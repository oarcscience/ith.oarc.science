PREFATORY NOTE.

 

This book is printed by the generosity of Mr. E. K. Warren, an American
friend of the Samaritans, and is furnished to the High Priest in order
that its sale may afford a small revenue for the Samaritan colony. These
people are very poor, and tourists who wish to assist in the maintenance

Of the school can do so by the purchase of this and other books for sale
by them.

The editor desires to ask American tourists visiting Palestine to make
their purchases of Samaritan books as directly as possible from the
priests at Nablous (Shechem). Spurious manuscripts are for sale by
dealers and others. The High Priest guarantees that all copies of the
Samaritan books sold at the Synagogue are correct and entire, and that
the proceeds go to the school.

Throughout many centuries this singular little sect has continued to
live under the shadow of its holy mountain. Some good purpose, surely,
God will yet reveal through their existence. This book, which is curious
and interesting, will assist to a correct understanding of their life
and teaching.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

 

The following work was prepared, at the request of the editor, by the
Samaritan High Priest, and is designed to answer the questions which are
most frequently asked of the Samaritan priests, both by strangers and by
some of their own communion. He has entitled the book, "Book of
Enlightenment for the Instruction of the Inquirer." It is written in
Arabic in neat manuscript, the quotations from Scripture being in the
Samaritan Hebrew, and written in red ink.

It cannot be pretended that the questions are in every case those that
the average American scholar is most eager to purpose. But the book as a
whole is not only interesting but instructive. It is a succinct
statement of the present tenets of the Samaritans, and a fine example of
their dialect. The attention of scholars is increasing directly to the
Samaritans for the valuable side light which their customs throw on many
questions of Jewish practice. The editor believes that this is a
permanently valuable document.

The questions which the High Priest undertakes to answer are the
following: -

1.                   Concerning *the duration of the plagues of Egypt.
-* His answer is, that the whole time covered by the plagues, including
the intervals between them, was two months and a half.

2.                   Concerning *the number and classification of the
miracles. -* He counts the number as eleven, holding that the sign of
the rod in the hand of Moses should be counted a sign in itself, in
addition to the specific miracles wrought by it, in the plagues. He
classifies the miracles as those wrought by God alone, those wrought by
God through Moses, those wrought through Aaron, and those in which both
Moses and Aaron employed.

3.                   Concerning *the origin and significance of the
ceremonial year. -* He holds that the new calendar established at the
time of the Exodus was really the reestablishment of the calendar begun
at the creation.

4.                   Concerning *the time of the institution of the
Passover. -* This leads him into a full discussion of all that is
involved in the Passover, and incidentally brings in the condemnation of
a heretic who taught that the prohibition of fire which belongs to the
Sabbath does not apply to the Passover. This heretic, who is nameless
here, lived in 1753 A.D. But he did not succeed in gaining converts,
even his own wife deserting his teaching; and the priest offers a prayer
for his restoration, though he would appear to have been long dead.

5.                   Concerning *the Passover when the date falls on the
Sabbath. -* The answer is, that, in this case, the sacrifice must take
place on Friday, after sunset. To this answer he appends proof that
Mount Gerizim is the one place where this sacrifice should be offered.

6.                   Concerning *the forty years in the wilderness. -*
The answer is, that the ordinances of the Passover, Circumcision, and
the Shekinah were faithfully observed.

7.                   Concerning *the fasts of Moses. -* The answer is,
that Moses fasted for three periods of forty days each, and not merely
two such periods.

8.                   Concerning *the writing of the Commandments. -* The
answer, is, that the Commandments were written for the sake of verbal
accuracy and permanent preservation, and the greater reverence paid to a
certain word of God, which might have been lost or corrupted if
transmitted orally.

9.                   Concerning *the revelation of the Torah. --* The
answer, given at great length and with wide variety of proof, is, that
the complete Torah was written in a single roll by the hand of God, and
came down to Moses complete. The apparent exceptions are noted, and the
main proposition is established by seven proofs.

10.               Concerning *the two stone tablets. --* The answer is,
that the first set of two tablets was created by God on the third day of
creation. The inscription was in horizontal lines and in uncial
characters. The writing miraculously disappeared when Moses broke the
stones; the breaking of them if the writing had remained would have been
either impossible or a great sin. The second set Moses hewed out, but
God wrote on them. The size was as follows: length, one and one half
cubits; breadth, three fourths of a cubit, combined thickness, two and
one half cubits, completely filling the ark.

11.               Concerning *the tablets of testimony. --* The answer
is, that the stone tablets were called the tablets of testimony because
they were a living testimony and covenant, testifying both the will of
God and the promise of his people.

12.               Concerning *the transcription of the Torah. --* The
answer is, that the written Torah was given to Moses between the two
sets of tablets containing the Commandments, and was copied by Moses and
the priests. Whether the original copy, written directly by God, was
ever taken out of the tent, where Joshua guarded it, is disputed. Some
hold that it was exhibited once in seven years. The two copies made by
Moses were all that were commonly seen.

13.               Concerning *the Jordan. --* The answer is, that the
Jordan is the river of Law. There the manna ceased, and the Law became
fully operative.

14.               Concerning *the shining of Moses' face. --* The answer
is, that this phenomenon- the more remarkable because Moses had been
fasting for forty days- was due to the effulgence of the angel Gabriel,
who, without the knowledge of Moses, lent him his own presence and
celestial brightness.

15.               Concerning *the water at Rephidim. --* The answer is,
that the smiting of the rock was an authentication of Moses, and a
rebuke to those who complained.

16.               Concerning *the battle with the Amalekites. --* The
answer is, that this was a testimony to the nations of the favor of
Jehovah for his people Israel.

17.               Concerning *the reason for not destroying the
Amalekites earlier. --* In order that Israel might know that its
strength was in Jehovah. In this connection the High Priest goes outside
the Torah, and, quoting from "the book attributed to Joshua," refers to
the stopping of the sun as an event of this campaign. The battle
occurred on Friday, he explains, and the standing of the sun was to
preserve the Sabbath unbroken by the battle.

18.               Concerning *the time of Jethro's visit. --* It
occurred in the second year of the Exodus.

19.               Concerning *the sons of Moses. --* They returned with
their mother, and their descendants still live, nomads, but monotheists.
In this connection the High Priest refutes the slander against Moses,
that, after the departure of Zipporah, Moses married a negress. Against
the Jews, to whom the priest attributes this slander, he cries, "May God
fight them for this!" The woman, he says, was none other than Zipporah
herself, and the word does not mean "Black" but "beautiful."

20.               Concerning *the heir of an adulteress. --* The high
priest, who condemns her to death, inherits her property.

21.               Concerning *the face of Laban. --* Jacob read the
heart of Laban in his face, and knew that he was in disfavor. The face
reveals the heart.

22.               Concerning *Oaths. --* The High Priest classifies
these, with some elaboration, into oaths permissible and prohibited; the
prohibited oaths are of three kinds- those of falsehood, conjecture, or
triviality; and the permissible, those that affirm truthfully and
reverently.

23.               Concerning *the inheritance of a woman who marries
outside the tribe. --*Her inheritance remains to her heirs within the
tribe. It is forfeited so far as she, her husband, and her children are
concerned.

24.               Concerning *the use of rennet. --* The prohibition of
seething a kid in its mother's milk had not been carried, so far as the
High Priest knows, to the point of forbidding the use of the kid's
stomach in the making of cheese. When attention was called to this,
however, he investigated the matter; and while he could find no question
of this particular in the literature of his people, it seemed to him
clear that the use of rennet was a violation of the Law, so he
prohibited it, establishing a new precedent. In this, however, he does
not condemn those who preceded him, as what they did in violation of the
Law in this regard was done inadvertently.

25.               Concerning *the abridgment by laymen of the authority
of the priesthood. --* Some laymen having insisted that there should be
a group of lay associates with the priests to pass upon questions where
the rights of the priesthood are involved, the High Priest refutes their
claim, showing that the laity have no right to intermeddle in matters of
his character, and incidentally showing with how great respect the high
priest himself ought to be treated.

The High Priest closes by hurling two questions at those who oppose him.
The first is, that they will explain the command not to remove the
ancient landmark. The second is, that they explain the command, "Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." With these two arguments- one
against the method, and the other against the spirit, of those who
oppose him- the High Priest closes the book.

THE BOOK OF ENLIGHTENMENT.

 

IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD, IN WHOM IS MY TRUST. At some
previous times, on many occasions, members of my own tribe have asked me
questions, the solution of which was hidden from them. I have answered
these inquiries from time to time in accordance with the best efforts of
my weak mind and poor understanding. I have wished also to record the
substance of those answers, both for safekeeping, and for the benefit of
following generations. *I pray God for his help. Amen.*

Praise be to God, the quintessence of Unity; the indivisible and
eternal;

To him who is far above either mother or son;

To the forgiver of sins to every on that repents with purity of
conscience;

To him who overlooks shortcomings, and consoles the disconsolate hearts;

To him who alone is perfect and eternal, and liable neither to malady
nor disease;

He is eternal and immutable, far above destruction, or any possible
damage;

He is the Everlasting, who is too exalted to be represented either by
image or likeness;

And is far above measurement or drawing.

He is described by the most exalted names;

To him belongs the ineffable name "AHIH ASHR AHIH."

He is the one who hears and beholds all things.

Verily he hears the flowing of water in the most parched wilderness,

And sees the black ants in the darkest recesses of the rock.

There is no God but he;

None but he is worthy to be worshipped.

He is invisible, eternal in his eternity,

And Lord of all the heavens.

Exalted and blessed be his Name!

He is praised in the secret and in the open;

In the conscience and by the tongue;

Inwardly and outwardly.

He is the only judge,

Who will avenge himself on the rebellious on the last day.

*Holy be his great name! Amen.*

 

 

I.        THE DURATION OF THE PLAGUES OF EGYPT.

I have been asked, concerning the wonders which took place with respect
to Pharaoh and his people, How long did each and all of the plagues
last? The answer is as follows: -

As to the period during which the wonders took place by the hand of our
lord, the apostle Moses (upon whom be peace),\[1\] while he was in
Egypt, it was that of two months and a half.

The first wonder took place in the eleventh month, and the last took
place in the first. It is so affirmed by our traditions, handed down
from father to son, and is so accepted and agreed upon by the people of
Israel.

We believe that the wonder of the staff that turned into a serpent
lasted less than a single day. As to the wonder of blood, it lasted
seven days; for we read: "And seven days were fulfilled after
Jehovah\[2\] had smitten the river." The period of the wonder of frogs
lasted two days. That of the plague of lice is not mentioned. Some
assert that the plague has continued on Egypt ever since that day\[3\].

The plague of flies lasted only one day, and left them on the day
following. The miracle of the destruction of the cattle lasted only one
hour. As to the wonder of the boils with blains, it lasted a whole week.
The miracle with the hail lasted one day; likewise lasted the plague of
locusts. The miracle of darkness lasted three days, as we read: "For a
period of three days no man saw his brother." The period of the killing
of the first-born lasted one single hour. To one who might make the
statement that these periods would not make out the total time of two
and one half months, as previously indicated, the answer is, that there
transpired some intervals of time between one miracle and another. It is
asserted that the time divisions were uniform, and that each was of
seven days, including the period of each miracle and the interval; for,
as soon as the miracle of blood ceased, the Nile let loose on them its
frogs, and the whole earth was filled with them. However, a certain
amount of space elapsed after each miracle, that the two apostles might
have time to carry their message to Pharaoh and to receive his reply
thereto, and act accordingly. Thus the whole period of miracles amounted
to two months and a half.

*And God possesses the best knowledge of all things.*

 

###### II.      THE NUMBER AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE MIRACLES.

The next question is concerning the meaning of the words "Pharaoh shall
not listen to you."

The first purpose of this prediction is in order that the words of God
may be confirmed; namely, "Pharaoh shall not listen to you, and I will
produce my power upon the Egyptians." It was God's purpose that Pharaoh
should know and feel, together with his people, these signs and wonders
while he was still hardened in his unbelief.

Secondly, that these miracles might be a warning to those who should
come later on. Otherwise it would have been possible for God to destroy
Pharaoh with his people in the twinkling of an eye. In fact, God desired
by this prediction and his delay to show the greatness of his apostle
and the veracity of his statements; he therefore performed these
astounding wonders through him as a memorial to all the generations, in
order that the one who reads them, and meditates on them, may continue
in his fidelity to him and consider and fear the treacherous unbeliever.
He made us know, therefore, that the unwillingness of Pharaoh to hearken
unto his two messengers resulted in what he said," that my miracles may
be multiplied in the land of Egypt." The genuineness of the mission of
these two men was proved; for we read: "and Moses and Aaron performed
all these miracles" (Ex.xi.10). There exist among the learned men some
who claim that these miracles amounted to ten in number, thus omitting
from their reckoning the miracle of the staff which was turned into a
serpent. Some say that the latter is only a sign, and not a miracle. But
those who claim that the number of miracles is ten do unconsciously
prove it to be twenty, for, according to them, the happening of the
miracles is miraculous and its disappearance is also miraculous.

It is more correct, however, to count them as eleven miracles, for the
matter of the staff was both a sign and a miracle, according to the
statement of God: "Show me a sign," or a miracle (Ex. Vii. 9); for a
sign is in itself a miracle. This statement is proved by the words of
God, which have already been quoted (Ex. xi. 10), which verse includes
all the miracles that have transpired. The same is affirmed by more than
one of God's statements, as in the same chapter and verse, "and God
hardened the heart of Pharaoh; he neither hearkened unto them nor let
the people depart from his land."

These miracles include within themselves many others, the details of
which are lengthy and numerous. Here are, however, some of the principal
divisions.

1.       The bringing of the flies, murrain, and the killing of the
first-born. These are the direct doings of God, without the
instrumentality of the two apostles. It must be understood, however,
that the message which accompanied these wonders was delivered by Moses,
who, with his brother, knew about them.

2.       Those which were done by God by the hand of Moses alone, while
Aaron had simply to notify Pharaoh with the words of his brother. They
are the hail, the locusts, and the darkness. These were done simply by
Moses, and Aaron had only in the intercession which accompanied them.

3.       These which God performed by the hand of Aaron, while Moses had
only to give command. They are the turning of the staff into a serpent,
the miracle of frogs, and that of lice.

4.       Those in which both brothers took part. They are the turning of
water into blood, and the boils.

But the real agent of all was indeed God (who is highly exalted). He
only used these two apostles to prove the truthfulness of their message,
and to show forth their high character and standing, and that the rest
of the world might know, as we have already stated. The line found in
Ex. Xi. 9 does simply indicate to us that there were performed ten
wonders on Pharaoh; and that, in spite of their bitterness and hardship,
in spite of the tortures which he suffered therefrom, he did not let the
children of Israel depart from his land except after the killing of the
first-born, which wonder makes the eleventh. Compare Ex. Vii. 3: "And I
will . . . . multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. But
Pharaoh will not hearken unto you until I lay my hand on Egypt, and
bring out my hosts, my people the children of Israel, from the land of
Egypt." The laying of his hand does not refer to the killing of the
first-born: "And I will stretch forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all
my wonders which I shall perform in the midst of it. Thereupon he shall
let you depart" (Ex. Iii. 20). This verse refers to the performance of
all the wonders. *And to God belongs the best knowledge.*

 

III.          THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CEREMONIAL YEAR.

I have been asked, concerning the passage "This month shall be to you
the beginning of months" (Ex. Xii.2), Did the Israelites know, previous
to this statement, that this month was the first month of their year, or
did they begin so to look on it afterwards? The following is in answer.
*And my success comes from God.*

Yes; they knew it as the first month from ancient times; for, in the
account of the deluge (Gen. viii. 13), we read: "In the six hundredth
and first year and the first month, on the first day of the month," etc.
The same mention is given in Ex. xii. 2, in order that the noble and
exalted nature of the month might be shown, and that we might know that
the delivery of the children of Israel from Egypt's bondage took place
thereon. There is, however, a stronger reason. It is called the first
month of the year, that we may thereby find with exactness the various
times of the year which we are commanded to observe, and as such they
are called the days of fulfillment of righteousness. During the same, on
well-known periods we have our festival days. Compare the reference
given in Ex. Xii. 3, "Speak to the congregation of Israel, saying, that
on the tenth of this month, they shall take for themselves each a
sheep," etc. Read as far as the sixth verse, wherein it is said, "and it
shall be kept by you until the fourteenth of this month." From these
references we conclude that this month was the first, and with it the
year begins; that on the tenth day of the same month sacrificial
offerings are to be chosen and kept till the close of the fourteenth
day. The sacrifices should take place on the evening of the night of the
fifteenth of the month. Beginning with that day up to the twenty-first,
unleavened bread must be eaten for seven days; and that day, which is
the twenty-first, must be spent in the service of God. In this manner
the arrangement of festival days was made out, each according to his
time and month, as their order is given in the Book of the Law; and that
is why the month is called the first.

As to the command that the celebration of the Passover on its proper
times should take place to the end of generations, it is because the
offering of Passover during the days of Darkness are equivalent to those
of the entire year. They are equivalent to the peace offerings. To
continue to celebrate the same will lead us to the days of the
appearance of God's Pleasure and the coming of the second prophet. The
mystery which affirms God's Pleasure, falling as it does in this month,
will doubtless be approved to us that the return of God's Pleasure will
be during the same month, namely, the first. As to the command of God in
reference to the celebration of the Passover in its time, one is
referred to Ex. Xii. 17: "Ye shall observe and fulfill this day in your
generations as an eternal ordinance"; "Ye shall keep this command as an
eternal ordinance to thee and to thy children" (ver. 24). Again: "Thou
shalt keep this ordinance in its time from year to year" (Ex. Xiii. 10).
Compare also Deut. xvi. 1: "Keep the month of Abib." Thus it appears
that the month of Abib is the first month, corresponding to April. The
keeping of this month is simply for giving praise and tanks to God for
having saved them from the servitude of the Egyptians. They should also
continue to mention the reason for God's action in bringing them out of
Egypt. See, therefore, Deut. xvi. 12: "and remember also that thou wert
a slave in the land of Egypt." As to the usefulness of celebrating this
ordinance from year to year as the ages pass, it consists in blotting
out the sins of each year as long it is kept on the first month, which
is April, when occur the return of God's Pleasure and the reappearance
and reestablishment of the Shekinah on Mount Gerizim. As to the time and
place, both are proved by the word of God. The Shekinah was established
in the wilderness by Moses on the first month, and when our lord Joshua
(upon whom be peace) set it up on Mount Gerizim, it was on the first
month. Its return will be by the will of God on the first month. And
that is the reason why God commanded and declared the keeping of its
season. As to the place, it shall be in the chosen place, the place
whose selection was revealed after their entrance into the Holy Land. No
other place shall be substituted for it; only in it and within its
boundaries. In proof of the same, compare Deut. xvi. 5: "It shall not be
lawful unto me to sacrifice the Passover within any of the towns, " etc.
and: "But it must be in the place which the Lord thy God has chosen that
his name may dwell there. There shalt thou sacrifice the Passover in the
evening at sunset," etc. This place is Mount Gerizim. *And God knows all
things.*

 

IV.          THE TIME OF THE INSTITUTION OF THE PASSOVER.

Were the apostles Moses and Aaron given the ordinance of the Passover,
and the manner of its performance, on the first day of the first month,
or on some other of its days previous to the fourteenth?

There is a variety of opinions given by the learned men. Some claim that
the probability is that the command was given on the first of the month,
with the provision that on the tenth they should choose the offerings
and keep them under surveillance until the evening of the fourteenth.
During these days the offerings would have been washed daily, and
cleansed and purified from all the blemishes and forms of animal filth
until the Egyptians were assured that Israel was ready to offer them to
his God. Their intention was revealed during this period of four days,
and the Egyptians could not pretend that the Israelites had sacrificed
their offerings in a concealed manner. There are others who claim that
the command was given by God only on the fourteenth of April, on the day
known as Alfajool. In proof of the same compare Ex. xi. 4: "In the midst
of the night I will go out into the midst of the land of Egypt."
Pharaoh, who realized that every threatening made him by the apostle
Moses (upon whom be peace) would be fulfilled, placed guards around his
own first-born prince, lest he should perish with the first-born of the
Egyptians. Naturally he commanded them to watch over his son without
remittance, and not to sleep throughout the whole night. The guards were
probably men of trust, famous for their courage and daring, and they
obeyed the command of Pharaoh with all diligence. While they were in the
most careful act of watchfulness over the first-born of Pharaoh, behold
the latter was dead in the midst of them, while they were around him and
without having noticed any one entering among them. These words belong
to the high priest Merkah (may God's pleasure be upon him). Amen.

Now if any one should say that, if God's command was given on the
fourteenth of the month, he would not have said, also, "on the tenth of
this month," in reply to this question it must be said that the words of
God here form a part of the ordinance of the Passover, and they were a
command to those of the coming generations, for he said also: "That
which remaineth of it until mourning shall be burned in fire" (Ex. xii.
10); while they did not remain in Egypt, but rather got up early and
left in all haste.

Now the reconciliation of this command of the Passover in a year when it
shall fall on the Sabbath will be given in its time, if God will help.

The learned elder, of blessed memory, Ishmael Arrabjee, mentioned in his
book named "Hitoroth,"- that is to say, Legislation, - informs us that
the command of the Lord to the two apostles took place on the day known
to us as the day of Alfajool, while they were still in Egypt on the
night of the Passover.

Thus our learned men differ. *And God possesses the best knowledge.*

This book became extinct in the twelfth century, because none took care
of it in those days. Part of it is still with the writer, and another
part with some of the Samaritan people. If God will grant me the
required years I shall gather what can be found according to my ability.
It contains Toroot and Mosoot, and possesses some fine interpretations.
These words belong to my uncle, the generous and literary sheik Shamsu-
Deen Sadkah. May God grant him forgiveness; for it is a very interesting
book. *And the knowledge of the unknown belongs to God.*

*Remarks concerning the Ordinance of the Passover.*

Our people who swell in the villages and countries which are more or
less remote from the Chosen Place used to sacrifice the offerings of the
Passover where they lived. We know also, from verified reports, that in
those days a party that belonged to the Chosen Place used to burn large
fires upon the top of Mount Gerizim, that those living in the adjacent
countries, such as Askelon, and Caesarea, and other towns, might see the
same and act accordingly. Those who came and sacrificed in the Chosen
Place were permitted to sacrifice either sheep or oxen, but those who
sacrificed in other places were not permitted to sacrifice, except
sheep. But in our generation, and ion the past ones beginning from a
period of three hundred years ago. It has been agreed that offerings
shall be made nowhere except on the Chosen Place, or if the mountain
itself should ever become impossible, then on its slope or in places as
near to it as practicable.

This is to harmonize with the saying of God in Deut. xvi. 5: "It shall
not be lawful unto thee to sacrifice the Passover within any of thy
gates, \[that is, in towns,\] which the Lord they God has given thee,
but only in the Place which the Lord thy God has chosen, that his name
might dwell therein. There shalt thou sacrifice the Passover."

Again, the custom has not varied from ancient times until the present
(that is, from the period of two hundred years ago until now), that only
sheep, and none else, shall be used for sacrifices. In our days it has
been agreed to choose only sheep of white color, because that is the
color of the best and the noblest of the sheep. He who lives in any
other place beyond the boundaries of the Chosen Place must hasten to the
Chosen Place, and there sacrifice the Passover. Should he be late in
coming without having any legal cause to delay him, he commits a great
sin, and becomes liable to what God ordered in Num. ix. 13: "If a man be
clean, and does not make a journey, and has failed to sacrifice the
Passover, that soul shall be cut off from among the people; for he has
not sacrificed to God in season. That man shall bear his own sins." If a
man asks, How can a man bear his own sins if he has been cut off from
his own people? And, Did he not pay for his sins by having been killed?
The answer is, that since his action was intentional, his sins will be
counted against him till the day of vengeance, when, in the day of
judgment and account, he shall be compelled to render an account of his
sins and shall be punished for them. His killing became necessary both
because he has offended his Lord, and also in order that others in this
world may be led to consider and not transgress likewise.

Questions of this character are numerous in the Law. Among the
conditions of the Passover is that the sacrifices shall be chosen on the
tenth of the month and kept with diligence until the time of their
offering, according to the command of God in Ex. xii. 3, etc.: "On the
tenth of this month they shall take for themselves every man a lamb
according to the houses of their fathers, a lamb for every house; and if
the house be too small for a lamb, the family shall join in company with
its neighbor who lives nearest to his house according to the numbers of
souls," etc., to the line where it is said, "the same shall be kept
until the fourteenth day of the month." During these five days the
sacrifices must be examined, and the condition of the animals found out,
lest they have some of the objections to disqualify them, such as
blisters, which is characteristic of the sheep, or a redness of eye, or
a possibly fatal disease. Their hoofs must be cleansed; especially those
parts which grow within the hoofs, for they are liable to much dirt, and
whatever defects they may be found to possess disqualify them from being
sacrificed. A sheep is particularly disqualified by such a blemish as a
break in the leg or defect in sight. All their members should be
cleansed from dirt; for they tread upon the defiled things while walking
in the streets and highways. Occasionally there grow between their hoofs
diseased parts which disqualify them.

Every Israelite must be taxed according to his share with the cost of
those sacrifices to fulfill the command of the Lord, "According to their
souls' price"; and this command includes all, the man and the woman and
the child. Any one who is not taxed, and does not pay out of his own
material substance, cannot have sacrifices. But he who is too poor, and
does not possess anything in this world, may serve in the preparation of
the sacrifices, and substitute his labor for money, and thus make up
what he would have been taxed as his share. And if a man lives with a
family, and has always been looked upon as a member of it, he may pay
the taxes that will cover all its members, whether they be wife, child,
or servants, in accordance with the words of God found in Ex. xii. 4:
"If the house, however, has no one to pay the full price, it may join
with its nearest neighbor, and the price be divided in accordance with
the number of those who partake of the sacrifice." This, of course, was
in the days of the large growth and multitude of the Israelites, but
when their conditions changed for the worse, and their number decreased
exceedingly, a number of them, large or small, would agree and undertake
to procure their sacrifices as they saw fit. But nowadays, on account of
our small number, we make a common fund of the little we possess. We all
gather together into one company and have one furnace, and this has been
done for nearly one hundred and twenty-five years. This we do because of
our weakness and ill prosperity, and on account of the days of darkness.
It is not permissible for any one to sacrifice except with his own
relations. Of course the married woman, wherever she is, will sacrifice
with her husband and will eat with him.

Among other ordinances is one that, on the fourteenth day, all the
people of Israel should cleanse their houses and dwelling places, and
clear them out entirely of leaven, according to Ex. xxiii. 18: "Do not
offer thy sacrifices with leavened bread, and let no fat of the Passover
remain until morning." Therefore, the people of Israel agreed not to eat
leavened bread on that day. Moreover, in order that any leaven
previously eaten may have been digested thoroughly in the body, they eat
not leavened bread on the fourteenth, lest they violate the words of the
Lord by eating it for eight days. Compare Ex. xii. 18: "By an ordinance
forever ye shall eat unleavened bread in the first month on the
fourteenth day at even until the twenty-first at even." According to
this command, seven days only must be completed.

Another condition is, that none of the people of Israel should offer
sacrifices unless he be pure in body, void of all defilements and their
causes. He must not have the least reason of being defiled.

Another condition is, that the whole people should gather together,
according to Ex. xii. 6: "And the whole company of the children of
Israel should kill it at evening, " that they all may witness the
offerings of God, and all may remember his favors upon them and upon
their forefathers, and the signs and wonders which he performed for
them, their delivery from servitude.

This remembrance is necessary/ Compare Ex. xii. 14: "It shall be a
memorial unto you this day." Compare also what Moses said, "Remember
also this day" (Ex. xiii. 3). Much can be said in reference to these
commands.

During the celebration of the Passover the people must indulge greatly
in praises, in exultations and glorifications, and must not cease doing
so throughout the whole night; for it is called the Night of God.
Compare, with others, Ex. xii, 42: "This night belongs to God; it shall
be kept by the children of Israel in all their generations."

Another condition is, that the offering should be sacrifices at evening,
not before and not after. It must be done as the sun goes under, that it
may have a well-defined demarcation. As to our custom when the Passover
falls on the Sabbath, it will be explained later on, by God's Word.

Another condition is, that the sacrifice which is offered must be
examined internally, lest it may have broken bones, or weak lungs, or
any internal disease.

Another condition is, that all its fat, including the two kidneys, must
be taken away, for if any of these remain with it it cannot be offered.
The right shoulder, together with the fat, must be removed, before it
can be broiled with the meat.

Another condition is, that it must be broiled thoroughly in fire. There
is no question about the verse in Deut. xvi. 7. It does not imply that
the meat should be cooked with water, for the command has already been
given that it should not be eaten raw or cooked with water."

Another condition is, that it must be salted according to the common
taste. It must not be eaten without salt. Compare Lev. ii. 13: With all
thine oblations thou shalt offer salt."

Another condition is, that it must be eaten in the middle of the night,
and all those who partake of it must do so in the guise of men who are
about to go on a journey and are prepared to travel. They must be girded
in the middle; must have their leather shoes on their feet, and their
staves in their hands, according to Ex. xii. 11: "Thus shall ye eat it.
Your loins must be girded, your sandals must be on your feet and your
staves in your hands." In other words, in eating it the triumph and joy
of the Exodus may be celebrated, for it is a Passover and a salvation
from the oppression in which our forefathers found themselves: "Ye shall
eat it greedily, for it is a Passover to God." Thus they would remember
the departure of the forefathers from Egypt. They ate it while on the
point of departure, and they ate it with greediness, on account of the
anxiety caused by the impending journey: "For haste hast thou left
Egypt: that thou mayest remember thy departure out of the land of Egypt
all the days of thy life" (Deut. xvi. 3).

Another condition is, that it must be eaten with unleavened bread and
bitter herbs. As to the eating of it with unleavened bread, it is to
remind them of the state of oppression and poverty and difficulty in
which they were while in Egypt; for unleavened bread was called, in
another place, *lehem eneh*, that is, "the bread of the poor" For often
the poor, and those on the point of a long journey on account of their
poverty, haste or hunger, would take the flour, and knead it and bake it
all at once, and eat it in haste without waiting for it to be leavened.
The traveler may do likewise from his haste or the anxiety which he
feels. He may become impatient should he wait until it becomes leavened.
*But God possess the best knowledge.*

As to the eating of bitter herbs, it is that they may remember also the
bitter lives which their forefathers lived, the oppressive servitude and
the excessive tasks with which they were cumbered. As to the making of
unleavened bread, it must be done with all carefulness lest any foreign
matter be mixed with it. It must be selected from the whole amount of
wheat chosen for the season. It must be cleansed, especially at its
grinding at the mill; it must not be gathered up out of the wheat which
has been threshed by the oxen, for while they are drawing the threshing
instrument they might defile it by their urine and dung. Compare Lev.
xxii. 25: "Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread
of your God of any of these, because their corruption is in them; there
is a blemish in them; they shall not be accepted for you." Now if there
is no wheat of which the conditioned portion can be taken; if there be
no Israelitish farmers from whom the required amount can be taken, ears
of wheat must be picked at the time of harvest and preserved until it
can be prepared for the making of unleavened bread.

Another condition is, that the lamb must be roasted entirely as a whole,
with its head and its legs, without any part being cut off, except the
right shoulder, which is removed that the same may be eaten afterward,
being the property of the priests, the sons of Levi. Compare Ex. xii. 9:
"Its head with its legs and the inwards thereof."

Another condition is, that it must not be taken out from the place where
it is cooked; it must not be taken from one place to another: "Thou
shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh \`brought out of the house'"
(Ex. xii. 46), lest it may undergo some disqualification, or lest it may
be changed. No bone of it shall be broken. "Neither shall ye break the
bones thereof."

Another condition is, that no foreigner shall touch it, and no foreigner
shall eat of it except him who possess the religion of Israel and has
been circumcised, he may eat of it; he may sacrifice it as any of the
Israelites, according to Ex. xii. 44: "But every man's servant who is
bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat
thereof."

Now as to strangers, our Law says (in the same chapter, ver. 48): "When
a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the Passover of
Jehovah, if he be a male, let him be circumcised; then he shall be as
one born in the land." This statement includes any one, whether he be
stranger or not, who has taken up this religion and introduced himself
under the ordinances of the of the Law. He who does that, let it be
announced to him that his standing before God and in the house of the
Lord is like the standing of the Israelite. For he said in the same
chapter, "He shall be like a native in the land, for he has submitted
himself and restrained his passions unto the will of God. Let him
therefore be fruitful."

Another condition is, that its fat must be burned, and whatever fatness
may be found in the head and in the shoulder, and whatever may remain of
the flesh and bones and members, without leaving a particle of it, in
accordance with the command of God in Ex. xii. 10: "leave nothing of it
until the morning."

Every Israelite must cease working, that he may have a part in the
offering of the sacrifice. The least work must not be done, and he who
excludes the preparation of food in general, claiming that it can be
done on the day of the Passover, he has surely ignored the word of God,
for if any work were intended besides that of Passover the word "only"
or "singly" would not have been employed. For this work does surely
refer to the Passover only, and therefore the taking part in the
Passover is the only thing that can be done at the prescribed time, in
accordance with the command of God. If, however, the objector of these
explanations would suggest that God, in saying "for every soul," meant
that whatever may be eaten may be prepared on the day of the Passover,
but must not be eaten except by the Israelite who is pure, the answer
is, that God had this command only for the children of Israel, and if he
had simply said, "Whatever may be eaten by every soul may be prepared,"
we might be convinced. But since he added a conditional word, which is
*ibdo,* namely, "only" or "singly," and concluded his saying by the word
*ikm*, that is, "to you," it follows that he meant the Passover, and
that they alone were responsible for its observance. *And to God belongs
the highest wisdom.*

If, however, some one may say that the preparation of the is simply
limited to a day, but not the preparation of other food God meant for
two days, namely, that day of the Passover and the day of the Feast of
Unleavened Bread, he is surely mistaken; for the saying of Jehovah
referred only to the day of the Passover. Yes, God said that the least
doing must not be done in them, namely, in those two days, but he made
an additional remark in Ex. xii.16, which surely refers to the Passover
only. The duty of every Israelite should be to be diligent and watchful
lest something disqualifying might happen to his sacrifice.

Another condition is, that early in the morning the whole host shall
rise and depart to their places and homes. Compare Deut. xvi. 7: "Then
in the mourning go to and leave for thy tents." The duty of every
Israelite is, that he should make known the joy of the Passover in his
home, and should bless God for the salvation of his home, and should
bless God for salvation of his forefathers from their enemies; and for
the standing, the high standing which is only his; and for the help by
which he has been enabled to fulfill his Passover duty, especially in
the days of darkness; for the absence of harm done by his enemies; and
for the liberty given him in preparing his sacrifice. Such things must
be attributed to God's mercy and favor, and should be looked upon as the
best guide to submission to this will. It is indeed a marvelous thing
that, during the observance of the ordinance, none thinks of harming the
Israelite, whether it be his body or his property. It is in assurance of
the fulfillment of God's saying in Ex. xxxiv. 24: "No man shall desire
thy land when thou goest up to appear before the Lord thy God." Let the
Israelite watch over this holy day and cease from all works, in
accordance with Ex. xii. 16: "And the first day there shall be to you a
holy convocation, and on the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner
of work shall be done in them." This command is, of course, to include
the Passover and the seventh day, which is the first of unleavened
bread, "Save that which every man may eat, that alone may be done of
you." This exception is made, referring to Passover sacrifice and its
preparation; and whatever may be needed to attend to the same is
allowable. No other labor is permissible, and the Jewish people are in
error in their claim, for they have taken this verse as intended for
every feast in which they allow the cooking of all kinds of food. They
have abandoned the ordinance, and perform things which are no mentioned
in the holy Torah. They perform, however, the feast of unleavened bread,
but only in part. The Gentiles claim that the Jews used blood, human
blood, in their unleavened bread, which is, I believe, incorrect, and
the report of a slaughter, for blood is a defiling thing with them as it
is with us. *And to God belongs the best wisdom.*

But as to the ordinance of the Passover, the Jews have entirely
neglected it, although it is an ordinance given to all generations
forever. Compare Ex. xii. 17: "Ye shall keep this ordinance, for on this
very day I have brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt. Ye shall
observe and fulfill this day throughout your generations." Let the
reader answer, What other day than on the day of Passover did God bring
the children of Israel out of Egypt? And there can be no greater
testimony of this fact than this line in Ex. xii. 17: "Ye shall observe
this ordinance."

It is plain enough that the words above refer to the Passover, and that
all works on that day are unlawful, with the exception of the work which
concerns the preparation of the Passover. For the command as to the
prohibition of work on these two days was given before that of the
Sabbath; and as the praiseworthy and highly exalted God wished to
arrange for the rest of the annual feasts, he began with the commands
concerning the feast of the Passover and ended with that of the eighth
feast. He informed us that the standing of these feasts is as high as
that of the Sabbath; for he often implied the Sabbath in mentioning the
other feast days. Compare Lev. xxiii. 2: "The festival days of the Lord,
ye shall call convocations of holiness, these are festival days." Such
saying includes both the festival days and the Sabbath, for he has
coupled the Sabbath with the festival days: "Six days shalt thou do
work, but on the Sabbath there is a complete cessation of labor, a holy
convocation. The least work ye shall not do; it is a rest day in your
dwellings." The he began mentioning the festival days in their order,
and in the same manner the Sabbath; and as the Sabbath was devoted to
God, likewise the rest of the festival days are devoted to him. Compare
Lev. xxiii. 4: "These are the festival of the Lord which ye shall call
out in their seasons." Such a line is comprehensive, and the standing of
the one festival is of equal importance.

 

*The Condemnation of a Heresy as to the Use of Fire.*

What is wonderful in short-sighted and ignorant people who know little
of the fullest import of the holy law is, that they claim that the feast
of the Passover has nothing to do with the Sabbath, and does not have
the obligations of the Sabbath. Thus one Israelite living outside of our
own town in the year 1171 of the Hegira\[4\] did adopt a disgusting
custom, and resolved upon making fire in his home during the festival
days, claiming that fire is prohibited only on the Sabbath; as if,
according to this theory, joy cannot be obtained except by making fire!
Such persons are indeed ignorant; for, if joy is not obtained except
through fire, the Sabbath had been worthier, in which the prohibition of
fire is commanded. These words are taken from the learned sheik Mosallam
Almoyan Addanafy, who erred therein, for the man who has given birth to
such a deed is well nigh losing his religion. The reason for prohibiting
the making of fire, on this, as on other festival days, is, that work
need not be necessary. There is no exception which permits the making of
fire in their homes. And that is why the revelation concerning the
prohibition of fire was brought down just about the time the revelation
concerning the building of the Shekinah was brought down. Before the
apostle Moses (upon whom be peace) had given the tabernacle revelation,
he gathered the whole people, and made them acquainted with the command
of God concerning the keeping of the Sabbath and the prohibition of fire
making. Compare Ex. xxxv. 3: "Do not make any fire in all your dwellings
on the day of the Sabbath." We know well what is meant by the word
"day," namely, "from sunset to sunset." Compare Gen. i, 15; also Lev.
xxiii. 32: "From sunset to sunset ye shall cease from work." Thus we
know that by "day" we understand twenty-four hours, without paying
attention to those who claim that the meaning of the "day" her is
intended to imply only the period from sunrise to sunset, and excludes
the night. After that revelation the apostle gave them the instruction
concerning the building of the tabernacle. His insistence upon the total
abstinence from making fire on it should be observed. The man who took
upon himself the license of making fire upon the festival day was
induced by his action to commit greater offenses; for, as I have read
that this same heretic prepared on the festival day coffee for himself
and drank it; he also smoked tobacco, and as this commodity brought
about one of the principal confessions, he committed a great offense and
transgresses the command of the Lord concerning all festival days: "Ye
shall not do any work" (Lev. xxiii. 3). The action of that man caused
them to do exactly what might defile him; for on the festival days he
visited, and sat in conversation with, people of lewd character in cafes
and the like, and associated with people who differed with him in
religion. Like *Haggoyim* \[the Gentiles\] and others, instead of
spending the day in the worship of God, he spent it in idleness, and in
whatever might change and degrade the character of the day. He made
himself like the Jews, who may justly be called by the aforesaid name
for their deeds. All this was contrary to the sayings of God (whose Name
is exalted) that on such days fulfillment of righteousness must be done.
On such days our duties must be holy and pure; we must avoid al things
that may reflect upon the day, and all defilements or anything that may
have their shadows. We must be occupied in the worship of the exalted
God, in reading his law and the like, which includes prayer, reading of
appropriate portions, etc. This ignorant man, however, instead of
sanctifying the day, defiled it. The elements of purity cannot be
harmonized with those of impurity. Let it be known, therefore, that God
(to whom be praise) prohibited us from doing any work on such days as
are devoted to him, that he may fulfill righteousness on them by doing
whatever is pure and holy, and by avoiding whatever may desecrate and
defile us, that we who keep them may justly fulfill his sayings, "Ye
shall be sanctified and be holy, for I am holy." Such days must be kept
holy, and not defiled with works which may keep us away from worship, as
is the case on the rest of the common days.

And thou, O ignorant and obstinate man, consider what great favor God
bestowed upon his people Israel! He made them holy, set them apart, and
preferred them above the rest, and gave them feasts which may claim a
divine origin, and for a lawful purpose proceeding from the command of
the Lord God (who is highly exalted) which sets definitely their times
and seasons contrary to what may be found in another god. For no other
god has instituted these festival days, nor is our God their author, but
rather the god who made these customs is himself made by hands. Woe unto
thee if thou wilt persist in this obstinacy , and wilt refuse the
heritage with which the Lord of Creation has endowed thee! Consider also
what he has said about thee; about thy duty and about thy claim for him
concerning the observance of his times, Lev. xix. 2: "be ye holy for I
am holy, the Lord your God"; also in chapter xxvi,: "Be ye holy unto me,
I am the Lord God who hath set you apart from the nations, that ye may
be mine."

A most surprising thing, indeed, that persons who are well acquainted
with the purpose of these statements may act contrary to them. If the
ignorant may say, "I have done nothing; I have done only things which
are commanded in the law, and if the prohibitions of making fire during
the festival days were mentioned I would not have made fire," such a
statement would confirm his ignorance and his persistence therein. For
the command was not given to prohibit the making of fire, except that no
work, not even the lest, may be done, and there is no festival day, but
a command in regard to it was given as follows: "Every work that is to
be done thou shalt not do." About some of them he gave the following
command in Lev. xxiii. 21: "Ye shall call on that very day a holy
convocation for yourselves. The least work ye shall not do. It shall be
an ordinance in your dwellings forever and to all generations"; and if
the festival days had something in addition to the days of the Sabbath,
this day to which a reference is made by the same verse would be the
most worthy of all, for God instituted the Sabbath as the day of "the
short feast," and in that there is no difference between the Sabbath and
the rest in so far as prohibiting work entirely; for he said about the
Sabbath in Lev. xxiii. 3: "It is a Sabbath for the Lord in all your
dwellings." He also said in Lev. xxiii. 21, "An ordinance forever in all
your dwellings unto all your generations." The reference in the word
*Moshbotekim* is to the making of fire, for works may take place either
in the dwelling of man or outside of it, but the making of fire must
necessarily take place within the dwelling. "Do not make fire in all
your dwellings on the day of the Sabbath." In the reference where the
word *Moshbotekim* occurs , it is always given before *Dorotikim*, in
order that all generations may know that this command has been given
them beforehand, handed down from father to son as the time goes by; and
whenever a new generation rises up, its hoses may be seen void of fire
on all the festival days, as on the Sabbath. New generations should do
as those who preceded them in obedience to the command of God in Deut.
xxxii. 7: "Ask thy father, and he will inform thee; the elders, and they
will speak unto thee." This is exactly to answer any one who might
confide in the heresy referred to above, without heeding the righteous
truth, and following those who preceded him according to what they had
handed him and what they themselves practiced, believing that his mind
and knowledge are better than those of his ancestors. Such thinking as
this is an additional proof of his stupendous ignorance and lack of
knowledge, and of the scarcity of his understanding; for we have a
proverb which runs as follows: "The path of thy forefathers leads thy
steps to safety and truth." It is also said, "he who follows his own way
shall be led astray." If that man's mind was sane, others might have
followed him, but there was none who did so, not even his own wife. Thus
he was alone in his belief, and it is current among the rest of the
nations that the voice of the majority is the voice of truth, insomuch
that they say, "The voice of the people is the voice of God."

This is indeed the general impression; for of the large number of
learned teachers who are well known for their understanding of the
hidden mysteries of the words of the Law, and who have left behind them
several books, none did presume what this man has affirmed in his
doings. There were, indeed, men who could support their claims with
greater logic and in more charming style, but may God forbid that any
teacher, whether it be in the days of God's favor or in these days of
darkness, should do likewise. This man was led further by his ignorance,
so much so that he set apart the day of fasting, from the rest of the
festival days, and on it he claimed that that no fire should be made. He
lied twice in this statement; for he applied to this day a statement
which was given particularly for the sake of the Sabbath. But if it
applies to this day, why not to the rest of the festival days, which
have, on the whole, the same general plan and regulations?

If one should say that, in regard to the past, the Torah has declared
*Shebet Shebet*, namely, "A Sabbath to be kept," he could not infer from
that fire should not be made therein; for these same words were
mentioned in reference to the year of rest. Compare Lev. xxv. 2, "Thou
shalt keep a Sabbath unto the land"; and apparently, according to him,
fire must not be made during the entire year! But, will all that, work
was not prohibited. May God preserve us from doing after the manner of
this ignorant heretic, who is trying to establish an ugly heritage. May
he protect us from committing a similar error, and inspire us always
with obedience to him, and faithfulness to his worship. May he bring us
nearer to his pleasure. Verily he is a faithful hearer. May he also
bring to guidance this ignorant man, and take him off from his folly;
for truly he is in the lowest depth of ignorance. May he examine his
condition, and wake up in his soul, and combat himself and let folly
alone, and repent of his deed, and return to God, to the supreme and
exalted God, with a repentance that is pure and unselfish. If he will do
this, God may return to him, for he is merciful and gracious, for thus
he spoke of himself to those who may seek him, in Deut. iv. 29: "Return
to thy God, and he shall not forget thee, nor forget the covenant which
he has made with thy forefathers."

 

*End of the Condemnation.*

Let us now return to what may be said concerning the fulfillment of the
Passover ordinance. For our words have been, so far, quite brief in
mentioning the conditions of its fulfillment.

There remains yet a condition- that the eating of the Passover is
obligatory upon every Israelite, whether he be present or absent, and if
he be *tameth*, namely, "defiled." The eating of the unleavened bread
must last seven days completely from sunset of the fourteenth of the
first month; that is, from the beginning of the night of the fifteenth
till sunset of the twenty-first up till beginning of the night of the
twenty-second. In accordance with Ex. xii. 17-19, "an eternal ordinance.
In the first month on the fourteenth day thereof at sunset ye shall eat
unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month at sunset. Ye
shall eat seven days," namely, seven complete days. This is an eternal
ordinance. The fulfillment thereof is obligatory; for it is like
circumcision; there is no escape therefrom. But at the beginning of
night of the twenty-second day at sunset the end of these seven days is
declared without subtraction. And he who eats leavened bread in those
seven days must perish in accordance with the command of God in Ex. xii.
19: "He who shall eat leavened bread shall be cut off from the people of
Israel whether he be a stranger or a native of the land." The destroying
of all leavened food in all dwellings of Israel has been emphasized
again and again even in the places where their works, whether the
dwelling of man be in a vineyard or in a garden or in a field, even the
instruments of plowing and planting, must not be defiled therewith, for
God said in Deut. xvi. 4: "And there shall be no leaven seen with thee
in all thy borders seven days." Some of our learned men went so far as
to prohibit the keeping of *Burgol*, which is wheat boiled and coarsely
ground, or even bran, or any kind of leaven. They advise that such be
taken before the coming of the feast and be deposited in the houses of
neighbors among *Hagoyim* \[the Gentiles\], and be returned after the
passing of the feast, namely, the seven days of unleavened bread. I
presume that this advise is due to the extremity to which our people may
be reduced in destroying all leaven, for they indulge in those materials
which have been mentioned. They (may God multiply them), at the approach
of the feast, about the beginning of the first month, begin to clean up
all their food receptacles by putting a new coat of white zinc on their
brazen dishes and by buying new implements, such as china dishes and
ware, glasses, water jars, cups, and water pitchers. They also clean
their houses both in the interior and exterior. They wash all they have
of carpets, rugs, counterpanes, and blankets, leaving nothing of
household implements that may not be washed. All this is done before the
arrival of the feast. Still we go in this generation to make our
Passover in the plains outside of the town on Mount Gerizim in the
tents. We leave for that place two or three days before the feast, and
remain there till the second feast, remaining seven days on the mountain
until morning. We do according to the command given in Deut. xvi. 7, 8,
namely, "In the morning direct thyself, and return to thy dwellings
\[tents\]. Six days shalt thou eat unleavened food; and on the seventh
day there shall be a solemn assembly to the Lord thy God. Thou shalt do
no manner of work therein." And thus we do nowadays to the favor of the
exalted God. We pass seven days in our tents; and the day of
convocation, which is the seventh, we leave our tents for the holy
dwelling, which is the place of the temple and altar, and there we
perform our duties; and when the convocation has ended, each returns to
his tent and attends to his needs. At sunset they gather about the high
priest, each having in his hand some *hachamess*, - "unleavened bread,"
-- and the high priest reads, in company with those present, beginning
with the words, "For in the day of Jehovah," and so on to the end of the
surah.

After this, the surah beginning with the words "And the blood was," to
the end of that surah. They receive three addresses, reciting everything
in good order, and then they eat unleavened bread. On the morning of the
following day they immediately descend the mountain, each going to his
own business.

We have been brief in our words, avoiding lengthy and tiresome details,
but the one who desires to read further concerning the subjects may be
well satisfied in reading the book called "Attabakh," attributed to the
learned and wise sheik Hasam Assoory of Tyrus. *May God grant him
forgiveness, and gather us with him in the garden of delight. Amen.*

*V. THE PASSOVER WHEN THE DATE FALLS ON THE SABBATH.*

To the question, Suppose that the Passover should fall on the Sabbath,
why is it that sacrifices must take place on the day Friday after
sunset, and what are the reasons therefore? My answer here follows.

 

And my success comes from God.

Praise be to him who is a generous Giver.

Who directs to the right path,

Who does according to his own will,

And as he chooses to do.

 

In answer to this question, namely, of offering the sacrifice of the
Passover when it falls on the Sabbath, and why we are obliges to kill
the sacrifice on Friday, I would say, first, that on the Sabbath all
manner of work is absolutely prohibited, in accordance with the words of
the decalogue, "Do not do any work on it, for he who does any work on it
shall die." References of this nature are many in which work is
prohibited on the Sabbath. On this account our learned men (may the Lord
grant them forgiveness) inferred that the Passover should be done on
Friday, as he said, "Do not leave anything of it until the morning."
Then he added, "and whatever may be left of it until morning ye shall
burn with fire"; for this addition is surely meant to be performed in
case the Passover falls on the Sabbath, for why should God repeat in the
same line the same prohibition given before? He said, also, in another
place, in Deut. xvi. 4: "There shall not be left any flesh which thou
shalt sacrifice on the first day until morning." This, also, would
indicate to us that the sacrifice would take place only at sunset. It
surely explains what must be done in case the Passover falls on the
Sabbath. For the sacrifices then may be eaten on the Sabbath; and should
there be left any bones or parts of it or flesh, they must all be burned
in the night of Sunday. The following reference is given in regard to
the sacrifice of the Passover when it happens on the Sabbath: "On the
first month on the fourteenth day of the month, between the two
evenings, ye shall have the Passover for the Lord" (Lev. xxiii. 5). Now
God did not mention "between the two evenings,' except when he had in
view the falling of the Passover on the Sabbath. The evenings with us
number three: first, the going down of the sun in a westerly direction;
second, the immersion of the disk of the sun into the sea; and, third,
the disappearance of the redness of the western skies from the sun. Now,
whenever the Passover falls on the Sabbath, the killing of the
sacrifices takes place as the sun goes down, that is, after six o'clock
of the fourteenth. The ordinance of the Sabbath must not be violated;
therefore, whatever may be left of the sacrifice is placed under watch
until the night of the Sabbath after sunset, and should be burned then
on the altar, in the manner that we have already mentioned. *And to God
belongs the best wisdom.*

 

*Mount Gerizim.*

A few words affirming that Mount Gerizim is the chosen place; and
replying to the Jews, who claim that the place was intended to be
chosen, and was chosen, only at the hand of Solomon; and convincing all
with testimonies taken from the Law, well known and of legal nature, in
a brief manner. *And to God belongs the best wisdom.*

Our opponents claim that the chosen place appears only at the hand of
Solomon, and that there was no real temple in Israel before the time of
that king. Thus they attribute to the exalted Creator (to whom be
praise) but little knowledge of the past and future, for surely he could
not have known about the chosen place or he would have indicated it to
is chosen place or he would have indicated it to his chosen, to whom he
made great revelations. But God is higher, far above these things, for
they are contradicted strongly by passages of the Law. What otherwise
did God mean by his command to Abraham (to whom be peace) in Gen. xii.
1: "Now move out of thy land, and of the place of thy birth, and of the
house of thy father, and into the land which I shall reveal unto thee"?
Then it is said about Abraham: "And Abraham went into the land unto the
place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh. Then the angels of the Lord
appeared to him and announced to him the grant of this land unto his
seed" (ver. 9). From this same chapter we read: "And the angel of the
Lord appeared unto Abraham and said unto him, To thy seed will I give
this land." And this took place while our lord Abraham, asking him to
sacrifice his son, our lord Isaac (upon whom be peace), God's command
was given in this manner (Gen. xxii. 2): "Take thy only son, Isaac, whom
thou lovest, and go with him, journeying unto the land of Moreh," etc.

Now Abraham obeyed the command of the Lord, and after his son was
redeemed, he said in the same chapter, "God is seen," which is to mean
to-day, "in a mountain God is seen," meaning a mountain of God answers
prayers quickly. This is as much as was said about the mountain in the
days of our lords Abraham and Isaac (upon whom be peace). Concerning
what was said about it in the days of our lord Jacob (upon whom be
peace), we may write that when Jacob went to his uncle Laban, he slept
in the chosen place and had a dream, in which he saw a ladder reaching
the high heavens; and when he arose from his sleep he said, "No doubt
this is the house of God and the gate of heaven" (Gen. xxviii. 17). The
he made a vow to God, which was conditional upon God's favor and mercy.
Compare Gen. xviii. 20-22: "And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God be
with me, and preserve me bread to eat, and clothes to wear, and if I
return in peace to the house of my father, God will be my master, and
this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, shall be the house of God.
Also whatever thou giveth to me I shall surely tithe it for thee." And
after his return from his uncle's in possession of his desire and
fulfillment of his purpose which he prayed from his Lord, it is said in
Genesis xxxiii. 18, "And Jacob entered the city of Nablous \[Shechem\]
in peace." There he fulfilled what he had vowed upon himself to the
exalted Lord. From these testimonies it became plain unto us, and we
fully realize that the standing of Mount Gerizim is above all others. To
it the prayer of Moses refers in his hymn which he sung by the sea as in
Ex. xv. 17: "Thou shalt bring them, and plant them in the mountain of
thy inheritance, in the place which the Lord has chosen for his
dwelling, which thy hand has prepared, O God." Then he prayed for the
upbuilding of this place, as, in the same verse, we read, "O Lord, build
it up by thy might."

These passages do affirm unto us that there was then in existence a
chosen place, known to our fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (upon whom
be peace). If, however, we should surrender, and say, as our opponents
do, that our lord Abraham went to Jerusalem, and there he offered his
son Isaac as a sacrifice; that our lord Isaac slept and dreamed there,
and made a vow in the same, why was not Jerusalem singled out and made
known as a chosen place? Why was it left for David and Solomon to
discover that their great forefathers had been in error in supposing
Mount Gerizim to be the real sanctuary? Such a belief is faulty, and
cannot be trusted by a sane mind, namely, that our most high and exalted
Jehovah would command his prophets to go to places which are unchosen
and unknown. God (may his name be praised) is above all such
insinuations. The Jews err, and God is infallible. So much is enough for
those who desire the truth, and I pray God for his help in avoiding
false testimony and fallacious argumentation. *Verily he knows the
unknown, and covers the sins of those who groan from their iniquities.*

 

VI\. THE FORTY YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS.

I was asked by some, How long did the children of Israel remain in the
wilderness, and were the forty years solar or lunar? Did they offer the
Passover sacrifice and eat the unleavened bread, or did they not offer
the sacrifice of the Passover and eat unleavened bread, or did they
practice circumcision during their stay in the wilderness, as our
opponents claim? Did they offer the daily sacrifices or not, and the
monthly sacrifice, and those of the feast, while they had with them the
Shekinah, and fire was kept continually on the altar?

The children of Israel fulfilled all the ordinances which they were
commanded in the Torah, among them the Passover ordinance, for it is one
of the greatest ordinances. Our fathers used to perform it according to
the rules and regulations, and ate it with unleavened bread and bitter
herbs throughout the forty years. Our opponents claim that our fathers
ceased from celebrating the Passover during the period of forty years
which they spent in the wilderness. Against this statement I appeal to
God! How could they attend to this ordinance while they were in Egypt,
surrounded by the most oppressive conditions, and then neglect it when
they entered the wilderness with perfect liberty? How could they cease
from performing an ordinance which was given to them as long as the
world lasts, being at the time in a place where no one would oppose
them?

*Cattle for Sacrifice in the Wilderness.*

I am asked, Whence did they obtain the sacrifices, since they were in
the wilderness and had no cattle? Nay, they had their cattle with them,
and it is the same with which they left Egypt. Compare Ex. xii. 38:
"Also went with them a mixed multitude, and sheep and oxen and cattle in
a large number." Of these they used to offer their daily sacrifices, and
whatever sacrifices were required, according to the times and seasons.
They made the unleavened bread from the manna which was daily brought
down upon them, and was their food for a period of forty years. If the
opponents say that manna cannot be called bread, I will answer that such
a name be applied to it, for the Lord did so design it before bringing
it down to them: "Behold, I am raining upon you bread from heaven" (Ex.
xvi. 4).

Now, as to the period of forty years complete, I would say that the
manna was given them during that period, less two months of the first
year. And it is said that it did not cease from them except when they
encamped in the plain of Moreh, by the side of Mount Gerizim. The verse
"They ate manna until they entered into the boundaries of the Land of
Canaan" (Ex. xvi. 35), means that the same ceased from being given to
them when they arrived at the boundaries of the land of Canaan. As the
verse "The children of Israel ate manna forty years" means the forty
years were fulfilled, including the month and a half or two which
transpired of the first year without the manna. On the fifteenth day of
the forty-first year, when they began to eat of the fruits, the falling
of the manna ceased. Then they surely must have crossed the Jordan on
the tenth of the first month of that year. Which, according to
tradition, may have been Tuesday, or more accurately Wednesday. They
stopped in the Gilgal on Thursday, and they ate manna in it, and on
Friday they went out and gathered three omers of manna for each, which,
according to our traditions, is due to the fact that the blessed feast
of the Passover took place in that period. Some of our best chroniclers
say that the Passover took place on Monday. Thus their first feast in
the Holy Land was the Passover, and that on Monday, for they ate it of
unleavened bread made of the flour of the land which they baked; and
this is the true version of it, I think.

Those who claim that those who entered into the wilderness or were born
during the forty years were not circumcised make a terrible mistake.
What prohibited them from doing so? For they were commanded with this
ordinance from the times of our lord Abraham (upon whom be peace). They
understood how absolute and definite are the punishments of those who do
not perform it. Passages to that effect are numerous, for whosoever is
born among the Israelites, and is not circumcised on the eight day, is
not counted with the people, and that soul is destroyed from the number
of its people. What our opponents claim in this matter is unacceptable
and irrational, and so much is enough in this brief treatise. *I pray
thee, God, for the attainment of my desire and the grace of avoiding
falsehood and error. Amen, O God, and Amen.*

* *

VII\. THE FASTS OF MOSES.

A question concerning the fasting of our lord Moses: Was it forty days
during the first fasting, and forty days during the second only, or did
he undergo three fastings, namely three forties, according to what our
learned men have informed us? *May God's pleasure be upon them all.*

When did these fastings begin, and when did they end? The answer is
given through a plain Scriptural statement. *And God possesses the best
knowledge.*

The fastings of our lord Moses (may peace be his portion) were three in
number, each lasting forty days. The first one is mentioned in the surah
beginning with *Alah-Alai-Haharah,* where, in Ex. xxiv. 18, we read:
"And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights." Now when
Moses (upon whom be peace) departed from the presence of God, and went
down and saw what the people were doing, and beheld that accursed calf,
with that frightful scene around it, he throw the two tablets from his
hand and broke them at the base of the mountain, doing what we read was
done with the worshippers of the calf, for God destroyed them in that
time. Thus we read in Ex. xxxii, 30, 31: And in the morning Moses said
to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin, and I am about to ascend
before God and pray, and perhaps I will intercede for your sins;
therefore Moses returned to God." There he fasted for the second time
forty days, while interceding for the people, until God had accepted his
prayers and had forgiven the people. We know this from Deut. ix. 18:
"Then I prayed before Jehovah, as before, and during forty days and
forty nights I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of your sins
which ye have committed to do the evil thing before Jehovah to offend
him."

We know, besides, that God commanded him to make two other tablets like
the first one and commanded him to engrave them, as it is revealed in
Ex. xxxiv. 1: "Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tablets of stone
like the two first ones," etc. And in the second line of the same
chapter we read: "And be ye ready in the morning, and ascend in the
morning unto Mount Sinai." It is well known that this command of God
(may his name be praised) was given after the second fasting of forty
days. Compare Deut. x. 1: "At that time Jehovah said unto me, Hew thee
two tables of stone like unto the first." Moses hewed unto himself the
second two stone tablets on that day, and on the following he went with
them up into the mountain, for we read in Ex. xxxiv. 2: "And be ye ready
in the morning, and go up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and stand there
before me upon the top of the mountain. Let no man go up with thee."

While on this mountain he fasted forty days for the third time. For we
read in the same chapter, namely, Ex, xxxiv. 27028: "And Jehovah said
unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I
have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. And he was there with
Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink
water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten
commandments." It is known, also, which the Torah, that the first
fasting of the apostle Moses (may the peace of God be upon him) began on
Friday, which is known with us as the day *Kohleh-Ha-Ibrim* ("the
gathering of Hebrews"); for on Monday God commanded him in Ex. xix.
10-11, "And Jevovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify
them to-day and to-marrow, and let them wash their clothes. And be ready
against the third day; for the third day Jovovah will come down in the
sight of all the people upon Mount Sinai." The third day would be
Wednesday, which is with us the Pentecost day, and on that day the
righteous God (may he be praised) uttered the ten commandments, which
day became with them a great day, whose importance has kept well known
until our days. It is named "the Day of Mekratah." On the selfsame day
Moses pronounced, in the hearing of the people, the ten commandments, as
stated in Ex. xix. 25: "So Moses went down unto the people, and spoke
unto them." He gave them an exposition of God's statues and what God had
addressed to him, for we read in Exodus, "Thus shalt thou say to the
house of Jacob and announce to the children of Israel"; and we read
also: "And Moses came and explained to the people all the commandments
of the Lord and his statues." He also did what is given in Ex. xxiv. 4:
"And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the
morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars,
according to the twelve tribes of Israel." And that morning was the
morning of the fifth day, which was Thursday, as mentioned by the
learned doctor Sadakah in his exposition book. On that day they offered
sacrifices upon the altar, and what Moses has written of the commands of
God was read to them.

 

VIII\. THE WRITING OF THE COMMANDMENTS.

We have been asked, What was the use of writing the commandments of God
and reading them to the people after the people had been addressed
directly with them, and after they had answered, "All the words which
Jehovah hath said will we do" (Ex. xxiv. 3)?

The answer is like this: A man will agree with another upon some thing.
He writes first the agreement and reads it to him. The second party
agrees or disagrees to the agreement, and that is why the people
answered, "We will do," in Hebrew, *Nesheh*. They said the second time,
"We shall obey and do," equivalent to *Nechmoa Unecheh* in Hebrew. And
when the young man of Israel had killed the offering of oxen upon the
altar which the apostle had built, the latter took the blood, and put
half of it in basins, and the other half he sprinkled on the altar; but
the half which was kept in the basin he sprinkled over the children of
Israel. Thus the blood fell upon their clothing and the ten commandments
*Eshret Hadebarim* were inscribed upon the people according as they were
heard from the mouth of the Almighty God, who made a covenant with them,
according to Ex. xxiv. 8: "And he said, Behold the blood of the covenant
which Jehovah has made with you concerning all these words." In another
place, namely, Ex. xxxiv. 27, we read: "According to the tenor of these
words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel." This covenant
was made with them, that they might not commit any transgression in the
commandments of the High God (whose name is exalted). It is the fourth
commandment of the seven which God had made with the children of Israel.
*And God knows best, and to him belongs the best wisdom.*

Now, after the fulfillment of all these things, God said, in Ex. xxiv.
12: *Elah, Elai Haharah*, namely, "Come up to me to the mountain." This,
therefore, according to the revelation, was on Friday, upon which his
first fastings took place. On the morning of the forty-first day he
descended the mountain, and found what the people had done in reference
to the calf, and took the same, and burned it on that very day. It is
well known what he did on that day. On the following morning he returned
to the mountain to intercede for the people and for their
transgressions, as we have already stated. He remained there fasting for
forty days, and on the fulfillment of the forty days he descended, and
hewed out the two tablets on the day of his descent. On the morning he
returned and ascended the mountain, to obtain the writing upon the
second two tablets. Compare Ex. xxxiv. 2: "And be ready by the morning,
and come up by the morning to Mount Sinai." Thus the whole period
previous to this amounted to eighty-two days. After he had fasted
another forty days, the period totaled one hundred and twenty-two days,
the period totaled one hundred and twenty-two days plus the day on which
he descended. Now, as four days had proceeded, namely, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday, and as doubtless one day or two were omitted
from one month, the descent of the apostle Moses (upon whom may be the
best peace), after the end of the third forty days, was, in all
probability, on the morning of the ninth day of the seventh month, that
is, on the day known with us as *Teshet Iomey Hateshobah*, that is, "the
nine days of repentance."

On that day Moses commanded the people to fast on the tenth of the
seventh month, known with them as "the day of the great atonement," in
Hebrew *Iom Hakeforim*. This is in accordance with what our learned
doctor of blessed memory, Sadakah, has said. This account would be true
if the third month had fallen on Monday. If it had fallen on the
Sabbath, then the omission of only one day in the four months we have
mentioned could have taken place, for it is impossible that four months
should occur without the omission of a single day, as our learned men
claim that the new moon of the first month which the Passover was
celebrated in Egypt took place on Thursday. This is quite proved. Thus,
following in the least these accounts, we would think that one month in
these six months had been omitted; and it is said that the six days
which are mentioned in Ex. xxiv. 16, "And a cloud covered it for six
days," were included in the fasting of the apostle Moses in his first
fasting. *And God has the best knowledge of all these things.*

This is what my tired understanding and weak mind have been able to
record concerning this question, and I pray God for forgiveness if any
addition or subtraction has been made.

 

 

 

 

(SEE PART 2 FOR THE REMAINER OF THE BOOK.)

  

\[1\] The names Moses, Abraham, etc., are uniformly followed by an
inscription similar to this; and all references to God by such
ejaculations as "May He be exalted."

\[2\] The High Priest writes the name Jehovah, as in un-pointed Hebrew,
IHWH.

\[3\] There is reason to agree with the High Priest in this opinion.

\[4\] This date (1753 A.D.) appears to be an error; for the following
passages appear to indicate that the heretic is still living.
