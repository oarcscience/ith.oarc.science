# CHAPTER XXII.

REGULATIONS CONCERNING PREPARATION OF FOOD AND BEVERAGES.

MISHNA: Should a cask break open, sufficient may be saved for three
meals. The owner may also call to others: "Come and save for yourselves
(whatever you can)." No portion of the leakage, however, may be sponged
up (soaked up with a sponge). One must not press fruit in order to
extract the juice; and if it ooze out by itself, it must not be used. R.
Jehudah said: "If the fruit is for eating, the juice which oozes out may
be used; but if it is for beverage, it must not be used. If honeycombs
be broken on the eve of Sabbath and the honey ooze out, the honey must
not be used." R. Eliezer, however, permits this.

GEMARA: We have learned, that wine must not be soaked up with a sponge,
and oil must not be dipped with a spoon, in the same manner as it is
done on week-days (there must be a slight change).

The rabbis taught: If fruit becomes scattered in a courtyard (private
ground) it may be gathered up and eaten, but this must not be done as on
a week-day; *i.e.*, gathered in a basket.

"*One must not press fruit*," etc. Said R. Jehudah in the name of
Samuel: "R. Jehudah (of the Mishna) agrees with the sages in the case of
olives and grapes." Why so? Because this class of fruit is intended only
for pressing, and the juice which must of a necessity ooze out might be
calculated upon by the owner for a beverage. Ula said, that R. Jehudah
differed with the sages even in the case of olives and grapes. R.
Johanan said, that the Halakha prevails according to R. Jehudah as far
as other fruit is concerned, but not as regards olives and grapes.

Said R. Aba in the name of R. Jehudah, quoting Samuel: "R. Jehudah
subsequently agreed with the sages as regards olives and grapes, and the
sages also agreed with him later concerning other fruit." Said R.
Jeremiah to R. Aba: "Wherein *do* they differ?" and R. Aba answered: "Go
and seek, and thou wilt find it!" Said R. Na'hman bar Itz'hak: "It seems
to me

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

that they differ concerning berries and pomegranates, for we have
learned in a Boraitha: The juice of olives or grapes, which after having
been pressed and brought into the house had oozed out by itself, must
not be used, whether the fruit had been brought in for eating or
beverage. If a man squeezed out the juice of berries and pomegranates
and brought the pressed fruit into the house to eat, if any more juice
oozed out, he might drink it; but if he brought the fruit expressly for
eating purposes or for beverage, or without any express design, he must
not drink the juice that had oozed out, so said R. Jehudah. The sages,
however, prohibit the use of the juice under any circumstances."

Said R. Jehudah in the name of Samuel: "A man may squeeze out a bunch of
grapes directly into a pot, but not into a bowl. (Why not? Because if he
squeezed it into the pot it is proof positive that it will be used for
food, but if squeezed into the bowl it might be used as a beverage.)
Said R. Hisda: "From the decree of our master we can learn, that a man
may milk a goat right into the pot, but not into a bowl." Thus we see
that Samuel holds, that beverages when mixed with eatables are also
regarded as eatables.

Said R. Zera in the name of R. Hyya bar Ashi, quoting Rabh: "A bunch of
grapes must be squeezed directly into the pot, but not into a bowl, but
the oil of fish may be pressed out even into a bowl." R. Dimi repeated
this decree. Said Abayi to him: "Ye teach this in the name of Rabh,
hence ye have no objection; but we learn this in the name of Samuel,
hence we have the following objection: 'Can Samuel say that the oil of a
fish may be squeezed out even in a bowl? Were we not taught, that if a
man squeezed out herbs which were soaked in wine and vinegar, it is,
according to Rabh, permitted to commence with, if the herbs were to be
eaten; but if the juice only was to be used, the man would not be liable
for a sin-offering, but he should not do it to start with? If the herbs,
however, were cooked, whether the man wished to eat them or only use the
juice, he might squeeze them out into a bowl. Samuel, however, decreed,
that be the herbs cooked or raw, one may do this only if he intends to
eat the herbs, but not if he only intends to use the juice; if he does,
however, he is not liable for a sin-offering.'"

R. Dimi answered: "By the Lord! My eyes have seen it, and not as a
stranger, that I heard this decree from R. Jeremiah,

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

he from R. Zera, he again from R. Hyya bar Ashi, and the latter from
Rabh's mouth."

In regard to the quoted Boraitha concerning the herbs that one had
squeezed out (we have heard the opinion of Rabh and Samuel), R. Johanan
said: "Be they cooked or raw herbs, he may do so to commence with, if he
intends to eat the herbs; but if he only desires the juice he must not
do so, and if he does he is liable for a sin-offering." All this
however, is opposed by the following Boraitha: One may squeeze out herbs
which were soaked in wine and vinegar on the Sabbath for use on the same
day, but not for later use; but one must not press olives or grapes, and
if he does, he is liable for a sin-offering." Now, this is in opposition
to all three: Rabh, Samuel, and R. Johanan. Rabh could explain this in
accordance with his teaching; viz.: The herbs may be pressed on the
Sabbath, for use on that day and not later, providing he uses the herbs
for eating; but if he wishes to use the juice he must not do so, but if
he does he is not liable for a sin-offering; and cooked herbs he may
squeeze out, whether he requires the herbs or the juice, olives and
grapes he should not press: if he does, he is liable for a sin-offering.
Samuel could explain it according to his own opinion: A man may squeeze
out herbs on Sabbath for that same day, but not for later use; and the
same law applies to cooked herbs, provided they are used for eating, but
if the juice is wanted they must not be pressed, etc. R. Johanan could
explain the Boraitha in accordance with his teaching, as follows: Be the
herbs cooked or soaked, they may be squeezed out if intended for eating;
but if the juice is required he must not, and if he did so it is equal
to pressing olives or grapes, and he is liable for a sin-offering.

Said R. Hyya bar Ashi in the name of Rabh: "According to biblical law
one cannot be culpable except for pressing olives and grapes. So have
taught the disciples of Menasseh. Also according to biblical law, a
witness that testifies from hearsay must not be accredited, with the
exception of a case where he testifies to having heard that a woman's
husband had died."

"*If honeycombs be broken on the eve of Sabbath*." When R. Hosea came
from Neherdai he brought a new Boraitha; viz.: "If olives and grapes
were crushed before the Sabbath, and the juice oozed out, it must not be
drunk; but R. Eliezer and R. Simeon both permit it." Said R. Joseph: "He
just tells us of another man in addition to R. Eliezer!" Said Abayi to
him:

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "He taught us a
great deal; for from our Mishna I would say, that honeycombs were
eatables before being crushed and also afterwards; therefore R. Eliezer
permits the use of the honey, but in the case of olives and grapes which
were previously eatables and subsequently became beverages, it might be
presumed that even R. Eliezer would not permit their use. Hence we were
instructed by R. Hosea to the contrary."

MISHNA: Whatever has been dressed with hot water on the eve of Sabbath,
may be soaked in hot water on the Sabbath; and whatever has not been
dressed with hot water on the eve of Sabbath, must only be passed
through hot water on the Sabbath: excepting only stale salt fish and
Spanish kolias (a kind of fish which was generally cured to make it
eatable), for passing these through hot water is all the dressing
required for them.

GEMARA: What does the Mishna refer to? For instance, the hen of R. Aba!
He would cook a hen, then soak it in water, and when it would fall to
pieces he would eat it. Said R. Safra: "I was there at one time and R.
Aba served me with some of that dish, and had he not given
three-year-old wine immediately after it, I would have been forced to
vomit."

R. Johanan would spit every time be was reminded of Babylonian Kutach (a
dish made of small salt fish boiled in milk). Said R. Joseph: "Yea, and
let us spit when we think of R. Aba's hen." And R. Gaza said: "I was in
Palestine at one time, and made that same dish (kutach); so they begged
me to give them some for all the sick in Palestine."

"*And whatever has not been dressed with hot water*," etc. What is the
law concerning one who had passed kolias or stale salt fish through hot
water? Said R. Joseph: "He is liable for a sin-offering." Said Mar the
son of Rabhina: "We have understood it so from the Mishna, because the
last clause is 'for passing these through hot water is all the dressing
required for them,' and the finishing of a certain kind of labor is
equivalent to hammering.

R. Hyya bar Aba and R. Assi once sat in the presence of R. Johanan, and
R. Johanan dozed off. So R. Hyya bar Aba asked R. Assi why the fowls of
Babylon were so fat. R. Assi answered: "Go to the desert of Aza in
Palestine, and I will show thee fatter ones." "Why are the Babylonians
so merry during the festivals?," asked R. Hyya again. "Because they are
poor (and during the entire year they have no pleasures, so they take

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

advantage of the festivals)," was the answer. "Why are the scholars of
Babylon so well dressed?" queried R. Hyya. "Because they are ignorami"
(and must wear good clothes in order to command respect), answered R.
Assi. At that moment R. Johanan awoke, and said to them: "Youngsters!
Did I not tell you, that it is written \[Proverbs vii. 4\]: 'Say unto
wisdom, Thou art my sister,' which means: If a thing is as certain to
thee as the fact that thou canst not marry thy own sister, then say it?
Otherwise, thou shalt not say it. (Then why speak such foolishness?)"
Then said they: "Let Master tell some things (which would benefit us)!"
Said R. Johanan: "The fowls of Babylon are fat because they were never
driven away from home, as it is written \[Jeremiah xlviii. 11\]: 'Moab
was ever at ease from his youth, and he was resting on his lees, and was
not emptied from vessel to vessel, and had not gone into exile:
therefore had his taste remained in him and his scent was not changed.'
Whence do we know that the fowls of Palestine were driven from home? It
is written \[ibid. ix. 9\]: 'Both the fowls of the heavens and the
beasts are fled; they are gone away.'--\[R. Jacob said in the name of R.
Johanan, that the fowls and the beasts and all else came back to
Palestine with the exception of the Spanish kolias (the reason will be
explained in Tract Bechorath.\]--'Why are the Babylonians merry during
the festivals?' Because they were not included in the curse of \[Hosea
ii. 13\]: 'And I will cause to cease all her mirth, her festival, her
new moon, and her Sabbath, and all her appointed feasts.'"

Said R. Itz'hak: "(Indeed it was so.) There was not a single feast in
Palestine, that the military did not come to Sephoris"; and R. Hanina
said: "There was not a single feast in Palestine, that captains, guards,
and supervisors did not come to Tiberias."--"Why are the scholars of
Babylon so well dressed?" "Because they are all strangers. As the saying
goes: In a city where a man is known, he may wear whatever he chooses;
but where he is not sufficiently known he should dress well."

R. Joseph taught: It is written \[Isaiah xxvii. 6\]: "In the future
shall Jacob yet take root: Israel shall bud and blossom; and shall fill
the face of the world with fruit." What is meant by "bud and blossom"?
The scholars of Babylon, who wind blossoms and wreaths around the
Thorah.

MISHNA: A man may break open a cask, to eat dry figs therefrom;
provided, he does not intend using the cask afterwards

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

as a vessel. He must not pierce the bunghole of a cask, such is the
decree of R. Jehudah (or R. Jose); the sages permit this to be done. And
one must not bore a hole in the side of it; but if it was already
perforated, he must not fill it up with wax, because he would smoothen
the wax thereby. Said R. Jehudah: "Such a case was brought before R.
Johanan ben Sachai, at Arab, and he observed: 'I doubt whether that act
does not involve liability to bring a sin-offering.'"

GEMARA: Said R. Oshea: "When may a man hold a dirk to open a cask of
figs? If the figs are very tightly packed, for then he would have to use
a knife or a dirk to get the figs out; but if they were packed loose he
must not use a knife to open the cask."

An objection was raised: We have learned, that R. Simeon ben Gamaliel
said: "A man may bring in a cask of wine, cut off the bung-head with a
knife, and serve it to the guests with impunity." This Boraitha is in
accordance with the opinion of the sages, while our Mishna is in
accordance with the decree of R. Nehemiah (who holds that no vessel may
be used for any other purpose but that for which it was originally
intended). What impelled R. Oshea to make the entire Mishna conform with
the dictum of R. Nehemiah? Let him say, that the cask may be opened with
a knife even if the figs are loose, and thus be in accord with the
sages? Answered Rabha: "The reason is, that R. Oshea could not quite
comprehend why the Mishna specified figs: it could have said fruit, and
on that account he reasoned as stated."

In one Boraitha we have learned: Palm-leaf baskets containing dried figs
and dates may be untied, taken apart, or cut; and in another Boraitha we
were taught, that they may be untied, but not taken apart or tied. This
presents no difficulty; for one Boraitha is in accordance with the
opinion of the sages, and the other is in accord with R. Nehemiah.

A question was asked of R. Shesheth: "May a cask be bored with an auger
on the Sabbath? Shall we assume, that one intended to make an opening in
the cask and hence it is prohibited, or that he intended merely to make
a larger space for the flow of the wine and it is therefore permitted?"
The answer was: "The intention was to make an opening, and it is
prohibited." An objection based upon the teaching of R. Simeon ben
Gamaliel [previously](errata.htm#15.md) mentioned was raised, and the
answer was: "There the intention certainly was to make the space

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

larger, while here it is obvious that the intention was to make an
opening; otherwise, he would have broken open the cask with a knife."

"*One must not pierce the bunghole of a cask*." Said R. Huna: "They
differ only in reference to the top of a bunghole of a cask; but as for
the side, all agree that it is not allowed, and this is carried out by
the later clause in the Mishna; viz.: 'And he must not bore a hole in
the side of it.'" R. Hisda, however, said: "They differ only as far as
boring a hole in the side of the bunghole is concerned, but as for the
top, all agree that it is permitted; and the later clause of the Mishna
means to state that one must not bore a hole in the side of the cask
itself."

The rabbis taught: One must not bore a new hole on Sabbath, but if it
was already made he may enlarge it; and others say, that he must not
enlarge it; but all agree, that if the hole was merely stopped it may be
reopened. The first Tana prohibits the boring of a new hole, because
thereby an opening is made. Does not enlarging a hole improve the
opening? Said Rabba: According to biblical law, an opening through which
one cannot enter or go out is not considered a door, but the rabbis made
this a precaution on account of chicken-coops, the holes of which are
made for the purpose of admitting fresh air and emitting the foul.
(Therefore making a hole in a coop is equivalent to making a whole coop,
for without holes it is of no value.) Enlarging a hole, however, is
permitted, because one would enlarge a hole in a chicken-coop, lest an
ichneumon should enter and kill a chicken. Why do some say, then, that
holes should not even be enlarged? Because it might be that one did
*not* make the hole in a chicken-coop large enough, and *would* enlarge
it. R. Na'hman taught in the name of R. Johanan, that the Halakha
remains according to the last dictum.

All agree, that a hole which had been stopped up may be reopened. Said
R. Jehudah in the name of Samuel: This was said only in the case of
where a hole had been stopped to preserve the aroma of the wine. If,
however, the hole was stopped up in order to strengthen the cask, it
must not be reopened. What is meant by preserving the aroma and by
strengthening the cask? Said R. Hisda: "If the hole was on top of the
cask and was stopped up, it was for the purpose of preserving the aroma;
but if at the bottom, it was for the purpose of strengthening the cask."
Rabha said: "If it was at the bottom, it was also only for the purpose
of preserving the aroma; and only if

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

the hole was stopped up right underneath the lees of the wine, it was
for the purpose of strengthening the cask."

Rabh prohibits the inserting of a faucet into a cask, and Samuel permits
it. All agree, that cutting a hole in the cask for the purpose Of
inserting a faucet is prohibited, and that replacing the faucet, if once
removed, is permitted. They differ, however, only when a hole had
already been made in the cask before the Sabbath, but it was not quite
fit for the faucet. Those who say, that it is prohibited, do so as a
precaution lest one cut a fresh hole, while those that permit this to be
done say no precautionary measure is necessary.

This is like the following difference between Tanaim: We have learned
that a screw must not be fitted on a festival, much less on a Sabbath;
but if it fall out it may be replaced on Sabbath, and so much more on a
festival; and R. Yashia makes the ordinance more lenient. What does R.
Yashia make more lenient? Shall we assume, that he refers to the first
part and permits a screw to be cut? In that event, he would be improving
a vessel, and that is certainly not allowed! Shall we assume, on the
other hand, that he refers to the second part; the first Tana alone
permits this? We must say, therefore, that the screw was already cut,
but did not quite fit, and he permits the fitting of it. (Hence the same
difference exists here as between the previous Tanaim.) R. Shesheth the
son of R. Idi in the name of R. Johanan said: "The Halakha prevails
according to R. Yashia."

"*But if it was already perforated*," etc. To fill it up with oil is,
according to Rabh, prohibited, as a precaution lest he fill it with wax;
and according to Samuel it is permitted, as the latter does not deem a
precautionary measure necessary. Said R. Samuel bar bar Hana to R.
Joseph: "Thou hast said distinctly in the name of Rabh, that oil is
permitted." Answered R. Joseph: "Thou hast caught me in a trap." <span
id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_173.md)

Said Samuel: "The leaf of myrtle must not be put in the bunghole of a
cask, so that the wine flow over it." Why so? R. Yimar of Diphti said:
"As a precaution lest a groove (channel) be made." R. Ashi said: "As a
precaution lest the leaf be broken off (from its stem)." What difference
is there? The difference is in the case of a leaf that had already been
broken off (from its stem). (The precautionary measure of R. Yimar
remains, while that of R. Ashi falls to the ground of itself.)

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

Is it permitted to wrap one's self in a bolster in public ground and
bring it into private ground? Rabh prohibits this and Samuel permits it.
If the bolster were soft and could be folded, they do not differ, all
agreeing that it is permitted. If it were hard and could not be folded,
all agree that it is prohibited. They differ only concerning a bolster
that was neither soft nor hard, but a medium between the two. One says,
that it appears like a burden and should not be carried, while the other
holds that it is not a burden and may be carried; and the opinion just
ascribed to Rabh was not stated by him expressly, but was merely
inferred from the following incident: "Rabh came to a certain place and
found that he lacked room; so he went out into a lane (unclaimed
ground), and when a bolster was brought to him he would not sit down on
it. Those who saw this inferred therefore that he did not hold it to be
permissible." As a matter of fact, this was not so. Rabh had it
proclaimed that a bolster was allowed to be used, but in honor of the
masters who were with him he would not sit down on that bolster. Who
were those masters? R. Kahana and R. Assi.

MISHNA: One may put cooked victuals into a cave (or cellar) for the
purpose of preserving them; also put clean water (contained in a vessel)
into water that is not drinkable, in order to keep it (the former) cool;
likewise cold water (in a vessel) into hot water, in order to warm the
former. One whose clothes have dropped into the water while on the road,
may unhesitatingly go on with them. As soon as he arrives at the outmost
court (of the city or village), he may spread his clothes in the sun to
dry, but he must not do this publicly.

GEMARA: Is this not self-evident? One might say, that there should be a
precaution against grading (smoothening) any incavations that might be
in the cave; hence we are told that such is not the case.

"*Clean water into water that is not drinkable*," etc. Is this not
self-evident? Yea; but this is taught on account of the later clause in
the Mishna, *i.e.*, putting cold water into hot. Is this also not
self-evident? One might say, that this should be prohibited, as a
precaution lest one also put a vessel containing cold water into glowing
cinders to warm; so we are told, that such a precaution is not
necessary.

"*One whose clothes have dropped into the water*," etc. Said R. Jehudah
in the name of Rabh: "All things which were forbidden on account of
causing suspicion among the people (that

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

one is committing a wrongful act) should not be done, not only publicly,
but even in the innermost recesses of one's rooms." Is this not
contradictory to our Mishna, which says, that one may spread his clothes
in the sun, but *not publicly*? This is a difference between Tanaim, for
in reference to this Mishna we have learned in a Boraitha, that both R.
Eliezer and R. Simeon hold, that it is prohibited even when not done
publicly.

Said R. Huna: "He who dusts his clothes on a Sabbath is liable for a
sin-offering. This refers only, however, to a new garment, but not to an
old one, and the new garment only when it is black; but garments of
other colors *may* be dusted. Referring to a black garment, it is only
then prohibited to be dusted if its possessor is particular about it (to
such a degree, that he never puts it on without dusting it)."

Ula once came to Pumbaditha and he saw the rabbis dusting their clothes
on a Sabbath, so he said: "The rabbis are violating, the Sabbath!" So R.
Jehudah said to his disciples: "Dust your clothes right before his eyes:
we are not particular."

Abayi stood before R. Joseph. R. Joseph said to him: "Give me my hat."
And seeing that the hat was very dusty, Abayi hesitated to give it to
him. So R. Joseph said: "Take hold of it and dust it: we are not
particular."

We have learned in a Boraitha: Those who deal in clothes, and carry them
folded on their shoulders on Sabbath, are liable for a sin-offering:
this refers not only to clothes-dealers, but also to others;
clothes-dealers, however, are mentioned, because that is their usual
custom. The same is the case with a merchant who carries out a bag of
money. He is liable for a sin-offering; and not only a merchant, but
also others; but merchants are mentioned because it is their wont to
carry money in that manner.

Said R. Jehudah: "It once happened that Hyrcanos the son of R. Eliezer
ben Hyrcanos went out on Sabbath with a kerchief folded on his shoulder
and tied to one of his fingers with a piece of twine (in order that it
might not fall down); and when the sages heard this, they said that the
twine was unnecessary, for he could have carried the kerchief without
it."

It happened that Ula came to the house of Assi bar Him, and he was asked
whether it was allowed to make a groove of the clothes on Sabbath. (The
Babylonians wore long garments, and by turning them up at the bottom a
quasi-groove was made.) Ula answered: "So said R. Ilai: It is prohibited
to make a

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

groove on Sabbath." What is a groove? Said R. Zera: "A groove made of
the clothes of the Babylonians." Said R. Papa: "Bear this rule in mind:
If the clothes are turned up for the purpose of preventing their
becoming soiled, it is prohibited; but if they are turned up to improve
their appearance, it is allowed, as R. Shesha the son of R. Idi would
always arrange his cloak (toga) tastefully (on a week-day, hence it is
customary and may also be done on Sabbath)."

When R. Dimi came from Palestine, he related: It once happened that
Rabbi went out into the field, and both ends of his toga hung on his
shoulders. Said Jehoshua the son of Ziruz, the son of R. Meir's
father-in-law before Rabbi: "Did not R. Meir say, that in a case of this
kind one is liable for a sin-offering?" Said Rabbi: "Was R. Meir so
particular, that he determined just how far down the ends of one's toga
should reach?" Still he (Rabbi) let down his toga; and when Rabhin came
from Palestine he said, that it was not Jehoshua ben Ziruz who made that
remark, but Jehoshua ben Bepusai the son-in-law of R. Aqiba; and not
that R. Meir said what has just been cited, but that R. Aqiba had said
that. Also, that Rabbi had inquired whether R. Aqiba was so particular;
and lastly, that Rabbi let down his toga. When R. Samuel ben R. Jehudah
came from Palestine he said, that Rabbi was only asked concerning such a
case (but not that he himself was the party referred to).

MISHNA: One who bathes in the water of a cavern or in the hot springs of
Tiberias, though he wipe himself with ten towels, must not carry them
off in his hand; but if ten persons wiped themselves, their faces, their
hands, and their feet, with one towel, they might carry it off in their
hands.

One may anoint and rub the stomach with the bands, but not so as to
cause fatigue. One must not brush the body with a flesh-brush or descend
into a kurdima. <span id="fr_174"></span>[1](#fn_174.md) One must not take
an emetic, or stretch the limbs of an infant, or put back a rupture; one
who has strained his hand or foot must not pour cold water on it, but he
may wash it in the usual way: if he thereby becomes cured, it is Well.

GEMARA: The Mishna teaches, "the water of a cavern," in connection with
the hot springs of Tiberias; hence it must be, that the water of a
cavern is also hot. And again it says, "one

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

who bathes," and not "one may bathe," from which we see, that to
commence with, bathing in those waters is not allowed; but merely to
rinse one's self is permitted, even to commence with. This is according
to the opinion of R. Simeon.

"*Though he wipe himself with ten towels*," etc. The first part of this
clause in the Mishna imparts something new and unexpected in that it
teaches, that, although if one man wipe himself with ten towels, there
will be very little water contained in the towels, still he might
through thoughtlessness wring them; and the latter part of the clause
also imparts something new and unexpected, stating, as it does, that if
ten men wipe themselves with one towel, although the towel will contain
a great deal of water, they will mutually remind each other that it must
not be wrung.

The rabbis taught: "A man may wipe himself with a towel and leave it at
the window of a house that is nearest to the wall of the bathhouse; but
he must not give it to the bathhouse employees, because they are
suspected of wringing it on the Sabbath." R. Simeon, however, says: "A
man may wipe himself with one towel and carry it in his hand to his
house." Said Abayi to R. Joseph: "How is the law?" and he answered: "Did
not R. Hyya bar Aba in the name of R. Johanan say, that the law prevails
according to R. Simeon?" Did R. Johanan say this indeed? Did he not say
elsewhere, that the Halakha prevails according to the anonymous teachers
in the Mishna, and the Mishna teaches, that even if one man wiped
himself with ten towels he must not carry them off in his hand? R.
Johanan teaches, that the Mishna concludes with, "So said the son of
Hakhinai." (hence it is the teaching of one individual).

R. Hyya bar Aba in the name of R. Johanan said: "The bathhouse employees
may carry the sheets with which the women wipe themselves in the
bathhouse on the street by wrapping them around their bodies; provided
they wrap them over their heads and the greater part of their body."

R. Hyya bar Aba said in the name of R. Johanan: "A large veil which is
worn by women should have the two ends that hang down in the back tied."
And he said again, that they should be tied underneath the shoulders.

Rabha said to the inhabitants of Mehuzza: "If ye must carry clothes for
the military on Sabbath, wrap them around you underneath the shoulders."

"*One may anoint and rub his stomach*." The rabbis taught:

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "The stomach may
be rubbed and anointed on the Sabbath, provided it is not done the same
as on week-days." How should it be done? R. Hama bar Hanina said: "He
should first anoint it and then rub it"; but R. Johanan said, that he
might do both at the same time.

"*But so as not to cause fatigue*," etc. Said R. Hyya bar Aba in the
name of R. Johanan: "It is not allowed to stand on the bed of Lake
Deumseth, because the loam at the bottom is saline and immersion in the
lake causes fatigue." Said R. Jehudah in the name of Rabh: "The days on
which a cure in that lake (for bodily ills) may be effected are only
twenty-one, and Pentecost occurs during those twenty-one days." The
school-men asked: "Does Pentecost fall at the beginning of the
twenty-one days or at the end?" Come and hear: Samuel said, that all
waters taken for a cure are effective only from Passover to Pentecost.
As for waters taken internally, Samuel may be right (because during cool
weather one takes more exercise and thus the waters are effective), but
for bathing it would seem that Pentecost should be the commencement.

Said R. Helbo: "The wine of the land of Purgaitha and the waters of the
lake Deumseth robbed Israel of ten tribes (because indulgence in these
pleasures are detrimental to spiritual welfare)." R. Elazar ben Aroch
happened to be there, and indulged in those luxuries to such an extent
that he forgot his learning, and afterwards the sages had to pray for
his return unto the Law. This is as we have learned elsewhere (Aboth):
R. Nehurai said: "Go into exile only in a place of learning and think
not that the Law will follow thee, or that thy comrades will preserve it
in thy hands, and do not depend upon thy acquired knowledge." This R.
Nehurai is, according to some, the same Elazar ben Aroch, and he was
called Nehurai, because this signifies (in Hebrew) "light of the eyes";
for he enlightened the eyes of many scholars with his interpretations.

"*One must not brush the body*," etc. The rabbis taught: One must not
brush the body with a flesh-brush on Sabbath. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel
said: "If one's feet were soiled, he might brush them the same as on
week-days unhesitatingly." The mother of Samuel the son of Jehudah made
her son a silver brush.

"*Or descend into a kurdima*." Why so? Because the bottom of a kurdima
is slippery (and one might fall and wet his clothes, and thus be tempted
to wring them).

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

"*One must not take an emetic*." Said Rabba bar bar Hana in the name of
R. Johanan: "One must not take a medicament as an emetic, but may thrust
his finger down his throat and thus cause vomiting."

"*Or stretch the limbs of an infant*." Said Rabba bar bar Hana in the
name of R. Johanan: "To swathe a child on Sabbath is allowed."

"*Or put back a rupture*." Said R. Hana of Bagdad in the name of Samuel:
"The Halakha prevails, that it may be done." (Samuel learns in the
Mishna, instead of "it is *not* allowed," "it *is* allowed.")

Rabba bar bar Hana once came to Pumbaditha, but did not go into the
college of R. Jehudah. So R. Jehudah sent for Ada, the officer of the
college, and said to him: "Go and take a pledge of Rabba bar bar Hana."
The officer went and did so. Afterwards Rabba bar bar Hana came to the
college. When he came he heard R. Jehudah teach, that a rupture must not
be put back on the Sabbath. Said he to him: "So said R. Hana of Bagdad
in the name of Samuel, that the Halakha prevails permitting this to be
done." Answered R. Jehudah: "It is our Hana and our Samuel. Yet we never
heard of this before. Now thou canst see that I was right in demanding a
pledge for thy appearance. Hadst thou not come, we would never have
heard this."

"*One who has strained his hand or foot*," etc. R. Ivia sat in the
presence of R. Joseph, and he dislocated his hand. Said he to R. Joseph,
making a motion to replace it: "May I replace it thus?" "Nay," said R.
Joseph. "And thus may I?" asked R. Ivia, making another motion. "Nay,"
was the answer again. Thus questioning, he finally succeeded in
replacing his hand. Said R. Joseph to him: "What didst thou ask me for?
It is expressly stated in our Mishna, that if one strained his hand or
his foot, he must not pour cold water on it, but he may bathe it in the
usual way. If he thereby becomes cured, it is well."

"Did we not learn in the same Mishna that a rupture must not be put
back, and still Samuel permitted it to be done?" asked R. Ivia. Answered
R. Joseph: "Canst thou weave everything into one garment? What we have
learned, we may follow; but what we have not learned, we cannot."
