# APPENDIX.

PAGE 24 of Volume I. of this tract contains a Mishna commencing with the
statement: "And these are some of the regulations enacted in the attic
of Hananiah ben Hizkyah ben Garon," and concluding, "they enforced
eighteen regulations on that day." At the same time, the Mishna fails to
enumerate in the place mentioned, or elsewhere, these eighteen
regulations. The Gemara, however, conjectures upon their character and
cites them in a scattered and incoherent manner. As a matter of course,
this is not done without the adduction of numerous and varied opinions;
but the conclusion is, that the eighteen regulations are those which we
shall enumerate farther on.

In another section of the Gemara it is related, that three hundred jars
of wine and a like number of jars of oil were taken up into that attic
in order to afford the sages no opportunity to leave their places until
their deliberations concerning the regulations were finally concluded.

Among these regulations there are, however, only two or three concerning
Sabbath, the rest being dispersed throughout the Talmud in their proper
departments and merely mentioned as regulations enacted during that
session, but they are not enumerated in regular order either of sequence
or time of enactment. Hence we, in consistency with our method of
translation--viz., to place everything in its proper department--have
omitted in this tract the enumeration of these regulations, together
with the diverse opinions concerning the reasons for their institution,
which reasons as cited by the Gemara are very abstruse and for the most
part untenable.

In the last chapter of this tract, however, mention is again made of the
eighteen regulations, and it is declared, that their measure was made
"heaping full," while elsewhere in the Gemara the assertion is made,
that the day on which they were enacted was as grave in its consequences
for Israel as the day on which the golden calf was made. It is these two
statements that have impelled us at the last moment to embody these
eighteen

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

regulations in an appendix at the end of this volume, and state as best
we can, after careful study and consideration of the subject, the most
potent reasons for their enactment.

With this purpose in view, we shall divide the eighteen regulations into
five classes, as follows: Those pertaining to Therumah
(heave-offerings), Tumah (uncleanness), Chithon (mingling with other
nations), Mikvah (legal bath), and Sabbath.

Therumah is rendered useless when brought into contact with any one of
the following ten subjects: First: With a man who eats a thing that had
been contaminated by a parent of uncleanness <span
id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_195.md) and had thus become unclean in the first
degree. Second: With a man who had eaten a thing unclean in the second
degree (*i.e.*, had been touched by a thing unclean in the first
degree). Third: With a man who had drunk unclean beverages. Fourth: With
a man who had bathed his head and the larger portion of his body in
water that had been pumped up (drawn or scooped), and not in a legal
bath. Fifth: With a clean person (*i.e.*, one who had already taken a
legal bath, but was subsequently drenched with three lugs of drawn
water). Sixth: With the sacred scrolls of the Holy Writ, either in part
or in its entire form. <span id="fr_196"></span>[2](#fn_196.md) Seventh:
With hands of which one was not quite certain that they had been kept
clean the whole day. Eighth: With one who had taken a legal bath, if the
Therumah was touched before sunset. Ninth: With eatables and utensils
which had become unclean through beverages (as will be explained in
Tract Yodaim). When brought in contact with any one of these nine
subjects, Therumah is rendered useless. Tenth: The crop raised from
Therumah (seed) is of the same character as the seed; if the latter was
clean when planted the crop is clean, but if the seed was unclean the
crop is the same. Nevertheless, it is still considered Therumah, and
subject to the

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

laws of Therumah. Thus we have ten regulations concerning Therumah.

Concerning uncleanness, there were four regulations enacted: First: All
movable things bring uncleanness on a man by means of a tent, not larger
even than a span, covering a corpse, even if the space between the
corpse and the tent was but an awl's width. (For explanation, see Tract
Ahaloth.) Second: The daughters of the Samaritans are considered unclean
(as women suffering from their menstruation) from the day of their
birth. Third: A child of a heathen is considered unclean, because it is
considered as one afflicted with venereal disease. Fourth: One who
presses grapes or olives renders the vessels used to receive the must or
the oil susceptible to uncleanness. (This is explained in detail in
Tract Kelim.)

Concerning Chithon, but one regulation was enacted, covering four
subjects: It was prohibited to partake of the bread, oil, or wine of
other nations in order to prevent intermarriage with their daughters.

Concerning Mikvah, one regulation only was enacted; viz.

If the water running out of a rain-gutter flow directly into a Mikvah,
the Mikvah is not invalidated; but if the water was intercepted by a
vessel from which it flowed into the Mikvah, the latter becomes invalid;
or even if three lugs of drawn water were poured into the Mikvah, they
render it useless (see Tract Mikvaoth).

Concerning Sabbath, two regulations were enacted: First: One shall not
search for vermin or read before lamplight (on Friday night). <span
id="fr_197"></span>[1](#fn_197.md) Second: One who was overtaken by dusk on
the Sabbath eve while on the road must give his purse to a Gentile.

The learned reader who is not familiar with the intricate teachings of
the Talmud, and even the student of the Talmud who has delved in its
labyrinths of lore for the sake of probing into the ordinances and
discussions contained in its volumes, will be quite amazed at the
seeming unimportance and triviality of the above regulations, unless
thoroughly comprehensive of the spirit of the Talmud and the object of
the sages in their day.

At the time when these regulations were enacted and enforced,

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

there appeared no reasonable grounds for their enactment; and even the
reasons advanced by the Gemara itself in a faltering, groping manner are
in many instances quite absurd. Entirely contrary to their usual custom,
the sages themselves did not base these regulations upon any inference,
analogy, passage, or ordinance contained in the Holy Writ, a very
remarkable occurrence indeed. Furthermore, at a casual glance, the
student will not find in any one of the regulations a motive based even
on common sense.

Strange to say, it has also occurred that our excellent Hebrew poet L.
Gordon, in a poem pungent with deepest sarcasm and pointed ridicule,
commented upon these eighteen regulations, saying, amongst other things:
"Not for political purposes, not for the improvement of the government
moral or material, did our sages seclude themselves in their attic, but
merely to prohibit matters as trivial and absurd as that of reading by
lamplight on the eve of Sabbath," etc.

Had the poet, however, devoted deeper study and closer research to the
environments, influences, and conditions prevailing in the days of these
sages, he would readily have discovered that the greatest political
import, the gravest questions of government both moral and material,
actuated the institution of these apparently ridiculous regulations, all
culminating and leaning towards the accomplishment of one great object;
viz., that of keeping the small nation of Jews intact and guarding it
from the dangers menacing it not only from the exterior world but from
its interior vampires and oppressors.

It should not be overlooked that when the deliberations anent these
regulations were about to be commenced, the hall used for the session
was closely guarded by men armed with keen-edged swords, under
instructions to permit all who desired to enter to do so, but to
instantly thrust their swords through any one endeavoring to retreat;
and what was the discussion commenced with? Merely an argument
determining the uncleanness of certain vessels, which the priests could
not approach (as will be seen farther on). Still, Hillel the Prince, the
mighty sage, sat before his old-time opponent Shamai, and listened to
him with the most profound attention and reverence, just as if he were
the least among his disciples.

This historical fact was but another item in inducing us to digress from
our established method and insert the eighteen regulations, together
with the explanation of their importance; for

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

had we not done so, it is highly probable that we would have called down
the criticism of many scholars who could not overlook such an omission.

At no period in the history of the Jewish race do we find so much
deliberation, profundity of thought, and depth of calculation in
evidence as at the time when the sages secluded themselves in the attic
of Hananiah ben Hizkyah. *There* it was, that means were devised to keep
the nation of the Jews--whose friends were always in the minority, and
whose enemies, not only abroad but in their very midst, were as the
sands of the sea--intact and proof against annihilation.

All of the literature current among the masses was carefully scanned and
revised. The ethical code was reënforced, and wherever necessary purged
of objectionable matter. This censorship was carried to such an extent
that it was attempted to reject even Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Ezekiel
as undesirable; and it was only with great difficulty that those in
authority were prevailed upon to let them remain. The records of
ancestry, however, tracing the descent of every existing family, which
were the pride of the people, as well as all works treating of medical
science and the art of healing, were buried and hidden beyond recovery.
Even the Apocrypha were eliminated from the Holy Writ and declared
ordinary literature, and many other writings unknown to us even in this
day, as well as all secret scripts, were thoroughly revised and made
adaptable to the existing times and circumstances. All this, and more,
was done with the sole purpose of preserving the integrity of the Jewish
race and preventing its absorption by other nations.

Thus it was commenced to accustom the Jew to study and thought, and as
an outcome of this period of virtual renaissance the eighteen
regulations were enacted with two prime objects in view, as follows:

Firstly, to diminish as far as possible the constantly growing
domination of the priests; for the high-priestdom, with which the
supreme governing power was identical, could be purchased with money,
and more especially because the number of priests in the last century
prior to the destruction of the Temple had grown to such a vast
proportion that those in actual service alone numbered little short of
twenty thousand. Apart from these were those who did not perform actual
service, while enjoying all the immunities and privileges of their rank
as priests, and they were: Priests who had the least blemish on their
bodies;

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

those whose descent or even whose wives' descent left the least room for
doubt; and the wealthy and influential priests who would not perform the
menial duties of priests, but left them to the less fortunate and more
insignificant of their number. (See "Die Priester und der Cultus," by
Dr. Adolf Büchler, Vienna, 1895.)

Of such men was the party in power composed, and they made but too free
a rise of their authority. As a matter of course, restrictions had to be
provided wherewith to relieve the oppressed.

Secondly, the object was to prevent the amalgamation of the Jews with
the other nations with whom they were in daily and constant association.

Now for the manner in which the first object was about to be
accomplished.

Quite some time previous to the time of which we are treating, the
laymen had, after a hard struggle, succeeded in divesting the priests of
their spiritual power (*i.e.*, the right to decide all questions
pertaining to religious and ritual matters, whether a thing was allowed
or forbidden, clean or unclean, etc.), by proving that the priests were
far too ignorant to be competent judges. <span
id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_198.md) This struggle had been going on since
the days of Nehemiah, for prior to his day the priests were the sole
judges both in spiritual and in temporal affairs, claiming their
privilege in accordance with the passage \[Deut. xxi. 5\]: "And after
their (the priests') decision shall be done at every controversy and
every injury." Having wrested the spiritual power from the priests, the
supervision of all religious and ritual matters was conferred upon the
Pharisees, who henceforth were the recognized authorities in the
interpretation of the Law. This accomplished, the next step decided upon
was to limit as much as possible the temporal power of the priests: it
was decided not to do this in too precipitate a manner, but cautiously
and unostentatiously, using as a medium regulations seemingly
unimportant, but the hidden motives of which were far-reaching in their
consequences.

The time of Hananiah ben Hizkyah was the more opportune for such a *coup
d'état*, as by that time the Pharisees had obtained the upper hand of
all other existing sects, notably the Sadducees.

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

Now, inasmuch as it proved to be an easy matter to enact laws by means
of which the Jews would be prevented from amalgamating with other
nations, such as the prohibition of partaking the bread, oil, etc., of
Gentiles, the proclamation declaring the children of heathens unclean
(to prevent the children of Jews from joining them at play and thus
forming attachments), and the women of the Samaritans, the deadliest
enemies of the Jews, unclean (in order to prevent their employment as
servants by Jews), it was but little more difficult to devise laws which
would forever break the oppressive domination of the priests in a mild
but nevertheless effective manner.

The first step necessary for the accomplishment of this desirable end
was to completely destroy the system of espionage practised by the
priests, and which was carried on to such an extent that spies were
constantly prying into actions and even utterances in the houses of the
laymen. This was, however, by no means an easy task, from the very fact
that the priests were virtual shareholders in all the possessions of the
laymen. One fiftieth of all grain raised by the peasants was their share
as Therumah; one tenth of such grain comprised the tithe, and one tenth
of the tithe belonged to the priests individually; the first of the
dough, the first of shorn wool, the parts of slaughtered cattle, the
firstlings of cattle, the firstfruits of trees and produce, all belonged
to the priests; and it was but natural that they were to be found in the
houses of the laymen at all times, whither they would come not to humbly
ask for their donations, but to demand it as the rightful possessors and
shareholders. Nor were they at all backward about taking a hand in the
management of all other affairs of the layman, under the plea of
guarding their own interests; and thus at times willingly, sometimes
unwillingly, they were the spies of the higher authorities of the
government.

The question then arose how to find a place where the deliberations for
the suppression of this constantly growing evil could be held without
the presence of the spying priests; and to meet the exigencies of the
case, an old decree that had been promulgated in the early days of the
existence of the Temple was again called into being and made effective.
The decree was the one enacted in the time of Jose ben Joezer Ish Izreda
and Jose ben Johanan the Jerusalemite, and read: "All the lands outside
of Judæa are unclean" (*i.e.*, all eatables and beverages containing any
degree of sanctity whatever are rendered unclean by coming

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

in contact with the soil of those lands outside of Judæa, but aside from
such eatables and beverages nothing was rendered unclean). Now, the only
eatables and beverages containing any sanctity whatever, which could be
found outside of Jerusalem, where the sacrifices and other sanctified
articles were brought, were the gifts and the Therumah set aside for the
priests. Thus we see that the declaration of uncleanness, ostensibly
directed against all eatables containing any degree of sanctity, was in
reality directed against the Therumah of the priests, while the priests
themselves were flattered by the elevation of the Therumah to the degree
of highest sanctity, and its object will be apparent from the following
argument:

The Therumah is invested with sanctity only when it is separated from
the bulk, but while still a part of the entire crop it is regarded as
ordinary grain. If the Therumah were separated from the bulk in any land
outside of Judæa, the moment it comes in contact with the soil it
becomes unclean and unfit for use. This fact made it necessary to
separate the Therumah in Judæa. The transportation of the entire crop to
Judæa for such a purpose involving too much labor and expense, part of
the crop was set aside in the field, and from that part a sufficient
quantity was separated and sent to the holy land. There the quantity of
the Therumah (which according to biblical ordinance could have been only
one grain, but according to established custom amounted to one fiftieth
of the entire crop) was separated from the quantity sent. The
consequence of this mode of procedure was, that the presence of the
priest at the place where the crop was harvested was no longer required,
as he could not demand his share outside of Judæa. Thus it was rendered
possible to hold a convocation where the presence of the priest was no
longer to be dreaded. <span id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_199.md) It seems
that up to the time of Hananiah ben Hizkyah this decree had been
evidently disregarded or not sufficiently effective, <span
id="fr_200"></span>[2](#fn_200.md) for we see that eighty years

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

prior to the destruction of the Temple it was again promulgated, and
this time reënforced with the declaration that even the atmosphere of
all lands outside of Judæa was unclean and all articles containing any
degree of sanctity were rendered unclean by contact with such
atmosphere.

The eighty years before the destruction of the Temple correspond with
the time of Hananiah ben Hizkyah, and it is quite possible that the
sages called by the Talmud "the sages of the eighty years" were the same
that took part in the deliberations in the attic, and that, in order to
secure at least one place where they could hold a convocation
undisturbed by the priests, they declared even the atmosphere of the
lands outside of Judæa unclean.

The Talmud relates, also, that in the city of Usha the decree was
reënforced for the third time with the declaration that all articles
rendered unclean by the atmosphere of such lands were not only to be
rendered useless, but were to be immediately burned, as a precaution
lest a priest might accidentally make use of them.

Still, the decree was not as effective as it should have been, as long
as the priest could come and announce that he would use his share of the
Therumah for seed or dispose of it as seed, and to meet this exigency
the sages of the attic first of all decreed that the crops raised from
clean or unclean Therumah, used as seed, were clean or unclean
respectively.

Again, means had to be devised to rid the laymen residing in Judæa
proper from the obnoxious presence of the priests at all times; for at
harvest-time, or when the grain was brought from the lands outside of
Judæa, the ever-watchful priest was on band. To this end the subsequent
regulations concerning Therumah were enacted and gradually reënforced.
Thus at first a man who had eaten a thing unclean in the first degree
rendered Therumah useless; then a man who had eaten a thing of the
second degree of uncleanness, until finally even a sacred scroll, or
even a hand that had come in contact with a sacred scroll, and last of
all a hand that was not known to be positively clean, rendered Therumah
useless. All this was done with the sole object of keeping the priests
out of the houses of the laymen, and rather bring the Therumah to them
than have them come to demand it. Should they come in spite of this, it
was not difficult to find a pretext for calling the Therumah unclean. In
order, however, not to make the purpose of these regulations

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

too apparent, and thus give offence to the priests, other regulations
were enacted in conjunction with these, which, while of no value
whatever in themselves, acted as screens for the actual intentions.

It is now not difficult to explain the historical sensation caused by
the deference shown by Hillel to Shamai at the commencement of these
deliberations, and the reasons which prompted the posting of an armed
guard at the entrance of the hall. Hillel, in his capacity as a prince
of Israel, was somewhat too timid to proceed against the priests in too
harsh a manner; but the masses were so much incensed against their
oppressors, and so deeply conscious of their grievances, that he could
not stem the popular tide against them. In this emergency it was Shamai,
under ordinary circumstances of lesser consequence than Hillel, that
proved to be the champion of the popular cause; and in order to insure
for him a telling majority when the question came up for a final vote,
the doors of the hall were guarded so that none could leave, while all
were allowed to enter. Seeing the patriotism and popularity of Shamai,
the prince could not help bowing to popular sentiment and showing
respect to the favorite of the hour.

It would require a volume of many, many pages to demonstrate how each
one of the regulations instituted was directed against the priests, how
deeply it injured them, and in what measure it curtailed their previous
unlimited sphere of action; also, especially, how the dispute between
Hillel and Shamai concerning the susceptibility to uncleanness of
vessels used at grape and olive pressing concerned the priests. Even
then, a person not thoroughly imbued with the spirit of those times
could scarcely understand it; but we would request that the eighteen
regulations be again carefully perused, and it will readily be observed
by even the casual reader, from the hints given, that the ten
ordinances <span id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_201.md) relating to Therumah
were directed entirely against the priests, and the four concerning
uncleanness were in part against the priests and in part against
mingling with other nations; as for the regulation against mingling,
that goes without saying, while the regulations concerning the Mikvah
and Sabbath were but incidental and trivial matters intended as a screen
for the grave importance of those mentioned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_195"></span>[382:1](t0138.htm#fr_195.md) By a "parent of
uncleanness" is meant any object that had come in direct contact with a
corpse. See explanation in Tract Shekalim.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[382:2](t0138.htm#fr_196.md) Why contact with the
Holy Writ should render Therumah unclean can in our opinion be explained
only as follows: When the priests came to demand their share of the
Therumah, it is highly probable that they did this with a
correspondingly impressive ceremony and read the part of the Law
referring to the Therumah before the donors. If such was really the
case, they no doubt carried the scrolls with them wherever they went,
and in consequence the regulation was enacted which rendered the
Therumah unclean when brought into contact with the scrolls or book
containing the Holy Writ. Our basis for this assertion is the ordinance
to be found in Tract Yodaim, which proclaims that the scrolls or books
containing the Holy Writ render hands unclean when coming in contact
with them, and doubtless the hands of the priests, which were afterwards
to handle Therumah, are meant.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[383:1](t0138.htm#fr_197.md) There are differences
of opinion in the Gemara as to the division of the regulations. Some
hold that they should be grouped, while others would count them
separately. The matter is of no importance, however, and hence we have
grouped them in conformity with the number stated by the Mishna.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[386:1](t0138.htm#fr_198.md) See Haggai ii. 13 and
14.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[388:1](t0138.htm#fr_199.md) At the same time that
the decree declaring all lands outside of Judæa unclean was promulgated,
glassware was also declared unclean, while prior to that time glassware
had not even been susceptible to uncleanness. We cannot state positively
whether this was done in order to render the first decree less
conspicuous or to prevent the priests from being present at the places
where glassware was manufactured, which were all outside of Judæa. Be
that as it may, it can safely be assumed that the measure was another
political ruse.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[388:2](t0138.htm#fr_200.md) It was not
sufficiently effective because, in order to circumvene the decree, the
priests brought chests to the lands outside of Judæa in which to store
the bulk of the grain before separating the Therumah, and thus prevent
the contact of the latter with the soil. This we presume from a hint of
Rashi to that effect.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[390:1](t0138.htm#fr_201.md) We have not
enumerated the ordinances in their regular order of sequence as to the
time, for they are scattered in the Talmud without any order, but
arranged them more in accordance with their importance and severity,
according to the commentary of Rashi.
