<h3>Declaration of Principles</h3> <h4>1885 Pittsburgh Conference</h4>
<hr> Convening at the call of Kaufmann Kohler of New York, Reform rabbis
from around the United States met from November 16 through November 19,
1885 with Isaac Mayer Wise presiding. The meeting was declared the
continuation of the Philadelphia Conference of 1869, which was the
continuation of the German Conference of 1841 to 1846.  The rabbis adopted
the following seminal text: 

<blockquote>1. We recognize in every religion an attempt to grasp the
Infinite, and in every mode, source or book of revelation held sacred in
any religious system the consciousness of the indwelling of God in man. We
hold that Judaism presents the highest conception of the God-idea as
taught in our Holy Scriptures and developed and spiritualized by the
Jewish teachers, in accordance with the moral and philosophical progress
of their respective ages. We maintain that Judaism preserved and defended
midst continual struggles and trials and under enforced isolation, this
God-idea as the central religious truth for the human race. 

<p>2. We recognize in the Bible the record of the consecration of the
Jewish people to its mission as the priest of the one God, and value it as
the most potent instrument of religious and moral instruction. We hold
that the modern discoveries of scientific researches in the domain of
nature and history are not antagonistic to the doctrines of Judaism, the
Bible reflecting the primitive ideas of its own age, and at times clothing
its conception of divine Providence and Justice dealing with men in
miraculous narratives. 

<p>3. We recognize in the Mosaic legislation a system of training the
Jewish people for its mission during its national life in Palestine, and
today we accept as binding only its moral laws, and maintain only such
ceremonies as elevate and sanctify our lives, but reject al such as are
not adapted to the views and habits of modern civilization. 

<p>4. We hold that all such Mosaic and rabbinical laws as regulate diet,
priestly purity, and dress originated in ages and under the influence of
ideas entirely foreign to our present mental and spiritual state.  They
fail to impress the modern Jew with a spirit of priestly holiness; their
observance in our days is apt rather to obstruct than to further modern
spiritual elevation. 

<p>5.  We recognize, in the modern era of universal culture of heart and
intellect, the approaching of the realization of Israel s great Messianic
hope for the establishment of the kingdom of truth, justice, and peace
among all men.  We consider ourselves no longer a nation, but a religious
community, and therefore expect neither a return to Palestine, nor a
sacrificial worship under the sons of Aaron, nor the restoration of any of
the laws concerning the Jewish state. 

<p>6. We recognize in Judaism a progressive religion, ever striving to be
in accord with the postulates of reason.  We are convinced of the utmost
necessity of preserving the historical identity with our great past..
Christianity and Islam, being daughter religions of Judaism, we appreciate
their providential mission, to aid in the spreading of monotheistic and
moral truth.  We acknowledge that the spirit of broad humanity of our age
is our ally in the fulfillment of our mission, and therefore we extend the
hand of fellowship to all who cooperate with us in the establishment of
the reign of truth and righteousness among men. 

<p>7. We reassert the doctrine of Judaism that the soul is immortal,
grounding the belief on the divine nature of human spirit, which forever
finds bliss in righteousness and misery in wickedness.  We reject as ideas
not rooted in Judaism, the beliefs both in bodily resurrection and in
Gehenna and Eden (Hell and Paradise) as abodes for everlasting punishment
and reward. 

<p>8. In full accordance with the spirit of the Mosaic legislation, which
strives to regulate the relations between rich and poor, we deem it our
duty to participate in the great task of modern times, to solve, on the
basis of justice and righteousness, the problems presented by the
contrasts and evils of the present organization of society.
