### THE LAST DAY OF MOSES' LIFE

On the seventh day of Adar, Moses knew that on this day he should have
to die, for a heavenly voice resounded, saying, "Take heed to thyself, O
Moses, for thou hast only one more day to live." What did Moses now do?
On this day he wrote thirteen scrolls of the Torah, twelve for the
twelve tribes, and one he put into the Holy Ark, so that, if they wished
to falsify the Torah, the one in the Ark might remain untouched. Moses
thought, "If I occupy myself with the Torah, which is the tree of life,
this day will draw to a close, and the impending doom will be as
naught." God, however, beckoned to the sun, which firmly opposed itself
to Moses, saying, "I will not set, so long as Moses lives." When Moses
had completed writing the scrolls of the Torah, not even half the day
was over. He then bade the tribes come to him, and from his hand receive
the scrolls of the Torah, admonishing the men and women separately to
obey the Torah and its commands. The most excellent among the thirteen
scrolls was fetched by Gabriel, who brought it to the highest heavenly
court to show the piety of Moses, who had fulfilled all that is written
in the Torah. Gabriel passed with it through all the heavens, so that
all might witness Moses' piety. It is this scroll of the Torah out of
which the souls of the pious read on Monday and Thursday, as well as on
the Sabbath and holy days.

Moses on this day showed great honor and distinction to his disciple
Joshua in the sight of all Israel. A herald passed before Joshua through
all the camp, proclaiming, "Come and hear the words of the new prophet
that hath arisen for us to-day!" All Israel approached to honor Joshua.
Moses then gave the command to fetch hither a golden throne, a crown of
pearls, a royal helmet, and a robe of purple. He himself set up the rows
of benches for the Sanhedrin, for the heads of the army, and for the
priests. Then Moses betook himself to Joshua, dressed him, put the crown
on his head, and bade him be seated upon the golden throne to deliver
from it a speech to the people. Joshua then spoke the following words
which he first whispered to Caleb, who then announced it in a loud voice
to the people. He said: "Awaken, rejoice, heavens of heavens, ye above;
sound joyously, foundations of earth, ye below. Awaken and proclaim
aloud, ye orders of creation; awaken and sing, ye mountains everlasting.
Exult and shout in joy, ye hills of earth, awaken and burst into songs
of triumph, ye hosts of heaven. Sing and relate, ye tents of Jacob,
sing, ye dwelling place of Israel. Sing and hearken to all the words
that come from your King, incline you heart to all His words, and gladly
take upon yourselves and your souls the commandments of your God. Open
your mouth, let your tongue speak, and give honor to the Lord that is
your Helper, give thanks to your Lord and put your trust in Him. For He
is One, and hath no second, there is none like Him among the gods, not
one among the angels is like Him, and beside Him is there none that is
your Lord. To His praise there are no bounds; to His fame no limit, no
end; to His miracles no fathoming; to His works no number. He kept the
oath that He swore to the Patriarchs, through our teacher Moses. He
fulfilled the covenant with them, and the love and the vow He had made
them, for He delivered us through many miracles, led us from bondage to
freedom, clove for us the sea, and bestowed upon us six hundred and
thirteen commandments."

When Joshua had completed his discourse, a voice resounded from heaven,
and said to Moses, "Thou hast only five hours more of life." Moses
called out to Joshua, "Stay seated like a king before the people!" Then
both began to speak before all Israel; Moses read out the text and
Joshua expounded. There was no difference of opinion between them, and
the words of the two matched like the pearls in a royal crown. But
Moses' countenance shone like the sun, and Joshua's like the moon.

While Joshua and all Israel still sat before Moses, a voice from heaven
became audible and said, "Moses, thou hast now only four hours of life."
Now Moses began to implore God anew: "O Lord of the world! If I must die
only for my disciple's sake, consider that I am willing to conduct
myself as if I were his pupil; let it be as if he were high priest, and
I a common priest; he is king, and I his servant." God replied: "I have
sworn by My great name, which ' the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot
contain,' that thou shalt not cross the Jordan." Moses: "Lord of the
world! Let me at least, by the power of the Ineffable Name, fly like a
bird in the air; or make me like a fish transform my two arms to fins
and my hair to scales, that like a fish I may leap over the Jordan and
see the land of Israel." God: "If I comply with thy wish, I shall break
My vow." Moses: "Lord of the world! Lead me upon the pinions of the
clouds about three parasangs high beyond the Jordan, so that the clouds
be below me, and I from above may see the land." God replied: "This,
too, seems to Me like a breaking of My vow." Moses: "Lord of the world!
Cut me up, limb by limb, throw me over the Jordan, and then revive me,
so that I may see the land." God: "That, too, would be as if I had
broken My vow." Moses: "Let me skim the land with my glance." God: "In
this point will I comply with thy wish. 'Thou shalt see the land before
thee; but thou shalt not go thither.'" God thereupon showed him all the
land of Israel, and although it was a square of four hundred parasangs,
still God imparted such strength to Moses' eyes that he could oversee
all the land. What lay in the deep appeared to him above, the hidden was
plainly in view, the distant was close at hand, and he saw everything.

### MOSES BEHOLDS THE FUTURE

Pointing to the land, God said: "'This is the land which I sware unto
Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy
seed;' to them did I promise it, but to thee do I show it." But he saw
not only the land. God pointed with His finger to every part of the Holy
Land, and accurately described it to Moses, saying, "This is Judah's
share, this Ephraim's," and in this way instructed him about the
division of the land. Moses learned from God the history of the whole
land, and the history of every part of it. God showed it to him as it
would appear in its glory, and how it would appear under the rule of
strangers. God revealed to him not only the complete history of Israel
that was to take place in the Holy Land, but also revealed to him all
its creation to the Day of Judgement, when the resurrection of the dead
will take place. Joshua's war with the Canaanites, Israel's deliverance
from the Philistines through Samson, the glory of Israel in David's
reign, the building of the Temple under Solomon, and its destruction,
the line of kings from the house of David, and the line of prophets from
the house of Rahab, the destruction of Gog and Magog on the plain of
Jericho, all this and much more, was it given Moses to see. And as God
showed him the events in the world, so too did he show him Paradise with
its dwellers of piety, and hell with the wicked men that fill it.

The place whence Moses looked upon the Holy Land was a mountain that
bore four names: Nebo, Abarim, Hor, and Pisgah. The different
appellations are due to the fact that the kingdoms accounted it as a
special honor to themselves if they had possessions in the Holy Land.
This mountain was divided among four kingdoms, and each kingdom had a
special name for its parts. The most appropriate name seems to be Nebo,
for upon it died three sinless nebi'im, "prophets," Moses, Aaron and
Miriam.

To this mountain, upon God's command, Moses betook himself at noon of
the day on which he died. On this occasion, as upon two others, God had
His commands executed at noon to show mankind that they could not hinder
the execution of God's orders, even if they chose to do so. Had Moses
gone to die on Mount Nebo at night, Israel would have said: "He could
well do so in the night when we knew of nothing. Had we known that he
should go to Nebo to his death, we should not have let him go. Verily,
we should not have permitted him to die, who led us out of Egypt, who
clove the sea for us, who caused manna to rain down and the well to
spring up, who bade the quails to fly to us, and performed many other
great miracles." God therefore bade Moses go to his grave on mount Nebo
in bright daylight, at noon hour, saying, "Let him who wishes to prevent
it try to do so."

For a similar reason did Israel's exodus from Egypt take place in the
noon hour, for, had they departed at night, the Egyptians would have
said: "They were able to do this in the darkness of the night because we
knew nothing of it. Had we known, we should not have permitted them to
depart, but should have compelled them by force of arms to stay in
Egypt." God therefore said: "I shall lead out Israel to the noon hour.
Let him who wishes to prevent it try to do so."

Noah, too, entered the ark at the noon hour for a similar reason. God
said: "If Noah enters the ark at night, his generation will declare: 'He
could do so because we were not aware of it, or we should not have
permitted him to enter the ark alone, but should have taken our hammers
and axes, and crushed the ark.' Therefore," said God, "do I wish him to
enter the ark at the noon hour. Let him who wishes to prevent it try to
do so."

God's command to Moses to betake himself to Mount Nebo, and there to
die, was couched in the following words: means not destruction, but
elevation. 'Die in the mount whither thou goest up;' go up all alone,
and let no one accompany thee. Aaron's son Eleazar accompanied him to
his tomb, but no man shall witness the distinction and reward that await
thee at thy death. There shalt thou be gather to thy people, to the
fathers of Israel, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to thy fathers, Kohath
and Amram, as well as to thy brother Aaron and thy sister Miriam, just
as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his
people." For when Aaron was to die, Moses drew off one by one his
garments, with which he invested Aaron's son Eleazar, and after he had
taken off all his garments, he clothed him in his death robe. Then he
said to Aaron: "Aaron, my brother, enter the cave," and he entered. "Get
upon the couch," said Moses, and Aaron did so. "Close thine eyes," and
he closed them. "Stretch out thy feet," and Aaron did so, and expired.
At sight of this painless and peaceful death, Moses said: "Blessed is
the man that dies such a death!" When therefore Moses' end drew nigh,
God said: "Thou shalt die the death that thou didst wish, as peacefully
and with as little pain as thy brother Aaron."

### MOSES MEETS THE MESSIAH IN HEAVEN

Moses received still another special distinction on the day of his
death, for on that day God permitted him to ascend to the lofty place of
heaven, and showed him the reward that awaited him in heaven, and the
future. The Divine attribute of Mercy appeared there before him and said
to him: "I bring glad tidings to thee, at which thou wilt rejoice. Turn
to the Throne of Mercy and behold!" Moses turned to the Throne of Mercy
and saw God build the Temple of jewels and pearls, while between the
separate gems and pearls shimmered the radiance of the Shekinah,
brighter than all jewels. And in this Temple he beheld the Messiah,
David's son, and his own brother Aaron, standing erect, and dressed in
the robe of the high priest. Aaron then said to Moses: "Do not draw
near, for this is the place where the Shekinah dwells, and know that no
one may enter here before he have tasted of death and his soul have been
delivered to the Angel of Death."

Moses now fell upon his face before God, saying, "Permit me to speak to
Thy Messiah before I die." God then said to Moses: "Come, I shall teach
thee My great name, that the flames of the Shekinah consume thee not."
When the Messiah, David's son, and Aaron beheld Moses approach them,
they knew that God had taught him the great name, so they went to meet
him and saluted him with the greeting: "Blessed be he that cometh in the
name of the Lord." Moses thereupon said to Messiah: "God told me that
Israel was to erect a Temple to Him upon earth, and I now see Him build
His own Temple, and that, too, in heaven!" The Messiah replied: "Thy
father Jacob saw the Temple that will be erected on earth, and also the
Temple that God rears with His own hand in heaven, and he clearly
understood that it was the Temple God constructed with His own hand in
heaven as house of jewels, of pearls, and of the light of the Shekinah,
that was to be preserved for Israel to all eternity, to the end of all
generations. This was in the night when Jacob slept upon a stone, and in
his dream beheld one Jerusalem upon earth, and another in heaven. God
then said to Jacob, 'My son Jacob, to-day I stand above thee as in the
future thy children will stand before Me.' At the sight of these two
Jerusalems, the earthly and the heavenly, Jacob said: 'The Jerusalem on
earth is nothing, this is not the house that will be preserved for my
children in all generations, but in truth that other house of God, that
He builds with His own hands.' But if thou sayest," continued the
Messiah, "that God with His own hands builds Himself a Temple in heaven,
know then that with His hands also He will build the Temple upon earth."

When Moses heard these words from the mouth of the Messiah, he rejoiced
greatly, and lifting up his face to God, he said, "O Lord of the world!
When will this Temple built here in heaven come down to earth below?"
God replied: "I have made known the time of the event to no creature,
either to the earlier ones or to the later, how then should I tell
thee?" Moses said: "Give me a sign, so that out of the happenings in the
world I may gather when that time will approach," God: "I shall first
scatter Israel as with a shovel over all the earth, so that they may be
scattered among all nations in the four corners of the earth, and then
shall I "set My hand again the second time,' and gather them in that
migrated with Jonah, the son of Amittai, to the land of Pathros, and
those that dwell in the land of Shinar, Hamath, Elam, and the islands of
the sea."

When Moses had heard this, he departed from heaven with a joyous spirit.
The Angel of Death followed him to earth, but could not possess himself
of Moses' soul, for he refused to give it up to him, delivering it to
none but God Himself.

### THE LAST HOURS OF MOSES

When Moses had finished looking upon the land and the future, he was one
hour nearer to death. A voice sounded from heaven and said, "Make no
fruitless endeavors to live." Moses, however, did not desist from
prayer, saying to God: "Lord of the world! Let me stay on this side of
the Jordan with the sons of Reuben and the sons of God, that I may be as
one of them, while Joshua as king at the head of Israel shall enter into
the land beyond the Jordan." God replied: "Dost thou wish Me to make as
naught the words in the Torah that read, 'Three times in the year all
thy males shall appear before the Lord God?' If Israel sees that thou
dost not make a pilgrimage to the sanctuary, they will say, 'If Moses,
through whom the Torah and the laws were given to us, does not make the
pilgrimage to the sanctuary, how much less do we need to do so!' Thou
wouldst then cause nonobservance of My commandments. I have,
furthermore, written in the Torah through thee, 'At the end of every
seven years, in the set time of the year of release, when all Israel is
come to appear before the Lord thy God, in the place which He shall
choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing.' If
thou wert to live thou shouldst put Joshua's authority in the eyes of
all Israel to naught, for they would say, 'Instead of learning the Torah
and hearing it from the mouth of the disciple, let us rather go to the
teacher and learn from him.' Israel will then abandon Joshua and go to
thee, so that thou wouldst cause rebellion against My Torah, in which is
written that the king shall read before all Israel the Torah in the set
time of the year of release."

In the meanwhile still another hour had passed, and a voice sounded from
heaven and said: "How long wilt thou endeavor in vain to avert the
sentence? Thou has not only two hours more of life." The wicked Samael,
head of evil spirits, had eagerly awaited the moment of Moses' death,
for he hoped to take his soul like that of all other mortals, and he
said continually, "When will the moment be at hand when Michael shall
weep and I shall triumph?" When now only two hours remained before
Moses' death, Michael, Israel's guardian angel, began to weep, and
Samael was jubilant, for now the moment he had awaited so long was very
close. But Michael said to Samael: "'Rejoice not against me, mine enemy:
when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord shall be a
light unto me.' Even if I fell on account of Moses's death, I shall
arise again through Joshua when he will conquer the one and thirty kings
of Palestine. Even if I sit in darkness owing to the destruction of the
first and second Temples, the Lord shall be my light on the day of the
Messiah."

In the meanwhile still another hour had passed, and a voice resounded
from heaven and said, "Moses, thou hast only one hour more of life!"
Moses thereupon said: "O Lord of the world! Even if Thou wilt not let me
enter into the land of Israel, leave me at least in this world, that I
may live, and not die." God replied, "If I should not let thee die in
this world, how then can I revive thee hereafter for the future world?
Thou wouldst, moreover, then give the lie to the Torah, for through thee
I wrote therein, 'neither is there any that can deliver out of My
hand.'" Moses continued to pray: "O Lord of the world! If thou dost not
permit me to enter into the land of Israel, let me live like the beasts
of the field, and feed on herbs, and drink water, let me live and see
the world: let me be as one of these." But God said, "Let it suffice
thee!" Still Moses continued: "If Thou wilt not grant me this, let me at
least live in this world like a bird that flies in the four directions
of the world, and each day gathers its food from the ground, drinks
water out of the streams, and at eve returns to its nest." But even this
last prayer of his was denied, for God said, "Thou hast already made too
many words."

Moses now raised up his voice in weeping, and said, "To whom shall I go
that will now implore mercy to me?" He went to every work of creation
and said, "Implore mercy for me." But all replied: "We cannot even
implore mercy for ourselves, for God 'hath made everything beautiful in
its time,' but afterward, 'all go unto one place, all are of the dust,
and all turn to dust again,' 'for the heaven shall vanish away like
smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment.'"

When Moses saw that none of the works of creation could aid him, he
said: "He is 'the Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are
judgement: A God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is
He.'"

When Moses saw that he could not escape death, he called Joshua, and in
the presence of all Israel addressed him as follows: "Behold, my son,
the people that I deliver into thy hands, is the people of the Lord. It
is still in its youth, and hence is inexperienced in the observance of
its commandments; beware, therefore, lest thou speak harshly to them,
for they are the children of the Holy One, who called them, 'My
firstborn son, Israel'; and He loved them before all other nations." But
God, on the other hand, at once said to Joshua: "Joshua, thy teacher
Moses has transferred his office to thee. Follow now in his footsteps,
take a rod and hit upon the head, 'Israel is a child, hence I love him,'
and 'withhold not correction from the child.'"

Joshua now said to Moses: "O my teacher Moses, what will become of me?
If I give to the one a share upon a mountain, he will be sure to want
one in the valley, and he to whom I give his share in the valley will
wish it to be upon a mountain." Moses, however, quieted him, saying, "Be
not afraid, for God hath assured me that there will be peace at the
distribution of the land." Then Moses said: "Question me regarding all
the laws that are not quite clear to thee, for I shall be taken from
thee, and thou shalt see me no more." Joshua replied, "When, O my
master, by night or by day, have I ever left thee, that I should be in
doubt concerning anything that thou hast taught me?" Moses said, "Even
if thou hast no questions to ask to me, come hither, that I may kiss
thee." Joshua went to Moses, who kissed him and wept upon his neck, and
a second time blessed him, saying, "Mayest thou be at peace, and Israel
be at peace with thee."

### THE BLESSING OF MOSES

The people now came to Moses and said, "The hour of thy death is at
hand," and he replied: "Wait until I have blessed Israel. All my life
long they had no pleasant experiences with me, for I constantly rebuked
them and admonished them to fear God and fulfil the commandments,
therefore do I not now wish to depart out of this world before I have
blessed them." Moses had indeed always cherished the desire of blessing
Israel, but the Angel of Death had never permitted him to satisfy his
wish, so shortly before dying, he enchained the Angel of Death, cast him
beneath his feet, and blessed Israel in spite of their enemy, saying,
"Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance: feed them also, and bear
them up for ever."

Moses was not the first to bestow blessings, as former generations had
also done so, but no blessing was as effective as his. Noah blessed his
sons, but it was a divided blessing, being intended for Shem, whereas
Ham, instead of being blessed, was cursed. Isaac blessed his sons, but
his blessings led to a dispute, for Esau envied Jacob his blessings.
Jacob blessed his sons, but even his blessing was not without a blemish,
for in blessing he rebuked Reuben and called him to account for the sins
he had committed. Even the number of Moses' blessings excelled that of
his predecessors. For when God created the world, He blessed Adam and
Eve, and this blessing remained upon the world until the flood, when it
ceased. When Noah left the ark, God appeared before him and bestowed
upon him anew the blessing that had vanished during the flood, and this
blessing rested upon the world until Abraham came into the world and
received a second blessing from God, who said, "And I will make of thee
a great nation, and I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him
that curseth thee." God then said to Abraham: "Henceforth it no longer
behooves Me to bless My creatures in person, but I shall leave the
blessings to thee: he whom thou blessest, shall be blessed by Me."
Abraham did not, however, bless his own son Isaac, in order that the
villain Esau might not have a share in that blessing. Jacob, however,
received not only two blessings from his father, but one other besides
from the angel with whom he wrestled, and one from God; and the blessing
also that had been Abraham's to bestow upon his house went to Jacob.
When Jacob blessed his sons, he passed on to them the five blessings he
had received, and added one other. Balaam should really have blessed
Israel with seven benedictions, corresponding to the seven altars he had
erected, but he envied Israel greatly, and blessed them with only three
blessings. God thereupon said: "Thou villain that begrudgest Israel
their blessings! I shall not permit thee to bestow upon Israel all the
blessing that are their due. Moses, who had 'a benevolent eye,' shall
bless Israel." And so, too, it came to pass. Moses added a seventh
blessing to the six benedictions with which Jacob had blessed his twelve
sons. This was not, however, the first time that Moses blessed the
people. He blessed them at the erection of the Tabernacle, then at its
consecration, a third time at the installation of the judges, and a
fourth time on the day of his death.

Before bestowing his blessing upon Israel, however, Moses intoned a song
in God's praise, for it is fitting to glorify God's name before asking a
favor of Him, and as Moses was about to ask God to bless Israel, he
first proclaimed His grandeur and His majesty.

He said: "When God first revealed Himself to Israel to bestow the Torah
upon them, He appeared to them not from one direction, but from all four
at once. He 'came from Sinai,' which is in the South, 'and rose from
Seir unto them,' that is in the East; 'He shined forth from mount
Paran,' that is in the North, 'and he came from the ten thousands of
holy' angels that dwell in the West. He proclaimed the Torah not only in
the language of Sinai, that is Hebrew, but also in the tongue of Seir,
that is Roman, as well as in Paran's speech, that is Arabic, and in the
speech of Kadesh, that is Aramaic, for He offered the Torah not to
Israel alone, but to all the nations of the earth. These, however, did
not want to accept it, hence His wrath against them, and His especial
love for Israel who, despite their awed fear and trembling upon God's
appearance on Sinai, still accepted the Torah. Lord of the World!"
continued Moses, "When Israel shall have been driven out of their land,
be mindful still of the merits of their Patriarchs and stand by them,
deliver them in Thy mercy from 'the yoke of the nations,' and from
death, and guide them in the future world as Thou didst lead them in the
desert."

At these words Israel exclaimed, "The Torah that Moses brought to us at
the risk of his life is our bride, and no other nation may lay claim to
it. Moses was our king when the seventy elders assembled, and in the
future the Messiah will be our king, surrounded by seven shepherds, and
he will gather together once more the scattered tribes of Israel." Then
Moses said: "God first appeared in Egypt to deliver His people, then at
Sinai to give them the Torah, and He will appear a third time to take
vengeance at Edom, and will finally appear to destroy Gog."

After Moses had praised and glorified God, he began to implore His
blessing for the tribes. His first prayer to God concerned Reuben, for
whom he implored forgiveness for his sin with Bilhah. He said: "May
Reuben come to life again in the future world for his good deed in
saving Joseph, and may he not remain forever dead on account of his sin
with Bilhah. May Reuben's descendants also be heroes in war, and heroes
in their knowledge of the Torah." God granted this prayer and forgave
Reuben's sin in accordance with the wish of the other tribes, who begged
God to grant forgiveness to their eldest brother. Moses at once
perceived that God had granted his prayer, for all the twelve stones in
the high priest's breastplate began to gleam forth, whereas formerly
Reuben's stone had given forth no light. When Moses saw that God had
forgiven Reuben's sin, he at once set about trying to obtain God's
pardon for Judah, saying, "Was it not Judah that through his penitent
confession of his sin with his daughter-in-law Tamar induced Reuben,
too, to seek atonement and repentance!" The sin for which Moses asked
God to forgive Judah was that he had never redeemed his promise to bring
Benjamin back to his father. Owing to this sin, his corpse fell to
pieces, so that its bones rolled about in their coffin during the forty
years' march in the desert. But as soon as Moses prayed to God, saying,
"Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah," the bones joined together once more,
but his sin was not quite forgiven, for he was not yet admitted to the
heavenly academy. Therefore Moses continued to pray: "Bring him in unto
his people," and he was admitted. It did not, indeed, benefit him, for
in punishment of his sin, God brought it to pass that he could not
follow the discussion of the scholars in heaven, much less take part in
them, whereupon Moses prayed: "Let his hands be sufficient for him," and
them he no longer sat as one dumb in the heavenly academy. But still his
sin was not quite forgiven, for Judah could not succeed in being
victorious in the disputes of the learned, hence Moses prayed, "And Thou
shalt be an help against his adversaries." It was only then that Judah's
sin was quite forgiven, and that he succeeded in disputes with his
antagonists in the heavenly academy.

As Moses prayed for Judah, so too did he pray for his seed, and
especially for David and the royal dynasty of David. He said: "When
David, king of Israel, shall be in need, and shall pray to Thee, then,
'Hear, Lord, his voice, and Thou shalt be an help against his
adversaries,' 'bring him' then back 'to his people' in peace; and when
alone he shall set out into battle against Goliath, 'let his hands be
sufficient for him, and Thou shalt be an help against his adversaries.'"
Moses at the same time prayed God to stand by the tribe of Judah, whose
chief weapon in war was the bow, that their 'hands might be sufficient,'
that they might vigorously and with good aim speed the arrow.

As Moses had never forgiven Simeon their sin with the daughters of Moab,
he bestowed upon them no blessing, but this tribe also was not quite
forgotten, for he included this tribe in his blessing for Judah, praying
to God, that He might hear Judah's voice whenever he should pray for the
tribe of Simeon when they should be in distress, and that furthermore He
should give them their possession in the Holy Land beside Judah's.

Simeon and Levi "drank out of the same cup," for both together in their
wrath slew the inhabitants of Shechem, but whereas Levi made amends for
his sin, Simeon added another new one. It was the Levites who, in their
zeal for God, slew those that worshipped the Golden Calf; it was a
Levite, Phinehas, moreover, who in his zeal for God slew the wicked
prince of the tribe of Simeon, and his mistress. Hence Moses praised and
blessed the tribe of Levi, whereas he did not even consider Simeon with
a word.

His words first referred to Aaron, prince of the tribe of Levi. He said:
"Well may Thy Urim and Tummim belong to Aaron, who ministered services
of love to Thy children, who stood every test that Thou didst put upon
him, and who at the 'waters of rebellion' became the victim of a wrong
accusation." God had then decreed against Aaron that he was to die in
the desert, although not he, but Moses had trespassed against Him,
saying to Israel, "Hear now, ye rebels." As Aaron, prince of the tribe
of Levi, when Israel was still in Egypt, declaimed passionately against
the people because they worshipped idols, so too all the tribe of Levi
stood up by God's standard when Israel worshipped the Golden Calf in the
desert, and slew the idolaters, even if they were their half-brothers or
their daughters sons. The Levites also were the only ones who, in Egypt
as in the desert, remained true to God and His teachings, did not
abandon the token of the covenant, and were not tempted to rebellion by
the spies. "Hence," continued Moses, "shall the Levites be the only ones
from whose mouth shall issue judgement and instruction for Israel. 'Thy
shall put incense' in the Holy of Holies, 'and whole burnt offerings
upon His altar.' Their sacrifices shall reconcile Israel with God, and
they themselves shall be blessed with earthly goods. Thou, Lord,
'smitest through the loins of them that rise up against them' that
dispute the priestly rights of this tribe, Thou didst destroy Korah, and
they 'that hated them' like king Uzziah, 'shall not rise again.' 'Bless,
Lord, the substance of the Levites who give from the tithes that they
receive one-tenth to the priests. Mayest Thou accept sacrifice from the
hands of the priest Elijah upon mount Carmel, 'smite the loins' of his
enemy Ahab, break the neck of the latter's false prophets, and may the
enemies of the high priest Johanan rise not again."

"Benjamin," said Moses, "is the beloved of the Lord, whom he will always
shield, and in whose possession the sanctuary shall stand, in this world
as well as in the time of the Messiah, and in the future world."

Moses blessed Joseph's tribe with the blessing that their possession
might be the most fruitful and blessed land on earth; dew shall ever be
there, and many wells spring up. It shall constantly be exposed to the
gentle influences of sun and moon, that the fruits may ripen early. "I
wish him," said Moses, "that the blessings given him by the Patriarchs
and the wives of the Patriarchs may be fulfilled." And so, too, it came
to pass, for the land of the tribe of Joseph possessed everything, and
nothing within it was lacking. This was the reward to Joseph for having
fulfilled the will of God that was revealed to Moses in the bush of
thorns; and also because as king of Egypt he treated his brothers with
high honors although they had thrust him from their midst. Moses
furthermore blessed Joseph by promising him that, as he had been the
first of Jacob's sons to come to Egypt, he was also to be the first in
the future world to appear in the Holy Land. Moses proclaimed the
heroism of Joseph's seed in the words: "As it is a vain thing to try to
force the firstling bullock to labor, so little shall Joseph's sons be
yoked into service by the empires; as the unicorn with his horns pushes
away all other animals, so, too, shall Joseph's sons rule the nations,
even to the ends of the earth. The Ephraimite Joshua shall destroy
myriads of heathens, and the Manassite Gideon thousands of them."

Zebulun was the tribe that before all the other tribes devoted itself to
commerce, and in this way acted as the agent between Israel and the
other nations, selling the products of Palestine to the latter, and
foreign wares to the former. Hence the blessing that Moses bestowed upon
them. "'Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out' on commercial enterprises;
at thy instance shall many nations pray upon the sacred mountain of the
Temple and offer their sacrifices." For the people that came into
Zebulun's realms on matters of business used to go from thence to
Jerusalem to look upon the sanctuary of the Jews, and many of them were
converted through the grand impression that the life in the holy city
made upon them. Moses furthermore blessed this tribe by giving them an
estate by the sea, which might yield them costly fish and the purple
shell, and the sand of whose shores might furnish them the material for
glass. The other tribes were therefore dependent upon Zebulun for these
articles, which they could not obtain from any one else, for whosoever
attempted to rob Zebulun of them, was doomed to bad luck in business. It
is the "Sea of Chaifa" also, within Zebulun's territory, where all the
treasures of the ocean were brought to shore; for whenever a ship is
wrecked at sea, the ocean sends it and its treasures to the sea of
Chaifa, where it is hoarded for the pious until the Judgement Day. One
other blessing of Zebulun was that it would always be victorious in
battle, whereas the tribe of Issachar, closely bound up with it, was
blessed by its distinction in the "tents of learning." For Issachar was
"the tribe of scholars and of judges," wherefore Moses blessed them,
saying that in "the future time," Israel's great house of instruction as
well as the great Sanhedrin would be located in this tribe.

The tribe of Gad, dwelling on the boundary of the land of Israel,
received the benediction that in "the future time" it would be as strong
in battle as it had been at the first conquest of Palestine, and would
hereafter stand at the head of Israel on their return to the Holy Land,
as it had done on their first entrance into the land. Moses praised this
tribe for choosing its site on this side the Jordan because that place
had been chosen to hold Moses' tomb. Moses indeed died on mount Nebo,
which is Reuben's possession, but his body was taken from Nebo by the
pinions of the Shekinah, and brought to Gad's territory, a distance of
four miles, amid the lamentations of the angels, who said, "He shall
enter into peace and rest in his bed."

Dan, who like Gad had his territory on the boundary of the land, was
also blessed with strength and might, that he might ward off the attacks
of Israel's enemies. He was also blessed in receiving his territory in
the Holy Land in two different sections of it.

Naphtali's blessing read: "O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full
with the blessing of the Lord: possess thou the west and the south."
This blessing was verified, for the tribe of Naphtali had in its
possession an abundance of fish and mushrooms, so that they could
maintain themselves without much labor; and the valley of Gennesaret
furthermore was their possession, whose fruits were renowned for their
extraordinary sweetness. But Naphtali was blessed not with material
blessings only, but also with spiritual; for it was the great house of
instruction at Tiberias to which Moses alluded when he said of Naphtali,
"he is 'full with the blessings of the Lord.'"

Moses called Asher the favorite of his brethren, for it was this tribe
that in the years of release provided nourishment for all Israel, as its
soil was so productive that what grew of its own accord sufficed to
sustain all. But Moses blessed Asher in particular with a land rich in
olives, so that oil flowed in streams through Asher's land. Hence Moses
blessed him the words: "The treasures of all lands shall flow to thee,
for the nations shall give thee gold and silver for thine oil." He
blessed Asher moreover with many sons, and with daughters that preserved
the charms of youth in their old age.

As Moses uttered eleven benedictions, so likewise did he compose eleven
psalms, corresponding to the eleven tribes blessed by him. These psalms
of Moses were later received into David's Psalter, where the psalms of
Adam, Melchizedek, Abraham, Solomon, Asaph, and the three sons of Korah
also found their place. Moses' first psalms says, "'Thou turnest man to
destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men,' and forgivest the
forefather of the tribe of Reuben who sinned, but returned again to
God." Another one of Moses' psalms reads, "He that dwelleth in the
secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the
Almighty," which corresponds to the tribe of Levi that dwelled in the
sanctuary, the shadow of the Almighty. To the tribe of Judah, whose name
signifies, "Praise the Lord," belongs the psalm, "It is a good thing to
give thanks unto the Lord." The psalm: "The Lord is apparelled with
majesty," is Benjamin's, for the sanctuary stood in his possession,
hence this psalm closes with the words, "Holiness becometh Thine house,
O Lord, forevermore." The psalm: "O Lord, Thou God to whom vengeance
belongeth; Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth," was
composed by Moses for the tribe of Gad; for Elijah, a member of this
tribe, was to destroy the foundations of the heathens, and to wreak upon
them the vengeance of the Lord. To the tribe of learned men, Issachar,
goes the psalm: "O come, let us sing unto the Lord: let us make a joyful
noise to the rock of our salvation," for it is this tribe that occupy
themselves with the Torah, the book of praise.

### MOSES PRAYS FOR DEATH

Moses still had many other blessings for every single tribe, but when he
perceived that his time had drawn to a close, he included them all in
one blessing, saying, "Happy art thou, O Israel: Who is like unto thee,
a people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and that is the
sword of thy excellency!" With these words he at the same time answered
a question that Israel had put to him, saying, "O tell us, our teacher
Moses, what is the blessing that God will bestow upon us in the future
world?" He replied: "I cannot describe it to you, but all I can say is,
happy ye that such is decreed for ye!" Moses at the same time begged God
that in the future world He might restore to Israel the heavenly weapon
that He had taken from them after the worship of the Golden Calf. God
said, "I swear that I shall restore it to them."

When Moses had finished his blessing, he asked Israel to forgive his
sternness toward them, saying: "Ye have had much to bear from me in
regard to the fulfillment of the Torah and its commandments, but forgive
me now." They replied: "Our teacher, our lord, it is forgiven." It was
not their turn to ask his forgiveness, which they did in these words:
"We have often kindled thine anger and have laid many burdens upon thee,
but forgive us now." He said, "It is forgiven."

In the meanwhile people came to him and said, "The hour has come in
which thou departest from the world." Moses said, "Blessed be His name
that liveth and endureth in all eternity!" Turning to Israel, he then
said, "I pray ye, when ye shall have entered into the land of Israel,
remember me still, and my bones, and say, 'Woe to the son of Amram that
ran before us like a horse, but whose bones remained in the desert.'"
Israel said to Moses: "O our teacher, what will become of us when thou
art gone?" He replied: "While I was with ye, God was with ye; yet think
not that all the signs and miracles that He wrought through me were
performed for my sake, for much rather were they done for your sake, and
for His love and mercy, and if ye have faith in Him, He will work your
desires. 'Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom
there is no help,' for how could ye expect help from a man, a creature
of flesh and blood, that cannot shield himself from death? Put,
therefore, your trust in Him through whose word arose the world, for He
liveth and endureth in all eternity. Whether ye be laden with sin, or
not, 'pour your heart before Him,' and turn to Him." Israel said: "'The
Lord, He is God; the Lord, He is God.' God is our strength and our
refuge."

Then a voice sounded from heaven and said, "Why, Moses, dost thou strive
in vain? Thou had but one-half hour more of life in the world." Moses,
to whom God had now shown the reward of the pious in the future world,
and the gates of salvation and of consolation that He would hereafter
open to Israel, now said: "Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto
thee, a people saved by the Lord!" He then bade farewell to the people,
weeping aloud. He said: "Dwell in peace, I shall see ye again at the
Resurrection," and so he went forth from them, weeping aloud. Israel,
too, broke into loud lamentations, so that their weeping ascended to the
highest heavens.

Moses took off his outer garment, rent his shirt, strewed dust upon his
head, covered it like a mourner, and in this condition betook himself to
his tent amid tears and lamentations, saying: "Woe to my feet that may
not enter the land of Israel, woe to my hands that may not pluck of its
fruits! Woe to my palate that may not taste the fruits of the land that
flows with milk and honey!"

Moses then took a scroll, wrote upon it the Ineffable Name, and the book
of the song, and betook himself to Joshua's tent to deliver it to him.
When he arrived at Joshua's tent, Joshua was seated, and Moses remained
standing before him in a bowed attitude without being noticed by Joshua.
For God brought this to pass in order that Moses, on account of this
disrespectful treatment, might himself wish for death. For when Moses
had prayed to God to let him live, were it only as a private citizen,
God granted his prayer, saying to him, "If thou hast no objection to
subordinating thyself to Joshua, then mayest thou live," and in
accordance with this agreement, Moses had betaken himself to hear
Joshua's discourse.

The people who had gathered as usual before Moses' tent to hear from him
the word of God, failed to find him there, and hearing that he had gone
to Joshua, went there likewise, where they found Moses standing and
Joshua seated. "What art thou thinking of," they called out to Joshua,
"that thou art seated, while thy teacher Moses stands before thee in a
bowed attitude and with folded hands?" In their anger and indignation
against Joshua, they would instantly have slain him, had not a cloud
descended and interposed itself between the people and Joshua. When
Joshua noticed that Moses stood before him, he instantly arose, and
cried in tears: "O my father and teacher Moses, that like a father didst
rear me from my youth, and that didst instruct me in wisdom, why dost
thou do such a thing as will bring upon me Divine punishment?" The
people now besought Moses as usual to instruct them in the Torah, but he
replied, "I have no permission to do so." They did not, however, cease
importuning him, until a voice sounded from heaven and said, "Learn from
Joshua." The people now consented to acknowledge Joshua as their
teacher, and seated themselves before him to hear his discourse. Joshua
now began his discourse with Moses sitting at his right, and Aaron's
sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, at this left. But hardly had Joshua begun his
lecture with the words, "Praised be God that taketh delight in the pious
and their teachings," when the treasures of wisdom vanished from Moses
and passed over into Joshua's possession, so that Moses was not even
able to follow his disciple Joshua's discourse. When Joshua had finished
his lecture, Israel requested Moses to review with them what Joshua had
taught, but he said, "I know not how to reply to your request!" He began
to expound Joshua's lecture to them, but could not, for he had not
understood it. He now said to God: "Lord of the world! Until not I
wished for life, but now I long to die. Rather a hundred deaths, than
one jealousy."

### SAMAEL CHASTISED BY MOSES

When God perceived that Moses was prepared to die, He said to the angel
Gabriel, "Go, fetch Me Moses' soul." But he replied, "How should I
presume to approach and take the soul of him that outweighs sixty
myriads of mortals!" God then commissioned the angel Michael to fetch
Moses' soul, but he amid tears refused on the same grounds as Gabriel.
God then said to the angel Zagzagel, "Fetch Me Moses' soul!" He replied,
"Lord of the world! I was his teacher and he my disciple, how then
should I take his soul!" Then Samael appeared before God and said: "Lord
of the world! Is Moses, Israel's teacher, indeed greater than Adam whom
thou didst create in Thine image and Thy likeness? Is Moses greater,
perchance, than Thy friend Abraham, who to glorify Thy name cast himself
into the fiery furnace? Is Moses greater, perchance, than Isaac, who
permitted himself to be bound upon the altar as a sacrifice to Thee? Or
is he greater than Thy firstborn Jacob, or than his twelve sons, Thy
saplings? Not one of them escaped me, give me therefore permission to
fetch Moses' soul." God replied: "Not one of all these equals him. How,
too, wouldst thou take his soul? From his face? How couldst thou
approach his face that had looked upon My Face! From his hands? Those
hands received the Torah, how then shouldst thou be able to approach
them! From his feet? His feet touched My clouds, how then shouldst thou
be able to approach them! Nay, thou canst not approach him at all." But
Samael said, "However it be, I pray Thee, permit me to fetch his soul! "
God said, "Thou had My consent."

Samael now went forth from God in great glee, took his sword, girded
himself with cruelty, wrapped himself in wrath, and in a great rage
betook himself to Moses. When Samael perceived Moses, he was occupied in
writing the Ineffable Name. Dart of fire shot from his mouth, the
radiance of his face and of his eyes shone like the sun, so that he
seemed like an angel of the hosts of the Lord, and Samael in fear and
trembling thought, "It was true when the other angels declared that they
could not seize Moses' soul!"

Moses who had known that Samael would come, even before his arrival, now
lifted his eyes and looked upon Samael, whereupon Samael's eyes grew dim
before the radiance of Moses' countenance. He fell upon his face, and
was seized with the woes of a woman giving birth, so that in his terror
he could not open his mouth. Moses therefore addressed him, saying:
"Samael, Samael! 'There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked!' Why
dost thou stand before me? Get thee hence at once, or I shall cut off
thy head." In fear and trembling Samael replied: "Why art thou angry
with me, my master, give me thy soul, for thy time to depart from the
world is at hand." Moses: "Who sent thee to me?" Samael: "He that
created the world and the souls." Moses: "I will not give thee my soul."
Samael: "All souls since the creation of the world were delivered into
my hands." Moses: "I am greater than all others that came into the
world, I have had a greater communion with the spirit of God than thee
and thou together." Samael: "Wherein lies thy preeminence?" Moses: "Dost
thou not know that I am the son of Amram, that came circumcised out of
my mother's womb, that at the age of three days not only walked, but
even talked with my parents, that took no milk from my mother until she
received her pay from Pharaoh's daughter? When I was three months old,
my wisdom was so great that I made prophecies and said, 'I shall
hereafter from God's right hand receive the Torah.' At the age of six
months I entered Pharaoh's palace and took off the crown from his head.
When I was eighty years old, I brought the ten plagues upon Pharaoh and
the Egyptians, slew their guardian angel, and led the sixty myriads of
Israel out of Egypt. I then clove the sea into twelve parts, led Israel
through the midst of them, and drowned the Egyptians in the same, and it
was not thou that took their souls, but I. It was I, too, that turned
the bitter water into sweet, that mounted into heaven, and there spoke
face to face with God! I hewed out two tables of stone, upon which God
at my request wrote the Torah. One hundred and twenty days and as many
nights did I dwell in heaven, where I dwelled under the Throne of Glory;
like an angel during all this time I ate no bread and drank no water. I
conquered the inhabitants of heaven, made known there secrets to
mankind, received the Torah from God's right hand, and at His command
wrote six hundred and thirteen commandments, which I then taught to
Israel. I furthermore waged war against the heroes of Sihon and Og, that
had been created before the flood and were so tall that the waters of
the flood did not even reach their ankles. In battle with them I bade
sun and moon to stand still, and with my staff slew the two heroes.
Where, perchance, is there in the world a mortal who could do all this?
How darest thou, wicked one, presume to wish to seize my pure soul that
was given me in holiness and purity by the Lord of holiness and purity?
Thou hast no power to sit where I sit, or to stand where I stand. Get
thee hence, I will not give thee my soul."

Samael now in terror returned to God and reported Moses' words to Him.
God's wrath against Samael was now kindled, and He said to him: "Go,
fetch Me Moses soul, for if thou dost not do so, I shall discharge thee
from thine office of taking men's souls, and shall invest another with
it." Samael implored God, saying: "O Lord of the world, whose deed are
terrible, bid me go to Gehenna and there turn uppermost to undermost,
and undermost to uppermost, and I shall at once do so without a moment's
hesitation, but I cannot appear before Moses." God: "Why not, pray?"
Samael: "I cannot do it because he is like the princes in thy great
chariot. Lightning-flashes and fiery darts issue from his mouth when he
speaks with me, just as it is with the Seraphim when they laud, praise
and glorify Thee. I pray Thee, therefore, send me not to him, for I
cannot appear before him." But God in wrath said to Samael: "Go, fetch
Me Moses' soul," and while he set about to execute God's command, the
Lord furthermore said: "Wicked one! Out of the fire of Hell was thou
created, and to the fire of Hell shalt thou eventually return. First in
great joy didst thou set out to kill Moses, but when thou didst perceive
his grandeur and his greatness, thou didst say, 'I cannot undertake
anything against him.' It is clear and manifest before Me that thou wilt
now return from him a second time in shame and humiliation."

Samael now drew his sword out of its sheath and in a towering fury
betook himself to Moses, saying, "Either I shall kill him or he shall
kill me." When Moses perceived him he arose in anger, and with his staff
in his hand, upon which was engraved the Ineffable Name, set about to
drive Samael away. Samael fled in fear, but Moses pursued him, and when
he reached him, he struck him with his staff, blinded him with the
radiance of his face, and then let him run on, covered with shame and
confusion. He was not far from killing him, but a voice resounded from
heaven and said, "Let him live, Moses, for the world is in need of him,"
so Moses had to content himself with Samael's chastisement.

### GOD KISSES MOSES' SOUL

In the meanwhile Moses' time was at an end. A voice from heaven
resounded, saying: "Why, Moses, dost thou strive in vain? Thy last
second is at hand." Moses instantly stood up for prayer, and said: "Lord
of the world! Be mindful of the day on which Thou didst reveal Thyself
to me in the bush of thorns, and be mindful also of the day when I
ascended into heaven and during forty days partook of neither food nor
drink. Thou, Gracious and Merciful, deliver me not into the hand of
Samael." God replied: "I have heard thy prayer. I Myself shall attend to
thee and bury thee." Moses now sanctified himself as do the Seraphim
that surround the Divine Majesty, whereupon God from the highest heavens
revealed Himself to receive Moses' soul. When Moses beheld the Holy One,
blessed he His Name, he fell upon his face and said: "Lord of the world!
In love didst Thou create the world, and in love Thou guidest it. Treat
me also with love, and deliver me not into the hands of the Angel of
Death." A heavenly voice sounded and said: "Moses, be not afraid. 'Thy
righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy
reward.'"

With God descended from heaven three angels, Michael, Gabriel, and
Zagzagel. Gabriel arranged Moses' couch, Michael spread upon it a purple
garment, and Zagzagel laid down a woolen pillow. God stationed Himself
over Moses' head, Michael to his right, Gabriel to his left, and
Zagzagel at his feet, whereupon God addressed Moses: "Cross thy feet,"
and Moses did so. He then said, "Fold thy hands and lay them upon thy
breast," and Moses did so. Then God said, "Close thine eyes," and Moses
did so. Then God spake to Moses' soul: "My daughter, one hundred and
twenty years had I decreed that thou shouldst dwell in this righteous
man's body, but hesitate not now to leave it, for thy time is run." The
soul replied: "I know that Thou art the God of spirits and of souls, and
that in Thy hand are the souls of the living and of the dead. Thou didst
create me and put me into the body of this righteous man. Is there
anywhere in the world a body so pure and holy as this it? Never a fly
rested upon it, never did leprosy show itself upon it. Therefore do I
love it, and do not wish to leave it." God replied: "Hesitate not, my
daughter! Thine end hath come. I Myself shall take thee to the highest
heavens and let thee dwell under the Throne of My Glory, like the
Seraphim, Ofannim, Cherubim, and other angels." But the soul replied:
"Lord of the world! I desire to remain with this righteous man; for
whereas the two angels Azza and Azazel when they descended from heaven
to earth, corrupted their way of life and loved the daughters of the
earth, so that in punishment Thou didst suspend them between heaven and
earth, the son of Amram, a creature of flesh and blood, from the day
upon which Thou didst reveal Thyself from the bush of thorns, has lived
apart from his wife. Let me therefore remain where I am." When Moses saw
that his soul refused to leave him, he said to her: "Is this because the
Angel of Death wished to show his power over thee?" The soul replied:
"Nay, God doth not wish to deliver me into the hands of death." Moses:
"Wilt thou, perchance, weep when the others will weep at my departure?"
The soul: "The Lord 'hath delivered mine eyes from tears.'" Moses: "Wilt
thou, perchance, go into Hell when I am dead?" The soul: "I will walk
before the Lord in the land of the living." When Moses heard these
words, he permitted his soul to leave him, saying to her: "Return unto
thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee." God
thereupon took Moses' soul by kissing him upon the mouth.

Moses activity did not, however, cease with his death, for in heaven he
is one of the servants of the Lord. God buried Moses' body in a spot
that remained unknown even to Moses himself. Only this is know
concerning it, that a subterranean passage connects it with the graves
of the Patriarchs. Although Moses' body lies dead in its grave, it is
still as fresh as when he was alive.

### THE MOURNING FOR MOSES

When Moses died, a voice resounded from heaven throughout all the camp
of Israel, which measured twelve miles in length by twelve in width, and
said, "Woe! Moses is dead. Woe! Moses is dead." All Israel who,
throughout thirty days before Moses' decease, had wept his impending
death now arranged a three months' time of mourning for him. But Israel
were not the only mourners for Moses, God himself wept for Moses,
saying, "Who will rise up for Me against the evil-doers? Who will stand
up for Me against the workers of iniquity?" Metatron appeared before God
and said: "Moses was thine when he lived, and he is Thine in his death."
God replied: "I weep not for Moses' sake, but for the loss Israel
suffered through his death. How often had they angered Me, but he prayed
for them and appeased My wrath." The angels wept with God, saying, "But
where shall wisdom be found?" The heavens lamented: "The godly man is
perished out of the earth." The earth wept: "And there is none upright
among men." Stars, planets, sun, and moon wailed: "The righteous
perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart," and God praised Moses'
excellence in the words: "Thou hast said of Me, 'The Lord He is God:
there is none else,' and therefore shall I say of thee, 'And there arose
not a prophet in Israel like unto Moses.'"

Among mortals, it was particularly Jochebed, Moses' mother, and Joshua,
his disciple, that deeply mourned Moses' death. They were not indeed
certain if Moses were dead, hence they sought him everywhere. Jochebed
went first to Egypt and said to that land, "Mizraim, Mizraim, hast thou
perchance seen Moses?" But Mizraim replied, "As truly as thou livest,
Jochebed, I have not seen him since the day when he slew all the
firstborn here." Jochebed then betook herself to the Nile, saying,
"Nile, Nile, hast thou perchance seen Moses?" But Nile replied, "As
truly as thou livest, Jochebed, I have not seen Moses since the day when
he turned my water to blood." Then Jochebed went to the sea and said,
"Sea, sea, hast thou perchance seen Moses?" The sea replied, "As truly
as thou livest, Jochebed, I have not seen him since the day when he led
the twelve tribes through me." Jochebed thereupon went to the desert and
said, "Desert, desert, hast thou perchance seen Moses?" The desert
replied, "As truly as thou livest, Jochebed, I have not seen him since
the day whereupon he caused manna to rain down upon me." Then Jochebed
went to Sinai, and said, "Sinai, Sinai, hast thou perchance seen Moses?"
Sinai said, "As truly as thou livest, Jochebed, I have not seen him
since the day whereon he descended from me with the two tables of the
law." Jochebed finally went to the rock and said, "Rock, rock, hast thou
perchance seen Moses?" The rock replied, "As truly as thou livest, I
have not seen him since the day when with his staff he twice smote me."

Joshua, too, sought his teacher Moses in vain, and in his grief for
Moses' disappearance he rent his garments, and crying aloud, called
ceaselessly, "'My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the
horsemen thereof.' 'But where shall wisdom be found?'" But God said to
Joshua: "How long wilt thou continue to seek Moses in vain? He is dead,
but indeed it is I that have lost him, and not thou."

### SAMAEL'S VAIN SEARCH

Samael, the Angel of Death, had not heard that God had taken Moses' soul
from his body and received it under the Throne of Glory. Believing that
Moses was still among the living, he betook himself to Moses' house in
order to seize his soul, for he feared to return before God without
having executed His command to take Moses' soul. He did not, however,
find Moses in his accustomed place, so he hastened into the land of
Israel, thinking, "Long did Moses pray to be permitted to enter this
land, and perhaps he is there." He said to the land of Israel, "Is Moses
perchance with thee?" But the land replied, "Nay, he is not found in the
land of the living."

Samael then thought: "I know that God once said to Moses, 'Lift up thy
rod and divide the sea,' so perhaps he is by the sea." He hastened to
the sea and said, "Is Moses here?" The sea replied: "He is not here, and
I have not seen him since the day when he clove me into twelve parts,
and with the twelve tribes passed through me."

Samael then betook himself to Gehenna asking, "Hast thou seen Moses, the
son of Amram?" Gehenna replied, "With mine ears have I heard the cry,
but I have not seen him."

He betook himself to Sheol, Abaddon, and Tit-ha-Yawen, to whom he said,
"Have ye seen the son of Amram?" They replied: "Through Pharaoh, king of
Egypt, have we heard his call, but we have not seen him."

He betook himself to the Abyss and asked, "Hast thou seen the son of
Amram?" The answer arose, "I have not seen him, but heard indeed his
call."

He asked Korah's sons, that dwell with the Abyss, "Have ye seen the son
of Amram?" They replied. "We have not seen him since the day upon which
at Moses' bidding the earth opened its mouth and swallowed us."

He betook himself to the clouds of glory and asked, "Is Moses perchance
with you?" They answered, "He is his from the eyes of all living."

He went to the heavens and asked, "Have ye seen the son of Amram?" The
answer was, "We have not seen him since at God command he mounted to us
to receive the Torah."

He hastened to Paradise, but when the angels that guard its gates beheld
Samael, they drove him away and said, "Wicked one! Wicked one! 'This is
the gate of the Lord; the righteous shall enter into it.'" Samael
thereupon flew over the gates of Paradise and asked Paradise, "Hast thou
perchance seen Moses?" Paradise answered, "Since in Gabriel's company he
visited me to look upon the reward of the pious, I have not seen him."

He went to the tree of life, but even at the distance of three hundred
parasangs, it cried out to him: "Approach me not." He therefore asked
from afar, "Hast thou seen the son of Amram?" The tree replied, "Since
the day on which he came to me to cut him a staff, I have not seen him."

He betook himself to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and
said, "Hast thou seen the son of Amram?" The tree replied, "Since the
day on which he came to me to get a writing reed, wherewith to write the
Torah, I have not seen him."

He betook himself to the mountains with his query. These replied, "Since
he hewed the two tables out of us, we have not seen him."

He went to the deserts and asked, "Have ye seen the son of Amram?" These
replied, "Since he has ceased to lead Israel to pasture upon us, we have
not seen him."

He betook himself to mount Sinai, for he thought God had formerly
commanded Moses to ascend it, and that he might now be there. He asked
Sinai, "Hast thou seen the son of Amram?" Sinai said, "Since the day on
which out of God's right hand he received the Torah upon me, I have not
seen him."

He betook himself to the birds and said, "Have ye seen Moses?" They
replied, "Since the say whereupon he separated the birds into clean and
unclean we have not seen him." He went to the quadrupeds and asked:
"Have ye seen Moses?" They answered: "Since the day on which he
determined which beasts might be eaten, and which might not, we have not
seen him." The answer of the birds and beasts referred to the day on
which God assembled all the species of animals, led them before Moses,
and instructed him which of these were clean and which were not, which
might, and which might not be eaten.

Samael then betook himself to the "Court of the Dead," where the angel
Dumah guards the souls of the deceased, and asked the angel, "Hast thou
seen the son of Amram?" He replied: "I heard the words of lamentation
for him in heaven, but I have not seen him."

He betook himself to the angels and asked, "Have ye seen the son of
Amram?" These made the same reply as Dumah, and advised him to go to the
mortals, who might possibly give him information concerning Moses'
whereabouts.

He betook himself to the mortals and asked, "Where is Moses?" These
replied: "Our teacher Moses is not like human beings. He is the peer of
the angels of ministry, for he ascended into heaven and dwelt in heaven
like the angels, 'he hath gathered the wind in his fists' like an angel,
and God took his soul to Himself in the place of His sanctity. What
connection then hast thou with the son of Amram?"

### MOSES EXCELS ALL PIOUS MEN

The special distinction that God granted to Moses at his death was well
merited, for Moses outweighed all other pious men. When Moses died, Adam
appeared and said, "I am greater than thou, for I was created in God's
image." But Moses replied: "I am nevertheless superior to thee, for the
glory that thou didst receive from God was taken from thee, whereas I
retained the radiance of my face forever."

Noah then said to Moses: "I am greater than thou, for I was preserved
out of the generation of the flood." Moses replied: "I am superior to
thee, for thou didst save thyself alone, and hadst not the power to save
thy generations, but I saved myself and also saved my generation at the
time when they transgressed with the Golden Calf."

Abraham said to Moses, "I am greater than thou, for I fed the
wanderers." Moses: "I am superior to thee, for thou didst feed the
uncircumcised whereas I fed the circumcised; and thou, moreover, didst
feed them in a land of habitations, whereas I fed Israel in the desert."

Isaac said to Moses: "I am greater than thou, for I bared my neck upon
the altar and beheld the Face of the Shekinah." Moses replied: "Still am
I superior to thee, for thou didst indeed behold the Face of the
Shekihah, but thine eyes grew dim, whereas I talked with the Shekinah
face to face, and yet neither did mine eyes grow dim nor my strength
wane."

Jacob said, "I am greater than thou, for I wrestled with the angel and
conquered him." Moses replied: "Thou didst wrestle with the angel upon
thy territory, but I mounted to the angels into their own territory, and
still they feared me."

Joseph said to Moses, "I am greater than thou, for my master's wife
could not tempt me to sin." Moses replied: "Still am I superior to thee,
for thou didst restrain thyself from a strange woman, whereas I
abstained from intercourse with my own wife."

The degreed of Moses' superiority over the other pious men can be seen
by following. Adam died because he has been seduced by the serpent,
whereas Moses fashioned a serpent out of brass at sight of which
everyone that had been bitten by a snake recovered. Noah offered a
sacrifice to God that was accepted, but he himself was not admitted to
God's presence. When Moses, on the other hand, offered a sacrifice in
Israel's name, God said to him, "Know that twice daily I shall dwell
with ye." Abraham had been the cause for Israel's bondage in Egypt, for
that was the punishment for his words, "'Whereby shall I know that I
shall inherit 'the land?" Moses, on the other hand, it was that
delivered Israel out of Egyptian bondage. Jacob indeed conquered in his
struggle with the angel, but the blow that the angel dealt him put
Jacob's thigh out of joint forever, whereas Moses inspired the angels
with such fear that as soon as they beheld him in heaven, they fled.

But Moses not only surpassed all other human beings, he surpassed also
the entire creation that God had brought forth in six days. On the first
day God created light, but Moses mounted into heaven and seized the
spiritual light, the Torah. On the second day God created the firmament,
whereby He decreed that the earth was not to enter the realm of the
firmament, nor the firmament the realm of the earth, but Moses scaled
the firmament even though he belonged to earth. On the third day God
created the sea, but as soon as the sea caught sight of Moses, it
retreated before him affrighted. On the fourth day God created the sun
and the moon to illuminate the earth, but Moses said to God: "I do not
wish sun and moon to give light to Israel, Thou Thyself shalt do so,"
and God granted his prayer. On the fifth day God created the animals,
but Moses slaughtered whatever animals he wanted for Israel's needs.
When, therefore, God laid all the objects of creation on one side of the
scales, and Moses upon the other, Moses outweighed them. Moses was
justly called, "the man of God," for he was half man and half God.

But not in this world alone was Moses the great leader and teacher of
his people, he shall be the same in the future world, in accordance with
the promise God made him shortly before his death. God said: "Thou that
didst lead My children in this world, shalt also lead them in the future
world.
