# XII. ESTHER

### THE FEAST FOR THE GRANDEES

The Book of Esther is the last of the Scriptural writings. The
subsequent history of Israel and all his suffering we know only through
oral tradition. For this reason the heroine of the last canonical book
was named Esther, that is, Venus, the morning-star, which sheds its
light after all the other stars have ceased to shine, and while the sun
still delays to rise. Thus the deeds of Queen Esther cast a ray of light
forward into Israel's history at its darkest.

The Jews at the time of Ahaseurus were like the dove about to enter her
nest wherein a snake lies coiled. Yet she cannot withdraw, because a
falcon bides without to swoop down upon her. In Shushan the Jews were in
the clutches of Haman, and in other lands they were at the mercy of many
murderous enemies to their race, ready to do the bidding of Haman to
destroy and to slay them, and cause them to perish.

But the rescue of the Jews from the hand of their adversaries is only a
part of this wonderful chapter in the history of Israel. No less
important is the exalted station to which they rose in the realm of
Ahasuerus after the fall of Haman, especially the power and dignity to
which Esther herself attained. On this account the magnificent feast
prepared by Ahasuerus for his subjects belongs to the history of Esther.

The splendor of his feast is the gauge whereby to measure the wealth and
power she later enjoyed.

Ahasuerus was not the king of Persia by right of birth. He owed his
position to his vast wealth, with which he purchased dominion over the
whole world.

He had various reasons for giving a gorgeous feast. The third year of
his reign was the seventieth since the beginning of Nebuchadnezzar's
rule, and Ahasuerus thought it quite certain that the time had passed
for the fulfilment of the prophecy of Jeremiah foretelling the return of
Israel to the Holy Land. The Temple was still in ruins, and Ahasuerus
was convinced that the Jewish kingdom would never again be restored.
Needless to say, it was not Jeremiah who erred. Not with the accession
of King Nebuchadnezzar had the prophet's term of years begun, but with
the destruction of Jerusalem. Reckoned in this way, the seventy years of
desolation were at an end exactly at the time when Darius, the son of
Ahasuerus, permitted the rebuilding of the Temple.

Beside this mistaken cause for a celebration, there were reasons
personal to Ahasuerus why he desired to give expression to joy. A short
time before, he had crushed a rebellion against himself, and this
victory he wanted to celebrate with pomp and ceremony. The first part of
the celebration was given over to the hundred and twenty-seven rulers of
the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of his empire. His purpose was to
win the devotion of those of them with whom otherwise he did not come in
direct contact. But can it be said with certainty that this was a good
policy? If he had not first made sure of the loyalty of his capital, was
it not dangerous to have these rulers near him in case of an
insurrection?

For six whole months he celebrated the feast for the grandees the nobles
and the high officials, the latter of whom, according to the
constitution, were all required to be Medians under the Persian king
Ahasuerus, as they would have had to be Persians under a Median king.

This was the program of the feast: In the first month Ahasuerus showed
his treasures to his guests; in the second, the delegates of the king's
royal vassals saw them; in the third the presents were exposed to view;
in the fourth the guests were invited to admire his literary
possessions, among them the sacred scroll; in the fifth his pearl and
diamond-studded ornaments of gold were put on exhibition; and in the
sixth he displayed the treasures which had been given him as tribute.
All this vast wealth, however, appertained to the crown, it was not his
personal property. When Nebuchadnezzar felt his end draw nigh, he
resolved to sink his immense treasures in the Euphrates rather than let
them ascend to his son Evil-merodach, so great was his miserliness. But,
again, when Cyrus gave the Jews permission to build the Temple, his
divinely appointed reward was that he discovered the spot in the river
at which the treasures were sunk, and he was permitted to take
possession of them. These were the treasures of which Ahasuerus availed
himself to glorify his feast. So prodigious were they that during the
six months of the feast he unlocked six treasure-chambers daily to
display their contents to his guests.

When Ahasuerus boasted of his wealth, which he had no right to do, as
his treasures had come from the Temple, God said: "Verily, has the
creature of flesh and blood any possessions of his own? I alone possess
treasures, for 'the silver is mind, and the gold is mine.'"

Among the treasures displayed were the Temple vessels, which Ahasuerus
had desecrated in his drinking bouts. When the noble Jews who had been
invited to the capital saw these, they began to weep, and they refused
to take further part in the festivities. Thereupon the king commanded
that a separate place be assigned to the Jews, so that their eyes might
be spared the painful sight.

This was not the only incident that aroused poignant memories in them,
for Ahasuerus arrayed himself in the robes of state once belonging to
the high priests at Jerusalem, and this, too, made the Jews smart
uncomfortably. The Persian king had wanted to mount the throne of
Solomon besides, but herein he was thwarted, because its ingenious
construction was an enigma to him. Egyptian artificers tried to fashion
a throne after the model of Solomon's, but in vain. After two years'
work they managed to produce a weak imitation of it, and upon this
Ahasuerus sat during his splendid feast.

### THE FESTIVITIES IN SHUSHAN

At the expiration of the hundred and eighty days allotted to the feast
for the nobles, Ahasuerus arranged a great celebration for the residents
of Shushan, the capital city of Elam. From the creation of the world
until after the deluge the unwritten law had been in force, that the
first-born son of the patriarchs was to be the ruler of the world. Thus,
Seth was the successor to Adam, and he was followed in turn by Enosh,
and so the succession went on, from first-born son to first-born son,
down to Noah and his oldest son Shem. Now, the first-born son of Shem
was Elam, and, according to custom, he should have been given the
universal dominion which was his heritage. Shem, being a prophet, knew
that Abraham and his posterity, the Israelites, would not spring from
the family of Elam, but from that of Arpachshad. Therefore he named
Arpachshad as his successor, and through him rulership descended to
Abraham, and so to Isaac, Jacob, and Judah, and to David and his
posterity, down to the last Judean king Zedekiah, who was deprived of
his sovereignty by Nebuchadnezzar.

Then it was that God spake thus: "So long as the government rested in
the hands of My children, I was prepared to exercise patience. The
misdeeds of the one were made good by the other. If one of them was
wicked, the other was pious. But now that the dominions has been wrested
from My children, it shall at least revert to its original possessors.
Elam was the first-born son of Shem, and his seed shall be given the
rule." So it happened that Shushan, the capital city of Elam, became the
seat of government.

That there were any celebrations in Shushan was due to Haman, who even
in those early days was devising intrigues against the Jews. He appeared
before Ahasuerus, and said: "O king, this people is a peculiar people.
May it please thee to destroy it." Ahasuerus replied: "I fear the God of
this people; He is very mighty, and I bear in mind what befell Pharaoh
for his wicked treatment of the Israelites." "Their God," said Haman,
"hates an unchaste life. Do thou, therefore, prepare feasts for them,
and order them to take part in the merry-makings. Have them eat and
drink and act as their heart desireth, so that their God may become
wrathful against them."

When Mordecai heard of the feasts that were planned, he advised the Jews
not to join in them. All the prominent men of his people and many of the
lower classes took his advice to heart. They fled from Shushan, to avoid
being compelled to take part in the festivities. The rest remained in
the city and yielded to force; they participated in the celebrations,
and even permitted themselves to eat of food prepared by the heathen,
though the king had taken care not to offend the religious conscience of
the Jews in such details. He had been so punctilious that there was no
need for them to drink wine touched by the hand of an idolater, let
alone eat forbidden food. The arrangements for the feast were entirely
in the charge of Haman and Mordecai, so that neither Jew nor Gentile
might absent himself for religious reasons.

It was the aim of the king to let every guest follow the inclination of
his heart. When Ahasuerus issued the order, that the officers of his
house were to "do according to every man's pleasure," God became wroth
with him. "Thou villain," He said, "canst thou do every man's pleasure?
Suppose two men love the same woman, can both marry her? Two vessels
sail forth together from a port, the one desires a south wind, the other
a north wind. Canst thou produce a wind to satisfy the two? On the
morrow Haman and Mordecai will appear before thee. Wilt thou be able to
side with both?"

The scene of the festivities was in the royal gardens. The upper
branches of the high trees were made to interlace with each other, so as
to form vaulted arches, and the smaller trees with aromatic foliage were
taken up out of the ground, and placed in artfully constructed tents.
From tree to tree stretched curtains of byssus, white and sapphire blue,
and vivid green and royal purple, fastened to their supports by ropes
depending from round silver beams, these in turn resting on pillars of
red, green, yellow, white, and glittering blue marble. The couches were
made of delicate draperies, their frames stood on silver feet, and the
rods attached to them were of gold. The floor was tiled with crystal and
marble, outlined with precious stones, whose brilliance illuminated the
scene far and wide.

The wine and the other beverages were drunk only from golden vessels,
yet Ahasuerus was so rich that no drinking cup was used more than a
single time. But magnificent as these utensils of his were, when the
holy vessels of the Temple were brought in, the golden splendor of the
others was dimmed; it turned dull as lead. The wine was in each case
older than its drinker. To prevent intoxication from unaccustomed
drinks, every guest was served with the wine indigenous to his native
place. In general, Ahasuerus followed the Jewish rather than the Persian
manner. It was a banquet rather than a drinking bout. In Persia a custom
prevailed that every participant in a banquet of wine had to drain a
huge beaker far exceeding the drinking capacity of any human being, and
do it he must, though he lost reason and life. The office butler
accordingly was very lucrative, because the guests at such wassails were
in the habit of bribing him to purchase the liberty of drinking as
little as they pleased or dared. This Persian habit of compelling excess
in drinking was ignored at Ahasuerus's banquet; every guest did as he
chose.

The royal bounty did not show itself in food and drink alone. The king's
guests could also indulge in the pleasures of the dance if they were so
minded. Dancers were provided, who charmed the company with their
artistic figures displayed upon the purple-covered floor. That the
enjoyment of the participants might in no wise be marred, as by
separation from their families, all were permitted to bring their
households with them, and merchants were released from the taxes imposed
upon them.

So sure was Ahasuerus of his success as a host that he dared say to his
Jewish guests: "Will your God be able to match this banquet in the
future world?" Whereunto the Jews replied: "The banquet God will prepare
for the righteous in the world to come is that of which it is written,
'No eye hath seen it but God's; He will accomplish it for them that wait
upon Him.' If God were to offer us a banquet like unto thine, O king, we
should say, Such as this we ate at the table of Ahasuerus."

### VASTHI'S BANQUET

The banquet given by Queen Vashti to the women differed but slightly
from Ahasuerus's. She sought to emulate her husband's example even in
the point of exhibiting treasures. Six store-chambers she displayed
daily to the women she had bidden as guests; aye, she did not even
shrink from arraying herself in the high-priestly garments. The meats
and dishes, as at Ahasuerus's table, were Palestinian, only instead of
wine, liqueurs were served, and sweets.

As the weak sex is subject to sudden attacks of indisposition, the
banquet was given in the halls of the palace, so that the guests might
at need withdraw to the adjoining chambers. The gorgeously ornamented
apartments of the palace, besides, were more attractive to the feminine
taste than the natural beauties of the royal gardens, "for a woman would
rather reside in beautiful chambers and possess beautiful clothes than
eat fatted calves." Nothing interested the women more than to become
acquainted with the arrangement of the interior of the palace, "for
women are curious to know all things." Vashti gratified their desire.
She showed them all there was to be seen, describing every place as she
came to it: This is the dining-hall, this the wine-room, this the
bed-chamber.

Vashti, too, was actuated by a political motive when she determined to
give her banquet. By inviting the wives of hostages in case the men rose
in insurrection against the king. For Vashti knew the ways of
statecraft. She not only was the wife of a king, but also the daughter
of a king, of Belshazzar. The night of Belshazzar's murder in his own
palace, Vashti, alarmed by the confusion that ensued, and not knowing of
the death of her father, fled to the apartments in which he was in the
habit of sitting. The Median Darius had already ascended the throne of
Belshazzar, and so it happened that Vashti, instead of finding the
hoped-for refuge with her father, ran straight into the hands of his
successor. But he had compassion with her, and gave her to his son
Ahasuerus for wife.

### THE FATE OF VASHTI

Though Ahasuerus had taken every precaution to prevent intemperate
indulgence in wine, his banquet revealed the essential difference
between Jewish and pagan festivities. When Jews are gathered about a
festal board, they discuss a Halakah, or a Haggadah, or, at the least, a
simple verse from the Scriptures. Ahasuerus and his boon companions
rounded out the banquet with prurient talk. The Persians lauded the
charms of the women of their people, while the Medians admitted none
superior to the Median women. Then "the fool" Ahasuerus up and spake:
"My wife is neither a Persian nor a Median, but a Chaldean, yet she
excels all in beauty. Would you convince yourselves of the truth of my
words?" "Yes," shouted the company, who were deep in their cups, "but
that we may properly judge of her natural charms, let her appear before
us unadorned, yes, without any apparel whatsoever," and Ahasuerus agreed
to the shameless condition.

The thing was from God, that so insensate a demand should be made of
Vashti by the king. A whole week Mordecai had spent in fasting and
praying, supplicating God to mete out punishment to Ahasuerus for his
desecration of the Temple utensils. On the seventh day of the week, on
the Sabbath, when Mordecai after his long fast took food, because
fasting is forbidden on the Sabbath day, God heard his prayer and the
prayer of the Sanhedrin. He sent down seven Angels of Confusion to put
an end to Ahasuerus's pleasure. They were named: Mehuman, Confusion;
Biztha, Destruction of the House; Harbonah, Annihilation; Bigtha and
Abagtha, the Pressers of the Winepress, for God had resolved to crush
the court of Ahasuerus as one presses the juice from grapes in a press;
Zetha, Observer of Immorality; and Carcas, Knocker.

There was a particular reason why this interruption of the feast took
place on the Sabbath. Vashti was in the habit of forcing Jewish maidens
to spin and weave on the Sabbath day, and to add to her cruelty, she
would deprive them of all their clothes. It was on the Sabbath,
therefore, that her punishment overtook her, and for the same reason it
was put into the king's heart to have her appear in public stripped of
all clothing.

Vashti recoiled from the king's revolting order. But it must not be
supposed that she shrank from carrying it out because it offended her
moral sense. She was not a whit better than her husband. She fairly
revelled in the opportunity his command gave her to indulge in carnal
pleasures once again, for it was exactly a week since she had been
delivered of a child. But God sent the angel Gabriel to her to disfigure
her countenance. Suddenly signs of leprosy appeared on her forehead, and
the marks of other diseases on her person. In this state it was
impossible for her to show herself to the king. She made a virtue of
necessity, and worded her refusal to appear before him arrogantly: "Say
to Ahasuerus: 'O thou fool and madman! Hast thou lost thy reason by too
much drinking? I am Vashti, the daughter of Belshazzar, who was a son of
Nebuchadnezzar, the Nebuchadnezzar who scoffed at kings and unto whom
princes were a derision, and even thou wouldst not have been deemed
worthy to run before my father's chariot as a courier. Had he lived, I
should never have been given unto thee for wife. Not even those who
suffered the death penalty during the reign of my forefather
Nebuchadnezzar were stripped bare of their clothing, and thou demandest
that I appear naked in public! Why, it is for thine own sake that I
refuse to heed they order. Either the people will decide that I do not
come up to thy description of me, and will proclaim thee a liar, or,
bewitched by my beauty, they will kill thee in order to gain possession
of me, saying, Shall this fool be the master of so much beauty?'"

The first lady of the Persian aristocracy encouraged Vashti to adhere to
her resolution. "Better," her adviser said, when Ahasuerus's second
summons was delivered to Vashti, together with his threat to kill her
unless she obeyed, "better the king should kill thee and annihilate thy
beauty, than that thy person should be admired by other eyes than thy
husband's, and thus thy name be disgraced, and the name of thy
ancestors."

When Vashti refused to obey the repeated command to appear before the
king and the hundred and twenty-seven crowned princes of the realm,
Ahasuerus turned to the Jewish sages, and requested them to pass
sentence upon his queen. Their thoughts ran in this wise: If we condemn
the queen to death, we shall suffer for it as soon as Ahasuerus becomes
sober, and hears it was at our advice that she was executed. But if we
admonish him unto clemency now, while he is intoxicated, he will accuse
us of not paying due deference to the majesty of the king. They
therefore resolved upon neutrality. "Since the destruction of the
Temple," they said to the king, "since we have not dwelt in our land, we
have lost the power to give sage advice, particularly in matters of life
and death. Better seek counsel with the wise men of Ammon and Moab, who
have ever dwelt at ease in their land, like wine that hath settled on
its lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel.

Thereupon Ahasuerus put his charge against Vashti before the seven
princes of Persia, Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena,
and Memucan, who came from Africa, India, Edom, Tarsus, Mursa, Resen,
and Jerusalem, respectively. The names of these seven officials, each
representing his country, were indicative of their office. Carshena had
the care of the animals, Shethar of the wine, Admatha of the land,
Tarshish of the palace, Meres of the poultry, Marsena of the bakery, and
Memucan provided for the needs of all in the palace, his wife acting as
housekeeper.

This Memucan, a native of Jerusalem, was none other than Daniel, called
Memucan, "the appointed one," because he was designated by God to
perform miracles and bring about the death of Vashti.

When the king applied for advice to these seven nobles, Memucan was the
first to speak up, though in rank he was inferior to the other six, as
appears from the place his name occupies in the list. However, it is
customary, as well among Persians as among Jews, in passing death
sentence, to begin taking the vote with the youngest of the judges on
the bench, to prevent the juniors and the less prominent from being
overawed by the opinion of the more influential.

It was Memucan's advice to the king to make an example of Vashti, so
that in future no woman should dare refuse obedience to her husband.
Daniel-Memucan had had unpleasant experiences in his conjugal life. He
had married a wealthy Persian lady, who insisted upon speaking to him in
her own language exclusively. Besides, personal antipathy existed
between Daniel and Vashti. He had in a measure been the cause of her
refusal to appear before the king and his princes. Vashti hated Daniel,
because it was he who had prophesied his death to her father, and the
extinction of his dynasty. She could not endure his sight, wherefore she
would not show herself to the court in his presence. Also, it was Daniel
who, by pronouncing the Name of God, had caused the beauty of Vashti to
vanish, and her face to be marred. In consequence of all this, Daniel
advised, not only that Vashti should be cast off, but that she should be
made harmless forever by the hangman's hand. His advice was endorsed by
his colleagues, and approved by the king. That the king might not delay
execution of the death sentence, and Daniel himself thus incur danger to
his own life, he made Ahasuerus swear the most solemn oath known to the
Persians, that it would be carried out forthwith. At the same time a
royal edict was promulgated, making it the duty of wives to obey their
husbands. With special reference to Daniel's domestic difficulties, it
was specified that the wife must speak the language of her lord and
master.

The execution of Vashti brought most disastrous consequences in its
train. His whole empire, which is tantamount to saying the whole world,
rose against Ahasuerus. The widespread rebellion was put down only after
his marriage with Esther, but not before it had inflicted upon him the
loss of one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, the half of his kingdom.
Such was his punishment for refusing permission to rebuild the Temple.
It was only after the fall of Haman, when Mordecai had been made the
chancellor of the empire, that Ahasuerus succeeded in reducing the
revolted provinces to submission.

The death of Vashti was not undeserved punishment, for it had been she
who had prevented the king from giving his consent to the rebuilding of
the Temple. "Wilt thou rebuild the Temple," said she, reproachfully,
"which my ancestors destroyed?"

### THE FOLLIES OF AHASUERUS

Ahasuerus is the prototype of the unstable, foolish ruler. He sacrificed
his wife Vashti to his friend Haman-Memucan, and later on again his
friend Haman to his wife Esther. Folly possessed him, too, when he
arranged extravagant festivities for guests from afar, before he had
won, by means of kindly treatment, the friendship of his surroundings,
of the inhabitants of his capital. Ridiculous is the word that describes
his edict bidding wives obey their husbands. Every one who read it
exclaimed: "To be sure, a man is master in his own house!" However, the
silly decree served its purpose. It revealed his true character to the
subjects of Ahasuerus, and thenceforward they attached little importance
to his edicts. This was the reason why the decree of annihilation
directed against the Jews failed of the effect expected by Haman and
Ahasuerus. The people regarded it as but another of the king's foolish
pranks, and therefore were ready to acquiesce in the revocation of the
edict when it came.

The king's true character appeared when he grew sober after the episode
with Vashti. Learning that he had had her executed, he burst out
furiously against his seven counsellors, and in turn ordered them to
death.

Foolish, too, is the only word to describe the manner in which he set
about discovering the most beautiful woman in his dominion. King David
on a similar occasion wisely sent out messengers who were to bring to
him the most beautiful maiden in the land, and there was none who was
not eager to enjoy the honor of giving a daughter of his to the king.
Ahasuerus's method was to have his servants gather together a multitude
of beautiful maidens and women from all parts, and among them he
proposed to make choice. The result of this system was that the women
concealed themselves to avoid being taken into the harem of the king,
when it was not certain that they would be found worthy of becoming his
queen.

With his stupidity Ahasuerus combined wantonness. He ordered force to be
used in taking the maidens from their parents and the wives from their
husbands, and then he confined them in his harem. On the other hand, the
moral sense of the heathen was so degraded that many maidens displayed
their charms to public view, so that they might be sure to attract the
admiring attention of the royal emissaries.

As for Esther, for four years Mordecai kept her concealed in a chamber,
so that the king's scouts could not discover her. But her beauty had
long been known to fame, and when they returned to Shushan, they had to
confess to the king, that the most superbly beautiful woman in the land
eluded their search. Thereupon Ahasuerus issued a decree ordaining the
death penalty for the woman who should secrete herself before his
emissaries. There was nothing left for Mordecai to do but fetch Esther
from her hiding-place, and immediately she was espied and carried to the
palace of the king.

### MORDECAI

The descent of Mordecai and of his niece Esther is disposed of in a few
words in the Scripture. But he could trace it all the way back to the
Patriarch Jacob, from whom he was forty-five degrees removed. Beside the
father of Mordecai, the only ancestor of his who is mentioned by name is
Shimei, and he is mentioned for a specific reason. This Shimei is none
other then the notorious son of Gera, the rebel who had so scoffed and
mocked at David fleeing before Absalom that he would have been killed by
Abishai, if David had not generously interfered in his favor. David's
prophetic eye discerned in Shimei the ancestor of Israel's savior in the
time of Ahasuerus. For this reason he dealt leniently with him, and on
his death-bed he bade his son Solomon reserve vengeance until Shimei
should have reached old age and could beget no more children. Thus
Mordecai deserves both appellations, the Benjamite and the Judean, for
he owed his existence not only to his actual Benjamite forebears on his
father's side, but also to the Judean David, who kept his ancestor
Shimei alive.

Shimei's distinction as the ancestor of Israel's redeemer was due to the
merits of his wife. When Jonathan and Ahimaaz, David's spies in his war
against his son, fled before the myrmidons of Absalom, they found the
gate of Shimei's house open. Entering, they concealed themselves in the
well. That they escaped detection was due to the ruse of Shimei's pious
wife. She quickly transformed the well into a lady's chamber. When
Absalom's men came and looked about, they desisted from searching the
place, because they reasoned, that men as saintly as Jonathan and
Ahimaaz would not have taken refuge in the private apartment of a woman.
God determined, that for having rescued two pious men He would reward
her with two pious descendants, who should in turn avert the ruin of
Israel.

On his mother's side, Mordecai was, in very deed, a member of the tribe
of Judah. In any event, he was a son of Judah in the true sense of the
word; he publicly acknowledged himself a Jew, and he refused to touch of
the forbidden food which Ahasuerus set before his guest at his banquet.

His other appellatives likewise point to his piety and his excellencies.
His name Mordecai, for instance, consists of Mor, meaning "myrrh," and
Decai, "pure," for he was as refined and noble as pure myrrh. Again, he
is called Ben Jair, because he "illumined the eyes of Israel"; and Ben
Kish, because when he knocked at the gates of the Divine mercy, they
were opened unto him, which is likewise the origin of his name Ben
Shimei, for he was heard by God when he offered up prayer. Still another
of Mordecai's epithets was Bilshan, "master of languages." Being a
member of the great Sanhedrin he understood all the seventy languages
spoken in the world. More than that, he knew the language of the deaf
mutes. It once happened that no new grain could be obtained at Passover
time. A deaf mute came and pointed with one hand to the roof and with
the other to the cottage. Mordecai understood that these signs meant a
locality by the name of Gagot-Zerifim, Cottage-Roofs, and, lo, new grain
was found there for the 'Omer offering. On another occasion a deaf mute
pointed with one hand to his eye and with the other to the staple of the
bolt on the door. Mordecai understood that he meant a place called
En-Soker, "dry well," for eye and spring are the same word, En, in
Aramaic, and Sikra also has a double meaning, staple and exhaustion.

Mordecai belonged to the highest aristocracy of Jerusalem, he was of
royal blood, and he was deported to Babylonian together with King
Jeconiah, by Nebuchadnezzar, who at that time exiled only the great of
the land. Later he returned to Palestine, but remained only for a time.
He preferred to live in the Diaspora, and watch over the education of
Esther. When Cyrus and Darius captured Babylon, Mordecai, Daniel, and
the Jewish community of the conquered city accompanied King Cyrus to
Shushan, where Mordecai established his academy.

### ESTHER'S BEAUTY AND PIETY

The birth of Esther caused the death of her mother. Her father had died
a little while before, so she was entirely orphaned. Mordecai and his
wife interested themselves in the poor babe. His wife became her nurse,
and he himself did not hesitate, when there was need for it, to do
services for the child that are usually performed only by women.

Both her names, Esther as well as Hadassah, are descriptive of her
virtues. Hadassah, or Myrtle, she is called, because her good deeds
spread her fame abroad, as the sweet fragrance of the myrtle pervades
the air in which it grows. In general, the myrtle is symbolic of the
pious, because, as the myrtle is ever green, summer and winter alike, so
the saints never suffer dishonor, either in this world or in the world
to come. In another way Esther resembled the myrtle, which, in spite of
its pleasant scent, has a bitter taste. Esther was pleasant to the Jews,
but bitterness itself to Haman and all who belonged to him.

The name Esther is equally significant. In Hebrew it means "she who
conceals," a fitting name for the niece of Mordecai, the woman who well
knew how to guard a secret, and long hid her descent and faith from the
king and the court. She herself had been kept concealed for years in the
house of her uncle, withdrawn from the searching eyes of the king's
spies. Above all she was the hidden light that suddenly shone upon
Israel in his rayless darkness.

In build, Esther was neither tall nor short, she was exactly of average
height, another reason for calling her Myrtle, a plant which likewise is
neither large nor small. In point of fact, Esther was not a beauty in
the real sense of the word. The beholder was bewitched by her grace and
her charm, and that in spite of her somewhat sallow, myrtle-like
complexion. More than this, her enchanting grace was not the grace of
youth, for she was seventy-five years old when she came to court, and
captivated the hearts of all who saw her, from king to eunuch. This was
in fulfilment of the prophecy which God made to Abraham when he was
leaving the home of his father: "Thou art leaving the house of thy
father at the age of seventy-five. As thou livest, the deliverer of thy
children in Media also shall be seventy-five years old."

Another historical event pointed forward to Esther's achievement. When
the Jews, after the destruction of Jerusalem, broke out into the wail,
"We are orphans and fatherless," God said: "in very sooth, the redeemer
whom I shall send unto you in Media shall also be an orphan fatherless
and motherless."

Ahasuerus put Esther between two groups of beauties, Median beauties to
right of her, and Persian beauties to left of her. Yet Esther's
comeliness outshone them all. Not even Joseph could vie with the Jewish
queen in grace. Grace was suspended above him, but Esther was fairly
laden down with it. Whoever saw her, pronounced her the ideal of beauty
of his nation. The general exclamation was: "This one is worthy of being
queen." In vain Ahasuerus had sought a wife for four years, in vain
fathers had spent time and money bringing their daughters to him, in the
hope that one or the other would appeal to his fancy. None among the
maidens, none among the women, pleased Ahasuerus. But scarcely had he
set eyes upon Esther when he thrilled with the feeling, that he had at
last found what he had long yearned for.

All these years the portrait of Vashti had hung in his chamber. He had
not forgotten his rejected queen. But once he beheld Esther, Vashti's
picture was replaced by hers. Maiden grace and womanly charm were in her
united.

The change in her worldly position wrought no change in Esther's ways
and manners. As she retained her beauty until old age, so the queen
remained as pure in mind and soul as ever the simple maiden had been.
All the other women who entered the gates of the royal palace made
exaggerated demands, Esther's demeanor continued modest and unassuming.
The others insisted that the seven girl pages assigned to them should
have certain peculiar qualities, as, that they should not differ, each
from her mistress, in complexion and height. Esther uttered no wish
whatsoever.

But her unpretending ways were far from pleasing to Hegai, chief of the
eunuchs of the harem. He feared lest the king discover that Esther did
nothing to preserve her beauty, and would put the blame for it upon him,
an accusation that might bring him to the gallows. To avoid such a fate,
he loaded Esther down with resplendent jewels, distinguishing her beyond
all the other women gathered in the palace, as Joseph, by means of
costly gifts lavished upon him, had singled out her ancestor Benjamin
from among his brethren.

Hegai paid particular attention to what Esther ate. For her he brought
dishes from the royal table, which, however, she refused obstinately to
ouch. Only such things passed her lips as were permitted to Jews. She
lived entirely on vegetable food, as Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah had
aforetimes done at the court of Nebuchadnezzar. The forbidden tidbits
she passed over to the non-Jewish servants. Her personal attendants were
seven Jewish maidens as consistently pious as herself, whose devotion to
the ritual law Esther could depend upon.

Otherwise Esther was cut off from all intercourse with Jews, and she was
in danger of forgetting when the Sabbath bath came around. She therefore
adopted the device of giving her seven attendants peculiar names, to
keep her in mind of the passage of time. The first one was called Hulta,
"Workaday," and she was in attendance upon Esther on Sundays. On
Mondays, she was served by Rok\`ita, to remind her of Rek\`ia, "the
Firmament," which was created on the second day of the world. Tuesday's
maid was called Genunita, "Garden," the third day of creation having
produced the world of plants. On Wednesday, she was reminded by
Nehorita's name, "the Luminous," that it was the day on which God had
made the great luminaries, to shed their light in the sky; on Thursday
by Ruhshita, "Movement," for on the fifth day the first animated beings
were created; on Friday, the day on which the beasts came into being, by
Hurfita, "little Ewelamb"; and on the Sabbath her bidding was done by
Rego\`ita, "Rest." Thus she was sure to remember the Sabbath day week
after week.

Mordecai's daily visits to the gate of the palace had a similar purpose.
Thus Esther was afforded the opportunity of obtaining instruction from
him on all ritual doubts that might assail her. This lively interest
displayed by Mordecai in Esther's physical and spiritual welfare is not
wholly attributable to an uncle's and guardian's solicitude in behalf of
an orphaned niece. A much closer bond, the bond between husband and
wife, united them, for when Esther had grown to maidenhood, Mordecai had
espoused her. Naturally, Esther would have been ready to defend her
conjugal honor with her life. She would gladly have suffered death at
the hands of the king's bailiffs rather than yield herself to a man not
her husband. Luckily, there was no need for this sacrifice, for her
marriage with Ahasuerus was but a feigned union. God has sent down a
female spirit in the guise of Esther to take her place with the king.
Esther herself never lived with Ahasuerus as his wife.

At the advice of her uncle, Esther kept her descent and her faith a
secret. Mordecai's injunction was dictated by several motives. First of
all it was his modesty that suggested secrecy. He thought the king, if
he heard from Esther that she had been raised by him, might offer to
install him in some high office. In point of fact, Mordecai was right in
his conjecture; Ahasuerus had pledged himself to make lords, princes,
and kings of Esther's friends and kinspeople, if she would but name
them.

Another reason for keeping Esther's Jewish affiliations a secret was
Mordecai's apprehension, that the fate of Vashti overtake Esther, too.
If such were in store for her, he desired at least to guard against the
Jews' becoming her fellowsuffers. Besides, Mordecai knew only too well
the inimical feelings entertained by the heathen toward the Jews, ever
since their exile from the Holy Land, and he feared that the Jew-haters,
to gratify their hostility against the Jews, might bring about the ruin
of Esther and her house.

Mindful of the perils to which Esther was exposed, Mordecai allowed no
day to pass without assuring himself of her well-being. His compensation
therefore came from God: "Thou makest the well-being of a single soul
they intimate concern. As thou livest, the well-being and good of thy
whole nation Israel shall be entrusted to thee as thy task." And to
reward him for his modesty, God said: "Thou withdrawest thyself from
greatness; as thou livest, I will honor thee more than all men on
earth."

Vain were the efforts made by Ahasuerus to draw her secret from Esther.
He arranged great festivities for the purpose, but she guarded it well.
She had an answer ready for his most insistent questions: "I know
neither my people nor my family, for I lost my parents in my earliest
infancy." But as the king desired greatly to show himself gracious to
the nation to which the queen belonged, he released all the peoples
under his dominion from the payment of taxes and imposts. In this way,
he thought, her nation was bound to be benefited.

When the king saw that kindness and generosity left her untouched, he
sought to wrest the secret from her by threats. Once when she parried
his inquiries in the customary way, saying, "I am an orphan, and God,
the Father of the fatherless, in His mercy, has brought me up," he
retorted: I shall gather virgins together the second time." His purpose
was to provoke the jealousy of Esther, "for a woman is jealous of
nothing so much as a rival."

When Mordecai noticed that women were being brought to court anew, he
was overcome with anxiety for his niece. Thinking that the fate of
Vashti might have befallen her, he was impelled to make inquires about
her.

As for Esther herself, she was but following the example of her race.
She could keep silent in all modesty, as Rachel, the mother of Benjamin,
had kept a modest silence when her father gave her sister Leah to Jacob
for wife instead of herself, and as Saul the Benjamite was modestly
reserved when, questioned by his uncle, he told about the finding of his
she-asses, but nothing about his elevation to the kingship. Rachel and
Saul were recompensed for their self-abnegation by being given a
descendant like Esther.

### THE CONSPIRACY

Once the following conversation took place between Ahasuerus and Esther.
The king asked Esther: "Whose daughter art thou?"

Esther: "And whose son art thou?"

Ahasuerus: "I am a king, and the son of a king."

Esther: "And I am a queen, the daughter of kings, a descendant of the
royal family of Saul. If thou art, indeed, a real prince, how couldst
thou put Vashti to death?"

Ahasuerus: "It was not to gratify my own wish, but at the advice of the
great princes of Persia and Media."

Esther: "Thy predecessors took no advice from ordinary intelligences;
they were guided by prophetical counsel. Arioch brought Daniel to
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and Belshazzar, too, summoned Daniel
before him."

Ahasuerus: "Is there aught left of those toothsome morsels? Are there
still prophets abroad?

Esther: "Seek and thou wilt find."

The result was that Mordecai was given the position at court once
occupied by the chamberlains Bigthan and Teresh. Indignant that a place
once filled by senators should be given to a barbarian, the ousted
officials resolved to be revenged upon the king and take his life. Their
purpose was to administer poison, which seemed easy of accomplishment,
as they were the royal butlers, and could find many occasions to drop
poison into a cup of water before handing it to the king. The plan
successfully carried out would have satisfied their vengeful feelings,
not only as to the king, but as to Mordecai as well. It would have made
it appear that the death of Ahasuerus was attributable to the
circumstance, that he had entrusted his person to the care of the Jew,
as his life had been secure under Bigthan and Teresh. They discussed
their plans in the presence of Mordecai, acting upon the unwarranted
assumption, that he would not understand the language they spoke, the
Tarsian, their native tongue. They were ignorant of the fact, that
Mordecai was a member of the Sanhedrin, and as such knew all the seventy
languages of the world. Thus their own tongue betrayed them to ruin.

However, Mordecai had no need to make use of his great knowledge of
languages; he obtained his information about the plot of the two
chamberlains through prophetical channels. Accordingly, he appeared one
night in the palace. By a miracle the guards at the gates had not seen
him, and he could enter unrestrained. Thus he overheard the conversation
between the two conspirators.

Mordecai had more than a single reason for preventing the death of
Ahasuerus. In the first place, he desired to secure the king's
friendship for the Jews, and more especially his permission for the
rebuilding of the Temple. Then he feared, if the king were murdered
immediately after his rise to a high place in the state, the heathen
would assign as the cause of the disaster his connection with the Jews
his marriage with Esther and the appointment of Mordecai to office.

Esther's confidence in Mordecai's piety was so great that she
unhesitatingly gave credence to the message she received from him
concerning the mischievous plot hatched against the king. She believed
that God would execute the wishes of Mordecai. Albeit Bigthan and Teresh
had no plans of the sort attributed to them by her uncle, they would
conceive then now in order to make Mordecai's words true. That Esther's
confidence was justified appeared at once. The conspirators got wind of
their betrayal to the king, and in good time they removed the poison
they had already placed in Ahasuerus's cup. But that the lie might not
be given to Mordecai, God caused poison to appear where none had been,
and the conspirators were convicted of their crime. The king had the
water analyzed which he was given to drink, and it was made manifest
that it contained poison. Other evidence besides existed against the two
plotters. It was established that both had at the same time busied
themselves about the person of the king, though the regulations of the
palace assigned definite hours of service to the one different from
those assigned to the other. This made it clear that they intended to
perpetrate a dark deed in common.

The two conspirators sought to escape the legitimate punishment for
their dastardly deed by ending their own life. But their intention was
frustrated, and they were nailed to the cross.

### HAMAN THE JEW-BAITER

The conspiracy of Bigthan and Teresh determined the king never again to
have two chamberlains guard his person. Henceforward he would entrust
his safety to a single individual, and he appointed Haman to the place.
This was an act of ingratitude toward Mordecai, who, as the king's
savior, had the most cogent claims upon the post. But Haman possessed
one important advantage, he was the owner of great wealth. With the
exception of Korah he was the richest man that had ever lived, for he
had appropriated to himself the treasures of the Judean kings and of the
Temple.

Ahasuerus had an additional reason for distinguishing Haman. He was well
aware of Mordecai's ardent desire to see the Temple restored, and he
instinctively felt he could not deny the wish of the man who had
snatched him from untimely death. Yet he was not prepared to grant it.
To escape from the dilemma he endeavored to make Haman act as a
counterpoise against Mordecai, that "what the one built up, the other
might pull down."

Ahasuerus had long been acquainted with Haman's feeling against the
Jews. When the quarrel about the rebuilding of the Temple broke out
between the Jews and their heathen adversaries, and the sons of Haman
denounced the Jews before Ahasuerus, the two parties at odds agreed to
send each a representative to the king, to advocate his case. Mordecai
was appointed the Jewish delegate, and no more rabid Jew-hater could be
found than Haman, to plead the cause of the antagonists of the Temple
builders.

As for his character, that, too, King Ahasuerus had had occasion to see
in its true light, because Haman is but another name for Memucan, the
prince who is chargeable in the last resort with the death of Vashti. At
the time of the king's wrath against the queen, Memucan was still lowest
in the rank among the seven princes of Persia, yet, arrogant as he was,
he was the first to speak up when the king put his question about the
punishment due to Vashti an illustration of the popular adage: "The
common man rushes to the front." Haman's hostility toward Vashti dated
from her banquet, to which the queen had failed to bid his wife as
guest. Moreover, she had once insulted him by striking him a blow in the
face. Besides, Haman calculated, if only Vashti's repudiation could be
brought about, he might succeed in marrying his own daughter to the
king. He was not the only disappointed man at court. In part the
conspiracy of Bigthan and Teresh was a measure of revenge against
Ahasuerus for having made choice of Esther instead of a kinswoman of
theirs.

Esther once married to the king, however, Haman made the best of a bad
bargain. He tried by every means in his power to win the friendship of
the queen. Whether she was Jewess or heathen, he desired to claim
kinship with her as a Jewess through the fraternal bond between Esau and
Jacob, as a heathen easily enough, "for all the heathen area akin to one
another."

### MORDECAI'S PRIDE

When Ahasuerus raised Haman to his high office, he at the same time
issued the order, that all who saw him were to prostrate themselves
before him and pay him Divine honors. To make it manifest that the
homage due to him had an idolatrous character, Haman had the image of an
idol fastened to his clothes, so that whoever bowed down before him,
worshipped an idol at the same time. Mordecai alone of all at court
refused to obey the royal order. The highest officials, even the most
exalted judges, showed Haman the reverence bidden by the king. The Jews
themselves entreated Mordecai not to call forth the fury of Haman, and
cause the ruin of Israel thereby. Mordecai, however, remained steadfast;
no persuasions could move him to pay to a mortal the tribute due to
Divinity.

Also the servants of the king who sat at the gate of the royal palace
said to Mordecai: "Wherein art thou better than we, that we should pay
reverence to Haman and prostrate ourselves, and thou doest naught of all
commanded us in the matter?" Mordecai answered, saying "O ye fools
without understanding! Hear ye my words and make meet reply thereunto.
Who is man that he should act proudly and arrogantly man born of woman
and few in days? At his birth there is weeping and travailing, in his
youth pain and groans, all his days are 'full of trouble,' and in the
end he returns unto dust. Before such an one I should prostrate myself?
I bend the knee before God alone, the only living One in heaven, He who
is the fire consuming all other fires; who holds the earth in His arms;
who stretches out the heavens in His might; who darkens the sun when it
pleases Him, and illumines the darkness; who commanded the sand to set
bounds unto the seas; who made the waters of the sea salt, and caused
its waves to spread an aroma as of wine; who chained the sea as with
manacles, and held it fast in the depths of the abyss that it might not
overflow the land; it rages, yet it cannot pass its limits. With His
word He created the firmament, which He stretched out like a cloud in
the air; He cast it over the world like a dark vault, like a tent it is
spread over the earth. In His strength He upholds all there is above and
below. The sun, the moon, and the Pleiades run before Him, the stars and
the planets are not idle for a single moment; they rest not, they speed
before Him as His messengers, going to the right and to the left, to do
the will of Him who created them. To Him praise is due, before Him we
must prostrate ourselves."

The court officials spake and said: "Yet we know well that thy ancestor
Jacob prostrated himself before Haman's ancestor Esau!"

Whereunto Mordecai made reply: "I am a descendant of Benjamin, who was
not yet born when his father Jacob and his brothers cast themselves upon
the earth before Esau. My ancestor never showed such honor to a mortal.
Therefore was Benjamin's allotment of land in Palestine privileged to
contain the Temple. The spot whereon Israel and all the peoples of the
earth prostrated themselves before God belonged to him who had never
prostrated himself before mortal man. Therefore I will not bend my knee
before this sinner Haman, nor cast myself to earth before him."

Haman at first tried to propitiate Mordecai by a show of modesty. As
though he had not noticed the behavior of Mordecai, he approached him,
and saluted him with the words: "Peace be with thee, my lord!" But
Mordecai bluntly replied: "There is no peace, saith my God, to the
wicked."

The hatred of Mordecai cherished by Haman was due to more than the
hereditary enmity between the descendants of Saul and Agag. Not even
Mordecai's public refusal to pay the homage due to Haman suffices to
explain its virulence. Mordecai was aware of a certain incident in the
past of Haman. If he had divulged it, the betrayal would have been most
painful to the latter. This accounts for the intensity of his feeling.

It once happened that a city in India rebelled against Ahasuerus. In
great haste troops were dispatched thither under the command of Mordecai
and Haman. It was estimated that the campaign would require three years,
and all preparations were made accordingly. By the end of the first year
Haman had squandered the provisions laid in to supply the part of the
army commanded by him, for the whole term of the campaign. Greatly
embarrassed, he requested Mordecai to give him aid. Mordecai, however,
refused him succor; they both had been granted the same amount of
provisions for an equal number of men. Haman then offered to borrow from
Mordecai and pay him interest. This, too, Mordecai refused to do, and
for two reasons. If Mordecai had supplied Haman's men with provisions,
his own would have to suffer, and as for interest, the law prohibits it,
saying "Unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury," and Jacob and
Esau, the respective ancestors of Mordecai and Haman, had been brothers.

When starvation stared them in the face, the troops commanded by Haman
threatened him with death unless he gave them their rations. Haman again
resorted to Mordecai, and promised to pay him as much as ten per cent
interest. The Jewish general continued to refuse the offer. But he
professed himself willing to help him out of his embarrassment on one
condition, that Haman sell himself to Mordecai as his slave. Driven into
a corner, he acquiesced, and the contract was written upon Mordecai's
knee-cap, because there was no paper to be found in the camp.

The bill of sale ran thus: "I, Haman, the son of Hammedatha of the
family of Agag, was sent out by King Ahasuerus to make war upon an
Indian city, with an army of sixty thousand soldiers, furnished with the
necessary provisions. Precisely the same commission was given by the
king to Mordecai, the son of Shimei of the tribe of Benjamin. But I
squandered the provisions entrusted to me by the king, so that I had no
rations to give to my troops. I desired to borrow from Mordecai on
interest, but, having regard to the fact that Jacob and Esau were
brothers, he refused to lend me upon usury, and I was forced to sell
myself as slave to him. If, now, I should at any time decline to serve
him as a slave, or deny that I am his slave, or if my children and
children's children unto the end of all time should refuse to do him
service, if only a single day of the week; or if I should act inimically
toward him on account of this contract, as Esau did toward Jacob after
selling him his birthright; in all these cases, a beam of wood is to be
plucked out of the house of the recalcitrant, and he is to be hanged
upon it. I, Haman, the son of Hammedatha of the family of Agag, being
under no restraint, do hereby consent with my own will, and bind myself
to be slave in perpetuity to Mordecai, in accordance with the contents
of this document."

Later, when Haman attained to high rank in the state, Mordecai, whenever
he met him, was in the habit of stretching out his knee toward him, so
that he might see the bill of sale. This so enraged him against Mordecai
and against the Jews that he resolved to extirpate the Jewish people.

### CASTING THE LOTS

Haman's hatred, first directed against Mordecai alone, grew apace until
it included Mordecai's colleagues, all the scholars, whom he sought to
destroy, and not satisfied with even this, he plotted the annihilation
of the whole of Mordecai's people, the Jews.

Before beginning to lay out his plans, he desired to determine the most
favorable moment for his undertaking, which he did by casting lots.

First of all he wanted to decide on the day of the week. The scribe
Shimshai began to cast lots. Sunday appeared inappropriate, being the
day on which God created heaven and earth, whose continuance depends on
Israel's existence. Were it not for God's covenant with Israel, there
would be neither day nor night, neither heaven nor earth. Monday showed
itself equally unpropitious for Haman's devices, for it was the day on
which God effected the separation between the celestial and the
terrestrial waters, symbolic of the separation between Israel and the
heathen. Tuesday, the day on which the vegetable world was created,
refused to give its aid in bringing about the ruin of Israel, who
worships God with branches of palm trees. Wednesday, too, protested
against the annihilation of Israel, saying: "On me the celestial
luminaries were created, and like unto them Israel is appointed to
illumine the whole world. First destroy me, and then Thou mayest destroy
Israel." Thursday said: "O Lord, on me the birds were created, which are
used for sin offerings. When Israel shall be no more, who will bring
offerings? First destroy me, and then Thou mayest destroy Israel."
Friday was unfavorable to Haman's lots, because it was the day of the
creation of man, and the Lord God said to Israel, "Ye are men." Least of
all was the Sabbath day inclined to make itself subservient to Haman's
wicked plans. It said: "The Sabbath is a sign between Israel and God.
First destroy me, and then Thou mayest destroy Israel!"

Baffled, Haman gave up all idea of settling upon a favorable day of the
week. He applied himself to the task of searching out the suitable month
for his sinister undertaking. As it appeared to him, Adar was the only
one of the twelve owning naught that might be interpreted in favor of
the Jews. The rest of them seemed to be enlisted on their side. In Nisan
Israel was redeemed from Egypt; in Iyar Amlek was overcome; In Siwan the
Ethiopian Zerah was smitten in the war with Asa; in Tammuz the Amorite
kings were subjugated; in Ab the Jews won a victory over Arad, the
Canaanite; in Tishri the Jewish kingdom was firmly established by the
dedication of Solomon's Temple, while in Heshwan the building of the
Temple at Jerusalem was completed; Kislew and Tebet were the months
during which Sihon and Og were conquered by the Israelites, and in
Shebat occurred the sanguinary campaign of the eleven tribes against the
godless children of Benjamin. Not alone was Adar a month without
favorable significance in Jewish history, but actually a month of
misfortune, the month in which Moses died. What Haman did not know was,
that Adar was the month in which occurred also the birth of Moses.

Then Haman investigated the twelve signs of the zodiac in relation to
Israel, and again it appeared that Adar was the most unfavorable month
for the Jews. The first constellation, the Ram, said to Haman, "'Israel
is a scattered sheep,' and how canst thou expect a father to offer his
son for slaughter?"

The Bull said: "Israel's ancestor was 'the firstling bullock.'"

The Twins: "As we are twins, so Tamar bore twins to Judah."

The Crab: "As I am called Saratan, the scratcher, so it is said of
Israel, 'All that oppress him, he shall scratch sorely.'"

The Lion: "God is called the lion, and is it likely the lion will permit
the fox to bite his children?"

The Virgin: "As I am a virgin, so Israel is compared unto a virgin."

The Balance: "Israel obeys the law against unjust balances in the Torah,
and must therefore be protected by the Balance."

The Scorpion: "Israel is like unto me, for he, too, is called scorpion."

The Archer: "The sons of Judah are masters of the bow, and the bows of
mighty men directed against them will be broken."

The Goat: "It was a goat that brought blessing unto Jacob, the ancestor
of Israel, and it stands to reason that the blessing of the ancestor
cannot cause misfortune to the descendant."

The Water-bearer: "His dominion is likened unto a bucket, and therefore
the Water-bearer cannot but bring him good."

The Fishes were the only constellation which, at least according to
Haman's interpretation, made unfavorable prognostications as to the fate
of the Jews. It said that the Jews would be swallowed like fishes. God
however spake: "O thou villain! Fishes are sometimes swallowed, but
sometimes they swallow, and thou shalt be swallowed by the swallowers."
And when Haman began to cast lots, God said: "O thou villain, son of a
villain! What thy lots have shown thee is thine own lot, that thou wilt
be hanged."

### THE DENUNCIATION OF THE JEWS

His resolve to ruin the Jews taken, Haman appeared before Ahasuerus with
his accusation against them. "There is a certain people," he said, "the
Jews, scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the
provinces of the kingdom. They are proud and presumptuous. In Tebet, in
the depth of winter, they bathe in warm water, and they sit in cold
water in summer. Their religion is diverse from the religion of every
other people, and their laws from the laws of every other land. To our
laws they pay no heed, our religion finds no favor with them, and the
decrees of the king they do not execute. When their eye falls upon us,
they spit out before us, and they consider us as unclean vessels. When
we levy them for the king's service, they either jump upon the wall, and
hide within the chambers, or they break through the walls and escape. If
we hasten to arrest them, they turn upon us, glare at us with their
eyes, grind their teeth, stamp their feet, and so intimidate us that we
cannot hold them fast. They do not give us their daughters unto wives,
nor do they take our daughters unto wives. If one of them has to do the
king's service, he idles all the day long. If they want to buy aught of
us, they say, 'This is a day for doing business.' But if we want to buy
aught of them, they say, 'We may do no business to-day,' and thus we can
buy nothing from them on their market-days.

"Their time they pass in this wise: The first hour of the day, they say,
they need for reciting the Shema; the second for praying; the third for
eating; the fourth for saying grace, to give thanks to God for the food
and drink He has granted them; the fifth hour they devote to their
business affairs; in the sixth they already feel the need of rest; in
the seventh their wives call for them, saying, 'come home, ye weary
ones, who are so exhausted by the king's service!'

"The seventh day they celebrate as their Sabbath; they go to the
synagogues on that day, read out of their books, translate pieces from
their Prophets, curse our king, and execrate our government, saying:
'This is the day whereon the great God rested; so may He grant us rest
from the heathen.'

"The women pollute the waters with their ritual baths, which they take
after the seven days of their defilement. On the eighth day after the
birth of sons, they circumcise them mercilessly, saying, 'This shall
distinguish us from all other nations.' At the end of thirty days, and
sometimes twenty-nine, they celebrate the beginning of the month. In the
month of Nisan they observe eight days of Passover, beginning the
celebration by kindling a fire of brushwood to burn up the leaven. They
put all the leaven in their homes out of sight before they use the
unleavened bread, saying, 'This is the day whereon our fathers were
redeemed from Egypt.' Such is the festival they call Pesah. They go to
their synagogues, read out of their books, and translate from the
writings of the Prophets, saying: 'As the leaven has been removed out of
our houses, so may this wicked dominion be removed from over us.'

"Again, in Siwan, they celebrate two days, on which they go to their
synagogues, recite the Shema, and offer up prayers, read out of the
Torah, and translate from the books of their Prophets, curse our king,
and execrate our government. This is the holiday which they call Azarta,
the closing festival. They ascend to the roofs of their synagogues, and
throw down apples, which are picked up by those below, with the words,
'As these apples are gathered up, so may we be gathered together from
our dispersion among the heathen.' They say they observe this festival,
because on these days the Torah was revealed to their ancestors on Mount
Sinai.

"On the first of Tishri they celebrate the New Year again they go to
their synagogues, read out of their books, translate pieces from the
writings of their Prophets, curse our king, execrate our government, and
blow the trumpets, saying: 'On this Day of Memorial may we be remembered
unto good, and our enemies unto evil.'

"On the ninth day of the same month they slaughter cattle, geese, and
poultry, they eat and drink and indulge in dainties, they and their
wives, their sons and their daughters. But the tenth day of the same
month they call the Great Fast, and all of them fast, they together with
their wives, their sons, and their daughters, yea, they even torture
their little children without mercy, forcing them to abstain from food.
They say: 'On this day our sins are pardoned, and are added to the sum
of the sins committed by our enemies.' They go to their synagogues, read
from their books, translate from the writings of their Prophets, curse
our king, and execrate our government, saying: 'May this empire be wiped
off from the face of the earth like unto our sins.' They supplicate and
pray that the king may die, and his rule be made to cease.

"On the fifteenth of the same month they celebrate the Feast of
Tabernacles. They cover the roofs of their houses with foliage, they
resort to our parks, where they cut down palm branches for their festal
wreaths, pluck the fruit of the Etrog, and cause havoc among the willows
of the brook, by breaking down the hedges in their quest after
Hosha'not, saying: 'As does the king in the triumphal procession, so do
we.' Then they repair to their synagogues to pray, and read out of their
books, and make circuits with their Hosha'not, all the while jumping and
skipping like goats, so that there is no telling whether they curse us
or bless us. This is Sukkot, as they call it, and while it lasts, they
do none of the king's service, for, they maintain, all work is forbidden
them on these days.

"In this way they waste the whole year with tomfoolery and
fiddle-faddle, only in order to avoid doing the king's service. At the
expiration of every period of fifty years they have a jubilee year, and
every seventh year is a year of release, during which the land lies
fallow, for they neither sow nor reap therein, and sell us neither
fruits nor other products of the field, so that those of us who live
among them die of hunger. At the end of every period of twelve months,
they observe the New Year, at the end of every thirty days the New Moon,
and every seventh day is the Sabbath, the day on which, as they say, the
Lord of the world rested."

After Haman had finished his arraignment of the Jews, God said: "Thou
didst well enumerate the holidays of the Jews, yet thou didst omit the
two Purim and Shushan-Purim which the Jews will celebrate to commemorate
thy fall."

Clever though Haman's charge was, the vindication of the Jews was no
whit less clever. For they found a defender in the archangel Michael.
While Haman was delivering his indictment, he spoke thus to God: "O Lord
of the world! Thou knowest well that the Jews are not accused of
idolatry, nor of immoral conduct, nor of shedding blood; they are
accused only of observing Thy Torah." God pacified him: "As thou livest,
I have not abandoned them, I will not abandon them."

Haman's denunciations of the Jewish people found a ready echo in the
heart of the king. He replied: "I, too, desire the annihilation of the
Jews, but I fear their God, for He is mighty beyond compare, and He
loves His people with a great love. Whoever rises up against them, He
crushes under their feet. Just think of Pharaoh! Should his example not
be a warning to us? He ruled the whole world, yet, because he oppressed
the Jews, he was visited with frightful plagues. God delivered them from
the Egyptians, and cleft the sea for them, a miracle never done for any
other nation, and when Pharaoh pursued them with an army of six hundred
thousand warriors, he and his host together were drowned in the sea. Thy
ancestor Amalek, O Haman, attacked them with four hundred thousand
heroes, and all of them God delivered into the hands of Joshua, who slew
them. Sisera had forty thousand generals under him, each one commander
of a hundred thousand men, yet they all were annihilated. The God of the
Jews ordered the stars to consume the warriors of Sisera, and then He
caused the great general to fall into the power of a woman, to become a
by-word and a reproach forever. Many and valorous rulers have risen up
against them, they all were cast down by their God and crushed unto
their everlasting disgrace. Now, then, can we venture aught against
them?"

Haman, however, persisted. Day after day he urged the king to consent to
his plan. Ahasuerus thereupon called together a council of the wise men
of all nations and tongues. To them he submitted the question, whether
the Jews ought not to be destroyed, seeing they differed from all other
peoples. The sage councillors inquired: "Who is it that desires to
induce thee to take so fatal a step? If the Jewish nation is destroyed,
the world itself will cease to be, for the world exists only for the
sake of the Torah studied by Israel. Yea, the very sun and moon shed
their light only for the sake of Israel, and were it not for him, there
were neither day nor night, and neither dew nor rain would moisten the
earth. More than this, all other nations beside Israel are designated as
'strangers' by God, but Israel He called in His love 'a people near to
Him,' and His 'children.' If men do not suffer their children and
kinsmen to be attacked with impunity, how much less will God sit by
quiet when Israel is assailed God the Ruler over all things, over the
powers in heaven above and on earth beneath, over the spirits and the
souls God with whom it lies to exalt and to degrade, to slay and to
revive."

Haman was ready with a reply to these words of the wise: "The God who
drowned Pharaoh in the sea, and who did all the wonders and signs ye
have recounted, that God is now in His dotage, He can neither see nor
protect. For did not Nebuchadnezzar destroy His house, burn His palace,
and scatter His people to all corners of the earth, and He was not able
to do one thing against it? If He had had power and strength, would he
not have displayed them? This is the best proof that He was waxed old
and feeble."

When the heathen sages heard these arguments advance by Haman, they
agreed to his plan, and put their signature to an edict decreeing the
persecution of the Jews.

### THE DECREE OF ANNIHILATION

This is the text of the decree which Haman issued to the heads of all
the nations regarding the annihilation of the Jews: "This herein is
written by me, the great officer of the king, his second in rank, the
first among the grandees, and one of the seven princes, and the most
distinguished among the nobles of the realm. I, in agreement with the
rulers of the provinces, the princes of the king, the chiefs and the
lords, the Eastern kings and the satraps, all being of the same
language, write you at the order of King Ahasuerus this writing sealed
with his signet, so that it may not be sent back, concerning the great
eagle Israel. The great eagle had stretched out his pinions over the
whole world; neither bird nor beast could withstand him. But there came
the great lion Nebuchadnezzar, and dealt the great eagle a stinging
blow. His pinions snapped, his feathers were plucked out, and his feet
were hacked off. The whole world has enjoyed rest, cheer, and
tranquillity since the moment the eagle was chased from his eyrie until
this day. Now we notice that he is using all efforts to secure wings. He
is permitting his feathers to grow, with the intention of covering us
and the whole world, as he did unto our forefathers. At the instance of
King Ahasuerus, all the magnates of the king of Media and Persia are
assembled, and we are writing you our joint advice, as follows: 'Set
snares for the eagle, and capture him before he renews his strength, and
soars back to his eyrie.' We advise you to tear out his plumage, break
his wings, give his flesh to the fowl of heaven, split the eggs lying in
his nest, and crush his young, so that his memorial may vanish from the
world. Our counsel is not like unto Pharaoh's; he sought to destroy only
the men of Israel; to the women he did no harm. It is not like unto the
plan of Esau, who wanted to slay his brother Jacob and keep his children
as slaves. It is not like unto the tactics of Amalek, who pursued Israel
and smote the hindmost and feeble, but left the strong unscathed. It is
not like unto the policy of Nebuchadnezzar, who carried them away into
exile, and settled them near his own throne. And it is not like unto the
way of Sennacherib, who assigned a land unto the Jews as fair as their
own had been. We, recognizing clearly what the situation is, have
resolved to slay the Jews, annihilate them, young and old, so that their
name and their memorial may be no more, and their posterity may be cut
off forever."

The edict issued by Ahasuerus against the Jews ran thus: "To all the
peoples, nations, and races: Peace be with you! This is to acquaint you
that one came to us who is not of our nation and of our land, an
Amalekite, the son of great ancestors, and his name is Haman. He made a
trifling request of me, saying: 'Among us there dwells a people, the
most despicable of all, who are a stumbling-block in every time. They
are exceeding presumptuous, and they know our weakness and our
shortcomings. They curse the king in these words, which are constantly
in their mouths: "God is the King of the world forever and ever: He will
make the heathen to perish out of His land: He will execute vengeance
and punishments upon the peoples." From the beginning of all time they
have been ungrateful, as witness their behavior toward Pharaoh. With
kindness he received them, their wives, and their children, at the time
of a famine. He gave up to them the best of his land. He provided them
with food and all they needed. Then Pharaoh desired to build a palace,
and he requested the Jews to do it for him. They began the work
grudgingly, amid murmurings, and it is not completed unto this day. In
the midst of it, they approached Pharaoh with these words: "We wish to
offer sacrifices to our God in a place that is a three days' journey
from here, and we petition thee to lend us silver and gold vessels, and
clothes, and apparel." So much did they borrow, that each one bore
ninety ass-loads off with him, and Egypt was emptied out. When, the
three days having elapsed, they did not return, Pharaoh pursued them in
order to recover the stolen treasures. What did the Jews? They had among
them a man by the name of Moses, the son of Amram, an arch-wizard, who
had been bred in the house of Pharaoh. When they reached the sea, this
man raised his staff, and cleft the waters, and led the Jews through
them dryshod, while Pharaoh and his host were drowned.

"'Their God helps them as long as they observe His law, so that none can
prevail against them. Balaam, the only prophet we heathens ever had,
they slew with the sword, as they did unto Sihon and Og, the powerful
kings of Canaan, whose land they took after killing them. Likewise they
brought ruin upon Amalek, the great and glorious ruler they, and Saul
their king, and Samuel their prophet. Later they had an unmerciful king,
David by name, who smote the Philistines, the Ammonites, and the
Moabites, and not one of them could discomfit him. Solomon, the son of
this king, being wise and sagacious, built them a house of worship in
Jerusalem, that they might not scatter to all parts of the world. But
after they had been guilty of many crimes against their God, He
delivered them into the hand of King Nebuchadnezzar, who deported them
to Babylonia.

"'To this day they are among us, and though they are under our hand, we
are of none account in their eyes. Their religion and their laws are
different from the religion and he laws of all the other nations. Their
sons do not marry with our daughters, our gods they do not worship, they
have no regard for our honor, and they refuse to bend the knee before
us. Calling themselves freemen, they will not do our service, and our
commands they heed not.'

"Therefore the grandees, the princes, and the satraps have been
assembled before us, we have taken counsel together, and we have
resolved an irrevocable resolution, according to the laws of the Medes
and Persians, to extirpate the Jews from among the inhabitants of the
earth. We have sent the edict to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces
of my empire, to slay them, their sons, their wives, and their little
children, on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar none is to escape.
As they did to our forefathers, and desired to do unto us, so shall be
done unto them, and their possessions are to be given over to the
spoilers. Thus shall ye do, that ye may find grace before me. This is
the writing of the letter which I send to you, Ahasuerus king of Media
and Persia."

The price Haman offered the king for the Jews was ten thousand
hundredweights of silver. He took the number of the Jews at their exodus
from Egypt, six hundred thousand, as the basis of his calculation, and
offered a half-shekel for every soul of them, the sum each Israelite had
to pay yearly for the maintenance of the sanctuary. Though the sum was
so vast that Haman could not find coin enough to pay it, but promised to
deliver it in the form of silver bars, Ahasuerus refused the ransom.
When Haman made the offer, he said: "Let us cast lots. If thou drawest
Israel and I draw money, then the sale stands as a valid transaction. If
the reverse, it is not valid." Because of the sins of the Jews, the sale
was confirmed by the lots. But Haman was not too greatly pleased with
his own success. He disliked to give up so large a sum of money.
Observing his ill humor, Ahasuerus said: "Keep the money; I do not care
either to make or to lose money on account of the Jews."

For the Jews it was fortunate that the king did not accept money for
them, else his subjects would not have obeyed his second edict, the one
favorable to the Jews. They would have been able to advance the
argument, that the king, by accepting a sum of money for them, had
resigned his rights over the Jews in favor of Haman, who, therefore,
could deal with them as he pleased.

The agreement between Ahasuerus and Haman was concluded at a carouse, by
way of punishment for the crime of the sons of Jacob, who had
unmercifully sold their brother Joseph into slavery to the Ishmaelites
while eating and drinking.

The joy of this Jew-hating couple for Ahasuerus hated the Jews with no
less fierce a hatred than Haman did was shared by none. The capital city
of Shushan was in mourning and sorely perplexed. Scarcely had the edict
of annihilation been promulgated against the Jews, when all sorts of
misfortunes began to happen in the city. Women who were hanging up their
wash to dry on the roofs of the houses dropped dead; men who went to
draw water fell into the wells, and lost their lives. While Ahasuerus
and Haman were making merry in the palace, the city was thrown into
consternation and mourning.

### SATAN INDICTS THE JEWS

The position of the Jews after the royal edict became known beggars
description. If a Jew ventured abroad on the street to make a purchase,
he was almost throttled by the Persians, who taunted him with these
words: "Never mind, to-morrow will soon be here, and then I shall kill
thee, and take thy money away from thee." If a Jew offered to sell
himself as a slave, he was rejected; not even the sacrifice of his
liberty could protect him against the loss of his life.

Mordecai, however, did not despair; he trusted in the Divine help. On
his way from the court, after Haman and his ilk had informed him with
malicious joy of the king's pleasure concerning the Jews, he met Jewish
children coming from school. He asked the first child what verse from
the Scriptures he had studied in school that day, and the reply was: "Be
not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked when
it cometh." The verse committed to memory by the second was: "Let them
take counsel together, but it shall be brought to naught; let them speak
the word, but it shall not stand; for God is with us." And the verse
which the third had learnt was: "And even to old age I am He, and even
to hoar hairs I will carry you: I have made and will bear; yea, I will
carry and will deliver."

When Mordecai heard these verses, he broke out into jubilation,
astonishing Haman not a little. Mordecai told him, "I rejoice at the
good tidings announced to me by the school children." Haman thereupon
fell into such a rage that he exclaimed: "In sooth, they shall be the
first to feel the weight of my hand."

What gave Mordecai the greatest concern, was the certainty that the
danger had been invited by the Jews themselves, through their sinful
conduct in connection with the banquets given by Ahasuerus. Eighteen
thousand five hundred Jews had taken part in them; they had eaten and
drunk, intoxicated themselves and committed immoralities, as Haman had
foreseen, the very reason, indeed, he had advised the king to hold the
banquets.

Thereupon Satan had indicted the Jews. The accusations which he produced
against them were of such a nature that God at once ordered writing
materials to be brought to Him for the decree of annihilation, and it
was written and sealed.

When the Torah heard that Satan's designs against the Jews had
succeeded, she broke out into bitter weeping before God, and her
lamentations awakened the angels, who likewise began to wail, saying:
"If Israel is to be destroyed, of what avail is the whole world?"

The sun and the moon heard the lamentations of the angels, and they
donned their mourning garb and also wept bitterly and wailed, saying:
"Is Israel to be destroyed, Israel who wanders from town to town, and
from land to land, only for the sake of the study of the Torah; who
suffers grievously under the hand of the heathen, only because he
observes the Torah and the sign of the covenant?"

In great haste the prophet Elijah ran to the Patriarchs and to the other
prophets, and to the saints in Israel, and addressed these words to
them: "O ye fathers of the world! Angels, and the sun and the moon, and
heaven and earth, and all the celestial hosts are weeping bitterly. The
whole world is seized with throes as of a woman in travail, by reason of
your children, who have forfeited their life on account of their sins,
and ye sit quiet and tranquil." Thereupon Moses said to Elijah: "Knowest
thou any saints in the present generation of Israel?" Elijah named
Mordecai, and Moses sent the prophet to him, with the charge that he,
the "saint of the living generation," should unite his prayers with the
prayers of the saints among the dead, and perhaps the doom might be
averted from Israel. But Elijah hesitated. "O faithful shepherd," he
said, "the edict of annihilation issued by God is written and sealed."
Moses, however, did not desist; he urged the Patriarchs: "If the edict
is sealed with wax, your prayers will be heard; if with blood, then all
is vain."

Elijah hastened to Mordecai, who, when first he heard what God had
resolved upon, tore his garments and was possessed by a great fear,
though before he had confidently hoped that help would come form God. He
gathered together all the school children, and had them fast, so that
their hunger should drive them to moan and groan. Then it was that
Israel spoke to God: "O Lord of the world! When the heathen rage against
me, they do not desire my silver and gold, they desire only that I
should be exterminated from off the face of the earth. Such was the
design of Nebuchadnezzar when he wanted to compel Israel to worship the
idol. Had it not been for Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, I had
disappeared from the world. Now it is Haman who desires to uproot the
whole vine."

Then Mordecai addressed all the people thus: "O people of Israel, that
art so dear and precious in the sight of thy Heavenly Father! Knowest
thou not what has happened? Hast thou not heard that the king and Haman
have resolved to remove us off the face of the earth, to destroy us from
beneath the sun? We have no king on whom we can depend, and no prophet
to intercede for us with prayers. There is no place whither we can flee,
no land wherein we can find safety. We are like sheep without a
shepherd, like a ship upon the sea without a pilot. We are like an
orphan born after the death of his father, and death robs him of his
mother, too, when he has scarce begun to draw nourishment from her
breast."

After this address a great prayer-meeting was called outside of Shushan.
The Ark containing the scroll of the law, covered with sackcloth and
strewn with ashes, was brought thither. The scroll was unrolled, and the
following verses read from it: "When thou art in tribulation, and all
these things are come upon thee, in the latter days thou shalt return to
the Lord thy God, and hearken unto His voice, for the Lord thy God is a
merciful God: He will not fail thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget
the covenant of they fathers which He swore unto them."

Thereunto Mordecai added words of admonition: "O people of Israel, thou
art dear and precious to thy Father in heaven, let us follow the example
of the inhabitants of Nineveh, doing as they did when the prophet Jonah
came to them to announce the destruction of the city. The king arose
from his throne, laid his crown from him, covered himself with
sackcloth, and sat in ashes, and he made proclamation, and published
through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, 'Let
neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not
feed, nor drink water, but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man
and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every
one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.'
Then God repented Him of the evil He had designed to bring upon them,
and He did it not. Now, then, let us follow their example, let us hold a
fast, mayhap God will have mercy upon us."

Furthermore spake Mordecai: "O Lord of the world! Didst Thou not swear
unto our fathers to make us as many as the stars in the heavens? And now
we are as sheep in the shambles. What has become of Thine oath?" He
cried aloud, though he knew God hears the softest whisper, for he said:
"O Father of Israel, what hast Thou done unto me? One single cry of
anguish uttered by Esau Thou didst repay with the blessing of his father
Isaac, 'By thy sword shall thou live,' and now we ourselves are
abandoned to the mercy of the sword." What Mordecai was not aware of,
was that he, the descendant of Jacob, was brought unto weeping and
wailing by Haman, the descendant of Esau, as a punishment, because Jacob
himself had brought Esau unto weeping and wailing.

### THE DREAM OF MORDECAI FULFILLED

Esther, who knew naught of what was happening at court, was greatly
alarmed when her attendants told her that Mordecai had appeared in the
precincts of the palace clothed in sackcloth and ashes. She was so
overcome by fright that she was deprived of the joys of motherhood to
which she had been looking forward with happy expectancy. She sent
clothes to Mordecai, who, however, refused to lay aside his garb of
mourning until God permitted miracles to come to pass for Israel,
wherein he followed the example of such great men in Israel as Jacob,
David, and Ahab, and of the Gentile inhabitants of Nineveh at the time
of Jonah. By no means would he array himself in court attire so long as
his people was exposed to sure suffering. The queen sent for Daniel,
called also Hathach in the Scriptures, and charged him to learn from
Mordecai wherefore he was mourning.

To escape all danger from spying ears, Hathach and Mordecai had their
conversation in the open, like Jacob when he consulted with his wives
Leah and Rachel about leaving their father Laban. By Hathach Mordecai
sent word to the queen, that Haman was an Amalekite, who like his
ancestor sought to destroy Israel. He requested her to appear before the
king and plead for the Jews, reminding her at the same time of a dream
he had once had and told her about.

Once, when Mordecai had spent a long time weeping and lamenting over the
misery of the Jews in the Dispersion, and prayed fervently to God to
redeem Israel and rebuild the Temple, he fell asleep, and in his sleep a
dream visited him. He dreamed he was transported to a desert place he
had never seen before. Many nations lived there jumbled together, only
one small and despised nation kept apart at a short distance. Suddenly a
snake shot up from the midst of the nations, rising higher and higher,
and growing stronger and larger in proportion as it rose. It darted in
the direction of the spot in which they tiny nation stood, and tried to
project itself upon it. Impenetrable clouds and darkness enveloped the
little nation, and when the snake was on the point of seizing it, a
hurricane arose from the four corners of the world, covering the snake
as clothes cover a man, and blew it to bits. The fragments scattered
hither and thither like chaff before the wind, until not a speck of the
monster was to be found anywhere. Then the cloud and the darkness
vanished from above the little nation, the splendor of the sun again
enveloped it.

This dream Mordecai recorded in a book, and when the storm began to rage
against the Jews, he thought of it, and demanded that Esther go to the
king as the advocate of her people. At first she did not feel inclined
to accede to the wishes of Mordecai. By her messenger she recalled to
his mind, that he himself had insisted upon her keeping her Jewish
descent a secret. Besides, she had always tried to refrain from
appearing before the king at her own initiative, in order that she might
not be instrumental in bringing down sin upon her soul, for she well
remembered Mordecai's teaching, that "a Jewish woman, captive among the
heathen, who of her own accord goes to them, loses her portion in the
Jewish nation." She had been rejoicing that her petitions had been
granted, and the king had not come nigh unto her this last month. Was
she now voluntarily to present herself before him? Furthermore, she had
her messenger inform Mordecai, that Haman had introduced a new palace
regulation. Any one who appeared before the king without having been
summoned by Haman, would suffer the death penalty. Therefore, she could
not, if she would, go to the king to advocate the cause of the Jews.

Esther urged her uncle to refrain from incensing Haman and furnishing
him with a pretext for wreaking the hatred of Esau to Jacob upon
Mordecai and his nation. Mordecai, however, was firmly convinced that
Esther was destined by God to save Israel. How could her miraculous
history be explained otherwise? At the very moment Esther was taken to
court, he had thought: "Is it conceivable that God would force so pious
a woman to wed with a heathen, were it not that she is appointed to save
Israel from menacing dangers?"

Firm as Mordecai was in his determination to make Esther take a hand in
affairs, he yet did not find it a simple matter to communicate with her.
For Hathach was killed by Haman as soon as it was discovered that he was
acting as mediator between Mordecai and Esther. There was none to
replace him, unto God dispatched the archangels Michael and Gabriel to
carry messages from one to the other and back again.

Mordecai sent word to her, if she let the opportunity to help Israel
slip by, she would have to give account for the omission before the
heavenly court. To Israel in distress, however, help would come from
other quarters. Never had God forsaken His people in time of need.
Moreover, he admonished her, that, as the descendant of Saul, it was her
duty to make reparation for her ancestor's sin in not having put Agag to
death. Had he done as he was bidden, the Jews would not now have to fear
the machinations of Haman, the offspring of Agag. He bade her supplicate
her Heavenly Father to deal with the present enemies of Israel as He had
dealt with his enemies in former ages. To give her encouragement,
Mordecai continued: "Is Haman so surpassing great that his plan against
the Jews must succeed? Dost though mean to say that he is superior to
his own ancestor Amalek, whom God crushed when he precipitated himself
upon Israel? Is he mightier than the thirty-one kings who fought against
Israel and whom Joshua slew 'with the word of God'? Is he stronger than
Sisera, who went out against Israel with nine hundred iron chariots, and
yet met his death at the hands of a mere woman, the punishment for
having withdrawn the use of the water-springs from the Israelites and
prevented their wives from taking the prescribed ritual baths and thus
from fulfilling their conjugal duty? Is he more powerful than Goliath,
who reviled the warriors of Israel, and was slain by David? Or is he
more invincible than the sons of Orpah, who waged wars with Israel, and
were killed by David and his men? Therefore, do not refrain thy mouth
from prayer, and thy lips from supplication, for on account of the
merits of our fathers, Israel has ever and ever been snatched out of the
jaws of death. He who has at all times done wonders for Israel, will
deliver the enemy into our hands now, for us to do with him as seemeth
best to us."

What he endeavored to impress upon Esther particularly, was that God
would bring help to Israel without her intermediation, but it was to her
interest to use the opportunity, for which alone she had reached her
exalted place, to make up for the transgressions committed by her house,
Saul and his descendants.

Yielding at last to the arguments of Mordecai, Esther was prepared to
risk life in this world, in order to secure life in the world to come.
She made only one request of her uncle. He was to have the Jews spend
three days in prayer and fasting in her behalf, that she might find
favor in the eyes of the king. At first Mordecai was opposed to the
proclamation of a fast, because it was Passover time, and the law
prohibits fasting on the holidays. But he finally assented to Esther's
reasoning: "Of what avail are the holidays, if there is no Israel to
celebrate them, and without Israel, there would not be even a Torah.
Therefore it is advisable to transgress on law, that God may have mercy
upon us."

### THE PRAYER OF ESTHER

Accordingly Mordecai made arrangements for a fast and a prayer-meeting.
On the very day of the festival, he had himself ferried across the water
to the other side of Shushan, where all the Jews of the city could
observe the fast together. It was important that the Jewish residents of
Shushan beyond all other Jews should do penance and seek pardon from
God, because they had committed the sin of partaking of Ahasuerus's
banquet. Twelve thousand priests marched in the procession, trumpets in
their right hands, and the holy scrolls of the law in their left,
weeping and mourning, and exclaiming against God: "Here is the Torah
Thou gavest us. Thy beloved people is about to be destroyed. When that
comes to pass, who will be left to read the Torah and make mention of
Thy name? The sun and the moon will refuse to shed their light abroad,
for they were created only for the sake of Israel." Then they fell upon
their faces, and said: "Answer us, our Father, answer us, our King." The
whole people joined in their cry, and the celestials wept with them, and
the Fathers came forth from their graves.

After a three days' fast, Esther arose from the earth and dust, and made
preparations to betake herself to the king. She arrayed herself in a
silken garment, embroidered with gold from Ophir and spangled with
diamonds and pearls sent her from Africa; a golden crown was on her
head, and on her feet shoes of gold.

After she had completed her attire, she pronounced the following prayer:
"Thou art the great God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the
God of my father Benjamin. Not because I consider myself without
blemish, do I dare appear before the foolish king, but that the people
of Israel may not be cut off from the world. Is it not for the sake of
Israel alone that the whole world was created, and if Israel should
cease to exist, who will come and exclaim 'Holy, holy, holy' thrice
daily before Thee? As Thou didst save Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah out
of the burning furnace, and Daniel out of the den of lions, so save me
out of the hand of this foolish king, and make me to appear charming and
graceful in his eyes. I entreat Thee to give ear to my prayer in this
time of exile and banishment from our land. By reason of our sins the
threatening words of the Holy Scriptures are accomplished upon us: 'Ye
shall sell yourselves unto your enemies for bondmen and for bondwomen,
and no man shall buy you.' The decree to kill us has been issued. We are
delivered up unto the sword for destruction, root and branch. The
children of Abraham covered themselves with sackcloth and ashes, but
though the elders sinned, what wrongs have the children committed, and
though the children committed wrongs, what have the sucklings done? The
nobles of Jerusalem came forth from their graves, for their children
were given up to the sword.

"How quickly have the days of our joy flown by! The wicked Haman has
surrendered us to our enemies for slaughter.

"I will recount before Thee the deeds of Thy friends, and with Abraham
will I begin. Thou didst try him with all temptations, yet didst Thou
find him faithful. O that Thou wouldst support his beloved children for
his sake, and aid them, so that Thou wouldst bear them as an unbreakable
seal upon Thy right hand. Call Haman to account for the wrong he would
do us, and be revenged upon the son of Hammedatha. Demand requital of
Haman and not of Thy people, for he sought to annihilate us all at one
stroke, he, the enemy and afflicter of Thy people, whom he endeavors to
hem in on all sides.

"With an eternal bond Thou didst bind us unto Thee. O that Thou wouldst
uphold us for the sake of Isaac, who was bound. Haman offered the king
ten thousand talents of silver for us. Raise Thou our voice, and answer
us, and bring us forth out of the narrow place into enlargement. Thou
who breakest the mightiest, crush Haman, so that he may never again rise
from his fall. I am ready to appear before the king, to entreat grace
for my inheritance. Send Thou an angel of compassion with me on mine
errand, and let grace and favor be my companions. May the righteousness
of Abraham go before me, the binding of Isaac raise me, the charm of
Jacob be put into my mouth, and the grace of Joseph upon my tongue.
Happy the man who putteth his trust in God; he is not confounded. He
will lend me His right hand and His left hand, with which He created the
whole world. Ye, all ye of Israel, pray for me as I pray in your behalf.
For whatsoever a man may ask of God in the time of his distress, is
granted unto him. Let us look upon the deeds of our fathers and do like
unto them, and He will answer our supplications. The left hand of
Abraham held Isaac by the throat, and his right hand grasped the knife.
He willingly did Thy bidding, nor did he delay to execute Thy command.
Heaven opened its windows to give space to the angels, who cried
bitterly, and said: 'Woe to the world, if this thing should come to
pass!' I also call upon Thee! O answer me, for Thou givest ear unto all
who are afflicted and oppressed. Thou art called the Merciful and the
Gracious; Thou art slow to anger and great in lovingkindness and truth.
Hear our voice and answer us, and lead us out of distress into
enlargement. For three days have I fasted in accordance with the number
of days Abraham journey to bind his son upon the altar before Thee. Thou
didst make a covenant with him, and didst promise him: 'Whenever thy
children shall be in distress, I will remember the binding of Isaac
favorably unto them, and deliver them out of their troubles.' Again, I
fasted three days corresponding to the three classes Israel, priests,
Levites, and Israelites, who stood at the foot of Sinai, and said: 'All
the Lord hath spoken will we do, and be obedient.'"

Esther concluded her prayer and said: "O God, Lord of hosts! Thou that
searchest the heart and the reins, in this hour do Thou remember the
merits of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that my petition to Thee may not be
turned aside, nor my request be left unfulfilled.'

### ESTHER INTERCEDES

After finishing her prayer, Esther betook herself to the king,
accompanied by three attendants, one walking to the right of her, the
second on the other side, and the third bearing her train, heavy with
the precious stones with which it was studded. Her chief adornment was
the holy spirit that was poured out over her. But scarcely did she enter
the chamber containing the idols, when the holy spirit departed from
her, and she cried out in great distress: "Eli, Eli, lamah azabtani!
Shall I be chastised for acts that I do against my will, and only in
obedience to the promptings of sore need? Why should my fate be
different from that of the Mother? When Pharaoh only attempted to
approach Sarah, plagues came upon him and his house, but I have been
compelled for years to live with this heathen, and Thou dost not deliver
me out of his hand. O Lord of the world! Have I not paid scrupulous heed
to the three commands Thou didst specially ordain for women?"

To reach the king, Esther had to pass through seven apartments, each
measuring ten ells in length. The first three she traversed unhindered;
they were too far off for the king to observe her progress through them.
But barely had she crossed the threshold of the fourth chamber, when
Ahasuerus caught sight of her, and, overcome by rage, he exclaimed: "O
for the departed, their like is not found again on earth! How I urged
and entreated Vashti to appear before me, but she refused, and I had her
killed therefor. This Esther come hither without invitation, like unto a
public prostitute."

In consternation and despair Esther stood rooted to the centre of the
fourth chamber. Having once allowed her to pass through the doors under
their charge, the guards of the first four rooms had forfeited their
authority over her; and to the guards in the other three rooms, she had
not yet given cause for interfering with her. Yet the courtiers were so
confident that Esther was about to suffer the death penalty, that the
sons of Haman were already busy dividing her jewels among themselves,
and casting lots for her royal purple. Esther herself was keenly aware
of her dangerous position. In her need, she besought God: "Eli, Eli,
lamah azabtani," and prayed to Him the words which have found their
place in the Psalter composed by King David. Because she put her
confidence in God, He answered her petition, and sent her three angels
to help her: the one enveloped her countenance with "the threads of
grace," the second raised her head, and the third drew out the sceptre
of Ahasuerus until it touched her. The king turned his head round, to
avoid seeing Esther, but the angels forced him to look her way, and be
conquered by her seductive charm.

By reason of her long fast, Esther was so weak that she was unable to
extend her hand toward the sceptre of the king. The archangel Michael
had to draw her near it. Ahasuerus then said: "I see, thou must have a
most important request to prefer, else thou hadst not risked thy life
deliberately. I am ready to give it thee, even to the half of the
kingdom. There is but one petition I cannot grant, and that is the
restoration of the Temple. I gave my oath to Geshem the Arabian,
Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the Ammonite, not to allow it to be
rebuilt, from fear of the Jews, lest they rise up against me."

For the moment, Esther refrained from uttering her petition. All she
asked was, that the king and Haman would come to a banquet she proposed
to give. She had good reasons for this peculiar course of conduct. She
desired to disarm Haman's suspicions regarding her Jewish descent, and
to lead her fellow-Jews to fix their hope upon God and not upon her. At
the same time, it was her plan to arouse jealousy of Haman in both the
king and the princes. She was quite ready to sacrifice her own life, if
her stratagems would but involve the life of Haman, too. At the banquet
she therefore favored Haman in such manner that Ahasuerus could not but
be jealous. She moved her chair close to Haman's, and when Ahasuerus
handed her his wine-cup, to let her drink of it first, she passed it on
to his minister.

After the banquet, the king repeated his question, and again made the
asseveration, that he would fulfill all her wishes at whatever cost,
barring only the restoration of the Temple. Esther, however, was not yet
ready; she preferred to wait another day before taking up the conflict
with Haman. She had before her eyes the example of Moses, who also
craved a day's preparation before going out against Amalek, the ancestor
of Haman.

Deceived by the attention and distinction accorded him by Esther, Haman
felt secure in his position, priding himself not only on the love of the
king, but also on the respect of the queen. He felt himself to be the
most privileged being in all the wide realm governed by Ahasuerus.

Filled with arrogant self-sufficiency, he passed by Mordecai, who not
only refused to give him the honors decreed in his behalf, but, besides,
pointed to his knee, inscribed with the bill of sale whereby Haman had
become the slave of Mordecai. Doubly and triply enraged, he resolved to
make an example of the Jew. But he was not satisfied with inflicting
death by a simple kick.

On reaching his home he was disappointed not to find his wife Zeresh,
the daughter of the Persian satrap Tattenai. As always when Haman was at
court, she had gone to her paramours. He sent for her and his three
hundred and sixty-five advisers, and with them he took counsel as to
what was to be done to Mordecai. Pointing to a representation of his
treasure chamber, which he wore on his bosom, he said: "And all this is
worthless in my sight when I look upon Mordecai, the Jew. What I eat and
drink loses its savor, if I but think of him."

Among his advisers and sons, of whom there were two hundred and eight,
none was so clever as Zeresh his wife. She spoke thus: "If the man thou
tellest of is a Jew, thou wilt not be able to do aught to him except by
sagacity. If thou castest him into the fire, it will have no effect upon
him, for Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah escaped from the burning furnace
unhurt; Joseph went free from prison; Manasseh prayed to God, and He
heard him, and saved him from the iron furnace; to drive him out in the
wilderness is useless, thou knowest the desert did no evil to the
Israelites that passed through it; putting out his eyes avails naught,
for Samson blind did more mischief than ever Samson seeing. Therefore
hang him, for no Jew has ever escaped death by hanging."

Haman was well pleased with the words of his wife. She fetched
artificers in wood and iron, the former to erect the cross, the latter
to make the nails. Their children danced around in high glee while
Zeresh played upon the cithern, and Haman in his pleasurable excitement
said: "To the wood workers I shall give abundant pay, and the iron
workers I shall invite to a banquet."

When the cross was finished, Haman himself tested it, to see that all
was in working order. A heavenly voice was heard: "It is good for Haman
the villain, and for the son of Hammedatha it is fitting."

### THE DISTURBED NIGHT

The night during which Haman erected the cross for Mordecai was the
first night of Passover, the very night in which miracles without number
had ever been done for the Fathers and for Israel. But this time the
night of joy was changed into a night of mourning and a night of fears.
Wherever there were Jews, they passed the night in weeping and
lamenting. The greatest terrors it held for Mordecai, because his own
people accused him of having provoked their misfortunes by his haughty
behavior toward Haman.

Excitement and consternation reigned in heaven as well as on earth. When
Haman had satisfied himself that the cross intended for his enemy was
properly constructed, he repaired to the Bet ha-Midrash, where he found
Mordecai and all the Jewish school children, twenty-two thousand in
number, in tears and sorrow. He ordered them to be put in chains,
saying: "First I shall kill off these, and then I shall hang Mordecai."
The mothers hastened thither with bread and water, and coaxed their
children to take something before they had to encounter death. The
children, however, laid their hands upon their books, and said: "As our
teacher Mordecai liveth, we will neither eat nor drink, but we will
perish exhausted with fasting." They rolled up their sacred scrolls, and
handed them to their teachers with the words: "For our devotion to the
study of the Torah, we had hoped to be rewarded with long life,
according to the promised held out in the Holy Scriptures. As we are not
worthy thereof, remove the books!" The out-cries of the children and of
the teachers in the Bet ha-Midrash, and the weeping of the mothers
without, united with the supplications of the Fathers, reached unto
heaven in the third hour of the night, and God said: "I hear the voice
of tender lambs and sheep!" Moses arose and addressed God thus: "Thou
knowest well that the voices are not of lambs and sheep, but of the
young of Israel, who for three days have been fasting and languishing in
fetters, only to be slaughtered on the morrow to the delight of the
arch-enemy."

Then God felt compassion with Israel, for the sake of his innocent
little ones. He broke the seal with which the heavenly decree of
annihilation had been fastened, and the decree itself he tore in pieces.
From this moment on Ahasuerus became restless, and sleep was made to
flee his eyes, for the purpose that the redemption of Israel might be
brought to pass. God sent down Michael, the leader of the hosts of
Israel, who was to keep sleep from the king, and the archangel Gabriel
descended, and threw the king out of his bed on the floor, no less than
three hundred and sixty-five times, continually whispering in his ear:
"O thou ingrate, reward him who deserves to be rewarded."

To account for his sleeplessness, Ahasuerus thought he might have been
poisoned, and he was about to order the execution of those charged with
the preparation of his food. But they succeeded in convincing him of
their innocence, by calling to his attention that Esther and Haman had
shared his evening meal with him, yet they felt no unpleasant effects.
Then suspicions against his wife and his friend began to arise in his
mind. He accused them inwardly of having conspired together to put him
out of the way. He sought to banish this thought with the reflection,
that if a conspiracy had existed against him, his friends would have
warned him of it. But the reflection brought others in its train: Did he
have any friends? Was it not possible that by leaving valuable services
unrewarded, he had forfeited the friendly feelings toward him? He
therefore commanded that the chronicles of the kings of Persia be read
to him. He would compare his own acts with what his predecessors had
done, and try to find out whether he might count upon friends.

What was read to him, did not restore his tranquility of mind, for he
saw a poor man before him none other than the angel Michael who called
to him continually: "Haman wants to kill thee, and become king in thy
stead. Let this serve thee as proof that I am telling thee the truth:
Early in the morning he will appear before thee and request permission
of thee to kill him who saved thy life. And when thou inquirest of him
what honor should be done to him whom the king delighteth to honor, he
will ask to be given the apparel, the crown, and the horse of the king
as signs of distinction."

Ahasuerus's excitement was soothed only when the passage in the
chronicles was reached describing the loyalty of Mordecai. Had the
wishes of the reader been consulted, Ahasuerus had never heard this
entry, for it was a son of Haman who was filling the office of reader,
and he was desirous of passing the incident over in silence. But a
miracle occurred the words were heard though they were not uttered!

The names of Mordecai and Israel had a quieting influence upon the king,
and he dropped asleep. He dreamed that Haman, sword in hand, was
approaching him with evil intent, and when, early in the morning, Haman
suddenly, without being announced, entered the antechamber and awakened
the king, Ahasuerus was persuaded of the truth of his dream. The king
was still further set against Haman by the reply he gave to the
question, how honor was to be shown to the man whom the king delighteth
to honor. Believing himself to be the object of the king's good-will, he
advised Ahasuerus to have his favorite arrayed in the king's coronation
garments, and the crown royal put upon his head. Before him one of the
grandees of the kingdom was to run, doing herald's service, proclaiming
that whosoever did not prostrate himself and bow down before him whom
the king delighteth to honor, would have his head cut off, and his house
given over to pillage.

Haman was quick to notice that he had made a mistake, for he saw the
king's countenance change color at the mention of the word crown. He
therefore took good care not to refer to it again. In spite of this
precaution, Ahasuerus saw in the words of Haman a striking verification
of his vision, and he was confident that Haman cherished designs against
his life and his throne.

### THE FALL OF HAMAN

Haman was soon to find out that he had gone far afield in supposing
himself to be the man whom the king delighted to honor. The king's
command ran: "Hasten to the royal treasure chambers; fetch thence a
cover of find purple, a raiment of delicate silk, furnished forth with
golden bells and pomegranates and bestrewn with diamonds and pearls, and
the large golden crown which was brought me from Macedonia upon the day
I ascended the throne. Furthermore, fetch thence the sword and the coat
of mail sent me from Ethiopia, and the two veils embroidered with pearls
which were Africa's gift. Then repair to the royal stables, and lead
forth the black horse whereon I sat at my coronation. With all these
insignia of honor, seek out Mordecai!"

Haman: "Which Mordecai?"

Ahasuerus: "Mordecai the Jew."

Haman: "There be many Jews named Mordecai."

Ahasuerus: "The Jew Mordecai who sits at the king's gate."

Haman: "There be many royal gates; I know not which thou meanest."

Ahasuerus: "The gate that leads from the harem to the palace."

Haman: "This man is my enemy and the enemy of my house. Rather would I
give him ten thousand talents of silver than do him this honor."

Ahasuerus: "Ten thousand talents of silver shall be given him, and he
shall be made lord over thy house, but these honors must thou show unto
him."

Haman: "I have ten sons. I would rather have them run before his horse
than do him this honor."

Ahasuerus: "Thou, thy sons, and thy wife shall be slaves to Mordecai,
but these honors must thou show unto him."

Haman: "O my lord and king, Mordecai is a common man. Appoint him to be
ruler over a city, or, if thou wilt, even over a district, rather than I
should do him this honor."

Ahasuerus: "I will appoint him ruler over cities and districts. All the
kings on land and on water shall pay him obedience, but these honors
must thou show unto him."

Haman: "Rather have coins struck bearing thy name together with his,
instead of mine as hitherto, than I should do him this honor."

Ahasuerus: "The man who saved the life of the king deserves to have his
name put on the coin of the realm. Nevertheless, these honors must thou
show unto him."

Haman: "Edicts and writings have been issued to all parts of the
kingdom, commanding that the nation to which Mordecai belongs shall be
destroyed. Recall them rather than I should do him this honor."

Ahasuerus: "The edicts and writings shall be recalled, yet these honors
must thou show unto Mordecai."

Seeing that all petitions and entreaties were ineffectual, and Ahasuerus
insisted upon the execution of his order, Haman went to the royal
treasure chambers, walking with his head bowed like a mourner's, his
ears hanging down, his eyes dim, his mouth screwed up, his heart
hardened, his bowels cut in pieces, his loins weakened, and his knees
knocking against each other. He gathered together the royal insignia,
and took them to Mordecai, accompanied on his way by Harbonah and Abzur,
who, at the order of the king, were to take heed whether Haman carried
out his wishes to the letter.

When Mordecai saw his enemy approach, he thought his last moment had
come. He urged his pupils to flee, that they might not "burn themselves
with his coals." But they refused, saying: "In life as in death we
desire to be with thee." The few moments left him, as he thought,
Mordecai spent in devotion. With words of prayer on his lips he desired
to pass away. Haman, therefore, had to address himself to the pupils of
Mordecai: "What was the last subject taught you by your teacher
Mordecai?" They told him they had been discussing the law of the \`Omer,
the sacrifice brought on that very day so long as the Temple had stood.
At his request, they described some of the details of the ceremony in
the Temple connected with the offering. He exclaimed: "Happy are you
that your ten farthings, with which you bought the wheat for the \`Omer,
produced a better effect than my ten thousand talents of silver, which I
offered unto the king for the destruction of the Jews."

Meantime Mordecai had finished his prayer. Haman stepped up to him, and
said: "Arise, thou pious son of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Thy sackcloth
and ashes availed more than my ten thousand talents of silver, which I
promised unto the king. They were not accepted, but thy prayers were
accepted by thy Father in heaven."

Mordecai, not yet disabused of the notion that Haman had come to take
him to the cross, requested the grace of a few minutes for his last
meal. Only Haman's repeated protests assured him. When Haman set about
arraying him with the royal apparel, Mordecai refused to put it on until
he had bathed, and had dressed his hair. Royal apparel agreed but ill
with his condition after three days of sackcloth and ashes. As luck
would have it, Esther had issued the command that the bathkeepers and
barbers were not to ply their trades on that day, and there was nothing
for Haman to do but perform the menial services Mordecai required. Haman
tried to play upon the feelings of Mordecai. Fetching a deep sigh, he
said: "The greatest in the king's realm is now acting as bathkeeper and
barber!" Mordecai, however, did not permit himself to be imposed upon.
He knew Haman's origin too well to be deceived; he remembered his
father, who had been bathkeeper and barber in a village.

Haman's humiliation was not yet complete. Mordecai, exhausted by his
three days' fast, was too weak to mount his horse unaided. Haman had to
serve him as footstool, and Mordecai took the opportunity to give him a
kick. Haman reminded him of the Scriptural verse: "Rejoice not when
thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he is
overthrown." Mordecai, however, refused to apply it to himself, for he
was chastising, not a personal enemy, but the enemy of his people, and
of such it is said in the Scriptures: "And thou shalt tread upon the
high places of thine enemies."

Finally, Haman caused Mordecai to ride through the streets of the city,
and proclaimed before him: "Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the
king delighteth to honor." In front of them marched twenty-seven
thousand youths detailed for this service from the court. In their right
hands they bore golden cups, and golden beakers in their left hands, and
they, too, proclaimed: "Thus shall be done unto the man whom the king
delighteth to honor." The procession furthermore was swelled by the
presence of Jews. They, however, made a proclamation of different tenor.
"Thus shall be done," they cried out, "unto the man whose honor is
desired by the King that hath created heaven and earth."

As he rode along, Mordecai gave praise to God: "I will extol Thee, O
Lord; for Thou hast raised me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice
over me. O Lord my God, I cried unto Thee, and Thou hast healed me. O
Lord, Thou hast brought up my soul from Sheol; Thou hast kept me alive,
that I should not go down to the pit." Whereupon his pupils joined in
with: "Sing praise unto the Lord, O ye saints of His, and give thanks to
His holy name. For His anger is but for a moment; in His favor is life;
weeping may tarry for the night, but joy cometh in the morning." Haman
added the verse thereto: "As for me, I said in my prosperity, I shall
never be moved. Thou, Lord, of Thy favor hadst made my mountain to stand
strong. Thou didst hide Thy face; I was troubled." Queen Esther
continued: "I cried to Thee, O Lord; and unto the Lord I made
supplication. What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the
pit? Shall the dust praise Thee? Shall it declare Thy truth?" and the
whole concourse of Jews present cried out: "Thou hast turned for me my
mourning into dancing; Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, and girded me with
gladness, to the end that my glory may sing praise to Thee, and not be
silent. O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto Thee forever."

When this procession passed the house of Haman, his daughter was looking
out of the window. She took the man on the horse to be her father, and
the leader of it, Mordecai. Raising a vessel filled with offal, she
emptied it out over the leader her own father. Scarce had the vessel
left her hand, when she realized the truth, and she threw herself from
the window, and lay crushed to death on the street below.

In spite of the sudden change in his fortunes, Mordecai ended the
eventful day as he had begun it, in prayer and fasting. No sooner was
the procession over than he put off the royal robes, and, again covering
himself with sackcloth, he prayed until night fell.

Haman was plunged in mourning, partly on account of the deep disgrace to
which he had been subjected, partly on account of the death of his
daughter. Neither his wife nor his friends could advise him how to mend
his sad fortunes. They could hold out only sorry consolation to him: "If
this Mordecai is of the seed of the saints, thou wilt not be able to
prevail against him. Thou wilt surely encounter the same fate as the
kings in their battle with Abraham, and Abimelech in his quarrel with
Isaac. As Jacob was victorious over the angel with whom he wrestled, and
Moses and Aaron caused the drowning of Pharaoh and his host, so Mordecai
will overcome thee in the end."

While they were yet talking, the king's chamberlains came, and hastily
carried Haman off to the banquet Esther had prepared, to prevent him and
his influential sons from plotting against the king. Ahasuerus repeated
his promise, to give Esther whatever she desired, always expecting the
restoration of the Temple. This time, casting her eyes heavenward,
Esther replied: "If I have found favor in thy sight, O Supreme King, and
if it please Thee, O King of the world, let my life be given me, and let
my people be rescued out of the hands of its enemy." Ahasuerus, thinking
these words were addressed to him, asked in irritation: "Who is he, and
where is he, this presumptuous conspirator, who thought to do thus?"
These were the first words the king had ever spoken to Esther herself.
Hitherto he had always communicated with her through an interpreter. He
had not been quite satisfied she was worthy enough to be addressed by
the king. Now made cognizant of the fact that she was a Jewess, and of
royal descent besides, he spoke to her directly, without the
intervention of others.

Esther stretched forth her hand to indicate the man who had sought to
take her life, as he had actually taken Vashti's, but in the excitement
of the moment, she pointed to the king. Fortunately the king did not
observe her error, because an angel guided her hand instantaneously in
the direction of Haman, whom her words described: "This is the adversary
and the enemy, he who desired to murder thee in thy sleeping-chamber
during the night just passed; he who this very day desired to array
himself in the royal apparel, ride upon thy horse, and wear they golden
crown upon his head, to rise up against thee and deprive thee of thy
sovereignty. But God set his undertaking at naught, and the honors he
sought for himself, fell to the share of my uncle Mordecai, who this
oppressor and enemy thought to hang."

The anger of the king already burnt so fiercely that he hinted to
Esther, that whether Haman was the adversary she had in mind or not, she
was to designate him as such. To infuriate him still more, God sent ten
angels in the guise of Haman's ten sons, to fell down the trees in the
royal park. When Ahasuerus turned his eyes toward the interior of the
park, he saw the ruthless destruction of which they were guilty. In his
rage he went out into the garden. This was the instant utilized by Haman
to implore grace for himself from Esther. Gabriel intervened, and threw
Haman upon the couch in a posture as though he were about to do violence
to the queen. At that moment Ahasuerus reappeared. Enraged beyond
description by what he saw, he cried out: "Haman attempts the honor of
the queen in my very presence! Come, then, ye peoples, nations, and
races, and pronounce judgment over him!"

When Harbonah, originally a friend of Haman and an adversary of
Mordecai, heard the king's angry exclamation, he said to him: "Nor is
this the only crime committed by Haman against thee, for he was an
accomplice of the conspirators Bigthan and Teresh, and his enmity to
Mordecai dates back to the time when Mordecai uncovered their foul
plots. Out of revenge therefor, he has erected a cross for him."
Harbonah's words illustrate the saying: "Once the ox has been cast to
the ground, slaughtering knives can readily be found." Knowing that
Haman had fallen from his high estate, Harbonah was intent upon winning
the friendship of Mordecai. Harbonah was altogether right, for Ahasuerus
at once ordered Haman to be hanged. Mordecai was charged with the
execution of the king's order, and Haman's tears and entreaties did not
in the least move him. He insisted upon hanging him like the commonest
of criminals, instead of executing him with the sword, the mode of
punishment applied to men of rank guilty of serious misdemeanors.

The cross which Haman, at the advice of his wife Zeresh and of his
friends, had erected for Mordecai, was now used for himself. It was made
of wood from a thorn-bush. God called all the trees together and
inquired which one would permit the cross for Haman to be made of it.
The fig-tree said: "I am ready to serve, for I am symbolic of Israel,
and, also, my fruits were brought to the Temple as firstfruits." The
vine said: "I am ready to serve, for I am symbolic of Israel and, also,
my wine is brought to the altar." The apple-tree said: "I am ready to
serve, for I am symbolic of Israel." The nut-tree said: "I am ready to
serve, for I am symbolic of Israel." The Etrog tree said: "I should have
the privilege, for with my fruit Israel praises God on Sukkot." The
willow of the brook said: "I desire to serve, for I am symbolic of
Israel." The cedar-tree said: "I desire to serve, for I am symbolic of
Israel." The palm-tree said: "I desire to serve, for I am symbolic of
Israel." Finally the thorn-bush came and said: "I am fitted to do this
service, for the ungodly are like pricking thorns." The offer of the
thorn-bush was accepted, after God gave a blessing to each of the other
trees for its willingness to serve.

A sufficiently long beam cut from a thorn-bush could be found only in
the house of Haman, which had to be demolished in order to obtain it.
The cross was tall enough for Haman and his ten sons to be hanged upon
it. It was planted three cubits deep in the ground, each of the victims
required three cubits space in length, one cubit space was left vacant
between the feet of the one above and the head of the one below, and the
youngest son, Vaizatha, had his feet four cubits from the ground as he
hung.

Haman and his ten sons remained suspended a long time, to the vexation
of those who considered it a violation of the Biblical prohibition in
Deuteronomy, not to leave a human body hanging upon a tree overnight.
Esther pointed to a precedent, the descendants of Saul, whom the
Gibeonites left hanging half a year, whereby the name of God was
sanctified, for whenever the pilgrims beheld them, they told the
heathen, that the men had been hanged because their father Saul had laid
hand on the Gibeonites. "How much more, then," continued Esther, "are we
justified in permitting Haman and his family to hang, they who desired
to destroy the house of Israel?"

Beside these ten sons, who had been governors in various provinces,
Haman had twenty others, ten of whom died, and the other ten of whom
were reduced to beggary. The vast fortune of which Haman died possessed
was divided in three parts. The first part was given to Mordecai and
Esther, the second to the students of the Torah, and the third was
applied to the restoration of the Temple. Mordecai thus became a wealthy
man. He was also set up as king of the Jews. As such he had coins
struck, which bore the figure of Esther on the obverse, and his own
figure on the reverse. However, in the measure in which Mordecai gained
in worldly power and consideration, he lost spiritually, because the
business connected with his high political station left him no time for
the study of the Torah. Previously he had ranked sixth among the eminent
scholars of Israel, he now dropped to the seventh place among them.
Ahasuerus, on the other hand, was the gainer by the change. As soon as
Mordecai entered upon the office of grand chancellor, he succeeded in
subjecting to his sway the provinces that had revolted on account of
Vashti's execution.

### THE EDICT OF THE KING

The edict issued against the Jews was revoked by Ahasuerus in the
following terms:

"King Ahasuerus sends this letter to all the inhabitants of water and
earth, to all the rulers of districts, and to generals of the army, who
dwell in every country; may your peace be great! I write this to you to
inform you, that although I rule over many nations, over the inhabitants
of land and sea, yet I am not proud of my power, but will rather walk in
lowliness and meekness of spirit all my days, in order to provide for
you great peace. Unto all who dwell under my dominion, unto all who seek
to carry on business on land or on sea, unto all who desire to export
goods from one nation to the other, from one people to the other unto
them all, I am the same, from one end of the earth to the other, and
none may seek to cause excitement on land or on sea, or enmities between
one nation and another, between one people and another. I write this,
because in spite of our sincerity and honesty with which we love all the
nations, revere all the rulers, and do good to all the potentates, there
are nevertheless people who were near to the king, and into whose hand
the government was entrusted, who by their intrigues and falsehoods
misled the king, and wrote letters which are not right before heaven,
which are evil before men, and harmful for the empire. This was the
petition they requested from the king: that righteous men should be
killed, and most innocent blood be shed, of those who have not done any
evil, nor were guilty of death such righteous people as Esther,
celebrated for all virtues, and Mordecai, wise in every branch of
wisdom, there is no blemish to be found in them nor in their nation. I
thought that I was requested concerning another nation, and did not know
it was concerning the Jews, who were called the Children of the Lord of
All, who created heaven and earth, and who led them and their fathers
through great and mighty empires. And now as he, Haman, the son of
Hammedatha, from Judea, a descendant of Amalek, who came to us and
enjoyed much kindness, praise, and dignity from us, whom we made great,
and called 'father of the king,' and seated him at the right of the
king, did not know how to appreciate the dignity, and how to conduct the
affairs of state, but harbored thoughts to kill the king and take away
his kingdom, therefore we ordered the son of Hammedatha to be hanged,
and all that he desired we have brought upon his head; and the Creator
of heaven and earth brought his machinations upon his head."

As a memorial of the wonderful deliverance from the hands of Haman, the
Jews of Shushan celebrated the day their arch-enemy had appointed for
their extermination, and their example was followed by the Jews of the
other cities of the Persian empire, and by those of other countries. Yet
the sages, when besought by Esther, refused at first to make it a
festival for all times, lest the hatred of the heathen be excited
against the Jews. They yielded only after Esther had pointed out to them
that the events on which the holiday was based, were perpetuated in the
annals of the kings of Persia and Media, and thus the outside world
would not be able to misinterpret the joy of the Jews.

Esther addressed another petition to the sages. She begged that the book
containing her history should be incorporated in the Holy Scriptures.
Because they shrank from adding anything to the triple Canon, consisting
of the Torah, the Prophets, and the Hagiographa, they again refused, and
again they had to yield to Esther's argument. She quoted the words from
Exodus, "Write this for a memorial in a book," spoken by Moses to
Joshua, after the battle of Rephidim with the Amalekites. They saw that
it was the will of God to immortalize the warfare waged with the
Amalekite Haman. Nor is the Book of Esther an ordinary history. Without
aid of the holy spirit, it could not have been composed, and therefore
its canonization resolved upon "below" was endorsed "above." And as the
Book of Esther became an integral and indestructible part of the Holy
Scriptures, so the Feast of Purim will be celebrated forever, now and in
the future world, and Esther herself by her pious deeds acquired a good
name both in this world and in the world to come.
