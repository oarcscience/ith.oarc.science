# X. THE EXILE

### ZEDEKIAH

The execution of one king and the deportation of another were but
preludes to the great national catastrophe in the time of Zedekiah, the
destruction of the Temple and the exile of the whole people. After
Nebuchadnezzar had led Jehoiachin and a portion of the people into
banishment, his commiseration was aroused for the Jews, and he inquired,
whether any other sons of Josiah were still living. Only Mattaniah was
left. He was re-named Zedekiah, in the hope that he would be the father
of pious sons. In reality the name became the omen of the disasters to
happen in the time of this king.

Nebuchadnezzar, who invested Zedekiah with the royal office, demanded
that he swear fealty to him. Zedekiah was about to swear by his own
soul, but the Babylonian king, not satisfied, brought a scroll of the
law, and made his Jewish vassal take the oath upon that. Nevertheless he
did not keep faith with Nebuchadnezzar for long. Nor was this his only
treachery toward his suzerain. He had once surprised Nebuchadnezzar in
the act of cutting a piece from a living hare and eating it, as is the
habit of barbarians. Nebuchadnezzar was painfully embarrassed, and he
begged the Jewish king to promise under oath not to mention what he had
seen. Though Nebuchadnezzar treated him with great friendliness, even
making him sovereign lord over five vassal kings, he did not justify the
trust reposed in him. To flatter Zedekiah, the five kings once said: "If
all were as it should be, thou wouldst occupy the throne of
Nebuchadnezzar." Zedekiah could not refrain from exclaiming: "O yes,
Nebuchadnezzar, whom I once saw eating a live hare!"

The five kings at once repaired to Nebuchadnezzar, and reported what
Zedekiah had said. Thereupon the king of Babylonia marched to Daphne,
near Antioch, with the purpose of chastising Zedekiah. At Daphne he
found the Sanhedrin of Jerusalem, who had hastened thither to receive
him. Nebuchadnezzar met the Sanhedrin courteously, ordered his
attendants to bring state chairs for all the members, and requested them
to read the Torah to him and explain it. When they reached the passage
in the Book of Numbers dealing with the remission of vows, the king put
the question: "If a man desires to be released from a vow, what steps
must he take?" The Sanhedrin replied: "He must repair to a scholar, and
he will absolve him from his vow." Whereupon Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed:
"I verily believe it was you who released Zedekiah from the vow he took
concerning me." And he ordered the members of the Sanhedrin to leave
their state chairs and sit on the ground. They were forced to admit,
that they had not acted in accordance with the law, for Zedekiah's vow
affected another beside himself, and without the acquiescence of the
other party, namely, Nebuchadnezzar, the Sanhedrin had no authority to
annul the vow.

Zedekiah was duly punished for the grievous crime of perjury. When
Jerusalem was captured, he tried to escape through a cave extending from
his house to Jericho. God sent a deer into the camp of the Chaldeans,
and in their pursuit of this game, the Babylonian soldiers reached the
farther opening of the cave at the very moment when Zedekiah was leaving
it. The Jewish king together with his ten sons was brought before
Nebuchadnezzar, who addressed Zedekiah thus: "Were I to judge thee
according to the law of thy God, thou wouldst deserve the death penalty,
for thou didst swear a false oath by the Name of God; no less wouldst
thou deserve death, if I were to judge thee according to the law of the
state, for thou didst fail in thy sworn duty to thy overlord."

Zedekiah requested the grace that his execution take place before his
children's, and he be spared the sight of their blood. His children, on
the other hand, besought Nebuchadnezzar to slay them before he slew
their father, that they might be spared the disgrace of seeing their
father executed. In his heartlessness Nebuchadnezzar had resolved worse
things than Zedekiah anticipated. In the sight of their father, the
children of Zedekiah were killed, and then Zedekiah himself was deprived
of sight; his eyes were blinded. He had been endowed with eyes of
superhuman strength, they were the eyes of Adam, and the iron lances
forced into them were powerless to destroy his sight. Vision left him
only because of the tears he shed over the fate of his children. Now he
realized how true Jeremiah had spoken when he had prophesied his exile
to Babylonia. Though he should live there until his death, he would
never behold the land with his eyes. On account of its seeming
contradictoriness, Zedekiah had thought the prophecy untrue. For this
reason he had not heeded Jeremiah's advice to make peace with
Nebuchadnezzar. Now it had all been verified; he was carried to
Babylonia a captive, yet, blind as he was, he did not see the land of
his exile.

### JEREMIAH

Though Zedekiah besmirched his career by perjury, he was nevertheless so
good and just a king that for his sake God relinquished his purpose of
returning the world to its original chaos, as a punishment for the
evil-doing of a wicked generation. In this depraved time, it was first
and foremost Jeremiah to whom was delegated the task of proclaiming the
word of God. He was a descendant of Joshua and Rahab, and his father was
the prophet Hilkiah. He was born while his father was fleeing from the
persecution of Jezebel, the murderess of prophets. At his very birth he
showed signs that he was destined to play a great part. He was born
circumcised, and scarcely had he left his mother's womb when he broke
into wailing, and his voice was the voice, not of a babe, but of a
youth. He cried: "My bowels, my bowels tremble, the walls of my heart
they are disquieted, my limbs quake, destruction upon destruction I
bring upon earth." In this strain he continued to moan and groan,
complaining of the faithlessness of his mother, and when she expressed
her amazement at the unseemly speech of her new-born son, Jeremiah said:
"Not thee do I mean, my mother, not to thee doth my prophecy refer; I
speak of Zion, and against Jerusalem are my words directed. She adorns
her daughters, arrays them in purple, and puts golden crowns upon their
heads. Robbers will come and strip them of their ornaments."

As a lad he received the call to be a prophet. But he refused to obey,
saying: "O Lord, I cannot go as a prophet to Israel, for when lived
there a prophet whom Israel did not desire to kill? Moses and Aaron they
sought to stone with stones; Elijah the Tishbite they mocked at because
his hair was grown long; and they called after Elisha, 'Go up, thou bald
head' no, I cannot go to Israel, for I am still naught but a lad." God
replied: "I love youth, for it is innocent. When I carried Israel out of
Egypt, I called him a lad, and when I think of Israel lovingly, I speak
of him as a lad. Say not, therefore, thou art only a lad, but thou shalt
go on whatsoever errand I shall send thee. Now, then," God, continued,
"take the 'cup of wrath,' and let the nations drink of it." Jeremiah put
the question which land was to drink first from the "cup of wrath," and
the answer of God was: "First Jerusalem is to drink, the head of all
earthly nations, and then the cities of Judah." When the prophet heard
this, he began to curse the day of his birth. "I am like the high
priest," he said, "who has to administer the 'water of bitterness' to a
woman who is held under the suspicion of adultery, and when he
approaches the woman with the cup, lo, he beholds his own mother. And I,
O Mother Zion, thought, when I was called to prophesy, that I was
appointed to proclaim prosperity and salvation to thee, but now I see
that my message forebodes thee evil."

Jeremiah's first appearance in public was during the reign of Josiah,
when he announced to the people in the streets: "If ye will give up your
wicked doings, God will raise you above all nations; if not, He will
deliver His house into the hands of the enemies, and they will deal with
it as seemeth best to them."

The prophets contemporary with Jeremiah in his early years were
Zechariah and Huldah. The province of the latter was among women, while
Zechariah was active in the synagogue. Later, under Jehoiakim, Jeremiah
was supported by the prophets of his relative Uriah of Kiriathjearim, a
friend of the prophet Isaiah. But Uriah was put to death by the ungodly
king, the same who had the first chapter of Lamentations burnt after
obliterating the Name of God wherever it occurs in the whole book. But
Jeremiah added four chapters.

The prophet fell upon evil times under Zedekiah. He had both the people
and the court against him. Nor was that surprising in a day when not
even the high priests in the Temple bore the sign of the covenant upon
their bodies. Jeremiah had called forth general hostility by condemning
the alliance with Egypt against Babylonia, and favoring peace with
Nebuchadnezzar; and this though to all appearances the help of the
Egyptians would prove of good effect for the Jews. The hosts of Pharaoh
Necho had actually set forth from Egypt to join the Jews against
Babylon. But when they were on the high seas, God commanded the waters
to cover themselves with corpses. Astonished, the Egyptians asked each
other, whence the dead bodies. Presently the answer occurred to them:
they were the bodies of their ancestors drowned in the Red Sea on
account of the Jews, who had shaken off Egyptian rule. "What," said the
Egyptians thereupon, "shall we bring help to those who drowned our
fathers?" So they returned to their own country, justifying the warning
of Jeremiah, that no dependence could be put upon Egyptian promises.

A little while after this occurrence, when Jeremiah wanted to leave
Jerusalem to go to Anathoth and partake of his priestly portion there,
the watchman at the gate accused him of desiring to desert to the enemy.
He was delivered to his adversaries at court, and they confined him in
prison. The watchman knew full well that it was a trumped up charge he
was bringing against Jeremiah, and the intention attributed to him was
as far as possible from the mind of the prophet, but he took this
opportunity to vent an old family grudge. For this gateman was a
grandson of the false prophet Hananiah, the enemy of Jeremiah, the one
who had prophesied complete victory over Nebuchadnezzar within two
years. It were proper to say, he calculated the victory rather than
prophesied it. He reasoned: "If unto Elam, which is a mere ally of the
Babylonians against the Jews, destruction has been appointed by God
through Jeremiah, so much the more will the extreme penalty fall upon
the Babylonians themselves, who have inflicted vast evil upon the Jews."
Jeremiah's prophecy had been the reverse: so far from holding forth any
hope that a victory would be won over Nebuchadnezzar, the Jewish state,
he said, would suffer annihilation. Hananiah demanded a sign betokening
the truth of Jeremiah's prophecy. But Jeremiah contended there could be
no sign for such a prophecy as his, since the Divine determination to do
evil can be annulled. On the other hand, it was the duty of Hananiah to
give a sign, for he was prophesying pleasant things, and the Divine
resolution for good is executed without. Finally, Jeremiah advanced the
clinching argument: "I, a priest, may be well content with the prophecy;
it is to my interest that the Temple should continue to stand. As for
thee, thou art a Gibeonite, thou wilt have to do a slave's service in it
so long as there is a Temple. But instead of troubling thy mind with the
future in store for others, thou shouldst rather have thought of thine
own future, for this very year thou wilt die." Hananiah, in very truth,
died on the last day of the year set as his term of life, but before his
death he ordered that it should be kept secret for two days, so to give
the lie to Jeremiah's prophecy. With his last words, addressed to his
son Shelemiah, he charged him to seek every possible way of taking
revenge upon Jeremiah, to whose curse his death was to be ascribed.
Shelemiah had no opportunity of fulfilling his father's last behest, but
it did not pass from his mind, and when he, in turn, lay upon his
death-bed, he impressed the duty of revenge upon his son Jeriah. It was
the grandson of Hananiah who, when he saw Jeremiah leaving the city,
hastened to take the opportunity of accusing the prophet of treason. His
purpose prospered. The aristocratic enemies of Jeremiah, enraged against
him, welcomed the chance to put him behind prison bars, and gave him in
charge of a jailer, Jonathan, who had been a friend of the false prophet
Hananiah. Jonathan pleased himself by mocking at his prisoner: "See," he
would say, "see what honor thy friend does thee, to put thee in so fine
a prison as this; verily, it is a royal palace."

Despite his suffering, Jeremiah did not hold back the truth. When the
king inquired of him, whether he had a revelation from God, he replied:
"Yes, the king of Babylonia will carry thee off into exile." To avoid
irritating the king, he went into no further detail. He only prayed the
king to liberate him from prison, saying: "Even wicked men like Hananiah
and his descendants at least cast about for a pretext when they desire
to take revenge, and their example ought not to be lost upon thee who
art called Zedekiah, 'just man.'" The king granted his petition, but
Jeremiah did not enjoy liberty for long. Hardly out of prison, he again
advised the people to surrender, and the nobility seized him and cast
him into a lime pit filled with water, where they hoped he would drown.
But a miracle happened. The water sank to the bottom, and the mud rose
to the surface, and supported the prophet above the water. Help came to
him from Ebed-melech, a "white raven," the only pious man at court.
Ebed-melech hastened to the king and spoke: "Know, if Jeremiah perishes
in the lime pit, Jerusalem will surely be captured." With the permission
of the king, Ebed-melech went to the pit, and cried out aloud several
times, "O my lord Jeremiah," but no answer came. Jeremiah feared the
words were spoken by his former jailer Jonathan, who had not given up
his practice of mocking at the prophet. He would come to the edge of the
pit and call down jeeringly: "Do not rest thy head on the mud, and take
a little sleep, Jeremiah." To such sneers Jeremiah made no reply, and
hence it was that Ebed-melech was left unanswered. Thinking the prophet
dead, he began to lament and tear his clothes. Then Jeremiah, realizing
that it was a friend, and not Jonathan, asked: "Who is it that is
calling my name and weeps therewith?" and he received the assurance that
Ebed-melech had come to rescue him from his perilous position.

### NEBUCHADNEZZAR

The suffering to which Jeremiah was exposed was finally ended by the
capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. This Babylonian king was a son
of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. His first contact with the Jews
happened in the time of his father-in-law Sennacherib, whom he
accompanied on his campaign against Hezekiah. The destruction of the
Assyrian army before the walls of Jerusalem, the great catastrophe from
which only Nebuchadnezzar and four others escaped with their life,
inspired him with fear of God. Later, in his capacity as secretary to
the Babylonian king Merodach-baladan, it was he who called his master's
notice to the mention of the Jewish king's name before the Name of God.
"Thou callest Him 'the great God,' yet thou dost name Him after the
king," he said. Nebuchadnezzar himself hastened after the messenger to
bring back the letter and have it changed. He had advanced scarce three
steps when he was restrained by the angel Gabriel, for even the few
paces he had walked for the glory of God earned him his great power over
Israel. A further step would have extended his ability to inflict harm
immeasurably.

For eighteen years daily a heavenly voice resounded in the palace of
Nebuchadnezzar, saying: "O thou wicked slave, go and destroy the house
of thy Lord, for His children hearken not unto Him." But Nebuchadnezzar
was beset with fears lest God prepare a fate for him similar to that of
his ancestor Sennacherib. He practiced belomancy and consulted other
auguries, to assure himself that he was against Jerusalem would result
favorably. When he shook up the arrows, and questioned whether he was to
go to Rome or Alexandria, not one arrow sprang up, but when he
questioned about Jerusalem, one sprang up. He sowed seeds and set out
planets; for Rome or Alexandria nothing came up; for Jerusalem
everything sprouted and grew. He lighted candles and lanterns; for Rome
or Alexandria they refused to burn, for Jerusalem they shed their light.
He floated vessels on the Euphrates; for Rome or Alexandria they did not
move, for Jerusalem they swam.

Still the fears of Nebuchadnezzar were not allayed. His determination to
attack the Holy City ripened only after God Himself had shown him how He
had bound the hands of the archangel Michael, the patron of the Jews,
behind his back, in order to render him powerless to bring to his wards.
So the campaign against Jerusalem was undertaken.

### THE CAPTURE OF JERUSALEM

If the Babylonians thought that the conquest of Jerusalem was an easy
task, they were greatly mistaken. For three years God endured the
inhabitants with strength to withstand the onslaughts of the enemy, in
the hope that the Jews would amend their evil ways and abandon their
godless conduct, so that the threatened punishment might be annulled.

Among the many heroes in the beleaguered city that was bidding defiance
to the Babylonians, one by the name of Akiba was particularly
distinguished. The stones were hurled at the walls of the city from the
catapults wielded by the enemy without, he was wont to catch on his
feet, and throw them back upon the besiegers. Once it happened that a
stone was so cast as to drop, not upon the wall, but in front of it. In
his swift race toward it, Akiba was precipitated into the space between
the inner and the outer wall. He quickly reassured his friends in the
city, that his fall had in no wise harmed him. He was only a little
shaken up and weak; as soon as he had his accustomed daily meal, a
roasted ox, he would be able to scale the wall and resume the struggle
with the Babylonians. But human strength and artifice avail naught
against God. A gust of wind arose, and Akiba was thrown from the wall,
and he died. Thereupon the Chaldeans made a breach in the wall, and
penetrated into the city.

Equally fruitless were the endeavors of Hanamel, the uncle of Jeremiah,
to save the city. He conjured the angels up, armed them, and had them
occupy the walls. The Chaldeans retreated in terror at the sight of the
heavenly host. But God changed the names of the angels, and brought them
back to heaven. Hanamel's exorcisms availed naught. When he called the
Angel of the Water, for instance, the response would come from the Angel
of Fire, who bore the former name of his companion. Then Hanamel
resorted to the extreme measure of summoning the Prince of the World,
who raised Jerusalem high up in the air. But God thrust the city down
again, and the enemy entered unhindered.

Nevertheless, the capture of the city could not have been accomplished
if Jeremiah had been present. His deeds were as a firm pillar for the
city, and his prayers as a stony wall. Therefore God sent the prophet on
an errand out of the city. He was made to go to his native place,
Anathoth, to take possession of a field, his by right of inheritance.
Jeremiah rejoiced; he took this as a sign that God would be gracious to
Judah, else He would not have commanded him to take possession of a
piece of land. Scarcely had the prophet left Jerusalem when an angel
descended upon the wall of the city and caused a breach to appear, at
the same time crying out: "Let the enemy come and enter the house, for
the Master of the house is no longer therein. The enemy has leave to
despoil it and destroy it. Go ye into the vineyard and snap the vines
asunder, for the Watchman hath gone away and abandoned it. But let no
man boast and say, he and his have vanquished the city. Nay, a conquered
city have ye conquered, a dead people have ye killed."

The enemy rushed in and ascended the Temple mount, and on the spot
whereon King Solomon had been in the habit of sitting when he took
counsel with the elders, the Chaldeans plotted how to reduce the Temple
to ashes. During their sinister deliberations, they beheld four angels,
each with a flaming torch in his hand, descending and setting fire to
the four corners of the Temple. The high priest, seeing the flames shoot
up, cast the keys of the Temple heavenward, saying: "Here are the keys
of Thy house; it seems I am an untrustworthy custodian," and, as he
turned, he was seized by the enemy and slaughtered in the very place on
which he had been wont to offer the daily sacrifice. With him perished
his daughter, her blood mingling with her father's. The priests and the
Levites threw themselves into the flames with their harps and trumpets,
and, to escape the violence feared from the licentious Chaldeans, the
virgins who wove the curtains for the sanctuary followed their example.
Still more horrible was the carnage caused among the people by
Nebuzaradan, spurred on as he was by the sight of the blood of the
murdered prophet Zechariah seething on the floor of the Temple. At first
the Jews sought to conceal the true story connected with the blood. At
length they had to confess, that it was the blood of a prophet who had
prophesied the destruction of the Temple, and for his candor had been
slain by the people. Nebuzaradan, to appease the prophet, ordered the
scholars of the kingdom to be executed first on the bloody spot, then
the school children, and at last the young priests, more than a million
souls in all. But the blood of the prophet went on seething and reeking,
until Nebuzaradan exclaimed: "Zechariah, Zechariah, the good in Israel I
have slaughtered. Dost thou desire the destruction of the whole people?"
Then the blood ceased to seethe.

Nebuzaradan was startled by the thought, if the Jews, who had a single
life upon their conscience, were made to atone so cruelly, what would be
his own fate! He left Nebuchadnezzar and became a proselyte.

### THE GREAT LAMENT

On his return from Anathoth, Jeremiah saw, at a distance, smoke curling
upward from the Temple mount, and his spirit was joyful. He thought the
Jews had repented of their sins, and were bringing incense offerings.
Once within the city walls, he knew the truth, that the Temple had
fallen a prey to the incendiary. Overwhelmed by grief, he cried out: "O
Lord, Thou didst entice me, and I permitted myself to be enticed; Thou
didst send me forth out of Thy house that Thou mightest destroy it."

God Himself was deeply moved by the destruction of the Temple, which He
had abandoned that the enemy might enter and destroy it. Accompanied by
the angels, He visited the ruins, and gave vent to His sorrow: "Woe is
Me on account of My house. Where are My children, where My priests,
where My beloved? But what could I do for you? Did I not warn you? Yet
you would not mend your ways." "To-day," God said to Jeremiah, "I am
like a man who has an only son. He prepares the marriage canopy for him,
and his only beloved dies under it. Thou doest seem to feel but little
sympathy with Me and with My children. Go, summon Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
and Moses from their graces. They know how to mourn." "Lord of the
world," replied Jeremiah, "I know not where Moses is buried." "Stand on
the banks of the Jordan," said God, "and cry: 'Thou son of Amram, son of
Amram, arise, see how wolves have devoured thy sheep.'"

Jeremiah repaired to the Double Cave, and spake to the Patriarchs:
"Arise, ye are summoned to appear before God." When they asked him the
reason of the summons, he feigned ignorance, for he feared to tell them
the true reason; they might have cast reproaches upon him that so great
a disaster had overtaken Israel in his time. Then Jeremiah journeyed on
to the banks of the Jordan, and there he called as he had been bidden:
"Thou son of Amram, son of Amram, arise, thou are cited to appear before
God." "What has happened this day, that God calls me unto Him?" asked
Moses. "I know not," replied Jeremiah again. Moses thereupon went to the
angels, and from them he learned that the Temple had been destroyed, and
Israel banished from his land. Weeping and mourning, Moses joined the
Patriarchs, and together, rending their garments and wringing their
hands, they betook themselves to the ruins of the Temple. Here their
wailing was augmented by the loud lamentations of the angels: "How
desolate are the highways to Jerusalem, the highways destined for travel
without end! How deserted are the streets that once were thronged at the
seasons of the pilgrimages! O Lord of the world, with Abraham the father
of Thy people, who taught the world to know Thee as the ruler of the
universe, Thou didst make a covenant, that through him and his
descendants the earth should be filled with people, and now Thou hast
dissolved Thy covenant with him. O Lord of the world! Thou hast scorned
Zion and Jerusalem, once Thy chosen habitation. Thou hast dealt more
harshly with Israel than with the generation of Enosh, the first
idolaters."

God thereupon said to the angels: "Why do ye array yourselves against Me
with your complaints?" "Lord do the world," they replied, "on account of
Abraham, Thy beloved, who has come into Thy house wailing and weeping,
yet Thou payest no heed unto him." Thereupon God: "Since My beloved
ended his earthly career, he has not been in My house. 'What hath My
beloved to do in My house'?"

Now Abraham entered into the conversation: "Why, O Lord of the world,
hast Thou exiled my children, delivered them into the hands of the
nations, who torture them with all tortures, and who have rendered
desolate the sanctuary, where I was ready to bring Thee my son Isaac as
a sacrifice?" "Thy children have sinned," said God, "they have
transgressed the whole Torah, they have offended against every letter of
it." Abraham: "Who is there that will testify against Israel, that he
has transgressed the Torah?" God: "Let the Torah herself appear and
testify." The Torah came, and Abraham addressed her: "O my daughter,
dost thou indeed come to testify against Israel, to say that he violated
thy commandments? Dost thou feel no shame? Remember the day on which God
offered thee to all the peoples, all the nations of the earth, and they
all rejected thee with disdain. Then my children came to Sinai, they
accepted thee, and they honored thee. And now, on the day of their
distress, thou standest up against them?" Hearing this, the Torah
stepped aside, and did not testify. "Let the twenty-two letters of the
Hebrew alphabet in which Torah is written come and testify against
Israel," said God. They appeared without delay, and Alef, the first
letter, was about to testify against Israel, when Abraham interrupted it
with the words: "Thou chief of all letters, thou comest to testify
against Israel in the time of his distress? Be mindful of the day on
which God revealed Himself on Mount Sinai, beginning His words with
thee: 'Anoki the Lord thy God.' No people, no nation accepted thee, only
my children, and now thou comest to testify against them!" Alef stepped
aside and was silent. The same happened with the second letter Bet, and
with the third, Gimel, and with all the rest all of them retired
abashed, and opened not their mouth. Now Abraham turned to God and said:
"O Lord of the world! When I was a hundred years old, Thou didst give me
a son, and when he was in the flower of his age, thirty-seven years old,
Thou didst command me to sacrifice him to Thee, and I, like a monster,
without compassion, I bound him upon the altar with mine own hands. Let
that plead with Thee, and have Thou pity on my children."

Then Isaac raised his voice and spake: "O Lord of the world, when my
father told me, 'God will provide Himself the lamb for a burnt offering,
my son,' I did not resist Thy word. Willingly I let myself be tied to
the altar, my throat was raised to meet the knife. Let that plead with
Thee, and have Thou pity on my children."

Then Jacob raised his voice and spake: "O Lord of the world, for twenty
years I dwelt in the house of Laban, and when I left it, I met with
Esau, who sought to murder my children, and I risked my life for theirs.
And now they are delivered into the hands of their enemies, like sheep
led to the shambles, after I coddled them like fledglings breaking forth
from their shells, after I suffered anguish for their sake all the days
of my life. Let that plead with Thee, and have Thou pity on my
children."

And at last Moses raised his voice and spake: "O Lord of the world, was
I not a faithful shepherd unto Israel for forty long years? Like a steed
I ran ahead of him in the desert, and when the time came for him to
enter the Promised Land, Thou didst command: 'Here in the desert shall
thy bones drop!' And now that the children of Israel are exiled, Thou
hast sent for me to mourn and lament over them. That is what the people
mean when they say: The good fortune of the master is none for the
slave, but the master's woe is his woe." And turning to Jeremiah, he
continued: "Walk before me, I will lead them back; let us see who will
venture to raise a hand against them." Jeremiah replied: "The roads
cannot be passed, they are blocked with corpses." But Moses was not to
be deterred, and the two, Moses following Jeremiah, reached the rivers
of Babylon. When the Jews saw Moses, they said: "The son of Amram has
ascended from his grave to redeem us from our enemies." At that moment a
heavenly voice was heard to cry out: "It is decreed!" And Moses said: "O
my children, I cannot redeem you, the decree is unalterable may God
redeem you speedily," and he departed from them.

The children of Israel raised their voices in sore lamentations, and the
sound of their grief pierced to the very heavens. Meantime Moses
returned to the Fathers, and reported to them to what dire suffering the
exiled Jews were exposed, and they all broke out into woe-begone
plaints. In his bitter grief, Moses exclaimed: "Be cursed, O sun, why
was not thy light extinguished in the hour in which the enemy invaded
the sanctuary?" The sun replied: "O faithful shepherd, I sware by the
life, I could not grow dark. The heavenly powers would not permit it.
Sixty fiery scourges they dealt me, and they said, 'Go and let thy light
shine forth,'" Another last complaint Moses uttered: "O Lord of the
world, Thou hast written it in Thy Torah: 'And whether it be cow or ewe,
ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.' How many mothers
have they slaughtered with their children and Thou art silent!"

Then, with the suddenness of a flash, Rachel, our mother, stood before
the Holy One, blessed be He: "Lord of the world," she said, "Thou
knowest how overwhelming was Jacob's love for me, and when I observed
that my father thought to put Leah in my place, I gave Jacob secret
signs, that the plan of my father might be set at naught. But then I
repented me of what I had done, and to spare my sister mortification, I
disclosed the signs to her. More than this, I myself was in the bridal
chamber, and when Jacob spake with Leah, I made reply, lest her voice
betray her. I, a woman, a creature of flesh and blood, of dust and
ashes, was not jealous of my rival. Thou, O God, everlasting King, Thou
eternal and merciful Father, why wast Thou jealous of the idols, empty
vanities? Why hast Thou driven out my children, slain them with swords,
left them at the mercy of their enemies?" Then the compassion of the
Supreme God was awakened, and He said: "For thy sake, O Rachel, I will
lead the children of Israel back to their land."

### JEREMIAH'S JOURNEY TO BABYLON

When Nebuchadnezzar dispatched his general Nebuzaradan to the capture of
Jerusalem, he gave him three instructions regarding the mild treatment
of Jeremiah: "Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do
unto him even as he shall say unto thee." At the same time he enjoined
him to use pitiless cruelty toward the rest of the people. But the
prophet desired to share the fate of his suffering brethren, and when he
saw a company of youths in the pillory, he put his own head into it.
Nebuzaradan would always withdraw him again. Thereafter if Jeremiah saw
a company of old men clapped in chains, he would join them and share
their ignominy, until Nebuzaradan released him. Finally, Nebuzaradan
said to Jeremiah: "Lo, thou art one of three things; either thou are a
prophesier of false things, or thou art a despiser of suffering, or thou
art a shedder of blood. A prophesier of false things for since many a
year hast thou been prophesying the downfall of this city, and now, when
thy prophecy has come true, thou sorrowest and mournest. Or a despiser
of suffering for I seek to do thee naught harmful, and thou thyself
pursuest what is harmful to thee, as thou to say, 'I am indifferent to
pain.' Or a shedder of blood for the king has charged me to have a care
of thee, and let no harm come upon thee, but as thou insistest upon
seeking evil for thyself, it must be that the king may hear of thy
misfortune, and put me to death."

At first Jeremiah refused Nebuzaradan's offer to let him remain in
Palestine. He joined the march of the captives going to Babylon, along
the highways streaming with blood and strewn with corpses. When they
arrived at the borders of the Holy Land, they all, prophet and people,
broke out into loud wails, and Jeremiah said: "Yes, brethren and
countrymen, all this hath befallen you, because ye did not hearken unto
the words of my prophecy." Jeremiah journeyed with them until they came
to the banks of the Euphrates. Then God spoke to the prophet: "Jeremiah,
if thou remainest here, I shall go with them, and if thou goest with
them, I shall remain here." Jeremiah replied: "Lord of the world, if I
go with them, what doth it avail them? Only if their King, their Creator
accompanies them, will it bestead them."

When the captives saw Jeremiah make preparations to return to Palestine,
they began to weep and cry: "O Father Jeremiah, wilt thou, too, abandon
us?" "I call heaven and earth to witness," said the prophet, "had you
wept but once in Zion, ye had not been driven out."

Beset with terrors was the return journey for the prophet. Corpses lay
everywhere, and Jeremiah gathered up all the fingers that lay about; he
strained them to his heart, fondled them, kissed them, and wrapped them
in his mantle, saying sadly: "Did I not tell you, my children, did I not
say to you, 'Give glory to the Lord your God, before He cause darkness,
and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains'?"

Dejected, oppressed by his grief, Jeremiah saw the fulfilment of his
prophecy against the coquettish maidens of Jerusalem, who had pursued
but the pleasures and enjoyments of the world. How often had the prophet
admonished them to do penance and lead a God-fearing life! In vain;
whenever he threatened them with the destruction of Jerusalem, they
said: "Why should we concern ourselves about it?" "A prince will take me
unto wife," said one, the other, "A prefect will marry me." And at first
it seemed the expectations of Jerusalem's fair daughters would be
realized, for the most aristocratic of the victorious Chaldeans were
charmed by the beauty of the women of Jerusalem, and offered them their
hand and their rank. But God sent disfiguring and repulsive diseases
upon the women, and the Babylonians cast them off, threw them violently
out of their chariots, and ruthlessly drove them over the prostrate
bodies.

### TRANSPORTATION OF THE CAPTIVES

Nebuchadnezzar's orders were to hurry the captives along the road to
Babylon without stop or stay. He feared the Jews might else find
opportunity to supplicate the mercy of God, and He, compassionate as He
is, would release them instantly they did penance. Accordingly, there
was no pause in the forward march, until the Euphrates was reached.
There they were within the borders of the empire of Nebuchadnezzar, and
he thought he had nothing more to fear.

Many of the Jews died as soon as they drank of the Euphrates. In their
native land they had been accustomed to the water drawn from springs and
wells. Mourning over their dead and over the others that had fallen by
the way, they sat on the banks of the river, while Nebuchadnezzar and
his princes on their vessels celebrated their victory amid song and
music. The king noticed that the princes of Judah, though they were in
chains, bore no load upon their shoulders, and he called to his
servants: "Have you no load for these?" They took the parchment scrolls
of the law, tore them in pieces, made sacks of them, and filled them
with sand; these they loaded upon the backs of the Jewish princes. At
sight of this disgrace, all Israel broke out into loud weeping. The
voice of their sorrow pierced the very heavens, and God determined to
turn the world once more into chaos, for He told Himself, that after all
the world was created but for the sake of Israel. The angels hastened
thither, and they spake before God: "O Lord of the world, the universe
is Thine. Is it not enough that Thou hast dismembered Thy earthly house,
the Temple? Wilt Thou destroy Thy heavenly house, too?" God restraining
them said: "Do ye think I am a creature of flesh and blood, and stand in
need of consolation? Do I not know beginning and end of all things? Go
rather and remove their burdens from the princes of Judah." Aided by God
the angels descended, and they carried the loads put upon the Jewish
captives until they reached Babylon.

On their way, they passed the city of Bari. The inhabitants thereof were
not a little astonished at the cruelty of Nebuchadnezzar, who made the
captives march naked. The people of Bari stripped their slaves of their
clothes, and presented the slaves to Nebuchadnezzar. When the king
expressed his astonishment thereat, they said: "We thought thou wert
particularly pleased with naked men." The king at once ordered the Jews
to be arrayed in their garments. The reward accorded the Bariites was
that God endowed them forever with beauty and irresistible grace.

The compassionate Bariites did not find many imitators. The very
opposite quality was displayed by the Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, and
Arabs. Despite their close kinship with Israel, their conduct toward the
Jews was dictated by cruelty. The two first-mentioned, the Ammonites and
the Moabites, when they heard the prophet foretell the destruction of
Jerusalem, hastened without a moment's delay to report it to
Nebuchadnezzar, and urge him to attack Jerusalem. The scruples of the
Babylonian king, who feared God, and all the reasons he advanced against
a combat with Israel, they refuted, and finally they induced him to act
as they wished. At the capture of the city, while all the strange
nations were seeking booty, the Ammonites and the Moabites threw
themselves into the Temple to seize the scroll of the law, because it
contained the clause against their entering into the "assembly of the
Lord even to the tenth generation." To disgrace the faith of Israel,
they plucked the Cherubim from the Holy of Holies and dragged them
through the streets of Jerusalem, crying aloud at the same time: "Behold
these sacred things that belong to the Israelites, who say ever they
have no idols."

The Edomites were still more hostile in the hour of Israel's need. They
went to Jerusalem with Nebuchadnezzar, but they kept themselves at a
distance from the city, there to await the outcome of the battle between
the Jews and the Babylonians. If the Jews had been victorious, they
would have pretended they had come to bring them aid. When
Nebuchadnezzar's victory became known, they showed their true feelings.
Those who escaped the sword of the Babylonians, were hewn down by the
hand of the Edomites.

But in fiendish cunning these nations were surpassed by the Ishmaelites.
Eighty thousand young priests, each with a golden shield upon his
breast, succeeded in making their way through the ranks of
Nebuchadnezzar and in reaching the Ishmaelites. They asked for water to
drink. The reply of the Ishmaelites was: "First eat, and then you may
drink," at the same time handing them salt food. Their thirst was
increased, and the Ishmaelites gave them leather bags filled with
nothing but air instead of water. When they raised them to their mouths,
the air entered their bodies, and they fell dead.

Other Arabic tribes showed their hostility openly; as the Palmyrenes,
who put eighty thousand archers at the disposal of Nebuchadnezzar in his
war against Israel.

### THE SONS OF MOSES

If Nebuchadnezzar thought, that once he had the Jews in the regions of
the Euphrates they were in his power forever, he was greatly mistaken.
It was on the very banks of the great river that he suffered the loss of
a number of his captives. When the first stop was made by the Euphrates,
the Jews could no longer contain their grief, and they broke out into
tears and bitter lamentations. Nebuchadnezzar bade them be silent, and
as though to render obedience to his orders the harder, he called upon
the Levites, the minstrels of the Temple to sing the songs of Zion for
the entertainment of his guests at the banquet he had arranged. The
Levites consulted with one another. "Not enough that the Temple lies in
ashes because of our sins, should we add to our transgressions by
coaxing music from the strings of our holy harps in honor of these
'dwarfs'?" they said, and they determined to offer resistance. The
murderous Babylonians mowed them down in heaps, yet they met death with
high courage, for it saved their sacred instruments from the desecration
of being used before idols and for the sake of idolaters.

The Levites who survived the carnage the Sons of Moses they were bit
their own fingers off, and when they were asked to play, they showed
their tyrants mutilated hands, with which it was impossible to
manipulate their harps. At the fall of night a cloud descended and
enveloped the Sons of Moses and all who belonged to them. They were
hidden from their enemies, while their own way was illuminated by a
pillar of fire. The cloud and the pillar vanished at break of day, and
before the Sons of Moses lay a tract of land bordered by the sea on
three sides. For their complete protection God made the river Sambation
to flow on the fourth side. This river is full of sand and stones, and
on the six working days of the week, they tumble over each other with
such vehemence that the crash and the roar are heard far and wide. But
on the Sabbath the tumultuous river subsides into quiet. As a guard
against trespassers on that day, a column of cloud stretches along the
whole length of the river, and none can approach the Sambation within
three miles. Hedged in as they are, the Sons of Moses yet communicate
with their brethren of the tribes of Naphtali, Gad, and Asher, who dwell
near the banks of the Sambation. Carrier pigeons bear letters hither and
thither.

In the land of the Sons of Moses there are none but clean animals, and
in every respect the inhabitants lead a holy and pure life, worthy of
their ancestor Moses. They never use an oath, and, if perchance an oath
escapes the lips of one of them, he is at once reminded of the Divine
punishment connected with his act his children will die at a tender age.

The Sons of Moses live peaceably and enjoy prosperity as equals through
their common Jewish faith. They have need of neither prince nor judge,
for they know not strife and litigation. Each works for the welfare of
the community, and each takes from the common store only what will
satisfy his needs. Their houses are built of equal height, that no one
may deem himself above his neighbor, and that that the fresh air may not
be hindered from playing freely about all alike. Even at night their
doors stand wide open, for they have naught to fear from thieves, nor
are wild animals known in their land. They all attain a good old age.
The son never dies before the father. When a death occurs, there is
rejoicing, because the departed is known to have entered into life
everlasting in loyalty to his faith. The birth of a child, on the other
hand, calls forth mourning, for who can tell whether the being ushered
into the world will be pious and faithful? The dead are buried near the
doors of their own houses, in order that their survivors, in all their
comings and goings, may be reminded of their own end. Disease is unknown
among them, for they never sin, and sickness is sent only to purify from
sins.

### EBED-MELECH

The Sons of Moses were not the only ones to escape from under the heavy
hand of Nebuchadnezzar. Still more miraculous was the deliverance of the
pious Ethiopian Ebed-melech from the hands of the Babylonians. He was
saved as a reward for rescuing Jeremiah when the prophet's life was
jeopardized. On the day before the destruction of the Temple, shortly
before the enemy forced his way into the city, the Ethiopian was sent,
by the prophet Jeremiah acting under Divine instruction, to a certain
place in front of the gates of the city, to dole out refreshments to the
poor from a little basket of figs he was to carry with him. Ebed-melech
reached the spot, but the heat was so intense that he fell asleep under
a tree, and there he slept for sixty-six years. When he woke up, the
figs were still fresh and juicy, but all the surroundings had so
changed, he could not make out where he was. His confusion increased
when he entered the city to seek Jeremiah, and found nothing as it had
been. He accosted an old man, and asked him the name of the place. When
he was told it was Jerusalem, Ebed-melech cried out in amazement: "Where
is Jeremiah, where is Baruch, and where are all the people?" The old man
was not a little astonished at these questions. How was it possible that
one who had known Jeremiah and Jerusalem should be ignorant of the
events that had passed sixty years before? In brief words he told
Ebed-melech of the destruction of the Temple and of the captivity of the
people, but what he said found no credence with his auditor. Finally
Ebed-melech realized that God had performed a great miracle for him, so
that he had been spared the sight of Israel's misfortune.

While he was pouring out his heart in gratitude to God, an eagle
descended and led him to Baruch, who lived not far from the city.
Thereupon Baruch received the command from God to write to Jeremiah that
the people should remove the strangers from the midst of them, and then
God would lead them back to Jerusalem. The letter written by Baruch and
some of the figs that had retained their freshness for sixty-six years
were carried to Babylonia by an eagle, who had told Baruch that he had
been sent to serve him as a messenger. The eagle set out on his journey.
His first halting-place was a dreary waste spot to which he knew
Jeremiah and the people would come it was the burial-place of the Jews
which Nebuchadnezzar had given the prophet at his solicitation. When the
eagle saw Jeremiah and the people approach with a funeral train, he
cried out: "I have a message for thee, Jeremiah. Let all the people draw
nigh to receive the good tidings." As a sign that his mission was true,
the eagle touched the corpse, and it came to life. Amidst tears all the
people cried unto Jeremiah: "Save us! What must we do to return to our
land?"

The eagle brought Jeremiah's answer to Baruch, and after the prophet had
sent the Babylonian women away, he returned to Jerusalem with the
people. Those who would not submit to the orders of Jeremiah relative to
the heathen women, were not permitted by the prophet to enter the holy
city, and as they likewise were not permitted to return to Babylonia,
they founded the city of Samaria near Jerusalem.

### THE TEMPLE VESSELS

The task laid upon Jeremiah had been twofold. Besides giving him charge
over the people in the land of their exile, God had entrusted to him the
care of the sanctuary and all it contained. The holy Ark, the altar of
incense, and the holy tent were carried by an angel to the mount whence
Moses before his death had viewed the land divinely assigned to Israel.
There Jeremiah found a spacious place, in which he concealed these
sacred utensils. Some of his companions had gone with him to note the
way to the cave, but yet they could not find it. When Jeremiah heard of
their purpose, he censured them, for it was the wish of God that the
place of hiding should remain a secret until the redemption, and then
God Himself will make the hidden things visible.

Even the Temple vessels not concealed by Jeremiah were prevented from
falling into the hands of the enemy; the gates of the Temple sank into
the earth, and other parts and utensils were hidden in a tower at Bagdad
by the Levite Shimur and his friends. Among these utensils was the
seven-branched candlestick of pure gold, every branch set with
twenty-six pearls, and beside the pearls two hundred stones of
inestimable worth. Furthermore, the tower at Bagdad was the hiding-place
for seventy-seven golden tables, and for the gold with which the walls
of the Temple had been clothed within and without. The tables had been
taken from Paradise by Solomon, and in brilliance they outshone the sun
and the moon, while the gold from the walls excelled in amount and worth
all the gold that had existed from the creation of the world until the
destruction of the Temple. The jewels, pearls, gold, and silver, and
precious gems, which David and Solomon had intended for the Temple were
discovered by the scribe Hilkiah, and he delivered them to the angel
Shamshiel, who in turn deposited the treasure in Borsippa. The sacred
musical instruments were taken charge of and hidden by Baruch and
Zedekiah until the advent of the Messiah, who will reveal all treasures.
In his time a stream will break forth from under the place of the Holy
of Holies, and flow through the lands to the Euphrates, and, as it
flows, it will uncover all the treasures buried in the earth.

### BARUCH

At the time of the destruction of the Temple, one of the prominent
figures was Baruch, the faithful attendant of Jeremiah. God commanded
him to leave the city one day before the enemy was to enter it, in order
that his presence might not render it impregnable. On the following day,
he and all other pious men having abandoned Jerusalem, he saw from a
distance how the angels descended, set fire to the city walls, and
concealed the sacred vessels of the Temple. At first his mourning over
the misfortunes of Jerusalem and the people knew no bounds. But he was
in a measure consoled at the end of a seven days' fast, when God made
known to him that the day of reckoning would come for the heathen, too.
Other Divine visions were vouchsafed him. The whole future of mankind
was unrolled before his eyes, especially the history of Israel, and he
learned that the coming of the Messiah would put an end to all sorrow
and misery, and usher in the reign of peace and joy among men. As for
him, he would be removed from the earth, he was told, but not through
death, and only in order to be kept safe against the coming of the end
of all time.

Thus consoled, Baruch addressed an admonition to the people left in
Palestine, and wrote two letters of the same tenor to the exiles, one to
the nine tribes and a half, the other to the two tribes and a half. The
letter to the nine tribes and a half of the captivity was carried to
them by an eagle.

Five years after the great catastrophe, he composed a book in Babylon,
which contained penitential prayers and hymns of consolation, exhorting
Israel and urging the people to return to God and His law. This book
Baruch read to King Jeconiah and the whole people on a day of prayer and
penitence. On the same occasion a collection was taken up among the
people, and the funds thus secured, together with the silver Temple
vessels made by order of Zedekiah after Jeconiah had been carried away
captive, were sent to Jerusalem, with the request that the high priest
Joakim and the people should apply the money to the sacrificial service
and to prayers for the life of King Nebuchadnezzar and his son
Belshazzar. Thus they might ensure peace and happiness under Babylonian
rule. Above all, they were to supplicate God to turn away His wrath from
His people.

Baruch sent his book also to the residents of Jerusalem, and they read
it in the Temple on distinguished days, and recited the prayers it
contains.

Baruch is one of the few mortals who have been privileged to visit
Paradise and know its secrets. An angel of the Lord appeared to him
while he was lamenting over the destruction of Jerusalem and took him to
the seven heavens, to the place of judgment where the doom of the
godless is pronounced, and to the abodes of the blessed.

He was still among the living at the time in which Cyrus permitted the
Jews to return to Palestine, but on account of his advanced age he could
not avail himself of the permission. So long as he was alive, his
disciple Ezra remained with him in Babylonia, for "the study of the law
is more important than the building of the Temple." It was only after
the death of Baruch that he decided to gather together the exiles who
desired to return to the Holy Land and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem.

### THE TOMBS OF BARUCH AND EZEKIEL

The piety of Baruch and the great favor he enjoyed with God were made
known to later generations many years after his death, through the
marvellous occurrences connected with his tomb. Once a Babylonian prince
commanded a Jew, Rabbi Solomon by name, to show him the grave of
Ezekiel, concerning which he had heard many remarkable tales. The Jew
advised the prince first to enter the tomb of Baruch, which adjoined
that of Ezekiel. Having succeeded in this, he might attempt the same
with the tomb of Ezekiel, the teacher of Baruch. In the presence of his
grandees and his people the prince tried to open the grave of Baruch,
but his efforts were fruitless. Whosoever touched it, was at once
stricken dead. An old Arab advised the prince to call upon the Jews to
gain entrance for him, seeing that Baruch had been a Jew, and his books
were still being studied by Jews. The Jews prepared themselves by fasts,
prayers, penitence, and almsgiving, and they succeeded in opening the
grave without a mishap. Baruch was found lying on marble bier, and the
appearance of the corpse was as though he had only then passed away. The
prince ordered the bier to be brought to the city, and the body to be
entombed there. He thought it was not seemly that Ezekiel and Baruch
should rest in the same grave. But the bearers found it impossible to
remove the bier more than two thousands ells from the original grave;
not even with the help of numerous draught-animals could it be urged a
single step further. Following the advice of Rabbi Solomon, the prince
resolved to enter the bier on the spot they had reached and also to
erect an academy there. These miraculous happenings induced the prince
to go to Mecca. There he became convinced of the falseness of
Mohammedanism, of which he had hitherto been an adherent, and he
converted to Judaism, he and his whole court.

Near the grave of Baruch there grows a species of grass whose leaves are
covered with gold dust. As the sheen of the gold is not readily
noticeable by day, the people seek out the place at night, mark the very
spot on which the grass grows, and return by day and gather it.

Not less famous is the tomb of Ezekiel, at a distance of two thousand
ells from Baruch's. It is overarched by a beautiful mausoleum erected by
King Jeconiah after Evil-merodach had released him from captivity. The
mausoleum existed down to the middle ages, and it bore on its walls the
names of the thirty-five thousand Jews who assisted Jeconiah in erecting
the monument. It was the scene of many miracles. When great crowds of
people journeyed thither to pay reverence to the memory of the prophet,
the little low gate in the wall surrounding the grave enlarged in width
and height to admit all who desired to enter. Once a prince vowed to
give a colt to the grave of the prophet, if but his mare which had been
sterile would bear one. When his wish was fulfilled, however, he did not
keep his promise. But the filly ran a distance equal to a four days'
journey to the tomb, and his owner could not recover it until he
deposited his value in silver upon the grace. When people went on long
journeys, they were in the habit of carrying their treasures to the
grave of the prophet, and beseeching him to let none but the rightful
heirs remove them thence. The prophet always granted their petition.
Once when an attempt was made to take some books from the grave of
Ezekiel, the ravager suddenly became sick and blind. For a time a pillar
of fire, visible at a great distance, rose above the grave of the
prophet, but it disappeared in consequence of the unseemly conduct of
the pilgrims who resorted thither.

Not far from the grave of Ezekiel was the grave of Barozak, who once
appeared to a rich Jew in a dream. He spoke: "I am Barozak, one of the
princes who were led into captivity with Jeremiah. I am one of the just.
If thou wilt erect a handsome mausoleum for me, thou wilt be blessed
with progeny." The Jew did as he had been bidden, and he who had been
childless, shortly after became a father.

### DANIEL

The most distinguished member of the Babylonian Diaspora was Daniel.
Though not a prophet, he was surpassed by none in wisdom, piety, and
good deeds. His firm adherence to Judaism he displayed from his early
youth, when, a page at the royal court, he refused to partake of the
bread, wine, and oil of the heathen, even though the enjoyment of them
was not prohibited by the law. In general, his prominent position at the
court was maintained at the cost of many a hardship, for he and his
companions, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, were envied their
distinctions by numerous enemies, who sought to compass their ruin.

Once they were accused before King Nebuchadnezzar of leading an unchaste
life. The king resolved to order their execution. But Daniel and his
friends mutilated certain parts of their bodies, and so demonstrated how
unfounded were the charges against them.

As a youth Daniel gave evidence of his wisdom, when he convicted two old
sinners of having testified falsely against Susanna, as beautiful as she
was good. Misled by the perjured witnesses, the court had condemned
Susanna to death. Then Daniel, impelled by a higher power, appeared
among the people, proclaimed that wrong had been done, and demanded that
the case be re-opened. And so it was. Daniel himself cross-questioned
the witnesses one after the other. The same questions were addressed to
both, and as the replies did not agree with each other, the false
witnesses stood condemned, and they were made to suffer the penalty they
would have had the court inflict upon their victim.

Daniel's high position in the state dates from the time when he
interpreted Nebuchadnezzar's dream. The king said to the astrologers and
magicians: "I know my dream, but I do not want to tell you what it was,
else you will invent anything at all, and pretend it is the
interpretation of the dream. But if you tell me the dream, then I shall
have confidence in your interpretation of it."

After much talk between Nebuchadnezzar and his wise men, they confessed
that the king's wish might have been fulfilled, if but the Temple had
still existed. The high priest at Jerusalem might have revealed the
secret by consulting the Urim and Thummim. At this point the king became
wrathful against his wise men, who had advised him to destroy the
Temple, though they must have known how useful it might become to the
king and the state. He ordered them all to execution. Their life was
saved by Daniel, who recited the king's dream, and gave its
interpretation. The king was so filled with admiration of Daniel's
wisdom that he paid him Divine honors. Daniel, however, refused such
extravagant treatment he did not desire to be the object of idolatrous
veneration. He left Nebuchadnezzar in order to escape the marks of honor
thrust upon him, and repaired to Tiberias, where he build a canal.
Besides, he was charged by the king with commissions, to bring fodder
for cattle to Babylonia and also swine from Alexandria.

### THE THREE MEN IN THE FURNACE

During Daniel's absence Nebuchadnezzar set up an idol, and its worship
was exacted from all his subject under penalty of death by fire. The
image could not stand on account of the disproportion between its height
and its thickness. The whole of the gold and silver captured by the
Babylonians in Jerusalem was needed to give it steadiness.

All the nations owning the rule of Nebuchadnezzar, including even
Israel, obeyed the royal command to worship the image. Only the three
pious companions of Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, resisted the
order. In vain Nebuchadnezzar urged upon them, as an argument in favor
if idolatry, that the Jews had been so devoted to heathen practices
before the destruction of Jerusalem that they had gone to Babylonia for
the purpose of imitating the idols there and bringing the copies they
made to Jerusalem. The three saints would not hearken to these
seductions of the king, nor when he referred them to such authorities as
Moses and Jeremiah, in order to prove to them that they were under
obligation to do the royal bidding. They said to him: "Thou art our king
in all that concerns service, taxes, poll-money, and tribute, but with
respect to thy present command thou art only Nebuchadnezzar. Therein
thou and the dog are alike unto us. Bark like a dog, inflate thyself
like a water-bottle, and chirp like a cricket."

Now Nebuchadnezzar's wrath transcended all bound, and he ordered the
three to be cast into a red hot furnace, so hot that the flames of its
fire darted to the height of forty-nine ells beyond the oven, and
consumed the heathen standing about it. No less than four nations were
thus exterminated. While the three saints were being thrust into the
furnace, they addressed a fervent prayer to God, supplicating His grace
toward them, and entreating Him to put their adversaries to shame. The
angels desired to descend and rescue the three men in the furnace. But
God forbade it: "Did the three men act thus for your sakes? Nay, they
did it for Me; and I will save them with Mine own hands." God also
rejected the good offices of Yurkami, the angel of hail who offered to
extinguish the fire in the furnace. The angel Gabriel justly pointed out
that such a miracle would not be sufficiently striking to arrest
attention. His own proposition was accepted. He, the angel of fire, was
deputed to snatch the three men from the red hot furnace. He executed
his mission by cooling off the fire inside of the oven, while on the
outside the heat continued to increase to such a degree that the heathen
standing around the furnace were consumed. The three youths thereupon
raised their voices together in a hymn of praise to God, thanking Him
for His miraculous help. The Chaldeans observed the three men pacing up
and down quietly in the furnace, followed by a fourth the angel Gabriel
as by an attendant. Nebuchadnezzar, who hastened thither to see the
wonder, was stunned with fright, for he recognized Gabriel to be the
angel who in the guise of a column of fire had blasted the army of
Sennacherib. Six other miracles happened, all of them driving terror to
the heart of the king: the fiery furnace which had been sunk in the
ground raised itself into the air; it was broken; the bottom dropped
out; the image erected by Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate; four nations
were wasted by fire; and Ezekiel revived the dead in the valley of Dura.

Of the last, Nebuchadnezzar was apprised in a peculiar way. He had a
drinking vessel made of the bones of a slain Jew. When he was about to
use it, life began to stir in the bones, and a blow was planted in the
king's face, while a voice announced: "A friend of this man is at this
moment reviving the dead!" Nebuchadnezzar now offered praise to God for
the miracles performed, and if an angel had not quickly struck him a
blow on his mouth, and forced him into silence, his psalms of praise
would have excelled the Psalter of David.

The deliverance of the three pious young men was a brilliant vindication
of their ways, but at the same time it caused great mortification to the
masses of the Jewish people, who had complied with the order of
Nebuchadnezzar to worship his idol. Accordingly, when the three men left
the furnace which they did not do until Nebuchadnezzar invited them to
leave the heathen struck all the Jews they met in the face, deriding
them at the same time: "You who have so marvellous a God pay homage to
an idol!" The three men thereupon left Babylonia and went to Palestine,
where they joined their friend, the high priest Joshua.

Their readiness to sacrifice their lives for the honor of God had been
all the more admirable as they had been advised by the prophet Ezekiel
that no miracle would be done for their sakes. When the king's command
to bow down before the idol was published, and the three men were
appointed to act as the representatives of the people, Hananiah and his
companions resorted to Daniel for his advice. He referred them to the
prophet Ezekiel, who counselled flight, citing his teacher Isaiah as his
authority. The three men rejected his advice, and declared themselves
ready to suffer the death of martyrs. Ezekiel bade them tarry until he
inquired of God, whether a miracle would be done for them. The words of
God were: "I shall not manifest Myself as their savior. They caused My
house to be destroyed, My palace to be burnt, My children to be
dispersed among the heathen, and now they appeal for My help. As I live,
I will not be found of them."

Instead of discouraging the three men, this answer but infused new
spirit and resolution in them, and they declared with more decided
emphasis than before, that they were ready to meet death. God consoled
the weeping prophet by revealing to him, that He would save the three
saintly heroes. He had sought to restrain them from martyrdom only to
let their piety and steadfastness appear the brighter.

On account of their piety it became customary to swear by the Name of
Him who supports the world on three pillars, the pillars being the
saints Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Their deliverance from death by
fire worked a great effect upon the disposition of the heathen. They
were convinced of the uselessness of their idols, and with their own
hands they destroyed them.

### EZEKIEL REVIVES THE DEAD

Among the dead whom Ezekiel restored to life at the same time when the
three men were redeemed from the fiery furnace were different classes of
persons. Some were the Ephraimites that had perished in the attempt to
escape from Egypt before Moses led the whole nation out of the land of
bondage. Some were the godless among the Jews that had polluted the
Temple at Jerusalem with heathen rites, and those still more godless who
in life had not believed in the resurrection of the dead. Others of
those revived by Ezekiel were the youths among the Jews carried away
captive to Babylonia by Nebuchadnezzar whose beauty was so radiant that
it darkened the very splendor of the sun. The Babylonian women were
seized with a great passion for them, and at the solicitation of their
husbands, Nebuchadnezzar ordered a bloody massacre of the handsome
youths. But the Babylonian women were not yet cured of their unlawful
passion; the beauty of the young Hebrews haunted them until their
corpses lay crushed before them, their graceful bodies mutilated. These
were the youths recalled to life by the prophet Ezekiel. Lastly, he
revived some that had perished only a short time before. When Hananiah,
Mishael, and Azariah were saved from death, Nebuchadnezzar thus
addressed the other Jews, those who had yielded obedience to his command
concerning the worship of the idol: "You know that your God can help and
save, nevertheless you paid worship to an idol which is incapable of
doing anything. This proves that, as you have destroyed your own land by
your wicked deeds, so you are now trying to destroy my land with your
iniquity." Forthwith he commanded that they all be executed, sixty
thousand in number. Twenty years passed, and Ezekiel was vouchsafed the
vision in which God bade him repair to the Valley of Dura, where
Nebuchadnezzar had set up his idol, and had massacred the host of the
Jews. Here God showed him the dry bones of the slain with the question:
"Can I revive these bones?" Ezekiel's answer was evasive, and as a
punishment for his little faith, he had to end his days in Babylon, and
was not granted even burial in the soil of Palestine. God then dropped
the dew of heaven upon the dry bones, and "sinews were upon them, and
flesh came up, and skin covered them above." At the same time God sent
forth winds to the four corners of the earth, which unlocked the
treasure houses of souls, and brought its own soul to each body. All
came to life except one man, who, as God explained to the prophet, was
excluded from the resurrection because he was a usurer.

In spite of the marvellous miracle performed from them, the men thus
restored to life wept, because they feared they would have no share at
the end of time in the resurrection of the whole of Israel. But the
prophet assured them, in the name of God, that their portion in all that
had been promised Israel should in no wise be diminished.

### NEBUCHADNEZZAR A BEAST

Nebuchadnezzar, the ruler of the whole world, to whom even the wild
animals paid obedience, his pet was a lion with a snake coiled about its
neck, did not escape punishment for his sins. He was chastised as none
before him. He whom fear of God had at first held back from a war
against Jerusalem, and who had to be dragged forcibly, as he sat on his
horse, to the Holy of Holies by the archangel Michael, he later became
so arrogant that he thought himself a god, and cherished the plan of
enveloping himself in a cloud, so that he might live apart from men. A
heavenly voice resounded: "O thou wicked man, son of a wicked man, and
descendant of Nimrod the wicked, who incited the world to rebel against
God! Behold, the days of the years of a man are threescore years and
ten, or perhaps by reason of strength fourscore years. It takes five
hundred years to traverse the distance of the earth from the first
heaven, and as long a time to penetrate from the bottom to the top of
the first heaven, and not less are the distances from one of the seven
heavens to the next. How, then, canst thou speak of ascending like unto
the Most High 'above the heights of the clouds'?" For this transgression
of deeming himself more than a man, he was punished by being made to
live for some time as a beast among beasts, treated by them as though he
were one of them. For forty days he led this life. As far down as his
navel he had the appearance of an ox, and the lower part of his body
resembled that of a lion. Like an ox he ate grass, and like a lion he
attacked a curious crowd, but Daniel spent his time in prayer,
entreating that the seven years of this brutish life allotted to
Nebuchadnezzar might be reduced to seven months. His prayer was granted.
At the end of forty days reason returned to the king, the next forty
days he passed in weeping bitterly over his sins, and in the interval
that remained to complete the seven months he again lived the life of a
beast.

### HIRAM

Hiram, the king of Tyre, was a contemporary of Nebuchadnezzar, and in
many respects resembled him. He, too, esteemed himself a god, and sought
to make men believe in his divinity by the artificial heavens he
fashioned for himself. In the sea he erected four iron pillars, on which
he build up seven heavens, each five hundred ells larger than the one
below. The first was a plate of glass of five hundred square ells, and
the second a plate of iron of a thousand square ells. The third, of
lead, and separated from the second by canals, contained huge round
boulders, which produced the sound of thunder on the iron. The fourth
heaven was of brass, the fifth of copper, the sixth of silver, and the
seventh of gold, all separated from each other by canals. In the
seventh, thirty-five hundred ells in extent, he had diamonds and pearls,
which he manipulated so as to produce the effect of flashes and sheets
of lightening, while the stones below imitated the growling of the
thunder.

As Hiram was thus floating above the earth, in his vain imagination
deeming himself superior to the rest of men, he suddenly perceived the
prophet Ezekiel next to himself. He had been waved thither by a wind.
Frightened and amazed, Hiram asked the prophet how he had risen to his
heights. The answer was: "God brought me here, and He bade me ask thee
why thou art so proud, thou born of woman?" The king of Tyre replied
defiantly: "I am not one born of woman; I live forever, and as God
resides on the sea, so my abode is on the sea, and as He inhabits seven
heavens, so do I. See how many kings I have survived! Twenty-one of the
House of David, and as many of the Kingdom of the Ten Tribes, and no
less than fifty prophets and ten high priests have I buried." Thereupon
God said: "I will destroy My house, that henceforth Hiram may have no
reason for self-glorification, because all his pride comes only from the
circumstance that he furnished the cedar-trees for the building of the
Temple." The end of this proud king was that he was conquered by
Nebuchadnezzar, deprived of this throne, and made to suffer a cruel
death. Though the Babylonian king was the step-son of Hiram, he had no
mercy with him. Daily he cut off a bit of the flesh of his body, and
forced the Tyrian king to eat it, until the finally perished. Hiram's
palace was swallowed by the earth, and in the bowels of the earth it
will remain until it shall emerge in the future world as the habitation
of the pious.

### THE FALSE PROPHETS

Not only among the heathen, but also among the Jews there were very
sinful people in those days. The most notorious Jewish sinners were the
two false prophets Ahab and Zedekiah. Ahab came to the daughter of
Nebuchadnezzar and said: "Yield thyself to Zedekiah," telling her this
in the form of a Divine message. The same was done by Zedekiah, who only
varied the message by substituting the name of Ahab. The princess could
not accept such messages as Divine, and she told her father what had
occurred. Though Nebuchadnezzar was so addicted to immoral practices
that he was in the habit of making his captive kings drunk, and then
satisfying his unnatural lusts upon them, and a miracle had to interpose
to shield the pious of Judah against this disgrace, yet he well knew
that the God of the Jews hates immorality. He therefore questioned
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah about it, and they emphatically denied
the possibility that such a message could have come from God. The
prophets of lies refused to recall their statements, and Nebuchadnezzar
decided to subject them to the same fiery test as he had decreed for the
three pious companions of Daniel. To be fair toward them, the king
permitted them to choose a third fellow-sufferer, some pious man to
share their lot. Seeing no escape, Ahab and Zedekiah asked for Joshua,
later the high priest, as their companion in the furnace, in the hope
that his distinguished merits would suffice to save all three of them.
They were mistaken. Joshua emerged unhurt, only his garments were
seared, but the false prophets were consumed. Joshua explained the
singeing of his garments by the fact that he was directly exposed to the
full fury of the flames. But the truth was that he had to expiate the
sins of his sons, who had contracted marriages unworthy of their dignity
and descent. Therefore their father escaped death only after the fire
had burnt his garments.

### DANIEL'S PIETY

No greater contrast to Hiram and the false prophets Ahab and Zedekiah
can be imagined than is presented by the character of the pious Daniel.
When Nebuchadnezzar offered him Divine honors, he refused what Hiram
sought to obtain by every means in his power. The Babylonian king felt
so ardent an admiration for Daniel that he sent him from the country
when the time arrived to worship the idol he had erected in Dura, for he
knew very well that Daniel would prefer death in the flames to disregard
of the commands of God, and he could not well have cast the man into the
fire to whom he had paid Divine homage. Moreover, it was the wish of God
that Daniel should not pass through the fiery ordeal at the same time as
his three friends, in order that their deliverance might not be ascribed
to him.

In spite of all this, Nebuchadnezzar endeavored to persuade Daniel by
gentle means to worship an idol. He had the golden diadem of the high
priest inserted in the mouth of an idol, and by reason of the wondrous
power that resides in the Holy Name inscribed on the diadem, the idol
gained the ability to speak, and it said the words: "I am thy God." Thus
were many seduced to worship the image. But Daniel could not be misled
so easily. He secured permission from the king to kiss the idol. Laying
his mouth upon the idol's, he adjured the diadem in the following words:
"I am but flesh and blood, yet at the same time a messenger of God. I
therefore admonish thee, take heed that the Name of the Holy One,
blessed be He, may not be desecrated, and I order thee to follow me." So
it happened. When the heathen came with music and song to give honor to
the idol, it emitted no sound, but a storm broke loose and overturned
it.

On still another occasion Nebuchadnezzar tried to persuade Daniel to
worship an idol, this time a dragon that devoured all who approached it,
and therefore was adored as a god by the Babylonians. Daniel had straw
mixed with nails fed to him, and the dragon ate and perished almost
immediately.

All this did not prevent Daniel from keeping the welfare of the king in
mind continually. Hence it was that when Nebuchadnezzar was engaged in
setting his house in order, he desired to mention 'Daniel in his will as
one of his heirs. But the Jew refused with the words: "Far be it from me
to leave the inheritance of my fathers for that of the uncircumcised."

Nebuchadnezzar died after having reigned forty years, as long as King
David. The death of the tyrant brought hope and joy to many a heart, for
his severity had been such that during his lifetime none dared laugh,
and when he descended to Sheol, its inhabitants trembled, fearing he had
come to reign over them, too. However, a heavenly voice called to him:
"Go down, and be thou laid down with the uncircumcised."

The interment of this great king was anything but what one might have
expected, and for this reason: During the seven years spent by
Nebuchadnezzar among the beast, his son Evil-merodach ruled in his
stead. Nebuchadnezzar reappeared after his period of penance, and
incarcerated his son for life. When the death of Nebuchadnezzar actually
did occur, Evil-merodach refused to accept the homage the nobles brought
him as the new king, because he feared that his father was not dead, but
had only disappeared as once before, and would return again. To convince
him of the groundlessness of his apprehension, the corpse of
Nebuchadnezzar, badly mutilated by his enemies, was dragged through the
streets.

Shortly afterward occurred the death of Zedekiah, the dethroned king of
Judah. His burial took place amid great demonstrations of sympathy and
mourning. The elegy over him ran thus: "Alas that King Zedekiah had to
die, he who quaffed the lees which all the generations before him
accumulated."

Zedekiah reached a good old age, for though it was in his reign that the
destruction of Jerusalem took place, yet it was the guilt of the nation,
not of the king, that had brought about the catastrophe.
