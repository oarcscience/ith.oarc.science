JOB--JOB AND THE PATRIARCHS--JOB'S WEALTH AND BENEFACTIONS--SATAN AND
JOB--JOB'S SUFFERING--THE FOUR FRIENDS--JOB RESTORED

### JOB--JOB AND THE PATRIARCHS

Job, the most pious Gentile that ever lived, one of the few to bear the
title of honor "the servant of God," was of double kin to Jacob. He was
a grandson of Jacob's brother Esau, and at the same time the son-in-law
of Jacob himself, for he had married Dinah as his second wife. He was
entirely worthy of being a member of the Patriarch's family, for he was
perfectly upright, one that feared God, and eschewed evil. Had he not
wavered in his resignation to the Divine will during the great trial to
which he was subjected, and murmured against God, the distinction would
have been conferred upon him of having his name joined to the Name of
God in prayer, and men would have called upon the God of Job as they now
call upon the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But he was not found
steadfast like the three Fathers, and he forfeited the honor God had
intended for him.

The Lord remonstrated with him for his lack of patience, saying: "Why
didst thou murmur when suffering came upon thee? Dost thou think thyself
of greater worth than Adam, the creation of Mine own hands, upon whom
together with his descendants I decreed death on account of a single
transgression? And yet Adam murmured not. Thou art surely not more
worthy than Abraham, whom I tempted with many trials, and when he asked,
'Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit the land?' and I replied,
'Know of a surety that thy seed will be a stranger in a land that is not
theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred
years,' he yet murmured not. Thou dost not esteem thyself more worthy
than Moses, dost thou? Him I would not grant the favor of entering the
promised land, because he spake the words, 'Hear now, ye rebels; shall
we bring you forth water out of this rock?' And yet he murmured not. Art
thou more worthy than Aaron, unto whom I showed greater honor than unto
any created being, for I sent the angels themselves out of the Holy of
Holies when he entered the place? Yet when his two sons died, he
murmured not."

The contrast between Job and the Patriarchs appears from words spoken by
him and words spoken by Abraham. Addressing God, Abraham said, "That be
far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the
wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked," and Job
exclaimed against God, "It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth
the perfect and the wicked." They both received their due recompense,
Abraham was rewarded and Job was punished.

Convinced that his suffering was undeserved and unjust, Job had the
audacity to say to God: "O Lord of the world, Thou didst create the ox
with cloven feet and the ass with unparted hoof, Thou hast created
Paradise and hell, Thou createst the righteous and also the wicked.
There is none to hinder, Thou canst do as seemeth good in Thy sight."
The friends of Job replied: "It is true, God hath created the evil
inclination, but He hath also given man the Torah as a remedy against
it. Therefore the wicked cannot roll their guilt from off their
shoulders and put it upon God."

The reason Job did not shrink from such extravagant utterances was
because he denied the resurrection of the dead. He judged of the
prosperity of the wicked and the woes of the pious only by their earthly
fortunes. Proceeding from this false premise, he held it to be possible
that the punishment falling to his share was not at all intended for
him. God had slipped into an error, He imposed the suffering upon him
that had been appointed unto a sinner. But God spake to him, saying:
"Many hairs have I created upon the head of man, yet each hair hath its
own sac, for were two hairs to draw their nourishment from the same sac,
man would lose the sight of his eyes. It hath never happened that a sac
hath been misplaced. Should I, then, have mistaken Job for another? I
let many drops of rain descend from the heavens, and for each drop there
is a mould in the clouds, for were two drops to issue from the same
mould, the ground would be made so miry that it could not bring forth
any growth. It hath never happened that a mould hath been misplaced.
Should I, then, have mistaken Job for another? Many thunderbolts I hurl
from the skies, but each one comes from its own path, for were two to
proceed from the same path, they would destroy the whole world. It hath
never happened that a path hath been misplaced. Should I, then, have
mistaken Job for another? The gazelle gives birth to her young on the
topmost point of a rock, and it would fall into the abyss and be crushed
to death, if I did not send an eagle thither to catch it up and carry it
to its mother. Were the eagle to appear a minute earlier or later than
the appointed time, the little gazelle would perish. It hath never
happened that the proper minute of time was missed. Should I, then, have
mistaken Job for another? The hind has a contracted womb, and would not
be able to bring forth her young, if I did not send a dragon to her at
the right second, to nibble at her womb and soften it, for then she can
bear. Were the dragon to come a second before or after the right time,
the hind would perish. It hath never happened that I missed the right
second. Should I, then, have mistaken Job for another?"

Notwithstanding Job's unpardonable words, God was displeased with his
friends for passing harsh judgment upon him. "A man may not be held
responsible for what he does in his anguish," and Job's agony was great,
indeed.

### JOB'S WEALTH AND BENEFACTIONS

Job was asked once what he considered the severest affliction that could
strike him, and he replied, "My enemies' joy in my misfortune, and when
God demanded to know of him, after the accusations made by Satan, what
he preferred, poverty or physical suffering, he chose pain, saying, "O
Lord of the whole world, chastise my body with suffering of all kinds,
only preserve me from poverty." Poverty seemed the greater scourge,
because before his trials he had occupied a brilliant position on
account of his vast wealth. God graciously granted him this foretaste of
the Messianic time. The harvest followed close upon the ploughing of his
field; no sooner were the seeds strewn in the furrows, than they
sprouted and grew and ripened produce. He was equally successful with
his cattle. His sheep killed wolves, but were themselves never harmed by
wild beasts. Of sheep he had no less than one hundred and thirty
thousand, and he required eight hundred dogs to keep guard over them,
not to mention the two hundred dogs needed to secure the safety of his
house. Besides, his herds consisted of three hundred and forty thousand
asses and thirty-five hundred pairs of oxen. All these possessions were
not used for self-indulgent pleasures, but for the good of the poor and
the needy, whom he clothed, and fed, and provided with all things
necessary. To do all this, he even had to employ ships that carried
supplies to all the cities and the dwelling-places of the destitute. His
house was furnished with doors on all its four sides, that the poor and
the wayfarer might enter, no matter from what direction they approached.
At all times there were thirty tables laden with viands ready in his
house, and twelve besides for widows only, so that all who came found
what they desired. Job's consideration for the poor was so delicate that
he kept servants to wait upon them constantly. His guests, enraptured by
his charitableness, frequently offered themselves as attendants to
minister to the poor in his house, but Job always insisted upon paying
them for their services. If he was asked for a loan of money, to be used
for business purposes, and the borrower promised to give a part of his
profits to the poor, he would demand no security beyond a mere
signature. And if it happened that by some mischance or other the debtor
was not able to discharge his obligation, Job would return the note to
him, or tear it into bits in his presence.

He did not rest satisfied at supplying the material needs of those who
applied to him. He strove also to convey the knowledge of God to them.
After a meal he was in the habit of having music played upon
instruments, and then he would invite those present to join him in songs
of praise to God. On such occasions he did not consider himself above
playing the cithern while the musicians rested.

Most particularly Job concerned himself about the weal and woe of widows
and orphans. He was wont to pay visits to the sick, both rich and poor,
and when it was necessary, he would bring a physician along with him. If
the case turned out to be hopeless, he would sustain the stricken family
with advice and consolation. When the wife of the incurably sick man
began to grieve and weep, he would encourage her with such words as
these: "Trust always in the grace and lovingkindness of God. He hath not
abandoned thee until now, and He will not forsake thee henceforth. Thy
husband will be restored to health, and will be able to provide for his
family as heretofore. But if--which may God forefend--thy husband should
die, I call Heaven to witness that I shall provide sustenance for thee
and thy children." Having spoken thus, he would send for a notary, and
have him draw up a document, which he signed in the presence of
witnesses, binding himself to care for the family, should it be bereaved
of its head. Thus he earned for himself the blessing of the sick man and
the gratitude of the sorrowing wife.

Sometimes, in case of necessity, Job could be severe, too, especially
when it was a question of helping a poor man obtain his due. If one of
the parties to a suit cited before his tribunal was known to be a man of
violence, he would surround himself with his army and inspire him with
fear, so that the culprit could not but show himself amenable to his
decision.

He endeavored to inculcate his benevolent ways upon his children, by
accustoming them to wait upon the poor. On the morrow after a feast he
would sacrifice bountifully to God, and together with the pieces upon
the altar his offerings would be divided among the needy. He would say:
"Take and help yourselves, and pray for my children. It may be that they
have sinned, and renounced God, saying in the presumption of their
hearts: 'We are the children of this rich man. All these things are our
possessions. Why should we be servants to the poor?'"

### SATAN AND JOB

The happy, God-pleasing life led by Job for many years excited the
hatred of Satan, who had an old grudge against him. Near Job's house
there was an idol worshipped by the people. Suddenly doubts assailed the
heart of Job, and he asked himself: "Is this idol really the creator of
heaven and earth? How can I find out the truth about it?" In the
following night he perceived a voice calling: "Jobab! Jobab! Arise, and
I will tell thee who he is whom thou desirest to know. This one to whom
the people offer sacrifices is not God, he is the handiwork of the
tempter, wherewith he deceives men." When he heard the voice, Job threw
himself on the ground, and said: "O Lord, if this idol is the handiwork
of the tempter, then grant that I may destroy it. None can hinder me,
for I am the king of this land."

Job, or, as he is sometimes called, Jobab, was, indeed, king of Edom,
the land wherein wicked plans are concocted against God, wherefore it is
called also Uz, "counsel."

The voice continued to speak. It made itself known as that of an
archangel of God, and revealed to Job that he would bring down the
enmity of Satan upon himself by the destruction of the idol, and much
suffering with it. However, if he remained steadfast under them, God
would change his troubles into joys, his name would become celebrated
throughout the generations of mankind, and he would have a share in the
resurrection to eternal life. Job replied to the voice: "Out of love of
God I am ready to endure all things unto the day of my death. I will
shrink back from naught." Now Job arose, and accompanied by fifty men he
repaired to the idol, and destroyed it.

Knowing that Satan would try to approach him, he ordered his guard not
to give access to any one, and then he withdrew to his chamber. He had
guessed aright. Satan appeared at once, in the guise of a beggar, and
demanded speech with Job. The guard executed his orders, and forbade his
entering. Then the mendicant asked him to intercede for him with Job for
a piece of bread. Job knew it was Satan, and he sent word to him as
follows, "Do not expect to eat of my bread, for it is prohibited unto
thee," at the same time putting a piece of burnt bread into the hand of
the guard for Satan. The servant was ashamed to give a beggar burnt
bread, and he substituted a good piece for it. Satan, however, knowing
that the servant had not executed his master's errand, told him so to
his face, and he fetched the burnt bread and handed it to him, repeating
the words of Job. Thereupon Satan returned this answer, "As the bread is
burnt, so I will disfigure thy body." Job replied: "Do as thou desirest,
and execute thy plan. As for me, I am ready to suffer whatever thou
bringest down upon me."

Now Satan betook himself to God, and prayed Him to put Job into his
power, saying: "I went to and fro in the earth, and walked up and down
in it, and I saw no man as pious as Abraham. Thou didst promise him the
whole land of Palestine, and yet he did not take it in ill part that he
had not so much as a burial-place for Sarah. As for Job, it is true, I
found none that loveth Thee as he does, but if Thou wilt put him into my
hand, I shall succeed in turning his heart away from Thee." But God
spake, "Satan, Satan, what hast thou a mind to do with my servant Job,
like whom there is none in the earth?" Satan persisted in his request
touching Job, and God granted it, He gave him full power over Job's
possessions.

This day of Job's accusation was the New Year's Day, whereon the good
and the evil deeds of man are brought before God.

### JOB'S SUFFERING

Equipped with unlimited power, Satan endeavored to deprive Job of all he
owned. He burnt part of his cattle, and the other part was carried off
by enemies. What pained Job more than this was that recipients of his
bounty turned against him, and took of his belongings.

Among the adversaries that assailed him was Lilith, the queen of Sheba.
She lived at a great distance from his residence, it took her and her
army three years to travel from her home to his. She fell upon his oxen
and his asses, and took possession of them, after slaying the men to
whose care Job had entrusted them. One man escaped alone. Wounded and
bruised, he had only enough life in him to tell Job the tale of his
losses, and then he fell down dead. The sheep, which had been left
unmolested by the queen of Sheba, were taken away by the Chaldeans.
Job's first intention was to go to war against these marauders, but when
he was told that some of his property had been consumed by fire from
heaven, he desisted, and said, "If the heavens turn against me, I can do
nothing."

Dissatisfied with the result, Satan disguised himself as the king of
Persia, besieged the city of Job's residence, took it, and spoke to the
inhabitants, saying: "This man Job hath appropriated all the goods in
the world, leaving naught for others, and he hath also torn down the
temple of our god, and now I will pay him back for his wicked deeds.
Come with me and let us pillage his house." At first the people refused
to hearken to the words of Satan. They feared that the sons and
daughters of Job might rise up against them later, and avenge their
father's wrongs. But after Satan had pulled down the house wherein the
children of Job were assembled, and they lay dead in the ruins, the
people did as he bade them, and sacked the house of Job.

Seeing that neither the loss of all he had nor the death of his children
could change his pious heart, Satan appeared before God a second time,
and requested that Job himself, his very person, be put into his hand.
God granted Satan's plea, but he limited his power to Job's body, his
soul he could not touch. In a sense Satan was worse off than Job. He was
in the position of the slave that has been ordered by his master to
break the pitcher and not spill the wine.

Satan now caused a terrific storm to burst over the house of Job. He was
cast from his throne by the reverberations, and he lay upon the floor
for three hours. Then Satan smote his body with leprosy from the sole of
his foot unto his crown. This plague forced Job to leave the city, and
sit down outside upon an ash-heap, for his lower limbs were covered with
oozing boils, and the issue flowed out upon the ashes. The upper part of
his body was encrusted with dry boils, and to ease the itching they
caused him, he used his nails, until they dropped off together with his
fingertips, and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal. His
body swarmed with vermin, but if one of the little creatures attempted
to crawl away from him, he forced it back, saying, "Remain on the place
whither thou wast sent, until God assigns another unto thee." His wife,
fearful that he would not bear his horrible suffering with
steadfastness, advised him to pray to God for death, that he might be
sure of going hence an upright man. But he rejected her counsel, saying,
"If in the days of good fortune, which usually tempts men to deny God, I
stood firm, and did not rebel against Him, surely I shall be able to
remain steadfast under misfortune, which compels men to be obedient to
God." And Job stuck to his resolve in spite of all suffering, while his
wife was not strong enough to bear her fate with resignation to the will
of God.

Her lot was bitter, indeed, for she had had to take service as a
water-carrier with a common churl, and when her master learnt that she
shared her bread with Job, he dismissed her. To keep her husband from
starving, she cut off her hair, and purchased bread with it. It was all
she had to pay the price charged by the bread merchant, none other than
Satan himself, who wanted to put her to the test. He said to her, "Hadst
thou not deserved this great misery of thine, it had not come upon
thee." This speech was more than the poor woman could bear. Then it was
that she came to her husband, and amid tears and groans urged him to
renounce God and die. Job, however, was not perturbed by her words,
because he divined at once that Satan stood behind his wife, and seduced
her to speak thus. Turning to the tempter, he said: "Why dost thou not
meet me frankly? Give up thy underhand ways, thou wretch." Thereupon
Satan appeared before Job, admitted that he had been vanquished, and
went away abashed.

### THE FOUR FRIENDS

The friends of Job lived in different places, at intervals of three
hundred miles one from the other. Nevertheless they all were informed of
their friend's misfortune at the same time, in this way: Each one had
the pictures of the others set in his crown, and as soon as any one of
them met with reverses, it showed itself in his picture. Thus the
friends of Job learnt simultaneously of his misfortune, and they
hastened to his assistance.

The four friends were related to one another, and each one was related
to Job. Eliphaz, king of Teman, was a son of Esau; Bildad, Zophar, and
Elihu were cousins, their fathers, Shuah, Naamat, and Barachel, were the
sons of Buz, who was a brother of Job and a nephew of Abraham.

When the four friends arrived in the city in which Job lived, the
inhabitants took them outside the gates, and pointing to a figure
reclining upon an ash-heap at some distance off, they said, "Yonder is
Job." At first the friends would not give them credence, and they
decided to look more closely at the man, to make sure of his identity.
But the foul smell emanating from Job was so strong that they could not
come near to him. They ordered their armies to scatter perfumes and
aromatic substances all around. Only after this had been done for hours,
they could approach the outcast close enough to recognize him.

Eliphaz was the first to address Job, "Art thou indeed Job, a king equal
in rank with ourselves?" And when Job said Aye, they broke out into
lamentations and bitter tears, and all together they sang an elegy, the
armies of the three kings, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, joining in the
choir. Again Eliphaz began to speak, and he bemoaned Job's sad fortune,
and depicted his friend's former glory, adding the refrain to each
sentence, "Whither hath departed the splendor of thy throne?"

After listening long to the wailing and lamenting of Eliphaz and his
companions, Job spake, saying: "Silence, and I will show you my throne
and the splendor of its glory. Kings will perish, rulers disappear,
their pride and lustre will pass like a shadow across a mirror, but my
kingdom will persist forever and ever, for glory and magnificence are in
the chariot of my Father."

These words aroused the wrath of Eliphaz, and he called upon his
associates to abandon Job to his fate and go their way. But Bildad
appeased his anger, reminding him that some allowance ought to be made
for one so sorely tried as Job. Bildad put a number of questions to the
sufferer in order to establish his sanity. He wanted to elicit from Job
how it came about that God, upon whom he continued to set his hopes,
could inflict such dire suffering. Not even a king of flesh and blood
would allow a guardsman of his that had served him loyally to come to
grief. Bildad desired to have information from Job also concerning the
movements of the heavenly bodies.

Job had but one answer to make to these questions: man cannot comprehend
Divine wisdom, whether it reveal itself in inanimate and brute nature or
in relation to human beings. "But," continued Job, "to prove to you that
I am in my right mind, listen to the question I shall put to you. Solid
food and liquids combine inside of man, and they separate again when
they leave his body. Who effects the separation?" And when Bildad
conceded that he could not answer the question, Job said, "If thou canst
not comprehend the changes in thy body, how canst thou hope to
comprehend the movements of the planets?"

Zophar, after Job had spoken thus to Bildad, was convinced that his
suffering had had no effect upon his mind, and he asked him whether he
would permit himself to be treated by the physicians of the three kings,
his friends. But Job rejected the offer, saying, "My healing and my
restoration come from God, the Creator of all physicians."

While the three kings were conversing thus with Job, his wife Zitidos
made her appearance clad in rags, and she threw herself at the feet of
her husband's friends, and amid tears she spoke, saying: "O Eliphaz, and
ye other friends of Job, remember what I was in other days, and how I am
now changed, coming before you in rags and tatters." The sight of the
unhappy woman touched them so deeply that they could only weep, and not
a word could they force out of their mouths. Eliphaz, however, took his
royal mantle of purple, and laid it about the shoulders of the poor
woman. Zitidos asked only one favor, that the three kings should order
their soldiers to clear away the ruins of the building under which her
children lay entombed, that she might give their remains decent burial.
The command was issued to the soldiers accordingly, but Job said, "Do
not put yourselves to trouble for naught. My children will not be found,
for they are safely bestowed with their Lord and Creator." Again his
friends were sure that Job was bereft of his senses. He arose, however,
prayed to God, and at the end of his devotions, he bade his friends look
eastward, and when they did his bidding, they beheld his children next
to the Ruler of heaven, with crowns of glory upon their heads. Zitidos
prostrated herself, and said, "Now I know that my memorial resides with
the Lord." And she returned to the house of her master, whence she had
absented herself for some time against his will. He had forbidden her to
leave it, because he had feared that the three kings would take her with
them.

In the evening she lay down to sleep next to the manger for the cattle,
but she never rose again, she died there of exhaustion. The people of
the city made a great mourning for her, and the elegy composed in her
honor was set down in writing and recorded.

### JOB RESTORED

More and more the friends of Job came to the conclusion that he had
incurred Divine punishment on account of his sins, and as he asseverated
his innocence again and again, they prepared angrily to leave him to his
fate. Especially Elihu was animated by Satan to speak scurrilous words
against Job, upbraiding him for his unshakable confidence in God. Then
the Lord appeared to them, first unto Job, and revealed to him that
Elihu was in the wrong, and his words were inspired by Satan. Next he
appeared unto Eliphaz, and to him He spake thus: "Thou and thy friends
Bildad and Zophar have committed a sin, for ye did not speak the truth
concerning my servant Job. Rise up and let him bring a sin offering for
you. Only for his sake do I refrain from destroying you."

The sacrifice offered by Job in behalf of his friends was accepted
graciously by God, and Eliphaz broke out into a hymn of thanksgiving to
the Lord for having pardoned the transgression of himself and his two
friends. At the same time he announced the damnation of Elihu, the
instrument of Satan.

God appeared to Job once more, and gave him a girdle composed of three
ribands, and he bade him tie it around his waist. Hardly had he put it
on when all his pain disappeared, his very recollection of it vanished,
and, more than this, God made him to see all that ever was and all that
shall ever be.

After suffering sevenfold pain for seven years Job was restored to
strength. With his three friends he returned to the city, and the
inhabitants made a festival in his honor and unto the glory of God. All
his former friends joined him again, and he resumed his old occupation,
the care of the poor, for which he obtained the means from the people
around. He said to them, "Give me, each one of you, a sheep for the
clothing of the poor, and four silver or gold drachmas for their other
needs." The Lord blessed Job, and in a few days his wealth had increased
to double the substance he had owned before misfortune overtook him.
Zitidos having died during the years of his trials, he married a second
wife, Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and she bore him seven sons and
three daughters. He had never had more than one wife at a time, for he
was wont to say, "If it had been intended that Adam should have ten
wives, God would have given them to him. Only one wife was bestowed upon
him, whereby God indicated that he was to have but one, and therefore
one wife suffices for me, too."

When Job, after a long and happy life, felt his end approaching, he
gathered his ten children around him, and told them the tale of his
days. Having finished the narrative, he admonished them in these words:
"See, I am about to die, and you will stand in my place. Forsake not the
Lord, be generous toward the poor, treat the feeble with consideration,
and do not marry with the women of the Gentiles."

Thereupon he divided his possessions among his sons, and to his
daughters he gave what is more precious than all earthly goods, to each
of them one riband of the celestial girdle he had received from God. The
magic virtue of these ribands was such that no sooner did their
possessors tie them around their waists than they were transformed into
higher beings, and with seraphic voices they broke out into hymns after
the manner of the angels.

For three days Job lay upon his bed, sick though not suffering, for the
celestial girdle made him proof against pain. On the fourth day he saw
the angels descend to fetch his soul. He arose from his bed, handed a
cithern to his oldest daughter Jemimah, "Day," a censer to the second
one, Keziah, "Perfume," and a cymbal to the third, Amaltheas, "Horn,"
and bade them welcome the angels with the sound of music. They played
and sang and praised the Lord in the holy tongue. Then he appeared that
sits in the great chariot, kissed Job, and rode away bearing his soul
with him eastward. None saw them depart except the three daughters of
Job.

The grief of the people, especially the poor, the widows, and the
orphans, was exceeding great. For three days they left the corpse
unburied, because they could not entertain the thought of separating
themselves from it.

As the name of Job will remain imperishable unto all time, by reason of
the man's piety, so his three friends were recompensed by God for their
sympathy with him in his distress. Their names were preserved, the
punishment of hell was remitted unto them, and, best of all, God poured
out the holy spirit over them. But Satan, the cause of Job's anguish,
the Lord cast down from heaven, for he had been vanquished by Job, who
amid his agony had thanked and praised God for all He had done unto him.
