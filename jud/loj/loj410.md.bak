# IX. THE LATER KINGS OF JUDAH

### JOASH

When the prophet Jonah, doing the behest of his master Elisha, anointed
Jehu king over Israel, he poured the oil out of a pitcher, not out of a
horn, to indicate that the dynasty of Jehu would not occupy the throne
long. At first Jehu, though a somewhat foolish king, was at least pious,
but he abandoned his God-fearing ways from the moment he saw the
document bearing the signature of the prophet Ahijah of Shilo, which
bound the signers to pay implicit obedience to Jeroboam. The king took
this as evidence that the prophet had approved the worship of the golden
calves. So it came to pass that Jehu, the destroyer of Baal worship, did
nothing to oppose the idolatrous service established by Jeroboam at
Beth-el. The successors of Jehu were not better; on the contrary, they
were worse, and therefore in the fifth generation an end was put to the
dynasty of Jehu by the hand of the assassin.

The kings of Judah differed in no essential particular from their
colleagues in the north. Ahaziah, whom Jehu killed, was a shameless
sinner; he had the Name of God expurged from every passage in which it
occurred in the Holy Scriptures, and the names of idols inserted in its
place.

Upon the death of Ahaziah followed the reign of terror under the queen
Athaliah, when God exacted payment from the house of David for his
trespass in connection with the extermination of the priest at Nob. As
Abiathar had been the only male descendant of Abimelech to survive the
persecution of Saul, so the sole representative of the house of David to
remain after the sword of Athaliah had raged was Joash, the child kept
in hiding, in the Holy of Holies in the Temple, by the high priest
Jehoiada and his wife Jehosheba. Later Jehoiada vindicated the right of
Joash upon the throne, and installed him as king of Judah. The very
crown worn by the rulers of the house of David testified to the
legitimacy of the young prince, for it possessed the peculiarity of
fitting none but the rightful successors to David.

At the instigation of Jehoiada, King Joash undertook the restoration of
the Temple. The work was completed so expeditiously that one living at
the time the Temple was erected by Solomon was permitted to see the new
structure shortly before his death. This good fortune befell Jehoiada
himself, the son of Benaiah, commander-in-chief of the army under
Solomon. So long as Joash continued under the tutelage of Jehoiada, he
was a pious king. When Jehoiada departed this life, the courtiers came
to Joash and flattered him: "If thou wert not a god, thou hadst not been
able to abide for six years in the Holy of Holies, a spot which even the
high priest is permitted to enter but once a year." The king lent ear to
their blandishments, and permitted the people to pay him Divine homage.
But when the folly of the king went to the extreme of prompting him to
set up an idol in the Temple, Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, placed
himself at the entrance, and barring the way said: "Thou shalt not do it
so long as I live." High priest, prophet, and judge though Zechariah
was, and son-in-law of Joash to boot, the king still did not shrink from
having him killed for his presumptuous words, not was he deterred by the
fact that it happened on a Day of Atonement which fell on the Sabbath.
The innocent blood crimsoning the hall of the priests did not remain
unavenged. For two hundred and fifty-two years it did not leave off
seething and pulsating, until, finally, Nebuzaradan, captain of
Nebuchadnezzar's guard, ordered a great carnage among the Judeans, to
avenge the death of Zechariah.

Joash himself, the murderer of Zechariah, met with an evil end. He fell
into the hands of the Syrians, and they abused him in their barbarous,
immoral way. Before he could recover from the suffering inflicted upon
him, his servants slew him.

Amaziah, the son and successor of Joash, in many respects resembled his
father. At the beginning of his reign he was God-fearing, but when,
through the aid of God, he had gained a brilliant victory over the
Edomites, he knew no better way of manifesting his gratitude than to
establish in Jerusalem the cult of the idol worshipped by his conquered
enemies. To compass his chastisement, God inspired Amaziah with the idea
of provoking a war with Joash, the ruler of the northern kingdom.
Amaziah demanded that Joash should either recognize the suzerainty of
the southern realm voluntarily, or let the fate of battle decide the
question. At first Joash sought to turn Amaziah aside from his purpose
by a parable reminding him of the fate of Shechem, which the sons of
Jacob had visited upon him for having done violence to their sister
Dinah. Amaziah refused to be warned. He persisted in his challenge, and
a war ensued. The fortune of battle decided against Amaziah. He suffered
defeat, and later he was tortured to death by his own subjects.

### THREE GREAT PROPHETS

The reign of Uzziah, who for a little while occupied the throne during
his father Amaziah's lifetime, is notable particularly because it marks
the beginning of the activity of three of the prophets, Hosea, Amos, and
Isaiah. The oldest of the three was Hosea, the son of the prophet and
prince Beeri, the Beeri who later was carried away captive by
Tiglath-pileser, the king of Assyria. Of Beeri's prophecies we have but
two verses, preserved for us by Isaiah.

The peculiar marriage contracted by Hosea at the command of God Himself
was not without a good reason. When God spoke to the prophet about the
sins of Israel, expecting him to defend or excuse his people, Hosea said
severely: "O Lord of the world! Thine is the universe. In place of
Israel choose another as Thy peculiar people from among the nations of
the earth." To make the true relation between God and Israel known to
the prophet, he was commanded to take to wife a woman with a dubious
past. After she had borne him several children, God suddenly put the
question to him: "Why followest thou not the example of thy teacher
Moses, who denied himself the joys of family life after his call to
prophecy?" Hosea replied: "I can neither send my wife away nor divorce
her, for she has borne me children." "If, now," said God to him, "thou
who hast a wife of whose honesty thou art so uncertain that thou canst
not even be sure that her children are thine, and yet thou canst not
separate from her, how, then can I separate Myself from Israel, from My
children, the children of My elect, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob!" Hosea
entreated God to pardon him. But God said: "Better were it that thou
shouldst pray for the welfare of Israel, for thou art the cause that I
issued three fateful decrees against them." Hosea prayed as he was
bidden, and his prayer averted the impending threefold doom.

Hosea died at Babylon at a time in which a journey thence to Palestine
was beset with many perils. Desirous of having his earthly remains rest
in sacred ground, he requested before his death that his bier be loaded
upon a camel, and the animal permitted to make its way as it would.
Wherever it stopped, there his body was to be buried. As he commanded,
so it was done. Without a single mishap the camel arrived at Safed. In
the Jewish cemetery of the town it stood still, and there Hosea was
buried in the presence of a large concourse.

The prophetical activity of Amos commenced after Hosea's had closed, and
before Isaiah's began. Though he had an impediment in his speech, he
obeyed the call of God, and betook himself to Beth-el to proclaim to the
sinful inhabitants thereof the Divine message with which he had been
charged. The denunciation of the priest Amaziah, of Beth-el, who
informed against the prophet before King Jeroboam of Israel, did him no
harm, for the king, idolater though he was, entertained profound respect
for Amos. He said to himself: "God forbid I should think the prophet
guilty of cherishing traitorous plans, and if he were, it would surely
be at the bidding of God." For this pious disposition Jeroboam was
rewarded; never had the northern kingdom attained to such power as under
him.

However, the fearlessness of Amos finally caused his death. King Uzziah
inflicted a mortal blow upon his forehead with a red-hot iron.

Two years after Amos ceased to prophesy, Isaiah was favored with his
first Divine communication. It was the day on which King Uzziah, blinded
by success and prosperity, arrogated to himself the privileges of the
priesthood. He tried to offer sacrifices upon the altar, and when the
high priest Azariah ventured to restrain him, he threatened to slay him
and any priest sympathizing with him unless they kept silent. Suddenly
the earth quaked so violently that a great breach was torn in the
Temple, through which a brilliant ray of sunlight pierced, falling upon
the forehead of the king and causing leprosy to break forth upon him.
Nor was that all the damage done by the earthquake. On the west side of
Jerusalem, half of the mountain was split off and hurled to the east,
into a road, at a distance of four stadia. And not heaven and earth
alone were outraged by Uzziah's atrocity and sought to annihilate him;
even the angels of fire, the seraphim, were on the point of descending
and consuming him, when a voice from on high proclaimed, that the
punishment appointed for Uzziah was unlike that meted out to Korah and
his company despite the similarity of their crimes.

When Isaiah beheld the august throne of God on this memorable day, he
was sorely affrighted, for he reproached himself with not having tried
to turn the king away from his impious desire. Enthralled he hearkened
to the hymns of praise sung by the angels, and lost in admiration he
failed to join his voice with theirs. "Woe is me," he cried out, "that I
was silent! Woe is me that I did not join the chorus of the angels
praising God! Had I done it, I, too, like the angels, would have become
immortal, seeing I was permitted to look upon sights to behold which had
brought death to other men." Then he began to excuse himself: "I am a
man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean
lips." At once resounded the voice of God in rebuke: "Of thyself thou
art the master, and of thyself thou mayest say what thou choosest, but
who gave thee the right to calumniate My children of Israel and call
them 'a people of unclean lips'?" And Isaiah heard God bid one of the
seraphim touch his lips with a live coal as a punishment for having
slandered Israel. Though the coal was so hot that the seraph needed
tongs to hold the tongs with which he had taken the coal from the altar,
the prophet yet escaped unscathed, but he learned the lesson, that it
was his duty to defend Israel, not traduce him. Thenceforth the
championship of his people was the mainspring of the prophet's activity,
and he was rewarded by having more revelations concerning Israel and the
other nations vouchsafed him than any other prophet before or after him.
Moreover God designated Isaiah to be "the prophet of consolation." Thus
it happened that the very Isaiah whose early prophecies foretold the
exile and the destruction of the Temple, later described and proclaimed,
in plainer terms than any other prophet, the brilliant destiny in store
for Israel.

### THE TWO KINGDOMS CHASTISED

Afflicted with leprosy, Uzziah was unfit to reign as king, and Jotham
administered the affairs of Judah for twenty-five years before the death
of his father. Jotham possessed so much piety that his virtues added to
those of two other very pious men suffice to atone for all the sins of
the whole of mankind committed from the hour of creation until the end
of all time.

Ahaz, the son of Jotham; was very unlike him. "From first to last he was
a sinner." He abolished the true worship of God, forbade the study of
the Torah, set up an idol in the upper room of the Temple, and
disregarded the Jewish laws of marriage. His transgressions are the less
pardonable, because he sinned against God knowing His grandeur and
power, as appears from his reply to the prophet. Isaiah said to him:
"Ask a sign of God, as, for instance, that the dead should arise, Korah
come up from Sheol, or Elijah descend from heaven." The king's answer
was: "I know thou hast the power to do any of these, but I do not wish
the Name of God to be glorified through me."

The only good quality possessed by Ahaz was respect for Isaiah. To avoid
his reproaches, Ahaz would disguise himself when he went abroad, so that
the prophet might not recognize him. Only to this circumstance, joined
to the fact he was the father of a pious son and the son of an equally
pious father, is it to be ascribed that, in spite of his wickedness,
Ahaz is not one of those who have forfeited their portion in the world
to come. But he did not escape punishment; on the contrary, his
chastisement was severe, not only as king but also as man. In the
ill-starred war against Pekah, the king of the northern kingdom, he lost
his first-born son, a great hero.

Pekah, however, was not permitted to enjoy the fruits of his victory,
for the king of Assyria invaded his empire, captured the golden calf at
Dan, and led the tribes on the east side of Jordan away into exile. The
dismemberment of the Israelitish kingdom went on apace for some years.
Then the Assyrians, in the reign of Hoshea, carried off the second
golden calf together with the tribes of Asher, Issachar, Zebulon, and
Naphtali, leaving but one-eighth of the Israelites in their own land.
The larger portion of the exiles was taken to Damascus. After that
Israel's doom overtook it with giant strides, and the last ruler of
Israel actually hastened the end of his kingdom by a pious deed. After
the golden calves were removed by the Assyrians, Hoshea, the king of the
north, abolished the institution of stationing the guards on the
frontier between Judah and Israel to prevent pilgrimages to Jerusalem.
But the people made no use of the liberty granted them. They persisted
in their idolatrous cult, and this quickened their punishment. So long
as their kings had put obstacles in their path, they could excuse
themselves before God for not worshipping Him in the true way. The
action taken by their king Hoshea left them no defense. When the
Assyrians made their third incursion into Israel, the kingdom of the
north was destroyed forever, and the people, one and all, were carried
away into exile.

The heathen nations settled in Samaria by the Assyrians instead of the
deported Ten Tribes were forced by God to accept the true religion of
the Jews. Nevertheless they continued to worship their olden idols: the
Babylonians paid devotion to a hen, the people of Cuthah to a cock,
those of Hamath to a ram, the dog and the ass were the gods of the
Avvites, and the mule and the horse the gods of the Sepharvites.

### HEZEKIAH

While the northern kingdom was rapidly descending into the pit of
destruction, a mighty upward impulse was given to Judah, both
spiritually and materially, by its king Hezekiah. In his infancy the
king had been destined as a sacrifice to Moloch. His mother had saved
him from death only by rubbing him with the blood of a salamander, which
made him fire-proof. In every respect he was the opposite of his father.
As the latter is counted among the worst of sinners, so Hezekiah is
counted among the most pious of Israel. His first act as king is
evidence that he held the honor of God to be his chief concern,
important beyond all else. He refused to accord his father regal
obsequies; his remains were buried as though he had been poor and of
plebeian rank. Impious as he was, Ahaz deserved nothing more dignified.
God had Himself made it known to Hezekiah, by a sign, that his father
was to have no consideration paid him. On the day of the dead king's
funeral daylight lasted but two hours, and his body had to be interred
when the earth was enveloped in darkness.

Throughout his reign, Hezekiah devoted himself mainly to the task of
dispelling the ignorance of the Torah which his father had caused. While
Ahaz had forbidden the study of the law, Hezekiah's orders read: "Who
does not occupy himself with the Torah, renders himself subject to the
death penalty." The academies closed under Ahaz were kept open day and
night under Hezekiah. The king himself supplied the oil needed for
illuminating purposes. Gradually, under this system, a generation grew
up so well trained that one could search the land from Dan even to
Beer-sheba and not find a single ignoramus. The very women and the
children, both boys and girls, knew the laws of "clean and unclean." By
way of rewarding his piety, God granted Hezekiah a brilliant victory
over Sennacherib.

This Assyrian king, who had conquered the whole world, equipped an army
against Hezekiah like unto which there is none, unless it be the army of
the four kings whom Abraham routed, or the army to be raised by God and
Magog in the Messianic time. Sennacherib's army consisted of more than
two millions and a half of horsemen, among them forty-five thousand
princes sitting in chariots and surrounded by their paramours, by eighty
thousand armor-clad soldiers, and sixty thousand swordsmen. The camp
extended over a space of four hundred parasangs, and the saddle-beasts
standing neck to neck formed a line forty parasangs long. The host was
divided into four divisions. After the first of them had passed the
Jordan, it was well nigh dry, for the soldiers had all slaked their
thirst with water of the river. The second division found nothing to
quench their thirst except the water gathered under the hoofs of the
horses. The third division was forced to dig wells, and when the fourth
division crossed the Jordan, they kicked up great clouds of dust.

With this vast army Sennacherib hastened onward, in accordance with the
disclosures of the astrologers, who warned him that he would fail in his
object of capturing Jerusalem, if he arrived there later than the day
set by them. His journey having lasted but one day instead of ten, as he
had expected, he rested at Nob. A raised platform was there erected for
Sennacherib, whence he could view Jerusalem. On first beholding the
Judean capital, the Assyrian king exclaimed: "What! Is this Jerusalem,
the city for whose sake I gathered together my whole army, for whose
sake I first conquered all other lands? Is it not smaller and weaker
than all the cities of the nations I subdued with my strong hand?" He
stretched himself and shook his head, and waved his hand contemptuously
toward the Temple mount and the sanctuary crowning it. When his warriors
urged him to make his attack upon Jerusalem, he bade them take their
ease for one night, and be prepared to storm the city the next day. It
seemed no great undertaking. Each warrior would but have to pick up as
much mortar from the wall as is needed to seal a letter and the whole
city would disappear. But Sennacherib made the mistake of not proceeding
directly to the attack upon the city. If he had made the assault at
once, it would have been successful, for the sin of Saul against the
priest at Nob had not yet been wholly expiated; on that very day it was
fully atoned for. In the following night, which was the Passover night,
when Hezekiah and the people began to sing the Hallel Psalms, the giant
host was annihilated. The archangel Gabriel sent by God to ripen the
fruits of the field, was charged to address himself to the task of
making away with the Assyrians, and he fulfilled his mission so well
that of all the millions of the army, Sennacherib alone was saved with
his two sons, his son-in-law Nebuchadnezzar, and Nebuzaradan. The death
of the Assyrians happened when the angel permitted them to hear the
"song of the celestials." Their souls were burnt, though their garments
remained intact. Such an end was too good for Sennacherib. To him a
disgraceful death was apportioned. On his flight away from Jerusalem, he
met a Divine apparition in the guise of an old man. He questioned
Sennacherib as to what he would say to the kings allied with him, in
reply to their inquiry about the fate of their sons at Jerusalem.
Sennacherib confessed his dread of a meeting with those kings. The old
man advised him to have his hair cut off, which would change his
appearance beyond recognition. Sennacherib assented, and his advisor
sent him to a house in the vicinity to fetch a pair of shears. Here he
found some people angels in disguise busying themselves with a
hand-mill. They promised to give him the shears, provided he ground a
measure of grain for them. So it grew late and dark by the time
Sennacherib returned to the old man, and he had to procure a light
before his hair could be cut. As he fanned the fire into a flame, a
spark flew into his beard and singed it, and he had to sacrifice his
beard as well as his hair. On his return to Assyria, Sennacherib found a
plank, which he worshipped as an idol, because it was part of the ark
which had saved Noah from the deluge. He vowed that he would sacrifice
his sons to this idol if he prospered in his next ventures. But his sons
heard his vows, and they killed their father, and fled to Kardu where
they released the Jewish captives confined there in great numbers. With
these they marched to Jerusalem, and became proselytes there. The famous
scholars Shemaiah and Abtalion were the descendants of these two sons of
Sennacherib.

### MIRACLES WROUGHT FOR HEZEKIAH

The destruction of the Assyrian host delivered Hezekiah from an inner as
well as an outer enemy, for he had opponents in Jerusalem, among them
the high priest Shebnah. Shebnah had a more numerous following in the
city than the king himself, and they and their leader had favored peace
with Sennacherib. Supported by Joah, another influential personage,
Shebnah had fastened a letter to a dart, and shot the dart into the
Assyrian camp. The contents of the letter were: "We and the whole people
of Israel wish to conclude peace with thee, but Hezekiah and Isaiah will
not permit it." Shebnah's influence was so powerful that Hezekiah began
to show signs of yielding. Had it not been for the prophet Isaiah, the
king would have submitted to Sennacherib's demands.

Shebnah's treachery and his other sins did not go unpunished. When he
and his band of adherents left Jerusalem to join the Assyrians, the
angel Gabriel closed the gate as soon as Shebnah had passed beyond it,
and so he was separated from his followers. To the inquiry of
Sennacherib about the many sympathizers he had written of, he could give
no reply but that they had changed their mind. The Assyrian king thought
Shebnah had made sport of him. He, therefore, ordered his attendants to
bore a hole through his heels, tie him to the tail of a horse by them,
and spur the horse on to run until Shebnah was dragged to death.

The unexpected victory won by Hezekiah over the Assyrians, to whom the
kingdom of Samaria had fallen a prey but a short time before, showed how
wrong they had been who had mocked at Hezekiah for his frugal ways. A
king whose meal consisted of a handful of vegetables could hardly be
called a dignified ruler, they had said. These critics would gladly have
seen his kingdom pass into the hands of Pekah, the king of Samaria,
whose dessert, to speak of nothing else, consisted of forty seim of
young pigeons.

In view of all the wonders God had done for him, it was unpardonable
that Hezekiah did not feel himself prompted at least to sing a song of
praise to God. Indeed, when the prophet Isaiah urged him to it, he
refused, saying that the study of the Torah, to which he devoted himself
with assiduous zeal, was a substitute for direct expressions of
gratitude. Besides, he thought God's miracles would become known to the
world without action on his part, in such ways as these: After the
destruction of the Assyrian army, when the Jews searched the abandoned
camps, they found Pharaoh the king of Egypt and the Ethiopian king
Tirhakah. These kings had hastened to the aid of Hezekiah, and the
Assyrians had taken them captive and clapped them in irons, in which
they were languishing when the Jews came upon them. Liberated by
Hezekiah, the two rulers returned to their respective realms, spreading
the report of the greatness of God everywhere. And again, all the vassal
troops in Sennacherib's army, set free by Hezekiah, accepted the Jewish
faith, and on their way home they proclaimed the kingdom of God in Egypt
and in many other lands.

By failing in gratitude Hezekiah lost a great opportunity. The Divine
plan had been to make Hezekiah the Messiah, and Sennacherib was to be
God and Magog. Justice opposed this plan, addressing God thus: "O Lord
of the world! David, king of Israel, who sang so many songs and hymns of
praise to Thee, him Thou didst not make the Messiah, and now Thou
wouldst confer the distinction upon Hezekiah, who has no word of praise
for Thee in spite of the manifold wonders Thou hast wrought for him?"
Then the earth appeared before God, and said: "Lord of the world! I will
song Thee a song in place of this righteous man; make him to be the
Messiah," and the earth forthwith intoned a song of praise. Likewise
spake the Prince of the World: "Lord of the world! Do the will of this
righteous man." But a voice from heaven announced: "This is my secret,
this is my secret." And again, when the prophet exclaimed sorrowfully,
"Woe is me! How long, O Lord, how long!" the voice replied: "The time of
the Messiah will arrive when the 'treacherous dealers and the
treacherous dealers' shall have come."

The sin committed by Hezekiah asleep, he had to atone for awake. If he
refused to devote a song of praise to God for his escape from the
Assyrian peril, he could not refrain from doing it after his recovery
from the dangerous sickness that befell him. This sickness was a
punishment for another sin beside ingratitude. He had "peeled off" the
gold from the Temple, and sent it to the king of the Assyrians;
therefore the disease that afflicted him caused his skin to "peel off."
Moreover, this malady of Hezekiah's was brought upon him by God, to
afford an opportunity for the king and the prophet Isaiah to come close
to each other. The two had had a dispute on a point of etiquette. The
king adduced as a precedent the action of Elijah, who "went to show
himself unto Ahab," and demanded that Isaiah, too, should appear before
him. The prophet, on the other hand, modelled his conduct after
Elisha's, who permitted the kings of Israel, and Judah, and Edom, to
come to him. But God settled the dispute by afflicting Hezekiah with
sickness, and then He bade Isaiah go to the king and pay the visit due
to the sick. The prophet did the bidding of God. When he appeared in the
presence of the ailing king, he said: "Set thine house in order, for
thou wilt die in this world and not live in the next" a fate which
Hezekiah incurred because he had failed to take unto himself a wife and
bring forth posterity. The king's defense, that he had preferred a
celibate's life because he had seen in the holy spirit that he was
destined to have impious children, the prophet did not consider valid.
He rebutted it with the words: "Why does thou concern thyself with the
secrets of the All-Merciful? Thou hast but to do thy duty. God will do
whatsoever it pleases Him." Thereupon Hezekiah asked the daughter of the
prophet in marriage, saying: "Perchance my merits joined to thine will
cause my children to be virtuous." But Isaiah rejected the proposal of
marriage, because he knew that the decree of God ordaining the king's
death was unalterable. Whereupon the king: "Thou son of thus has it been
transmitted to me from the house of my ancestor: Even if a sharp sword
rests at the very throat of a man, he may yet not refrain from uttering
a prayer for mercy."

And the king was right. Though death had been decreed against him, his
prayer averted it. In his prayer he supplicated God to keep him alive
for the sake of the merits of his ancestors, who had built the Temple
and brought many proselytes into the Jewish fold, and for the sake of
his own merits, for, he said, "I searched out all the two hundred and
forty-eight members of my body which Thou didst give me, and I found
none which I had used in a manner contrary to Thy will."

His prayer was heard. God added fifteen years to his life, but He made
him understand very clearly, that he owed the mercy solely to the merits
of David, not at all to his own, as Hezekiah fondly believed. Before
Isaiah left the court of the palace, God instructed him to return to the
king, and announce his recovery to him. Isaiah feared lest Hezekiah
should place little trust in his words, as he had but a short while
before predicted his swiftly approaching end. But God reassured the
prophet. In his modesty and piety, the king would harbor no doubt
derogatory to the prophet's trustworthiness. The remedy employed by
Isaiah, a cake of figs applied to the boil, increased the wonder of
Hezekiah's recovery, for it was apt to aggravate the malady rather than
alleviate it.

A number of miracles besides were connected with the recovery of
Hezekiah. In itself it was remarkable, as being the first case of a
recovery on record. Previously illness had been inevitably followed by
death. Before he had fallen sick, Hezekiah himself had implored God to
change this order of nature. He held that sickness followed by
restoration to health would induce men to do penance. God had replied:
"Thou art right, and the new order shall be begun with thee."
Furthermore, the day of Hezekiah's recovery was marked by the great
miracle that the sun shone ten hours longer than its wonted time. The
remotest lands were amazed thereat, and Baladan, the ruler of Babylon,
was prompted by it to send an embassy to Hezekiah, which was to carry
his felicitations to the Jewish king upon his recovery. Baladan, it
should be said by the way, was not the real king of Babylon. The throne
was occupied by his father, whose face had changed into that of a dog.
Therefore the son had to administer the affairs of state, and he was
known by his father's name as well as his own. This Baladan was in the
habit of dining at noon, and then he took a nap until three o'clock of
the afternoon. On the day of Hezekiah's recovery, when he awoke from his
sleep, and saw the sun overhead, he was on the point of having his
guards executed, because he thought they had permitted him to sleep a
whole afternoon and the night following it. He desisted only when he was
informed of Hezekiah's miraculous recovery, and realised that the God of
Hezekiah was greater than his own god, the sun. He at once set about
sending greetings to the Jewish king. His letter read as follows: "Peace
be with Hezekiah, peace with his great God, and peace with Jerusalem."
After the letter was dispatched, it occurred to Baladan that it had not
been composed properly. Mention of Hezekiah had been made before mention
of God. He had the messengers called back, and ordered another letter to
be written, in which the oversight was made good. As a reward for his
punctiliousness, three of his descendants, Nebuchadnezzar,
Evil-merodach, and Belshazzar, were appointed by God to be world
monarchs. God said: "Thou didst arise from thy throne, and didst take
three steps to do Me honor, by having thy letter re-written, therefore
will I grant thee three descendants who shall be known from one end of
the world to the other."

The embassy sent by the Babylonian monarch was an act of homage to God
for his miracle-working power. Hezekiah, however, took it to be an act
of homage toward himself, and it had the effect of making him arrogant.
Not only did he eat and drink with the heathen who made up the embassy,
but also, in his haughtiness of mind, he displayed before them all the
treasures which he had captured from Sennacherib, and many other
curiosities besides, among them magnetic iron, a peculiar sort of ivory,
and honey as solid as stone.

What was worse, he had his wife partake of the meal in honor of the
embassy, and, most heinous crime of all, he opened the holy Ark, and
pointing to the tables of law within it, said to the heathen: "With the
help of these we undertake wars and win victories." God sent Isaiah to
reproach Hezekiah for these acts. The king, instead of confessing his
wrong at once, answered the prophet haughtily. Then Isaiah announced to
him that the treasures taken from Sennacherib would revert to Babylon
some time in the future, and his descendants, Daniel and the three
companions of Daniel, would serve the Babylonia ruler as eunuchs.

Despite his pride in this case, Hezekiah was one of the most pious kings
of Judah. Especially he is deserving of praise for his efforts to have
Hebrew literature put into writing, for it was Hezekiah who had copies
made of the books of Isaiah, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, and Proverbs.
On the other hand, he had concealed the books containing medical
remedies.

Great was the mourning over him at his death. No less than thirty-six
thousand men with bared shoulders marched before his bier, and, rarer
distinction still, a scroll of the law was laid upon his bier, for it
was said: "He who rests in this bier, has fulfilled all ordained in this
book." He was buried next to David and Solomon.

### MANASSEH

Hezekiah had finally yielded to the admonitions of Isaiah, and had taken
a wife unto himself, the daughter of the prophet. But he entered upon
marriage with a heavy heart. His prophetic spirit foretold to him that
the impiousness of the sons he would beget would make their death to be
preferable to their life. These fears were confirmed all too soon. His
two sons, Rabshakeh and Manasseh, showed their complete unlikeness to
their parents in early childhood. Once, when Hezekiah was carrying his
two little ones on his shoulders to the Bet ha-Midrash, he overheard
their conversation. The one said: "Our father's bald head might do for
frying fish." The other rejoined: "It would do well for offering
sacrifices to idols." Enraged by these words, Hezekiah let his sons slip
from his shoulders. Rabshakeh was killed by the fall, but Manasseh
escaped unhurt. Better had it been if Manasseh had shared his brother's
untimely fate. He was spared for naught but murder, idolatry, and other
abominable atrocities.

After Hezekiah had departed this life, Manasseh ceased to serve the God
of his father. He did whatever his evil imagination prompted. The altar
was destroyed, and in the inner space of the Temple he set up an idol
with four faces, copied from the four figures on the throne of God. It
was so placed that from whatever direction one entered the Temple, a
face of the idol confronted him.

As Manasseh was sacrilegious toward God, he was malevolent toward his
fellows. He had fashioned an image so large that it required a thousand
men to carry it. Daily a new force was employed on this task, because
Manasseh had each set of porters killed off at the end of the day's
work. All his acts were calculated to cast contempt upon Judaism and its
tenets. It did not satisfy his evil desire to obliterate the name of God
from the Holy Scriptures; he went so far as to deliver public lectures
whose burden was to ridicule the Torah. Isaiah and the other prophets,
Micah, Joel, and Habakkuk, left Jerusalem and repaired to a mountain in
the desert, that they might be spared the sight of the abominations
practiced by the king. Their abiding-place was disclosed to the king. A
Samaritan, a descendant of the false prophet Zedekiah, had taken refuge
in Jerusalem after the destruction of the Temple. But he did not remain
there long; charges were made against him before the pious king
Hezekiah, and he withdrew to Bethlehem, where he gathered hangers-on
about him. This Samaritan it was who traced the prophets to their
retreat, and lodged accusations against them before Manasseh. The
impious king sat in judgment on Isaiah, and condemned him to death. The
indictment against him was that his prophecies contained teachings in
contradiction with the law of Moses. God said unto Moses: "Thou canst
not see My face; for man shall not see Me and live"; while Isaiah said:
"I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up." Again,
Isaiah compared the princes of Israel and the people with the impious
inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, and he prophesied the downfall of
Jerusalem and the destruction of the Temple. The prophet offered no
explanation. He was convinced of the uselessness of defending himself,
and he preferred Manasseh should act from ignorance rather than from
wickedness. However, he fled for safety. When he heard the royal
bailiffs in pursuit of him, he pronounced the Name of God, and a
cedar-tree swallowed him up. The king ordered the tree to be sawn in
pieces. When the saw was applied to the portion of the bark under which
the mouth of Isaiah lay concealed, he died. His mouth was the only
vulnerable part of his body, because at the time when he was called to
his prophetical mission, it had made use of the contemptuous words "a
people of unclean lips," regarding Israel. Isaiah died at the age of one
hundred and twenty years, by the hands of his own grandchild.

God is long-suffering, but in the end Manasseh received the deserved
punishment for his sins and crimes. In the twenty-second year of his
rulership, the Assyrians came and carried him off to Babylon in fetters,
him together with the old Danite idol, Micah's image. In Babylonia, the
king was put into an oven which was heated from below. Finding himself
in this extremity, Manasseh began to call upon god after god to help him
out of his straits. As this proved inefficacious, he resorted to other
means. "I remember," he said, "my father taught me the verse: 'When thou
art in tribulation, if in the latter days thou shalt return to the Lord
thy God, and hearken unto His voice, He will not fail thee.' Now I cry
to God. If He inclines His ear unto me, well and good; if not, then all
kinds of god are alike." The angels stopped up the windows of heaven,
that the prayer of Manasseh might not ascend to God, and they said:
"Lord of the world! Art Thou willing to give gracious hearing to one who
has paid worship to idols, and set up an idol in the Temple?" "If I did
not accept the penance of this man," replied God, "I should be closing
the door in the face of all repentant sinners." God made a small opening
under the Throne of His Glory, and received the prayer of Manasseh
through it. Suddenly a wind arose, and carried Manasseh back to
Jerusalem. His return to God not only helped him in his distress, but
also brought him pardon for all his sins, so that not even his share in
the future world was withdrawn from him.

The people of this time were attracted to idolatry with so irresistible
a force that the vast learning of Manasseh, who knew fifty-two different
interpretations of the Book of Leviticus, did not give him enough moral
strength to withstand its influence. Rab Ashi, the famous compiler of
the Talmud, once announced a lecture on Manasseh with the words:
"To-morrow I shall speak about our colleague Manasseh." At night the
king appeared to Ashi in a dreams, and put a ritual question to him,
which the Rabbi could not answer. Manasseh told him the solution, and
Ashi, in amazement at the king's scholarship, asked why one so erudite
had served idols. Manasseh's reply was: "Hadst thou lived at my time,
thou wouldst have caught hold of the hem of my garment and run after
me."

Amon, the son of Manasseh, surpassed his father in wickedness. He was in
the habit of saying: "My father was a sinner from early childhood, and
in his old age he did penance. I shall do the same. First I shall
satisfy the desires of my heart, and afterward I shall return to God."
Indeed, he was guilty of more grievous sins than his predecessor; he
burned the Torah; under him the place of the altar was covered with
spiderwebs; and, as though of purpose to set at naught the Jewish
religion, he committed the worst sort of incest, a degree more heinous
than his father's crime of a similar nature. Thus he executed the first
half of his maxim literally. For repentance, however, he was given no
time; death cut him off in the fulness of his sinful ways.

### JOSIAH AND HIS SUCCESSORS

That the full measure of punishment was not meted out to Amon his evil
deeds were such that he should have forfeited his share in the world to
come was due to the circumstance that he had a pious and righteous son.
Josiah offers a shining model of true, sincere repentance. Though at
first he followed in the footsteps of his father Amon, he soon gave up
the ways of wickedness, and became one of the most pious kings of
Israel, whose chief undertaking was the effort to bring the whole people
back to the true faith. It dates from the time when a copy of the Torah
was found in the Temple, a copy that had escaped the holocaust kindled
by his father and predecessor Amon for the purpose of exterminating the
Holy Scriptures. When he opened the Scriptures, the first verse to
strike his eye was the one in Deuteronomy: "The Lord shall bring thee
and thy king into exile, unto a nation which thou hast not known."
Josiah feared this doom of exile was impending, and he sought to
conciliate God through the reform of his people.

His first step was to enlist the intercession of the prophets in his
behalf. He addressed his request, not to Jeremiah, but to the prophetess
Huldah, knowing that women are more easily moved to compassion. As
Jeremiah was a kinsman of the prophetess their common ancestors were
Joshua and Rahab the king felt no apprehension that the prophet take his
preference for Huldah amiss. The proud, dignified answer of the
prophetess was, that the misfortune could not be averted from Israel,
but the destruction of the Temple, she continued consolingly, would not
happen until after the death of Josiah. In view of the imminent
destruction of the Temple, Josiah hid the holy Ark and all its
appurtenances, in order to guard them against desecration at the hands
of the enemy.

The efforts of the king in behalf of God and His law found no echo with
the great majority of the people. Though the king was successful in
preventing the worship of idols in public, his subjects knew how to
deceive him. Josiah sent out his pious sympathizers to inspect the
houses of the people, and he was satisfied with their report, that they
had found no idols, not suspecting that the recreant people has fastened
half an image on each wing of the doors, so that the inmates faced their
household idols as they closed the door upon Josiah's inspectors.

This godless generation contemporaneous with Josiah was to blame for his
death. When King Pharaoh, in his campaign against the Assyrians, wanted
to travel through Palestine, Jeremiah advised the king not to deny the
Egyptians the passage through his land. He cited a prophecy by his
teacher Isaiah, who had foreseen the war between Assyria and Egypt. But
Josiah retorted: "Moses, thy teacher's teacher, spake: 'I will give
peace in the land, and no sword shall go through your land,' not even
the sword that is not raised against Israel with hostile intent." The
king, innocent of the deception practiced by the people, knew not that
they were idol worshippers, to whom the promises of the Torah have no
application. In the engagement that ensued between the Jews and the
Egyptians, no less than three hundred darts struck the king. In his
death agony he uttered no word of complaint; he only said: "The Lord is
righteous, for I have rebelled against His commandment," thus admitting
his guilt in not having heeded the advice of the prophet.

So ended the days of this just king after a brilliant career, the only
king since Solomon to rule over both Judah and Israel, for Jeremiah had
brought back to Palestine the ten exiled tribes of the north, and made
them subject to Josiah. The mourning for him was profound. Even Jeremiah
perpetuated his memory in his Lamentations.

Pharaoh of Egypt was not permitted to enjoy the results of his victory
to the full, for it was soon after this that, in attempting to ascend
the wondrous throne of Solomon, he was stuck down by the lions and
rendered lame by the blow.

The people put Jehoahaz on the throne of Judah to succeed Josiah, though
his brother Jehoiakim was the older by two years. To silence the
legitimate claims of Jehoiakim, the new king underwent the ceremony of
anointing. But his reign was very brief. At the end of three months
Pharaoh carried him off into exile in Egypt, and Jehoiakim ruled in his
stead.

Jehoiakim was another of the sinful monarchs of the Jews, uncharitable
toward men and disobedient to God and the laws of God. His garments were
of two kinds of stuff mingled together, his body was tattooed with the
names of idols, and in order that he might appear as a non-Jew, he
performed the operation of an epipost upon himself. Various forms of
incest were committed by him, and, besides, he was in the habit of
putting men to death that he might violate their wives, and confiscate
their possessions. Blasphemous as he was, he spoke: "My predecessors did
not know how to provoke the wrath of God. As for me, I say frankly, we
have no need whatsoever of Him; the very light He gives us we can
dispense with, for the gold of Parvaim can well replace it."

Seeing such abominations, God desired to resolve the world into its
original chaos. If He desisted from His purpose, it was only because the
people led a God-fearing life during the time of Jehoiakim. After he had
reigned eleven years, Nebuchadnezzar put an end to his dominion.
Advancing with his army, the Babylonian king halted at Daphne, a suburb
of Antioch. Here he was met by the Sanhedrin of Jerusalem, who desired
to know whether he was coming with the purpose of destroying the Temple.
Nebuchadnezzar assured them, that all he wanted was the surrender of
Jehoiakim, who had rebelled against his authority. Returned to
Jerusalem, the Sanhedrin informed Jehoiakim of Nebuchadnezzar's
intention. The king asked the elders, whether it was ethical to purchase
their lives by sacrificing his. For answer they referred him to the
story of the way Joab dealt with the city of Abel of Beth-maacah, which
had saved itself by surrendering the rebel Sheba, the son of Bichri. The
king's objections did not deter the Sanhedrin from following the example
of Joab acting under the direction of David. They made Jehoiakim glide
down from the city walls of Jerusalem by a chain. Below, the Babylonians
stood ready to receive him. Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiakim in fetters to
all the cities of Judah, then he slew him, and, his rage still unabated,
threw his corpse to the dogs after having stuck it into the carcass of
an ass. The dogs left nothing of Jehoiakim's body over except his skull,
on which were written the words: "This and something besides." Many
centuries later it was found by a Rabbi near the gates of Jerusalem. He
tried in vain to give it burial; the earth refused to retain it, and the
Rabbi concluded therefrom that it belonged to the corpse of Jehoiakim.
He wrapped the skull in a cloth, and laid it in a closet. One day the
wife of the Rabbi discovered it there, and she burnt it, thinking the
skull belonged to a former wife of her husband, so dear to him even
after her death that he could not separate himself from this relic.

When Nebuchadnezzar returned to Babylonia from his Palestinian
expedition, the people received him with great pomp and solemnity. He
announced to them that in place of Jehoiakim, whom he had slain, he had
installed Mattaniah, the rebel's son, called Jehoiachin, as king over
Judah, and the people uttered the warning: "One cannot educate a
well-behaved puppy whose dam was ill-conditioned; let alone an
ill-conditioned puppy whose dam was ill-conditioned."

Nebuchadnezzar returned to Daphne, and informed the Sanhedrin, who
hastened from Jerusalem to meet him, that he desired the surrender of
Jehoiachin. If they refused to satisfy his demand, he would destroy the
Temple. When the Jewish king was told the threat of his Babylonian
adversary, he mounted upon the roof of the Temple, and, holding all the
keys of its chambers in his hand, he spoke thus to God: "Until now Thou
didst consider us worthy of confidence, and Thou didst entrust Thy keys
to us. Since Thou no longer dost esteem us trustworthy, here, take back
Thy keys." He was held to his word: a hand was stretched forth from
heaven, and it received the keys.

Jehoiachin, good and pious, did not desire the city of Jerusalem to be
exposed to peril for his sake. So he delivered himself to the Babylonian
leaders, after they swore that neither city nor people should suffer
harm. But the Babylonians did not keep their oath. A short while
thereafter they carried into exile, not only the king, but also his
mother, and ten thousand of the Jewish nobility and of the great
scholars. This was the second attempt made by Nebuchadnezzar to deport
the Jews. On taking the former king Jehoiakim captive, he had exiled
three hundred of the noblest of the people, among them the prophet
Ezekiel.

The king Jehoiachin was incarcerated for life, a solitary prisoner,
separated from his wife and his family. The Sanhedrin, who were among
those deported with the king, feared that the house of David die out.
They therefore besought Nebuchadnezzar not to separate Jehoiachin from
his wife. They succeeded in enlisting the sympathy of the queen's
hairdresser, and through her of the queen herself, Semiramis, the wife
of Nebuchadnezzar, who in turn prevailed upon the king to accord mild
treatment to the unfortunate prince exiled from Judea. Suffering had
completely changed the once sinful king, so that, in spite of his great
joy over his reunion with his wife, he still paid regard to the
prescriptions of the Jewish law regulating conjugal life. He was
prepared to deny himself every indulgence, when the purchase price was
an infringement of the word of God. Such steadfastness pleaded with God
to pardon the king for his sins, and the heavenly Sanhedrin absolved God
from His oath, to crush Jehoiachin and deprive his house of sovereignty.
By way of reward for his continence he was blessed with distinguished
posterity. Not only was Zerubbabel, the first governor of Palestine
after the destruction of the Temple, a grandson of Jehoiachin's, but
also the Messiah himself will be a descendant of his.
