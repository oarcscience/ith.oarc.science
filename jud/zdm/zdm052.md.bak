SAID Rabbi Eleazar: "What David beheld at that awful moment was not an
angel but a manifestation of the Holy One. The scripture uses the words
'The Angel of the Lord' as a metaphoric appellation of the Divine Being,
<span class="margnote">61a</span>as did also Jacob when blessing Ephraim
and Manasseh saying, 'The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless
the lads.'<span class="margnote">Gen. 48:16</span> And furthermore, in
Exodus XIV. 19. The Almighty is referred to and designated as 'The Angel
of the Lord that went before the camps of Israel removed and went behind
them.' Whether Israel acts uprightly or not, the Holy One is still its
ruler and governor in order that it may not become subject to other
nations, and that its good works may put them to shame. It may however
be said, yet it is written, 'The adversary hath spread out his hand upon
her pleasant things, for she hath seen the heathen entered into her
sanctuary' (Lam. I. 10). If the Holy One governs Israel as stated, how
was it that the heathen entered her sanctuary and destroyed it?
Scripture itself gives the reason, as it is written, 'Thou hast done all
these things (Jer. XIX. 22).<span class="margnote">Lam. 1:21</span> The
Lord hath done that which he hath devised. He hath fulfilled what he
proposed in days of yore (Lam. II. 19).<span class="margnote">Lam
2:17</span> From these words we conclude and affirm that notwithstanding
the occurrence of all these calamities, the Holy One is still ruler of
Israel and that only by his permission could they have happened.
Observe, scripture states, 'And Alhim looked upon the earth, and behold,
it was corrupt,' because the Schekina had deserted it, as we have said.
Moreover it is stated, 'And God saw their works that they turned from
their evil way' (Ion. III. 14).<span class="margnote">Jonah 3:10</span>
The cry of the earth is always ascending heavenwards and desirous of
union with the celestial world, enrobes itself with raiments of beauty
and splendor, as doth a maiden expecting the arrival of her lover.

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When its children
are upright and virtuous, they become its ornaments. Far otherwise was
it when the deluge came, for then they were vile and depraved and
corrupted, so that the earth blushing with shame at their deeds of
wickedness hid itself, as doth an unfaithful wife from her husband.
When, however, they became brazen, openly lewd, obscene and sensual,
then like an immodest [courtesan](errata.htm#33.md) casting aside her veil,
it also became unclean and corrupted, as it is written 'The earth is
defiled by the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the
laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant' (Is. XXIV.
5). Then corruption both moral and physical prevailed throughout the
world, for all flesh had corrupted it's way upon the earth."<span
class="margnote">61a-61b</span>

Rabbi Eleazer was once on a visit to Rabbi Jose the son of Rabbi Simeon
and grandson of Lakunya, who on beholding him spread a sumptuous couch
on the floor in order to recline and rest himself. After engaging a
while in silent meditation, his grandfather said: "Have you ever heard
your father explain the meaning of the words, 'The Lord hath done that
which he had devised. He hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded
in the days of old?'"<span class="margnote">Lam 2:17</span>

Said Rabbi Eleazar: "Initiated students have interpreted them thus, the
words 'fulfilled his word' (bitza emratho) signify that God hath rent
his purple robe of glory and light with which he had arrayed himself
from the beginning of creation, and contributed to the beauty and
perfection of his sanctuary."

Then asked his grandfather again: "Does a king think or devise
punishment before his son has acted wickedly?"

To this Rabbi Eleazar replied; "A certain king possessed a most costly
and precious vase. Fearing the loss of it, he caused it to be
continually placed before him. At length his son came to visit him and
on a dispute arising between them, the king in a moment of anger seized
hold of the vase and dashed it to pieces on the ground. Such is the
signification of the words; 'The Lord hath done what he had devised.'
Observe, from the day the sanctuary was finished and completed, the Lord
regarded it with continuous joy and delight, yet fearing that Israel
would act wickedly, he determined it should be destroyed. Whilst Israel
kept the good law and lived in obedience to its dictates, purely and
uprightly, there was the sanctuary the glory of God on the earth, but
when Israel fell with idolatry and forsook his worship it was destroyed.
At its destruction then only did the Holy One

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

feel grief at the punishment of the guilty. On all other occasions it is
a source of delight to him when the wicked through their misdeeds are
swept out of the world, as it is written, 'When the wicked perish there
is shouting.' (Prov. XI. 10). If, however, it be objected, we are taught
that the Holy One never rejoices at the punishment of the evildoer
observe that punishment is twofold in its character. There is the
punishment of those who, despite the admonitions and long-suffering of
God, continue in their wickedness. The suffering of these causes joy to
the Holy One. There is also the punishment of those whose perversity in
crime has not attained its climax. Far from being a source of joy to
him, their suffering causes the Holy One to sorrow and grieve over them.
There are wretches who are afflicted before their wickedness has reached
its culmination, as it is written, 'For the iniquity of the Amorites is
not yet full' (Gen. XV. 16). If, again, it be asked, wherefore God
chastises sometimes those whose iniquity is not full? We answer,
evildoers whose bad deeds injure only themselves are punished only when
the measure of their iniquity is filled, whilst the unrighteous who
attach themselves to Israel with the object of afflicting and injuring
it are punished before their evil intentions are realized. It is the
chastisement of this class of evildoers that causes grief to the Holy
One. Amongst such were the Egyptians that were drowned in the Red Sea,
and the enemies of Israel in the time of [Jehoshaphat](errata.htm#34.md) It
is written: 'For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the
earth, forty days and forty nights, and every living substance that I
have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth'" (Gen. VII. 4).

Said Rabbi Jehuda: "Wherefore this limit of forty days and nights? It
was because this number is always found in connection with the
infliction of punishment, as it is written, 'Forty stripes he may give
him and not exceed' (Deuter. XXV. 3). This number is fixed to correspond
with the four cardinal quarters of the world, each of which is divided
into ten parts or degrees as man was created to correspond with them in
a manner, for the commission of crime he must not he beaten with more
than forty stripes. For a like reason, this number forty was equally
necessary in the punishment of the world."

Rabbi Isaac was sitting in presence of Rabbi Simeon, and in course of
conversation asked the question: "What is the real meaning of the words,
'And the earth was corrupt before the Alhim.' Though man commit crime
how can it affect the earth and make it corrupt?"

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

Rabbi Simeon replied: "Scripture informs us that the earth and all flesh
upon it had together become corrupt. There is found another and similar
expression or statement, 'And the land is defiled and therefore I do
visit the iniquity thereof upon it.' Now, if it be said, though men
sinned, how could their crimes cause the earth to be corrupt, so that
along with them it is subject to punishment? Observe that the sins of
mankind that corrupt it are effaceable by repentance except that of
self-defilement; and so scripture states, 'Though thou wash thee with
nitre and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me
saith the Lord God' (Jer. II. 22); and again, 'For thou art not a God
that hath pleasure in wickedness, neither shall evil dwell with thee'
(Ps. V. 5). Only by extraordinary penitence can this heinous sin be
expiated, respecting which it is written, 'And Er the elder son of Judah
was wicked before the Lord, and the Lord slew him'" (Gen. XXXVIII. 7),
which verse has already been commented upon.

Again Rabbi Isaac questioned Rabbi Simeon: "Wherefore did God punish the
antediluvians by a deluge of water rather than by fire or some other
scourge?"

Rabbi Simeon replied: "Therein is involved a deep mystery. In indulging
in the heinous sin of self [pollution](errata.htm#35.md) man impeded and
prevented the union of the waters above with the waters below, or in
other words, the male and female principles, and as therefore punished
by a watery element; so that in their case the punishment fit the crime.
Scripture states, 'All the foundations of the great deep were broken up
and the windows of heaven were opened.' (Gen. VII. 4). The fountains of
the great deep refer to the waters below, and the windows of heaven to
the waters above."

Rabbi Hiya and Rabbi Jehuda when traveling, passed near some great and
lofty mountains, in the gorges and fissures of which they observed
bleached skeletons of the remains of men who had perished in the deluge.
They measured two hundred feet as they extended on the rocks. Overcome
with astonishment, they said: "Now we comprehend what the masters have
told us, why the [antediluvians](errata.htm#36.md) feared not the divine
punishment, as it is written. 'Therefore they say unto God, depart from
us for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways (Job XXI. 14).' But their
haughtiness and pride of strength availed them nothing, for they
perished, swept off the face of the earth by the waters of the deluge."

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

"'And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham and Japhet'",<span
class="margnote">62a-62b</span> (Gen. VI. 10), said Rabbi Hiya to Rabbi
Jehuda, "Come and I will make known unto thee what I have learned as to
the occult meaning and sense of these words. The life of Noah was
similar to a man entering into a cavern, from which after a certain
time, come forth two or three sons, each of them different in character,
habit and temperament, one being upright, one unjust, whilst the third
is void of any special trait of disposition. The same peculiarity and
distinction between individuals obtain alike in the three worlds.
Observe when the soul descends from the celestial sphere or plane in
heaven it becomes as it were entangled in mountain ravines, and meeting
with its lower intellectual self, they take on the animal bodily life,
and thus blended form one individual."

Said Rabbi Jehuda, "The mind and the lower nature depend the one on the
other, but the spirit (the higher or real self) is independent of both
of them. They are located or inhere in the physical organization, but
not it, which as yet has never been discovered or seen by any
individual. When a man leads a pure life, his higher self is present and
aids him in his endeavors, and by its purifying and enlightening
influence enables him to attain to and enter into the enjoyment of the
higher life of peace and bliss unspeakable. If, however he is careless
and unwilling to live the higher life, then though he may become
intellectual. he can never become pure and one with the Divine.
Furthermore, whose lives impurely depraves his nature, and by ignoring
the dictates and admonitions of the spirit within him renders himself
more and more receptive of and swayed by objects of sense in following
the bent of his animal appetites and inclinations."

It is written, "And God said unto Noah, 'the end of all flesh is come
before me'" (Gen. VI. 12). Said Rabbi Jehuda: "David says, 'make me to
know mine end and the measure of my days, what it is, that I may know
how frail I am.' From these words addressed unto the Holy One, we learn
that there are two ends, one on the right hand, the other on the left,
which man must choose to walk in during his life on earth. Of that on
the right it is written, 'Go thou thy way until the end be, for thou
shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of thy days' (Dan. XII. 13).
Of that on the left it is said, 'He setteth an end to darkness and
searcheth out all perfection, the stones of darkness and the shadow of
death. He considereth the depth of all

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

things.' (Job XXVIII. 3.). When by affliction and suffering the stones
buried in darkness become manifested and the shadow of death hovers
over, then the end of darkness becomes visible, or in other words, the
angel of death or the serpent. Thus 'the end of all flesh' has the same
meaning as the words 'the end of darkness,' that is, the death angel or
the serpent. 'He considereth the depth of all things' refers to the same
being who, when<span class="margnote">62b-63a</span> judgment falls upon
the world, constitutes himself the satan or accurser of mankind and
strives to disparage and blacken the characters of all creatures. With
reference to the end on the right, the Holy One said to Daniel, 'Go thy
way till the end come, for thou shalt rest.' Thereupon Daniel turned and
said, 'In which world shall my rest be, in this or the world to come?'
'In this world,' replied the Holy One, "where rest is necessary, 'as it
is written, 'He who walks in the right way shall rest in his bed' (Is.
LVII. 2). Then asked Daniel again of the Holy One, 'Shall I be of the
number of those who will rise again at the end of the world?' The Holy
One replied 'Thou, shalt rise.' Said Daniel then 'I know that amongst
these who shall rise, there will be upright and just men who during
their lives on earth walked in the path of truth, and others there will
be who have done wickedly, but as yet I know not amongst which I shall
rise again.' Said the Holy One, 'In thy lot or state in which thou
diest.' Again Daniel spake and said, "Thou sayest unto me, 'Go thou thy
way to the end (lekh lecetz). There is an end on the right and an end on
the left, which of these meanest thou?'" 'The end on the right,'
answered the Holy One. David also said unto the Lord, 'Make me to know
my end,' and found no rest until he knew which it would be, and it was
said unto him, 'Sit thou on my right hand.'<span class="margnote">Ps.
110:1</span> Observe, the Holy One also spake unto Noah, 'The end of all
flesh has come before me.' What does the word 'end' here mean? It is
that which causes the faces of all creatures to become pale and
darkened. Hence we learn that the worldly minded and impious attract to
themselves this end or state that causes the hue and complexion of their
visages to become dark and gloomy. This unknown something or terror
called 'the end' does not seize hold of anyone except by permission from
on high. When God spake to Noah, it was present before him, waiting for
his word of authority to seize hold of the antediluvians, and then he
added, 'I will destroy them with the earth,' at the same time saying
unto Noah 'Make thee an ark of gopher wood,' in order to protect himself
and ward off the attack

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

of the death angel that he may have no power over him. Observe, we have
heard that when death invades a city or enters into the world abroad, a
man should not walk in the public streets and thoroughfares if he wishes
to avoid the death angel, who then has the power to afflict and destroy
anyone whom he meets and encounters. Therefore, was it the Holy One said
unto Noah, 'Thou must conceal thyself within the ark and so avoid
meeting the destroying angel and thus be secure from his lethal power.'
If it be said, there was no such being existing at the time of the
deluge whose waters caused the destruction of the human race, observe
that no judgment has ever overwhelmed the world but what this malefic
angel has been present to inflict it. At the time of the Flood, he was
present in the water which was an instrument used by him, and so God
warned Noah and counselled him to avoid his presence by building and
entering into the ark. But if it be furthermore asked, what advantage
could accrue to the patriarch by so doing? How could that prevent the
entrance into it of the destroyer? Our reply is, that he has no power
over anyone so long as he keeps himself out of his sight. We gather this
from what happened to the Egyptians, since God commanded, 'Let none of
you go out of the door of his house until the morning.' (Ex. XII. 22).
What was the reason of this prohibition? That he might avoid meeting the
destroying angel who had the power of inflicting death. Therefore was
Noah admonished to include and hide himself in the ark and thus escape
destruction."

Rabbi Hiya and Rabbi Jose, whilst traveling in Armenia, and passing by
some great and lofty mountains, observed in them vast gorges and deep
ravines resulting from the action of the waters of the deluge. Said
Rabbi Hiya. "These have existed from the time of the flood and, by the
will of the Holy One,<span class="margnote">63a</span> will endure unto
the end of the world as tokens or reminders of the great wickedness of
the [antediluvians](errata.htm#37.md), even as it is his will that by their
good deeds, the memory of the righteous should abide before him and
never be effaced. And even with those who delight not in his service,
their evil works are transmitted and become manifested throughout all
generations, as it is written, 'Though thou wash thyself with nitre and
take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the
Lord God '" (Jer. II. 22).

Said Rabbi Jose "We read, 'Lift up thy voice, Oh daughter of Gallim,
cause it to be heard unto Laish, Oh! poor Anathoth'

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Is. X. 30). These
words already explained apply really to the congregation of Israel. The
daughter of Gallim besides designating the daughter of Abraham our
father, refers also to Israel who in another part of scripture is termed
'a closed fountain:' The term 'Gallim' also signifies rivers, which all
flow towards the garden they fill and irrigate, as it is written, 'Thy
plants are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits' (Cant. IV.
13), cause it to be heard at Laish has the same meaning as 'the lion
(laich) perisheth from lack of prey' (Job. IV. 12). Laish denotes the
male and laishah the female. Wherefore so, is it because scripture
states, 'The lion is strongest amongst beasts and fearless of any it
meets' (Prov. XXX. 30) or 'The lion is dead through lack of prey.' The
true interpretation is in the word laish, an occult term of that mundane
virtue which emanating from on high manifests itself on the earth plane.
When the affluents of the celestial virtue cease descending and are no
longer transformed into the lower mundane power, 'laish' then takes the
name of 'laishah'; that is, it manifests itself as female. The words
'*aniah anathoth* (oh, poor anathoth) signify the same as those (in Jer.
I. 1), namely 'Jeremiah, son of Hilhiah, of the priests who lived in
poverty (ba-anathoth), and also those I Kings II. 26'. And unto
Abiathiar, the priest, said the king, 'get thee to Anathoth, or, rather,
live thou in poverty in thine own fields; the signification of which
words is as<span class="margnote">63a-63b</span> follows: During the
life of David [Abiathar](errata.htm#38.md) lived in wealth and opulence,
but after David's decease Solomon condemned him to live in poverty on
his own laud or property."
