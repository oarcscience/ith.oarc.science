### THE PRAYER OF RABBI SIMEON.

The students had assembled and waited for the master to begin his daily
discourse and exposition of the secret doctrine. Rabbi Simeon, after a
few moments of meditation, prayed and said:

"Oh ye angels on high and ye great teachers of the secret doctrine
taught and expounded in the sacred schools above, assemble yourselves
and be present to note the words and their esoteric meaning that I am
about to make known, and thou, oh Elijah, I conjure by the bond of our
brotherhood, and pray thou mayst be allowed to descend and be present
whilst I explain the mystery of the great struggle between good and evil
in the world, as also of the conflict between light and darkness that
has been, and still is, waged from the beginning; and thou Enoch, great
angel of the Divine Presence! come thou and be present also, along with
the masters of the school over which thou presidest. This I entreat and
supplicate not for my own self, but for the honor and glory of the
Shekina." Then began Rabbi Simeon his discourse.

"Oh Zarka," he said, "it is indeed through thee that our prayers ascend
and reach their destined place on high. As a slinger slings and directs
his stones to a certain mark or object, so should we, whilst praying,
direct and address our prayers to the Divine in a manner of which thou
art the symbol. Therefore the teachings of our forefathers instruct us
that all our desires should be expressed before the pronunciation and
utterance of the divine name, and by standing up cause them to ascend on
high. Prayer should be direct and uninterrupted by anything

whatever, even though it be a serpent entwining itself about our lower
limbs, and always addressed to the Infinite One as we have been taught.
At the repeating of 'Blessed be thou, oh Lord,' every knee should be
bowed, and never by word or act of inattention should the union between
himself and the Divine Being be disrupted. The union of the Shekina with
its heavenly spouse is sometimes effected by passing through six degrees
of the lower limbs of the sephirotic tree. It is for this reason that
during prayer, the knees should be bowed and the six joints of each of
the legs may be emblematic of this union, which is sometimes effected by
passing through six degrees of the arms of the sephirotic tree.
Occasionally, the Shekina ascends on high between the father and the
mother symbolized by the letters yod and he. When it ascends it attains
to the highest position, so that, losing sight of it, the angels
themselves ask, "Where is the place of its glory?" When it rises above
aleph, it forms and becomes a crown, which is called kether (crown).
When, however, the Shekina descends below, it takes the form of a vowel
beneath aleph, and then is called nekudah (point), as the crown above is
called taga in the esoteric science of the accents. When this taga
becomes joined to the Shekina,<span class="margnote">24a-24b</span> the
letter zain is formed, a symbol of the union denoted by the seventh
shephira, and in its form an emblem of the foundation stone of the
universe. This is why it is written; "Thou shalt have a perfect and just
stone" (Deuter. xxv. 15). There is no musical accent which has not its
corresponding vowel point,--thus segoltha coincides with segol, the
accent zakeph with seheva. Those who are acquainted with the esoteric
meaning of the accents will easily find the correspondents of all the
others, such as athnach, munach, etc.
