### RABBI ABBA'S VISIT AND WHAT OCCURRED.

Rabbi Abba of the town of Tiberias went on a visit to his father-in-law,
accompanied by his son, Rabbi Jacob, to attend a meeting of novitiates
of the Hidden Wisdom. On arriving at the village of Tarsha, they decided
to stay there for the night. The keeper of the inn, when Rabbi Abba
asked him whether there was a "Tarnagula" on the house (a cockbird)
replied, why do you ask such a question? In order, said Rabbi Abba, that
at time of midnight I may not fail to rise and engage in the study of
the secret doctrine. Let that not trouble you, rejoined the inn-keeper,
for we have an alarum in the house that never fails to strike and ring
at the hour of midnight. It was the invention of an old man who used to
stay here. He was an esoteric student and most punctual he was in rising
at midnight to study.

Said Rabbi Abba: "Blessed be the Merciful One who guided us hither."

When midnight arrived, the clepsydra or alarum sounded and was heard
throughout the house and awakened Rabbi Abba and his son who, on rising,
heard the inn-keeper, seated on the threshold of the door, saying to his
two sons: "It is written, 'At midnight I will rise and give thanks unto
thee because of thy righteous judgments' (Ps. CXIX. 62). Why did David
say 'midnight' (khatzoth lailah) instead of 'at midnight' (bekhatzoth
lailah) I will rise, etc. It was because that by this word (midnight) he
denotes and distinguishes the Holy One Himself."

Then spake the two sons and said: "Did David really call upon and
address Him thus?"

"Truly he did," replied their father, for at the exact hour of midnight
the Holy One enters the garden of Eden to enjoy intercourse with the
souls of the righteous."

Said Rabbi Abba to his son, Rabbi Jacob: "If we go<span
class="margnote">92b</span> and join them in their study, the presence
of the Schekina will most certainly be with us." They went and sat with
their host and said, repeat the words you have just spoken, for they are
excellent. Who was your teacher?"

He replied: "The old man that formerly stayed here. He also told me that
during three hours before midnight angels, deputed to take record of the
deeds of men that judgment might be pronounced upon them, fly through
the world and return at the exact moment when the Holy One enters the
garden of Eden. All the judgments that befall men and the sentences
decreed in the world above thus become operative. Where do we learn
this? From the history of Abraham, of whom it is written, 'And he
separated the night for them' (Gen. XIV. 15), and also from what is said
regarding the plague of the Egyptians, 'And it came to pass that at
midnight, the Lord smote all the first born in the land of Egypt' (Ex.
XII. 29). In many other places of scripture the old man taught me the
esoteric meaning of the word midnight, of which David himself was well
aware, and knew that his royalty and sovereignty depended on "Midnight"
and therefore he rose at that time and composed psalms and called the
Holy One by this term, in order as he says, 'to praise thee for thy
righteous judgments' which descend from on high at the division of day
and night. David knowing that his occupancy of the throne depended upon
the divine 'Midnight,' he rose as we have just said to sing praises and
give thanks to the King of Kings."

Said Rabbi Abba, as the host ceased speaking: "True are the words thou
hast spoken and blessed he the Lord who has directed our steps and
guided us hither." He then embraced him and said: "Observe that night is
the time of judgment everywhere, as we have learned from Rabbi Simeon."

One of the [inn-keeper's](errata.htm#77.md) sons here asked the question:
"If," said he, to his father, "what you have learned is true, why did
David say, 'In the middle of the night?'"

The father replied: "Because, as we have stated, at that time the rule
and sovereignty of the Holy One makes itself felt by everyone."

Said the son: "There is another explanation which has been imparted to
me."

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span> <span class="margnote">92a</span>

Said Rabbi Abba: "Speak, my boy, and give it forth as I think the Voice
of the Silence<span class="margnote">Voice of the Lamp--Soncino</span>
has spoken unto thee."

The boy spake and said: "Night is the time when judgments are decreed
and determined upon, and during night they are executed in all places
above and below. Why David used the term 'middle' was because the night
is divided into two periods; the first of judgment, the other of mercy
that causes the faces of all to become radiant with feelings of joy and
delight."

Said Rabbi Abba, placing his hands on the head of the boy and blessing
him, "I have always thought that wisdom was only to be found with those
worthy of receiving it, now I see that in the life time of Rabbi Simeon,
children are able to become possessors of heavenly wisdom and light.
Blessed art thou, Rabbi Simeon. Woe to the world when thou goest hence."
Until daybreak they continued their studies of the Secret Doctrine.
