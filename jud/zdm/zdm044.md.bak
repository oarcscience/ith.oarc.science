### THE ANTEDILUVIANS AND THEIR MAGICAL ARTS.

Said Rabbi Jose: "Adam through disobedience to the divine commandment,
lost the knowledge and understanding of the secret doctrine and occult
power and meaning of the letters of the alphabet except the two last,
namely, the letters Shin (S) and Tau (Th), because though he had sinned
yet was not goodness wholly extinguished within him and therefore to
express his feeling of gratitude for this concession, he called his son
Seth. After his repentance and reconciliation with his Lord, the letters
with the knowledge of their mystical meaning and power became known
again to him, but in their reverse order thus, Th, S, R, Q, in which
they continued up to the day the children of Israel stood at the foot of
Mount Sinai, when they became arranged again in their normal order as on
the day that the heavens and the earth were created. This redistribution
of the alphabetical letters

contributed to the permanent welfare and endurance of the world."

Said Rabbi Abba: "When Adam transgressed, the heavens and the earth
trembled and wished to become dissolved into their original elements and
disappear altogether because the covenant between God and man on which
they were founded had become broken, of which it is written, 'If the
covenant of day and night had not existed, I would not have made those
laws that govern and control the universe.' (Jer. xxxiii., 25.) We know
that this covenant was broken by the transgression of Adam as scripture
states, 'but they like Adam have transgressed the covenant' (Hos. vi.,
7). If the Holy One had not foreseen that Israel on arriving at Mount
Sinai would accept the covenant, the very heavens and the earth would
have ceased their existence and reverted back into chaos."

Said Rabbi Hezekiah: "The Holy One remitteth and forgives everyone who
confesses his sins and wrongdoings. Observe that when the world was
created, the Holy One made the covenant upon which it continues to
exist. We infer this from the word Brashith which should be written
thus, bara, shith: meaning 'He created the foundation' or the covenant,
symbolized<span class="margnote">56a</span> by the letter Yod (I) in the
middle of the word shith which though the smallest of the alphabetical
letters, nevertheless represents the covenant through which all
blessings come to mankind. When a son was born unto him, Adam confessed
his sin and was forgiven by the Holy One, and therefore he called his
name Seth, having the same consonantal letters as Shith without the Yod,
symbol of the covenant he had transgressed. Furthermore, the Holy
covenant is also symbolized by the letter Beth (B) which became
incorporated with S and Th when the children of Israel stood at the foot
of Mount Sinai and thus formed the Sabbath (S B Th), of which it is
written, 'Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath (or
covenant) throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant.' It is
a sign between me and the children of Israel forever.'" (Ex. xxxi., 16).

Said Rabbi Jose: "The two letters Shin and Tau were then associated and
from the time the children of Israel received the covenant at Mount
Sinai, they acquired the occult knowledge and understanding of the
mystical meaning of all the letters of the alphabet that, with the
exception of Shin and Tau, had become lost to mankind."

Said Rabbi Jehuda: "From the birth of Seth to the coming

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

of Israel to Mount Sinai, the mysteries of the letters were gradually
unfolded and revealed to the patriarchs, but not fully, as the letters
were not in their normal order as at present."

Said Rabbi Eleazar: "In the days of Enos, men were deeply versed in
occult knowledge and magical science and the manipulation of natural
forces, in which no one was more skilled than he, since the time of Adam
whose chief study was on the occult properties of the leaves of the Tree
of Knowledge of good and evil.<span class="margnote">56a-56b</span> It
was Enos that taught and imparted this occult lore to his
contemporaries, who in their turn handed it down to the antediluvians,
the persistent and perverse opponents of Noah. They boasted that by
their magical science they were able to ward off the divine judgments
threatening them. Whilst Enos lived, men became initiated into the
higher life, as scripture states. 'Then began men to make invocations in
the name of Jehovah.'"

Said Rabbi Isaac: "All the just men who lived subsequent to Enos, as
Jared, Methusalah and Henoch, did all in their power to restrain the
practice of magical arts, but their efforts proved futile and
ineffectual; so that the professors of them, proud of their occult
knowledge, became rebellious and disobedient to their Lord, saying, 'Who
is Shaddai, the almighty, that we should serve him and what profit
should we have in praying unto lam'?' Thus spake they and foolishly
imagined that by their occultism and magic they would he able to nullify
and turn away the oncoming judgment that was to sweep them wholly out of
existence. Beholding their wicked deeds and practices, the Holy One
caused the earth to revert back to its former condition and become
immersed in water. After the deluge, however, He gave the earth again to
mankind, promising, in His mercy, it should never again and in like
manner be destroyed. It is written, 'The Lord caused the earth to be
covered with the deluge' (Ps. xxix., 10). The word for Lord, here, is
Jehovah and not Alhim; the first representing mercy, the other severity
and judgment. In the time of Enos, even young children became students
and trained in the higher mysteries and knowledge of the secret
doctrine."
