<p>It is written, "And the earth was of one language and had the same words" (Gen. XI. 1) and it is further added "And as they, these words, went from the east" (miqqedem). This word here signifies he who is the Alpha or Premier of the world. It is also said, "They found a plain or valley in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there." As soon as they separated themselves from this premier, unity of thought and mind amongst them was no longer possible, and they became dispersed and scattered abroad in all parts of the earth. If in opposition to these remarks, anyone should refer to the words of scripture 'And a river went out of Eden to water the Garden and from thence it was divided and became into four heads,' (Gen. II. 10) in order to show that even in association and close proximity with the Divine Presence, divine separation occur and therefore it was nothing extraordinary that this deflection and revolt from the Premier of the world should take place, just as it was with the river of Eden that it should become parted into four heads. In reply we admit that it was not impossible it should do so after but not before its exit from the garden, so with respect to mankind after the deluge, so long as they remained united together they were attached to the worship of God, the premier of the world. They had one in common, one language, one faith, one mode of worshipping the Divine Being, binding them together in an universal Brotherhood that prevailed amongst them. But declining in divine knowledge and reverence, they gradually veered away from allegiance to their great Premier (miqqedem) until at length they found a plain in the land of Shinar, or in other words, they became ignorant of God their creator and devoid of all knowledge of the higher and diviner life. Scripture relates of Nimrod, 'The beginning of his Kingdom was Babel' from which we gather, it was he who first seduced the postdiluvians from the worship and service of the true god, and introducing confusion and disunion amongst them, he eventually succeeded in usurping rule and sovereignty over them and led them to a plain in the land of Shinar, by which is meant, that from that time men forsook the worship of the Divine and began</p>

It is further related, 'And they said, go to, let us build us a city and a tower whose head may reach into heaven and let us make us a name (shem)' (Gen. XI. 4).</p>
