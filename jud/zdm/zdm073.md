It is written of Nimrod, "And he was a mighty hunter before the Lord'
(Gen. X. 9). He acquired authority and renown by wearing the
primogenital robes and garments of Adam and was able thus to corrupt the
minds and habits of mankind in his days.

Said Rabbi Eleazer: "Nimrod first led men into error and caused them to
fall into idolatry. Having possessed himself of the habiliments of his
ancestor Adam, he usurped rule and authority over his fellows who
submissively yielding to his tyranny made him the object of their
worship and adoration. Why was he called Nimrod? Because he rebelled
 <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) against the Lord, the most high King
of Heaven, and brought about a revolt in both worlds, the celestial and
terrestrial. Becoming regarded as an universal sovereign and succeeding
in wielding; the minds of mankind, he induced then to cease and
discontinue their allegiance to their Lord and creator."

Said Rabbi Simeon: "Initiates of the secret doctrine recognize in the
expression 'Adam's habiliments,' a very deep and occult mystery, the
explanation of which is never divulged or imparted save to advanced
students of the Hidden Wisdom."
