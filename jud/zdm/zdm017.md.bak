### PREVIOUS WORLDS AND RACES.

"These (aleh) are the generations (children or races) of the heavens and
the earth" (Gen. xi., 4). It has been stated that in every passage of
Scripture that the word aleh occurs, there is no connection with what
precedes it. This is the ease with the passage just quoted. Its logical
reference and connection is with the words "tohu," and "bohu" (without
form and void) in the second verse of Gen. i. There are those who say
that the Holy One created worlds and then destroyed them. Why were they
destroyed? Because, as the Scripture says, "the earth was tohu and
bohu," indicating the state of former worlds before

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

their destruction. But would it not have been better if he had<span
class="margnote">24b-25a</span> not created them? Most certainly it
would, and the explanation involves a great mystery. if you ask an
explanation of what and wherefore He destroyed them, our reply is this:
In the first place the Holy One never has destroyed the work of his
hands. The scripture referring to the heavens, states: "The heavens
shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old as a garment,
and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner" (Is. li. 6), from
which it has been inferred that the Holy One creates and destroys worlds
with their inhabitants according to a certain law. The fact is, that the
Holy One created the, world and its population through the law expressed
esoterically in the word "brashith," and referred to in the following
passage:

"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, and before he had
created anything I was with him" (Prov. viii. 22); and by this brashith
(beginning) he created the heavens and the earth, the foundations of
which were based on "berith" (law or covenant), the letters of which are
contained in br(ash)ith. It is of this berith that scripture speaks: "If
the law (or covenant) I have made had not existed, there would have been
no day nor night, heaven nor earth" (Jer. xxxiii. 25), and it is of this
law the Scripture further states: "The heavens are the Lord's," and he
has given the earth to the children of men. (Ps. cxv. 16.) By the earth
the Psalmist means our earth or world, which is one of seven worlds or
earths referred to by David: "I will walk before the Lord in the lands
or earths of the living" (Ps. cxvi. 9). If, therefore, the Lord created
worlds and destroyed them by reducing them to a state of tohu and bohu
before the creation of the heavens and the earth, it was because the
berith or law of such creation was not yet elaborated or existent. This
is why the earth has escaped the fate of previous worlds.

At first God made known this law by the symbolism of circumcision to the
heathen nations of antiquity; but, as they were unwilling to accept it,
the earth remained barren and unfruitful. This is the esoteric meaning
of the words, "Let the waters be gathered into one place" (Gen. i. 8),
signifying the secret doctrine or knowledge of the divine law; "into one
place" designates Israel, whose spiritual derivation is from the place
of which it is said, "Blessed be the glory of the Lord in his place"
(Ez. iii. 12), meaning by "the Glory of the Lord" the lower Shekina, and
"in his place" the Shekina on high. As the souls of Israel are unified
with it, therefore Jehovah is with them and

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

over them, for it is written, "The portion of the Lord is his people"
(Deuter. xxxii. 9). For this reason, the Scripture also saith, "Let the
waters be gathered together in one place";<span
class="margnote">25a</span> that is, Israel who accepted the law, and
"let the dry land or element appear"; that is, the idolatrous nations
who, unwilling to receive it, have remained barren and sterile.

This, then, is the explanation of what has been erroneously said: "God
created worlds and destroyed them" through caprice. It was because of
their rejection of and non-conformity to the law of nature. According to
traditions that have been handed down, they, that is, the early races
and their offspring, were created and called into existence by the
second Divine Form, or hypostasis, symbolized by the letter H, as it is
written "behibaram" (whom he created), a word which the most ancient
teachers maintain ought to be divided and written "behi baram," meaning,
God created them by the he. This is why the letter H in this word (an
anagram of the name Abraham) is found written in the Pentateuch smaller
than the other letters, and implying the barrenness and infertility of
the heathen during the fifth or He millenium after creation, which led
up to the destruction of the first and second temples.

Moses, because he wished to bring these nations to a knowledge of the
Divine, believing they had been created by the Divine Form called He,
was greatly disappointed and grieved when God said to him: "Go, get thee
down, for thy people have sinned" (Ex. xxxii. 7), in that they have
failed in love to H and reverence to V that were due unto them, and have
fallen from that high state of spiritual elevation represented by V, the
letter which proceeds and is derived from the L and H, and descended
from on high along with H in order that not a single soul should be lost
of those who had inhabited previous worlds that had entered into
pralaya, symbolized by the captivity of Israel. The souls of the
Antediluvians (ereb rah) emanated from those to whom Scripture refers.
"For the heavens shall disappear like smoke and the earth wax old as a
garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner" (Is. li.
6). They are also those for whom Noah was unwilling to intercede, and
therefore it is written of them, "And they were destroyed from the
earth" (Gen. vii. 23). They were the same souls of whom it is also
written, "Thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under
heaven" (Deuter. xxv. 19).

Unthinkingly, Moses caused to descent the being called He

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

among these men, and was therefore denied the privilege of<span
class="margnote">25a</span> entering into the Holy Land until He
returned to its former place on high. When He descended from above Vau
came down also. Who shall raise He again on high? It is Vau whose
presence was not with Moses (the word Moses is written without a Vau).
This is why the letter He in "behibaram," an anagram as stated of
Abraham, is written smaller than the other letters in the book of the
law, and to which scripture alludes. "He brought them forth out of
Egypt" by means of the Vau who, at the same time, brought out the He.
When the Vau and He became conjoined, the vow was made. "The hand of God
upon his throne shall be raised against Amalek, the Lord will have war
with Amalek from generation to generation" (Ex. xvii. 16), "yod al cas
Jah milehamah la Jehovah beamalek."

What is the signification of the words, "from generation to generation"?
They allude to the time of Moses. We have been informed by ancient
masters that a generation is in number equivalent to 600,000 souls, and
there exists a tradition that in the time of Moses each woman bore in
her womb potentially the same number of embryos.

After the deluge the souls of the antediluvians incarnated in five
different races or nations, viz., the Nephilim (fallen or degraded),
Giborim (mighty ones), Anakim (tall ones), Rephaim (the giants), and
Amalekim (Amalekites). It was through the last of these that He fell
from on high. Balaam and Balak were descendants of Amalek. Take Ain and
Mim (a and m) from the former, L and K from the latter, and the
remaining letters form the word Babel, and the subtracted letters the
name Amalek. It is of them that Scripture refers, "therefore is the name
of it called Babel because the Lord did there confound (babel) the
language of the earth" (Gen. xl. 9). And they were they who survived the
catastrophe of the deluge of whom it is said: "He destroyed every living
thing on the face of the earth" (Gen. vii. 23).

These five races survived till the time of the fourth captivity of
Israel, whose chief enemies they were, and therefore called instruments
of iniquity. They are denoted in Scripture by the words, "And the earth
also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence"
(Gen. vi. 11). Of these, the first race was the Amalekites. Of the
Nephilim it is recorded, "And the sons of God beheld the daughters of
men that they were fair" (Gen. vi. 2). They were also the second in rank
of the angel hosts that were cast out of heaven and became incarnated.
