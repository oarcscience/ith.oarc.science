### RABBI ELEAZAR AND RABBI HEZEKIAH, AND THEIR NOCTURNAL STUDIES.

Rabbi Eleazar was once staying at a wayside inn in [Lud](errata.htm#73.md),
where he met with Rabbi Hezekiah. At midnight, as was his custom, he
arose to meditate on the Secret Doctrine. His fellow student did the
same.

Said Rabbi Eleazar: "An inn affords good opportunities to students for
meeting together. It is written, 'As the apple tree amongst the trees of
the forest, so is my beloved among the children of men. I sat me down
under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste'
(Cant. II. 3). The esoteric meaning of these words is this: The apple
tree that is distinguished by its color from all other trees in the
woods refers to the Holy One, the most desired of all beings. Therefore
it is said, 'I sat me down under his shadow,' that is, under the divine
and not of any other inferior celestial ruler. 'His shadow,' since when?
From the time that Abraham appeared in the world, of whom it is written,
'Abraham my friend' (Is. XL. 8).<span class="margnote">Is. 41:8</span>
The words, 'and his fruit was sweet to my taste,' refer to Isaac, who
was holy fruit. Another interpretation of 'I sat me down under his
shadow with great delight' is that they refer to Jacob, as it is
written, 'These are the children of Jacob,' whilst 'his fruit was sweet
to my taste' denote Joseph, whose children were the quintessence of the
descendants of Jacob, and because of this were called by the name of
Ephraim,

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

as it is stated, 'Ephraim my dear son' (Jer. XXXI. 20). Also<span
class="margnote">85-85b</span> Abraham may be likened unto the apple
tree among the trees of the wood, for his pure life was as a sweet
perfume. By his faith and obedience to the Holy One he far excelled
others both in the world on high as those in the world below, and thus
became distinguished as Abraham the Unique, to whom no man that has ever
rested in the world is to be compared."

Said Rabbi Hezekiah: "Do not the words, 'The souls that they had gotten
in Haran,' indicate that they were individuals who had attained the true
faith, the same as Abraham?"

Said Rabbi Eleazar: "They certainly refer to those who were converts to.
Abraham's faith, yet they never attained unto his excellency in the
divine life."

Rabbi Eleazar here for some moments remained silent, and then said: "It
has just been said unto me that Abraham was not termed 'Unique' until
after the birth of Isaac and Jacob, when all these three patriarchs
became conjoined and regarded as the fathers of the faithful."

Said Rabbi Hezekiah: "What has been said unto you is perfectly true.
Whilst the 'apple tree among the trees of the wood,' and also 'my
beloved among the children of men,' together with 'under his shadow,'
all refer to the Holy One; the words 'I sat me down with great delight'
signify the time when the Divine Presence was manifested on Mount Sinai
and Israel received the Secret Doctrine and said, 'All that the Lord
hath said, we will do and obey' (Ex. XXIV. 7). 'And his fruit was sweet
to my taste' signify the Secret Doctrine, as it is written, 'Sweeter
than honey and the honeycomb' (Ps. XIX. 11). Another interpretation has
reference to the souls of the righteous, who are all the fruit of the
works of the Holy One and dwell with him on high. Observe that all souls
in the world are the fruit of his work before they become incarnated,
and form one grand aggregate which, after descending into the earth
life, become separated and differentiated into male and female forms
that eventually become united. Observe that the desire of the female
towards the male induces in it a similar and corresponding feeling
resulting in marriage. This reunion is brought about and accomplished by
the Holy One alone, and not by any celestial chief or ruler. Blessed is
the man whose life is pure and who walks in the path of truth, for their

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

soul becomes united with soul as they existed before incarnation. He
whose life is a pure and spiritual life is the perfect man, of whom it
is written, 'His fruit is sweet to my taste.' or he is not only blessed
himself, but is a blessing to the world and we are able to conclude,
therefore, that weal or woe, happiness or unhappiness, are the results
of our own acts, words and deeds."

Said Rabbi Hezekiah to Rabbi Eleazar: "Listen<span
class="margnote">85b-86a</span> to what has been said to me. It is
written, 'From me is thy fruit found' (Hes. XIV. 8).<span
class="margnote">Hosea 14:8</span> This is what the Holy One said to the
congregation of Israel, 'thy fruit,' and not 'my fruit,' meaning that as
through the united desires of the male and female fruit is born, or a
soul is born, so it is with the union of the congregation of Israel with
the Holy One. They become united to them by the tie of holy and pure
love resulting in holy fruit, as marriage does in the production of
offspring."
