### "SYMBOLISM OF THE COLORS OF THE BOW IN THE CLOUD."

Said Rabbi Eleazar: The three primal colors become differentiated into
many shades and hues and, as such, are symbols of the divine life and
its numerous descending grades of holiness that merge and blend
imperceptibly into the evil, just as the animal glides into the
vegetable rendering it difficult and almost impossible to distinguish
where the one ends and the other begins. The colors of the rainbow have
each of them twenty-seven<span class="margnote">73b</span> different
shades and similarly the principle of holiness has the same number of
descending gradations until it disappears into that which is unholy and
sinful, [indiscernible](errata.htm#48.md) to the ordinary observer, but
clearly perceived and distinctly cognized by those who have become
recipients of divine wisdom. Blessed is the lot of the upright in heart,
to whom the Holy One delights to impart it and entrust to them its
secret teachings. It is of them the psalmist speaks, 'The secret of the
Lord is with them that fear him and he will shew them his covenant' (Is.
XXV. 1). Greatly obligatory upon everyone is it to meditate upon the
glory of his creator, who hears and attends to the prayers of all such
as worship and serve him in sincerity of heart, for then blessings are
showered upon them from on high with increasing knowledge of the Holy
One who glories in his servants, of whom it is written, 'Thou art my
servant, oh Israel in whom I will he glorified.'" (Is. XLIX. 3).
