### "THE TOWER OF BABEL."

Said Rabbi Hiya: It is written, 'The wicked are like the troubled sea'
(nigrash) (Is. LVII. 20). Is there then a troubled sea? Truly so, for
when it exceedeth its boundaries, it becomes 'nigrash' and bursting its
barriers, as a man intoxicated with wine, rolling and staggering and
unable to keep himself erect, and scripture further adds, of the sea
when in this troubled state, 'It cannot rest; and its waters cast up
mire and dirt,' meaning that whilst it is calm, the mud concealed in its
depths remains undisturbed but the moment its surface begins to be
ruffled and agitated by tempestuous winds and storms it is ejected,
similarly with a man who as long as he is devoted to the service of his
Lord, his lower nature or self is calla and peaceful, its animal
propensities repressed and restrained, but as soon as his relation with
his divine higher self becomes disturbed and broken, like a drunkard, he
begins to reel and stagger, and give utterance to the depraved feelings
and emotions that have lain dormant within him, and in proportion as he
babbles forth his obscure and filthy gibberish, so does his profanity
increase, for it is the reflection of his impure animal self that then
becomes manifested. Observe the words, 'And they said, go to, let us
build us a city and tower whose top shall reach into heaven.' The term
"*habah*" (go to) whenever used in scripture is always found in
connection with some thing or project unrealizable by those who
conceived it. Their blind impulse to build such a city and tower arose
only from a wicked and foolish desire that animated and prompted them to
live in open revolt against the Holy One."

Said Rabbi Abba: "They were the subjects of a horrible and demoniacal
infatuation in that they impiously wished to abandon the worship of
their Lord for that of Satan or the serpent to whom they rendered homage
and glory. The words, 'go to, let us build us a city and tower,' have a
deeply occult meaning

and contain a mystery most profound. Remark that when the Postdiluvians
arrived at the plain in the land of Shinar (a strange kingdom or domain)
and had become acquainted with and accommodated themselves to its
natural advantages coming from its proximity to the sea, they said
amongst themselves, it will be best for us to settle down and dwell
here, for with little trouble and at once we can indulge in those
sensual pleasures and delights that are the charm of life, making it
worth the living. But why worship heavenward and what advantage will
accrue to us in so doing. Here let us build us a temple and make a deity
of ourselves. Come and let us make a shem (name, a synonym for God, or a
Divine Being) whom we can adore and have him always in our midst as a
center of attraction, and thus avoid becoming dispersed abroad on the
face of the earth."
