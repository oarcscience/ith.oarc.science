### RABBI SIMEON ON THE CLOSING OF THE SANCTUARY.

Said Rabbi Simeon: "We read, thus saith the Lord God. The gate of the
inner court that looketh toward the east, (quadim), shall be shut the
six working days, but on the Sabbath, it shall be opened and on the day
of the new moon it shall be opened' (Ez. XLVI. 1.). These words have a
hidden meaning which should be made known, in order to comprehend and
better understand the true signification of what has formed the subject
of our discussion. In the first place, let us inquire why it was
enjoined that the sanctuary should be closed during the six working days
and opened only the Sabbath and the first of the month? It was in order
to guard against the entry of the profane, so that they might not abuse
what was sacred and holy, and therefore the gate of the sanctuary was
opened only on the Sabbath and the day of the new moon when its light
became blended with that of the sun. Observe that during the six working
days, the lower world seeks to obtain and draw nourishment from the
higher world. It is also during these days that the accuser or spirit of
evil, save in the land of Israel, is rampant in the world. At the time
of the sabbath and new moon, he is compelled to withdraw his presence
and recede into his own dark realm as long as the gate of the sanctuary
remains open. Then is it the world rejoices on being freed from the
power and influence of the evil one. If it be asked: Is he the only one
that rules and operates during the week days? we reply, that before the
elementals begin their work in the world, the Holy One beholds and looks
down upon it, but only during the sabbath and the time of new moon does
he provide for its sustenance that comes through the sanctuary, all of
whose gates are then opened and peace prevails in both worlds. Remark
that it

is said, 'and the Lord came down to see (liroth) the city. . . .'<span

glory, he manifested himself in a visible form in order that, after
viewing the city and tower they were building, he might confound their
audacious plans and disperse them throughout the world."
