### THE KING'S PALACES.

THE word sin refers to Samuel, who is the serpent; <span
class="margnote">23b</span> destroys means the destroying angel, his
anger, the Holy One who wishes not that these angels should seize hold
of our prayers. The destroying angels are under the control of seven
chiefs, each having seventy others subject to his orders and authority.
These are always ready to seize a man's prayer as it proceeds from his
lips, and there are myriads of them. When a man with fringed garment and
phylacteries girded upon his head and arm, uttereth a sincere prayer,
scripture saith: "And all the people of the earth shall see, thou
bearest the name of Jehovah and shall be afraid of thee" (Deuter xxviii.
10). As we have before stated, the name of Jehovah is contained in the
phylactery on the head of every suppliant, and when thus seen these
destroying angels fly quickly away as it is written: "A thousand shall
fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand" (Ps. xci. 7). When
Jacob by divine clairvoyance saw the afflictions and the captivity his
descendants would endure and suffer in the later days, it is said that
he was greatly afraid and distressed (Gen. xxxii. 7). This was why he
divided the people into three companies, as it is written: "And he
divided the children unto Leah and unto Rachel and unto the two
handmaids, and he put the handmaids and their children foremost, Leah
and

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

her children in the middle and Rachel and Joseph hindmost" (Gen. xxxiii.
1, 2). By these three companies or divisions were prefigured the three
captivities: the handmaids and their children referring to the captivity
of Edom or Egypt, Leah and her children, and Rachel with Joseph, to the
other two captivities.

Foreseeing the anguish and misery that would be endured by his
descendants in the future, this is why he prayed and vowed, saying, "If
God will be with me, and will keep me in the way that I go, and will
give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that I come again to my
father's house in peace, then shall the Lord be my Adonai (Gen. xxviii.
20-21). David also alluded to the captivity of the Schekina, foreseeing
the children of Israel returning with joy to their fatherland and in the
exuberance of his joy, composed ten different songs, the last of which
is entitled "A Prayer of the afflicted one, when overwhelmed, he poureth
out his complaint before the Lord" (Ps. cii.). The prayer of the poor
and suffering has precedence with the Holy One and is regarded before
the prayer of all others. And what is the Poor man's prayer? It is the
evening prayer which he is privileged to utter when by himself and
alone. The upright poor man is the descendant of Jacob under the power
of other nations, and resembles the evening prayer in that he is in the
night of captivity. The prayer of the Sabbath day is a charity or good
deed done to the poor, and is as the rising sun that beams upon
everything and is a benefit to all. For this reason a man should regard
himself as a mendicant at the King's gate or door, as humility of heart
and mind should be the chief feature in praying during the week days
especially when, girded with the phylacteries, a man stands as a
suppliant and mendicant before the palace gates of Adonai, the Great
King, and prays: "Open my lips, Oh Adonai, and my mouth shall show forth
thy praise" (Ps. li. 17). During week days, an angel like an eagle
descends as soon as the evening prayer begins and taking it between his
wings ascends and presents it then to the Holy One.

This ministering angel is called Ouriel (light of God) when the prayer
is an act of piety and love, and Nouriel (fire of God) when it proceeds
from earnestness of heart and feeling which is as a fiery glow coming
forth from the soul within, as it is written: "A fiery stream issued and
came forth"<span class="margnote">23b</span> (Dan. vii. 9). During
morning prayer, the ministering angel who descends is in form like a
lion, and after taking it, ascends again heavenward. During vespers, or
evening prayer, the ministering angel is in

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

form of an ox and under the rulership of Gabriel.<span
class="margnote">23b-24a</span> On the Sabbath day the Holy One descends
Himself from heaven accompanied by the patriarchs, in order to welcome
his only daughter. This is the mystery and occult meaning of the word
Sabbath, She-Bath, the signification of which is, for she is his only
child.

When the Sabbath dawns, the Holy One descends from his throne of glory
to greet its coming, and myriads of angelic beings assemble and sing
their hymn of praise and adoration: "Lift up your heads, oh ye gates,
and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shall come
in."

Who is the King of Glory! The Lord, strong and mighty; the Lord mighty
in battle. Lift up your heads and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting door,
and the King of glory shall come in. Who is the King of Glory? The Lord
of Hosts! He is the King of Glory. (Ps. xxiv. 9.) Then are opened the
gates of the seven palaces, the first of which is the palace of love,
the second of reverence, the third of mercy, the fourth of the luminous
mirror, the fifth of the non-luminous mirror, the sixth of justice, the
seventh of judgment. These palaces are alluded to in the words Brashith
bra Alhim. (Gen. 1. i.) Brashith divided into Bra-shith signifies He
created six, viz., the six palaces, and Alhim along with them forms the
seventh. Corresponding to them are also seven palaces here below on the
earth plane, an allusion to which is made in the psalm beginning with
the words, "Give unto the Lord, oh ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory
and strength." (Ps. xxix. 1.) In this psalm the words, "the voice of the
Lord," are found repeated seven times, as also the divine name Jehovah
eighteen times, corresponding to the number of worlds that the Holy One
visits, as described in Psalm lxviii. 18. The chariot of God, viz., the
divine form in which He manifests his glory, is surrounded by tens of
thousands and myriads of angels, and in this form of manifestation He
visits the eighteen systems of worlds in the universe. The gates of the
palace whither prayers ascend are strongly guarded, but they find no
entrance unless sincere and the result of meditation, whilst the palace
of the Shekina or Divine Presence is always open, and it is of prayers
sent up to it that the Psalmist refers. "They shall not be ashamed, but
they shall speak with the enemies at the gate" (Ps. cxxvii. 5), that is,
the King's gate, or gate of the Divine Shekina, to whom all prayers from
our Higher Self, or the divine within us, should be addressed direct and
without any

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

intermediary; because what cometh from the divine, unto the divine
returneth, like the Scripture with all its positive and negative
commandments<span class="margnote">24a</span> and precepts which came
direct from the name of Jehovah, as it is written: "This is my name for
ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations." (Ex. iii. 15.) The
word shemi (my name), augmented with the two first letters yod and he (I
and H) of the divine name has the numerical value of 365, equal to the
number of negative precepts or prohibitions of the law. Also the word
zicri (my memorial). augmented with i the two last letters of the same
name, vau and he (V and I1), in its numerical value represents the 245
positive precepts or commandments of scripture. It is for this reason
that the liturgy of the Shema, containing 248 words, is repeated before
the benediction, "Blessed be thou, Oh Lord, who hast chosen thy people
Israel in love."
