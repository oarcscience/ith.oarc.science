### "RABBI SIMEON'S REFLECTIONS ON THE SUPREME AND ITS UNION WITH HUMAN SOULS."

Said Rabbi Simeon, during prayer, I raise my hands on high as a token
and expression of the gratitude of my will nature that goeth up to the
almighty supreme Being whose essence is Will infinite and beyond all
human comprehension. He is the great Beginning, the mystery of all
mysteries. All created things in the universe are but emanations from
Him who is the height of height that neither man nor angel can approach
unto, nor hath ever seen or can see its origin and source. In vain the
mind of man attempts to fly towards the omnipotent Will Being of which
it is a fraction infinitesimal and infinitely small. Vain are all
efforts to grasp and comprehend Thought Supreme and eternal, as we sink
confounded, overwhelmed with feelings of awe ineffable. Yet though the
height Divine remains eternally invisible to human vision, it manifests
its presence and operates within the minutes and hours chiefly within
the soul of man with whose natural light it blends whenever its
aspirations and thoughts tend towards and are centered on the great
source of all being and creation, the primal light that enlighteneth
every man that cometh into the world. Between the enlightened human soul
and the great Beginning are nine palaces or grades of evolutionary
development two Kabbalah are designated Sephiroth whose culmination is
Kether or The Crown. These grades, palaces or sephiroth call them as we
may, are not entities but modes or stages of ascent towards union with
the Divine Will and their respective lights are but the luminous
reflection of the Divine Thought. Though nine in number, they are really
one in this sense, they are derivations of the great Thought without
which they could not exist and can never be but imperfect and obscure
representations of the Divine Entity that must remain always unknown in
its sublimity and transcendency beyond all human comprehension. Through
these palaces the enlightened soul enters by continuous aspirations and
thus they become the intermediaries to it between the known and unknown,
between the comprehensible and the incomprehensible. Within them are
hidden all the great spiritual mysteries and realities that to humanity

as at present must remain objects of faith rather than of reason<span

enlightened soul can they become cognised in its gradual ascension
through them on its way to the great and transcendent Being termed The
Eternal, The Everlasting One. But this cannot be effected only as it
becomes receptive of and imbued with the light and splendor of the
Sephiroth Binah (Doctrine Intelligence) by which it is brought into
union with the Divine and enters into the enjoyment of the Beatific
Vision. From these observations we are better able to understand and
penetrate into the meaning and mysteries of sacrifices in general which
as mere rites and ceremonies have no intrinsic efficacy. Only when they
are the expression of the soul, gradually becoming purified and
enlightened by and through its higher self are they a means of spiritual
ascension in the divine life which is the true light of mankind
assimilating and bringing it into closer relationship with the divine,
Eternal I Am in whose presence there is fulness of joy and at whose
right hand there are pleasures forevermore.
