### "KABBALISTIC EXPLANATION OF THE GOAT AZAZEL."

Rabbi Eleazar whilst sitting in presence of his father Rabbi Simeon,
spake and said, "the demon called 'the end of all flesh' doth it take
pleasure and receive any advantage from the sacrifices of Israel or
not?"

Whereupon Rabbi Simeon replied "Yea truly, both heaven above and earth
below are benefited. Observe that priests (cohanim) Levites and Israel
are collectively termed Adam when imbued with the same holy will and
desire to, offer up a sacrifice either of a sheep, an ox or any other
animal. Before so doing,<span class="margnote">64b-65a</span> however,
they must make confession and expiate their sins of word, though and
deed, for then only are sacrifices of any avail and become charged with
the sins confessed as was the case with the Azazel or scapegoat driven
forth into the wilderness bearing the sins of the congregation of
Israel, as it is written--'and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the
head of the goat and confess over it all the iniquities of the children
of Israel and all their transgressions, putting them upon the head of
the goat and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into the
wilderness.'" (Lev. XVI. 21). It is the same with other sacrifices. When
placed upon the altar they become charged with the good deeds and
thoughts, as also of the sins and evil thoughts of the sacrificer, each
of them ascending to its own appropriate place on high and distinguished
as emanations from a man's higher self and denominated Adam or from his
animal or lower nature and called "behemoth" (beastly). This distinction
is referred to in scripture, "Thou savest both man (adam) and beast."
(Ps. XXXVI. 6). Offerings of unleavened cakes and all other comestibles,
are for attracting the Holy Spirit and inducing it to operate through
the service of the priest, the chanting of Levites and the prayers of
the worshippers. In the oil and wheat of such offerings, none of the
expeditive angels of retribution can participate so that they are unable
to acid to the severity of their afflicting judgments, being attracted
for the time being by the offerings of animals. This is why sacrifices
of both kinds take place at one and the same time, in accordance with
the injunctions of the Secret

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Doctrine that
gratitude and thankfulness the true elements of<span

high pure and sincere before the Almighty and thus obtain responsive
blessings.
