### "A KABBALISTIC SYMPOSIUM BY RABBI SIMEON'S STUDENTS."

RABBI ELEAZAR spake and said: "It is written 'the voice of the Lord is
upon the waters.<span class="margnote">31a</span> The God of glory
thundereth, the Lord is upon mighty waters' (Ps. xxlx. 3). These words
allude to the celestial river whose life-giving waters circulate and
flow throughout the world and give life and strength to every creature
that breathes and moves upon the face of the earth. 'The God of glory
thundereth' signifies the sephiroth *Geburah* (power) as expressed in
the words, 'but the thunder of his power (Geburah), who can understand?'
(Job [xxvi](errata.htm#14). 14.md). This awful power it is that proceeds
from the left side of the sephirotic tree, by and through the God of
glory that is on the right side. 'The Lord is upon mighty waters'
alludes to the sephiroth *Hochma* (heavenly wisdom) described as God
upon mighty waters, that is upon the secret place from which they flow
forth, as it is written, 'Thy paths are on the mighty waters'" (Ps.
lxxvii '19).

After this brief interlocution, Rabbi Simeon resumed his discourse find
said: "It is written, Over against the border, shall the rings be for
the places of the staves to bear the table' (Ex. xxv. 27). What is the
esoteric meaning of the word 'border'

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (misghereth)? It
refers to the secret place in the tabernacle kept continually closed to
everyone except to him whose duty it was to enter therein and light the
lamps. It was therefore called the 'closed place' and symbolized the
world to come or the hidden and unseen world. The rings here mentioned,
of which there were three linked one with the other, signify the sacred
chain of the three elements, water, air and fire. The water proceeds
from the air, the air from the fire and fire from the water. Thus these
elements, though apparently different, are radically the same. 'Places
of the staves' denote the modal combinations which these elements assume
in the various types of things and creatures existent in the universe,
the *modus operandi*, of which, Nature's great secret, is not imparted
to a worldly minded man to fathom or understand. He remains ever in the
outer court and is never permitted to enter her adytum and view the
mysteries of the inner temple or Holy of Holies, inasmuch as the sight
only of them would prove fatal to him. And this is why it is written
'the stranger that cometh nigh, shall be put to death'" (Num. i. 51).

"The letter B in the word Brashith is written larger than any other
letter in the Pentateuch. What is the reason of this?" asked Rabbi Jose,
"and what is the esoteric explanation<span
class="margnote">31a-31b</span> of the six days of creation which has
been handed down by preceding adepts and teachers?"

Replying to these questions, Rabbi Simeon said: "As in Scripture is
found the expression 'The cedars of Lebanon,' distinguishing them from
all other cedars, so the six days of creation are separated and
characterized especially as the days of *Brashith* (creation). With
reference to these important days the Scripture thus refers to them:
Thine Oh Lord is the greatness (gedulah), the power (geburah), and the
victory (netzach), for all things in heaven and earth are thine. Thine
is the kingdom (malcuth) and thou art exalted as head above all" (1 Ch.
xxlx. 11). The word "All" in this verse signifies the just or the good
law which prevails throughout the universe. The targum paraphrases these
words thus: "The All (or the good law) binds together heaven and earth.
It is the basis on which the universe is built. In heaven it is
symbolized by the sephira Tiphereth (harmony or beauty) and in the world
by the children or sons of light. This is the reason why the Scripture
begins with the letter B (the numerical value of which is two) in the
word Brashith, B---'two,' rashith--'beginning,' that is to say,

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

by the second 'beginning,' or, in other words, by hochma (wisdom), the
second in the first sephirotic triad, and which is the signification
given by the targum of Jonathan Ben Uzziel to this word. Brashith, for
though hochma is placed second in the manifestation of Ain Soph (the
boundless One), it is in essence one and the same with Kether (the
crown), the supernal or higher sephira.<span class="margnote">31b</span>
The signification then of the initial words of Scripture, Brashith bra,
Alhim (translated in the English version, 'In the beginning God
created'), is this: By hochma (wisdom), the second manifestation of the
Divine, or, in other words, the Creative Logos or Alhim created the
heavens and the earth. From it proceeded the light which enters as a
principle of life into every living existent thing and creature, as it
is written, 'A river went forth out of Eden to water the garden,' that
is, to prepare and qualify the earth for the production, growth and
development of animated existences. By the word Alhim is signified the
ever-living eternal Alhim.

"Now the words 'bra Alhim' created Alhim seem to indicate that Brashith,
the supreme Alhim or Logos, created the lower Alhim. And this is true,
for, owing to the celestial river from which all life has flowed into
the universe, the first and the third sephiroth, viz.: Kether (crown)
and Binah (understanding) in an ineffable manner, becoming united, gave
rise or origin to the lower Alhim, who created the world and was thus
the proximate source of all life necessary for its subsistence and
endurance. To this Alhim was entrusted all power, both in heaven and
earth, after they had been called into existence. The words
'athhashamayim' (the heavens) indicate that it was only after the
ever-living and eternal Alhim had manifested as *hochma* the creative
Logos that the third manifestation or Logos descended from on high upon
the earth. Then it was that the three supreme Logoi became blended and
unified in the work of creation, and then was it also that the sacred
chain of three rings became complete and the resplendent light was
manifested on creation as intimated in the words 'Brashith bra Alhim,
ath hashamayim vatha aretz.' In the beginning God designed the world. By
the second 'beginning' (hochma), wisdom, He formed it, and by the third
'beginning' (Binah), understanding, He manifested it and caused the
light to descend from on high upon the world below. I now understand and
grasp the esoteric meaning of the strange enigmatical words, 'Shall the
axe magnify itself against him that heweth therewith' (Is. x. 15). It is
to the hewer and not to

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

the axe that honor must be ascribed, so to the first and supreme Logos
who created the world by the other Alhim, or Logoi, should and ought to
be attributed honor and glory."

Said Rabbi Jose: "This is the interpretation of the mystical words,
'What nation is there so great that hath God so nigh unto them as our
Jehovah Alhim' (Lord of the Alhim) (Deuter. iv. 7), alluding to the
supreme and other Alhim, or Logoi, who were the *Pachad* whom Isaac the
patriarch worshipped and which, though differing in their
manifestations, were one and the same in essence. The allocution of the
words Brashith to the ten sephiroth is as follows: *Brashith bra* refer
to Kether (crown), and Hochma (wisdom), *Alhim* to Binah, *ath* to
gedulah and geburah, *hashamayim* to Tiphereth, *vath* to Netzach, Hod
and Yesod and *ha-aretz* to malcuth.
