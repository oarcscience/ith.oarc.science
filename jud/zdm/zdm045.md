SAID Rabbi Jose. "If all this is true, why were they so exceedingly
foolish and blind that notwithstanding all their occult science they
could not foresee the flood which the Holy One was preparing for their
destruction?"

Said Rabbi Isaac: "They knew full well what was about to take place, but
in the perversity of their hearts they said: 'We know the angels
presiding over the fire and over the water and, by our magical science,
will be able to restrain and prevent them from injuring us.' But alas!
they were ignorant that the Holy One ruled in the world, that from him
cometh judgment and retribution, angels being the executors of his
decrees. This they knew not until the day that the deluge appeared, even
though the Holy Spirit had preached unto them that 'sinners shall be
consumed from off the earth and the wicked shall be no more' (Ps. civ.,
35). The Holy One was forbearing and long-suffering towards them during
the lives of the just men, Jared, Methusalah and Henoch. After their
decease, then judgment quickly overtook these antediluvians and they
were cut off in their sins and wrong-doing, as it is written, 'They were
destroyed from the earth.'" (Gen. vii., 23.)
