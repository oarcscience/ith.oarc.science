# ASHMEDAI, THE KING OF DEMONS

AFTER King Solomon had ascended his father's throne, he called all his
counsellors together one day and addressed them as follows: 'As the wise
and distinguished men of the people, you cannot but recognize that the
time has now come when I have to discharge a deferred debt, which has
been left to me as a legacy by my illustrious father, King David. It is
the building of a Temple to the glory and worship of the Most High God,
which would gladly have been undertaken by my father were it not for the
message he received through Nathan the Prophet, that it was not to be he
himself but his son and successor who should undertake the work.

'I now desire to discharge that holy duty and to erect a structure
worthy of its exalted purpose, and consecrate it to Almighty God. The
condition of things is propitious; peace rules supreme, there is no lack
of ways and means, and Hiram of Tyre has, in fact, already received
instructions to fell cedars in Labonon, and marble and stone is also
ready in abundance. But it requires your wise counsel to enable the
building to proceed without the use of any iron. It would not be proper
to employ an element of destruction in the erection of a structure which
is to be dedicated to peace and harmony.' At the end of the king's
speech, the members of the Court looked at one another in perplexity for
a while; then they began:--

'Wise King and Ruler! Moses, our teacher of blessed memory, found
himself in similar perplexity when he

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

wanted to engrave the names on the Ephod, but the Spirit of God
enlightened him, and he soon found the marvellous worm called "Shomir,"
which possesses the wonderful power of cutting the hardest object known
by a touch. If, O Glorious King! you succeed in obtaining that wonderful
insect, you will have no need of iron or any element of destruction in
the erection of the house which you wish to consecrate to the Most High
God, and dedicate as the emblem of peace and harmony.

The king's countenance brightened at this information, and, lifting up
his eyes heavenwards, he said, 'Verily, O God of Israel, thou hast
granted wisdom and knowledge to my people Israel! You, my friends, have
given me new life and fresh spirit. Now, can you tell me where the
wonderful insect is to be found, so that I may have it brought and may
utilize its power?' 'That, mighty ruler,' replied the wise men, 'is
beyond our ken, and we doubt whether it is within the knowledge of any
mortal man. It is supposed that the "Shomir" has its home in wild and
desolate places which have never been traversed by human foot. We are
therefore not able to comply with your wish, but if you have the advice
of a male and female demon who traverse those wastes, we doubt not that
they will be able to throw more light on this dark mystery.'

Solomon then sent to Sichon, the rendezvous of demons, had a male and
female demon brought before him, and addressed them as follows: 'It is
said of you that you have a knowledge of mysteries which we do not
possess. Tell me, therefore, where I could obtain that wonderful insect
known as "Shomir"?'

They replied, 'We are aware of the existence of the marvellous "Shomir,"
but are unable to give anything like a near description of its abode;
that is only known to our king and great master, Ashmedai. He alone
would be able to gratify your wish.' 'And,' said

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

Solomon, 'where is the abode of your king and great master? 'His home,'
was the answer, 'is on a high mountain, far, very far, from Jerusalem,
in a lovely and beautiful spot. There he has a well filled with cold
clear water, covered with a wooden slab, sealed with his seal. Every day
he leaves his terrestrial abode and flies heavenwards to hear the songs
of the angels, who sing praises to the Great God.

'Being refreshed with the heavenly hymns, he searches through the
heavens, and casts his eyes on the various spheres within his view, and
towards evening he returns to his abode. Arriving there, he looks
carefully at the seal of his well to see that it has not been tampered
with, and, finding it all right, he lifts the slab and refreshes himself
with the cooling and refreshing liquid.

'More than this, O mighty king, we are not permitted to impart to you
concerning our king and master.' For a long time King Solomon allowed
his eyes to wander about his great room, and at last fixed them on a
youth amongst the assembly--a youth of powerful frame and lovely
appearance, and with an expression of the most resolute and keenest
spirit in his countenance.

'Benaihu, son of Jehoiada,' exclaimed the king, 'long have I known you
as the most courageous in all my legions! See now what a magnificent
opportunity there is offered to you to prove the truth of the opinion I
have formed of you. Will you venture to bring Ashmedai as a captive to
me, and by such heroic deed not only to make yourself a hero amongst
your people, but to do a great service to the holy cause of your
religion?' 'I will venture,' cried the youth, 'any task your majesty may
honour me with,' his eyes shining brightly with delight. 'God be with
you,' said the king; 'He knows that we do all this to glorify His name;
may He guide you and bless your undertaking.' Benaihu left the assembly,
and at his orders a chain

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

was given to him upon every link of which was engraved the unspeakable
name of God in the Chaldean language. He also ordered for his journey a
large quantity of lambs' wool, spades and shovels, and a pipe of the
most exquisite wine of the vines of 'Bal Hamon,' a famous vineyard, the
property of King Solomon.

Thus equipped, Benaihu started with a few followers on the perilous
expedition. After a long and adventurous journey through the desert, he
reached the lovely spot on the mountain which was the home of Ashmedai.
On the top of the mountain grew a cluster of lovely palms, on which an
eternal summer seemed to rest. At its foot ran a clear brook, teeming
with fish of all sorts; on the slope of the mountain could be seen the
well of the great Ashmedai, as described by the two demons.

Benaihu mused a long while, then he said to his followers: 'My friends,
we have now reached our destination, but not our aim. Now let us bear in
mind that muscular power is now of no use to us when we have to deal
with the master of demons, but God has granted us discernment and
understanding, and with these divine gifts it should not be impossible
to prevail over the mighty king of the demons. If only we contrive to
empty his well of the water and fill it with the wine we have brought
with us, then our task is an easy one; but to effect this is a
formidable difficulty, because we must not lift the slab and break the
seal, or we defeat our purpose.'

He then commenced, during Ashmedai's absence, to dig a pit under the
well, and connected the two by boring a small tunnel, so that the water
from Ashmedai's well ran into the newly made pit, then stopped up the
small tunnel completely with the lamb's wool; then a similar pit was dug
above the well, and also connected with Ashmedai's well. The wine was
poured in here, and found its way into the well. After this he had

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

every possible trace of the fresh digging removed, and ordered his
companions to go away from the place, but he climbed up one of the many
palm trees, and sat there to watch events. When the shadows of the
evening lengthened there was a fiery flush through the skies, and there
came with it a monstrous creature with black wings, which gradually let
itself down to the earth.

Ashmedai, for he it was, looked long on the seal of the well, and
finding it untouched, broke it, lifted up the slab, and was about to
refresh himself with the contents of the well. When he detected that it
contained wine instead of the refreshing liquid which he had husbanded,
he turned in disgust from it, exclaiming, 'Wine is a mocker, and every
intoxicant confuses the senses. No! your flattering sweetness shall not
lead me astray; as well would I suffer the tortures of unquenched thirst
as have your exquisite taste upon my palate.' But after a while Ashmedai
could not any longer withstand his craving for some liquid, if only to
moisten his lips, and he said to himself, 'If I only sip at the accursed
stuff it will have no power over me. I will touch of it no more than is
sufficient to moisten my burning tongue.' He drank at first very
sparingly, but it was very, very sweet, and it seemed to give him a
brightness and freshness he had never experienced before. 'Only a
little, a very little more,' he said, ( not sufficient to overmaster
me.' But this very little was followed by few more 'very littles,' till
he became quite intoxicated, and fell asleep. This was quite
satisfactory to the concealed young hero, who, climbing down from his
biding place, went cautiously forward until he reached the sleeping
demon, over whose neck he threw the chain with the name of God engraved
on every link.

Ashmedai slept till the early hours of the morning, when he found
himself heavily fettered, scarcely able

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

to firm round on his bed. He looked for heavy manacles, but found only a
fragile chain round his neck, which he could not credit with such
immense power. He tried his utmost to snap the frail thing, but without
success.

He roared terribly, so that the very air was filled with the violent
noise. 'O set me free; who will set me free from this hellish burden?'
'No one,' came the answer from the hitherto hidden Benaihu; 'all your
efforts are fruitless; you are fettered, not indeed with iron manacles,
only with a chain of softer metals, but that has the name of God
engraved on it, and in the name of God you are my captive.' Ashmedai, on
hearing Benaihu's words, became quiet and resigned to his situation. One
of Benaihu's men was ordered to take charge of him, and like a tamed
lion he was led forth. Ashmedai's concealed courage exhibited itself now
and then on the journey towards Jerusalem. As they passed one day a
gigantic palm tree, he asked for a rest under its shade, and when this
was granted, he rubbed himself so violently against it that it was
uprooted. Thereupon he passed a hut, the property of a poor widow, and
was about to demolish it, when the woman, seeing the giant about to lean
against the frail walls of her home, prevailed upon him to spare her
hut.

One day they met a blind man who became entangled amongst some bushes
and could not find his way out. Ashmedai took the man by the hand, and
led him out of his perplexed situation into the highway. So also they
met a man in his cups, who was nearing a precipice into which he was
about to fall, when his demoniac majesty hastened to get him out of
danger's way and placed him in a safe road. They passed one day through
a town where he heard a man calling out to a shoemaker, 'Heda, friend,
can you make me a pair of boots to last me seven years?' Ashmedai burst
out laughing at this. They met also a wedding party, with music

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

accompanying them. Ashmedai wept. They saw a wizard sitting on a large
stone telling a patronizing clientèle their future fate, and again
Ashmedai laughed. Benaihu was curious to know the motives of the demon's
conduct, but he could not be persuaded to explain himself, and said he
reserved the explanation for King Solomon himself. When they arrived in
Jerusalem, Benaihu brought his captive triumphantly before Solomon, who
was sitting on his throne surrounded by his counsellors and elders. At
the entrance of Ashmedai they rose from their magnificent divans.
Ashmedai, however, in great excitement and anger took a long staff, and
marking round himself a space of four yards in circumference, and
pointing to King Solomon, exclaimed, 'Look at this man, a king of dust
and ashes! When he dies, nothing will be his beyond a space of earth the
size of which I have just marked out, yet he is not satisfied to have
subjected all his neighbours and all the kingdoms as his tributaries,
but he must needs try to wrench the sceptre from the king of the
spirits. Otherwise, why have you, O great king, brought such contempt
and dismay upon me?' 'Be not angry with me,' returned Solomon, 'king of
spirits, and be assured that conquest is not the object of your
captivity. It is a matter appertaining to the glory of my God, who is
also your God. Tell me, then, where I can obtain the marvellous
"Shomir," of which I have need to cleave the marble and stones for the
House of God.' 'If that is the object,' returned Ashmedai, pacified and
reassured by Solomon's reconciling words, 'then I willingly submit to my
hard fate, and will also tell you where and how to obtain the
much-sought "Shomir." The "Shomir" belongs to the lord over all seas and
waters, but he has entrusted it for safe keeping to a mountain-bird in
the desert. This bird is to be found in the desert on a very steep,
barren hill there in a cliff it has bored out a hole, and keeps the
"Shomir," which was created in the evening

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

of the sixth day of creation, before the Sabbath was proclaimed.'

The services of the young hero Benaihu were again called into
requisition. Solomon addressed the youth with his wonted eloquence,
referring to the services he had rendered in the past, and entertaining
no doubt of the hero's willingness to render this consummate national
service of obtaining the 'Shomir,' the reward for which his royal master
would not bestow niggardly or grudgingly.

Benaihu replied by a profound bow before his majesty, and left the
palace to prepare at once for his hazardous journey. There is no need
for details of the hardships the young hero had to encounter on his
journey, where there was not a blade of grass, a drop of water, or a
shade for shelter from the merciless rays of the scorching sun, nor is
it necessary to relate all his adventures, and all the subtle designs
adopted to wrest the 'Shomir' from its guard. Suffice it to say that the
hardships and adventures of our hero were rewarded by success, and the
'Shomir' was at last in Jerusalem. Needless to say, there was great joy
and festivity in the Holy City, and the work (which lasted seven years)
now began in earnest, that of erecting, without iron or any other metal,
a structure for the worship of the God of Israel--a structure which was
the admiration of the world, and which has never been equalled in
majesty and splendour.

Ashmedai, the mighty king of demons, was all these years held captive by
Solomon in Jerusalem. He was very desirous to be informed by the chief
of the demons concerning the mystic spheres, but during the building of
the Temple he was too much occupied with the sacred business to be able
to spare time for anything else. After the consecration of the holy
edifice, Solomon had Ashmedai brought before him, and explained the
reason of his prolonged captivity, requesting him at the

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

same time, first of all, to explain to him his inexplicable conduct
whilst on the way to Jerusalem. 'What, for instance, prompted you to
guide the blind man into safety, when he was entangled in a bush? Surely
it could not have been compassion, a virtue to which a demon is a
stranger?' Ashmedai replied, 'That blind man is a most pious and
righteous man, and I heard it proclaimed in the higher spheres that
great reward should be his who should render that man a service.'

'And why did you lead the drunken man into the road away from the
precipice into which he was walking?' 'That man,' said Ashmedai, 'is
very wicked, and if he deserves any reward for ever having done anything
but evil, he should receive it here on earth.' 'And what provoked your
laughter when you heard a man inquire for boots to last him seven
years?' 'Simply,' said the master of demons, 'that the man had but seven
days more on earth.' 'Why did you weep on meeting a bridal party with
their music?' 'Mighty King of Israel,' exclaimed Ashmedai, 'this very
moment the last shred of flesh is gnawed off the bones of that
bridegroom; he died five days after I met the wedding party.' 'Last of
all,' demanded Solomon, 'what was the cause of your laughter on seeing
the wizard with the people who consulted him?' 'Why should I not laugh
when I saw a stupid person who professed to remove the veil of the
hidden future, whilst he knew not that under the stone on which he was
sitting there was hidden a kingly treasure?' <span
id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md)

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

King Solomon now intimated by a gesture that he wished to be left alone
with the king of the demons, and all his counsellors, ministers, and
high officials surrounding his throne left the palatial room. When the
king was alone with Ashmedai he addressed him as follows: 'The fact that
I carefully excluded all my advisers from hearing what there is between
us will have shown you that I have an important matter upon which I
crave information from you. I therefore want you, O Ashmedai, whose
power is infinitely above mine, because you know what is going on in the
higher as well as in the lower spheres, to tell me my own future.'
Ashmedai betrayed a satirical smile and said, 'It is perhaps not to be
wondered at that a monarch as wise and mighty on earth as you are, who
has acquired almost all the knowledge that it is possible for a mortal
man to possess, should long for knowledge of the supernatural from the
region of the unseen; but I must advise you to desist from this
ambition: it will not be of any use or pleasure to you.' 'No,' insisted
Solomon, 'nothing will induce me to abstain from increasing my
knowledge, for it is that, and not silver or gold, that I have set my
heart upon.' 'If my advice is to no purpose,' said Ashmedai, 'I will
proceed to open for you the hidden secrets, but it will be necessary to
release me from the chain I had put round me when I was made captive,
and you will, instead, have to give me the chain that adorns your
majesty's neck, and the ring with the name of God on it, which lies on
the table before you.'

Solomon did as suggested, took off his chain and put it on Ashmedai's
neck, and placed the ring on his hand. Scarcely had the master of the
demons closed his hand on the ring handed him by Solomon when a thunder
clap passed through the room which made the whole place vibrate. At the
same moment Ashmedai seemed to have grown into a terrible giant, his
eyes looked

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

like two great gleaming fires, his arms extended to enormous
proportions, and looked as though they would catch hold of the extreme
ends of the earth. Solomon trembled at the sight, his heart seemed to
stand still from terror, and he was about to call for help; but his
whole body was paralysed, his tongue refused its duty, and in the midst
of this he was seized by Ashmedai by arm and neck and thrown into the
air, and he became senseless. The men who had quitted the throne room at
King Solomon's bidding were all the time impatiently awaiting the
summons back to their king and master, but they remained in the
ante-room longer than they ever had to wait, when at last they received
the glad tidings, and the monarch summoned them to his presence. They
found, on entering the throne room, King Solomon sitting as usual on his
throne. They expressed their surprise at the absence of Ashmedai, whom
they had left in the room on retiring, but no answer was vouchsafed to
them. The king, however, took up the thread of conversation on the
subject upon which he was consulting when they retired from the room.
Yet they detected a marked change in the tone of the king's words, which
lacked that mildness and gentleness for which the wise Solomon was so
renowned.

Some of the ministers ventured to ask his majesty for the reason of this
change, but, instead of a reply, they received a sardonic laugh. It
occurred to some of the wise men that this might not be King Solomon,
but Ashmedai, the king of demons, who usurped their monarch's position;
but who could give expression to that dreadful thought?

King Solomon had been thrown by Ashmedai no less a distance than four
hundred miles from Jerusalem. For a long time he lay in the open field,
unconscious; as consciousness returned and he opened his eyes, he took
in the situation, but happily his wisdom had not failed, amongst his
other great qualities, to bestow on

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

him the habit of practising abstinence in the midst of his splendour,
and he occasionally used to subject himself to actual hunger, and
deprive himself of the necessaries of life, so as to cultivate the habit
of wanting things and not having them.

He now made up his mind to face his great calamity in the best way
possible, and resolved that, if need were, he would be bent, but not
broken totally by it. As a beggar he traversed the land over which he
had ruled with such splendour and power, and he was often thrown on the
mercy of one of his humblest subjects. Yet in the midst of this great
sorrow he proclaimed himself, wherever he came, the great 'Koheleth,'
King of Jerusalem.

No wonder that he was everywhere looked upon as insane! But he struggled
hard to make his way to Jerusalem, which he eventually reached, and on
his arrival at his metropolis he asked to be brought before the
Sanhedrin. He repeated to the Sanhedrin his assertion that he was King
Solomon, and related to them all the events that had happened to him.
His statement was received by the Sanhedrin, if not with derision,
still, with great mistrust and incredulity, and they were about to
declare him insane, when one of the Sanhedrin, wiser and bolder than the
others, rose and spoke as follows: 'Friends and worthy colleagues, whom
the Lord has graced with wisdom and understanding, it will not be
difficult for you to comprehend that any one afflicted with insanity
would not be able to make so coherent a statement as we have now heard,
but would wander about in his assertions incoherently from one subject
to another. Now, this man who asserts himself to be King Solomon, has
not spoken one incoherent word, and has given no indication of his
insanity, except his assertion in general that he is the great king our
master, and that assertion he made coherently enough. Besides this,
there is no reason

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

whatever, either in his demeanour, gesture or speech, to condemn him as
insane. Would it be consistent with justice, as shown to us by our Great
Lawgiver, to conclude that this man is insane, simply because he claims
the throne as his own, without further investigation as to who is the
one who now occupies the throne as King Solomon? Moreover, can we
overlook the fact that when we left the throne room there were two
individuals, and when we returned one had disappeared, without our being
able to comprehend how that happened? My advice is, that we request
Topos, one of King Solomon's many wives, that when the present king pays
her a visit, she may notice his feet, <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) and then on her report on this you can
form your judgment in this matter.' The Sanhedrin fell in with this
suggestion, and when they appealed to Topos, she reported that the king,
her husband, never entered her chamber without a cover over his feet.
The Sanhedrin requested her to try and remove the covering from her
husband's feet at the next opportunity. Topos did as requested by the
Sanhedrin, and reported that, to her amazement and disgust, she found
her husband's feet to resemble those of a cock.

The Sanhedrin were now concerned to have Ashmedai stripped of the chain
and the ring by which he had subtly obtained the throne from King
Solomon. In this they succeeded through a confidential servant of the
demon, and these precious and holy things were handed over to the
rightful owner, the real King Solomon, who now re-entered upon his
glorious throne. The wise king had the chief of the demons brought
before him, and exhibited to him the chain and the ring. The demon,
amidst a peal of thunder, made his escape from the palace, and was seen
no more.

Solomon was again in his former greatness, but was

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

till the end of his days in terror of demons; hence he had sixty of the
most valiant men of his army surrounding his bed.--Midr. Rabba Gen. 7
and 36; Exod. 30; Num. 5 and 11; Lament. 3; Ruth, Eccles., and Song of
Songs, and Midr. Tanchuma Emmor and Midr. Psalms, 78.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_15"></span>[36:1](tmm05.htm#fr_15.md) Demons resemble man in
these respects, they eat and drink, are fruitful and multiply, and die.
But they also somewhat resemble angels in so far as they have wings,
flying to and fro all the world over like angels, and knowing a little
of the secrets of the higher spheres--not quite as much as angels, but
generally the fate of men is known to them. Talmud. Chagiga 15/11. Hence
Ashmedai knew the late of those he met on his way to Jerusalem.
