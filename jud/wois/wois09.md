### THOSE NEAREST.

The punishments that come upon Israel are greater than those that come
on the peoples of the world. Because those that are nearest to God are
bound to be more holy than those that are far off. To them were given
more laws, and from them more is expected. "In those that are near Me I
will be sanctified."
