congregation of Babylon, in Zipori, when a calf that was being led to
the slaughter escaped, came up to him and cried, as if to say: "Save
me." He said to it: "What can I do for thee? For this thou wast formed."

And for thirteen years from that day our great Rabbi was punished by
suffering agony with his teeth. . . . At the end of this period, a
little reptile was, one day, passing in front of Rabbi Judah's daughter
and she wished to kill it, but the Rabbi said to her: "My daughter, let
it alone; for it is written (Ps. cxiv.), 'His mercies are over *all* His
works. . . .'" Then Elijah the Prophet appeared in a vision unto Rabbi
Judah, wearing the appearance

of Rabbi Chyia (a rabbi with whom Rabbi Judah had not been on friendly
terms), and laid his hand on the teeth, which were immediately healed.

Henceforth Rabbi Judah was exceedingly friendly with Rabbi Chyia, and
showed him great honour.
