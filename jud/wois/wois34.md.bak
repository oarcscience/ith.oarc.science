### REVELATIONS OF MERCY AND OF PUNISHMENT.

When God revealed himself to Moses at the burning bush, He broke off
between calling to him and revealing His will; but at the revelation in
the Tabernacle in the wilderness, there was no break; while in the
former case Moses was held, as it were, at a distance, and not in the
latter.

This may be compared to a king of flesh and blood, who is angry with one
of his servants and orders him to be imprisoned. When he commands the
messenger that is to announce the punishment, he does so only outside
his royal dwelling, and keeps the messenger at a distance and
deliberates before issuing the decree. Thus when God revealed Himself to
Moses at the burning bush, it was to announce punishments to Pharaoh,
who also was one of God's creatures and therefore loved by Him.

The revelation in the Tabernacle, on the contrary, was a message of
mercy and love only, made when God was rejoicing in His children, and
when the children of His house were rejoicing in Him. Then He spoke
commands to His messenger from within, as a father would speak to one of
his children and place him on his lap and place a hand upon his head.
