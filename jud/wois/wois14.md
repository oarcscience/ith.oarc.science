### THE STARS ARE NOT ENVIOUS!

The righteous are compared to the stars. For, as the stars (each one of
which could burn up this whole world) shine in glory, and never clash
together, and are never jealous of one another, but all go on in their
appointed courses, dispensing light, so the righteous are at peace with
each other, and are glad when others shine. Therefore we pray for Israel
that they may all be righteous, and then, "as the Lord maketh peace in
heaven," so there will be peace among us.
