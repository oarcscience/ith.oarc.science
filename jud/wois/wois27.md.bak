### THE LABOURERS IN THE GARDEN.

The Holy One, blessed be He, extends His mercy equally to animals and to
human beings. He is as full of compassion for the tiniest birds of the
air, as for the cattle. This is shown by the command (Deut. xxii. 6–7),
"If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way . . . thou shalt
not take the dam with the young. Thou shalt in any wise let the dam go .
. . that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest prolong thy
days." This is what the Scripture sayeth (Prov. v. 6), "Lest thou weigh
the path of life, her ways are moveable, thou canst not know them."
Rabbi Abin bar Cahana explains, "lest thou weigh the path of life," to
mean, "do not sit and weigh the commandments of the *Torah*, do not say,
'since this commandment is a great one I will fulfil it; for the merit
and reward will be very great, and as this other commandment is an
unimportant one, I do not perform it.'" What did the Holy One, blessed
be He, in order to guard men against this error? He did not reveal the
reward attached to each several commandment, so that all men might
fulfil all the commandments.

This may be likened to a king who engaged labourers and took them into
the midst of his park (*pardees*) and did not tell them what would be
paid for the different kinds of work there, so that they might not
neglect one thing, the wage for which was small, and all go and do
another thing, the wage for which was abundant. When the evening was
come, he called each one of them and asked:

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Under which tree
didst thou labour?" One answered, "I laboured under this tree"; and the
king said, "That is a Palpal, the pay for that is a gold piece." To
another who pointed out the tree under which he had worked, he said:
"That is an olive-tree, the pay for that is two hundred *zuzzim*," and
so on throughout the whole park.

Then the labourers said unto him: "Was it not necessary to tell us which
tree was the most precious, or that for the cultivation of which the
highest wage would be paid, so that we might work beneath it?"

But the king answered and said: "How, then, would all my park have been
cared for?"

In like manner the Holy One, blessed be He, only revealed the reward
attached to two of the commandments, the greatest among them all and the
least; and the reward for each of these is length of days, as it is
written (Exod. xx. 12), "Honour thy father and thy mother that thy days
may be long, etc." and "Thou shalt in any wise let the dam go . . . so
that thou mayest prolong thy days."

    .         .         .         .         .         .         .

Rabbi Berachya says, There are evils that smite a man like the arrow of
a huntsman smites a bird, and that fly like a bird; but the Holy One,
blessed be He, has said, "If thou wilt keep the command of mercy, and
let the mother bird go free, thou shalt be saved from all dangers such
as she fears," as it is written (Ps. xci.), "Thou shalt not be afraid of
the terror of the night, nor of the arrow which flieth by day"; and "He
will deliver thee from the fowler's snare, etc." There are some commands

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

for the keeping of which the reward is wealth; others for which it is
honour; but for this one, the pious man, if he be childless, shall be
rewarded with children. For you must not render verse 7 "Thou shalt let
the dam go and take the young to thee," but "Thou shalt let the dam go,
and thereby thou wilt gain children for thyself"; if thou art merciful
to the mother bird, thou, also, shalt be an honoured parent.
