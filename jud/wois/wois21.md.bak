### THE KING AND THE WEARY TRAVELLERS: THE RIGHTEOUS KNOW WHAT IS IN STORE.

All the reward of the righteous is prepared for them in the world to
come, but the Holy One, blessed be He, shows it to them while they are
yet in this world; so that their souls are satisfied and they go to
sleep in peace, and death has no terror for them.

Rabbi Eliezer says: "This may be likened to a feast that was made by a
certain king. He invited wayfarers to the feast, but when they came,
weary and travel-stained, he wished that they should rest before the
banquet. So he showed them the good provision he had made for them, and
said: 'See, this is what you will eat and drink in my palace.' Then they
laid them down and slept content." In like manner the Holy One, blessed
be He, shows to the righteous, while they are yet in this world, what
they are destined to enjoy in the world to come, and they lie down to
sleep: with peaceful souls they accept the summons to depart from this
life.

There is no material food in heaven; the angels feed on the light of the
Divine Presence. (The righteous have, in this world, seen a vision of
the light of God's presence.)
