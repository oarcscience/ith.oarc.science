### THE KING'S SON WITHOUT RATIONS.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"He hath not done so to any nation," etc. (Ps.
cxlviii.).</span>

</div>

Why did not God give the whole law to all the peoples; since all the
peoples of the earth belong to God? God gave some laws to Adam, more
still to Noah, still more to Abraham. He gave to all peoples such laws
as they needed, and could keep, and worldly prosperity as well. The laws
of right conduct, morality, and mercy, were given for all men; but at
Mount Sinai Israel said: "All that the Lord sayeth we will do and we
will hear." Therefore he showed them the distinction between clean and
unclean, between holy and profane, and gave them the Law of Holiness.
Rabbi Eliezar likened this to a parable of a king who went out to
battle, and his legions went with him. And meat was prepared, and he
gave portions to every one, rations according to their needs, and what
they wanted. Then said his son: "What will you give me?" Then said the
king: "I have given

thee no rations; thou shalt share what I have prepared for myself."
