<p>Rabbi Judah the Prince was seated teaching the Torah amidst the great congregation of Babylon, in Zipori, when a calf that was being led to the slaughter escaped, came up to him and cried, as if to say: "Save me." He said to it: "What can I do for thee? For this thou wast formed."</p>  
<p>And for thirteen years from that day our great Rabbi was punished by suffering agony with his teeth. . . . At the end of this period, a little reptile was, one day, passing in front of Rabbi Judah's daughter and she wished to kill it, but the Rabbi said to her: "My daughter, let it alone; for it is written (Ps. cxiv.), 'His mercies are over <i>all</i> His works. . . .'"

<p>of Rabbi Chyia (a rabbi with whom Rabbi Judah had not been on friendly terms), and laid his hand on the teeth, which were immediately healed.</p>  
<p>Henceforth Rabbi Judah was exceedingly friendly with Rabbi Chyia, and showed him great honour.</p>
