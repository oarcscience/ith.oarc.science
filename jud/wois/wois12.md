### BETTER FEED THE POOR THAN ENTERTAIN THE ANGELS.

He who does an act of kindness to those who really need it, will have a
greater reward than that of Abraham, who showed hospitality to angels.
Abraham stood under a tree and waited on the three strangers while they
ate and drank. And what reward had his descendants? The manna came down
to them, and the springs of water rose up for them; quails came around
them for their food, and the cloud of the Divine Glory stood to watch
over them. But Abraham's guests were angels, who needed nothing: how
much greater, then, will be the reward of those whose kindness is done
to the poor, who need all things?

Holy One stands at his right hand."
