### HE WHO REPROACHETH THE POOR INSULTS HIS MAKER.

When a rich man is asked by a poor man to give him charity, and he
refuses, and says to him, "Why don't you go and work? Look at your
strong arms and legs, and your stout body." Then the Holy One, blessed
be He, says to that rich man: "Was it not enough that thou didst not
give him anything of thine, that thou shouldst also cast an evil eye on
him for what I have given him?"
