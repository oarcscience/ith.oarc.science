### THE LIKENESS OF A PALM-TREE.

"The righteous shall grow like the palm-tree," says the Psalmist (Ps.
xcii. 13).

Just as the palm-tree, because of its great height, and because its
branches are high up, casts its shadow a long way off, while lower trees
have their shadow on the earth, just beneath

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

them; so the righteous have their reward in the far-off world of the
after-life.

Just as the palm-tree will produce fine dates and some that are bad, and
not fit to be gathered, so among the people of Israel, some are pious
and learned in the Law of God, others are ignorant, stupid, and wicked.

In another way Israel may be likened to a palm-tree. Nothing that grows
on the palm-tree is useless. It bears dates for food, *Lulabs* <span
id="fr_4"></span>[\*](#fn_4) that are brought into the house of prayer,
for rejoicing before God when The Praise <span
id="fr_5"></span>[\*](#fn_4) is sung; the branches serve for shade, and
the fibres are made into ropes; while the wood serves for the beams of
houses. Thus, in Israel, no one is without his aim in life, and his
proper function. Some are masters of Scripture, others of the study of
the traditional law, others of *Hagadah*. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[†](#fn_5) The mission of others is good works and of
others charity; and others have lower, but no less useful, work in the
world. None need be without his life-work. But as the central stem, the
heart of the palm-tree, always grows up straight towards heaven, so the
heart of the whole people, and of every individual, should be constantly
turned towards their Father which is in Heaven.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_4"></span>[22:\*](wois07.htm#fr_5) "The Praise," *Hallel*,
consists of Psalms cxiii.–cxix. inclusive, and is sung in the Synagogue
on every new moon and festival. During the eight days of Tabernacles,
palm branches, bound up with myrtle and willows (*Lulabs*), are waved
during this part of the service, as commanded in Exodus.
