### THE LAMP THAT GOES OUT WHEN ITS LIGHT IS DONE, AND THE FIGS THAT ARE GATHERED IN THEIR DUE SEASON.

What is the difference between the death of the aged and the death of
the young?

Rabbi Judah says:—"When a lamp goes out of itself, it is good for the
lamp and good for the wick, for the lamp is not broken and the wick does
not form coal; but when men extinguish it, it is bad for the lamp, and
bad for the wick."

Rabbi Abahu said:—"When you pluck figs at their proper season, it is
good for the figs, and good for the fig-tree. But if figs be gathered
before their time, it is bad for the figs and bad for the fig-tree."

Then why do we often see the righteous die young?

A story told of Rabbi Chiya bar Aba and his disciples, and according to
others of Rabbi Akiba and his disciples, and of Rabbi Joshuah, and also
of Rabbi Josi ben Chalafta and his disciples, explains this, by a
parable.

It was their custom to rise early in the morning, and to sit and teach
under a certain fig-tree. And the owner of the fig-tree used to rise
early and gather the figs. The scholars thought that they were
suspected, and that the figs were gathered early lest the Rabbi and his
disciples might eat some of them. What did they? They changed their
place of meeting.

Then the owner of the fig-tree went after them, and when he found them
he said:

"My masters, You were wont to confer a *Mitzvah* <span

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

honour, and give me a share in your reward for the study of God's word,
and give me the privilege of contributing my share to your deeds of
piety, by coming and studying under my fig-tree. Will you now rob me of
this privilege, this honour, this religious duty; and so make void all
your former kindness? Why have you changed your meeting place?"

Then they told him that they thought perhaps he suspected they might eat
some of the figs, because he always rose so early in the morning to
gather them.

"God forbid," exclaimed the owner of the fig-tree; "I rise early to
gather the figs because, if the sun shines brightly upon them, they
breed worms."

So he persuaded them to return and study under his fig-tree. That
morning he did not gather the figs, and the sun shone on the fig-tree,
and the ripe fruit bred worms, and was no longer fit to gather.

Then said the Rabbi and his students:

"The master of the fig-tree knows the season of each fig, and when it
ought to be gathered, and gathers it. Thus the Holy One, blessed be He,
knows the season of the righteous, and when it is best to remove them
from this. world."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3"></span>[19:\*](wois05.htm#fr_3.md) *Mitzvah*, from
*tzivah*, to command, to permit (comp. Æthiopic use of the root), is
quite untranslatable by any single word, in the sense in which it is
here used, and in which it is commonly used by modern Jews. *Mitzvah*
means here something commanded by God, or sanctioned by tradition and
religious practice, which it is an honour and a pleasure to do;
something that benefits the doer by giving him an opportunity for
holiness; some ethical or ceremonial activity pleasing to God, or
imparting a proud sense of self-satisfaction to the doer. Thus a rich
man will thank a beggar for the *Mitzvah* of giving the latter a Sabbath
meal; and, when the Warden of a Synagogue calls on a congregant to carry
the Bible up to the reading desk, this is "conferring a Mitzvah on him."
