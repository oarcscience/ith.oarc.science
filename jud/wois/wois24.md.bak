### THE TUTOR WHO CORRUPTED THE KING'S SON.

The people who perished at the time of the flood, says Rabbi Yochananan,
received their punishment, and have a share in the world to come. But
why was the *earth* destroyed, and why did the animals perish? Rabbi
Jodon said: "It is like a certain king who entrusted his son to a tutor,
who led him forth to evil ways, to vice and crimes so vile that the
king, in anger, slew his son. Then said the king: 'No one led my son
into evil ways but this man. My son has perished, shall this one remain
alive?'"

The world and its abundance led man to sin; the animals, even, were
corrupt.

The whole human race are God's beloved children; for them all was
created. The world had caused their ruin; it must perish with them.

Or, says Rabbi Pinchas, It may be likened to a king who caused his son
to marry, and prepared a splendid bridal chamber for him. But the son
turned to evil ways, and the king was angered and slew him. Then he
entered the bridal chamber and broke down its walls and tore the
curtains and destroyed all the ornaments. The king said: "Nothing of all
this was made except for my son; now he has perished, shall these things
remain?"
