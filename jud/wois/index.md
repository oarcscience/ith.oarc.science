This is a short anthology of passages from the Jewish wisdom literature
of the Talmud and Midrash, part of the Wisdom of the East series. Unlike
some similar compilations, Collins documents where possible the source
of his quotations. He also apparently translated from the originals
rather than reusing existing English renderings.
