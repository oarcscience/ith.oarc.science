### THE TWO PILOTS.

The Midrash, on Deut. xxx., says that Moses, who was allowed to call
down a blessing on his generation, when Israel had sinned in the matter
of the golden calf, is typified in every verse of Psalm xxiv.; and verse
5, which refers to him, should be rendered "He shall bear a blessing (to
others) from the Lord."

Rabbi Tanchumah thus explains it and says: "Thus Moses was greater than
all the pious men who had been before him. Even than Noah, who could
claim to be the only righteous man on

earth, and was saved when all his generation perished. For while his
righteousness saved himself, Moses saved his generation, as it is
written (Ex. xxxii.), "And the Lord repented of the evil He would do
unto His people."

This may be likened to two pilots, on board two ships, in a terrible
storm. One of them was able to save himself, but could not save his
ship; the other was able to save his ship as well as himself. Which
pilot would you praise? Surely the one who saved his ship.
