### THE INDUCTION ROBE OF THE ELDER.

Why are so many commands given to Israel beyond the laws of right
conduct that are binding on all mankind?

Rabbi Berachia says: "This may be likened to an elder (the principal of
a college for the study of law and religion) who had one long robe,
about which he was always telling his disciples: 'Shake this robe
carefully for me, fold it carefully,' and so forth. One day his
disciples asked him: 'How is it, Rabbi, that you are so particular about
this one robe? You have many other robes and you never tell us to take
care of them.'

"'This,' he replied, is the robe that I wore for the first time on the
day when I was appointed elder. It was the first outward sign of my
dignity and that my words would be hearkened to, and therefore it is
dear to me.'"

In like manner Moses said: "Oh, Sovereign of the universe, Thine are all
the nations of the world, yet Thou dost not tell me to give all these
laws to any one of them, but only to Israel."

He replied: "That is because they were the first nation to accept My
sovereignty, when, at Mount Sinai, they exclaimed, 'All that the Lord
commands we will do, and we will hearken to.'"
