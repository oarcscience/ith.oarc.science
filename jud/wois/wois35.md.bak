### THE CITIZEN MARRIED TO THE KING'S DAUGHTER.

<span class="small">"Also the soul <span id="fr_15"></span>[\*](#fn_14.md)

</div>

However much a man may heap up good works and pious actions, he can
never satisfy his soul. Rabbi Levi says: "This may be likened in a
parable to a simple citizen who married a princess of the royal blood.
Even if he made her to eat all the delicacies in the world, and gave her
every

delight, he could never fulfil all his obligations to her. Why? Because
she was the daughter of a line of kings. Thus also, whatever a man may
do for his own soul he can never do all that is required of him, because
the soul of man is from on high."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_14"></span>[54:\*](wois35.htm#fr_15.md) The word here rendered
"soul" is in this particular verse translated in the English Bible
"appetite," though elsewhere in the English Bible it is often rendered
"soul." The Rabbis, in this midrash, translate *nefesh* (soul) or "life
principle" as if it were *neshammah* or *ruach*, the spiritual part of
man. This is a good instance of the kind of agadic treatment of
Scripture described by me in the Introduction.
