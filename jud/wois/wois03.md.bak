### INTRODUCTION

THE extracts from the *Midrash Rabboth* and the Babylonian Talmud, given
in this little vol., are not the work of one or two authors, or of one
age. They belong rather to the speech and feeling of a whole nation than
to its literature, properly so called. At first, impromptu utterances,
or composed to be spoken in the course of sermons, popular addresses,
the speeches of honoured rabbis at marriage feasts or in the houses of
mourners, or in the rabbinic assemblies of Palestine and Babylon, these
and thousands of similar parables, fables, legends, and more or less
poetic playings of fancy around the facts of life, or round the popular
thought and knowledge of their time and place of origin, lived in the
mouths of the Jewish people, like the folk-lore and folksongs of other
nations, and were orally transmitted from generation to generation for
hundreds of years before being included in the compilations where we now
find them, and in other works now no longer extant. Their survival, and
their place in rabbinic literature, they owe to the fact that

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

everything was brought into relation with the Bible or with the
traditional laws of Israel; so that they became a part of the *Midrash*
or study of Revelation.

The terms *Midrash* and Talmud mean this study and interpretation of
Scripture, especially of the Mosaic Law, together with its application
to the changing conditions—mental and material—of the Jewish people. So
widely inclusive and so many-sided was this "Study of the Law," which
formed the chief mental activity of the Jewish people from the times of
Ezra and Nehemiah until long after the final redaction of the Talmud in
the 5th century, that there is hardly a single subject of modern secular
study that was not dealt with—at least incidentally; for life, as a
whole, was meant to be regulated by the Mosaic Law. Says Zunz in his
*Gottesdienstliche Vorträge*, still the chief authority on the
subject:—"Whoever applied himself profitably to, the various branches of
*Midrash* was a jurist, a theologian, a man knowing in the ways of the
world, a linguist, an orator—and if nothing was to be neglected, he must
have no slight acquaintance with history, natural science, and
astronomy." As a matter of course, specialization became necessary. But
the oldest subdivision of this "Study of the Law" is twofold:—into (a)
*Halacha*—practical rule of life, judicial decisions, the results and
finished products of Midrash; and (b) *Agadah*—that which is spoken, and
*placed before* the hearer, not as binding and having authority to guide
him, either in practical life or in belief, but as presenting a vivid
picture of ethical truth, of

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

beauty, or of thought, linking the less obvious meanings of Scripture
with the newer ideas and with the customs of non-Jewish peoples, and
providing for the spiritual or moral needs of the moment.

The *Halacha* was the transmission of the Mosaic Law in its application
to material life; to civil and criminal law, practical hygiene,
religious ceremonial, marriage and divorce, practical morality, the
daily conduct of individuals and of the nation in every conceivable
relation with each other, with the forces of nature, and with other
nations of the world. *Halacha* claimed to be an exact and literal
interpretation of the letter and spirit of the law given at Sinai, only
modifying its details in so far as traditions dating from Moses and the
prophets had provided for such modification, or where, hidden beneath
the letter of Scripture, hints could be discovered, showing that its
spirit actually demanded such modifications in foreseen changed
conditions. Differences of opinion on *Halacha* must be discussed in the
schools that combined the functions of a university and a parliament.

Not so the *Agadah*. Herein was room, and full liberty, for the freest
play of individual thought and fancy. As in *Halacha*, everything must
be referred in some way to the Scripture. But here there was no
obligation to interpret the revealed word strictly in accordance with
its real meaning. As often as not it is some new light, borne in upon
the teacher from his own experience, for which he seeks a reflecting or
intensifying medium in the revealed word. As a poet uses natural scenery

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

to illustrate the thoughts or emotions its aspect or his mood suggests,
so the *Agadists* used the texts of the Bible. The *Agadata* were not
the authoritative teachings of the rabbinic schools, but the occasional
utterances of individual rabbis and teachers. Remarkable was the freedom
with which verses of the Bible were often used to support views in
consonance, truly, with the general teaching of the Bible, but not at
all contained in the words themselves. The same rabbi would even
interpret the same verse in different ways to meet the requirements of
the lesson he wished to enforce. No harm was done; for every one knew
that this was not *peshat*—simple literal interpretation—but only
*drush*, or the homiletic use of Scripture.

This method of dealing with Scripture flourished exceedingly among the
teachers of the last century B.C. and in the succeeding two hundred
years, and appreciation of this fact will help materially in the
understanding of the New Testament. For instance, when the verse "Thou
shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn" is interpreted as
an admonition to support the preachers of the gospel, and it is added
that "Moses took no care for oxen," this is simply an example of
*drush*, and no one need accuse the New Testament writer of wishing to
deny that, in *peshat*, this verse is one of the many strict injunctions
to avoid all cruelty to animals—injunctions that form a prominent
characteristic of both the Mosaic Law and the Talmud.

But from every point of view the *Hagadic* writings, from some of which
the following

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

extracts are translated, should prove of the greatest interest to
students of the New Testament, and especially of the parables of Jesus.

Trench writes <span id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md) as follows:—"The
parable, as St Jerome has noted, is among the favourite vehicles for
conveying moral truth throughout the East. Our Lord took possession of
it; honoured it by making it His own, by using it as the vehicle for the
very highest truth of all. But there were parables before the parables
which issued from His lips." "There cannot be a doubt that our blessed
Lord so spake as that His doctrine, in its outward garb, should commend
itself to His countrymen. . . . Thus He appealed to proverbs in common
use among them. He quoted the traditionary speeches of their elder
rabbis. . . . When He found the theological terms of their schools
capable of bearing the burden of the new truth . . . He willingly used
them. . . . 'Thy kingdom come' formed already part of this Jewish
liturgy. . . . Nor less is it certain that the illustrating of doctrines
by the help of parables, or briefer comparisons, was greatly in use
among the Jewish teachers, so that it might be said of them, as of Him,
that without a parable they spake nothing."

Trench quotes several examples of rabbinic parables—among them one
dealing, in another way, with the subject of the one I give on pp.
[19](wois05.htm#page_19), [20](wois05.htm#page_20.md), "Why the good so
often die young." It is answered that God foresees that if they lived
they would fall into sin. "To what is this like?

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is like a king
who, walking in his garden, saw some roses, which were yet buds,
breathing an ineffable sweetness. He thought, 'If these shed such
sweetness while they are yet buds, what will they do when they are fully
blown?' After a while the king entered the garden anew, thinking to find
the roses now blown, and to delight himself with their fragrance, but .
. . he found them pale and withered and yielding no smell. He exclaimed
with regret, 'Had I gathered them while yet tender and young, and while
they gave forth their sweetness, I might have delighted myself with
them, but now I have no pleasure in them.' The next year the king walked
in his garden, and finding rosebuds scattering fragrance, he commanded
his servants, 'Gather them, that I may enjoy them before they wither as
last year they did.'" <span id="fr_1"></span>[\*](#fn_1.md)

"Again," he says, "there is one of much tenderness to explain why a
proselyte is dearer to the Lord than even a Levite. Such a proselyte is
compared to a wild goat which, brought up in a desert, joins itself
freely to the flock, and which is cherished by the shepherd with
especial love; since, that his flock, which from its youth he had put
forth in the morning and brought back at evening, should love him, was
nothing strange; but that the goat, brought up in deserts and mountains,
should attach itself to him, demanded an especial return of affection."
Moreover, there are very numerous parallels between the parables
scattered through the Babylonian and Jerusalem

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Talmud and the
Midrashic writings, and those found in the New Testament.

Much in the same spirit as the last parable cited by Trench, and
offering a curious parallel with New Testament examples, is the *agadic*
passage in the Babylonian Talmud stating that "the degree of blessedness
of the sinner who repents is much higher than that of the righteous man
who has never sinned, because those who have never tasted the sweets of
a sinful life have not the same difficulty in abstaining from sins."

But few, if any, of the following extracts have ever been translated
into English, and it is a matter of regret to me that the limits of
space compel the omission of at least ten times as many equally
interesting examples of *agada* that still remain inaccessible to the
English reader in their original Aramaic and Hebrew.
