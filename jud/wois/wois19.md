### THE EDUCATION OF THE PRINCE.

A certain king had an only son. Every day and every hour he would say:
"Now, my son, eat," "now, my son, drink," "now, my son, go to the house
of study," "now, my son, come from the house of study." There was no
moment

when the king, in his love and anxiety for his son, had not some
command, or instruction, or admonition for him. This is like the dealing
of the Holy One, blessed be He, with Israel. Every day He said unto
Moses: "Command the children of Israel," "say unto the children of
Israel," "speak unto the children of Israel." It is the love of God for
His people, and His will to make them perfect, in body as well as in
character, that accounts for His loading them with incessant
commandments.
