### THE OLD MAN AND THE ACORN.

A rabbi was passing through a field when he saw a very old man planting
an oak-tree. He said to him: "Why are you planting that oak-tree, surely
you do not expect to live long enough to see it grow up?"

"Ah," replied the old man, "if my ancestors had not planted trees we
should not now enjoy their shade or their fruit. What my fathers did for
me, that will I do for the future generations."
