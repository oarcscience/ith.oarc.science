### THE FATHER AND HIS SON: THE BATH AND THE OCEAN.

"And thou shalt return unto the Lord thy God."

Rabbi Samuel of Pargreeta says in the name of Rabbi Meir: "To what may
this be likened? To the son of a king who went away from home and turned
to evil ways; and the king sent a tutor to him with a message, saying,
'Return, my son.' And the son sent him back with the answer, 'How can I
come back to thee, oh sire, to be put to shame before thee?' Then the
king sent again to him, saying, 'Can a son be ashamed to come back to
his father, and if thou dost return is it not to thine own father that
thou dost return?'" In like manner, when God sent messages to Israel by
the prophets, telling them to repent, and they were ashamed by reason of
their sins, Jeremiah was sent to tell them, "If you return, it is to a
loving father that you are returning (Jer. xxxi.), for I have been a
father unto Israel."

Rabbi Channanya bar Papa asked Rabbi Samuel bar Nachman, what is the
meaning of the verse (Psalm), "As for me I will offer my prayer unto
Thee in an acceptable time "? He replied, "The gates of prayer are
sometimes open and sometimes closed, but the gates of repentance are
always open." It is like the difference between a gathering together of
waters made by man, and the great open sea. The waters that man has
drawn together reflect the face of heaven

when they are not dried up, and the man-made *Mikveh* <span
id="fr_14"></span>[\*](#fn_13) will cleanse one from impurity, but it is
sometimes closed: the vast ocean is always open. It always reflects the
light of heaven, and all may bathe therein at any time.

So the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, is at all times stretched
out to receive the repentant (those that return). Rabbi Onon says, "Also
the gates of prayer are always open."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_13"></span>[41:\*](wois23.htm#fr_14) *Mikveh* is a bath in
which living water flows. Such baths are made for every Jewish
congregation, and used on all occasions when the ceremonial or hygienic
law requires the taking of a bath.
