### THE POOR WOMAN'S MITE.

It happened that a certain poor woman brought a handful of flour to the
Temple as an offering, and the priest looked at it with contempt, and
said: "What is this to bring as an offering? What is there in this to
eat?"

Then that priest was rebuked in a vision, and it was shown him that her
offering was more acceptable to God than the sacrifices of the wealthy.
The divine voice said to him: "Thou shalt not look with contempt upon
her. It is as if she had offered her own life."
