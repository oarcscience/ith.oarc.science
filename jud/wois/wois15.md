### THE KING TALKS WITH ALL HIS SERVANTS, SMALL AND GREAT.

It is not to Israel alone that God has spoken and revealed His will; nor
even only to recognised prophets, whether in Israel or among the
nations. But to all who have His work to do He speaks, much or little,
clearly or in parables and visions, according to their needs and
according to their fitness to hear and understand.

When a king enters a province, to whom does he first speak? Surely to
the Governor of the province, who has all the responsibility for the

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

feeding and health of the inhabitants. In like manner God spoke to
Moses, who had all the trouble and responsibility of Israel on his
shoulders.

But Scripture tells of God speaking to Adam and to Noah; to the common
earth man and to him who was the type of the whole human race. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_9.md) This is like unto a king who speaks to his
own husbandmen, his gardeners, and the keeper of his cattle. For God
gave to Adam the task of keeping and tilling the Garden of Eden, and
Noah he commanded to take care of the cattle, and preserve them alive at
the time of the deluge.

In like manner, there is no man who has not some work to do in the
world, the garden of God, or that has not some living creatures under
his care.

It is no disgrace to the king to talk with the man who keeps his garden
and cultivates it, nor with his herdsmen; and the King of Kings will not
leave any of His creatures without guidance.

Rabbi Chamma bar Chanina, and Rabbi Issachar of Chapur Mandai, say, that
the difference between the prophets of Israel and the prophets of the
other peoples of all the earth, is that the prophets of Israel had a
fuller revelation. But the rewards and punishments of obedience or
heedlessness were only in proportion to the fulness of the revelation
given to each. Even the children of Israel were not held guilty under
the law

after the revelation at Sinai, until it had been taught, and explained,
and repeated to them from the Tabernacle.

This may be likened to a king who issues edicts. The people in his realm
are not punished for transgressing the new laws until time has been
allowed for their promulgation.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9"></span>[30:\*](wois15.htm#fr_10.md) There are, in Hebrew,
several words for "man." *Adam*, from the same root as *adamah*, the red
earth, the ground, is used for all mankind in general (Latin, *homo*),
and also as opposed to *eesh*, the higher type of man; while *geber*,
from a root suggesting strength, is nearly an equivalent for the Latin
*vir*.
