### THE LIKENESS OF THE KING.

Rabbi Pinchas, explaining the passage (Numb. xii.), "The likeness of God
appeared unto him" \[Moses\], said, in the name of Rabbi Hosea: "This
may be likened to an earthly king who shows himself in his true likeness
only to a child of his own household. For in this world the divine glory
is only revealed to individuals; but in the world to come God in His
glory will be revealed to *all*. As it is written (Isa. xl.), 'And the
glory of the Eternal shall be revealed, and all flesh together shall
see, for the mouth of the Eternal hath spoken it.'"
