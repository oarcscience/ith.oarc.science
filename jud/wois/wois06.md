### THE LABOURERS IN THE VINEYARD.

A pious and learned Rabbi, who died quite young, was the subject of this
parable.

"A certain king had a vineyard, and he hired a great number of labourers
to work in it. There

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

was among them one labourer who worked better and more quickly than all
the others, and even more than was necessary. What did the king? He took
him by the hand and walked about the vineyard talking with him. And at
eventide, all the labourers came to receive their reward, and that
labourer came with them, and the king paid him for the full day.

"Then the other labourers complained. They said: 'Behold we have worked
all the day while this one only worked two hours, and the king has given
him a full day's pay!'

"Then the king said: 'What right have you to be envious? This one did
more in his two hours of proper work, than you did, who toiled all day.'

"Thus Rabbi Bun bar Chyia learned more of the *Torah* in his
twenty-eight years of life than many another is able to learn in a
hundred years."
