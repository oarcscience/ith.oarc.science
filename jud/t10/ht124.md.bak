CRITICISM TO CHAPTER VII (KARAITES). THE BELIEF OF SADDUCEES, KARAITES,
AND OF THE REFORMED JEWS.

DR. MICHAEL L. RODKINSON.

Sir:--Having read your article about the "The Karaites" in *The American
Hebrew* (23-24), though in general I have found therein likely and
probable things, I cannot forbear from calling your attention to several
points on which, in my opinion, it behooves not a man like you to take a
partial view, while presenting to the readers a historic account. It is
the duty of every fair writer of history to give an account of the facts
without any personal bias, and where there is a difference of opinion,
without sufficient evidence for demonstrating the truth of any, then it
is the duty of the historian to state as much, and if he is able to
decide between them, he should give his opinion also; if not, he shall
leave the task of deciding to some of the readers who might be able,
perhaps, to do so. But you have not done so.

You have written (p. 685) that when Anan saw, etc., and have ignored, or
are unaware of, what the head of our poets, R. Jehudah Halevi, wrote in
his "Cuzari," III., 65, that in the time of Jehudah b. Tabi and Simon b.
Shetah Karaism commenced an account of what happened between the Sages
and the King Janæus, etc., see carefully that passage, you will find
there that R. Jehudah Halevi admits that the doctrine of the Karaites is
an ancient one. And you ought to mention this fact.

So also I do not agree with you in what you say, that at present are
found only 4--5,000 Karaites in the world. For, in my opinion, the
Reformers in Europe and America must be regarded as Karaites, as they
decided at their Congress at that they do not consider the Talmud as
authoritative, and that only the Pentateuch is the basis of their
doctrines. If it is so, then they are evidently also Karaites. And if in
some ceremonies they differ from the contemporary Karaites, for this
reason cannot separate them from them. You yourself enumerate sects
among the distinguished from each other in their ceremonies, and yet
they all avow the to be Karaites.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

This is what I have wanted to remark, and if you are conscientious, you
will modify this, not to mislead the future generations who will read
your history, and thereby you will insure yourself against critics, who
condemn a whole book when they find in it one thing which is not quite
right.

Your obedient servant,                   

ISAAC LEVI SHALIT.       

Answer.

With many thanks for your ingenious remarks, and for your love of truth
and eagerness to save me from unfair critics, I state at your desire
what I have to say in reply, and what I have omitted in the article
itself, viz.:

First--let it be known that I am not writing the history of the
Karaites, but that of the Talmud, and mention those who have contributed
to its extension and diffusion, as well as those who persecuted it, from
the time it had begun to develop till to-day. For this purpose it does
not matter whether Karaites were an old or a new sect, from the time of
Anan, as all admit that they persecuted the Talmud to the utmost. And I,
who have been, obliged to give briefly the history of the Karaites for
the reason that they persecuted the Talmud, used as authorities the
latest historians who have treated this subject, as Pinsker, Graetz,
Fürst, Geiger and Gottlober, who have all decided that it was an
invention of Anan himself. But out of respect to truth, I am bound to
tell you that I was not unaware of, nor did I conceal, what is written
about the Karaite sect in the "Cuzari." For of this has the head of the
reformed rabbis, the learned scholar Holdheim, written long ago, in his
book "Maamar Haishuth," as much as it is worth, and philosophized about
the assertions in the "Chasar," but he also found that be had been
mistaken in this (or that he was compelled to write this, for reasons
unknown to us at the present day; I myself say, he wrote thus because in
his days the Chasars were reported to also be Karaites, and he who made
his book in the form of a controversy between a Karaite and Rabbi did
not want to charge it with being a new sect, but admitting one point,
namely, that it is an old sect, he still urged that there is no
foundation for it). And to make you, and those who entertain the same
opinion, to cease to think that the reformers of the present time are
"Karaites," and also that the readers may know what the Karaites plead;
that the Karaite sect has been from the time of Moses, who was himself a
Karaite, and the Rabbinical innovation dates from Jeroboam b. Nebat, we
have only to quote from the above-mentioned book of Holdheim, p. 117,
etc., and also what he wrote to refute their assertions, p. 122, and
also what we will find to remark on his words.

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

 <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md)It is known that according to the
opinion of the Karaites themselves in their books, their belief and
their tradition is identical with the Pentateuch. Together with the body
of the Pentateuch, the Lord communicated to Moses an oral comment, and
he communicated to his contemporaries, who transmitted it to the
succeeding generations till the death of Solomon. When the people was
split into two parties, one adhered to Rehoboam, and the other followed
Jeroboam, who sinned and led his party into sin. The Karaites named
their traditions the inherited yoke and burden, and according to them
there was during all that time only one Torah for the whole people, as
one God, and the text and its interpretation were inseparable and sprung
from the same source, the father of the Karaites being Moses himself,
the trusted pastor who carried all his people on his shoulders. As
Jeroboam was one of those who had received the tradition transmitted
from age to age as above-mentioned, and one of the men of the Great
Sanhedrin, fearing that the royal power should be recovered by David's
dynasty, he invented strange and spurious interpretations of the Torah
to replace the good ones and true ones which the Sanhedrin had by
tradition. He presented it to the people, whom he misled, and brought to
evil. The nation believed him, followed in his footsteps, exchanged most
commandments of the Torah for others, subtracted, added, at their
pleasure. Since then Israel was divided into two sects, and the Torah
became two rival and hostile Torahs. Judea kept the law according to the
ancient custom received from Moses without any change, addition or
subtraction, Karaism. being the modern continuation thereof. Israel, on
the other hand, observed the laws according to the new manner, with
alterations, additions and subtractions invented by Jeroboam, and
Rabbinism is its continuation; later false prophets rose in Israel, and,
claiming divine inspiration, misguided them, and even some of Judea,
etc. But Judea, nevertheless, continued to be the seat of the Mosaic
tradition, as the majority adhering most to the truth. However, as the
Temple was demolished, most prophets, priests, Levites and Sanhedrin
were slain, while those left alive were mostly of the sinners. Therefore
at the restoration of the second Temple, even while there still were
prophets, who are called the "good figs," there were two sects and two
separate Torahs. After the cessation of prophetic inspiration this split
grew and widened. The party holding by the truth said the Torah was only
that one written by Moses and given to Israel; the party believing in
the falsehood said there were two Torahs,

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

written and oral, invented by Jeroboam and the false prophets, and which
they also referred to Moses, who received it (according to them) from
the Lord. Thus it continued till the time of Matthew, the Hasmonean
(Maccabee), when Antiochus the Wicked, wishing to suppress altogether
the Jewish lore, in which time of calamities all great sages of the
Sanhedrin who had the true tradition of the comment and the Torah were
all murdered, and the tradition till then transmitted, was now severed,
and the greater part of the comment and the Torah was lost and
[forgotten](errata.htm#36.md), only an infinitesimal fraction being left.
This fact took place in the year 3560 after creation.

As Matthew triumphed, and peace was restored in the land, the men of
intellect sat down to learn the Torah and understand it with the aid of
their reason. But owing to its great depth, they could not comprehend
it, and many diverse opinions existed. Thus the differences between
sects, Karaite as well as Rabbinical, arose, and persist to these days.

The quarrel between the two sects grew in violence till the time of the
king and high-priest Janeus was reached, and something happened between
the sages and him, as is well known, so that be massacred all the sages
in his anger, and none remained except one great man of each sect,
Jehudah b. Tabai, who held the truth, and Simeon b. Shetah, drawn after
the false doctrine of Jeroboam b. Nebat and the false prophets. The
king, wishing to kill both, Jehudah b. Tabai hid in Jerusalem, and
Simeon b. Shetah was the queen's brother, who facilitated his escape to
Egypt, where he stayed three years; being there, he learned from the
Israelite sages found there since the destruction of the first Temple,
and the days of Jeremiah, all the strange comments invented by Jeroboam
and the false prophets. Simeon b. Shetah added thereto some of his own,
and built there a great temple and sacrificed there, though it was not
the chosen place; and after his return to Jerusalem he wanted to be a
great lord in Israel, and taught, therefore, the people what he had
acquired in Egypt, as the oral law communicated to Moses, and
transmitted by him; and, because he was the king's brother-in-law and
had much influence at the court, his false doctrines became popular
among Israel, who received the false Torah instead of the true one.

After that Israel was divided into two parties, and the quarrel
commenced also in the Sanhedrin, the heads of the nation, and heirs and
teachers of the Torah. One sect went after R. Jehudah b. Tabai and was
called Sadducees (Zadikim) (Upright), from the phrase "hearken unto me,
ye that pursue righteousness" (Zadik)

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[Is. li., i.\],
and their justice is everlasting justice, and their Torah is truth;
Karaism is a continuation thereof. The second sect followed Simeon b.
Shetah, and were called Pharisees (Parushim), separatists, for
separating themselves from the old faith of Israel. This state of things
continued from 3650 after creation, from the time of Jehudah b. Tabai,
till the ruin of the second Temple, year 3828. At that epoch, the
majority of the Sadducees were slain, but the Pharisees mostly survived,
for which there were two causes: first, because those of the Sadducaic
party were the political and warlike men, while the Pharisees were
humble and were students; secondly, because the Sadducees were stricter
in observing the duties, and their conduct was of much holiness and
purity, and had seen that if they were to be exiled, being an unclean
earth, and without water for removing the uncleanness, they could not
keep the law as it ought to be; therefore they were martyrs, choosing to
be murdered rather than live, and all were killed for the sanctification
of the Lord. Put the Pharisees who were not strict, and were not afraid
of the ruin of the Temple or exile, and chose life rather than death,
and went out to Titus, the Wicked, and, surrendering, were all left
alive. Therefore, after the ruin of the Temple the Pharisees rose in
power, whereas the Sadducees declined. Thus it continued till R. Jehudah
the Nassi, the editor of the Mishna. He collected all comments, good and
bad, true and false, ancient and recent, all together; he wrote them
down in a book without making distinctions between the sacred and
profane, unclean and clean; he decided and declared that they are all
Sinaic. This occurred in 3945.

After the conclusion of the Mishna, rose up those who composed the
Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds, and from that time on the quarrel
grew in force, and the hate, rivalry and jealousy grew between the two
sects, the Sadducees and Pharisees. For the Sadducees held the true
Torah, written by Moses our teacher, and those few true comments that
have been left from many; but the Pharisees abandoned the written Torah
and ignored it as of subordinate importance, and clung to the oral law,
that is, the Mishna and the Talmud, making it the thing of the first
importance, saying that tradition will be victorious. They said every
one who studies the written law has fulfilled only partially his
obligations, but every one who studies Mishna or Talmud he has
completely discharged his obligations; every one who trangresses the
written law is culpable of stripes, who transgresses the words of the
sages is guilty of capital punishment, and that one should not object
even if they say to you of the right that it is the left, and of the
left that it is the right and similar erroneous teachings. Thus it
continued to be till

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

the time of Anan the Nassi, the Holy and the Saint, the son of David the
Nassi, in the year 4400 after the creation. Anan <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) lived in Babylonia and was of the
Sadducees, and for his great wisdom Israel, Sadducees as well as
Pharisees, chose him as Nassi, as the head of Beth Din and Exilarch.
After his instalment as Nassi and head of Beth Din by the sanction of
the Arabian monarch, and the will of all Israel, he became zealous for
God and his Torah, and wished to restore it to its primitive purity; he
commenced to plead against the oral law, *i.e.*, the Mishna, and deny
and declare it as nought. When the Pharisaic sect perceived all this,
they rose upon him and devised stratagems to kill him. But out of fear
of the king, they did not lay their hands on him, but denounced him to
the king that he had rebelled against the law of the government, but the
king pitied him and saved him from them, and so he was left alive. When
Anan perceived that the Pharisees did not want to return to the truth,
he was disgusted with being a Nassi, left his house and possessions in
Babylonia, and departed with his sons and disciples to Jerusalem, the
Sacred City. He built there a synagogue, "The Temple of God," to pray
and to weep morning, noon and evening; and perceiving that the Pharisees
were increasing, and that the Sadducees decreased, and fearing lest the
true Torah be forgotten entirely, and lest the Sadducees be absorbed in
time by the Pharisees, he commanded his disciples, friends and
acquaintances, to keep themselves apart from the sect of the Pharisees
wholly and with the utmost possible strictness. He forbade them to eat
*their* foods, for *they* are not careful about all kinds of
uncleanness, and eat carcasses and tallow prohibited by the Torah. So
also he forbade them to intermarry with them, because they had
trespassed the barriers of consanguinity. And Anan interpreted the Torah
and commandments according to the true comment, as he had received it
from his fathers and masters by tradition, who belonged to the sect of
Sadducees, continuing from the oldest times; and as the whole Sadducean
doctrine is founded on the text of the Holy Scriptures, Pentateuch,
Prophets and Hagiographas, therefore Anan the Nassi called the Sadducean
sect "Karaites," (Karaim), that is, who are *called* and go in their
simplicity. (Ba'ale Mikre): and as the whole object of the Pharisees was
to pursue high positions and *lordliness*, and also because they are
*many* in comparison with the

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

few Karaites, he called them "Rabbanim," (lords, many), that is, the
adherents of the Mishna and Talmud. . . .

This is the opinion of the Karaites themselves about their history, and
that every one who wishes to know and understand all the errors of the
Rabbis (according to them), should see the Book of God's Wars, ("Sepher
Milhamoth Adonai"), by Salman b. Jerucham I and the Admonitory letter
("Igereth Hatochachath"), by Sahal Hakohen, and "Eshkol Hakopher," by
Jehudah Hadasi Haabel (the Mourner), he called himself thus for
mourning, and "Apiryon Asah," and "L'hem Sheorim," by R. Solomon the
Turk, also the "Asara Maamaroth," of Elijah the Jerusalemite, and the
"Amuna Omen" by Abraham b. Joshua the Jerusalemite, all which books are
written to refute the false Rabbinical laws; and of the Rabbinical sages
after Anan they say that when they saw that the plain and just truth is
evidently on the side of the Sadducees, they invented about them
calumnies, that they were Sadducees, and Bithusiaus followers of Zaduk
and Bithus, the infidels, and their glory they confounded with shame by
conscious falsehood for whereas they had been called Tzadikim from
ancient times, they altered their name to Tzadukim (Sadducees, Zadukim),
followers of Tsaduk, etc., etc."

. . .  <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md)Here we have given to the
reader what we have briefly quoted so far as needful for our purpose,
and to spare much of our own discussion by citing the words of another.
From "Orah Tzadikim" treating of the split between the Karaites and
Rabbis, written by the scholarly rabbi, Sim'ha Isaac of Lutzki in 550.
And we, desiring to call the attention of scholars and thinkers to the
affirmations of the Karaites themselves about their ancient history,
both their charges against us and their justifications of themselves,
have abridged their statements, for it is our duty to hear what they say
for themselves, and try to separate the truths from the falsehoods as
impartial judges, not as advocates.

And, before all, I say, the man is dreaming who speaks that the
difference between the Karaites and Rabbis began in the time of
Rehoboam; the son of Solomon, and of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, when
Israel revolted against David's dynasty. And if the Rabbi, were to make
such a senseless assertion, that the rebels against David's dynasty were
the same that the Karaites are, beyond doubt the Karaites would say that
they pervert the words of the living God and deny what is written in the
Prophets, that Jeroboam led a away the people from the worship of the
true God who had protected

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

them from the times of Egypt till then, to serve golden calves which he
had made, and made a festival in a wrong month which he invented that
the people should not go to celebrate the holidays at Jerusalem, and the
royalty not be restored to David's house. The Karaites state here a
strange fiction, which is ridiculed by every one who has any knowledge
of books.

Besides that, any one who has eyes to see, ears to hear, and a palate to
taste, that which is written in the Scriptures, is aware that during all
the time of the prophets till the exile of Israel and Judea from their
land and captivity in the land of their enemies, the quarrel between the
parties was not about the interpretation of the Torah, or about the
reasons of the commandments, but about the Torah itself, between those
who knew it and those who did not know it, between the worshippers of
the true God and the idolators. The prophets of the true God, and the
best element of the people who followed them, have served God and loved
him, and were his true servants, adhered to him and observed his
commandments and his law. But the king and the common people devoted
themselves to drink, to idolatry, adultery, and other uncleanness of the
other nations of their time.

And truly, the author of the "Orach Zadikim," as well as the writers
whom he quotes, have not adhered to the truth but indulged in
falsehoods, by fixing the beginning of this quarrel at a time which it
was impossible to have begun. And if the author and his co-religionists
fully believe that the present Pentateuch was known to and in the
possession of the names in the days of David and Solomon, Rehoboam and
Jeroboam, and that, together with the written Torah and its
commentaries,--it was in the possession of the Sanhedrin and the members
of the great and small Beth Din of those days, as the same belief was
entertained by the Pharisees from the written Torah and its
commentaries, we will not plead with them to question or reflect upon
this belief, and state from the investigations of the modern as well as
the ancient critics, that the Pentateuch was at that time of recent date
and no one knew of it because it had been written only in the days of
Solomon, and no one had seen it,--for it would be unfair to refute a
warranted belief on one hand by a total denial on the other. But we will
argue from the standpoint of the Karaites themselves, who adhere to the
text and deny the commentaries which are conflicting with the ordinary
interpretation of the Scripture. For they themselves have interpreted
the Scripture wrongly, and ascribed to it a meaning which has never been
intended, by stating that the quarrel between Israel and Judea,

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

or between Jeroboam and Rehoboam, has caused a quarrel, in no way or
manner resembling it, between the Karaites and the Rabbis regarding the
interpretation of the Scripture. This is one of those falsehoods which
have absolutely no foundation whatever, and are shunned by those who are
able to distinguish between truth and falsehood.

The statement that the difference between the Karaites and Rabbis dates
from the time the difference between Jehudah b. Tabai and Simeon b.
Shetah broke out, etc., is nothing but a net spread out by the Karaites
to catch therein the people of Israel, etc. But it is up to date not
known who is the author of this statement and who circulated it among
the Karaites that they might make it the foundation of their structure,
which foundation, if demolished, would cause the ruin of the whole
structure.

There is no doubt in our mind that the Karaites have borrowed this
statement from the Pharisees when endeavoring to separate from the
Sadducees, whom they also considered as infidels, and to erect a new
edifice for themselves, for the Pharisees also consider Simeon b. Shetah
to have restored the Torah to her old .glory, as they state in the
mentioned Boraitha: "The world was embarrassed until Simeon b. Shetah
appeared and restored the Torah to her former state." And here they
found an opportunity to use the Pharisees' arguments against them. The
Pharisees say that after the massacre of the sages and those learned in
the traditional law by Johanan Hyrcanus, the oral law was forgotten in
Israel till Simeon b. Shetah came and restored it. By oral law is meant
that traditional comment on the Torah as it was afterward written down
and concluded by R. Jehudah-the Nasi and his successors in the Mishna
and Talmud against which the Karaites protest. Now, the difference
between restoration and innovation is insignificant, and what the
Pharisees and Rabbis term restoration the Karaites name innovation, and
maintain that Simeon b. Shetah made a new law, that is the oral law
which was unknown previously, and had not descended to them from their
forefathers: and from this new law a new quarrel sprung forth among
those who believed in tradition, which quarrel has no connection
whatever with the old controversy between the disciples of Sadduk and
Bithus, the infidels, and the Josees, the believers, on whom all Israel
leant.

As for the statement of the Karaites above mentioned that their belief
dates from the time of the second Temple, etc., and that only Anan
brought it to light again, after it had disappeared, the same was very
ably criticised by the scholarly rabbi, S. J. Rapaport

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> ("Kerem Hemed," p.
200), by laying out his own plan for the investigation of the causes of
the Karaite history; he says, namely: "The activity of Anan was not
isolated in its kind, but it war, only a link in the chain of the
history of the nations of those days. For there existed religious
differences among the Arabians, some holding only the Koran and what
Mahomet communicated to his son-in-law Eli, and who are known as the
Shitin; while some held the traditions communicated by Mahomet, his wife
and son-in-law, his sons, and many disciples, who are known as the
Shonin."

And it seems that this religious quarrel has, to our shame, infected the
Jews; Anan and Saul, his sons, tried to establish a new sect in Israel
similar to the Shitin, for they thought that the Arabian high officers
would assist them, for they would be at one with them in taking for the
basis of their belief only what is written in the text, and to deny
tradition. And how many times have religious movements, similar to
those, taken place among the nations among which we live, even in our
own times.

Having thus laid before the reader the views of the Karaites themselves,
*i.e.*, of those later Karaites who endeavored to justify Anan for his
complete separation from the Rabbanism, although Anan himself was very
far from doing so, as can easily be seen by every one who has some sense
of his own, from the statement of Anan: "And I will prepare you a Mishna
and Talmud myself," (*vide supra*, [27](ht110.htm#page_27).md), and also
some of the opinions of the scholars Holdheim and Rapaport, we wish to
submit our own opinion in regard to this matter.

In our judgment they all erred in making the following two assertions,
viz: that the Sadducees did not believe in retribution in the world to
come; and that the Talmudists had no knowledge of a sect naming itself,
or which was named by others, Karaites. The error in making these
assertions caused them to draw farfetched inferences and to write a
number of articles, which will not stand any proper criticism. For
Holdheim, in refuting upon the assertion of the Karaites that their sect
was founded in the days of Jehudah b. Tobai, fixes their origin at a
much prior date, by stating that the Sadducees and Karaites are one and
the same sect, and that the latter name was adopted by them at a later
date, but at the time of the Talmud they were known by the former name,
and that accounts for not finding the name Karaites in the Talmud, (see
at length, ibid., p. 25), basing his assertions on Maimonidus and
Abraham b. David of Paskira. Some of these assertions may be found in
Rapaport, although he tries to reconcile

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

both sides. And because the Karaites differed from the Sadducees in that
the latter did not believe in resurrection, and, according to him, also
not in retribution after death, Holdheim asserts that the Karaites, who
are the same as the Sadducees, have adopted that belief only at a later
date, when that belief has already been adopted by all other nations and
religions.

And coming to such conclusion he justifies the Sadducees and their
views, and gives them preference over the Rabbanism and *their* views,
which constitutes almost the whole subject of his book. But we will
prove his error, and therefore most of his assertions will prove of no
value, and the Talmudists and their views and teachings will remain true
and everlasting.

But before attempting to explain ourselves in more detail we feel it our
duty to say a few words in regard to Resurrection, which is the basis of
the whole contention between the scholars above mentioned and the sects
themselves.

The first Mishna in Chapt. Halek (Sanhedrin) reads: "The following have
no share in the world to come: the one who says the Resurrection does
not originate from the Pentateuch," which is explained by Rashi as
follows: "*i.e.*, he who does not believe in the inferences drawn later
on in the German that resurrection originates from the Bible; and even
if he does believe in resurrection, but says that it does not originate
from the Pentateuch, he is an infidel, for if he does not believe in its
origin from the Bible what do we care for him or his belief? Wherefrom
does he know that so it is? He is, therefore, a perfect infidel." And
although some doubt whether these quoted words came from the pen of
Rashi, because it was not Rashi's way to enter into lengthy
explanations, still all concede that it expresses the true meaning of
the Mishna.

Now, if we will take the true intent of the Talmudists, that although
one believes in resurrection he is an infidel, if he does not believe
that its origin is from the Pentateuch, we will at once conceive that
when the latter belief began to circulate among all nations and among
the masses of Israel to such an extent that, it was considered an
essential element of the belief in God, and that any religion which did
not consider it one of its dogmas, was not worthy of being ranked as a
religion at all, the Talmudists endeavored to prove the origin of this
belief from the Pentateuch and that other nations and religions borrowed
it from *that* source, in order to refute those who asserted that its
origin was in the New Testament and, therefore, the latter was the
principal religion and the former ceased to exist.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

We will now take up another Mishna in Tract Berachoth, P. 54*a*: "Since
the Sadducees have perversely taught that there is only one state of
existence, it was ordained that it shall be pronounced: 'From Eternity
to Eternity,'" which Rashi explains, *i.e.*, "that they denied
resurrection." Rashi again diverts the Mishna from its plain meaning,
that the Sadducees did not admit the existence of the world to come,
*i.e.*, retribution after the soul separates from the body, and limited
their disbelief to resurrection only; (and that the meaning of
"perversely taught" means that they perverted from their own opinions
and taught the masses that belief).

It is self-evident that the perversion of the Sadducees consisted,
according to Rashi, only in denying the inferences drawn to establish
the origin of resurrection in the Pentateuch. But from the dispute of
the Sadducees with the founder of the Christian religion, or with his
disciples, and from the derisive question, "whom of them a widow of
seven brothers will marry after resurrection," which is quoted in the
work of Azariah Di Rossi, we can easily see that the Sadducees did not
believe in resurrection *at all*.

If we will examine carefully the interpretations of the Talmudists in
desiring to find a hint for resurrection in the Pentateuch, and that
they did not infer it from the plain statement (Deutr. xxxli. 39): "*I
alone kill and I make alive*; I wound and I heal," which, on every
occasion they explained to mean "as the healing follows the wound, so
also does life follow death" (see Ben Ezra), but resorted to far-fetched
interpretations instead, we will clearly see that the Talmudists did not
wish to state that resurrection is *expressly* stated in the Pentateuch,
for in such case they would, of necessity, have to admit that this
belief was known and circulating at the time the Pentateuch was given.
They only wanted to find some slight reference to it in the Pentateuch,
and were of the opinion that the belief in resurrection was known only
to a limited number of select men, but not to the masses, from whom it
was kept secret, for fear that they might as well believe in "familiar
spirits" and "wizards ("Ob and Yaduni"), or in "inquiring of the dead."
But only after this belief has been borrowed from the neighboring
nations and has been adopted by the masses, the Talmudists found it
necessary to find some source for it in the Pentateuch in order to
strengthen the latter, although not explicitly stated therein.

It follows from all this that at the time the Mosaic Law was proclaimed,
that belief was not only not obligatory, but on the contrary every
effort was made to keep it from the masses, and,

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

therefore, no promises were made as to resurrection, but only as to
longevity and tranquillity during life-time.

When, however, the founder of Christianity made this belief one of its
dogmas and minimized the Old Testament, the Talmudists made it
obligatory to believe that its source is in the Pentateuch. And the
Sadducees who rejected this belief at all were considered as
disbelievers.

But we find nowhere that the Sadducees ever denied the immortality of
the soul or that they ever denied the belief in retribution after death,
for according to all opinions the Sadducees were not the disciples of
Autigonus of Socho, Zaduck and Bithus, who, according to a statement in
Aboth d'Rabbi Nathan, rejected the belief in retribution. The name
Sadducees, as we have said in the beginning of this article, had its
origin from Zaduck the high priest of David, according to Geiger's
opinion. Or, perhaps, Holdheim's opinion is the correct one, viz.: that
in the beginning they were surnamed "Zadikim," as Simon the high priest
was surnamed the "Zadik."

Neither do we find anywhere that the Sadducees repulsed the statement of
the Talmudists, to wit: "In order that thy days may be prolonged"
(Deutr. v. 16), that means in the world to come which is prolonged
(endless), and as the simple proof, if one say to his son: "go up on the
roof and examine the bird's nest, and take the young ones, and send away
the mother, in both of which (sending away the mother and honoring the
father) longevity is the promised compensation in the Pentateuch; and
the son in doing so fell and was killed; how can the promise be
fulfilled? We must, therefore, say that the promised longevity has
reference to life after death." Nor is it anywhere found that the
Sadducees refuted the statement of the Talmudists: "That person shall be
cut off" (Numb. xv. 31); that it means, he should be cut off from this
world as well as from the world to come."

The assertion of those who consider themselves competent to make it,
that there is no basis in the Pentateuch for the immortality of the
soul, is not correct, for besides the many plain passages indicating.
that, the same can also be established from the necessity of the
marrying the widow of the deceased childless brother, for if the soul is
mortal what is the benefit of "raising up the deceased's name?" So,
also, greatly err those who, from this very passage, draw a contrary
conclusion, *i.e.*, by asserting that because the soul dies together
with the body the Pentateuch commanded that decedent's name be raised up
if he die childless, for if the soul dies as does the body, why all that
trouble of marrying

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

the widow, or the ceremony of the "Chalitza," and spitting out before
the one who refuses to marry the widow of his deceased childless
brother, as commanded by the Pentateuch? If the soul derives no benefit
therefrom, why all that? There is no honor in all that either for the
dead or for the living, and it is very well known that this custom of
raising up the name of the deceased on his estates was known and
observed in ancient times, and the family that did not observe this
custom incurred disrespect.

Thus far as to the Pentateuch, but as regards the prophets or
Hygiogropha only a blind man can fail to find in them retribution and
immortality of the soul after death. The whole book of Isaiah is full of
that, and it says plainly (Isa. lvi. 4-5): "For thus saith the Lord
concerning the eunuchs (those who die childless) I will indeed give unto
them, in my house and within my walls, a place and a name better than
sons and daughters, an eternal name--they shall not be cut off." And not
to mention about the early and the later Hygiogropha (Ps., xvi. 10):
"Thou will not abandon my soul to the grave," and also (ibid. xxvii.
13): "Unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the Land
of life." And it is also explicitly stated, (ibid. xxv. 13): "His *soul*
shall abide in happiness; and his *descendants* shall inherit the land."
Now, how can it enter the mind that the Sadducees, who, according to
Holdheim, are the Karaites, whose only endeavor was to give the whole
Scripture, not only the Pentateuch, the illiteral meaning of the words
will deviate from the literal meaning, and explain all those passages as
referring only to this earthly life? We can also see from the fact that
the Sadducees were more strict as to purification than the Pharisees in
going as far as saying that profane writings (the book of Homer) make
the hands unclean, to such an extent that if they touch Terumah the
latter must not be eaten; that they believed in immortality of the soul,
which they considered to such an extent clean that they will not
tolerate the least uncleanliness in a sacred thing. And how much did the
Sadducees sacrifice themselves in order to prevent the enemy from
defiling the sanctuary? How much did they sacrifice themselves for the
sake of the Holy name (‏קידושהשם‎), which no one who does not believe in
immortality would do? But Holdheim seems to advance a strange assertion,
viz., that the Sadducees believed in immortality of the soul and
nevertheless denied retribution, which we can by no means understand,
because what is the benefit of immortality if there is no retribution?
If all are equal and alike after death, the righteous and the wicked,
the wise and the fool? (The philosophy of Aristotle concedes

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

at least that the soul of the righteous unite with the (‏שכלהפועל‎)
after death, but according to Holdheim there is absolutely no preference
to the human soul over that of the animal). It is true that we heard
some few years ago (in 1885) in Leipsic, at a meeting of spiritualists,
in company of the late Dr. Mandelkern, a professor, state in his lecture
that the spirit of a certain man who, during his lifetime was one of the
easy-minded, rested upon his shoulders for about two weeks, and that he
was then of the same disposition as before death, and from this he drew
the conclusion that the soul remains the same after death, in the
spiritual world, as during the lifetime, but we hardly believe Holdheim
ever entertained this belief, which is contrary to common sense, and
still more, he endeavors to make his beloved Sadducees entertain such
belief.

Dr. Geiger's opinion that the whole contention between the Sadducees and
Pharisees was originally over political affairs, the former struggling
to have the control over such affairs, because of their descent from
prominent families, and the latter not desiring to submit, and from this
the contention extended to civil and religious matters; the Pharisees
being extremely faithful to their traditions saw in everything the
Sadducees differed from them, a denial in tradition;--seems to be more
correct, as being also supported by history. The same theory is followed
by I. H. Weiss in his work "Dor Dor V'dorshow," who proves conclusively
that the Pharisees always laid down their decisions in direct opposition
to that of the Sadducees in order to prevent the masses from joining the
ranks of the latter. In fact, we see that the differences between the
two sects, mentioned in the Talmud, were as to minor things which have
very little to do with religious dogmas. We also have proved at the end
of Tract Sabbath of our new edition, from page 381 on, that all the
eighteen precautionary measures adopted by the Pharisees at the attic of
Hananiah, were directed against the priests who mostly belonged to the
Sadducees.

We do not mean to rebuke the Pharisees for having acted thus, for they
did so of necessity, because the Sadducees endeavored to transplant
Hellenism into the Hebrew religion in such a manner that it should not
be noticed, and in order to guard against this they opposed the
decisions of the Sadducees even when the latter were not contrary to
thee true teachings of the Torah, for (Ps. cxix. 126): "It is time to
act for the Lord: they have broken thy law."

It is very probable that because the belief in resurrection was so
deeply rooted among the masses, because it is very natural that cue
should desire to meet again his relatives alive after they

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

had once died, and the Sadducees have opposed this belief and ridiculed
it, the Pharisees assigned so much importance to it and endeavored to
find some source for it in the Scripture, in order to prevent the names
from adhering to the teachings of the Sadducees and thereby preventing
the transplanting of Hellenism into the Hebrew faith, although in the
very beginning of its development this belief was kept secret from the
masses.

The result of what has been stated is that the Sadducees as well as the
Pharisees, have expounded the Scripture according to tradition and have
believed in the immortality of the soul and retribution after death. And
the animosity of those two sects grew from the desire of each of them to
have the control over political affairs. Therefore, when the Pharisees
in the end gained the overhand, the first thing for Simeon b. Shetah to
do was to remove the Sadducees from the Sanhedrin, in which he was very
successful. But after the quarrel was carried on for several centuries,
and almost during the whole time of the existence of the second Temple,
and during that time more than once the danger was imminent that the
teachings of the Pharisees should be swallowed up by Hellenism, and
especially so during the time of Johanan the high priest and king,
during whose reign the Pharisees were executed by the hundreds, and many
emigrated to Egypt and Babylonia, the animosity and hatred assumed such
proportions that the name "Sadducee" alone was contemptible. Still more,
when after the Pharisees had already been successful they were compelled
to have public debates with them in religious matters, for their
teachings have been deeply rooted among the masses and could not easily
be rooted out.

This animosity assumed still greater proportions when Christianity began
to develop; for the latter has confirmed many of the teachings of the
Sadducees, although not directly still indirectly, and has opposed those
of the Pharisees, although they did not differ to a considerable extent
from the latter in religious matters and principles, the masses adhering
to the teachings of the Pharisees, have greatly despised the Sadducees,
and considered them infidels and disbelievers in retribution and
immortality of the soul, and in the appearing of a personal Messiah from
the houses of David and Joseph, which belief has been circulating among
the masses during the last days of existence of the second Temple, and
they endeavored, with all their might, to obliterate their teachings.
Those few Sadducees who lived after the destruction of the second Temple
gathered up all the courage they could and entered into public debates
with R. Johanan b. Zakkai,

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> R. Jose, etc., but
seeing that their hope was forlorn, and that they would not be able to
rise again, they gave up the battle publicly, although they did not
renounce their beliefs, or abandon their hatred, and tried to continue
the same against the teachings of the Pharisees secretly. At least,
during the second century we hear nothing of them publicly.

Now we will stop for a moment to see who the Karaite sect was. There is
no doubt that there existed a sect by this name in the days of the
Talmudists, for they are mentioned several times in the Talmud under the
name "Adherers to the Scripture," (‏בנימקרא‎), and in one place it is
plainly stated "the Karaites added" (Pesachim, p. 117; our edition, p.
246, see foot note 3). Neither is there any doubt that they were not
favored by the Talmudists, as we find in many places in the Talmud
remarks reflecting on them, as *f.i.*: "They who occupy themselves with
the study of Scripture are not to be blamed, but, on the other hand, not
to be praised" (Baba Metzia, 79), and in Hagiga, it states plainly; Rabh
said: "If a man goes out from the study of the Mishna to read the verses
of the Bible, this man can have no more peace." And there is no doubt
that many similar remarks found in the Talmud have reference to this
sect. But we can not, with exactness, fix the time when and to what
extent this sect openly declared against the teachings of the
Talmudists. However, we do not hesitate for one moment to state that
during all that time this sect has brooded an intense hatred to every
Israelite who has not followed them, although at times they were
compelled to conceal their hatred.

One penetrating glance into the history of the Samaritans and into that
of the Karaites; one penetrating glance into the literature of the
former and into that of the latter; the curses pronounced by both of
those sects against the followers of the Rabbanism; the beliefs and
principles common to the religion of both (although differing slightly
ceremonially), will suffice to induce one to agree with us that the
Karaites, whose sect was established in the days of Anan, and a few of
whom are living in our own time, have not only borrowed from the
Samaritans their teachings, but that the Karaites are the former
Samaritans and that even up to date they have changed slightly only in
their outward appearance and in name, but not intrinsically.

From the whole sect we will pick out only Anan, who descended from the
family of the Exilarch, who came from the house of David (and perhaps
was his mother or grandmother of Samaritan descent), and who, from
jealously having scorned and despised

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

the traditional teachings, had gathered the remainder of the Samaritans,
who had long ago changed their name and tendency, had become their chief
to fight their battles and to separate completely from the house of
Israel, for he could afford doing so, being a descendant from a
prominent family. But we do not in the least intimate that Anan founded
a new sect with new principles.

This, our present view, is not unfounded, but is based on historical
facts, for we do not find anywhere in history any such intense,
unchangeable, everlasting and unfounded hatred as that of the Samaritans
and Karaites toward the house of Israel.

Whenever we find in history that any ill-feelings or hatred existed
between two nations it is easy to find the reason for such feelings or
hatred; it was either the craving for subjugation of foreign countries,
or the desire to reign supreme over others, or, in very ancient times
also the desire to prove the supremacy of one nation's idols over those
of the other, and many other reasons, which provoked one nation to go to
war with another and to take vengeance of one another. But we find no
such reason for the hatred of the Samaritans toward the house of Israel,
yet when the latter returned from Babylonia and intended to build the
Temple, no plausible reason can be found for the endeavoring of the
Samaritans to mislead the Israelites whenever they tried to establish
the new moon. (See Rosh Hashana, Chap. II., our Hebrew edition, p. 25;
English, p. 38.) Neither can there be assigned a reason for the custom
of the Samaritans to pronounce curses over Ezra the Scribe, at the time
of the opening of the ark of scrolls every Sabbath, which prevails up to
date. (See our "The Pentateuch, its Character," etc., as well as for
many other things which the reader may find in the Talmud and Apokrypha,
and in Graetz's History of the Jews, which, if quoted here would occupy
a full volume.) In a word, there can be found no substantial reason or
ground for these things, except that they blindly hated the house of
Israel. Neither do we find any reason for the slandering and reviling by
the Karaites of the Rabbanism in general, and of Rabh Saadiah Gaon in
particular, nor for all the false accusations and malicious charges and
denunciations against the Rabbanism. contained in the extensive
literature of the Karaites.

History shows us that nations who hated each other to the extreme have
in course of time laid the weapons aside and made up. History records
numerous instances, that sects between whom differences existed, and
which even reached such a degree that they resulted in actual fight,
have in course of time become reconciled and associated with each other,
and intermarried, and the former

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

hatred and quarrels were wholly forgotten. We will not cite as an
example the Beth Shammai and the Beth Hillel, who, although widely
differing from each other in their opinions, still intermarried, as
found in the Talmud; but even the Sadducees and the Pharisees, did they
there decline to eat and drink with each other, or intermarry? We do not
find that anywhere. <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) The Samaritans,
however, and Karaites are singular instances in this respect in history.
Although most of them have already intermingled with other nations, not
a single instance can be pointed out that they have intermarried with an
Israelite or have partaken of his food or drink.

The toleration of the Pharisees and of their teachings is well known.
The disciples of the Beth Hillel have done all that lay in their power
to bring them into the house of Israel: they credited them in regard to
purification; they permitted them to be counted in the number of three
for the benediction over the meal (‏זיטון‎) and in the number of ten for
prayer in the prayer house (‏מנין עשרה‎) and in fact, wanted to consider
them as Israelites for all purposes, but their animosity and trickery
increased to such an extent that they could no more be tolerated, and
therefore, the leaders of Israel were compelled to regard them in all
respects as idolators, and prohibited their bread, wine, and oil.
Exactly the same thing happened with the Karaites whom the Rabbanism
endeavored, with all their might, to draw near them and debate with
them, until they convinced themselves that their hatred toward Israel is
so great that they said "‏הקרעים אינן מתאחין לעולם‎"(the rents will
never be sewed together), "the Karaites will never make up with us," and
they are up to date regarded as idolators.

We know well that we are too brief in this article and that we ought to
adduce at length all the facts to prove that all that the Samaritans and
Karaites have done unto Israel was not to derive any benefit therefrom,
or with a view of subduing them, for they

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

well knew that this was an impossibility, but only out of blind hatred
deeply rooted in them, which descends from generation to generation. We
know this very well, but we can not enter here into such details, as it
would exceed the limits of an article, and would comprise a whole book
in itself. We, therefore, rely upon the intelligence and knowledge of
the reader that be will know where to find those if needed.

Even in our own times, when the Karaites number only a few thousands,
which accounts for their enjoying equal rights with the natives, since
Emperor Nicholas of Russia, they make no secret of their hatred toward
Israel. When the anti-Jewish disorders broke out in Russia some few
years ago, and many of our co-religionists were exiled from the Middle
States of the Russian Empire, the latter have petitioned the Russian
Government to be permitted to embrace Karaitism. The Minister of the
Interior has expressed his willingness to grant their petition if the
Karaites will consent to receive them into their midst, and directed an
inquiry to this effect to their Hacham in *Odessa*, but the latter
answered that there is no desire on the part of the Karaites to receive
the Jews as their co-religionists.

These facts need hardly any comment; they speak for themselves. In fact,
during all the long period since the year 760, it has not as yet
happened that even a few individual Karaites should intermarry with our
co-religionists, or should in any way associate with us. (Even in
business affairs they do it only with great reluctance and very seldom.)
Is there any stronger proof necessary of this race-hatred? No other race
or nation, no matter how great their hatred may be, will ever decline to
receive into their midst a Jew, if he only wishes to gain their faith,
and will never refuse to associate with him; and the masses, as well as
the intelligent classes, have always been favorably inclined toward the
Jews. But this hatred of the Karaites has no equal among other nations
in any generation.

As the Samaritans have forged and falsified the Pentateuch, as is now
well established, so also did the Karaites forge and falsify the Talmud.
And we hereby reproach the writers of the history of the Karaites, who
without much deliberations wrote; For Saadiah the Gaon, when king,
unable to assign any good reason for a statement found in the Talmud
(Jerushalmi), that the Beth Shammai have killed some of the Beth Hillel,
and *vice versa*, has denied the existence of such a statement at all;
and Sahl, the son of Matzliah, his opponent, in order to prove to the
world the delinquency of R. Saadiah, has descended from Palestine to
Babylonia with the

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

Jerusalem Talmud in his hand! And they did not conceive that Sahl
himself has forged the manuscript of the Talmud by writing in this
statement, and he was not the first one to do so, but was probably
preceded by others, as we have remarked in the introduction to our
edition of Rosh Hoshana. In fact, we are surprised at those who are
handling the Karaite literature that they have not perceived it. Why
should more evidence be given to Sahl the forger, than to Rabh Saadiah,
who states positively that such a statement did not exist in the Talmud?
Why should we not [believe](errata.htm#37.md) R. Saadiah that in his
manuscript such a statement was not in existence? (To our regret this
statement was added to, and remains in the Talmud through the fault of
the printers.) Especially so that even now in our own days the Karaites
continue to forge and falsify, as proved by many modern scholars at the
head of which is Abraham Harkawy, by exposing the falsifications of
Abraham Firkowitz, the Karaite Hacham, in all his writings.

The result of all that stated is that from the similarity of action, in
all details, of the Karaites and Samaritans we can logically arrive at
the conclusion that the Karaites were doing nothing new, but only
stepping in the shoes of their ancestors, the Samaritans, who they were,
only under a different name, and being so they never descended from
Israel. And all that Anan did was to gather the scattered Samaritans and
encourage them to continue their fight against Israel, which has been
hitherto conducted by them secretly, openly and publicly and with more
vigor and animosity.

And if we will examine with a critical eye the literature of the
Karaites we will easily see that they are none others than the
Samaritans. And in vain has Dr. Holdheim held up as a striking proof the
"laws of divorce," saying that such were the opinions of the Sadducees,
and that the Karaites who were none else but the Sadducees clung to
their old laws. No divorce was granted under the teaching of the
Samaritans, unless on the ground of adultery. And as to this also the
Talmud bears testimony in stating (as quoted above), "The Beth Shammai
are as the Kuthaiz, *i.e.*, the Beth Shammai who prohibited a divorce
unless on the ground of adultery, agree with the Samaritans who taught
the same thing, and so also are the laws of the Karaites (even in regard
to this has Dr. Holdheim blamed the teachings of the Pharisees without
any foundation, for formerly even the Pharisees did not allow a divorce
unless on the above-stated grounds, and all the leniency as to divorce
which was afterwards decreed by the Beth Hillel, of whom R. Aqiba was
one, was only introduced because the exigencies of the time required it,
for it was at the time the New Testament

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

began to gain strength and become popular, which declared every one who
married a divorced woman to be an adulterer; as proved by I. H. Weiss in
his work, and all other laws of the Karaites"). The strict observance of
the Sabbath, etc., is nothing else but the laws of the Samaritans, and
the slight difference in the ceremonies of these two sects is only
because the former lived much later than the latter, and had to struggle
with other sects who were their superiors, and to submit to them, and
therefore many ceremonies were forgotten altogether. As to principles
and dogmas, we have never heard that the Samaritans have ever rejected
the belief in resurrection or in the world to come. On the contrary, as
the belief in resurrection has circulated among all nations, and as the
Samaritans have produced no great and learned men, and being widely
separated from Israel, it is very natural that they did believe in
resurrection as did their descendants the Karaites.

Another proof can be adduced that the Karaites are the descendants of
the Samaritans; namely, that the Karaites mourn much more over the
destruction of the Temple (and some of their Hachams have even adapted
the name "Mourner" or "Mourners"), than we do, because, as the
Samaritans they mourn over the loss of their temple on the Mount Gerisim
which was destroyed by Janai, and continue to curse him up to date in
their prayers.

We could adduce numerous other proofs taken from both the extensive
literature of the Karaites and the inextensive literature of the
Samaritans, to show that we did not in the least exaggerate our opinion
as to the origin of the Karaites, but this article has taken up much
more space than we expected and we are unable to give them here to the
reader.

Before closing this article we find it our duty to answer the gentleman
who put the question to us: "What are the reformers of our times, if not
Karaites?"

A careful examination of the literature of the reformers in Europe, as
Holdheim, Geiger, Ritter, etc.; of the prayer books of the reformers in
this country, and of the sermons of their preachers all over the world,
we will at once recognize in them the early Sadducees, with all their
particularities. They (generally, not considering here and there an
exception) believe in immortality of the soul, in retribution after
death and in many Talmudical traditions, as can be shown by the fact
that they observe the holidays as established by the Talmudists; but
they do not believe in resurrection, neither in the coming of a personal
Messiah, and do not recognize the Talmud as final authority in all
matters; and self-understood those rules and regulations established
subsequent to the

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

close of the Talmud but in its spirit, the same thing did the former
Sadducees.

But as our present reformers are descendants of the Pharisees, and the
Sadducees being no more in existence, therefore they also have in many
things adopted a new form, and recognize the teachings of the Pharisees
(as for instance the observance of the sixth day of Sivan as Pentecost)
as indisputable laws. But we can by no means accuse the reformers in not
believing in tradition generally, as we cannot well accuse of that the
former Sadducees. (Even those reformers who have changed the Sabbath,
for even this can be explained in accordance with the general rule of
the Talmud which sanctifies the seventh day, but not the Sabbath itself,
and for this reason the Talmud decreed that in case one forgets which
day is the Sabbath, he shall count six days and observe the seventh as
Sabbath, see our article in the Deborah, 1894.) Should the reader put
the question to us whether the reformers are not to be charged with
transplanting Christianity into Judaism, and whether there is no danger
that in course of time Christianity will swallow up Judaism altogether,
as the Unitarism of our own days, as such danger has already threatened
Judaism during the early Sadducees, we will say that this question
requires a deliberate answer, and cannot be answered by "yes" or "no"
offhand.

We can only state that we have devoted much of our attention to this
question, and with a penetrating eye have followed the work of the
reformers of the School of Holdheim, Ritter and their companions, in
Berlin, of the school of Isaac Wise in Cincinnati, and of the teaching
of Emil G. Hirch in Chicago, and having collected considerable data of
their past, and having bestowed much deliberation upon their future, we
consider ourselves competent to give our opinion about Otis matter. In
fact we have prepared a long article dealing specially with the
following questions: (1) Does the Hebrew religion require any reforms?
(2) If it does, what are they and on what basis can we introduce them?
(3) What are the re. reforms introduced by the conservative reformers,
and what are those of the radical reformers? (4) What benefit resulted
from these reforms in general and in particular? (5) The result of the
reforms of Cincinnati and of those of Hirch, and (6) What is the meaning
of the name "Orthodox," and to whom shall it be applied? This article we
are willing to submit to the readers (after accomplishing our task of
the translation) if desired.

verbatim from Mamar Haishuth.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[143:1](ht124.htm#fr_19.md) It is well known that
the Karaites make Anan's life date 100 years earlier than in reality,
*i.e.*, 4400. But S. L. Rapoport, in his "Kerem Chemed," p. 203, has
explained and proved their mistake, from the testimony of Sherira the
Gaon, and the "Book of Tradition," by Abraham b. David, that Anan rose
in the age of Jehuda the Gaon, who was a Gaon from 4516 to 4529 1/2.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[144:1](ht124.htm#fr_20.md) Page 122, Holdheim's
opinion.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[156:1](ht124.htm#fr_21.md) An example may be given
of the last century when a new sect (*Chasidim*) established themselves.
The greatest authority, at least in Russia and Poland, Eliah Wilna,
called the "Wilner Gaon" in conjunction with all the Rabbis,
excommunicated the whole sect, prohibited their eatings and beverages
and intermarriage with them. Moreover he allowed any one to denounce the
new sect, and their rabbis were imprisoned by the government. But what
was the end? Nothing at all. All the excommunications, prohibitions,
prosecutions, etc., were abolished, without even the result of a
meeting, and as soon as the quarrel was over, not one of either party
hesitated to mingle with the opposite sect. All are called Israel, all
are Israelites, and at the present time nobody gives any attention to
all that happened then.
