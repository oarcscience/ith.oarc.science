# PART V.

THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE SIX SECTIONS IN THEIR SIXTY TRACTS.

Section Zeraim (Plants) contains eleven tractates, viz.: Berachoth
(Benediction), supplied with Gemara, both Palestinian and Babylonian,
Peah (Corner tithe), Dmai (Uncertain), Khilayim (Mixtures), Shebüt
(Sabbatical year), Therumoth (Heave offering), Maasheroth (Tithes),
Maaser Sheni (Second tithes), Chala (Dough), Orla (Fruit trees during
the first three years), and Biccurim (First fruit), all of which are not
supplied with Babylonian Gemara. The laws of all of them concern
Palestine at that time the Temple was in existence.

Section Nashim (Women) contains seven tracts, viz.: Yebamoth (Levirate
marriage), Khethuboth (Marriage contracts), Nedarim. (Vows), Nazir
(Nazarite), Sota (Suspicious women), Gittin (Divorces), Kiddushin
(Betrothals).

Section Kodashim (Holiness), eleven tracts: Zebachim (Sacrifices),
Menachoth (Meal-offering), Chulin (Profane things), Bechoroth (First
born), Arachin (Estimations), Themura (Exchange), Kherithoth
(Excisions), Me-ila (Trespass), Thamid (Daily offerings), Middoth
(Measurements) and Kinnim (Birds' nests). All the above tracts, besides
Chulin, treat about sacrifices, offerings used at the time of the
Temple. Chulin, however, speaks of the laws of slaughtering and of the
meats that may be used.

Section Tcharoth (Purification), twelve tracts, viz.: Khelim (Vessels),
Ohaloth (Tents), Nego-im (Leprosy), Parah (Heifer), Teharoth
(Purification), Mikvaoth (Wells), Nidda (Menstruous), Mach-shirim
(Preparations), Zabim (Running issues), Tebul-Yom (Legal-day bath),
Yadayim (Hands), and Uktzin (Stalks of fruit); to all of them, except
Nidda, there is no Gemara, for the reason stated above (Vol. II., p.
42). The tract Nidda, however, treats about women menstruous and all the
laws of sexual intercourse.

Section Moed (Festivals), twelve tracts (in our Edition 13), and Section
Nezikin (Jurisprudence), ten tracts (in our Edition 13), which are
already published in the English language. We give, for the benefit of
readers, the following synopsis:

Note by redactor: Since the synopses which follow are simply duplicates
of the material at the front of each the separate volumes they have been
