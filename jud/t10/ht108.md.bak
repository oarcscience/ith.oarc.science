# CHAPTER V.

THE TALMUD OF JERUSALEM, THE TALMUD OF BABYLONIA, THE CHARACTER OF THEIR
HALAKHA AND HAGADA, THE DATES OF THEIR COMPLETION AND THEIR
SYSTEMATIZATION.

The sages of the Gemara, called Amaraim, and the commentators of
Mishnayoth were of different characters. Some were intent only on
diligently collecting Mishnayoth and Baraithoth, wherever found, to
compare them with each other, to correct their reading in conformity
with Rabbi's Mishnayoth, and to separate the wheat from the chaff,
*i.e.* to decide which Boraithoth was valid and which was not worthy of
consideration (Boraithoth which were not studied in the colleges of R.
Hyya and R. Ushia were not considered). On the other hand, there were
others who devoted themselves to ingenious construction of the
Mishnayoth and the Boraithoth itself, without adducing proofs from
elsewhere. (See App. No. 9.) This consisted in scrupulously examining
the letters in the Mishna, to eliminate or to amplify it where they
judged necessary, to trace laws to their origin and to discover what
tana agreed with this Mishna and what differed from it, whether the same
tana contradicted himself at different places, and whether it was
incompatible

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

to explain them in various ways, and the like. In the language of the
Gemara they are distinguished by different titles. Those who studied the
Mishnayoth were styled "Sinai, the master of the wheat," and the
dialecticians "the uprooters of mountains" or "acute men"; and although
the preference was given to the former, as it was said, "all must resort
to the master of the wheat," yet the study of the Babylonian Talmudists
being based on scholasticism, their acuteness is evinced in their so
harmonizing the contradictions and disagreements, that they appear to
point to the same meaning.

Not only did they interpret the Boraithas at variance with the
Mishnayoth, but when even one of the great Amoraim appeared to differ
from the Mishna they so distorted the latter that it should seem to
agree with the Amora. A similar difference existed among the authors of
the Hagada; some gave to biblical texts a new reading remote from the
plain meaning, interpreting them in strange and marvellous ways, and
basing on them legends of natural impossibilities, while some adhered
closely to the literal meaning of texts, without adorning them with
exaggerations. Though in the Palestinian and the Syrian, as well as in
the Babylonian colleges, there were many scholars who assisted each
other in their studies and comments on the Mishnayoth, the Palestinian
differed from those of Babylon in this respect, that in the former the
chief labor consisted in the collection of Halakhas, without profound
researches into the deeper meanings and implications, even in the study
of the mere Mishnayoth, all of which was totally unlike the manner of
study in the Babylonian schools. Indeed, the Palestinians were inferior
to the Babylonians in scholastic profundity and ingenuity, and but few
of them distinguished themselves therein, except R. Johanan, R. Simeon
b. Lakish, and several others of that period. Therefore, in the schools
of Palestine, scholasticism was esteemed of little value, and in them
the study of Halakhas fell into decay, so that finally the Hagada came
to occupy the principal place, the Halakhas holding a subordinate
position. In addition to this, they found themselves compelled to give
their attention to the biblical texts, as the Messianists, who had grown
in numbers, construed these texts favorably to Christianity, and
challenged the Jews to dispute with them. Therefore, the sages found
themselves obliged to give the preference

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

to the study of the Scriptures and Hagada. As at that time the
impression was general that the most important element in the study of
the Torah is ingenious reasoning on Halakha, it is not surprising that
the Babylonian Talmud came to be received as the important and essential
part of the Oral Law, while that of Palestine held a subordinate
position.

It is difficult to describe accurately and clearly the mode of thinking
and ways of reasoning of the Talmud, which in truth is known only to one
who has made it the study of his life. It is easier, however, to give a
picture of the Talmudists' views and notions. as gathered from the
Hagada. In this respect the Hagada of the Palestinian Talmud is superior
to that of Babylon, as it had its birth in Palestine, and was borrowed
thence by the Babylonians.

Many books of Hagada had existed in Palestine, whose contents were
incorporated later in various Midrashim, and some also in the Talmud,
and even at that period there was a difference of opinion as to their
value. Some valued them, and some despised them. The Hagadas consist of
two elements: first, the external garment of the thought, the tradition,
and secondly, the internal idea, allegorically shadowed forth, which
constitutes literary value. The latter can be divided into three kinds:
"P'shat," the interpretation of the meaning of biblical words; "Drash,"
a free untrammelled interpretation of the scriptural texts; "Sod," the
deep mystic, religious meanings construed from the texts. By these three
kinds of construction of Scripture, all subjects, topics and times are
embraced and discussed. The Hagada, with its mystic and veiled religious
wisdom, has exercised a great influence in the Oriental and heathen
world, which has borrowed from it many precious gems of profound
religious thought having Palestine for their birthplace. And indeed we
find that the multitude of legends based on the Bible which have been
current in, and reverenced by, the Mohammedan world for twelve hundred
years, delighting both sages and the unlearned, are to be found in the
Talmudic Hagada. Whether entire or only in the leading idea, their
identity is recognizable. Many also of the legends of the Middle Ages to
be found in the works of Dante, or those of Boccaccio, Cervantes, and
Milton, are taken, consciously or unconsciously, from their original
source, the Talmudic Hagada.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Fathers of the
Christian church have likewise drawn on it, as Basilius of Cappadocia,
Hieronymus, Chrysostomus, and many others who construed passages in the
Bible in accordance with the Hagada. The moral code contained in the
Hagada, teaches man how to conduct himself toward all men and in all
situations of life. We shall deal with this moral law in a future
chapter on the Ethics of the Talmud.

The two Talmuds contain, then, Halakhas, Hagadas, references to all
branches of science known in those days, but without any system or
order. Many times a Hagada is interpolated in the middle of a Halakha,
and again in like manner a digression on a scientific subject extraneous
to the Halakha is inserted in it. The compiler of the Talmud, whether
from careless method or from the great labor involved, could introduce
no order. In this respect there is little difference between the two
Talmuds; nor is there much difference in the sources whence each drew
its material. Sayings from the Talmud of Palestine are quoted in that of
Babylonia, sometimes under the name of their author or their citer in
Babylonia; other passages are stated to emanate from the "West." "In the
West (Palestine) it was said." In the Talmud Palestinian, similarly
(*vide* I. H Weiss, Vol. III., 127, etc.), the Babylonian authority is
often given; *e.g.*, "*There* they learn" or "say." It is clear however
that when the Babylonian Talmud was compiled that of Palestine was
unknown to its compilers, although, according to the opinion of many,
the Talmud of Palestine was arranged by R. Johanan and concluded by R.
Jose bar Bun about one hundred years before the Babylonian; others,
however, affirm that the Talmud of Palestine was concluded only in the
eighth century or even as late as the ninth (in the time of Anan, the
founder of the Karaite sect), and adduce evidence in substantiation. We
may assume, as a compromise, both assertions to be true; the greater
part had indeed been arranged and systematized in the time of Hillel,
the last of the Nasis in the West, but it was not employed to any extent
in the colleges remaining in Palestine and Syria, because the Babylonian
Talmud had spread until it reached the West. But in the time of the
Karaites many things were added to the Talmud of Palestine (to oppose
the doctrines of the Karaites, as the small tract on Tephilin and the
like, which that sect repudiated) by those who wished their

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

words to be held as of equal sacredness with the Talmud, as was then
customary. (We shall speak of this further on.) The bulk of the
Palestine Talmud, after all the additions, is much less than that of the
Babylonian, albeit it contains Gemara on two additional tracts
(thirty-nine instead of thirty-seven, as will be explained) and
fragmentary chapters of other tracts. This is owing to the fact that the
discussion of the Mishnayoth is not so elaborate, and there is less of
scholastics. We have already stated that its quality, as regards the
Halakhas, is also inferior. It was not as popular as that of Babylonia,
therefore fewer copies were made of it than of the latter. For this
reason, since its conclusion its opponents have been less numerous,
though it was very much persecuted at the time when it was studied in
the colleges. The government rulers persecuted Israel and its Torah,
since the death of Rabhi, and the persecutions did not stop until the
death of Hillel, the last of his descendants, with whom the office of
Nasi ceased to exist (360). This was alone one of the causes why the
Talmud of Palestine spread less widely than its younger brother of
Babylonia. The lot of the Talmud in Babylonia was better, since from the
time of the death of Rabbi (223) till Mar b. R. Rah Ashi, one of the
last of the Amoraim (500), it was not persecuted by the Persian rulers.
For about a hundred years, the heads of the Exile were diligent in their
studies, uniting thereunto its political power. If it sometimes happened
that some kings were ill-disposed to the Jews, still they did not
interfere with their studies. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) For this
reason the study of the Talmud flourished in the colleges of Sura,
Nahardea and Pumbeditha, and the number of its students was counted by
thousands. (The Talmud counts the auditors of Abba Arikha's \[Rabb's\]
lectures as 12,000.) And so the Talmud became a vast sea, and its waves
rose with might. R. Ashi (355-427) saw, therefore, that the time had
come for revising, systematizing and concluding it, when he came to
restore the college of Sura (Matha Mekhasia), which had fallen into
decay on the death of Rabh.

About this R. Ashi it was said (Sanhedrin, p. 108) that from the time of
Rabbi to his time there is not to be found a man who was unique in the
possession of wisdom, riches and glory. He

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

was in favor with King Izgadar II., rich and long-lived. Therefore, he
undertook in the course of one year to systematize two tracts. Whether
he arranged them in the order in which they are found in the Mishnayoth,
or differently, or whether he revised and improved them, is not known to
us; but this, at least, is clear, that some tracts he revised twice, and
the second time in a manner opposite to the first. <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) Be this as it may, it is also certain that
the Talmud which we possess is not that which came from R. Ashi's hands,
since additions by seven heads of the colleges who succeeded him in
Sura, and by their colleagues, Meremar, Idi bar Abin, Nabman bar Huna,
Tabyomi (Mar b. R. Ashi) his son, Rabba Tosphoah, Rabina bar Huna,
Rabbana Jose, who presided together 125 years, are mentioned in the
Talmud, none of which are found in R. Ashi's edition. Perhaps they also
made eliminations in his edition though they did not attain the learning
and religious wisdom of R. Ashi, except his son, Tabyomi. The latter
filled the place of his father in learning and wisdom, though not in his
breadth of view, for in his time reigned King Peros, the son of Izgadar
III., who persecuted the Jews, the Talmud, and those who cherished it.
Therefore, even if we suppose that his son Mar was diligent in arranging
and revising the Talmud, as traces of his insertions and corrections are
found in it, yet he did not succeed in completing it, owing to the
persecutions of the government, especially as he did not occupy his
office long, and thus the Talmud has remained uncorrected. But as the
sages became aware that the times were changing, the number of learned
men diminishing, they began to fear lest in the course of time, passages
would multiply in the Talmud which would rather detract from than add to
its value; therefore they concluded it, and decreed that thenceforth
nothing should be added to it. They also ordered that the sages should
no more be called "Amoraim." (signifying commentators of the Mishna),
but Saburaim (*i.e.*, explainers of the Talmud to the people). Thus the
Talmud was concluded in the age of Rabbana Jose (about 525), without
further revision or rearranging. In reality, however, these sages
achieved almost nothing; for, despite their decree, the Soburites (as
also many of its enemies) as well as the Gaonim, and the

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

rabbis succeeding them, added to and eliminated from it and altered in
many places its version, as 1. H. Weiss has proved beyond dispute and
also we ourselves in our book "L'baker Mishpat" and in the journal
"Hakol" many times, as will be mentioned further on. (See App. No. 10.)
