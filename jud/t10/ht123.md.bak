------------------------------------------------------------------------

# APPENDIX A.

No. 1. In the history of the "Oral Law," Part I., by I. H. Weiss, the
reader will find an account of the deeds of the Samaritans in detail,
though only a few instances are dealt with.

No. 2. We may refer the reader to the book, "Maamar Haishuth," by
Holdheim, Berlin, who explains the belief of the Sadducees, and their
opposition to the Pharisees.

No. 3. We agree with those who say that the tearing of the skin at the
performance of circumcision was discovered since the Israelites had
begun to undo circumcision; at the time when the theatres were opened by
Nero, and the Jews who had to go naked there to wrestle with the beasts,
were ashamed to be distinguished by this peculiarity. For this purpose
the tearing of the skin was devised. (See Tract Sabbath, p. 307, in the
Mishna: "One who was circumcised without having had the skin torn open
is considered uncircumcised.") To this there is neither any source in
the Scriptures nor any tradition mentioned in the Gemara. Some scholars
don't agree with us. (See the letter of A. Bernstein in Tract
Roshhoshonah, in the first edition). We, however, base our opinion on
the fact that we doubt whether Antiochus Epiphanes would have prohibited
a circumcision, customary then among the neighboring nations; and
therefore it seems to us that he prohibited only the tearing of the skin
which had been ordained by the Pharisees.

No. 4. See our brief introduction in Tract Sabbath. Our opinion is that
some written Mishnayoth had been in existence long before. Also
*Jellinek's Kuntres Haklalim*, Note 4, for the opinion of the French and
Spanish scholars about it. Also I. H. Weiss and our "Hakol," Vol. VI.,
p. 11.

The London Athenæum, VI., 808, has cited our statement in the general
brief introduction, p. 15: "Most of the Mishnayoth date from a very
early period, and originated with the students of the Jewish Academies
which existed since the days of Jehoshaphat, King of Judah \[2 Chron.
xxii., 9\]: 'And they thought in Judah, and with them was the book of
the law of the Lord, and they moved about through all the cities of
Judah and taught the people,'" as ridiculous. This, however, does not
terrify us, as notes of commentaries on the text of the Scriptures, the
whole or in part, have

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

been found in the hands of students from the time colleges had, been
founded; and this opinion of ours has met with approval from many
contemporary scholars.

No. 5. See our "Hakol," Vol. VI., in which we state that the Gentiles
who desired to embrace Judaism, asking Hillel to convert them, were men
of rank, for a common man would not dare to make such a stipulation as
to be a high priest in Israel.

No. 6. The belief in the divinity of Jesus became acute at a much, later
period, when the heathens accepted this fight according to all modem
scholars. <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md)

No. 7. (See App. No. 4.) We shall also come to this matter in our later
notes.

No. 8. In our translation we have added the Tract Ebel Rabbathi, or
Sema'Hoth, as the law of mourning was taken from this, tract. We have,
therefore, added it to the tract "Minor Festivals," which also treats of
mourning on the festival days. What concerns the beginning of "Section
of Seeds" with the tract "Benedictions,", see I. H. Weiss for another
reason which does not seem probable, to us.

The names of all the treatises of the tracts of each section, and, of
their chapters in detail, the reader will find in books written, for
this purpose by Strack, Mielziner, and also in the encyclopædias,
especially in the Jewish Encyclopædia. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_12.md) We deem it not necessary to name them here
as we give at the end of Vol II. the synopsis of each tract, translated
and published up to date.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

No. 9. Details will be given in the second volume of this book in the
introduction to our new edition.

No. 10. In our book mentioned, we also show additions made by the
opponents of the Talmud for the purpose of degrading it. For examples,
see Vol. II., Part III. <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md)

No. 11. We shall come to this matter in the second volume of this book,
in the chapter devoted to the Ethics of the Talmud.

No. 12. Almost all ritual poets composed after the Talmudic Hagada.
Sometimes comments will be found, by a critical eye, there on the Hagada
or even Halakha, as the ritual poems relating to Passover, contain
almost all the laws of Passover.

No. 13. His decree was only for the German, French and Polish Jews, and
extended only until the end of the five thousandth years after creation.
However, the above-named Jews accepted his decree as extending
indefinitely. In Syria and in Palestine, however, where his decree was
not accepted, some of the Portuguese Jews, known there as Franks, marry
two wives even at the present time in such cases when the first wife is
barren.

No. 14. See "Measseph Nidachim," Vol. X., by A. E. Harkavy, where he
proves that in Spain had existed houses of learning from ancient times
and that the Gaonim of Babylonia had relations with them; and in many
places they tried to follow their customs. (See there).

No. 15. As to what were these places, and who the disputants,

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

whether only Messianists or also Persians and idolaters, the opinions of
modern scholars differ. To us it seems that the Messianists possessed
only the house of Abidan, and the Persians and Magians that of
Nitzraphi. Rabh refused absolutely to dispute with the first, but was
forced to do so with the latter, perhaps by his proximity to the
government. Of the house of Abiani scholars say it was composed of
Messianists.

No. 16. As his interpretation of the text, "it shall be a sign unto thee
upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thy eyes," that it is a figure
of speech, it shall be memored as if written on thy hand, as, "set me as
a seal upon thy breast," \[Song of Solomon, vii. 6\]: "between thy
eyes," as an ornament which it is customary to put on the brow, and
there is no mention of the use of Phylacteriens in his whole commentary,
though the Talmud based the custom of Phylacteriens only on these texts.
We have spoken already of this in our work on Phylacteriens.

No. 17. In the excellent work, "Kritische Geschichte der Talmud
Übersetzungen," by Dr. Erich Bischof, we read, p. 67: Trotzdem heute der
frühr überschätzte Eisenmenger allzusehr unterschätzt wird, weil er noch
nicht den historisch--Kritischen Blick unserer Tage besass lässt sich
doch gegen seine--Übersetzunger der genanten <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) Stellen nichts Erhebliches mit Fug
einwenden sie sind vielmehr fast stets richtig, etc.

We may say that though we respect very much the above-mentioned work as
one whose opinions in general are correct, we would like to call the
attention of the learned author to the following facts:

(*a*) Notwithstanding the fact that in a period of eight centuries over
a thousand persons of varying opinions were engaged in the compiling of
the Talmud, in the edition lying before us there is not to be found any
designation as to time, and in many places, even the author of that
saying is not mentioned, Eisenmenger gives the sentence, calling it
literal translation, as if it were said by one person at a given time.
It is self-evident, however, that such literal translation changes the
meaning entirely.

(*b*) An opinion of an individual concerning Gentiles, he quotes it in
the name of the Talmud, in spite that this saying is immediately opposed
by the Gemara.

(*c*) He erred even in the literal translation, *e.g.*, "*Margela be
Pume de Abye*," this paragraph is translated by us in third part of Vol.
II. of this book. He translates, "A pearl was in the mouth of A."; while
the literal translation of the word Margela is, "It was used," *i.e.*,
Abye "used" to repeat this saying very often. At

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

another place he asks why should the "Talmud" be called great, while the
word "Talmud" in that sentence means "teaching," *i.e.*, the teaching is
greater than action; for teaching causes action. And we wonder how Dr.
Bischoff can say of such, "it is rather correct."

No. 18. Concerning the pamphlets and books against the Talmud, written
by apostate Jews, see Strack, page 95.

No. 19. Rohling declares that the Rabbis had concluded that all the sins
of a Jew, be it against heaven or against man, are forgiven him if he
only remains a Jew. He also declares that every Rabbi considers himself
infallible concerning the laws of non-Jewish blood.

The conclusion o our review of this book seems to us of interest to the
reader, and therefore we translate it here: "The Lord hath made all
things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil"
\[Proverbs, xvi. 4\]. If we will look with an open eye into the history
of Israel, we shall find that at all times, when characterless men arose
to accuse and oppress Jews because of jealousy or animosity (except in
cases where a man fights for his livelihood, which is natural), their
opponents who fought them openly were equal to them in every respect. As
the poet says, "Also unto thee, O Lord belongeth mercy for thou
renderest to every man according to his *deeds*" \[Ps. lxiv. 131. If
these words should be explained according to their literal meaning the
question would arise why *mercy* if to every one is rendered according
to his deeds. Therefore it is to be explained thus: "mercy belongeth to
thee that thou repayest the wicked man for his evil deeds by one who is
equal in *deeds* to him."

Similarly did it happen in the time of the judges when Sisera oppressed
the Jews terribly, providence transferred him to a prostitute, Jael, who
rebelled against her husband and also against her lover (Sisera), who
thought to be saved, being between her knees, and was slain by her
\[Judges, v. 27\].

Haman, the Agagi whom Harbonah had assisted in creating the gallows to
hang Mordecai, was transferred to Harbonah's hands and was hanged by him
who was equally devoid of character. Hadrian who decreed that the Jews
should not circumcise their children under the penalty of capital
punishment, and Simon b. 'Yohaie who was going to Rome to petition the
Caesar to abolish this decree, the miracle occurred through Ben Tmalion
(a devil). Notwithstanding that Simon wept saying, "To the servant of my
grandfather (Hagar), when she was in need, an angel appeared three times
\[Genesis, xvi. 7-12\], and to me who am troubled with the needs of all
Israel, an angel did not appear, even one time, but

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

only a devil" \[Me-ila, 17, b\], it did not help him, for who of the
angels would lower himself to appear before such a low person who
desires to oppress humanity without any reason but merely on account of
their religion.

In reality it is revealed before Him, who said a Word and the World was
created, that a man of delicate nature would dislike to come in contact
with men of doubtful character, and would not fight with a dirty man; as
there is a rule that he who fights bodily with a dirty man must become
dirty himself. Therefore the Lord has created the wicked and
characterless men for the purposes of such an evil day that he should
conquer his opponent, who is equal to him in every respect.

Our sages seem to be aware of this, as we find that when a dispute was
needed on subjects concerning Israel, they selected a common man (see
Sanhedrin, page 270), and similarly to this, we have seen last year when
the measure of the renowned Stoecker's deeds were full, his comrade,
Greenberg, who exchanged his needle for a scribe's pen, and when driven
out from the Socialists in Berlin, became a comrade of Stoecker, and
finally his secretary, and later sold him with all his writings for ten
German *thalers*, so that it became known who the Preacher of the Royal
Court was, and a case identical to that of Rohling-Bloch, that he
(Rohling) fell into the hands of a equally characterless man,
Bloch, <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) whom God had created for this
dark day, as said above that from all the great Jewish men of Vienna,
not one of them humiliated himself to enter into a fight with Rohling.
However, if there is need for a miracle to occur, it matters little from
whence it comes, and after all, we have to praise Bloch that he was the
cause for the appearance of such a book, just as the prophetess Deborah
praised the prostitute *Jael* \[judges, v. .24\]: "Blessed shall she be
of the women of the *tent*."

No. 20. The following is a translation of a few pages of the beginning
of our pamphlet, "Der Schulchan Aruch und seine Beziehungen zu den Juden
und Nichtjuden." "On the 10th of December, 1883, a trial came before the
'Landesgerichte,' at Münster, which created a great commotion in all
Germany" . . . viz., "one of the anti-Semites, named Dr. Justus,
published a pamphlet in Paderborn under the name 'Judenspiegel'
containing 100 law paragraphs of the 'Schulchan Aruch,' concerning the
treatment of 'Akum,' abbreviation of three words, 'Obde Kochabim
Umazoleth,' literally, 'worshipper of stars and planets.' However, the
author, Justus, put the word 'Christians' instead of 'Akum' in every

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

place in the text. The editor of 'The Merkin' in Münster quoted many
passages of this pamphlet with a glaring editorial, and the
district-attorney, who considered such as an incitation against a race,
made him responsible for this. The 'Landesgerichte' appointed two
experts, one a Jew, Dr. Treu, a Hebrew teacher in the 'royal gymnasium,'
and a Gentile, Dr. Ecker, an instructor in Semitic languages." <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md)

Dr. Ecker Privatdocent at the royal academy of this place declares, that
having devoted the last ten years exclusively to the study of Semitica,
he is in a position to express an opinion. He then goes on to say:

"In the first place, I feel it my duty to point out that I can in no way
agree with the conclusions arrived at by my esteemed colleague, Treu,
and that concerning the essential point I entertain a conviction the
very opposite of his. Three questions are here concerned which I am to
answer:

\(1\) Is the 'Schulchan Aruch' vested with legal sanction?

\(2\) Does the word 'Akum' mean also Christians?

\(3\) Are the quotations of Dr. Justus in agreement with the original
text."

As his answer to the first question treats about the "Schulchan Aruch"
only, and also whether the Jews at *that* time are to be named Schulchan
Aruch Jews or Talmud Jews, we omit it as it does not belong to the
purpose of our history. We begin therefore with the second point.

"As to the second point, whether the word Akum comprises also
Christians, I do not see how this can be denied. It is my firm
conviction that Akum is nothing less nor more than non-Jews. And I
believe that the Christians too belong to this class. Thus a law book
that has appeared in the middle of the sixteenth century in *Krakau*
should contain laws regulating the behavior of Jews (1) towards Jews,
(2) toward planet-worshippers who live hundreds of miles away? This is
indeed ridiculous. Gentlemen, allow me to draw a comparison. Suppose,
here in Munster, a Jew would conceive a notion to sit down and write a
new law book in which there are but two classes of laws, how the Jews
should behave toward Jews and toward--well, for my part let him call
them what be may, it means after all non-Jews; suppose further that the
prescribed behavior toward non-Jews is very rude and inhuman, and the
author is held responsible for so treating the Christians, the learned
Jew says: Ye Christians of Munster are not at all included in the class
of non-Jews, which class has reference to the--Hottentots!

"Now, gentlemen, it is just as ridiculous to assert that in the
sixteenth century there have appeared laws in Krakau regulating the
behavior of Jews toward planet

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

worshippers, and the Christians are nowhere mentioned. And, gentlemen,
since this point has received no emphasis on the part of my esteemed
colleague, it is important to call attention to it! If Akum does not
comprise Christians, then laws against Christians are wholly missing. In
the 'Shulchan Aruch' there are mentioned only Jews and Akum; we
Christians are surely not Jews, hence we are *beyond all doubt confused
in the term Akum*.

"I repeat once more, Akum is congruent with non-Jews. The Rabbis them.
selves prove this. I have in my possession a recent Wilna edition of the
'Shulchan Aruch,' in which not infrequently the word Akum of the older
editions is substituted by *Eno Ichudi*, *i.e.* non-Jew. The fear for
the censor prompted many to an alteration, but in this case it has
rather been an unhappy one, since the publishers themselves say that
Akum is synonymous with non-Jew."

We are in a position to meet also this issue of the Herr Expert. The
term non-Jews is by no means generic for the term Christian. In order to
fully perceive the truth of this statement, it remains for the learned
doctor to merely cross the channel over to England. This great world
dominating nation consists in its overwhelming majority of pious and
strict Christians. They sacrifice millions for the propagation of the
Christian creed, and the evangelic writings all over the world. However,
they call themselves with self-gratification, "The genuine Jews, sons of
*The New Union*." They pretend to be the descendants of the
enigmatically vanished ten tribes of Israel, and to still be Jews, body
and soul. Very often you find on their worship places and educational
institutions inscriptions in both English and Hebrew. Here you read in
strikingly large letters: "*Chapel of the Jews-Christians*,"
"*Jewish-Nazaric School*." In the cosmopolis London the most influential
princes and the highest state officers call themselves with
self-consciousness, "*Jew-Christians*." What then is the decisive trait
that makes the Christian a non-Jew? Furthermore, the theologically
educated Expert can hardly be believed to be ignorant of the fact that
the first adherents of Christianity in its *statu nascendi* had
preserved the name Jews for a long period, had remained piously obedient
to the customs, precepts and tenets of the Jews, and had in their
outward apparel distinguished themselves in nothing from their former
brethren in creed. Notwithstanding their sincere devotion to the new
movement, they still called themselves, "*devout sons of Israel*"; only
few were they who assumed an outspoken antagonistic position with regard
to the customary Rabbinic or Pharisaic ordinances, and were on this
account stigmatized by the Talmud as "Min," "Apikores." Now, has
non-Jews always been identical with Christian? Aside from this the first
edition of the "Schulchan Aruch" was printed in Adrianople (Turkey),
where the most inhabitants were Mussulmans.

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

Such falsifications of the text in more recent editions have perplexed
me to some extent, when I investigated the laws of Justus. The fourth
law reads: 'When a Jew is met by an Akum (Christian) with a cross in his
hand, the Jew is strictly prohibited from bowing his head.' However, in
my Wilna edition I find instead of Akum the word *adam*, *i.e.* man. I
then compared a new Stettin edition, and there I even find: 'When an
*obed kochabim* (star worshipper) with *abodath kochabim* (idol) in hand
meet,' whence nothing could, of course, be proved. Only in an older
edition I have found the original: 'When an Akum meets you with a *sheti
vaereb* (*i.e.* woof and warp = *cross*).' And, gentlemen, this proof is
incontrovertible. It is known to everybody that *no heathen reveres the
cross*. Akum here *must* mean a Christian."

One moment, profound Herr Dr. Ecker, the case appears after all to be
very far from being so manifest and ultimately settled. During their
existence, extending over thousands of years, the Jews had experienced
among the various nations many a thing of which many a sage can not even
dream and which seems unknown also to Dr. Ecker, the theologian, who
bears even the title Doctor. As there is in general *nothing new under
the sun*, the consecration of the cross in Christianity was not a wholly
new creation. In the Brahman religion the cross had enjoyed great esteem
some six centuries B.C. The Hindu symbolized therein the space relations
of the universe. According to accounts relating to those times, the
Fakirs would stand motionless, their hands stretched crosswise, for days
or, as some would have it, even for weeks until the nails on their
fingers would grow to be inches long. By thus blunting their bodily
sensibility they endeavored to give palpable expression to the negation
of man's earthly existence. The commentary to Eben Ezra, *mekor chaim*,
gives in the book *Margalioth* an account of this custom. Accordingly,
it is by no means so incredible nor could have been so infrequent that a
Jew should have met a heathen with a cross. The assumption is therefore
plausible that the Talmud had in view such heathens. However, we admit
that this is merely an hypothesis, and that Shulchan Aruch was no more
familiar with Indian mythology than Dr. Ecker appears to be. We aim
solely at showing that it is possible for one impelled by judophobic
purposes to carry on the study of Semitica for ten years, and yet
exhibit drastic ignorance here and there--all diluted eloquence and vain
presumptions notwithstanding--and that it is altogether ill-becoming to
venture upon expressing a competent opinion on Jewish laws that have
arisen in ancient times. It is of this that we wanted to remind Herr Dr.
Ecker and his anti-Semitic commilitants.

"In conclusion one more proof that will of necessity convince everybody.
We all know that the Jews do not eat meat unless it has been slaughtered
by a Jew. Meat slaughtered by Christians is not 'kosher,' and yet the
'Shulchan Aruch' says that meat slaughtered by an Akum is not kosher;
hence Akum means also the Christian."

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

Patience, Herr Dr. Ecker. Also this your far-fetched remark deserves an
answer, and such that will remove the scales off your eyes. How indeed
is it possible that a theologian who has been exploring Jewish
literature for ten years should exhibit such salient gaps? The most
ignorant Jew could beat you in this point. Who does not know that only a
trained slaughterer examined and supplied with a diploma is allowed to
slaughter? Any other Jew, and he that the most enlightened and
distinguished among the Rabbis themselves, is not entitled to slaughter,
and were he to do it the meat of this animal would be unallowable and
regarded as though the animal had been torn to pieces by a beast of
prey, and is therefore "*Terefa*," (torn.) And upon this case Dr. Ecker
bases his deduction that Akum is absolutely a Christian, for the cattle
slaughtered by an Akum is not kosher? How ridiculous! Is it kosher if
slaughtered by a Jew not in possession of the right to slaughter?

"Now comes the important third question: Are the laws of Dr. Justus
really contained in the 'Shulchan Aruch'? Herr Colleague Treu has made
the utterance that many a point of these laws is not contained in the
'Shulchan Aruch.' Particular stress was apparently laid on this remark.
The case is not set down with precision I compared all the laws with the
original text and reached the following result should simply sign my
name under all these 100 laws from A to Z, you require of me. In their
main substance they are correctly contained in the 'Shulchan Aruch,' but
the foundations of some single laws are borrowed by the author somewhere
else; on the whole, however, well grounded. I admit, and this is natural
enough, that the laws are *poignantly* formulated, and in some cases in
a manner which I should not approve of. We read, *e.g.*, in law 79: 'The
Jew is allowed to eat unclean in case of a dangerous sickness . . .
however, he is not allowed even in this case to use for his cure
something that belongs (in the opinion of the Jews) to the most-unclean,
viz., to a Christian Church.' As already observed, no mention is made of
Christians, and also here in the text it reads 'idol worship.' Of course
Christian Church too belongs here. Thus, the case is not untrue, yet in
its formulation the law sounds sharper and Dr. Justus should have left
the text also unaltered and added Christian Church' in parentheses."

Truly, we are at a loss to find the proper expression that might
appropriately characterize this expert deposition of a theologically
educated priest. Let us in the first place inquire somewhat more closely
into the law in question, which in its formulation is in neither the
Talmud nor the Shulchan Aruch. In the former we read: "If a man is
seized with bulimy he may be fed with unclean food, till his eyes become
clear" (Yoma, 125) . Here no mention is made of either Akum or idol
worship. In the Shulchan Aruch the same law is worded as follows: It is
allowed to give the dangerously sick *prohibited* food to eat (Orach
Chaim, 6 18, 9). Here again the word unclean has been eliminated. Still
another passage

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

treating of the same subject reads: "For curing purposes all is allowed
to be used but the wood of an Ashera, Astrate, that what was in
Phœnician an unchaste phallus-idol." We read further in the same place:
"With all things it is permitted to cure one's self except by means of
idolatry, adultery and shedding of blood." (Pesachim, 36.) The word
Tumah = unclean is not met here at all. In the Shulchan Aruch this law
is restated as follows: "It is not allowed to seek convalescence in the
name of idols" (Yoreh dea, 155.) Neither is here the word Tumah to be
found. It thus remains an enigma where Dr. Justus may have borrowed the
expression "*the most unclean*," which is to Dr. Ecker of course
synonymous with the *Christian Church*, since the word is not at all
used in the original text in connection with *this* law! But we must do
justice to Dr. Ecker; he possesses a highly cunning method of
polemizing; he displays admirable dexterity in securing for his comrade
Dr. Justus an open back-door. Yes, indeed, Dr. Ecker is master of his
art, he leaves far behind that so-called "Jewish method of polemizing,"
which has been according to the "Germania" revealed in this action. Herr
Dr. Ecker makes notably the statement that Dr. Justus has taken his law
from the Shulchan Aruch, their interpretations, however, he has borrowed
from *somewhere* else. This open admission manifests the intention of
false conception. Dr. Justus has namely borrowed that marked, or to use
the language of Dr. Ecker, "*poignant*" expression from a place that has
absolutely nothing in common with the law in question. Aboda Zara,
*i.e.* idol worship, is termed in the Talmud the father of uncleanness:
Abh hatumah, which defiles by touch (Sabbath, Aboda Zara.) Now Dr.
Justus resorts to the following stratagem; he renders Abh hathmah with
"the most unclean," substitutes Aboda Zara, idol worship, by "Christian
Church," then he fabricates a law under the label of the Shulchan Aruch
which has never had any thing of the kind, and in the name of this firm
sends it out into the wide world. Dr. Ecker, it is true, finds that such
method of procedure is "poignant," but on the whole correct and to the
point. What may criticism say on such an escapade? If a Jew had the
mishap of venturing upon such a shaky ground, the whole stock of
degrading names, such as rogue, rascal, impostor, misanthrope, etc.,
would not suffice to stigmatize so shameless a forger. Indeed it
requires very little originality and still less sagacity or witchcraft
to pick out phrases from places that stand in no relation to one
another, and compile them with a view of criminating whomever it may be.
Dr. Justus has done such a work, and a Catholic priest, a custodian of
the church

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

who should adhere to truth, right and peace, has the impudence to assert
that this work is in substance *correct*, though *poignant* because
"Christian Church" should have been enclosed in parentheses; as if then
the falsehood would turn to truth! Can a theologian bear such false
testimony, a priest who declares himself to be well versed in the Hebrew
and hence competent to pass judgment on Rabbinical literature?

Let us now examine somewhat more closely the Hebrew concept, "*Tumah*,"
In default of a corresponding similarly expressive German word, one is
of necessity prompted to render it with "unclean." In reality, however,
the Biblical and Rabbinical "Tumah," is *toto cælo* different from the
current notion unclean. The German "unclean" is synonymous with the dirt
and filth, which is in no way the case with Tumah. According to the
Mosaic law, a human corpse is the very origin, the progenitor of all
Tumah, "*Abhi aboth hatumah*." In Dr. Ecker's German this could be
styled "the most unclean." The tent, the room that shelters a corpse,
with all the utensils therein, is permeated with the fluid of *Tumah*,
uncleanness. Whoever lingers, sits or sleeps there, whoever touches the
corpse, is infected with the *Tumah* and becomes in turn "Abh hatumah,"
the father of uncleanness, and he who touches the Abh hatumah is called
"*Rishon lettimah*," the first of uncleanness; he is prohibited for
seven days from entering the sanctuary or from approaching the altar. He
imparts *Tumah* to him who may happen to touch him. It is here
absolutely immaterial whether the corpse was, when alive, sheltering the
divine spirit of Moses, of the crowned bard of the unparalleled psalm
songster David, or of one of the lowliest in the Jewish nation. The
assertion that the corpse of Moses, David, etc., is the most unclean
would be a sure symptom of insanity. Are the two words Tumah and unclean
congruent? The religious law of *Tumah* is laid down in the Torah
without foundation at all, and belongs to those laws concerning which we
venture to speculate, yet are unable to warrant their validity. Now, the
Rabbis, eager to keep the Jews from following idolatry of those times,
to prevent all contact therewith, were therefore teaching: "An idol
defiles by touch; it is not allowed even for curing purposes." However,
it was not the material part of the idol that was prohibited, such as
the wood, the stone, the dust (for the use of all this was allowed in
case of danger), but the prohibition is to be conceived of in the
following sense. If one were to whisper in the ear of a dangerously sick
person: "I will in your behalf invoke the help of this or that idol," as
such was really the case with Ben Dama, the nephew of

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

R. Ismael (Aboda Zara, 27), it is such a medicinal use of the idol that
one is energetically warned against. Supposing now that the emblems of
Christianity too are actually subsumed under the category of idols,
which is by no means the case, supposing further that it is prohibited
to seek recovery by their help, even then there would be no way of
justifying a rationally thinking person in his attempting to refer such
a prohibition to the Christian Church, or to go further yet, and assert
that the latter is in the mind of the Jews *unclean*, or, according to
Dr. Ecker, altogether *the most unclean*.

As an illustration of how the Rabbinical school used to term *Tumah*, we
quote an eloquent account of the Mishnah \[Iodaim, 4\]: "The Sadducees
were once deriding their antagonists, the Pharisees, as follows: 'How
amazingly absurd is your procedure in establishing laws! the writings of
Homer are not defiling while the sacred books of the Bible should be
subject of defiling; is it not the height of absurdity?' Hereupon
replied R. Johanan b. Zakai: You could adduce against us yet other
analogous but more drastic facts; the bones of an ass are not defiling
while those of the high-priest Johann Hyrcan do defile! How would you
solve this paradox?" Whereupon the Sadducees answered: "This is obvious.
The position one holds when alive is in direct ratio with the
uncleanness after death; the more revered and beloved one was when
alive, the more defiling is his corpse." Now you see, said R. Johanan b.
Zakai, this speaks as well as for us, I could turn the very same weapons
unto ye! the profane writings of Homer--that are not our favorite--are
indifferent to us, they do not defile; the sacred books which we revere
and love are subjects of defiling the hands that touch them!

Now, if according to Dr. Ecker's and Justus's literary artifice, the
Christian Church too belongs "*of course*," to the *most unclean*, is it
not possible in the rabbinical sense to construe on the contrary a
consecration, a proof of superior esteem for the church? Ye gentlemen
Doctors, where is your wisdom?

Artifices of this kind can be brought about only by a Dr. Justus, who,
impregnated with malice and Jew-hatred, misuses ink and paper to openly
and scornfully defy the truth. And a consecrated priest, an academic
teacher, stamps his approval upon his tricky work and in a sacred place
where justice is being administered, whither he, credited agreeably to
his sect and position, was summoned to conscientiously elucidate the
truth, where he might have been made to confirm under oath the veracity
of his conviction! Verily, Dr. Ecker has badly sinned, not only against
the Jewish people, but also against Christian Germany! Is then in our
age the Hebrew literature a book sealed with seven seals? Are not there
in Germany

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

also Christian savants who could detect this arbitrary procedure, who
could trace to its source such a groundless absurdity? Would that he may
perceive the opinion of the Christian professors, Delitzsch, Cassel,
etc., expressed with reference to his expert opinion, he would see then
whether they regard his depositions as actually impartial, or as of a
wholly different nature, he would learn whether they agree with him in
that the Christian Church too belongs *of course* to the most unclean!
This is, honorable priest of the church, your impartiality, such is it
prima facie!

"I should like yet to touch here upon the point which was thought to be
important when Herr Colleague Treu has pointed out that he has nowhere
read in the 'Shulchan Aruch' that Christians are worse than dogs. To be
sure, it is manifest that a law book is not the place to state that the
Christians are worse than dogs; but it is perverse to infer from here
that Dr. Justus has falsified the text. This sentence was namely brought
forth as a foundation of law 31, where note 3 remarks, however, that it
is borrowed from the renowned exegete Rashi."

We do not know the passage attributed to Rashi. However, places of this
nature are not rare in the Talmud. Let us quote such a passage. The
question was discussed, for whom it is allowed to prepare food on a
holiday; in this connection it reads: "What causes you to exclude the
Akum. from, and to introduce the dogs into, the law? The dogs depend on
you in their food and rearing, therefore I treat of them in the law, but
the Akum. I exclude, for no one is obliged to take care of him," (Betza,
21b). Rashi has surely commented on such a place in the Talmud, and Dr.
Justus was dexterous enough to forge thereof a poisoned arrow and to
direct it as best it suits his instincts. But is here even a particle of
insinuating contempt and depreciation of *an Akum* or a Christian? In
the foregoing quotation the question is discussed as to the preparing of
food on such holidays that do not coincide with the Sabbath, which
preparing is allowed only for such persons and animals that depend on
others in their food. We refer yet the reader to our next observation.

"Another point was contended against by Herr Treu, in law 17, which
treats of the case that the Jews pray when the plague rages in their
midst, but not when the plague is among animals. Here it reads further:
'But they do (pray) when the plague is among *swine*, as their
intestines resembles those of man, *likewise* when the plague is among
Akum (Christians).' I agree with Herr Treu that in lieu of 'likewise'
should be 'the more so,' and therewith the law loses its poignancy, but
it looks suspicious all the same that in one and the same line the *Akum
are coupled together with swine*."

The Herr Privatdocent of the royal academy displayed masterly skill to
excite his audience, and to unbridle the passions of hatred. Verily,
also we must make an extraordinary effort to control our

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

agitated mind. The reasons, however, lie by no means in the affected
depreciation of the human dignity in general, or of that of the Akum in
particular, no matter who is meant thereby as ascertained by the Expert,
but in the boundless ignorance of this theological doctor, which is
truly astonishing, nay startling. And yet he asserts to have been
studying Semitica for ten years! David, the King of Israel, was
considered by the older Rabbis, the highest unattainable authority, the
ideal of the Jewish people. As far as rank and merits are concerned,
they put him above the Patriarchs Moses and Joshua, each of whom, they
tell us, had his hands stained in one way or other, wherefore none of
them was honored with saying the benediction over the goblet. David,
however, was found wholly stainless, the goblet was predestined for him,
and only he was allowed to grasp it and praise therewith the Omnipotent!
This legend is to be found in Talmud (Pesachim, 119). But the very same
so highly revered David is somewhere else coupled together with dogs,
and, in defiance of all shame and discretion, treated even worse than a
dog--in the sense of Justus and Ecker. It is namely recorded: David
died, and his son and successor to the throne, Solomon, had his
messenger ask in the college as follows: "The remains of my royal father
are exposed to the scorching sun rays, the dogs of my father's household
are hungry and menace them, may I in view of all this touch on the day
of Sabbath the remains, and have them sheltered?" Hereupon came the
answer: "First of all satisfy the hunger of the dogs by having a carcass
cut to them; thereafter put upon your father's corpse a loaf of bread or
a child, then you may have it removed into the shade." Contemplating
this, Solomon made in his later years the utterance: "Truly the living
dog is better than the dead lion." Thus reads the legend in the Talmud
(Sabbath, 32). And more yet; of their own people the sages say: "Three
are insolent, Israel among the nations, the dog among the animals, the
cock among the birds" (Betza, 25). Who would assert that in these
passages David and [Israel](errata.htm#35.md) are depreciated? This
elementary point should not have escaped the consciousness of a
theologian trained in the Hebrew and Rabbinical literature, viz., that
expressions of this kind were current among the law teachers of those
days, without, however, any intention on their part to either elevate or
degrade any one! Again, we read in the Talmud (Pesach, 112): "The rabbis
taught, there are three who hate one another: the dogs, the cocks, and
the sages." Others add yet the rival women, still others also the
teachers at the Babylonian academies. Well, Dr. Ecker, what would you
say to this point? Could the sages find no better company than the dogs,
cocks and rivals? And

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

again, are the Evangelists more moderate in their language? Does not
Matthew also call the nations *dogs and swine*? (Mat., 6, 7). Where then
is here room for indignation? The patriarch Jacob on his death-bed
blesses his sons who surround him. Their characteristic merits and
defects he designates by animal forms which they resemble. Jehudah he
calls a young lion, Naftali a bitch, Issachar an ass, Dan a serpent,
Benjamin, his youngest favorite, a rending wolf. Moses, too, calls in
his farewell blessing the tribe of Joseph, "a first-born ox." Should
these two reverend old men have had the malicious intention, at the most
serious moment when they were preparing to part with life, to revile and
insult? Here is a point for Herr Dr. Ecker to meditate on! <span

No. 21. As we are lacking in time we requested the dean of this faculty
to send us a copy of the curriculum with an admission card, so that we
might arrive at the exact hour appointed for some lectures on the Talmud
and on theology which we saw announced in the programme; to which we
received the following letter:

THE JEWISH THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY OF AMERICA.

NEW YORK, *January* 5, 1903.

Dear Sir.--Your letter of the 21st ult. is just before me. I have not
yet been able to send you a copy of the curriculum, which I shall be
very glad to do when it is printed. Whilst a weekly curriculum

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

has been adopted for the year, some of its provisions are still under
advisement, and I have not deemed it wise to put it in print.

I have not at the moment any copy of the hours of the lectures either,
nor do I really think it would be profitable for you to attend an
occasional lecture, as you suggest. You realize, too, that the classes
must necessarily consist of young men, that practically every hour
involves a certain amount of recitation, and that the students will feel
awkward, or necessarily ill at ease, in the presence of some one older
than themselves.

Yours very truly,                      

S. SCHECHTER,            

President of the Faculty.

No. 22. The Jewish Encyclopædia is undoubtedly a monumental work and
most eminent scholars in both continents are taking part in it, and
there a great many scientific articles which are instructive to the
students and also many laymen are pleased by reading a great deal of
articles in every branch. (True, that some articles though scientific
would be better if omitted in the encyclopædia. We refer to Dr. P.
Mendus' message to the Union Orthodox congregations which took place
recently.) However, because it is a monumental work, we cannot restrain
ourselves from remarking that the editors should be more careful in
their revision of the articles. In Appendix No. 8, we show that the
bibliographies are not complete and now we will remark that the editors
are not careful in their biographies.

There is a short biographical sketch in Vol. I., p. 16, of Aaron Ha-Levi
Ben Moses of Staroselye, who was our mother's father. In the *American
Hebrew*, June 28, 1901, we have already remarked that his family name
was Hurwitz, which he received from his ancestor, the famous Ishiah
Halevi Hurivitz, known by the name Shelaw, the author of "Snee Luchoth
Habrith," and this was omitted.

We have then overlooked that his main and wonderful work, "Sharee
Haychud ve Haemuna" (Gates of the Unity (of God) and its Creed) is not
mentioned. This great work has surprised not only the Cabbalists and
Chasidim, but also the Maskilim like Sneier Zachs and Lazar Zwefel. The
former mentioned it in his well-known "Hathchia" thus: "and the
wonderful work by Aaron Hurivitz" and so also the latter in his "Solom
Al Israel," who speaks of it enthusiastically and at length. Remarkable
it is that in the bibliography of the sketch is mentioned Rodkinson's
"Toldath

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Amude Hachabad"
and in this book his family name as well as the above-mentioned work
with more particulars are to be found. By this we see that the editor of
this subject did not care to look up the bibliography at least to make
it correct. He should at least have seen Fünns' "Kneset Israel," in
which the name and the books are mentioned.

All this concerns the incorrect biography. Should we count the omissions
of the names of very great men, even only of Aaron and Abraham of all
classes, who ought to be mentioned in the encyclopædia, who played a
great rôle in Israel, it would take too much space and time. A glance
into our *Biographie sämmtlicher Rabbiner der Gouvernments Vollhynien,
Podolien, Ukraine, Gross- Klein-Polen und Galizien von Jahre* 1695 *bis*
1876 (Konigsberg 1876), pp. 30-34, will convince the reader of this.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_11"></span>[122:1](ht123.htm#fr_11.md) What concerns Ben
Zakkai, according to Heilprin, in his "Seder Hadoroth," and other
authorities, Johanan b. Zakkai died 72 years A. C., that is, about forty
years after the death of Jesus, at which time the followers of the
latter had already begun to dispute with their Jewish colleagues. We
also find a disciple of Johanan b. Zakkai whom he very much respected,
very friendly to, and pleased with, Jacob of the village Sachnon, who
was one of the first disciples of Jesus. Hence our conjecture.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[122:2](ht123.htm#fr_12.md) Speaking of the
encyclopædias, we are sorry to say that in spite of the advertising of
their completeness, with all additional information in every branch up
to the time of publication, one can not rely upon them. It seems to us
that they omit the mention of books of great interest. According to our
knowledge, books the subject of which is interesting to most students,
not to speak of whether they are well done or not, ought to be mentioned
and, if necessary, with a remark about the quality of the books. Now
take the "Century Encyclopedia-Dictionary and Atlas," which is
advertised as the best of its kind and which is published in New York
City, and if we look under the subject "Talmud," the fourteen or fifteen
volumes of the *first* English translation of the "Talmud" by Michael L.
Rodkinson, published in the, same city, are not to be found, although
about 175 daily papers and periodicals, here and abroad, noticed and
reviewed the publication. The same is the case with Appleton's new
encyclopædia under the same title "Talmud." Here also Rodkinson's
translation is not mentioned, though some small tracts which were
translated into German are mentioned. Still more remarkable is it, that
the reviser of this article <span id="page_123">p. 123</span> on the
"Talmud" was Dr. Richard Gottheil, who is one of the editors of the
Jewish Encyclopædia, and who himself wrote a criticism in "The Bookman"
in 1897 upon this translation. What concerns the Jewish Encyclopædia,
which is devoted only to matters relating to the Jews, one is still more
astonished on examining its bibliographies. On pages 390 and 394 of vol.
ii., etc., etc., the contents of Tracts Baba Batra Metzia and Kama are
explained. In the bibliography of this article are neither mentioned the
excellent translation into French by 1. M. Rabbinowicz nor the
translation into English by Michael L. Rodkinson. The same is the case
with vol. iv., Page 526, etc., concerning the tracts "Derekh-Erez Rabba"
and "Zuta," for in the bibliography there is not mentioned its
translation in vol. i. (ix.) into English by the same M. L. Rodkinson,
together with Abot de Rabbi Nathan, which is mentioned in the first
volume, page 82. Here the bibliography reads: "An English version is
given by M. L. Rodkinson in his translation of the Babylonian Talmud, I.
(IX.), New York, 1900." We cannot find any excuse for such a sin of the
bibliographer unless we ascribe it to the carelessness of the editors,
for even if the authors of the articles were ignorant of it, in spite of
the fact that this translation is to be found in almost all the
libraries of the cities and countries, still the editors ought not to
have been so.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[123:1](ht123.htm#fr_13.md) To the critics who will
try to find fault with us because of the article by Prof. Schechter in
the *Westminster Review* of January and April, we will say that in spite
of the respect which we feel for the article and the author, we do not
agree with it on many points. Therefore, without any controversies, we
state here what seems reasonable to us, leaving it to the reader to
judge.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[124:1](ht123.htm#fr_14.md) He quotes namely, the
places of the Talmud which were translated by him.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[126:1](ht123.htm#fr_15.md) In our pamphlet
"Barquai," Vienna, 1886, all Bloch's proceedings as well as his
character are related.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[121:1](ht123.htm#fr_16.md) The testimonies of Dr.
Treu, who was a Jew, we do not deem necessary to translate, especially
as they may be understood from the answers of Dr. Ecker. However, the
latter's testimony and our replies we translate literally for the
purpose of enlightening such passages which are to be found in the
Talmud.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[136:1](ht123.htm#fr_17.md) We are convinced that
many, yes, *very* many, offensive passages in the Talmud are traceable
to the Jews-Christians among the Rabbis. For a long time theme
Jews-Christians remained in close relations with their Jewish brethren,
refrained from ostentatiously manifesting their belief in the messianism
of Jesus; however, in their innermost selves they entertained and
nourished a more and more unfolding rancor against the teachings as well
as against the authority of the law teachers, who would by means of all
imaginable contrivances interfere with their clandestine plans to carry
on propaganda for their idea. Jacob from Kefar Sekania and Jacob Minaah
(Megila, 23) are mentioned as such, and there must have been many of
this class. It is to these Jews-Christians that we attribute the
authorship of some of the above-cited sentences that sound in a measure
defamatory to the Rabbis. In like manner the foregoing David legend may
have originated in these circles. Indeed, David was far from being
stainless; he himself was conscious of it and expressed it in a
penitential psalm to which we refer (Psalm 51). But as the pretended
ancestor of Jesus the adherents of the latter surrounded him with
dazzling though undeserved glory. (We, in our new edition of the Talmud
have omitted both legends concerning David, as we are certain they are
not to be ascribed to the Rabbis of the Talmud; see also our edition
\[Betza, 491 footnotes. We have omitted the whole saying but Maelits,
for the same reason.) In this, our pamphlet, from page 35 on, we explain
all the passages where *Akum* is mentioned and what it signifies, not by
suppositions but by facts, and as it is written in the German language,
we may refer the reader, who would like to know this, to them.
