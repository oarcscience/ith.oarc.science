| XXXIX\. 15<sup>c</sup> | \[With songs of the harp and of stringed instruments,           |     | and thus with a shout shalt thou say;               |
| 16                     | All \[the works of\] God are good,                              |     | and he supplieth every need in its season.          |
| 17<sup>c</sup>         | . . . . appraise . . . .                                        |     | and the utterance of his mouth is his treasure.     |
| 18                     | In \[his\] place he maketh his pleasure to prosper,             |     | and there is no restraint to his salvation.         |
| 19                     | The works of all flesh are before him,                          |     | and there is nothing hid from before his eyes.      |
| 20                     | He beholdeth from everlasting to everlasting:                   |     | \[is there\] limit to his salvation?                |
| 20<sup>c</sup>         | There is nothing small or light with him,                       |     | and there is nothing too wonderful or hard for him. |
| 21                     | None may say, Wherefore is this?                                |     | or all things are chosen for their uses.            |
| 21<sup>c</sup>         | None may \[say\], This is worse than that,                      |     | for all things prevail in their season.             |
| 22                     | He maketh his blessings to overflow as the Nile,                |     | and it saturateth the land like a river.            |
| 23                     | For his wrath dispossesseth nations,                            |     | and he turneth a watered land into salt.            |
| 24                     | \[The path\]s of the perfect man are plain,                     |     | so to strangers do they oppose themselves.          |
| 25                     | \[Good things\] he allotted to the \[g\]ood from the beginning, |     | so to the evil good and evil;                       |
| 26                     | \[The chief things\] for the life of man are water,             |     | and fire, and iron, and salt,                       |
| 26<sup>c</sup>         | \[Flour of wheat\], milk, and honey,                            |     | the blood of the grape, fresh oil, and clothing.    |
| 27                     | All th\[ese\] bring good to the \[g\]ood,                       |     | so for the evil they are turned to evil;            |
| 28                     | There be w\[inds which are formed \[for vengeance\],            |     | . . . \[they\] remove mountains.                    |
| 28<sup>c</sup>         | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                 |     | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                     |

| 29             | Fire and hail, evil and pestilence,                                                         |     | these also are \[formed\] for judgement.                                     |
| 30             | Beast of tooth, scorpion and cobra,                                                         |     | and a sword of vengeance to ban \[the wicked\].                              |
| 30<sup>c</sup> | All these are created for their uses,                                                       |     | and they are in his treasure-house, against the time when they are required. |
| 31             | When he commandeth them they rejoice,                                                       |     | and in their prescribed tasks they rebel not against his word.               |
| 32             | Therefore from the beginning I took my stand, and I considered, and set it down in writing; |     |                                                                              |
| 33             | All the works of God are good;                                                              |     | he sufficeth for every need in its season.                                   |
| 34             | None may say, This is evil, What is this?                                                   |     | for he maketh all things to prevail in their season.                         |
| 35             | Now with all (your) heart sing aloud,                                                       |     | and bless the name of the H\[oly One\].                                      |
| XL\. 1         | Great occupation hath God allotted,                                                         |     | and a heavy yoke is upon the sons of men;                                    |
| 1<sup>c</sup>  | From the day of his coming forth from his mother's womb,                                    |     | until the day of his returning to the mother of all living;                  |
| 3              | From him that sitteth loftily on a throne,                                                  |     | even unto him that is clothed in dust and ashes.                             |
| 4              | From him that weareth a diadem and (priestly) plate,                                        |     | even unto him that weareth a mantle \[of poverty\]:                          |
| 5              | Anger, jealousy, anxiety, and fear,                                                         |     | the terror of death, strife, and contention:                                 |
| 5<sup>c</sup>  | And in the time when he resteth upon his bed,                                               |     | the sleep of night changeth \[his thoughts\];                                |
| 6              | A little . . . . for a moment he is quiet,                                                  |     | and from the midst of terror\[s he is perturbed?\];                          |
| 6<sup>c</sup>  | . . . . . from the vision of his soul,                                                      |     | (he is) as a fugitive \[hurrying on before\] the pursuer.                    |

| 9              | \[Pestile\]nce and bloodshed, fever and drought,            |     | devastation and destruction, evil and death.                       |
| 10             | Against the wicked, evil is created,                        |     | and because of him ruin departeth \[not?\].                        |
| 11             | All things that are from the earth return to the earth,     |     | and that which is from the height (returneth) to the height.       |
| 13             | Riches born of (?) riches are like an ever-flowing stream,  |     | and as a mighty water-course in the flashing of thunder:           |
| 14             | With his lifting up of (his) hands men rejoice,             |     | for suddenly he perisheth for ever.                                |
| 15             | The branch of violence shall not be unpunished,             |     | for the root of the godless is on the point of a crag.             |
| 16             | Like axes (?) upon the bank of a stream,                    |     |  before all rain they are extinguished.                            |
| 17             | But kindness shall never be moved,                          |     | and righteousness (*or* almsgiving) shall be established for ever. |
| 18             | A life of wine and strong drink is sweet,                   |     | but he that findeth a treasure is above them both.                 |
| 19             | A child and a city establish a name,                        |     | but he that findeth wisdom is above them both.                     |
| 19<sup>c</sup> | Offspring (of cattle) and planting make a name flourish,    |     | but a woman beloved is above them both.                            |
| 20             | Wine and strong drink cause the heart to exult,             |     | but the love of lovers is above them both.                         |
| 21             | Pipe and harp make sweet the song,                          |     | but a sincere tongue is above them both.                           |
| 22             | \[Grace and beauty\] delight the eye,                       |     | but the growing things of the field are above them both.           |
| 23             | \[A friend and a partner\] behave \[as occasion requires\], |     | but a prudent wife is above them both.                             |
| 24             | A brother \[and a helper are for a ti\]me of adversity,     |     | but righteousness (or almsgiving) delivereth above them both.      |
| 25             | Gold and silver \[make the foot stand sure\]:               |     | but \[good counsels\] is above them both.                          |

| 26<sup>c</sup> | In the fear of the Lord there is no want,                        |     | and it needeth not to seek for \[treasure\] with it.                                |
| 27             | The fear of God is as an Eden of blessing,                       |     | and so all glory is its canopy.                                                     |
| 28             | My son, live not a life that subsists on giving:                 |     | better is he that is taken away (in death) than he that is importunate.             |
| 29             | A man that looketh at the table of a stranger,                   |     | his life is not to be numbered as a life;                                           |
| 29<sup>c</sup> | His dainties are a loathing of the soul;                         |     | to a man that hath understanding (they are as) pains of the bowels.                 |
| 30             | Begging is sweet to the greedy man,                              |     | but in his inward parts it burneth as fire.                                         |
| XLI\. 1        | Ah Death! how \[bit\]ter is the remembrance of thee              |     | to a man that liveth qui\[etly\] in his place;                                      |
| 1<sup>c</sup>  | To a man that is at ease and prospereth in all things,           |     | and that hath yet strength to receive pleasure.                                     |
| 2              | Aha Death! for acceptable (*lit*. good) is thy sentence          |     | unto him that hath no might, and lacketh strength;                                  |
| 2c             | (To) the man that stumbleth and striketh against all things,     |     | who loveth contradiction and hath lost hope.                                        |
| 3              | Be not afraid of death (which is) thy sentence,                  |     | remember that they which went before and they which come after (will be) with thee. |
| 4              | This is the portion of all flesh from God,                       |     | and why dost thou refuse the law of the Most High?                                  |

| 5              | A reprobate progeny is a byword of the evil,                     |     | and the offspring of the foolish is \[. . . of the wic\]ked.                        |
| 6              | From an unrighteous son cometh a rule of evil,                   |     | \[and with his\] seed \[abideth want\]                                              |
| 7              | An ungodly father a \[chi\]l\[d\] doth curse,                    |     | because \[on his\] acc\[ount he suffereth reproach\].                               |

| 11             | The vanity of man is in his body,                    |                | but a godly name shall not be cut off.                       |

| 20             | The cold of the north wind he causeth to blow,                                           |                | and congealeth his spring like rottenness (?).                                                  |
| 20<sup>c</sup> | Over every standing water he spreadeth a crust,                                          |                | and a pond putteth on as it were a breastplate.                                                 |
| 21             | It burneth up the produce like drought,                                                  |                | and the stateliness of growing things as a flame.                                               |
| 22             | The dropping of a cloud healeth all things,                                              |                | (even) dew releasing (?) the parched young grass.                                               |
| 23             | His counsel burneth up (?) the great (deep),                                             |                | and he planteth islands in the ocean.                                                           |

| 25             | Therein are wonders, the marvels of his work,                                            |                | variety of all things living, and the mighty things of the great (deep).                        |

PRAISE OF THE PATRIARCHS.

| XLIV\. 1      | Let me now praise godly men,                                          |     | our fathers in their generations.                               |
| 2             | Great glory the Most High allotted (to them),                         |     | and they were great from days of old;                           |
| 3             | Rulers of the earth in their royalty,                                 |     | and men of renown in their might;                               |
| 3<sup>c</sup> | Who gave counsel by their understanding,                              |     | and saw all things in their prophecy;                           |
| 4             | Princes of nations in their prudence,                                 |     | and potentates in their care;                                   |
| 4<sup>c</sup> | Wise of meditation in their writing,                                  |     | and governing in their watchfulness;                            |
| 5             | Who sought out music according to rule,                               |     | and took up the proverb in writing;                             |
| 6             | Men of worth, and supported with strength,                            |     | and that lived quietly upon their places.                       |
| 9             | All these in their generation (were honoured),                        |     | and from their birth was their glory.                           |
| 8             | There be of them that have left a name,                               |     | that men might tell of it in their inheritance;                 |
| 9             | And there be of them which have no memorial,                          |     | and have ceased as they have ceased;                            |
| 9<sup>c</sup> | They were as though they had not been,                                |     | and their children after them.                                  |
| 10            | Nevertheless these were godly men,                                    |     | and their hope \[shall not perish;                              |
| 11            | With their seed their goodness remaineth sure,                        |     | and their inheritance unto chil\[dren's children\];             |
| 13            | Their memory standeth fast for ever,                                  |     | and their righteousness \[shall not be forgotten\];             |
| 14            | \[Their bodies were buried in p\]eac\[e,                              |     | but their name liveth\] unto all generations a.                 |
| 16            | Enoch \[was f\]ound perfect, and walked with the Lord, and was taken, |     | being an example (*lit*. sign) of knowledge to all generations. |

| 17             | Noah the righteous was found perfect,             |     | in a season of destruction he became the successor;  |
| 17<sup>c</sup> | For his sake was there a remnant,                 |     | and through the covenant with him, the flood ceased; |
| 18             | By an everlasting sign was it made with him,      |     | that he would not destroy all flesh.                 |
| 19             | Abraham was the father of a multitude of nations, |     | he put no blemish upon his glory;                    |
| 20             | Who kept the commandment of the Most High,        |     | and entered into a covenant with him;                |
| 20<sup>c</sup> | In his flesh he made him an ordinance,            |     | and when he was proved he was found faithful.        |
| 21             | Therefore he promised him with an oath,           |     | that he would bless the nations in his seed,         |
| 21<sup>e</sup> | To cause them to inherit \[from se\]a to sea,     |     | and from the River unto the ends of the earth.       |
| 22             | To Isaac also did he raise up a son,              |     | for the sake of Abraham his father;                  |
| 22<sup>c</sup> | He gave him (?)the covenant of every ancestor,    | 23  | and the blessing rested on the head of Israel;       |
| 23<sup>b</sup> | And he confirmed him in the blessing,             |     | and gave him his inheritance;                        |
| 23<sup>d</sup> | And he set him in tribes,                         |     | in twelve parts.                                     |

| 2              | \[And G\]od 9 glorified him                       |     | and strengthened him in the heights (of heaven).     |
| 3              | By \[his words\] . . . . . . . . . . .,           |     | and gave him boldness before the king;               |
| 3<sup>c</sup>  | And gave him a charge unto \[his people\],        |     | and sh\[ewed him of his glory\].                     |
| 4              | For his faithfulness and meekness,                |     | he chose him out of all \[flesh\];                   |

| 7<sup>b</sup>  | And put majesty upon him,                                          |     | and he ministered unto him in his glory.                            |

| 8<sup>c</sup>  | The breeches, the coats, and the robe,                             | 9   | and \[compassed him\] with bells,                                   |
| 9<sup>b</sup>  | And pomegranates, a multitude round about,                         |     | to make music with his steps;                                       |

| 17             | Thou wast called by the glorious name,                         |     | which is called over Israel,                                 |

| 25             | For ever he declared things that should be,                      |     | and hidden things before they came.                           |
| XLIX\. 1       | The name of Josiah is like incense of sweet spices,              |     | salted, the work of the perfumer;                             |
| 1<sup>c</sup>  | His memory is sweet as honey on the palate,                      |     | and as music at the banquet of wine.                          |
| 2              | For he was grieved for our backslidings,                         |     | and he made the abominations of vanity to cease;              |
| 3              | And he made his heart perfect toward God,                        |     | and in days of violence he wrought godliness.                 |
| 4              | Except David, Hezekiah, and Josiah,                              |     | they all did corruptly;                                       |
| 4e             | And forsook the law of the Most High,                            |     | the kings of Judah, till they were ended.                     |
| 5              | So he turned their horn backward,                                |     | and (gave) their glory to a foolish, foreign nation;          |
| 6              | And they set on fire the holy city,                              |     | and made her ways desolate.                                   |
| 6<sup>e</sup>  | By the hand of Jeremiah, for they afflicted him,                 |     | yet from the womb he was formed (to be) a prophet,            |
| 7<sup>c</sup>  | To pluck up and to break down and to destroy (and) to overthrow, |     | and in like manner to build up, to plant, and to make strong. |
| 8              | Ezekiel saw the vision,                                          |     | and declared divers kinds of chariot.                         |
| 9              | Also he made mention of Job,                                     |     | who maintained all the w\[ays of righ\]teousness.             |
| 10             | Moreover the twelve prophets,                                    |     | may their strength flou\[rish out of their pla\]ces.          |
| 10<sup>c</sup> | Who recovered Jacob to health,                                   |     | and restored him by . . . . . . . .                           |
