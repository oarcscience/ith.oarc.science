# The Slave's Fortune

Ahmed was the only child of the wealthiest merchant in Damascus. His
father devoted his days to doing everything possible to anticipate his
wishes. The boy returned his father's love with interest, and the two
lived together in the utmost happiness. They were seldom apart, the
father curtailing his business journeys so that he could hastily return
to Damascus, and finally restricting his affairs to those which he could
perform in his own home.

For safety's sake, Ahmed, whenever he was out of his father's sight, was
attended by a big negro slave, Pedro, an imposing looking person, richly
attired as befitted his station and duties. Pedro was a faithful
servant, and he and Ahmed were the firmest friends.

When Ahmed grew up to be a youth, his father decided to send him to
Jerusalem to be educated. He did so reluctantly, knowing, however, that
it was the wisest course to adopt,

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gently he broke
the news to Ahmed, for he knew the latter would dislike to leave home.
Ahmed was truly sorry to have to be parted from his father, but he kept
back his tears and said bravely:

"It is thy wish, father, therefore I question it not. I know that thou
desirest only my welfare."

"Well spoken, my son," said his father.

"May I take Pedro with me?" asked Ahmed.

"Nay, that would not be seemly," answered his father, gently. "It would
make thee appear anxious to display thy wealth. Such ostentation will
induce people to regard thee and thy father as foolish persons,
possessed of more wealth than is good for the exercise of wisdom. Also,
my son, thy future teaching must be not confined to the learning that
wise men can impart unto thee. Thou art going to the great city to learn
the ways of the world, to train thyself in self-reliance, and to prepare
thyself for all the duties of manhood."

The youth was somewhat disappointed to hear this. It was the first
occasion, as far as his memory served him, that his father had failed to
grant his wish; but he was nevertheless flattered by the prospect of
quickly becoming

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

a man, and he answered, "I bow to thy wisdom, my father."

He left for Jerusalem, after bidding the merchant an affectionate
farewell, and in the Holy City he applied himself diligently to his
studies. He delighted his teachers with his cheerful attention to his
lessons, and discovered a new source of happiness in learning things for
himself from observation. Also, it was a pleasant sensation to conduct
his own affairs, and in the great city, with its busy narrow
thoroughfares and its wonderful buildings, he daily grew less homesick.
Regularly he received letters by messengers from his father, and
dutifully he returned, by the same means, long epistles, setting out all
the big and little things that made up his life.

A year passed, and one day the usual message that Ahmed expected came to
him in a strange hand-writing.

He opened it hastily, with a foreboding of evil and alarm. The writer of
the letter was one of the merchant's closest friends. He said:

"O worthy son of a most worthy father, greeting to thee, and may God
give thee strength to hear the terrible and sad tidings which it is my
sorrowful duty to convey unto thee. Know

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

then that it hath pleased God in his wisdom to call from this earth thy
saintly father, to sit with the righteous ones in Heaven. Here in the
city of Damascus there is great weeping, for thy honored father was the
most upright of men, a friend to all in distress, a man whose bounteous
charity to the poor and unfortunate was unsurpassed. But our grief, deep
and heartfelt as it is, cannot be compared to thine. We have all lost a
wise counselor, a trusty friend, a guide in all things. But thou hast
lost more. Thou hast lost a father. Thou art his only son, and on thee
his duties will now devolve. Know then thy profound grief we share with
thee. We tender to thee our sincere sympathy, and eagerly do we await
thy coming. Thou hast a noble position to occupy and a tradition to
continue. We, thy father's friends and thine, O Ahmed, will assist
thee."

The young man was dumbfounded when he gathered the purport of the
letter. For some moments he spoke not, but sat on the ground, weeping
silently. Then, remembering his father's admonitions, he promptly took
up the task of settling his affairs in Jerusalem prior to his departure
for Damascus.

"I will take with me," he said, "the good

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

rabbi who has been my religious instructor, for I am not fully prepared
to undertake all the duties that will fall to my lot and need some
strengthening counsel."

On arrival at Damascus he was greeted by a large concourse of people who
expressed their sympathy with him and spoke in terms of highest praise
of his father's benevolence.

After the funeral, Ahmed called the leading townspeople together to hear
his father's will read, for he was certain that many gifts to charities
would be announced. Such was the case, and there were subdued murmurs of
applause when the amounts were read forth.

Then suddenly the friend who had written to the young man and was
reading the will, paused.

"I fear there must be a mistake," he said, in a whisper to Ahmed.

"Go on," urged the assembled people, and the man read in a strange
voice:

"And now, having as I hope, faithfully performed my duty to the poor, I
bequeath the rest of my possessions unto my devoted negro slave, Pedro."

"Pedro!" cried the astonished crowd.

They looked at the massive figure of the black attendant, but he stood
motionless and impassive,

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

betraying no sign whatsoever of joy or surprise.

Ahmed could not conceal his bewilderment. "Is naught left unto me?" he
managed to ask.

"Yes," returned his friend, and amid a sudden silence, he continued to
read: "This bequest is subject to the following proviso: that one thing
be given to my son before the division of my property, the same to be
selected by him within twenty-four hours of the reading of this will
unto him."

The crowd melted away with mutterings of sympathy mingled with
astonishment, but out of earshot of Ahmed, all said the merchant must
have been mad to draw up so absurd a testament. Ahmed himself could
hardly realize the great blow that had befallen him. He consulted with
his father's friend and the rabbi, but, although they re-read the
document many times, they could find no fault or flaw in it.

"Legally, this is correct and in perfect order and cannot be altered,"
said the friend.

"My father must have made a foolish mistake and must have misplaced the
two words 'son' and 'slave,' " said Ahmed, bitterly.

"That does not so appear," said the rabbi;

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "thy father was a
scholar and wise man. Speak not hastily, and above all act not rashly
without thought. I would counsel thee to sleep over this matter, and in
the morning we shall solve this puzzle."

Ahmed, who was exhausted with grief and rage and surprise, soon fell
into a deep sleep, and when he awoke the rabbi was reciting his morning
prayers.

"It is a beautiful day," he said, when he had finished. "The sun shines
on thy happiness, Ahmed."

Ahmed was too depressed to make any comment, nor was he completely
satisfied when the rabbi assured him all would be well.

"I have pondered deeply and long over thy father's words," he said. "I
sat up through the night until the dawn, and I have been impelled to the
conclusion that thy father was truly a wise man."

Ahmed interrupted with a gesture of disapproval. The rabbi took no
notice but proceeded quietly: "Thy father must have feared that in thy
absence after his death and pending thy possible delay in returning
hither, slaves and others might rob thee of thy inheritance. Pedro, I
have discovered, knew of the terms of the will.

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> By informing him
and making his strange will, thy father, O fortunate Ahmed, made sure of
thy inheritance unto thee."

"I understand not," muttered Ahmed.

"It is perfectly clear," said the rabbi. "As soon as thou art ready,
thou shalt make thy choice of one thing. Do as I bid thee, and thou
shalt see thy father's wisdom."

Ahmed had no option but to agree. He could find no solution himself, and
wretched though he felt, reason told him that his father loved him and
that the rabbi was renowned for shrewdness.

The townspeople gathered early to hear Ahmed make his choice of one
thing--and one only--from his father's possessions. Ahmed looked less
troubled than they expected, the rabbi wore his most benign expression,
and Pedro stationed himself in his usual place at the door, statuesque,
obedient, and expressionless as ever.

Ahmed held up his hand to obtain silence.

"Acting under the terms of my father's will," he said, solemnly, "at
this moment when all, before division, belongs to his estate, I choose
but one of my father's possessions--Pedro, the black slave."

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

Then everybody saw the wisdom of the strange will, for with Pedro, Ahmed
became possessed of his father's vast wealth.

To Pedro, who still stood motionless, Ahmed said, "And thou, my good
friend, shalt have thy freedom and possessions sufficient to keep thee
in comfort for the rest of thy days."

"I desire naught but to serve thee," Pedro answered, "I wish to remain
the faithful attendant of one who will follow nobly in the footsteps of
thy father."

So everybody was satisfied.
