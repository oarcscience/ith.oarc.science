### CHAPTER III

#### RELATION OF THE KABBALAH TO THE DOCTRINE OF PHILO

Without repeating what has been said before of the relative isolation of
the Jews of Palestine and those of Egypt, we may add that Philo's name
is never mentioned by the Jewish writers of the Middle Ages. Neither
Saadia <span id="fr_503"></span>[1](#fn_503.md) nor Maimonides, <span
id="fr_504"></span>[2](#fn_504.md) neither their later disciples nor the
modern Kabbalists, have dedicated any monument to him, and even now he
is barely known among those of his coreligionists who are strangers to
the Greek literature. <span id="fr_505"></span>[3](#fn_505.md) We shall not
linger, though, upon these external facts, the importance of which we do
not wish to exaggerate. As we have hinted before, we shall look for the
solution of our problem in our philosopher's own opinions, which have
been made clear by the labors of modern criticism. <span
id="fr_506"></span>[4](#fn_506.md)

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

There is nothing in the writings of Philo that can possibly be called a
system. Incongruous opinions in disorderly juxtaposition--I refer to the
symbolic interpretation of the Holy Scriptures--serve a most arbitrary
method. All the elements of this chaos which are held together by one
common bond--the innate desire of the author to demonstrate in the
Hebrew writings the presence of the highest and purest in the wisdom of
other nations--may be divided into two big classes. The elements of one
class have been borrowed from the philosophic systems of Greece, systems
which are not irreconcilable with the fundamental principles of any
moral or religious teaching, like that of Pythagoras, Aristotle and
Zeno; <span id="fr_508"></span>[5](#fn_508.md) but above all that of Plato,
whose language and ideas make up the first sketch, so to speak, in all
the writings of the Hebrew philosopher. The elements of the other class
visibly betray, by the contempt they instill for reason and science, by
the impatience with which they precipitate in some manner the human soul
into the bosom of the infinite, their foreign origin, and can come only
from the Orient. This dualism of the Philonic ideas is of the greatest
importance, not only for the problem we are to solve, but for the
history of philosophy in general; and we shall first of all endeavor to
determine it definitely, at least, on the points most salient and most
worthy of our interest.

When speaking of the creation and of the first principles of beings, of
God and of His relations to the universe, Philo has evidently two
doctrines in mind, doctrines that can never be brought in accord by any
effort of logic. One doctrine is simply the dualism of Plato as taught
in Timaeus; the other reminds us at once of Plotinus and the Kabbalah.
We shall take up the first doctrine which, singularly, is placed in the
mouth of Moses: "The legislator of the Hebrews," says our author in his
Treatise

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

on the Creation, <span id="fr_509"></span>[6](#fn_509.md) "recognized two
equally necessary principles, one active and the other passive. The
first is the highest and absolute Intelligence which is above virtue,
above knowledge, above the good and the beautiful itself; the second is
the inert and inanimate matter which became perfect by receiving motion,
form and life from Intelligence."

To avoid taking the last principle as a pure abstraction, Philo takes
care to repeat in another work <span id="fr_510"></span>[7](#fn_510.md) the
famous maxim of Pagan antiquity, that there is neither absolute
beginning nor absolute annihilation, but that the same elements pass
from one form to another. These elements are earth, water, air and fire.
We are taught that, in order to make the world a work fully accomplished
and worthy of the supreme architect, God left no particle outside of the
world. <span id="fr_511"></span>[8](#fn_511.md) But before giving form to
matter and existence to this sensual universe, God visualized in His
thought the intelligible universe or the prototypes, the incorruptible
ideas of things. <span id="fr_512"></span>[9](#fn_512.md) Divine kindness,
which is the only cause of the formation of the world, <span
id="fr_513"></span>[10](#fn_513.md) explains also why the world should not
perish. God can not, without discontinuing His goodness, wish to replace
order and general harmony by chaos; and to imagine a better world which
is some day to replace ours, is to accuse God of having failed in His
goodness towards

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

the present order of things. <span id="fr_514"></span>[11](#fn_514.md)
According to this system the generation of beings, or the application of
the power which formed the universe, must have necessarily commenced,
but it can not continue to act endlessly; for God can not destroy the
already formed world by producing another; matter can not return to
general chaos. Moreover, God is not the immanent cause of the beings,
neither is He the creative cause in the modern theological sense. He is
only the Supreme Architect, the Demiurge, and this is really the term
Philo makes use of when he is under the influence of the Greek
philosophy. <span id="fr_515"></span>[12](#fn_515.md) Finally, God is not
only above, but completely apart from the creation (ὁ ἐπιβεβηκὼς τῷ
κόσμῳ καὶ ἔξω τοῦ δημιουργηθέντος ὤν) (De Posteritate Caini); for,
possessing infinite knowledge and felicity, He can have no relation to a
formless and unclean substance as matter is. <span
id="fr_516"></span>[13](#fn_516.md)

Let us now try to harmonize these principles with the following
doctrines: God never rests in His works, but it is His nature always to
produce, just as it is the nature of fire to burn, and that of snow to
diffuse cold. <span id="fr_517"></span>[14](#fn_517.md) Rest, as applied to
God, does not mean inactivity; for the active cause of the universe can
never cease to produce the most beautiful works. But we say that God
rests, because His endless activity works spontaneously (μετὰ πολλῆς
εὐμαρείας), without pain and without fatigue. <span
id="fr_518"></span>[15](#fn_518.md) It is also absurd to take literally the
words of the Scriptures which tell us that the world was created in six
days. Far from lasting but six days, creation did not even commence in
*time*.

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For, according to
Plato, time itself was created with other things, and is but a fleeting
image of eternity. <span id="fr_519"></span>[16](#fn_519.md) Divine action,
as was said before, does not only give form to inert matter, and causes
the departure of all the elements necessary for the formation of the
world from disorder and darkness, but it becomes really creative and
absolute; it is limited neither in space nor in time.

"In giving rise to things," says Philo expressly, "God did not only make
them visible, but He produced what did not exist before. He is not only
the architect (the Demiurge) of the universe, He is also its
creator." <span id="fr_520"></span>[17](#fn_520.md) He is the principle of
all action in each particular being, as well as in the totality of
things, for to Him alone belongs activity; passivity is in the nature of
all things engendered. <span id="fr_521"></span>[18](#fn_521.md) It is
probably because of this that everything is filled with and penetrated
by His presence; and it is also because of this that He does not permit
anything to stay void of and abandoned by Him. <span
id="fr_522"></span>[19](#fn_522.md) But as there is nothing that can
embrace the Infinite, He is, therefore, nowhere and everywhere at the
same time, an antithesis which we heard already from the mouth of
Porphyrius, and which was understood in the same sense as it was later
understood by the disciples of Plotinus. God is nowhere because, place
and space were created with the bodies, and we can not therefore say
that the creator is confined in the creature. He is everywhere because
He penetrates [simultaneously](errata.htm#22.md), by His various potencies
(τὰς δυνάμεις αὐτοῦ), earth and water,

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

air and heaven. <span id="fr_523"></span>[20](#fn_523.md) He fills the
least particle of the universe, uniting each other by invisible
bonds. <span id="fr_524"></span>[21](#fn_524.md)

But this is not enough. God Himself is the place of the universe (ὁ τῶν
ὅλων τόπος) for He embraces all things, He is the shelter of the
universe and His own seat, the place wherein He confines Himself and
where He contains Himself. <span id="fr_525"></span>[22](#fn_525.md) When
Malebranche (French philos. 1638-1715.--Trans.), who saw in God the
place of spirits only, appears to us so close to Spinoza, what are we to
think of one who represents the Supreme Being as the place of all the
existences, of the spirits as well as of the bodies? But we must also
ask what becomes of this idea of the passive principle of the universe?
How are we to conceive as a real and necessary being that matter which
has neither form nor activity in itself, which must have existed, and
which, together with space, was transported into the bosom of God? And
Philo is really driven by an irresistible inclination to pronounce the
great words: *God is All* (εἷς καὶ τὸ πᾶν ἀυτος ἐστιν). (Legis. Alleg.,
I, 1.)

But how did the Supreme Being cause to spring forth from this
intelligible place, which is His own substance, an actual space
containing this material and sensual world? How did He, Who is all
activity and all intelligence, produce passive and inactive beings? The
mementos of Greek philosophy are here entirely stifled by the language
and the ideas of the Orient. God is the purest light, the prototype and
source of all light. He sheds around Him innumerable rays of light, all
intelligibles, which no

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

creature can behold; <span id="fr_526"></span>[23](#fn_526.md) but His
image is reflected in His thought (in His logos), and it is by this
image alone that we can comprehend Him. <span
id="fr_527"></span>[24](#fn_527.md) Here we see already a first
manifestation, or, as is generally said, a first emanation of divine
nature. For, when the Platonic reminiscence of Philo make way to. other
influences, the divine word becomes with him a real being, a person or a
hypostasis, as it was later said in the Alexandrian school. Of such
nature is the archangel who commands all celestial armies. <span
id="fr_528"></span>[25](#fn_528.md)

But our philosopher does not stop at this point. From this first logos,
ordinarily called "the most ancient" (ὁ πρεσβύτατος), the
[firstborn](errata.htm#23.md) of God, which represents in the absolute
sphere the "Thought" (λόγος ἐνδιάθετος), there emanates another which
represents the "Word" (λόγος προφορικός), that is to say, the creative
power, the manifestation of which is the world. When we read in Genesis
that a river went forth from Eden to water the garden, it means that the
generic goodness is an emanation of the Divine Wisdom which is the Word
of God <span id="fr_529"></span>[26](#fn_529.md) The author of this
universe should be called both the architect as well as the father of
His work. Supreme Wisdom we shall call the mother. It is with Supreme
Wisdom that God united in a mysterious manner to make the generation of
things operative. Impregnated with the divine germ, Supreme Wisdom gave
birth, in pain and at the appointed time, the only well-beloved son whom
we call the world. It is for this reason that a sacred writer presents
to us Wisdom as speaking of itself in the following manner: "Of all the
works of God I was the first to be formed; time was not yet when I
already existed. For everything that is

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

engendered must naturally be younger than the mother and the nurse of
the universe." <span id="fr_530"></span>[27](#fn_530.md)

There is a passage in Timaeus where we meet with nearly the same
language, but with the vast difference that the mother and nurse of all
things is a principle entirely apart from God; it is the inert and
formless matter <span id="fr_531"></span>[28](#fn_531.md) The quoted
passages remind us more of the ideas and the usual expressions of the
Zohar. There, too, God is called the eternal light; there, too, the
generation of things is metaphorically explained by the gradual
darkening of the rays emanating from the divine center, and by the union
of God with Himself in His diverse attributes. Springing from the bosom
of God to give life to the universe, Supreme Wisdom is also represented
by the river which went forth from the earthly paradise. The two logi,
finally, remind us of the Kabbalistic principle that the world is
nothing but the word of God; that His word or His voice is His thought
become visible, and that His thought, finally, is Himself. Another
picture, often drawn in the principal work of the Kabbalah, shows us the
universe as a cloak or garment of God. Now then, we have here the same
in the following words of Philo: "The Supreme Being is surrounded by a
dazzling light which envelops Him like a rich cloak, and the most
ancient word covers itself with the world as with a garment." <span
id="fr_532"></span>[29](#fn_532.md)

Two ways of speaking of God result also from this twofold theory on the
nature and birth of things in general when

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He is considered
for Himself, in His proper essence and independent of the creation.
Sometime He is the supreme reason of things, the active and efficient
cause of the universe (ὁ νοῦς, τὸ δραστήριον αἴτιον), the most general
idea (τὸ γενικώτατον), (Legis. Alleg., II) the intelligible nature
(νοητὴ φύσις). To Him alone belongs liberty, knowledge, joy, peace and
happiness, in short--perfection. <span id="fr_533"></span>[30](#fn_533.md)
Sometime He is represented higher even than perfection and all possible
attributes. Nothing can give us an idea of Him; neither virtue nor
knowledge, neither beauty nor goodness, <span
id="fr_534"></span>[31](#fn_534.md) not even unity. For what we call unity
is but an image of the first cause (μονὰς μὲν ἐστιν εἰκὼν αἰτίου
πρώτου), <span id="fr_535"></span>[32](#fn_535.md),  <span
id="fr_536"></span>[33](#fn_536.md) All we know of Him is that He exists;
to us He is the ineffable and nameless being. <span
id="fr_537"></span>[34](#fn_537.md)

We easily recognize in the first case the influence of Plato, of the
metaphysics of Aristotle, and even of the physiology of the stoics; in
the second case there is an entirely different order of ideas. Here, the
Neoplatonic unity and the Ayn Sof of the Kabbalah, the "Mystery of
Mysteries," the "Unknown of the Unknown" which dominates both, the
Sefiroth and the world, are clearly visible. This applies also
necessarily to all that Philo, because of his religious belief or
because of his philosophic views, presents to us as an intermediary
between the things created and the purest essence of God; we refer to
the angels, the Word, and in general to what Philo designates under the
somewhat vague name of "Divine Powers (δυνάμεις τοῦ Θεοῦ)." When the

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Greek dualism is
taken seriously, when the intelligent principle acts directly upon
matter, and God is conceived as the Demiurge of the world, then the Word
or the Logos is the divine idea, the seat of all ideas after which all
things have been patterned. The forces and the messengers of God, that
is, the angels of every degree of the celestial hierarchy, are the ideas
themselves.

This viewpoint is expressed already in the following short fragments:
"If we are to speak prosaically, then the intelligible world is nothing
but the thought of God while He prepared Himself to create the world,
just as an architect who has the ideal city in his mind before
constructing the real city according to this plan. Now, just as this
ideal city occupies no space, and is but a picture in the mind of the
architect, so can the intelligible world be nowhere but in the divine
thought where the plan for the material universe was conceived. There is
no other place capable of receiving and embracing even a single one of
these unadulterated forces, much less all the forces of the supreme
intelligence." <span id="fr_538"></span>[35](#fn_538.md) "These are the
forces which have formed the immaterial and intelligible world, the
prototype of the visible and the corporeal world." <span
id="fr_539"></span>[36](#fn_539.md) In another place <span
id="fr_540"></span>[37](#fn_540.md) we are told that the divine forces and
the ideas are one and the same; that their task is to give the
appropriate form to each object. In the same manner, nearly, the angels
are referred to. They represent different particular forms of the
everlasting reason or of virtue, and inhabit the divine space, that is
to say, the intelligible world. <span id="fr_541"></span>[38](#fn_541.md)

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

The power upon which they depend directly, or the archangel, is, as we
already know, the logos itself. But this nature of things and these
roles are entirely changed when, according to the conception of the
author, God appears as the immanent cause and the true place of all
beings. In this case we are not dealing any longer with the simple
imprint of different forms upon matter that does not exist of its own
essence; but, without losing anything of their intelligible value, all
ideas become, in addition, substantial realities, active forces
subordinated one to another, and yet bound in one substance, in one
force, in one single intelligence.

Wisdom or the Word thus becomes the first of all the heavenly forces, a
distinct power, but not separated from the absolute being, <span
id="fr_542"></span>[39](#fn_542.md) the spring that waters and vivifies the
earth, the cup-bearer of the Most High who pours out the nectar of the
souls, and Who is itself this nectar; <span
id="fr_543"></span>[40](#fn_543.md) the firstborn of God and the mother of
all the beings (υἱὸς πρωτόγονος), <span id="fr_544"></span>[41](#fn_544.md)
It is also called the divine man (ἄνθρωπος Θεοῦ), for the image in which
the earthly man was created on the sixth day, and which the Holy
Scriptures call the image of God, is nothing but the everlasting
Word. <span id="fr_545"></span>[42](#fn_545.md) It is the high priest of
the universe (ἀρχιερεὺς τοῦ χόσμου), that is to say, the conciliator
between the finite and the infinite. It may be regarded as a second God
without impairing the belief in one God. <span
id="fr_546"></span>[43](#fn_546.md) The Scriptures have it in mind when
titles and a

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

name are sometimes bestowed upon God; for the first rank belongs to the
ineffable being <span id="fr_547"></span>[44](#fn_547.md) Philo's assertion
that the Word reveals itself sometimes to a man in a material form fully
convinces us that these expressions refer to a real personification. It
is the Word that the patriarch Jacob saw in a dream, and it is the Word
again that spoke to Moses in the burning bush. (Ib. supra.)

We have already seen how this Supreme Word engenders another which
springs from its bosom by way of emanation, like a river gushing from
its source. This second word is the goodness, the creative virtue
(δύναμις ποιητικὴ), a hypostatized Platonic idea. Below the goodness is
the royal power (ἡ βασιλικὴ) which governs with justice all created
beings. <span id="fr_548"></span>[45](#fn_548.md) These three forces, the
two last ones of which, when confined in their action to man only, are
called "Mercy" and "Judgment" (ἡ ἵλεως καὶ ἡ νομοθετική), revealed
themselves once upon the earth under the disguise of the three angels
who visited Abraham. <span id="fr_549"></span>[46](#fn_549.md) They make up
the invisible good and the harmony of this world, just as they are, on
the other hand, the glory, the presence of God, whence they descend by a
gradual darkening of the infinite splendor; for each one of them is both
shadow and light; shadow of that which is above, light and life of all
that is below their own sphere. <span id="fr_550"></span>[47](#fn_550.md)

Their essence, finally, is just as impossible to comprehend as that of
the primitive being, although their action is present everywhere and
their forms manifest themselves in the forms of the universe. It is just
what God Himself had taught Moses when the latter implored Him, says
Philo, to show him at least, His glory (τὴν Δόξαν αὐτοῦ), that is to
say, the forces that surround His inaccessible throne (δορυφορούσας
δυνάμεις), after asking

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Him in vain to see
Him face to face. <span id="fr_551"></span>[48](#fn_551.md) The angels
which we just saw described as ideas representing different kinds of
virtue, are not only personified after the manner of poets and biblical
writers, but they are also looked upon as souls floating in ether and
sometimes uniting with souls inhabiting human bodies. <span
id="fr_552"></span>[49](#fn_552.md) They form real and animated substances
which impart life to all elements and to all parts of nature. Proof of
it is the following passage which we shall translate: "The beings
designated by the philosophers of other nations as demons, are called by
Moses angels. These are the souls that float in the air, and no one must
deny their existence; for the universe must be animated in all its
parts, and each element must be inhabited by living beings. The earth is
thus stocked with animals, the sea and rivers with the inhabitants of
water, the fire with the salamander--supposed to be quite common in
Macedonia--the heavens by the stars. In fact, if the stars were not pure
and divine souls, they would not be endowed with circular motion which
properly belongs to the spirit only. It follows, therefore, that the air
must also be peopled by living beings, although our eyes can not see
them." <span id="fr_553"></span>[50](#fn_553.md)

Philo's syncretism shows itself most plainly, and the twofold direction
to which he commits himself, notwithstanding his lively predilection for
Oriental ideas, is most easily seen, when he comes to speak of man.
Thus, unlike Plato, he is not content with seeing the pale imprint of
the eternal ideas in material things; but he even maintains that without
the help of the senses we can never rise to higher cognition, that
without the spectacle of the material world we can not even suspect the
existence of an immaterial and invisible world. <span
id="fr_554"></span>[51](#fn_554.md) He then declares the influence

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

of the senses to be absolutely harmful, and commands man to sever all
connections with them and to take refuge within himself. He creates an
abyss between the rational, intelligent soul, which alone is privileged
to constitute man, and the sentient soul from which our organs borrow
life as well as the knowledge appropriate to them. This soul resides, as
Moses said, in the blood, <span id="fr_555"></span>[52](#fn_555.md) while
the other is an emanation, an inseparable reflection of divine nature
(ἀπόσπασμα οὐ διαιρετόν, ἀπαύγασμα Θείας φύσεως) <span
id="fr_556"></span>[53](#fn_556.md)

This exaggerated viewpoint does not prevent him from retaining the
Platonic opinion which recognizes in the human soul three elements: the
thought, the will and the passions. <span
id="fr_557"></span>[54](#fn_557.md) In innumerable places he insists upon
the necessity of preparing for wisdom by what he calls "encyclical
sciences" (ἐγκύκλιος παιδεία, ἐγκύκλια μαθήματα), that is to say, by
oratory and those sciences which produce that outward culture so dear to
the Greeks. Our mind, he says, must be fed with this mundane knowledge
before it can aspire to higher science, just as our body must be fed
with milk before it can bear more substantial food. <span
id="fr_558"></span>[55](#fn_558.md) Any one neglecting to acquire these
must succumb in this world as Abel succumbed to the blows of his
fratricidal brother.

In another place he teaches entirely to the contrary: The word and the
outward appearance is to be scorned, just as the body and the senses are
to be scorned, that we may live in the intelligence and in the
contemplation of the naked truth only. God's command to Abraham to leave
his country, his family and the house of his father, means that man must
break away from his body, his senses and the word. For the body is but
part of the earth where we are forced to live; the senses are the
servants

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

and the brothers of the thought; and the word, finally, is but the cover
and, in some measure, the dwelling place of the intelligence which is
our real father. (De Somniis, L, 1.)

The same thought is symbolically reproduced in a more expressive manner
by Hagar and Ishmael. This, rebellious servant and her son, who were so
ignominiously driven from the house of their master, represent the
encyclical knowledge and the sophism it begets. It is hardly necessary
to add that any one aspiring to a higher level of the spiritual world
must imitate the Hebrew patriarch. <span
id="fr_559"></span>[56](#fn_559.md) But does the soul, when fully retired
in the intelligence, find there, at least, self-satisfaction and the
means of arriving through its own efforts to truth and wisdom? Had Philo
answered this question in the affirmative, he would no have gone beyond
the doctrine of Plato. For in Plato's estimation only he is truly wise
who entirely renounces body and senses, and labors hard all his life to
learn how to die. (Phedon, ad init.) But our Alexandrian philosopher
oversteps this boundary; for, besides the knowledge borrowed from
reason, besides the enlightenment given by philosophy, he is also in
need of enlightenment and of higher knowledge, emanating directly from
God, and given to intelligence as a favor, a mysterious gift.

When we read in the Scriptures, he says, that God spoke to man, we are
not to believe that a material voice verberated the air, but that the
human soul had been illumined by the purest light. In this manner only
can the divine word address itself to man. Again, when the Law was
promulgated on the Mount Sinai, it is not said that a voice was heard,
but, according to the text, a voice was seen by all the people
assembled. "You have seen," says Jehovah, "that I spoke to you from
heaven above." <span id="fr_560"></span>[57](#fn_560.md) Since a miracle is
explained it can not refer here to rational knowledge or to a mere
contemplation of ideas but to a revelation

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

mystically understood. We shall give the same meaning to another passage
where the possibility of grasping God Himself through direct
manifestation (ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ αὐτὸν καταλαμβάνειν) is admitted, instead of
rising to Him by the contemplation of His works. In this state, adds our
author, we understand at a glance the essence of God, His word and the
universe. <span id="fr_561"></span>[58](#fn_561.md) He recognizes Faith
(πίστις), which he calls "the queen of virtues" (ἡ τῶν ἀρετῶν βασιλίς),
as the most perfect of all goodness, the cement that unites us with
divine nature. <span id="fr_562"></span>[59](#fn_562.md) It is Faith that
is represented in the story of Judah and Tamar; for as he united himself
with her without lifting the veil that covered her face, so does Faith
unite us with God.

Philo shows the same hesitation when speaking of human liberty as when
explaining the nature and origin of our knowledge. At times the Stoic
doctrine that man is free triumphs; the laws of necessity which govern
without exception all other creatures, do not exist for man. This free
choice, then, which is his privilege, imposes upon him at the same time
the responsibility for his actions; only thus is man alone among all
other beings capable of virtue, and hereby alone are we justified in
saying that God, in His desire to manifest Himself in the universe
through the idea of goodness, found no more dignified a temple than the
human soul. <span id="fr_563"></span>[60](#fn_563.md) But it is easily seen
that this theory, so true and wise, contradicts certain general
principles previously expounded; as the unity of substance, the
formation of beings by way of emanation, and even the Platonic dualism.

Our philosopher has also no scruples in deserting this theory for
opposite views, and it is readily noted that he finds himself there more
at ease, and that he unfolds there much better the

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

wealth of his half-oriental style and the resources of his natural
genius. He takes there from man his free choice as well as his moral
responsibility. The evil we attribute to ourselves as the one generally
reigning in this world, is the inevitable fruit of matter, <span
id="fr_564"></span>[61](#fn_564.md) or the work of inferior forces which
took part with the divine logos in the formation of man. The good, on
the contrary, belongs to God alone. It is really because it does not
suit the Supreme Being to participate in evil, that He called for
subordinate workers to co-operate with Him in the creation of Adam, but
all the good in our actions and in our thoughts must be attributed to
Him alone. <span id="fr_565"></span>[62](#fn_565.md)

According to this principle it is boastful and impious to consider
oneself the author of any work; it means to compare oneself with God Who
alone deposited in our soul the germ of good, and Who alone is qualified
to impregnate it. <span id="fr_566"></span>[63](#fn_566.md) This quality,
without which we would be swallowed up by evil and blended with
nothingness or matter, is called by Philo by its true name, it is the
"Grace (ἡ χάρις)." "Grace," he says, "is the heavenly virgin who serves
as mediatress between God and the soul; between God who holds forth, and
the soul which receives. The entire written law is but a symbol of
Grace." <span id="fr_567"></span>[64](#fn_567.md)

Along with this quite mysterious influence, Philo admits another
influence which endangers no less the moral responsibility, and
consequently, the free choice. It is the reversibility of good. The
righteous is the expiatory victim of the wicked, and it is for the sake
of the righteous that God lavishes upon the

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

wicked His inexhaustible treasures. <span
id="fr_568"></span>[65](#fn_568.md) This dogma, equally adopted by the
Kabbalists and applied by them to the entire universe, is fundamentally
a development of Grace. Grace alone brings about the merit of the
righteous; why, then, can it not also come by the same channel to the
wicked? As to that other obstacle to human liberty--the original sin--it
would not be impossible to find its definition in some isolated words of
our author. <span id="fr_569"></span>[66](#fn_569.md) But in such an
important subject we must expect more explicit and more definite proofs.
We can positively state that Philo considered life itself as a state of
forfeiture and of compulsion; consequently, the more man enters life, or
the further he penetrates through will or through intelligence the realm
of nature, the more he must have believed that man wanders from God,
that he becomes perverted and degraded. This principle is almost the
only foundation of Philo's morality, which we shall survey rapidly.

While we meet here with some contradictions now and then, yet the Greek
influence extends to the language only; the back-ground is entirely
oriental and mystic. For example, when Philo tells us, as Antisthenes
and Zeno do, that we must live according to nature (ζῆν ὁμολογουμένως τῇ
φύσει), he understands by human nature not only the entire domination of
spirit over body, of reason over senses, but also the observation of all
the revealed laws, undoubtedly, as interpreted and understood by
him. <span id="fr_570"></span>[67](#fn_570.md) When he admits, like Plato
and the Stoic school, what was later called the "four cardinal virtues,"
he represents them, at the same time, as inferior and purely human
virtues; above these he shows us, as their common source, the goodness
or love, a purely religious virtue which concerns itself with God alone,
Whose

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

image and purest emanation it is. It springs directly from the Eden,
that is to say, from Divine Wisdom, where alone joy, pleasure and
delight in God is found. <span id="fr_571"></span>[68](#fn_571.md) It is
probably in this sense, and following the example of Socrates, that he
identifies virtue with wisdom. <span id="fr_572"></span>[69](#fn_572.md)

We must, finally, take care not to attribute to him Aristotle's thoughts
when, following the expressions of that philosopher, he says that virtue
may come from three sources--from knowledge, nature and exercise. <span
id="fr_573"></span>[70](#fn_573.md) True science and wisdom, according to
Philo, is not the one which results from a natural development of our
intelligence, but the one given to us by the grace of God. According to
the Greek philosopher it is nature itself that drives us towards the
good; according to Philo, there are in man two entirely contrary natures
which combat each other, and one of which must necessarily succumb;
thenceforth both are in a state of violence and restraint which does not
permit them to remain at rest. Whence his third expedient to attain
moral perfection: asceticism in its highest degree as a substitute for
the legitimate control of the will and reason over our desires. In fact,
it is not only the question here of lessening evil and of confining it
to more or less restricted limits, but it must be pursued as long as the
least trace of it is visible; it must be destroyed, if possible, root
and branch. For the evil we suffer from in this world is entirely in our
passions which Philo considers absolutely foreign to the nature of the
soul. <span id="fr_574"></span>[71](#fn_574.md) The passions, to use his
language, have their origin in the flesh. The flesh, therefore, must be
humiliated and mortified; it must be combatted under all forms

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

and in all instances; <span id="fr_575"></span>[72](#fn_575.md) we must
lift ourselves from this state of forfeiture which is called life; we
must regain liberty in the very bosom of that prison which we call body
by absolute indifference to all perishable possessions. <span
id="fr_576"></span>[73](#fn_576.md)

As this state of misery is the purpose and result of marriage, the
latter is considered by Philo, without being openly condemned, as a
humiliating necessity from which the select souls, at least, ought to
liberate themselves. <span id="fr_577"></span>[74](#fn_577.md) These,
approximately, are the principal characteristics of the ascetic life,
more so conceived and shown to us by Philo, than he has seen it realized
by the sect of the Therapeutics. But the ascetic life is only a means;
its aim, that is to say, the aim of morality itself, the highest degree
of perfection, of happiness and of existence, is the union of the soul
with God through total forgetfulness of itself, through enthusiasm and
through love.

Here are some passages which we may believe to have been borrowed from
some mystic of modern times: "O, my soul! If you desire to inherit
heavenly gifts, it is not only necessary, as our first patriarch did, to
leave the land you inhabit, that is to say, your body; the family you
were born in, that is to say, the senses; and the house of your father,
or the word; you must also avoid yourself that you may be outside of
you, like those corybants who are intoxicated with divine enthusiasm.
For the inheritance of heavenly blessing is only there where the soul,
full of enthusiasm, does not live any more in itself, but plunges with
delight into divine love and, attracted, ascends towards its father.
(Quis rerum Divinarum haeres sit.) Once delivered from all passion, the
soul pours itself out like a pure libation before the Lord. For to pour
one's soul before God, to break the chains we find in the vain cares of
this perishable life, means to step out

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

of one's self to reach the limits of the universe, and to enjoy the
heavenly sight of Him Who always was." (De Ebrietate.) The contemplative
life--although it may not be the only one for man to choose--is placed
by such principles far above all social virtues whose principle is love
and whose aim is the well-being of man. <span
id="fr_578"></span>[75](#fn_578.md) Even the cult-.--I mean the outward
cult--can not bring us to the aim we are to look for.

Philo is really very [embarrassed](errata.htm#25.md) on this point. "Just
as we must," he says, "take care of the body, since it is the dwelling
place of the soul, just so must we observe the written laws; for the
truer we will be to them, the better will we understand things they
symbolize. In addition to this we must avoid the blame and the
accusations of the masses." <span id="fr_579"></span>[76](#fn_579.md) This
last reason resembles very much the postscript of some letters. This
alone expresses the thought of our philosopher and establishes a closer
relation between him and the Kabbalists. It also justifies the opinion
the Talmudists had of their brethren who were initiated in Greek
learning.

Of what has been said until now we obtain two extremely important
deductions with reference to the origin of the Kabbalah. The first
deduction is that this traditional doctrine was not taken from the
writings of Philo. Indeed, since all Greek systems--and we may even say
the entire Greek [civilization](errata.htm#26.md)--have left so many
traces, intimately blended with elements of another nature, in the
writings of Philo, why do we not find the same condition in the oldest
writings of the Kabbalistic science? We say it again, that we can never
find, either in the Zohar or in the Book of Formation, the least trace
of that splendid civilization which has been transplanted by the
Ptolemies to Egyptian soil. Without mentioning the previously indicated
external difficulties which we

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

uphold here in their full force, is it possible that Simeon ben Yohai
and his friends, or whoever the authors of the Zohar may have been,
could differentiate in Philo's writings, if these were their only guide,
between that which has been borrowed from the different Greek
philosophers, whose names are seldom mentioned by their Alexandrian
disciples, and that which belongs to another doctrine which is based
upon the idea of one and immanent principle which is the substance and
form of all beings? Such a supposition is unworthy of discussion.

Besides, what we designated as the oriental part of Philo's syncretism
is far from corresponding in all important points with the mysticism
taught by the Palestinian sages. Thus, according to Philo, there are
only five divine forces or attributes, while the Kabbalists admit ten
Sefiroth. Although enthusiastically expounding the doctrine, Philo
nevertheless preserves always a certain dualism, the (absolute) Being
and the forces, or the substance and the attributes which, according to
him, are separated by an impassable abyss. The Kabbalists look upon the
Sefiroth as diverse boundaries within which the absolute principle of
things circumscribes itself, or as "vessels," to use their own mode of
expression. The divine substance, they add, need only withdraw, and
these vessels would break and waste. Let us also remember that they
expressly taught the identity of existence with thought. Philo, who is
unconsciously dominated by the idea (of Plato and Anaxogoras) that
matter is a principle distinct from God and everlasting as He, is
naturally led to consider life a forfeiture and the body a prison.

This also accounts for his contempt of marriage, which he regards merely
as a gratification of the flesh. The Kabbalists, on the other hand,
although agreeing with the Scriptures that in the first days of the
creation, when he was not ruled by sensual passions, man was happier
than now, still look upon life in general as a necessary trial, as a
means through which finite beings like we may elevate themselves to God,
and unite with Him in

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

boundless love. Marriage to them is not only the symbol, but the
beginning, the first condition of this mysterious union; they carry
marriage into the soul and into heaven. It is the fusion of two human
souls by mutual completion. The interpretative system, finally, which
Philo applies to the Holy Scriptures, although basically identical with
that of the Kabbalists, could not, however, have served as a pattern to
the latter.

Philo was surely not entirely ignorant of the language of his fathers;
but we can easily prove that he had only the Septuagint version before
him, the version that was used also by all the Alexandrian Jews. His
mystic interpretations are based mainly upon the expressions of this
translation and upon a purely Greek etymology. <span
id="fr_580"></span>[77](#fn_580.md) Now, then, what is to become of those
ingenious procedures used in the Zohar, whose force is entirely
destroyed if not applied to the sacred language? <span
id="fr_581"></span>[78](#fn_581.md) Nevertheless we admit that this
difference in form would not be of such very great importance to us, if
Philo and the Kabbalists were always to agree upon the choice of the
texts, the Scriptural passages upon which they base their philosophical
system; or, indeed, if disregarding the language, the same symbols would
call forth the same ideas. But this is never so. Thus we do not find,
either in the Zohar or in the Book of Formation, the least trace of
those rich and ingenious allegories which we consider the sole property
of the Alexandrian philosopher. No mention is made in these

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

works of the personification of the senses in woman, of Eve, our first
mother; of voluptuousness in the serpent which advised evil; of egotism
in Cain, which man brought forth by uniting with Eve, that is to say,
with the senses, after listening to the advice of the serpent; of the
mental type in Abel, which entirely despises the body and succumbs
through ignorance of mundane things; of the divine science in Abraham;
of mundane science in Haggar; of virtue in Sarah; of the primitive
nature of regenerated man in Isaac; of ascetic virtue in Jacob, and of
faith in Tamar. All these reasons, we believe, justify our saying that
Philo's writings exerted no influence whatever upon the Kabbalah.

We come now to the second deduction which may be drawn from these
writings, and from the character of their writer. We have seen how
indiscriminately and with what disregard for sound logic Philo pillaged,
so to speak, the entire Greek philosophy. What reason have we, then, to
credit him with better inventiveness, more sagacity and greater depth in
that part of his opinions which reminds us, at least, of the dominant
principles of the Kabbalistic system? Are we not justified in thinking
that he found also this part all ready made in certain preserved
traditions of his co-religionists, and that he only trimmed it with the
brilliant colors of his imagination? In this case these traditions were
quite old; for Egypt must have received them from the Holy Land before
the memory of Jerusalem and of the language of their fathers was
entirely extinguished among the Alexandrian Jews.

But, fortunately, we need not rely upon conjectures. There are facts
which prove conclusively that some of the ideas we now speak of were
known more than a century before the Christian era. We are assured by
Philo himself, as we have said before, that he had drawn from an oral
tradition which was preserved by the elders of his people, <span
id="fr_582"></span>[79](#fn_582.md) attributing to the sect of the
Therapeutists the mystic books of a very remote antiquity (De Vita
contemplativa) and the use of allegorical interpretations applied

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

without exception and without reserve to all parts of the Holy
Scriptures. "The entire law," he says, "is to them like a living being
in which the body is represented by the letter and the soul by a very
deep meaning. Through the words, as through a mirror, the rational soul
perceives in the latter the most hidden and the most extraordinary
wonders." <span id="fr_583"></span>[80](#fn_583.md) Let us keep in mind
that the same comparison is used in the Zohar, with the difference that
beneath the body is put the cloak of the law by which the material deeds
of the Bible are designated, and that above the soul is placed a more
saintly soul, that is to say, the Divine Word, source of all inspiration
and of all truth. But we have still older and more reliable witnesses
than Philo.

We shall begin with the most important of all, the famous version of the
Septuagint. The Talmud already had a vague knowledge <span
id="fr_584"></span>[81](#fn_584.md) of the numerous inaccuracies met with
in this famous translation, yet it venerated it very highly. Modern
criticism has conclusively proven that the translation was made in
behalf of a system extremely hostile <span
id="fr_585"></span>[82](#fn_585.md) to biblical anthropomorphism; and there
we will find the germ of Philo's mysticism. <span
id="fr_586"></span>[83](#fn_586.md) Thus, when the sacred text expressly
states <span id="fr_587"></span>[84](#fn_587.md) that Moses, his brother
and the seventy elders saw the God of Israel sitting upon a throne of
sapphire, the Greek translation says that it is not God they have seen,
but the place He dwells in. <span id="fr_588"></span>[85](#fn_588.md) When
another prophet, Isaiah, sees God sitting upon His throne and the folds
of His robe filling

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

the temple, (Isaiah, VI, I) the Septuagint replaces this too material
picture by the "glory of God," the Shekinah of the Hebrews. <span
id="fr_589"></span>[86](#fn_589.md) Jehovah really does not speak to Moses
face to face, but in a vision; and it is probable that in the mind of
the translator this vision was only an intellectual one. <span
id="fr_590"></span>[87](#fn_590.md)

Until here we see only the destruction of anthropomorphism and the
desire to disengage the idea of God from the, sometimes, sublime images
which put Him beyond our intelligence. But here are matters more worthy
of our interest. Instead of "Lord Zebaot," the God of Hosts, Whom the
Bible represents as another Mars exciting the fury of war and Himself
marching into battle, <span id="fr_591"></span>[88](#fn_591.md) we find in
the Greek translation not the Supreme God, but the forces of which Philo
speaks so much in his writings, and the Lord, the God of the forces
(κύριος ὁ Θεὸς τῶν δυνάμειων). When comparison is made to the "dew born
from the bosom of Aurora," <span id="fr_592"></span>[89](#fn_592.md) the
anonymous translator substitutes for it that mysterious being which God
brought forth from His bosom before the morning star, <span
id="fr_593"></span>[90](#fn_593.md) that is to say, the Logos, the divine
light which preceded the world and the stars. When speaking of Adam and
Eve, the Septuagint is careful to adhere strictly to the text that God
created them male and female. <span id="fr_594"></span>[91](#fn_594.md) But
this twofold character, these two halves of humanity, are united in one
and the same being, which is evidently the prototype man, the Adam
Kadmon. <span id="fr_595"></span>[92](#fn_595.md)

In this curious monument we can also find unquestionable traces of the
theory of numbers and of ideas. For example:

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> God is not the
creator of heaven and earth in the ordinary sense of the word; He simply
made them visible from the invisible state in which they were
previously. <span id="fr_596"></span>[93](#fn_596.md) "Who created all
these?" asks the Hebrew prophet; "Who made them visible?" <span
id="fr_597"></span>[94](#fn_597.md) says the AIexandrian interpreter. When
the same prophet represents the master of the universe commanding the
stars like a numerous army, <span id="fr_598"></span>[95](#fn_598.md) our
interpreter makes him say that God produced the world according to
numbers. <span id="fr_599"></span>[96](#fn_599.md) While an allusion to the
doctrines of Plato and Pythagoras is easily found in these diverse
passages, we must not forget that the theory of numbers is also taught,
although grossly, in the Sefer Yetzirah, and that the theory of ideas is
absolutely inseparable from the metaphysics of the Zohar.

We want to add here that an application of the Pythagorean principle is
found in the first of these two monuments which is literally reproduced
in the writings of Philo, and for which we shall look in vain in the
works of any other Greek writing philosopher. It is because of the
influence of the number seven that we possess seven principal
organs--the five senses, the organ of speech and the generative organs;
and it is for the same reason that there are seven gates of the soul, to
wit: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils and one mouth. <span
id="fr_600"></span>[97](#fn_600.md) We find also in the Septuagint another
Kabbalistic tradition which was later appropriated to Gnosticism. When
the text tells us that "the Most High marked the borders of the nations
according to the number of children of Israel," we read in the
Alexandrian translation that "the nations were divided according to the
number of the angels of

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

the Lord." <span id="fr_601"></span>[98](#fn_601.md) This, apparently odd
and arbitrary interpretation, <span id="fr_602"></span>[99](#fn_602.md)
becomes very intelligible when compared with a passage in the Zohar
where we are told that there are seventy nations on earth, <span
id="fr_603"></span>[100](#fn_603.md) that each of these nations is placed
under the power of an angel whom it recognizes as its God, and who, so
to speak, is the personification of its own spirit. The children of
Israel alone are privileged to have over them no one but the true God
Who had chosen them as His people. <span
id="fr_604"></span>[101](#fn_604.md) We find the same tradition with
another sacred writer who is just as old as the Septuagint
version. <span id="fr_605"></span>[102](#fn_605.md)

No doubt that the Greek philosophy which flourished in the capital of
the Ptolomeans exercised a great influence upon this famous translation;
but we find ideas there which have evidently been drawn from another
source, and which could not even have been brought forth upon Egyptian
soil. For were it otherwise, that is, if all the elements pointed out by
us, as the allegoric

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

interpretations of the religious elements, the personification of the
Word and its identity with the absolute place, were the result of the
general trend of thought of that period, in the land of which we spoke,
how is it that during a lapse of two centuries, from the time of the
last authors of the Septuagint version until Philo, not the least
mention of that trend is made in the history of Greek philosophy? <span
id="fr_606"></span>[103](#fn_606.md) But we have another, nearly
contemporaneous monument, wherein we find the same spirit in a more
definite form, and the Hebrew origin of which can not be contested. It
is the book of Jesus, son of Sirach, commonly called Ecclesiasticus.

This religious author is known to us at present only through a Greek
translation which came from the pen of his grandson. In a sort of
preface we are told by the latter that he came to Egypt (probably after
leaving Judea) in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Evergetes II.
If we take therefore the original writer to have lived fifty years
earlier, we find him two centuries before the Christian era. Without
placing implicit faith in the testimony of the translator, who assures
us that his grandfather drew only from Hebrew sources, we want to point
out that Jesus, the son of Sirach, is often eulogized by the Talmud
under the name of Joshuah ben Sirach ben Eliezer. <span
id="fr_607"></span>[104](#fn_607.md) The original text still existed at the
time of St. Jerome, and until the beginning of the fourth century Jews
as well as Gentiles counted it among their sacred writings. Now then, we
find in the writings of this ancient author not only the traditions of
which we just spoke, but also the doctrine of the Logos or of Divine
Wisdom nearly in the same form as it is taught by Philo and by the
Kabbalists.

Wisdom is, first of all, the same power as the Word, or the "Memra" of
the Chaldean translators. It is *the* Word; it went

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

forth from the mouth of the Most High (ἐγὼ ἀπὸ στόματος ὑψίστου
ἐξῆλθον); <span id="fr_608"></span>[105](#fn_608.md) it can not be taken as
a simple abstraction, as a purely logical being, for it manifests itself
in the midst of its people, in the assembly of the Most High, and
praises its soul (ἐν μέσῳ λαοῦ αὐτῆς καυχήσεται . . . αἰνέσει ψυχὴν
αὐτῆς). (Ch. XXIV, 1.) This heavenly assembly is probably composed of
forces subordinate to it; for the Talmud and Zohar make frequent use of
a very similar expression to convey the same thought. <span
id="fr_609"></span>[106](#fn_609.md) Wisdom, thus introduced upon the
scene, presents itself as the firstborn of God; for it existed already
at the very beginning, when time was not yet, and it will not cease to
exist in the course of ages. <span id="fr_610"></span>[107](#fn_610.md)
Wisdom has always been with God; (Ch. I, 1.) it is through Wisdom that
the world was created; Wisdom alone formed the celestial spheres and
descended to the depths of the abyss. Its empire extends over the waves
of the ocean, over all regions of the earth, and over all the peoples
and all the nations that inhabit it. (Ch. XXIV, 566.) Having been
ordered by God to look for a dwelling place here below, its choice fell
upon Zion. <span id="fr_611"></span>[108](#fn_611.md)

When we consider that, according to our author, every other nation is
subject to the influence of an angel or a subordinate power, we ought to
look upon the choice of Zion as the dwelling place for Wisdom as a
simple metaphor. On the contrary, that choice shows, as the quoted
tradition expressly says, that the spirit of God, or the Logos, acted
directly without an intermediary, upon the prophets of Israel. <span
id="fr_612"></span>[109](#fn_612.md) If Wisdom were not something
substantial, if it were not in some way the instrument and the servant
of God, how could it be conceived sitting upon a throne within a column
of clouds, the same column, probably, that marched before the Hebrew
people in the desert? <span id="fr_613"></span>[110](#fn_613.md) The spirit

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

of this book, as well as that of the Septuagint version and the Chaldaic
paraphrases of Onkelos, consists, on the whole, in placing between the
Sovereign Being (ὁ ὕψιστος) and this perishable world a mediating power
which is, at the same time, eternal and the first work of God; which
acts and speaks for Him, and which is itself His word and His creative
power. <span id="fr_614"></span>[111](#fn_614.md) The abyss between the
finite and the infinite is thus filled; heaven and earth are not
divorced any longer; God manifests Himself through His word, and His
word through the universe. But the Divine Word has no need of being
recognized first in the visible things; it sometimes comes directly to
man in the form of a holy inspiration, or through the gift of prophecy
and revelation.

It was thus that the nation was raised above all other nations, and a
man, the lawgiver of the Hebrews, above all other men. I want to add
here that there is no conflict in this, so important, result between
theology and criticism. For when we inquire into the most orthodox
translations, as that of Sacy, about the work that interests us at
present, we shill find many allusions to the doctrine of the Word. <span
id="fr_615"></span>[112](#fn_615.md) We may say the same of the "Book of
Wisdom," where the following passage has long since been found. <span
id="fr_616"></span>[113](#fn_616.md) "Wisdom is more active than the most
active thing . . . It is the breath, that is to say, an emanation of
God's power and a very pure effusion of the brightness of the Almighty.
It is the reflection of the everlasting light, the spotless mirror of
the majesty of God and the image of His goodness. Although only one, it
can accomplish everything, and resting immutably in itself, it renews
all things. It enters at different times into holy souls and makes them
prophets and friends of God." (Ch. VII, 24-27.)

But it seems to us that the general character of this work comes nearer
to the Platonic philosophy than to the mysticism of

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Philo. And as
neither the age nor the true origin of this work is known, <span
id="fr_617"></span>[114](#fn_617.md) we are compelled to wait until a
critic, more learned than ours, will have settled these questions. <span
id="fr_618"></span>[115](#fn_618.md) However, the facts we have collected
demonstrate fully that the Kabbalah is neither a child of the Greek
civilization of Alexandria, nor of pure Platonism. In fact, were we to
treat only of the principle which serves as basis to every Kabbalistic
system, namely, the personification of the Word and of the Divine Wisdom
considered as the immanent cause of the beings, we can find it at an
epoch when the particular Alexandrian spirit was still in the process of
being born. And where do we find it? In a traditional translation, so to
speak, of the Scriptures, and in another monument of a purely Hebrew
origin. When details and secondary ideas are considered, as for example
the different applications of the allegorical method, or the deductions
that may be drawn from the metaphysical principle of which we have
spoken, the great difference between the writings of Philo and those of
the Hebrew Kabbalists are easily seen.

him whether the name of God, Θεός, is or is not preceded by the definite
article ό, etc. See Gefroerer, loc. cit., vol. I, p. 50.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[261:78](rph20.htm#fr_581.md) How, for instance,
can the abstract substance be called the "No-Thing" (‏אין‎--Eye-in)
without the Hebrew text ‏והחכמה מאין תמצא‎ and wisdom where shall it be
found? (Job, 28, 12). What is to become of the names of the first three
Sefiroth? How could we possibly deduct the unity of God and of the world
from the translation of the three words ‏מי ברא אלה‎--who created these?

<span id="fn_602"></span>[266:99](rph20.htm#fr_602.md) I omit here Dr.
Jellinek's footnote wherein he puts the opinion of the author above that
of Dr. Frankel (Preliminary Studies to the Septuagint). We are not
concerned here with the criticism of Frankel's opinion. What is of
importance, though, is Frankel's remark that the words ‏בני אלהים‎ are
sometimes translated in the Septuagint by of οἵ ἄγγελοι τοῦ Θεοῦ (the
angels of God), and sometimes by υἱοὶ Θεοῦ (sons of God). To this Dr.
Jellinek makes the following remark: Noteworthy is the following saying
of Simeon ben Yohai: ‏ויראו בני אלהים ר׳ שמעון בר׳ יוחאי קרא להון בני
דיינא, ר׳ שמעון בן יוחאי הוי מקלל לכל מאן דקרי להון בנר אלהיי.‎ "R.
Simeon ben Yohai translated the words 'and the angels of Elohim saw'
(Genesis VI, 2) with 'the sons of the judges,' and he cursed those who
called them (Aramaic) ‏בני אלהייא‎. ‏אלהייא‎ in Aramaic has the only
meaning of "gods," while ‏אלהים‎ in Hebrew means also "judges." This
passage shows on the one hand how much R. Simeon ben Yohai was opposed
to the conception of "sons of God;" on the other hand, the υἱοὶ Θεοῦ
(sons of God) was known also among the Palestinian Jews.--Transl.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[266:100](rph20.htm#fr_603.md) The Talmud is also
acquainted with the tradition that there are seventy nations and seventy
languages. Compare Shekalim, fol. 13.--Jellinek

<span id="fn_618"></span>[270:115](rph20.htm#fr_618.md) We believe,
however, that the author was familiar with the Hebrew sources; for we
find with him [apocryphal](errata.htm#28.md) legends which are otherwise
met in the Midrashim of Palestine. Of such nature is the legend of the
manna which had the taste of any dish desired; <span
id="fr_619"></span>[\*](#fn_619.md) also the legend of Joseph, who, it was
believed, became king of Egypt, and that during the three days of
darkness the Egyptians were unable to keep up any artificial
light.--Wisdom, ch. XVI, 20-23. See dom Calmet's "Preface to the Book of
Wisdom."

<span id="fn_619"></span>[270:\*](rph20.htm#fr_619.md) This legend is also
found in the Babylonian Talmud. Tract. Yoma, fol. 75. ‏כל זמן שישראל
אוכלין אותו (את המן) מוצאין בו כמה טעמים‎ "As long as Israel ate the
manna, they found in it any taste desired."--Jellinek
