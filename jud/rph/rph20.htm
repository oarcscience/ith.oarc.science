<p>Without repeating what has been said before of the relative isolation of the Jews of Palestine and those of Egypt, we may add that Philo's name is never mentioned by the Jewish writers of the Middle Ages. Neither Saadia&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> nor Maimonides,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> neither their later disciples nor the modern Kabbalists, have dedicated any monument to him, and even now he is barely known among those of his coreligionists who are strangers to the Greek literature.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_505"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> We shall not linger, though, upon these external facts, the importance of which we do not wish to exaggerate. As we have hinted before, we shall look for the solution of our problem in our philosopher's own opinions, which have been made clear by the labors of modern criticism.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

<p>There is nothing in the writings of Philo that can possibly be called a system. Incongruous opinions in disorderly juxtaposition--I refer to the symbolic interpretation of the Holy Scriptures--serve a most arbitrary method. All the elements of this chaos which are held together by one common bond--the innate desire of the author to demonstrate in the Hebrew writings the presence of the highest and purest in the wisdom of other nations--may be divided into two big classes. The elements of one class have been borrowed from the philosophic systems of Greece, systems which are not irreconcilable with the fundamental principles of any moral or religious teaching, like that of Pythagoras, Aristotle and Zeno;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> but above all that of Plato, whose language and ideas make up the first sketch, so to speak, in all the writings of the Hebrew philosopher. The elements of the other class visibly betray, by the contempt they instill for reason and science, by the impatience with which they precipitate in some manner the human soul into the bosom of the infinite, their foreign origin, and can come only from the Orient. This dualism of the Philonic ideas is of the greatest importance, not only for the problem we are to solve, but for the history of philosophy in general; and we shall first of all endeavor to determine it definitely, at least, on the points most salient and most worthy of our interest.</p>  
<p>When speaking of the creation and of the first principles of beings, of God and of His relations to the universe, Philo has evidently two doctrines in mind, doctrines that can never be brought in accord by any effort of logic. One doctrine is simply the dualism of Plato as taught in Timaeus; the other reminds us at once of Plotinus and the Kabbalah. We shall take up the first doctrine which, singularly, is placed in the mouth of Moses: "The legislator of the Hebrews," says our author in his Treatise</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_241"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 241</FONT></A></p>  
<p>on the Creation,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_509"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> "recognized two equally necessary principles, one active and the other passive. The first is the highest and absolute Intelligence which is above virtue, above knowledge, above the good and the beautiful itself; the second is the inert and inanimate matter which became perfect by receiving motion, form and life from Intelligence."</p>  
<p>To avoid taking the last principle as a pure abstraction, Philo takes care to repeat in another work&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> the famous maxim of Pagan antiquity, that there is neither absolute beginning nor absolute annihilation, but that the same elements pass from one form to another. These elements are earth, water, air and fire. We are taught that, in order to make the world a work fully accomplished and worthy of the supreme architect, God left no particle outside of the world.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> But before giving form to matter and existence to this sensual universe, God visualized in His thought the intelligible universe or the prototypes, the incorruptible ideas of things.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> Divine kindness, which is the only cause of the formation of the world,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_513"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> explains also why the world should not perish. God can not, without discontinuing His goodness, wish to replace order and general harmony by chaos; and to imagine a better world which is some day to replace ours, is to accuse God of having failed in His goodness towards</p>

<p>the present order of things.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_514"></A><A HREF="#fn_514"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> According to this system the generation of beings, or the application of the power which formed the universe, must have necessarily commenced, but it can not continue to act endlessly; for God can not destroy the already formed world by producing another; matter can not return to general chaos. Moreover, God is not the immanent cause of the beings, neither is He the creative cause in the modern theological sense. He is only the Supreme Architect, the Demiurge, and this is really the term Philo makes use of when he is under the influence of the Greek philosophy.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_515"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> Finally, God is not only above, but completely apart from the creation (&#8001; &#7952;&#0960;&#0953;&#0946;&#0949;&#0946;&#0951;&#0954;&#8060;&#0962; &#0964;&#8183; &#0954;&#0972;&#0963;&#0956;&#8179; &#0954;&#0945;&#8054; &#7956;&#0958;&#0969; &#0964;&#0959;&#8166; &#0948;&#0951;&#0956;&#0953;&#0959;&#0965;&#0961;&#0947;&#0951;&#0952;&#0941;&#0957;&#0964;&#0959;&#0962; &#8036;&#0957;) (De Posteritate Caini); for, possessing infinite knowledge and felicity, He can have no relation to a formless and unclean substance as matter is.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_516"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Let us now try to harmonize these principles with the following doctrines: God never rests in His works, but it is His nature always to produce, just as it is the nature of fire to burn, and that of snow to diffuse cold.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> Rest, as applied to God, does not mean inactivity; for the active cause of the universe can never cease to produce the most beautiful works. But we say that God rests, because His endless activity works spontaneously (&#0956;&#0949;&#0964;&#8048; &#0960;&#0959;&#0955;&#0955;&#8134;&#0962; &#0949;&#8016;&#0956;&#0945;&#0961;&#0949;&#0943;&#0945;&#0962;), without pain and without fatigue.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_518"></A><A HREF="#fn_518"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> It is also absurd to take literally the words of the Scriptures which tell us that the world was created in six days. Far from lasting but six days, creation did not even commence in <i>time</i>.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> For, according to Plato, time itself was created with other things, and is but a fleeting image of eternity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_519"></A><A HREF="#fn_519"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> Divine action, as was said before, does not only give form to inert matter, and causes the departure of all the elements necessary for the formation of the world from disorder and darkness, but it becomes really creative and absolute; it is limited neither in space nor in time.</p>  
<p>"In giving rise to things," says Philo expressly, "God did not only make them visible, but He produced what did not exist before. He is not only the architect (the Demiurge) of the universe, He is also its creator."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_520"></A><A HREF="#fn_520"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> He is the principle of all action in each particular being, as well as in the totality of things, for to Him alone belongs activity; passivity is in the nature of all things engendered.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_521"></A><A HREF="#fn_521"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> It is probably because of this that everything is filled with and penetrated by His presence; and it is also because of this that He does not permit anything to stay void of and abandoned by Him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_522"></A><A HREF="#fn_522"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A> But as there is nothing that can embrace the Infinite, He is, therefore, nowhere and everywhere at the same time, an antithesis which we heard already from the mouth of Porphyrius, and which was understood in the same sense as it was later understood by the disciples of Plotinus. God is nowhere because, place and space were created with the bodies, and we can not therefore say that the creator is confined in the creature. He is everywhere because He penetrates <A HREF="errata.htm#22">simultaneously</A>, by His various potencies (&#0964;&#8048;&#0962; &#0948;&#0965;&#0957;&#0940;&#0956;&#0949;&#0953;&#0962; &#0945;&#8016;&#0964;&#0959;&#8166;), earth and water,</p>

<p>air and heaven.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_523"></A><A HREF="#fn_523"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> He fills the least particle of the universe, uniting each other by invisible bonds.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_524"></A><A HREF="#fn_524"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>  
<p>But this is not enough. God Himself is the place of the universe (&#8001; &#0964;&#8182;&#0957; &#8005;&#0955;&#0969;&#0957; &#0964;&#0972;&#0960;&#0959;&#0962;) for He embraces all things, He is the shelter of the universe and His own seat, the place wherein He confines Himself and where He contains Himself.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_525"></A><A HREF="#fn_525"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A> When Malebranche (French philos. 1638-1715.--Trans.), who saw in God the place of spirits only, appears to us so close to Spinoza, what are we to think of one who represents the Supreme Being as the place of all the existences, of the spirits as well as of the bodies? But we must also ask what becomes of this idea of the passive principle of the universe? How are we to conceive as a real and necessary being that matter which has neither form nor activity in itself, which must have existed, and which, together with space, was transported into the bosom of God? And Philo is really driven by an irresistible inclination to pronounce the great words: <i>God is All</i> (&#0949;&#7991;&#0962; &#0954;&#0945;&#8054; &#0964;&#8056; &#0960;&#8118;&#0957; &#7936;&#0965;&#0964;&#0959;&#0962; &#7952;&#0963;&#0964;&#0953;&#0957;). (Legis. Alleg., I, 1.)</p>  
<p>But how did the Supreme Being cause to spring forth from this intelligible place, which is His own substance, an actual space containing this material and sensual world? How did He, Who is all activity and all intelligence, produce passive and inactive beings? The mementos of Greek philosophy are here entirely stifled by the language and the ideas of the Orient. God is the purest light, the prototype and source of all light. He sheds around Him innumerable rays of light, all intelligibles, which no</p>

<p>creature can behold;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_526"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> but His image is reflected in His thought (in His logos), and it is by this image alone that we can comprehend Him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_527"></A><A HREF="#fn_527"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A> Here we see already a first manifestation, or, as is generally said, a first emanation of divine nature. For, when the Platonic reminiscence of Philo make way to. other influences, the divine word becomes with him a real being, a person or a hypostasis, as it was later said in the Alexandrian school. Of such nature is the archangel who commands all celestial armies.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_528"></A><A HREF="#fn_528"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A></p>  
<p>But our philosopher does not stop at this point. From this first logos, ordinarily called "the most ancient" (&#8001; &#0960;&#0961;&#0949;&#0963;&#0946;&#8059;&#0964;&#0945;&#0964;&#0959;&#0962;), the <A HREF="errata.htm#23">firstborn</A> of God, which represents in the absolute sphere the "Thought" (&#0955;&#0972;&#0947;&#0959;&#0962; &#7952;&#0957;&#0948;&#0953;&#0940;&#0952;&#0949;&#0964;&#0959;&#0962;), there emanates another which represents the "Word" (&#0955;&#0972;&#0947;&#0959;&#0962; &#0960;&#0961;&#0959;&#0966;&#0959;&#0961;&#0953;&#0954;&#0972;&#0962;), that is to say, the creative power, the manifestation of which is the world. When we read in Genesis that a river went forth from Eden to water the garden, it means that the generic goodness is an emanation of the Divine Wisdom which is the Word of God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_529"></A><A HREF="#fn_529"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A> The author of this universe should be called both the architect as well as the father of His work. Supreme Wisdom we shall call the mother. It is with Supreme Wisdom that God united in a mysterious manner to make the generation of things operative. Impregnated with the divine germ, Supreme Wisdom gave birth, in pain and at the appointed time, the only well-beloved son whom we call the world. It is for this reason that a sacred writer presents to us Wisdom as speaking of itself in the following manner: "Of all the works of God I was the first to be formed; time was not yet when I already existed. For everything that is</p>

<p>engendered must naturally be younger than the mother and the nurse of the universe."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_530"></A><A HREF="#fn_530"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A></p>  
<p>There is a passage in Timaeus where we meet with nearly the same language, but with the vast difference that the mother and nurse of all things is a principle entirely apart from God; it is the inert and formless matter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_531"></A><A HREF="#fn_531"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A> The quoted passages remind us more of the ideas and the usual expressions of the Zohar. There, too, God is called the eternal light; there, too, the generation of things is metaphorically explained by the gradual darkening of the rays emanating from the divine center, and by the union of God with Himself in His diverse attributes. Springing from the bosom of God to give life to the universe, Supreme Wisdom is also represented by the river which went forth from the earthly paradise. The two logi, finally, remind us of the Kabbalistic principle that the world is nothing but the word of God; that His word or His voice is His thought become visible, and that His thought, finally, is Himself. Another picture, often drawn in the principal work of the Kabbalah, shows us the universe as a cloak or garment of God. Now then, we have here the same in the following words of Philo: "The Supreme Being is surrounded by a dazzling light which envelops Him like a rich cloak, and the most ancient word covers itself with the world as with a garment."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_532"></A><A HREF="#fn_532"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A></p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> He is considered for Himself, in His proper essence and independent of the creation. Sometime He is the supreme reason of things, the active and efficient cause of the universe (&#8001; &#0957;&#0959;&#8166;&#0962;, &#0964;&#8056; &#0948;&#0961;&#0945;&#0963;&#0964;&#8053;&#0961;&#0953;&#0959;&#0957; &#0945;&#7988;&#0964;&#0953;&#0959;&#0957;), the most general idea (&#0964;&#8056; &#0947;&#0949;&#0957;&#0953;&#0954;&#8061;&#0964;&#0945;&#0964;&#0959;&#0957;), (Legis. Alleg., II) the intelligible nature (&#0957;&#0959;&#0951;&#0964;&#8052; &#0966;&#8059;&#0963;&#0953;&#0962;). To Him alone belongs liberty, knowledge, joy, peace and happiness, in short--perfection.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_533"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A> Sometime He is represented higher even than perfection and all possible attributes. Nothing can give us an idea of Him; neither virtue nor knowledge, neither beauty nor goodness,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_534"></A><A HREF="#fn_534"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A> not even unity. For what we call unity is but an image of the first cause (&#0956;&#0959;&#0957;&#8048;&#0962; &#0956;&#8050;&#0957; &#7952;&#0963;&#0964;&#0953;&#0957; &#0949;&#7984;&#0954;&#8060;&#0957; &#0945;&#7984;&#0964;&#0943;&#0959;&#0965; &#0960;&#0961;&#8061;&#0964;&#0959;&#0965;),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_535"></A><A HREF="#fn_535"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A>, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_536"></A><A HREF="#fn_536"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A> All we know of Him is that He exists; to us He is the ineffable and nameless being.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_537"></A><A HREF="#fn_537"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A></p>  
<p>We easily recognize in the first case the influence of Plato, of the metaphysics of Aristotle, and even of the physiology of the stoics; in the second case there is an entirely different order of ideas. Here, the Neoplatonic unity and the Ayn Sof of the Kabbalah, the "Mystery of Mysteries," the "Unknown of the Unknown" which dominates both, the Sefiroth and the world, are clearly visible. This applies also necessarily to all that Philo, because of his religious belief or because of his philosophic views, presents to us as an intermediary between the things created and the purest essence of God; we refer to the angels, the Word, and in general to what Philo designates under the somewhat vague name of "Divine Powers (&#0948;&#0965;&#0957;&#0940;&#0956;&#0949;&#0953;&#0962; &#0964;&#0959;&#8166; &#0920;&#0949;&#0959;&#8166;)."

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Greek dualism is taken seriously, when the intelligent principle acts directly upon matter, and God is conceived as the Demiurge of the world, then the Word or the Logos is the divine idea, the seat of all ideas after which all things have been patterned. The forces and the messengers of God, that is, the angels of every degree of the celestial hierarchy, are the ideas themselves.</p>  
<p>This viewpoint is expressed already in the following short fragments: "If we are to speak prosaically, then the intelligible world is nothing but the thought of God while He prepared Himself to create the world, just as an architect who has the ideal city in his mind before constructing the real city according to this plan. Now, just as this ideal city occupies no space, and is but a picture in the mind of the architect, so can the intelligible world be nowhere but in the divine thought where the plan for the material universe was conceived. There is no other place capable of receiving and embracing even a single one of these unadulterated forces, much less all the forces of the supreme intelligence."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_538"></A><A HREF="#fn_538"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A> "These are the forces which have formed the immaterial and intelligible world, the prototype of the visible and the corporeal world."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_539"></A><A HREF="#fn_539"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A> In another place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_540"></A><A HREF="#fn_540"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A> we are told that the divine forces and the ideas are one and the same; that their task is to give the appropriate form to each object. In the same manner, nearly, the angels are referred to. They represent different particular forms of the everlasting reason or of virtue, and inhabit the divine space, that is to say, the intelligible world.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_541"></A><A HREF="#fn_541"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A></p>

<p>The power upon which they depend directly, or the archangel, is, as we already know, the logos itself. But this nature of things and these roles are entirely changed when, according to the conception of the author, God appears as the immanent cause and the true place of all beings. In this case we are not dealing any longer with the simple imprint of different forms upon matter that does not exist of its own essence; but, without losing anything of their intelligible value, all ideas become, in addition, substantial realities, active forces subordinated one to another, and yet bound in one substance, in one force, in one single intelligence.</p>  
<p>Wisdom or the Word thus becomes the first of all the heavenly forces, a distinct power, but not separated from the absolute being,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_542"></A><A HREF="#fn_542"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A> the spring that waters and vivifies the earth, the cup-bearer of the Most High who pours out the nectar of the souls, and Who is itself this nectar;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_543"></A><A HREF="#fn_543"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A> the firstborn of God and the mother of all the beings (&#0965;&#7985;&#8056;&#0962; &#0960;&#0961;&#0969;&#0964;&#0972;&#0947;&#0959;&#0957;&#0959;&#0962;),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_544"></A><A HREF="#fn_544"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A> It is also called the divine man (&#7940;&#0957;&#0952;&#0961;&#0969;&#0960;&#0959;&#0962; &#0920;&#0949;&#0959;&#8166;), for the image in which the earthly man was created on the sixth day, and which the Holy Scriptures call the image of God, is nothing but the everlasting Word.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_545"></A><A HREF="#fn_545"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A> It is the high priest of the universe (&#7936;&#0961;&#0967;&#0953;&#0949;&#0961;&#0949;&#8058;&#0962; &#0964;&#0959;&#8166; &#0967;&#0972;&#0963;&#0956;&#0959;&#0965;), that is to say, the conciliator between the finite and the infinite.

It is the Word that the patriarch Jacob saw in a dream, and it is the Word again that spoke to Moses in the burning bush. (Ib. supra.)</p>  
<p>We have already seen how this Supreme Word engenders another which springs from its bosom by way of emanation, like a river gushing from its source. This second word is the goodness, the creative virtue (&#0948;&#8059;&#0957;&#0945;&#0956;&#0953;&#0962; &#0960;&#0959;&#0953;&#0951;&#0964;&#0953;&#0954;&#8052;), a hypostatized Platonic idea. Below the goodness is the royal power (&#7969; &#0946;&#0945;&#0963;&#0953;&#0955;&#0953;&#0954;&#8052;) which governs with justice all created beings.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_548"></A><A HREF="#fn_548"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A> These three forces, the two last ones of which, when confined in their action to man only, are called "Mercy" and "Judgment" (&#7969; &#7989;&#0955;&#0949;&#0969;&#0962; &#0954;&#0945;&#8054; &#7969; &#0957;&#0959;&#0956;&#0959;&#0952;&#0949;&#0964;&#0953;&#0954;&#8053;), revealed themselves once upon the earth under the disguise of the three angels who visited Abraham.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_549"></A><A HREF="#fn_549"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A> They make up the invisible good and the harmony of this world, just as they are, on the other hand, the glory, the presence of God, whence they descend by a gradual darkening of the infinite splendor; for each one of them is both shadow and light; shadow of that which is above, light and life of all that is below their own sphere.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_550"></A><A HREF="#fn_550"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Their essence, finally, is just as impossible to comprehend as that of the primitive being, although their action is present everywhere and their forms manifest themselves in the forms of the universe. It is just what God Himself had taught Moses when the latter implored Him, says Philo, to show him at least, His glory (&#0964;&#8052;&#0957; &#0916;&#0972;&#0958;&#0945;&#0957; &#0945;&#8016;&#0964;&#0959;&#8166;), that is to say, the forces that surround His inaccessible throne (&#0948;&#0959;&#0961;&#0965;&#0966;&#0959;&#0961;&#0959;&#8059;&#0963;&#0945;&#0962; &#0948;&#0965;&#0957;&#0940;&#0956;&#0949;&#0953;&#0962;), after asking</p>

Proof of it is the following passage which we shall translate: "The beings designated by the philosophers of other nations as demons, are called by Moses angels. These are the souls that float in the air, and no one must deny their existence; for the universe must be animated in all its parts, and each element must be inhabited by living beings. The earth is thus stocked with animals, the sea and rivers with the inhabitants of water, the fire with the salamander--supposed to be quite common in Macedonia--the heavens by the stars. In fact, if the stars were not pure and divine souls, they would not be endowed with circular motion which properly belongs to the spirit only. It follows, therefore, that the air must also be peopled by living beings, although our eyes can not see them."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_553"></A><A HREF="#fn_553"><FONT SIZE="1">50</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Philo's syncretism shows itself most plainly, and the twofold direction to which he commits himself, notwithstanding his lively predilection for Oriental ideas, is most easily seen, when he comes to speak of man. Thus, unlike Plato, he is not content with seeing the pale imprint of the eternal ideas in material things; but he even maintains that without the help of the senses we can never rise to higher cognition, that without the spectacle of the material world we can not even suspect the existence of an immaterial and invisible world.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_554"></A><A HREF="#fn_554"><FONT SIZE="1">51</FONT></A> He then declares the influence</p>

<p>of the senses to be absolutely harmful, and commands man to sever all connections with them and to take refuge within himself. He creates an abyss between the rational, intelligent soul, which alone is privileged to constitute man, and the sentient soul from which our organs borrow life as well as the knowledge appropriate to them. This soul resides, as Moses said, in the blood,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">52</FONT></A> while the other is an emanation, an inseparable reflection of divine nature (&#7936;&#0960;&#0972;&#0963;&#0960;&#0945;&#0963;&#0956;&#0945; &#0959;&#8016; &#0948;&#0953;&#0945;&#0953;&#0961;&#0949;&#0964;&#0972;&#0957;, &#7936;&#0960;&#0945;&#8059;&#0947;&#0945;&#0963;&#0956;&#0945; &#0920;&#0949;&#0943;&#0945;&#0962; &#0966;&#8059;&#0963;&#0949;&#0969;&#0962;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_556"></A><A HREF="#fn_556"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A></p>  
<p>This exaggerated viewpoint does not prevent him from retaining the Platonic opinion which recognizes in the human soul three elements: the thought, the will and the passions.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_557"></A><A HREF="#fn_557"><FONT SIZE="1">54</FONT></A> In innumerable places he insists upon the necessity of preparing for wisdom by what he calls "encyclical sciences" (&#7952;&#0947;&#0954;&#8059;&#0954;&#0955;&#0953;&#0959;&#0962; &#0960;&#0945;&#0953;&#0948;&#0949;&#0943;&#0945;, &#7952;&#0947;&#0954;&#8059;&#0954;&#0955;&#0953;&#0945; &#0956;&#0945;&#0952;&#8053;&#0956;&#0945;&#0964;&#0945;), that is to say, by oratory and those sciences which produce that outward culture so dear to the Greeks. Our mind, he says, must be fed with this mundane knowledge before it can aspire to higher science, just as our body must be fed with milk before it can bear more substantial food.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_558"></A><A HREF="#fn_558"><FONT SIZE="1">55</FONT></A> Any one neglecting to acquire these must succumb in this world as Abel succumbed to the blows of his fratricidal brother.</p>  
<p>In another place he teaches entirely to the contrary: The word and the outward appearance is to be scorned, just as the body and the senses are to be scorned, that we may live in the intelligence and in the contemplation of the naked truth only. God's command to Abraham to leave his country, his family and the house of his father, means that man must break away from his body, his senses and the word. For the body is but part of the earth where we are forced to live; the senses are the servants</p>

<p>and the brothers of the thought; and the word, finally, is but the cover and, in some measure, the dwelling place of the intelligence which is our real father. (De Somniis, L, 1.)</p>  
<p>The same thought is symbolically reproduced in a more expressive manner by Hagar and Ishmael. This, rebellious servant and her son, who were so ignominiously driven from the house of their master, represent the encyclical knowledge and the sophism it begets. It is hardly necessary to add that any one aspiring to a higher level of the spiritual world must imitate the Hebrew patriarch.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_559"></A><A HREF="#fn_559"><FONT SIZE="1">56</FONT></A> But does the soul, when fully retired in the intelligence, find there, at least, self-satisfaction and the means of arriving through its own efforts to truth and wisdom? Had Philo answered this question in the affirmative, he would no have gone beyond the doctrine of Plato. For in Plato's estimation only he is truly wise who entirely renounces body and senses, and labors hard all his life to learn how to die. (Phedon, ad init.) But our Alexandrian philosopher oversteps this boundary; for, besides the knowledge borrowed from reason, besides the enlightenment given by philosophy, he is also in need of enlightenment and of higher knowledge, emanating directly from God, and given to intelligence as a favor, a mysterious gift.</p>  
<p>When we read in the Scriptures, he says, that God spoke to man, we are not to believe that a material voice verberated the air, but that the human soul had been illumined by the purest light. In this manner only can the divine word address itself to man. Again, when the Law was promulgated on the Mount Sinai, it is not said that a voice was heard, but, according to the text, a voice was seen by all the people assembled. "You have seen," says Jehovah, "that I spoke to you from heaven above."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_560"></A><A HREF="#fn_560"><FONT SIZE="1">57</FONT></A> Since a miracle is explained it can not refer here to rational knowledge or to a mere contemplation of ideas but to a revelation</p>

<p><A NAME="page_254"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 254</FONT></A></p>  
<p>mystically understood. We shall give the same meaning to another passage where the possibility of grasping God Himself through direct manifestation (&#7936;&#0960;&#8125; &#0945;&#8016;&#0964;&#0959;&#8166; &#0945;&#8016;&#0964;&#8056;&#0957; &#0954;&#0945;&#0964;&#0945;&#0955;&#0945;&#0956;&#0946;&#0940;&#0957;&#0949;&#0953;&#0957;) is admitted, instead of rising to Him by the contemplation of His works. In this state, adds our author, we understand at a glance the essence of God, His word and the universe.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_561"></A><A HREF="#fn_561"><FONT SIZE="1">58</FONT></A> He recognizes Faith (&#0960;&#0943;&#0963;&#0964;&#0953;&#0962;), which he calls "the queen of virtues" (&#7969; &#0964;&#8182;&#0957; &#7936;&#0961;&#0949;&#0964;&#8182;&#0957; &#0946;&#0945;&#0963;&#0953;&#0955;&#0943;&#0962;), as the most perfect of all goodness, the cement that unites us with divine nature.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_562"></A><A HREF="#fn_562"><FONT SIZE="1">59</FONT></A> It is Faith that is represented in the story of Judah and Tamar; for as he united himself with her without lifting the veil that covered her face, so does Faith unite us with God.</p>  
<p>Philo shows the same hesitation when speaking of human liberty as when explaining the nature and origin of our knowledge. At times the Stoic doctrine that man is free triumphs; the laws of necessity which govern without exception all other creatures, do not exist for man. This free choice, then, which is his privilege, imposes upon him at the same time the responsibility for his actions; only thus is man alone among all other beings capable of virtue, and hereby alone are we justified in saying that God, in His desire to manifest Himself in the universe through the idea of goodness, found no more dignified a temple than the human soul.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_563"></A><A HREF="#fn_563"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A> But it is easily seen that this theory, so true and wise, contradicts certain general principles previously expounded; as the unity of substance, the formation of beings by way of emanation, and even the Platonic dualism.</p>  
<p>Our philosopher has also no scruples in deserting this theory for opposite views, and it is readily noted that he finds himself there more at ease, and that he unfolds there much better the</p>  
<p>
</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_255"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 255</FONT></A></p>  
<p>wealth of his half-oriental style and the resources of his natural genius. He takes there from man his free choice as well as his moral responsibility. The evil we attribute to ourselves as the one generally reigning in this world, is the inevitable fruit of matter,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_564"></A><A HREF="#fn_564"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A> or the work of inferior forces which took part with the divine logos in the formation of man. The good, on the contrary, belongs to God alone. It is really because it does not suit the Supreme Being to participate in evil, that He called for subordinate workers to co-operate with Him in the creation of Adam, but all the good in our actions and in our thoughts must be attributed to Him alone.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_565"></A><A HREF="#fn_565"><FONT SIZE="1">62</FONT></A></p>  
<p>According to this principle it is boastful and impious to consider oneself the author of any work; it means to compare oneself with God Who alone deposited in our soul the germ of good, and Who alone is qualified to impregnate it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_566"></A><A HREF="#fn_566"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A> This quality, without which we would be swallowed up by evil and blended with nothingness or matter, is called by Philo by its true name, it is the "Grace (&#7969; &#0967;&#0940;&#0961;&#0953;&#0962;)." "Grace," he says, "is the heavenly virgin who serves as mediatress between God and the soul; between God who holds forth, and the soul which receives. The entire written law is but a symbol of Grace."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_567"></A><A HREF="#fn_567"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Along with this quite mysterious influence, Philo admits another influence which endangers no less the moral responsibility, and consequently, the free choice. It is the reversibility of good. The righteous is the expiatory victim of the wicked, and it is for the sake of the righteous that God lavishes upon the</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>wicked His inexhaustible treasures.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_568"></A><A HREF="#fn_568"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A> This dogma, equally adopted by the Kabbalists and applied by them to the entire universe, is fundamentally a development of Grace. Grace alone brings about the merit of the righteous; why, then, can it not also come by the same channel to the wicked? As to that other obstacle to human liberty--the original sin--it would not be impossible to find its definition in some isolated words of our author.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_569"></A><A HREF="#fn_569"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A> But in such an important subject we must expect more explicit and more definite proofs. We can positively state that Philo considered life itself as a state of forfeiture and of compulsion; consequently, the more man enters life, or the further he penetrates through will or through intelligence the realm of nature, the more he must have believed that man wanders from God, that he becomes perverted and degraded. This principle is almost the only foundation of Philo's morality, which we shall survey rapidly.</p>  
<p>While we meet here with some contradictions now and then, yet the Greek influence extends to the language only; the back-ground is entirely oriental and mystic. For example, when Philo tells us, as Antisthenes and Zeno do, that we must live according to nature (&#0950;&#8134;&#0957; &#8001;&#0956;&#0959;&#0955;&#0959;&#0947;&#0959;&#0965;&#0956;&#0941;&#0957;&#0969;&#0962; &#0964;&#8135; &#0966;&#8059;&#0963;&#0949;&#0953;), he understands by human nature not only the entire domination of spirit over body, of reason over senses, but also the observation of all the revealed laws, undoubtedly, as interpreted and understood by him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_570"></A><A HREF="#fn_570"><FONT SIZE="1">67</FONT></A> When he admits, like Plato and the Stoic school, what was later called the "four cardinal virtues," he represents them, at the same time, as inferior and purely human virtues; above these he shows us, as their common source, the goodness or love, a purely religious virtue which concerns itself with God alone, Whose</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_257"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 257</FONT></A></p>  
<p>image and purest emanation it is. It springs directly from the Eden, that is to say, from Divine Wisdom, where alone joy, pleasure and delight in God is found.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_571"></A><A HREF="#fn_571"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A> It is probably in this sense, and following the example of Socrates, that he identifies virtue with wisdom.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_572"></A><A HREF="#fn_572"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A></p>  
<p>We must, finally, take care not to attribute to him Aristotle's thoughts when, following the expressions of that philosopher, he says that virtue may come from three sources--from knowledge, nature and exercise.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_573"></A><A HREF="#fn_573"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A> True science and wisdom, according to Philo, is not the one which results from a natural development of our intelligence, but the one given to us by the grace of God. According to the Greek philosopher it is nature itself that drives us towards the good; according to Philo, there are in man two entirely contrary natures which combat each other, and one of which must necessarily succumb; thenceforth both are in a state of violence and restraint which does not permit them to remain at rest. Whence his third expedient to attain moral perfection: asceticism in its highest degree as a substitute for the legitimate control of the will and reason over our desires. In fact, it is not only the question here of lessening evil and of confining it to more or less restricted limits, but it must be pursued as long as the least trace of it is visible; it must be destroyed, if possible, root and branch. For the evil we suffer from in this world is entirely in our passions which Philo considers absolutely foreign to the nature of the soul.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_574"></A><A HREF="#fn_574"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A> The passions, to use his language, have their origin in the flesh. The flesh, therefore, must be humiliated and mortified; it must be combatted under all forms</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_258"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 258</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and in all instances;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_575"></A><A HREF="#fn_575"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A> we must lift ourselves from this state of forfeiture which is called life; we must regain liberty in the very bosom of that prison which we call body by absolute indifference to all perishable possessions.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_576"></A><A HREF="#fn_576"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A></p>  
<p>As this state of misery is the purpose and result of marriage, the latter is considered by Philo, without being openly condemned, as a humiliating necessity from which the select souls, at least, ought to liberate themselves.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_577"></A><A HREF="#fn_577"><FONT SIZE="1">74</FONT></A> These, approximately, are the principal characteristics of the ascetic life, more so conceived and shown to us by Philo, than he has seen it realized by the sect of the Therapeutics. But the ascetic life is only a means; its aim, that is to say, the aim of morality itself, the highest degree of perfection, of happiness and of existence, is the union of the soul with God through total forgetfulness of itself, through enthusiasm and through love.</p>  
<p>Here are some passages which we may believe to have been borrowed from some mystic of modern times: "O, my soul! If you desire to inherit heavenly gifts, it is not only necessary, as our first patriarch did, to leave the land you inhabit, that is to say, your body; the family you were born in, that is to say, the senses; and the house of your father, or the word; you must also avoid yourself that you may be outside of you, like those corybants who are intoxicated with divine enthusiasm. For the inheritance of heavenly blessing is only there where the soul, full of enthusiasm, does not live any more in itself, but plunges with delight into divine love and, attracted, ascends towards its father. (Quis rerum Divinarum haeres sit.) Once delivered from all passion, the soul pours itself out like a pure libation before the Lord. For to pour one's soul before God, to break the chains we find in the vain cares of this perishable life, means to step out</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_259"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 259</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of one's self to reach the limits of the universe, and to enjoy the heavenly sight of Him Who always was." (De Ebrietate.) The contemplative life--although it may not be the only one for man to choose--is placed by such principles far above all social virtues whose principle is love and whose aim is the well-being of man.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_578"></A><A HREF="#fn_578"><FONT SIZE="1">75</FONT></A> Even the cult-.--I mean the outward cult--can not bring us to the aim we are to look for.</p>  
<p>Philo is really very <A HREF="errata.htm#25">embarrassed</A> on this point. "Just as we must," he says, "take care of the body, since it is the dwelling place of the soul, just so must we observe the written laws; for the truer we will be to them, the better will we understand things they symbolize. In addition to this we must avoid the blame and the accusations of the masses."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_579"></A><A HREF="#fn_579"><FONT SIZE="1">76</FONT></A> This last reason resembles very much the postscript of some letters. This alone expresses the thought of our philosopher and establishes a closer relation between him and the Kabbalists. It also justifies the opinion the Talmudists had of their brethren who were initiated in Greek learning.</p>  
<p>Of what has been said until now we obtain two extremely important deductions with reference to the origin of the Kabbalah. The first deduction is that this traditional doctrine was not taken from the writings of Philo. Indeed, since all Greek systems--and we may even say the entire Greek <A HREF="errata.htm#26">civilization</A>--have left so many traces, intimately blended with elements of another nature, in the writings of Philo, why do we not find the same condition in the oldest writings of the Kabbalistic science? We say it again, that we can never find, either in the Zohar or in the Book of Formation, the least trace of that splendid civilization which has been transplanted by the Ptolemies to Egyptian soil. Without mentioning the previously indicated external difficulties which we</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_260"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 260</FONT></A></p>  
<p>uphold here in their full force, is it possible that Simeon ben Yohai and his friends, or whoever the authors of the Zohar may have been, could differentiate in Philo's writings, if these were their only guide, between that which has been borrowed from the different Greek philosophers, whose names are seldom mentioned by their Alexandrian disciples, and that which belongs to another doctrine which is based upon the idea of one and immanent principle which is the substance and form of all beings? Such a supposition is unworthy of discussion.</p>  
<p>Besides, what we designated as the oriental part of Philo's syncretism is far from corresponding in all important points with the mysticism taught by the Palestinian sages. Thus, according to Philo, there are only five divine forces or attributes, while the Kabbalists admit ten Sefiroth. Although enthusiastically expounding the doctrine, Philo nevertheless preserves always a certain dualism, the (absolute) Being and the forces, or the substance and the attributes which, according to him, are separated by an impassable abyss. The Kabbalists look upon the Sefiroth as diverse boundaries within which the absolute principle of things circumscribes itself, or as "vessels," to use their own mode of expression. The divine substance, they add, need only withdraw, and these vessels would break and waste. Let us also remember that they expressly taught the identity of existence with thought. Philo, who is unconsciously dominated by the idea (of Plato and Anaxogoras) that matter is a principle distinct from God and everlasting as He, is naturally led to consider life a forfeiture and the body a prison.</p>  
<p>This also accounts for his contempt of marriage, which he regards merely as a gratification of the flesh. The Kabbalists, on the other hand, although agreeing with the Scriptures that in the first days of the creation, when he was not ruled by sensual passions, man was happier than now, still look upon life in general as a necessary trial, as a means through which finite beings like we may elevate themselves to God, and unite with Him in</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_261"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 261</FONT></A></p>  
<p>boundless love. Marriage to them is not only the symbol, but the beginning, the first condition of this mysterious union; they carry marriage into the soul and into heaven. It is the fusion of two human souls by mutual completion. The interpretative system, finally, which Philo applies to the Holy Scriptures, although basically identical with that of the Kabbalists, could not, however, have served as a pattern to the latter.</p>  
<p>Philo was surely not entirely ignorant of the language of his fathers; but we can easily prove that he had only the Septuagint version before him, the version that was used also by all the Alexandrian Jews. His mystic interpretations are based mainly upon the expressions of this translation and upon a purely Greek etymology.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_580"></A><A HREF="#fn_580"><FONT SIZE="1">77</FONT></A> Now, then, what is to become of those ingenious procedures used in the Zohar, whose force is entirely destroyed if not applied to the sacred language?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_581"></A><A HREF="#fn_581"><FONT SIZE="1">78</FONT></A> Nevertheless we admit that this difference in form would not be of such very great importance to us, if Philo and the Kabbalists were always to agree upon the choice of the texts, the Scriptural passages upon which they base their philosophical system; or, indeed, if disregarding the language, the same symbols would call forth the same ideas. But this is never so. Thus we do not find, either in the Zohar or in the Book of Formation, the least trace of those rich and ingenious allegories which we consider the sole property of the Alexandrian philosopher. No mention is made in these</p>

<p>works of the personification of the senses in woman, of Eve, our first mother; of voluptuousness in the serpent which advised evil; of egotism in Cain, which man brought forth by uniting with Eve, that is to say, with the senses, after listening to the advice of the serpent; of the mental type in Abel, which entirely despises the body and succumbs through ignorance of mundane things; of the divine science in Abraham; of mundane science in Haggar; of virtue in Sarah; of the primitive nature of regenerated man in Isaac; of ascetic virtue in Jacob, and of faith in Tamar. All these reasons, we believe, justify our saying that Philo's writings exerted no influence whatever upon the Kabbalah.</p>  
<p>We come now to the second deduction which may be drawn from these writings, and from the character of their writer. We have seen how indiscriminately and with what disregard for sound logic Philo pillaged, so to speak, the entire Greek philosophy. What reason have we, then, to credit him with better inventiveness, more sagacity and greater depth in that part of his opinions which reminds us, at least, of the dominant principles of the Kabbalistic system? Are we not justified in thinking that he found also this part all ready made in certain preserved traditions of his co-religionists, and that he only trimmed it with the brilliant colors of his imagination? In this case these traditions were quite old; for Egypt must have received them from the Holy Land before the memory of Jerusalem and of the language of their fathers was entirely extinguished among the Alexandrian Jews.</p>  
<p>But, fortunately, we need not rely upon conjectures. There are facts which prove conclusively that some of the ideas we now speak of were known more than a century before the Christian era. We are assured by Philo himself, as we have said before, that he had drawn from an oral tradition which was preserved by the elders of his people,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_582"></A><A HREF="#fn_582"><FONT SIZE="1">79</FONT></A> attributing to the sect of the Therapeutists the mystic books of a very remote antiquity (De Vita contemplativa) and the use of allegorical interpretations applied</p>

<p>without exception and without reserve to all parts of the Holy Scriptures. "The entire law," he says, "is to them like a living being in which the body is represented by the letter and the soul by a very deep meaning. Through the words, as through a mirror, the rational soul perceives in the latter the most hidden and the most extraordinary wonders."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_583"></A><A HREF="#fn_583"><FONT SIZE="1">80</FONT></A> Let us keep in mind that the same comparison is used in the Zohar, with the difference that beneath the body is put the cloak of the law by which the material deeds of the Bible are designated, and that above the soul is placed a more saintly soul, that is to say, the Divine Word, source of all inspiration and of all truth. But we have still older and more reliable witnesses than Philo.</p>  
<p>We shall begin with the most important of all, the famous version of the Septuagint. The Talmud already had a vague knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_584"></A><A HREF="#fn_584"><FONT SIZE="1">81</FONT></A> of the numerous inaccuracies met with in this famous translation, yet it venerated it very highly. Modern criticism has conclusively proven that the translation was made in behalf of a system extremely hostile&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_585"></A><A HREF="#fn_585"><FONT SIZE="1">82</FONT></A> to biblical anthropomorphism; and there we will find the germ of Philo's mysticism.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_586"></A><A HREF="#fn_586"><FONT SIZE="1">83</FONT></A> Thus, when the sacred text expressly states&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_587"></A><A HREF="#fn_587"><FONT SIZE="1">84</FONT></A> that Moses, his brother and the seventy elders saw the God of Israel sitting upon a throne of sapphire, the Greek translation says that it is not God they have seen, but the place He dwells in.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_588"></A><A HREF="#fn_588"><FONT SIZE="1">85</FONT></A> When another prophet, Isaiah, sees God sitting upon His throne and the folds of His robe filling</p>

<p>the temple, (Isaiah, VI, I) the Septuagint replaces this too material picture by the "glory of God," the Shekinah of the Hebrews.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_589"></A><A HREF="#fn_589"><FONT SIZE="1">86</FONT></A> Jehovah really does not speak to Moses face to face, but in a vision; and it is probable that in the mind of the translator this vision was only an intellectual one.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_590"></A><A HREF="#fn_590"><FONT SIZE="1">87</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Until here we see only the destruction of anthropomorphism and the desire to disengage the idea of God from the, sometimes, sublime images which put Him beyond our intelligence. But here are matters more worthy of our interest. Instead of "Lord Zebaot," the God of Hosts, Whom the Bible represents as another Mars exciting the fury of war and Himself marching into battle,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">88</FONT></A> we find in the Greek translation not the Supreme God, but the forces of which Philo speaks so much in his writings, and the Lord, the God of the forces (&#0954;&#8059;&#0961;&#0953;&#0959;&#0962; &#8001; &#0920;&#0949;&#8056;&#0962; &#0964;&#8182;&#0957; &#0948;&#0965;&#0957;&#0940;&#0956;&#0949;&#0953;&#0969;&#0957;). When comparison is made to the "dew born from the bosom of Aurora,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">89</FONT></A> the anonymous translator substitutes for it that mysterious being which God brought forth from His bosom before the morning star,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">90</FONT></A> that is to say, the Logos, the divine light which preceded the world and the stars. When speaking of Adam and Eve, the Septuagint is careful to adhere strictly to the text that God created them male and female.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_594"><FONT SIZE="1">91</FONT></A> But this twofold character, these two halves of humanity, are united in one and the same being, which is evidently the prototype man, the Adam Kadmon.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_595"></A><A HREF="#fn_595"><FONT SIZE="1">92</FONT></A></p>  
<p>In this curious monument we can also find unquestionable traces of the theory of numbers and of ideas. For example:</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> God is not the creator of heaven and earth in the ordinary sense of the word; He simply made them visible from the invisible state in which they were previously.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_596"></A><A HREF="#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">93</FONT></A> "Who created all these?" asks the Hebrew prophet; "Who made them visible?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_597"></A><A HREF="#fn_597"><FONT SIZE="1">94</FONT></A> says the AIexandrian interpreter. When the same prophet represents the master of the universe commanding the stars like a numerous army,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_598"></A><A HREF="#fn_598"><FONT SIZE="1">95</FONT></A> our interpreter makes him say that God produced the world according to numbers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_599"></A><A HREF="#fn_599"><FONT SIZE="1">96</FONT></A> While an allusion to the doctrines of Plato and Pythagoras is easily found in these diverse passages, we must not forget that the theory of numbers is also taught, although grossly, in the Sefer Yetzirah, and that the theory of ideas is absolutely inseparable from the metaphysics of the Zohar.</p>  
<p>We want to add here that an application of the Pythagorean principle is found in the first of these two monuments which is literally reproduced in the writings of Philo, and for which we shall look in vain in the works of any other Greek writing philosopher. It is because of the influence of the number seven that we possess seven principal organs--the five senses, the organ of speech and the generative organs; and it is for the same reason that there are seven gates of the soul, to wit: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils and one mouth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_600"></A><A HREF="#fn_600"><FONT SIZE="1">97</FONT></A> We find also in the Septuagint another Kabbalistic tradition which was later appropriated to Gnosticism. When the text tells us that "the Most High marked the borders of the nations according to the number of children of Israel," we read in the Alexandrian translation that "the nations were divided according to the number of the angels of</p>

<p>the Lord."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_601"></A><A HREF="#fn_601"><FONT SIZE="1">98</FONT></A> This, apparently odd and arbitrary interpretation,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_602"></A><A HREF="#fn_602"><FONT SIZE="1">99</FONT></A> becomes very intelligible when compared with a passage in the Zohar where we are told that there are seventy nations on earth,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_603"></A><A HREF="#fn_603"><FONT SIZE="1">100</FONT></A> that each of these nations is placed under the power of an angel whom it recognizes as its God, and who, so to speak, is the personification of its own spirit. The children of Israel alone are privileged to have over them no one but the true God Who had chosen them as His people.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_604"></A><A HREF="#fn_604"><FONT SIZE="1">101</FONT></A> We find the same tradition with another sacred writer who is just as old as the Septuagint version.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_605"></A><A HREF="#fn_605"><FONT SIZE="1">102</FONT></A></p>  
<p>No doubt that the Greek philosophy which flourished in the capital of the Ptolomeans exercised a great influence upon this famous translation; but we find ideas there which have evidently been drawn from another source, and which could not even have been brought forth upon Egyptian soil. For were it otherwise, that is, if all the elements pointed out by us, as the allegoric</p>

<p>interpretations of the religious elements, the personification of the Word and its identity with the absolute place, were the result of the general trend of thought of that period, in the land of which we spoke, how is it that during a lapse of two centuries, from the time of the last authors of the Septuagint version until Philo, not the least mention of that trend is made in the history of Greek philosophy?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_606"></A><A HREF="#fn_606"><FONT SIZE="1">103</FONT></A> But we have another, nearly contemporaneous monument, wherein we find the same spirit in a more definite form, and the Hebrew origin of which can not be contested. It is the book of Jesus, son of Sirach, commonly called Ecclesiasticus.</p>  
<p>This religious author is known to us at present only through a Greek translation which came from the pen of his grandson. In a sort of preface we are told by the latter that he came to Egypt (probably after leaving Judea) in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Evergetes II. If we take therefore the original writer to have lived fifty years earlier, we find him two centuries before the Christian era. Without placing implicit faith in the testimony of the translator, who assures us that his grandfather drew only from Hebrew sources, we want to point out that Jesus, the son of Sirach, is often eulogized by the Talmud under the name of Joshuah ben Sirach ben Eliezer.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_607"></A><A HREF="#fn_607"><FONT SIZE="1">104</FONT></A> The original text still existed at the time of St. Jerome, and until the beginning of the fourth century Jews as well as Gentiles counted it among their sacred writings. Now then, we find in the writings of this ancient author not only the traditions of which we just spoke, but also the doctrine of the Logos or of Divine Wisdom nearly in the same form as it is taught by Philo and by the Kabbalists.</p>  
<p>Wisdom is, first of all, the same power as the Word, or the "Memra" of the Chaldean translators. It is <i>the</i> Word; it went</p>

<p>forth from the mouth of the Most High (&#7952;&#0947;&#8060; &#7936;&#0960;&#8056; &#0963;&#0964;&#0972;&#0956;&#0945;&#0964;&#0959;&#0962; &#8017;&#0968;&#0943;&#0963;&#0964;&#0959;&#0965; &#7952;&#0958;&#8134;&#0955;&#0952;&#0959;&#0957;);&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_608"></A><A HREF="#fn_608"><FONT SIZE="1">105</FONT></A> it can not be taken as a simple abstraction, as a purely logical being, for it manifests itself in the midst of its people, in the assembly of the Most High, and praises its soul (&#7952;&#0957; &#0956;&#0941;&#0963;&#8179; &#0955;&#0945;&#0959;&#8166; &#0945;&#8016;&#0964;&#8134;&#0962; &#0954;&#0945;&#0965;&#0967;&#8053;&#0963;&#0949;&#0964;&#0945;&#0953; . . . &#0945;&#7984;&#0957;&#0941;&#0963;&#0949;&#0953; &#0968;&#0965;&#0967;&#8052;&#0957; &#0945;&#8016;&#0964;&#8134;&#0962;). (Ch. XXIV, 1.) This heavenly assembly is probably composed of forces subordinate to it; for the Talmud and Zohar make frequent use of a very similar expression to convey the same thought.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_609"></A><A HREF="#fn_609"><FONT SIZE="1">106</FONT></A> Wisdom, thus introduced upon the scene, presents itself as the firstborn of God; for it existed already at the very beginning, when time was not yet, and it will not cease to exist in the course of ages.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_610"></A><A HREF="#fn_610"><FONT SIZE="1">107</FONT></A> Wisdom has always been with God; (Ch. I, 1.) it is through Wisdom that the world was created; Wisdom alone formed the celestial spheres and descended to the depths of the abyss. Its empire extends over the waves of the ocean, over all regions of the earth, and over all the peoples and all the nations that inhabit it. (Ch. XXIV, 566.) Having been ordered by God to look for a dwelling place here below, its choice fell upon Zion.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_611"></A><A HREF="#fn_611"><FONT SIZE="1">108</FONT></A></p>  
<p>When we consider that, according to our author, every other nation is subject to the influence of an angel or a subordinate power, we ought to look upon the choice of Zion as the dwelling place for Wisdom as a simple metaphor. On the contrary, that choice shows, as the quoted tradition expressly says, that the spirit of God, or the Logos, acted directly without an intermediary, upon the prophets of Israel.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_612"></A><A HREF="#fn_612"><FONT SIZE="1">109</FONT></A> If Wisdom were not something substantial, if it were not in some way the instrument and the servant of God, how could it be conceived sitting upon a throne within a column of clouds, the same column, probably, that marched before the Hebrew people in the desert?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_613"></A><A HREF="#fn_613"><FONT SIZE="1">110</FONT></A> The spirit</p>

<p>of this book, as well as that of the Septuagint version and the Chaldaic paraphrases of Onkelos, consists, on the whole, in placing between the Sovereign Being (&#8001; &#8021;&#0968;&#0953;&#0963;&#0964;&#0959;&#0962;) and this perishable world a mediating power which is, at the same time, eternal and the first work of God; which acts and speaks for Him, and which is itself His word and His creative power.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_614"></A><A HREF="#fn_614"><FONT SIZE="1">111</FONT></A> The abyss between the finite and the infinite is thus filled; heaven and earth are not divorced any longer; God manifests Himself through His word, and His word through the universe. But the Divine Word has no need of being recognized first in the visible things; it sometimes comes directly to man in the form of a holy inspiration, or through the gift of prophecy and revelation.</p>  
<p>It was thus that the nation was raised above all other nations, and a man, the lawgiver of the Hebrews, above all other men. I want to add here that there is no conflict in this, so important, result between theology and criticism. For when we inquire into the most orthodox translations, as that of Sacy, about the work that interests us at present, we shill find many allusions to the doctrine of the Word.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_615"></A><A HREF="#fn_615"><FONT SIZE="1">112</FONT></A> We may say the same of the "Book of Wisdom," where the following passage has long since been found.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_616"></A><A HREF="#fn_616"><FONT SIZE="1">113</FONT></A> "Wisdom is more active than the most active thing . . . It is the breath, that is to say, an emanation of God's power and a very pure effusion of the brightness of the Almighty. It is the reflection of the everlasting light, the spotless mirror of the majesty of God and the image of His goodness. Although only one, it can accomplish everything, and resting immutably in itself, it renews all things. It enters at different times into holy souls and makes them prophets and friends of God." (Ch. VII, 24-27.)</p>  
<p>But it seems to us that the general character of this work comes nearer to the Platonic philosophy than to the mysticism of</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Philo. And as neither the age nor the true origin of this work is known,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_617"></A><A HREF="#fn_617"><FONT SIZE="1">114</FONT></A> we are compelled to wait until a critic, more learned than ours, will have settled these questions.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_618"></A><A HREF="#fn_618"><FONT SIZE="1">115</FONT></A> However, the facts we have collected demonstrate fully that the Kabbalah is neither a child of the Greek civilization of Alexandria, nor of pure Platonism. In fact, were we to treat only of the principle which serves as basis to every Kabbalistic system, namely, the personification of the Word and of the Divine Wisdom considered as the immanent cause of the beings, we can find it at an epoch when the particular Alexandrian spirit was still in the process of being born. And where do we find it? In a traditional translation, so to speak, of the Scriptures, and in another monument of a purely Hebrew origin. When details and secondary ideas are considered, as for example the different applications of the allegorical method, or the deductions that may be drawn from the metaphysical principle of which we have spoken, the great difference between the writings of Philo and those of the Hebrew Kabbalists are easily seen.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_602"></A><A HREF="rph20.htm#fr_602">266:99</A> I omit here Dr. Jellinek's footnote wherein he puts the opinion of the author above that of Dr. Frankel (Preliminary Studies to the Septuagint). We are not concerned here with the criticism of Frankel's opinion. What is of importance, though, is Frankel's remark that the words &#8207;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;&#8206; are sometimes translated in the Septuagint by of &#0959;&#7989; &#7940;&#0947;&#0947;&#0949;&#0955;&#0959;&#0953; &#0964;&#0959;&#8166; &#0920;&#0949;&#0959;&#8166; (the angels of God), and sometimes by &#0965;&#7985;&#0959;&#8054; &#0920;&#0949;&#0959;&#8166; (sons of God). To this Dr. Jellinek makes the following remark: Noteworthy is the following saying of Simeon ben Yohai: &#8207;&#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493; &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1523; &#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1489;&#1512;&#1523; &#1497;&#1493;&#1495;&#1488;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503; &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1491;&#1497;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488;, &#1512;&#1523; &#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1489;&#1503; &#1497;&#1493;&#1495;&#1488;&#1497; &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; &#1502;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500; &#1500;&#1499;&#1500; &#1502;&#1488;&#1503; &#1491;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503; &#1489;&#1504;&#1512; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#0046;&#8206; "R.

This passage shows on the one hand how much R.
