### CHAPTER II

#### RELATION OF THE KABBALAH TO THE ALEXANDRIAN SCHOOL

The metaphysical and religious doctrine which we have gathered from the
Zohar has undoubtedly a more intimate resemblance to the so-called
Neoplatonic philosophy than to pure Platonism. But before pointing out
what is common to both, are we justified in the conclusion that the
first of these two systems is necessarily a copy of the other? One word
would suffice for the solution of this question were we content with a
superficial criticism; for we would have no trouble to establish--and we
did establish in the first part of this book--that the secret doctrine
of the Hebrews existed long before Ammonius Saccas, <span
id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_436.md) Plotinus <span
id="fr_437"></span>[2](#fn_437.md) and Porphyrius <span
id="fr_438"></span>[3](#fn_438.md) changed the aspect of philosophy. But
compelled by weighty reasons, we would rather admit that it took the
Kabbalah several centuries to develop and establish itself in its
definite state. The supposition that the Kabbalah borrowed a great deal
from the Pagan school of Alexandria remained since then in full force,
and merits therefore our serious consideration; especially so when we
bear in mind that after the revolution brought about in the Orient by
the Macedonian armies many Jews adopted the language and the
civilization of their conquerors.

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

We must start from the already proven fact (See Part One)--a fact that
will show itself still clearer as we go along--that the Kabbalah came to
us from Palestine, as attested by its close connection with the
rabbinical institutions. For the Jews of Alexandria spoke Greek, and in
no case would they have made use of the popular and corrupt idiom of the
Holy Land. Now, what relations do we meet with between these countries
and the civilizations they represent, from the time the Neoplatonic
school made its appearance until the middle of the fourth century, a
period during which Judea witnessed the dying of its last schools, of
its last patriarchs, and of the last sparks of its intellectual and
religious life? <span id="fr_439"></span>[4](#fn_439.md) Had the Pagan
philosophy penetrated the Holy Land during this lapse of time, it would
naturally imply the intervention of the Alexandrian Jews, to whom during
a course of several centuries the principal monuments of the Greek
civilization were as familiar as the holy books, a fact borne out by the
Septuagint and the example of Aristobulus.

But the Alexandrian Jews had so little communication with their
Palestinian brethren that they completely ignored the rabbinical
institutions which played such a great role with the latter, and which,
for more than two centuries before the common era, were already deeply
rooted in them. <span id="fr_440"></span>[5](#fn_440.md) When the works of
Philo, the book of Wisdom, and the last book of the Maccabees, both of
which flowed from an Alexandrian pen, are scrutinized carefully, we find
no mention there of any of the names which stand in Judea for the most
sacred authority, as that of the high priest Simon the Just, the last
representative of the Great Synagogue, <span
id="fr_441"></span>[6](#fn_441.md) and those of the tannaim who succeeded
him in

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

veneration by the people. We never find there even an allusion to the
famous disputes of Hillel and Shammai, <span
id="fr_442"></span>[7](#fn_442.md) nor to the different customs which were
collected later in the Mishnah, and which attained legal power. In his
work "Life of Moses," <span id="fr_443"></span>[8](#fn_443.md) Philo does
mention an oral tradition which has been preserved by the Elders of
Israel, and which was usually studied with the text of the Scriptures.
But this tradition, even if not accidentally invented to interweave at
pleasure fables in the life of the Hebrew prophets, has nothing in
common with the traditions which form the basis of the rabbinical cult.
It reminds us of the Midrashim, or those popular, unauthoritative
legends which abound in Judaism at every epoch of its history.

The Palestinian Jews, again, were no better informed of what happened
with their scattered brethren in Egypt. They knew only from hearsay the
pretended version of the Septuagint which dates from a much earlier
epoch than the one holding our attention at present. They eagerly
accepted the fable of Aristeas <span id="fr_444"></span>[9](#fn_444.md)
which harmonized so well with their national self-love and with their
inclination to the marvelous. <span id="fr_445"></span>[10](#fn_445.md) Not
a word is found in

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

the Mishnah and in the two Gemaras which would be applicable either to
the philosopher Aristobulus, to Philo, or to the author of the
apocryphal books mentioned before. Still more surprising is the fact
that the Talmud never mentions either the Therapeutae, <span
id="fr_446"></span>[11](#fn_446.md) or even the Essenes, <span
id="fr_447"></span>[12](#fn_447.md),  <span
id="fr_448"></span>[13](#fn_450.md) although the latter were already well

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

established in the Holy Land during the life of the historian Josephus.
Such silence can be explained only by the origin of these two sects and
by the language they employed for the trans-mission of their doctrines.
Both were brought forth in Egypt, and probably kept up the use of the
Greek language, even upon the soil of their religious fatherland. The
silence of the Talmud, especially with regard to the Essenes, would
otherwise be still more unexplainable; for, according to Josephus, these
sects were known already during the reign, of Jonatas Maccabeus, one
hundred and fifty years before the Christian era. <span
id="fr_451"></span>[14](#fn_451.md)

Can we possibly believe that the Jews of Palestine knew much more of
what was going on in the Pagan schools, equally distant, while they were
so ignorant of matters pertaining to their own brethren some of whom
they could justly have been proud of? We have already said that they
held the Greek language in high esteem; but were they sufficiently
familiar with it to enable them to follow the philosophic trend of their
time? We are perfectly justified in doubting this. For, above all, we
find neither trace nor mention in either Talmud <span
id="fr_452"></span>[15](#fn_452.md) or Zohar of any monument

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

of the Greek civilization. How, then, is it possible to understand a
language when the works it produced are not known? Then again, we learn
from Josephus himself, <span id="fr_453"></span>[16](#fn_453.md) who was
born in Palestine, and who spent most of his life there, that this
famous historian required help for the writing, or rather, for the
translating of his works into Greek. At another place in his works <span
id="fr_454"></span>[17](#fn_454.md) he expresses himself still more
explicitly on this subject, applying in general to his compatriots what
he says of himself; he then adds that the study of languages is looked
upon in his country as a profane occupation, worthy rather of slaves
than of free people; and that, finally, only those are held there in
great esteem and called savants who are very highly proficient in the
knowledge of the religious laws of the Holy Scriptures.

And yet Josephus belonged to one of the most distinguished families. Of
royal blood and of priestly rank, no one was more fit to be initiated in
all the knowledge of the land, in the religious knowledge as well as in
that which prepares one of noble birth for a political life. In devoting
himself to the profane studies, the author of the "Jewish Antiquities"
and of the "Jewish War" was not subject to the same scruples as his
compatriots who remained true to their country and to their
belief. <span id="fr_455"></span>[18](#fn_455.md)

Admitting even that the Greek language was much more cultivated in
Palestine than we are justified in thinking, we are still far from
drawing any conclusion therefrom upon the influence of the Alexandrian
philosophy; for the Talmud makes a clear distinction between the Greek
language and, what it calls the Greek science, <span
id="fr_456"></span>[19](#fn_456.md) ‏חכמת יונות לחוד לשון יונית לחיד‎
(Greek science for itself, Greek language for itself); as much as the
first was

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

respected and honored, so much was the latter execrated. The Mishnah
which, as a collection of legal decisions, expresses itself very
concisely, confines itself to prohibiting the bringing up of children in
Greek learning; it adds, however, that this interdiction was carried out
during the war with Titus. <span id="fr_457"></span>[20](#fn_457.md) The
Gemara, though, is more explicit, and sets that interdiction at an
earlier date. "The following," it says, "has been taught us by our
masters: During the war which raged between the Hasmonian princes,
Hyrcanus laid siege to Jerusalem, and Aristobulus was the
besieged. <span id="fr_458"></span>[21](#fn_458.md).  <span
id="fr_459"></span>[22](#fn_459.md) A chest full of coins was lowered every
day along the outer wall, and in exchange thereof the animals required
for sacrifices were sent up. <span id="fr_460"></span>[23](#fn_460.md) Now,
in the camp of the besieger there was an old man who was at home in the
Greek learning. He said: As long as your enemies are having the means to
hold divine service, they will not fall into your hands. When on the
following day the chest full of coin was lowered as usual, a pig was
sent up instead of the sacrificial animal. When half way up the rampart,
the unclean animal dug its nails into the wall and the land of Israel
trembled four hundred parasangs (Persian miles) around. At that time the
following curse was pronounced:

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cursed be he who
raises pigs; cursed be he who imparts Greek learning to his
children." <span id="fr_462"></span>[24](#fn_462.md)

Barring the fabulous and ridiculous account of the earthquake, this
account is valuable for the critic. The gist is apparently true, for it
is also found in Josephus. (Jewish Antiquities, Vol. XIV, ch. 3.)
According to him Hyrcanus' men promised to give to the besieged
sacrificial animals at one drachma per head, but when the money was
delivered they refused to send the animals. This was considered by the
Jews as doubly odious; for, according to Josephus, it violated not only
the sworn trust in man, but it struck in some way God Himself. When we
add to it the very probable new circumstance that the priests saw coming
into the holy place an animal so utterly disgusting to them instead of
the impatiently expected sacrifice, we can see the measure of blasphemy
and perjury overflowing. Now then, who was responsible for such a crime?
Where are we to look for the first impulse? Surely with those who
neglected the Law of God for the wisdom of other nations. Whether or not
this accusation be well founded, is of little importance; whether the
anathema, justified or caused by that accusation, was pronounced during
the Hasmonean war or during the war of Titus, is of still less
importance to us. What does interest us, though, and what seems to us
also beyond doubt, is the fact that Greek learning was looked upon in
Palestine as a source of impiety, and constituted in itself a double
sacrilege, no matter what degree it attained there. No sympathy, no
alliance, therefore, could take place between those who were suspected
of it and the founders and keepers of rabbinical orthodoxy.

In the name of Rabbi Judah, who heard from an older teacher Samuel, the
Talmud really gives us the following words of Simon, the son of
Gamaliel, who played such a beautiful part in the Acts of the Apostles:
There were a thousand children in the home of my father; five hundred
studied the Law, and five hundred

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

were instructed in Greek learning. Today only myself here and the son of
my father's <span id="fr_463"></span>[25](#fn_463.md) brother in Asia <span
id="fr_464"></span>[26](#fn_464.md) remain. To this objection the Gemara
responds with: An exception is made with the family of Gamaliel because
it was close to the royal court. <span id="fr_465"></span>[27](#fn_465.md)
Let us note, besides, that the entire passage is far from offering the
same character as the previous one; we do not deal here with a general
tradition, <span id="fr_466"></span>[28](#fn_466.md) but with a simple
hearsay of an individual witness who is already far removed from the
source. <span id="fr_467"></span>[29](#fn_467.md) Gamaliel's character, as
pictured by tradition, is best distinguished from that of the other
teachers of the Law by his very attachment to the orthodox wing of
Judaism and by the general respect he inspired (νομοδιδάσκαλος τίμιοσ
παντὶ τῷ λαῷ). <span id="fr_468"></span>[30](#fn_468.md)

It will be seen that such sentiments are not easily compatible with the
accusation of impiety made against the Hellenists. <span
id="fr_469"></span>[31](#fn_469.md) What is more, this patriarch of the
synagogue, quite aged already at the time of the apostles, had been dead
a long time when the school of Alexandria was founded. Finally, since
the house of Gamaliel was an exception, the fact, whatever it may be,
should have disappeared with the cause, and we really do not find later
the least trace of it. Offsetting this obscure and uncertain text,

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

we find another text which is in perfect accord with the strict terms of
the Mishnah. "Ben Domah asked his uncle Rabbi Ismael: Having studied all
of the Law may I also study Greek science? The teacher cited the
following verse to him: The hook of the Law shall not quit thy mouth;
and thou shalt ponder over it day and night. Now then, he added, find an
hour which is neither day nor night, and I shall permit you to devote it
to the study of Greek science." <span id="fr_470"></span>[32](#fn_470.md)

The hypothesis that the Alexandrian philosophy found disciples among the
teachers of Judea is totally overthrown by the passages previously
quoted (and we do not know of any other) which justify our opinion that
they did not even know the word "philosophy." <span
id="fr_471"></span>[33](#fn_471.md)

Indeed, how can that old man who advised Hyrcanus to use against the
enemy the exigencies of the cult--his own cult--be considered a
philosopher! Such a policy would be worthy rather of a Machiavelli! How
can philosophy be counted among the attainments necessary for the
admission to the court of Herod! When we consult the oldest and most
celebrated commentator, R. Solomon bar Isaac, <span
id="fr_472"></span>[34](#fn_472) (Rashi--‏רש״י‎.md), <span
id="fr_473"></span>[35](#fn_473.md) our opinion is confirmed. "By Greek
science," he says, "the Talmud understands a scholastic language spoken
by the courtiers and not understood

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

by the people in general." <span id="fr_474"></span>[36](#fn_474.md) This
explanation, although very sensible, is perhaps a little narrow; but, to
be sure, the doubtful expression to which it refers can not
designate <span id="fr_475"></span>[37](#fn_476.md) anything but a certain
general culture, or rather, a certain intellectual liberty brought about
by the influence of Greek literature.

While the religious traditions of the Jews show such hatred towards any
wisdom coming from the Greeks, it is evident from the following passage
with what enthusiasm, with what adoration

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

and with what superstitious fear they speak of the Kabbalah: "Our
teacher <span id="fr_477"></span>[38](#fn_477.md) Yohanan Ben Zakkai <span
id="fr_478"></span>[39](#fn_479.md) once took to the road, mounted on an
ass and accompanied by Rabbi Eleazar Ben Arak. The latter asked Ben
Zakkai to teach him a chapter of the Merkaba. Did I not tell you,
answered our teacher, that it is forbidden to expound the Merkaba even
to one person unless he be wise and can deduce wisdom of his own
accord? <span id="fr_479"></span>[40](#fn_480.md) Then

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

permit me at least, replied Eleazar, to repeat in your presence what you
taught me of this science. Very well, speak, replied again our teacher;
and thus saying he alighted from the ass, covered his head and sat upon
a stone in the shade of an olive tree. . . . Eleazar, son of Arak, had
hardly begun to speak of the Merkaba, when a fire descended from heaven
and enveloped all the trees of the field, which seemed to sing hymns,
and from the fire there was heard the voice of an angel who expressed
his joy at listening to these secrets. . . . " <span
id="fr_481"></span>[41](#fn_481.md) Later on, when two other teachers
attempted to imitate the example of Eleazar, they were struck by
miracles of no less astonishing a character. Dark clouds suddenly
covered the sky, a rainbow-like meteor dazzled on the horizon, and the
angels were seen hastening to listen, like a curious crowd gathering to
witness a wedding march. <span id="fr_482"></span>[42](#fn_482.md) Is it
still possible to think, after reading these lines, that the Kabbalah is
but a ray pilfered from the sun of Alexandrian Philosophy?

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

However, we can not help acknowledging that there exist certain
resemblances between the Kabbalah and the Neoplatonism of Alexandria
which are impossible to account for except by a common origin; and this
origin, perhaps, we shall have to look for elsewhere than in Judea and
Greece. We need not point out here that the school of Ammonius, like the
school of Simeon ben Yohai, also shrouded itself in mystery, and also
resolved never to divulge the secrets of its doctrines (Porphyrius, Life
of Plotinus); that through the medium of their last disciples, at least,
they too passed themselves for the inheritors of an ancient and
mysterious tradition which emanated, necessarily, from a divine
source; <span id="fr_484"></span>[43](#fn_484.md) that they knew and
applied in the same manner allegorical interpretations; <span
id="fr_485"></span>[44](#fn_485.md) and, finally, that they put the
pretentious enlightenment of enthusiasm and faith above reason. <span
id="fr_486"></span>[45](#fn_486.md) These then are the claims common to all
kinds of mysticism. We shall not dwell upon them and delay thereby our
getting sooner to the following, more important points.

1\. God is to Plotinus and his disciples, as well as to the adepts of
the Kabbalah, the immanent cause of the substantial origin of things.
Everything comes from Him, and everything returns to Him. He is the
beginning and the end of all that is. <span
id="fr_487"></span>[46](#fn_487.md) He is, as Porphyrius says, everywhere
and nowhere. He

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

is everywhere, because all beings are in Him and through Him; He is
nowhere, for He is neither in any particular existence, nor in the sum
of all existences <span id="fr_488"></span>[47](#fn_488.md) He is so far
from being the union of all individual existences, that he is even, says
Plotinus, above existence, in which he sees but one of His
manifestations. If He is superior to existence, He is equally superior
to intelligence which, emanating necessarily from Him, can not reach
Him. Then again, although He is generally called the Unity (τὸ ἕν), or
the First, it would be. more appropriate to give Him no name at all, for
there is no name that can express His essence; He is the Ineffable, the
Unknown (ἄρρητος, ἄγνωστος). <span id="fr_489"></span>[48](#fn_489.md) This
is exactly the status of the Ayn Sof which is always called by the Zohar
the Unknown of the Unknown, the Mystery of Mysteries, and which is
placed by it far above the Sefiroth, even above those which represent
existence in the highest degree of abstraction.

2\. According to the Alexandrian Platonics, God can be conceived only in
the form of a trinity. There is first a general trinity that is composed
of the following three expressions which have been borrowed from the
language of Plato: the Unity or the Good (τὸ ἕν, τὸ ἀγαθόν), the
Intelligence and the Soul of the world (ψυχὴ τοῦ παντός, τῶν ὅλων) or
the Demiurge. <span id="fr_490"></span>[49](#fn_490.md) But each of these
three expressions gives birth to a particular trinity. The Good or the
Unity, in its relations to the beings, is at the same time the principle
of all love, or the object of universal desire (ἐφερτόν), the fulness of
power and possession (ἱκανόν), and, finally, the highest perfection
(τέλειον). As the possessor of the fulness of power, God tends to
manifest Himself outwardly, to become the creating cause; as the object
of love and desire, He attracts to Him all that is, and becomes

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

the final cause; and as the type of highest perfection, He changes these
arrangements into an efficient virtue, the beginning and end of all
existence. <span id="fr_491"></span>[50](#fn_491.md) This first trinity is
called the goodness itself (τριὰς ἀγαθοειδής) Next follows the
intelligible trinity (τριὰς νοητὴ) or divine wisdom, in whose bosom rest
and unite, in its most perfect identity, existence, truth and
intelligible truth, that is to say, the thinking object, the object
thought of and the thought itself. <span
id="fr_492"></span>[51](#fn_492.md),  <span
id="fr_493"></span>[52](#fn_493.md) Finally, the soul of the world, or the
Demiurge, may also be considered a trinity--the demiurgic trinity (τριὰς
δημιουργική). It includes the universal substance or the universal power
which acts in all nature, the motion or generation of beings, and their
return to the bosom of the substance that produced them." <span
id="fr_494"></span>[53](#fn_494.md)

These three aspects of nature may be replaced by three others which
represent in a symbolic manner as many Olympic deities: Jupiter is the
universal Demiurge of the souls and bodies, <span
id="fr_495"></span>[54](#fn_495.md) Neptune reigns over the souls and Pluto
over the bodies. These three particular trinities, which blend and lose
themselves in some way in a general trinity, do not differ much from the
classification of the divine attributes as represented in the Zohar. For
we must not forget that all the Sefiroth are divided into three
categories which, in their totality, also form a general and indivisible
trinity. The first three bear a purely intellectual character, those
following bear a moral character, and the last relate to God as beheld
in nature.

3\. In the same manner the generation of beings, or the

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

manifestation of God's attributes, is shown by the two systems we are
comparing. As we have said before, the doctrine of Plotinus and Proclus
teaches that the intelligence is the very essence of the being, and that
the being and the intelligence are absolutely identical in the bosom of
unity. It therefore follows that all existences of which the world is
composed, and all the aspects under which we may consider them, are but
the development of the absolute thought, or a kind of a creative
dialectic which produces simultaneously light, reality and life <span
id="fr_496"></span>[55](#fn_496.md) For nothing ever separates itself
absolutely from the principle or from the highest unity which is always
immutable and self-resembling. It includes all the beings and all the
forces which we distinguish in the world.

In the lower degrees, finally, the multiplicity and number extends
infinitely; <span id="fr_497"></span>[56](#fn_497.md) but the intelligible
essence of things gradually weakens at the same time, until it sinks to
a mere negation. In this state it becomes matter, which is called by
Porphyrius <span id="fr_498"></span>[57](#fn_498.md) "the absence of all
existence" (ἔλλειψις παντὸς τοῦ ὄντος), or true No-Thing (ἀληθινὸν μὴ
ὃν--Non-Ens), and more poetically represented by Plotinus as the image
of shadows which limit our knowledge, and which are given an
intelligible form by our soul's reflection therein. <span
id="fr_499"></span>[58](#fn_499.md) Let us recall two remarkable passages
in the Zohar where thought, united at first with the being in perfect
identity, successively produces all creatures and all divine attributes
by continually causing its self-consciousness to change and become more
distinct. The elements themselves--I mean the material

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

elements and the different conditions which we observe in space--are
among the things which it eternally produces from its own bosom. (See
Part II, near end.) All the metaphors, therefore, which represent the
supreme principle of things as a source of light which emanates,
inexhaustibly and eternally, rays of light that reveal its presence in
all conditions of infinity, are not always to be taken literally,
whether met with in the Hebrew or in the Alexandrian doctrine. Light,
says Proclus expressly, (Theol. Secund. Plato, liv. II, ch. 4) is here
nothing else but the intelligence or the participation of divine
intelligence (οὐδὲν ἄλλο ἐστὶ τὸ φῶς ἢ μετοισία τῆς Θείας ὑπάρξεως). The
inexhaustible source from which it flows unceasingly, is the absolute
unity which unites in its bosom the being and the thought. <span
id="fr_500"></span>[59](#fn_500.md) It would be useless to repeat here, for
the sake of the Neoplatonic. school, all we have said in the analysis of
the Zohar about the human soul and its union with God through faith and
love. All mystic systems necessarily agree on this point; for it may be
regarded as the basis, the very foundation of mysticism. We shall now
choose this hasty parallel by asking whether it is really possible to
explain such deep and continuous resemblances in a train of thought,
which is hardly accessible to most intelligences, by the identity of
human faculties, or by the general laws of thought? On the other hand,
we believe to have sufficiently demonstrated that the teachers of
Palestine could not have drawn from the Greek civilization, a
civilization so accursed and so anathematized by them, a science of
greater importance even than the study of the Law. With due respect to
the critic, we can not even admit that the Greek philosophers could have
made profitable use of the Jewish tradition. For, while Numenius and
Longinus speak of Moses; while the author of the "Egyptian
Mysteries," <span id="fr_501"></span>[60](#fn_501.md)

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

whoever he may have been, admits angels and archangels into his
theological system, it is probably because of the version of the
Septuagint, or because of the relations that exist between these three
philosophers and the Hellenistic Jews of Egypt. It would be absurd to
draw the conclusion that they were initiated in the formidable mysteries
of the Merkaba.

We are, therefore, to inquire yet whether there exists an older doctrine
from which, unknown to each other, both the Kabbalistic system as well
as the so-called Alexandrian Platonism, sprang. There is no need of
leaving the capital of the Ptolemies for this purpose; for right in the
bosom of the Jewish nation we find a man who may be judged in different
ways, it is true, but who always enjoys splendid fame <span
id="fr_502"></span>[61](#fn_502.md) A man, who is generally looked upon by
the historians of philosophy as the true founder of the Alexandrian
school, while by some critics and by most of the modern historians of
Judaism he is considered the inventor of Hebrew Mysticism. This man
is--Philo. It is, then, his system, as far as there may be one, that we
shall now make the object of our investigation, and endeavor to discover
in his opinions and in his numerous writings the first traces of the
Kabbalah. I say "Kabbalah" only, for the relations of Philo to the Pagan
philosophical schools which have been founded after him, will become
apparent of themselves. Besides, no matter how worthy of interest the
origin of this philosophy may be in the present work, it need but be of
secondary consideration.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[222:10](rph19.htm#fr_445.md) Tractat Megillah,
fol. 9. This passage clearly shows not only that the authors of the
Talmud did not know the Septuagint (there were supposed to be
seventy-two translators), but that, on account of their ignorance of the
Greek language and literature, they could not possibly have known it.
Indeed, in enumerating the changes made in the text of the Pentateuch by
the seventy-two Elders who were especially inspired by the Holy Spirit
for that purpose, they point out ten places, some of which never
existed, some of which not the least trace had been found, and the most
of which are either ridiculous or impossible. Thus, to cite only two
examples, they contend that it was necessary to change the first three
words of Genesis; that instead of Bereshith Bara Elohim (in the
beginning God created), we read Elohim Bara Bereshith (God created in
the beginning); for, they said, had the original arrangement <span
id="page_223">p. 223</span> been retained, king Ptolemy would have
believed that there existed a higher principle than God, and that this
principle was Bereshith.

But I fail to see how such a misapprehension can possibly occur in a
Greek translation, whether the two words ἐν ἀρχῇ be placed at the
beginning or at the end. And who would take these two words as the name
of the divinity? As to the Hebrew word Bereshith, why should it at all
be preserved in any translation? In the passage in Leviticus (XI, 6),
where Moses forbids the use of the hare, they introduce (always in the
name of the Seventy) a still more ridiculous variant. They say that the
Hebrew name of the forbidden animal (‏ארנבת‎--Arnebeth) was the same as
that of Ptolemy's wife, and that the king be not shocked by linking his
wife's name with an impure thought, the following paraphrase was used:
that which is nimble of foot (‏צעירת הרנלים‎ ). They possibly meant to
designate here the family of the Lagidia (hares). But, in any case, it
is impossible to endure any longer this ignorance of history and of
Greek literature. What concerns the paraphrase spoken of above, this is
entirely imaginary.

critic of the sixteenth century (not fifteenth, as given by the

mentioned in the Talmud, can be no other than the Essenes. The proof he
offers is too shallow to deserve the least consideration. <span
id="fr_449"></span>[\*](#fn_448.md) He thinks that the name Baythusim,
‏ביתוסים‎, is a corruption of the word which expresses in Hebrew the
sect of the Essenes, ‏בית אוסים‎ (Beth Uhsim). Yet, relying upon such a
basis, a modern learned critic accepted the identity of these two
religious sects. See Gefroerer, Critical History of Primitive
Christianity, Part II, p. 346, 347.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[223:a](rph19.htm#fr_450.md) Of the same opinion
is Dr. Lippe, an erudite and deep talmudic scholar, who says in the
introduction to his "Das Evangelium Matthaei vor dem Forum der Bibel and
des Talmud" (The Gospel according to Matthew before the Tribunal of
Bible and Talmud, translated by me): It (the sect of the Essenes) is met
with in the Talmud under different names, depending upon the various
peculiarities and occupations in which its members appeared among the
people. They are called "Morning Baptizers" (Haemerobaptists--‏מובלי

<span id="fn_452"></span>[224:15](rph19.htm#fr_452.md) This is disputable
on many points. Besides the great number of Greek words adopted by the
Talmud, I want also to point out that the Mishnah knew already of Homer.
In Tract Yodahyim we read: ‏ספרי המירום אינה מממאין את הידים‎ "The books
of Homer do not defile the hands."

Again, in the Jerusalem Talmud, Tract, Sanhedrin, fol. 28a; ‏ד׳ עקיבע
אומר אף הקורא במפרים ההיצונים כגון ספרי בן סידא וספרי בן

לצנא, אבל ספרי המירום יבא הספרים שנכתבו מיבן ואילך הקורא בהן כקורא
באיגרת‎ "Rabbi Akiba says: Even those who read the irreligious books of
Ben Laon (forfeit the future life); but he who reads the books of Homer
and other similar books, is considered as though reading a letter." That
‏המירום‎ is identical with Homer is admitted by R. Benjamin Musafia.
Compare the talmudical dictionary Aruch under ‏מרים‎, and Musafia's
commentary of it. See also ‏אור אסתר‎ by S. and M. Bondi (Bessau, 1812),

result of the vague historical knowledge of the Gemarists. Compare also
my succeeding note.--Jellinek

<span id="fn_459"></span>[226:22](rph19.htm#fr_459.md) In the Talmud it
really reads: ‏היה הורקנום מבפנים ואדיסטובולום‎ "Hyrcanus was within
(therefore, the besieged) and Aristobulus without (the besieger)"; but
the Talmud, not always exact in matters of historical data, refers here
to the first fraternal struggle (60 B. C.) which does not correspond
with the alleged passage in Josephus. Following Josephus, therefore, I
retained the translation of the author; although the event, according to
the Talmud, would date back still further.--Jellinek

<span id="fn_460"></span>[226:23](rph19.htm#fr_460.md) The author's

incorrect. In the last edition the author took note of Dr. Jellinek's
correction, but still failed to give the correct translation of the
text. He says "Le fils du frère de mon frère," which certainly has no
meaning. Possibly the printer's devil slipped in here, and instead of
the last "frère" it should read here "père." I followed Jellinek's
translation which is the correct one. I only wish to add here that the
last word in this quotation, the word "‏באסיא‎", means "of Asia," or
perhaps "Essa," the name of a place. (See Dr. Kohut's Aruch).--Transl.

Still, it does not interfere with the investigation of the author; on
the contrary, these passages prove that to them philosophy was a source
of impiety.--Jellinek

<span id="fn_473"></span>[229:35](rph19.htm#fr_473.md) In this and similar
cases, Rashi is not an important authority; for he did not understand
Greek. Generally speaking, Rashi may be made better use of for the
Halakah of the Talmud. To Aboda Zora, 54b, for example, Rashi comments
the word ‏פילוסופין‎ with ‏חכמי האומות‎ "Pagan savants," and the
Tosafoth only say (Sabbath, fol. 116a) that they had heard from a Jew
who came from Greece that the Greek meaning of the word ‏פילוסלפום‎ is
"Friend of Wisdom."--Jellinek

<span id="fn_474"></span>[230:36](rph19.htm#fr_474.md) ‏לשון חכמה שמדברים
בני פלטין ואין שאר העם מכירין בו.‎ Rashi, commentary to the words ‏חכמת
יוונית‎ in the quoted passage. Maimonides, in his commentary to the
Mishnah, expresses himself on the same subject as follows: "By the Greek
science we understand the signs--found in all languages--which digress
from the right path, as the allegories <span
id="fr_476"></span>[a](#fn_475.md) and riddles." ‏הרמוים שהם בלשונות שנוטים
מדרך הישרה כמו הרמוים והתידות.‎ "No doubt," he adds, "the Greeks had a
similar language, although no trace of it is left with us." This opinion
is utterly ridiculous, and does not deserve further consideration. We
maintain the same of Gefroerer's opinion (critical History of Primitive
Christianity, Vol. II, p. 352). Depending upon Maimonides' words, the
German critic believes that, according to the Talmudists, the Greek
learning was only a symbolic interpretation of the Scriptures by the
Alexandrian Jews, and he comes to the conclusion that the mystic ideas
of Palestine were borrowed from Egypt. But where can we find the least
connection between these ideas and the advice given to Hyrcanus, or the
customs prevailing at the court of Herod?

<span id="fn_475"></span>[230:a](rph19.htm#fr_476.md) Dr. Jellinek objects
to the author's rendition of ‏רמוים‎ with "enigmas," as well as to
Gefroerer's translation by «ἀλληγορίαι» (allegories). He thinks that the
fundamental meaning of the word is "Andeutungen" (hints, allusions,
suggestions). According to the Aruch of Kohut, the word ‏רמן‎ means "to
wink" (with the eye), or "to nod," and he gives many examples in support
of his opinion. It amounts, after all, to the same thing. An allegory is
nothing else but "a description of one thing under the image of another,
spoken so as to imply something else." (Twentieth Century Dictionary),
or to hint or wink at something.--Transl.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[230:37](rph19.htm#fr_475.md) To find out the real
meaning of the words ‏חכמת יוונית‎ we must go back to the development of
this [expression](errata.htm#21.md). Just as the Greek word «σοφία»
(Sophia) was originally used to express dexterity in corporeal art
(Homer, II, 15, 42). and later to express political wisdom, so is the
Hebrew word ‏חכמה‎ (Hakmah) used in the latter sense. The Jews express
by ‏חכמה‎ what the Greeks express by σοφία. Now, then, as politics and
political wisdom are part of σοφία, the Jews, therefore, understand by
‏חכמת יוונית‎--politics, and for this reason also the special
designation ‏יוונית‎. This conception of ‏חכמת יוונית‎ will cast much
light on the quoted passage of the Talmud. Compare also further on about
the conception of ‏חכמה‎--Jellinek

<span id="fn_477"></span>[231:38](rph19.htm#fr_477.md) We thus translate
the word ‏רבן‎ (Rabban) not because it is a higher title than that of
‏רבי‎ (Rabbi), but because it is probably an abbreviation of the word
‏רבנו‎ (rabbenu) which literally means "our teacher;" "rabbi" means "my
teacher." The first of these titles belongs to the Tannaim, and
expresses more general authority than the second. <span
id="fr_480"></span>[\*](#fn_478.md)

<span id="fn_478"></span>[231:\*](rph19.htm#fr_480.md) More distinctly
expressed, ‏רבי‎ is the title peculiar to the Tannaim; ‏רב‎ (Rab)
belongs to the Amariam. Besides, it is not settled whether the "‏ן‎"
(final Nun) in ‏רבן‎ (Rabban) is the abbreviated plural ending; for *an*
(like the *an* in Arabic) is the connecting syllable of many nouns in
Aramaic. The title ‏רבן‎ was given to Gamaliel I, II, III, and to
Hananyah, the son of Gamaliel. This would lead to believe that the title
‏רבן‎ included also the idea of popular esteem.--Jellinek

<span id="fn_479"></span>[231:39](rph19.htm#fr_478.md) I can not desist
from giving here some footnotes found in the German translation of the
first edition; they seem to me of some importance. This paragraph ends
somewhat differently there. The author mentions Yohanan ben Zakkai as
living before Gamaliel, the contemporary of the apostles. He makes the
following footnote: "Yohanan ben Zakkai was the immediate disciple of
Hillel the Elder, whose grandson was Gamaliel; Yohanan, therefore, must
have been older (Tract. Sukah, fol. 28. Yost, History of the Israelites,
Vol. III, 114 and 170). To this Dr. Jellinek remarks the following: "In
the seventh volume of ‏כרם חמד‎--Lovely Vineyard--(Prague, 1843, S.
Landau) there are very pointed remarks made by Dr. Michael Sachs on the
character of Yohanan ben Zakkai. Especially noteworthy is the fifteenth
Mishnah of the ninth chapter of the Tractate Sota to which he refers.
There it reads: ‏משמת ר׳ יוחנן בן זכאי בטל זיו חכמה.‎ 'When Rabbi
Yohanan ben Zakkai died, the splendor of wisdom vanished.' The point at
issue here is the correct meaning of the word ‏חבמה‎ (Wisdom). But Dr.
Sachs himself veils the interpretation of this word in mystery, and the
reader is at a loss to know what he is to understand by it. Although
this scholar is loath to identify it with the Kabbalah, he nevertheless
admits that it has some connection with the Merkaba. I am, indeed, far
from supporting the opinion that this ‏חבמה‎ (Hakmah--Wisdom) is the
Kabbalah as presented to us by the Zohar; yet, it stems to me that it
belongs at least into that class, and that it testifies to the great age
of the Kabbalistic ideas."--Transl.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[231:40](rph19.htm#fr_479.md) In the text: ‏ולא
במרכבה ביחיד אלא אם כן היה חכם ומבין מדעתו‎

These words prove best the old age of the first Mishnah of the section
in Haggiga. It is well known that the editor of the Mishnah collected
the sayings of other teachers. Accordingly, these words, found in the
<span id="page_232">p. 232</span> quoted Mishnah, belong to Yohanan ben
Zakkai, the disciple of Hillel (Sukah, fol. 28). Compare further on
about Yohanan ben Zakkai.--Jellinek

<span id="fn_481"></span>[232:41](rph19.htm#fr_481.md) Babyl. Talmud,
Tract. Haggiga, fol. 14b.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[232:42](rph19.htm#fr_482.md) Babyl. Talmud,
Tract. Haggiga, fol. 14b. These two passages form but one passage which
does not end at the place we stopped. We must add the account of the
dream narrated by R. Yohanan when he was told of the miracles performed
by his disciples: "You and I were on the Mount Sinai when from on high
in heaven there came a voice that said: Come up here, come up here!
Spacious banquet halls and beautiful sofas are reserved for you. You,
your disciples, and the disciples of your disciples are destined for the
third class." <span id="fr_483"></span>[\*](#fn_483.md) Do not the last
four words hint to the four worlds of the Kabbalists? This conjecture
gains in certainty when we consider that above the third degree is the
world of B’ree-ah of the divine attributes only.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[232:\*](rph19.htm#fr_483.md) Rashi comments on
the expression ‏כת שלישית‎ (third class) with: ‏ג׳ כתית היושבות לפני
השכינא‎ "three classes that dwell before the Shekinah." This explanation
is also subscribed to by the Jerusalem Talmud which adds: ‏אתיא כמ׳ד
שובע שמחית את פניךּ שבע כתית של צדיקים לעתיד לבוא.‎--"this is taken in
the sense of one who concludes from the following words of the Psalms:
In Thy presence is fulness of joy (Psalms, XVI, 2)--that there are seven
classes of righteous ones in the world to come (by substituting the word
‏שובע‎--to fill, to sate, the word ‏שבע‎--seven)." This has, therefore,
nothing in common with the worlds of the Kabbalists. Besides, all these
tales are united into one story in the Jerusalem Talmud, which would
also point to the legendary and uncertain character of this
story.--Jellinek.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[233:43](rph19.htm#fr_484.md) According to Proclus
the philosophy of Plato existed at all times in the minds of exceptional
men. As a mystery it was transmitted from generation to generation to
Plato who communicated it to his disciples. Ἁπάσαν μὲν τοῦ Πλάτωνος
φιλοσοφίαν καὶ τὴν ἀρχὴν ἐκλάμψαι νομίζω κατὰ τὴν κρειττόνων ἀγαθοειδῆ
βούλησιν . . . τῆς τε ἄλλης ἁπάσης ἱμᾶς μετόχους καττέστησε τοῦ Πλάτωνος

<span id="fn_485"></span>[233:44](rph19.htm#fr_485.md) There are three ways
of speaking of God, says Proclus: the mystic or divine, ἐνθεαστικῶς; the
dialectic, διαλεκτικῶς; and the symbolical, συμβολικῶς Ib. supr. Ch. IV.
This distinction reminds of the "three cloaks of the Law" accepted by
the Zohar.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[233:45](rph19.htm#fr_486.md) This preference is
