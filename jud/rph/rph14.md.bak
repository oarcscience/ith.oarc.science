### CHAPTER II

#### ANALYSIS OF THE ZOHAR

#### ALLEGORICAL METHOD OF THE KABBALISTS

As the authors who contributed to the formation of the Zohar give us
their ideas in the humblest and the least logical shape, in the form of
a simple commentary on the Five Books of Moses, we may, without failing
in respect or fidelity to them, pursue the plan that seems most suitable
to us. And, first of all, it is important to know how they understand
the interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures, how they succeeded in using
them as a support at the moment when they deviate most from them. For,
as we have said before, such is their method of interpretation; and,
generally speaking, there is no other basis to symbolic mysticism.

Let us give here their own judgment on this point: Woe to the man who
sees nothing but simple stories and ordinary words in the law! For were
this so, we could even nowadays frame a law which would deserve higher
praise. Were it our desire to find nothing but simple words, we should
have nothing to do but to turn to the legislators of the earth, among
whom more grandeur is frequently found. <span
id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_248.md) It would be sufficient to imitate them,
and to make a law according to their words and to their example. But it
is not so; every word of the law holds an exalted meaning and a sublime
mystery.

"The recitals of the law are the vestment of the law. Woe

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

to him who takes that vestment for the law itself! David had this in
mind when he said: Open Thou my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things
out of Thy law (Psalms 119, 18), i.e., what is hidden under the cloak of
this law."

"There are foolish people who, when they see a man covered with fine
clothes, look no further than the garment, and yet it is the body that
lends value to the clothes; <span id="fr_249"></span>[2](#fn_249.md) and
still more precious is the soul. The law also has its body. There are
commandments that may be called the body of the law, and the ordinary
recitals which are mingled with them are the clothes which cover the
body. The simple-minded take heed of nothing but the vestments or the
recitals of the law; they know nothing else, and do not see what is
hidden under this garment. The well-informed think not of the vestment,
but of the body that the vestment covers. Finally, the wise, servants of
the Supreme King, they who dwell upon the heights of Sinai, think of the
soul only, which is the foundation of all the rest, and which is the law
itself, and in time to come they will be prepared to contemplate the
spirit of that spirit which breathes in the law." <span
id="fr_250"></span>[3](#fn_250.md)

Thus, by the sincere or insincere supposition of a mysterious meaning,
unknown to the profane, the Kabbalists first placed themselves above the
historic facts and the positive precepts which compose the Scriptures.
This was their only means of assuring

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

themselves of full liberty without openly breaking with religious
authority; and, possibly, they felt the need of doing something to
assuage their consciences. We find the same spirit in a form still more
remarkable in the following lines: "If the law consisted of nothing but
ordinary words and recitals, like the words of Esau, of Hagar, of Laban,
of Balaam's ass, and of Balaam himself, why should it have been called
the law of truth, the perfect law, the faithful testimony of God? Why
should the wise man <span id="fr_251"></span>[4](#fn_251.md) deem it more
precious than gold and pearls? But it is not so. Every word hides a very
high meaning; every recital contains more than events it seems to
contain. And that higher and more holy law is the true law." <span
id="fr_252"></span>[5](#fn_252.md)

It is of some interest to find similar views and similar expressions in
the works of a father of the church. "Were we obliged," says Origen, "to
hold to the letter of the law, and to understand what is written in the
law as the Jews and the people understand it, I should blush to tell
aloud that it is God who gave us such laws; I should find, then, more
grandeur, and more reason in the laws of man, as for instance, in the
laws of Athens, of Rome, or of Lacedemonia. . . ." <span
id="fr_253"></span>[6](#fn_253.md)

"What sensible man, pray," says the same author, "could be made to
believe that the first, the second and the third days of the creation,
where morning and evening is still mentioned, could exist without sun,
moon and stars, when on the first day, there was not even a sky? Where
will we find a mind so limited as to believe that God, like a ploughman,
engaged in planting trees in

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

the garden of Eden, situated toward the East; that one of the trees was
the tree of life, and that another tree could give the knowledge of good
and evil? I think that no one could hesitate to regard these things as
parables under which are hidden mysteries." <span
id="fr_254"></span>[7](#fn_254.md)

Finally, he also admits the differentiation between an historical, a
legislative or moral meaning, and a mystical meaning; but instead of
using the clothes that cover us as a simile, he compares the first to
the body, the second to the soul, and the last to the spirit. <span
id="fr_255"></span>[8](#fn_255.md) In order to establish, at least, certain
apparent relations between the sacred word and these arbitrary
interpretations, the ancient Kabbalists sometimes resorted to artificial
means very rarely met with in the Zohar, but which have taken up
considerable space and authority with the modern Kabbalists. <span
id="fr_256"></span>[9](#fn_256.md) As these means are, by their very
nature, unworthy of all interest, as they never serve as basis to any
important idea, and as they have been discussed by a great many, we pass
them in silence that we may more quickly come to the essential subject
of our researches, to the doctrine which is the fruit of that feigned
independence, and which forms the unity and basis of these pretended
commentaries.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

We shall first try to present the nature and attributes of God according
to the most ancient fragments of the Zohar. We shall then set forth the
idea which they have given us--I do not say of the creation, but of the
formation of beings in general, or of the relations of God with the
universe. Finally, we shall consider man; we shall tell how he is
conceived under his chief aspects, and how his origin, his nature and
his destinies are described. We consider this way of proceeding not only
the simplest and the easiest, but we believe that the dominant character
of the system imposes it upon us.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[140:1](rph14.htm#fr_248.md) ‏אי לאהזאה מלי דעלמא
אפילו איגון קפסירי דעלמא אית בינייהו מילין עלאין יתיר אי הכי ניזיל
אבתרייהן ונעביד מנייהו אורייתא.‎ (As the text was too long to be quoted
in its entirety, a selection has been made.)

<span id="fn_249"></span>[141:2](rph14.htm#fr_249.md) In this edition the
author deviates slightly from the original text and follows the
interpretation of Dr. Jellinek. In the first edition the translation
reads: "There are foolish people, who, when they see a man covered with
fine clothes look no further than the garment, *and* take the garment
for the body." Dr. Jellinek makes the following interesting remark to
this passage: "The author translated here faithfully the text, just as I
rendered literally the French text. Yet, I believe that the text of the
Zohar is corrupted here; for the example given is inconsistent in
itself, as every thoughtful reader will easily see. I would therefore
change the ‏השיבו דההוא לבושא‎ of the text, where ‏השיבו‎ is used as a
verb, into the noun ‏השיבות‎, and have the sentence refer not to the
foolish people, but make it exclamatory of the Zohar itself. This
conjecture is supported by the following ‏השיבות דנופא נשמתא‎."--Transl.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[141:3](rph14.htm#fr_250.md) Zohar, part III, fol.
152a, sec. ‏בהעלותךּ‎ (B’haleth-ho).

<span id="fn_251"></span>[142:4](rph14.htm#fr_251.md) Refers to David and
to Psalms, XIX, 11. "They are those which are to be desired more than
gold, and much fine gold . . ." The author mistook the word is ‏פז‎
(Poz);--fine gold, for ‏פינים‎ (P’ninim)--pearls.--Transl.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[142:5](rph14.htm#fr_252.md) ‏אלא ודאי אוריתא
קרישא עלאה איהי אוריתא דקשוט תורת ה׳ תמימה.‎--Part III, Fol. 149b.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[142:6](rph14.htm#fr_253.md) Si absideamus
litterae et secundum hoc vel quod Judaeis, vel quad vulgo videtur,
accipiamus quae in lege scripta sunt, erubesco dicere et confiteri quia
tales leges dederit Deus; videbunter enim magis elegantes et
rationabiles hominum leges, verbi gratia, vel Romanorum, vel
Atheniensium, vel Lacedaemoniorum."--Homil. 7, in Levit.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[143:7](rph14.htm#fr_254.md) Cuinam quaeso sensum
habenti convenienter videbitur dictum quod dies prima, et secunda et
tertia, in quibus et vespera nominatur et mane, fuerint sine sole, et
sine luna, et sine stellis: prima autem dies sine coelo? Quis vero ita
idiotes invenitur ut putet, velut hominem quemdam agricolam, Deum
plantasse arbores in Paradiso, in Eden, contra orientem, et arborem
vitae plantasse in eo, ita ut manducans quis ex ea arbore vitam
percipiat? et rursus ex alia manducans arbore, boni et mali scientiam
capiat? etc., περὶ ἀρχῶν, liv. IV, ch. II, Huet, Origeniana, p. 167.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[143:8](rph14.htm#fr_255.md) "Triplicem in
Scripturis divinis intelligentiae modum, historicum, moralem, et
mysticum: unde et corpus finesse et animam ac spiritum
intelleximus."--Hamil. 5, in Levit.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[143:9](rph14.htm#fr_256.md) Those names are three
in number: one, ‏גימטריא‎ (Gematria), consists in setting one word in
place of another word which has the same numerical value; the other,
‏נוטריקין‎ (Notarikon), makes each letter of a word the initial of
another word. Finally, by virtue of the last, ‏תמורה‎ (Temurah), the
value of the letters is changed: for instance, the last letter takes the
place of the first, and reciprocally. See Reuchlin's De Arte
cabalistica, Wolf's second vol. of the Bibliotheca Hebr.; Basnage, Hist.
des Juifs, etc., etc.
