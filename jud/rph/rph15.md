### CHAPTER III

#### CONTINUATION OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE ZOHAR

#### THE KABBALISTS' CONCEPTION OF THE NATURE OF GOD

The Kabbalists speak of God in two ways which in no wise impair the
unity of their thought. When they attempt to define God, when they
distinguish His attributes, and wish to give us a precise idea of His
nature, they speak in the language of metaphysics, with all the lucidity
permissible in matters of such nature and by the idiom in which they are
expressed. But sometimes they represent the divinity as a being which
can not be comprehended at all, a being that lives always above all the
forms with which our imagination may clothe it. In the latter case all
their expressions are poetical and figurative, and then they combat, as
it were, imagination with the weapons of imagination; then all their
efforts tend to destroy anthropomorphism by giving it such gigantic
proportions, that the frightened mind can find no term of comparison,
and is compelled to rest in the idea of the Infinite.

The Book of the Mystery is written entirely in this style; but as the
allegories it employs are all too often puzzling, we shall rather cite a
passage of the Idra Rabba <span id="fr_257"></span>[1](#fn_257.md) in
confirmation of what

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

we have said. "Simeon ben Yohai had just assembled his disciples. He
told them that the time had come to work for the Lord, that is to say,
to make known the real meaning of the law; that his days were numbered,
that the laborers were few and the voice of the creditor, the voice of
the Lord, became more and more urgent. <span
id="fr_258"></span>[2](#fn_258.md) He made them swear that they would not
profane the mysteries he was about to confide to them. <span
id="fr_259"></span>[3](#fn_259.md) They repaired to a field and sat down in
the shadows of the trees. Simeon was about to interrupt the silence by
his speech, when a voice was heard and their knees knocked one against
another <span id="fr_260"></span>[4](#fn_260.md) with fear. What was that
voice? It was the voice of the celestial assembly which assembled to
listen. Rabbi Simeon exclaimed joyfully: Lord, I have heard Thy voice,
(Habakkuk, III, 1) but I shall not add like that prophet did--'I fear,'
for this is not the time of fear, it is the time of love, as it is
written: Thou shalt love the Eternal Lord, thy God." (Zohar, pt. III,
fol. 128a.)

After this introduction, which lacks neither pomp nor interest, follows
a long, entirely allegorical, description of the divine greatness. Here
are some outlines: "He is the Ancient of the Ancients, the Mystery of
the Mysteries, the Unknown of the Unknown. He has a form peculiar to
Him, since He appears to us preferably as the Aged, as the Ancient of
Ancients, as the Unknown among the Unknown. But under the form that we

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

know Him, He still remains unknown to us. His vestment is white, and His
appearance is that of a brilliant visage." <span
id="fr_261"></span>[5](#fn_261.md)

"He is seated on a throne of fiery sparks which He subjects to His will.
The white light emitted by His head illumines four hundred thousand
worlds. This white light becomes the inheritance of the just in the
world to come. <span id="fr_262"></span>[6](#fn_262.md) Each day sees
thirteen myriads of worlds come to light from His skull, which receive
from Him their subsistence, and the weight of which He alone supports.
From His skull springs a dew which fills His head, and which will awaken
the dead to a new life. For therefore it was written (Isaiah, XXVI, 19):
For a dew of light is Thy dew. It is this dew which is the nourishment
of the greatest saints. It is the manna which is prepared for the just
in the life to come. It falls in the fields of the sacred fruits. <span
id="fr_263"></span>[7](#fn_263.md) The aspect of that dew is white as the
diamond whose color contains all colors. . . . The length of that face,
from the summit of the skull, is three hundred and seventy thousand
myriad worlds, and it is called the long face, for such is the name of
the Ancient of the Ancients." <span id="fr_264"></span>[8](#fn_264.md)

But we should fail in the truth were we to give the impression that the
rest be judged by this example. Oddness, affectation and habit, which in
the Orient so often abuse allegory even to subtlety, hold a larger place
in it than nobility and grandeur. That head, dazzling with light, used
to represent the eternal hearth of existence and of science, becomes, so
to speak, the [subject](errata.htm#13.md) of an anatomical study; neither
the forehead, nor the face, nor the

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

eyes, nor the brain, nor the hair, nor the beard, nothing is forgotten;
everything gives an opportunity of enunciating numbers and propositions
which point out the Infinite. <span id="fr_265"></span>[9](#fn_265.md) This
evidently is what provoked the reproach of anthropomorphism and even of
materialism which some modern writers have directed against the
Kabbalists. But neither that accusation nor the form which called it
forth are worthy of further consideration. We shall rather make an
attempt to translate some of the fragments in which the same subject is
treated in a manner more interesting to philosophy and to human
intelligence.

The first one we shall cite forms a complete total of great extent, and
by that fact alone it recommends itself to our attention. Under pretence
of making known the true meaning of the words of Isaiah (Ch. XL, 25):
"To whom then will ye liken me that I shall be equal to? saith the Holy
One," it explains the genesis of the ten Sefiroth, or chief attributes
of God, and the nature of God Himself while yet concealing Himself in
His own substance. "Before having created any form in the world, before
He produced any image, He was alone, without form, without resembling
anything, and who could conceive Him as He was then, before the
creation, since He was formless? It is therefore forbidden to represent
Him by any image, by any form whatever, even by His holy name, even by a
letter or by a point. That is the meaning of the words (Deut. IV, 15):
'For ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto
you.' That is to say, you saw nothing that you can represent under any
form or by any image. But after having produced the form of the Heavenly
Man, ‏אדמ עלאה‎ (Adam E-to-oh) He used it as a chariot, ‏מרכבה‎
Merkabah, to descend; He wished to be called by that form which is the
holy name of Jehovah; He wished to be known by His attributes, by each
attribute separately, and let Himself be called the God of Mercy, the
God of Justice,

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

the All Powerful God, the God of Hosts, and the One Who Is. His
intention was to make known His qualities, and how His justice and His
mercy embrace the world as well as the work of man. Had He not shed His
light over all creatures, how could we have known Him? How would. it be
true to say that the world is full of His glory? (Isaiah VI, 2.) Woe to
the man who dares compare Him even to one of His own attributes! Much
less is He to be likened to man, born of earth and destined to death. He
must be conceived as above all creatures and above all attributes.

"When all those things have been taken away, there is neither attribute,
nor image, nor figure; that which remains is like a sea, for the waters
of the sea are in themselves limitless and without form; but when they
spread over the earth they produce an image, ‏דמיון‎ (Dimyon), and we
can make the following calculation: The source of the waters of the sea
and the jet springing from it to spread over the ground, make two. Then
an immense basin forms, as a basin is formed when a pit of vast depth is
dug; that basin is occupied by the waters which have sprung from the
source, and that is the sea itself, which should be counted as the
third. And this vast depth divides itself into seven canals which
resemble seven long vessels. The source, the jet, the sea and the seven
canals together make the number ten. And if the master who constructed
those vessels breaks them, the waters return to their source, and only
the fragments of the vessels, dry, without water, remain. Thus, the
cause of the causes produced the ten Sefiroth. The Crown is the source
from which an unending light springs forth, and therefore the name
'Infinite' ‏אין סוף‎ (Ayn Sof), to designate the Supreme Cause for in
that state it has neither form nor countenance; therefore, there is no
means of comprehending it, and no way of knowing it; and it is in this
sense that it is said: 'Meditate not upon the thing that is too far
above thee, and investigate not what is covered from

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

thee.' <span id="fr_266"></span>[10](#fn_266.md) Then a vessel comes into
existence, as restricted in dimensions as a point--as the letter ‏י‎
(Yod)--in which, nevertheless, the divine light penetrates. This is the
source of wisdom, it is wisdom, by virtue of which the supreme cause
takes the name of the all-wise God. After which it constructs a great
vessel like the sea, called the intelligence, whence the name of God the
'Intelligent.' We must know, however, that God is good and wise by
virtue of Himself; for wisdom does not deserve its name because of
itself, but because of Him Who is wise, and Who produces wisdom from the
light emanated from Him. Neither is intelligence conceivable by itself,
but through Him Who is the Intelligent One, and Who replenishes it from
His own substance. He need only to withdraw to let it dry out entirely.
In this sense we should also understand the following words (Job XIV,
11): 'The waters run off from the sea and the river faileth and drieth
up.'

"Finally, the sea is divided into seven branches, and from these result
the seven precious vessels called Mercy or Grandeur, Justice or
Strength, Beauty, Triumph, Glory, Kingdom and the Foundation or
Basis. <span id="fr_267"></span>[11](#fn_267.md) For that reason He is
called the Great or the Merciful, the Strong, the Magnificent, the God
of Victory, the Creator to whom belongs all glory, and the foundation of
all things. This last attribute sustains all the others, as well as all
the worlds. Last of all, He is also the king of the universe; for all
things are in His power. He can diminish the number of the vessels, and
He can increase the light which breaks forth from them, or the contrary
if He deems preferable." <span id="fr_268"></span>[12](#fn_269.md) All that
the Kabbalists have thought of the nature of God is summed up

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

nearly in this text. But even in the minds most familiar with
metaphysical systems and questions, this text must leave some confusion.
On the one hand it should be followed by quite wide developments; on the
other hand, it would be well to present each one of the principles
confined therein under a more substantial and more precise form. In
order to attain this double aim without compromising historical truth,
and without fear of substituting our own thoughts for those whose
spokesman we wish to be, we shall reduce the foregoing passage to a
small number of fundamental propositions, each one of which will be
elucidated, and at the same time justified by other extracts from the
Zohar.

1\. God is, before all else, the Infinite Being; He can therefore not be
considered as the totality of the beings, nor as the sum of His own
attributes. But without these attributes and without the effects which
result from them, that is to say, without a definite form, it is never
possible either to comprehend or to know Him. This principle is quite
clearly expressed when it is said that "before the creation God was
without form, resembling nothing; and that in this state no intelligence
could conceive Him." But as we do not wish to confine ourselves to this
one testimony, we hope that it will not be difficult to recognize the
same thought in the following words:

"Before God manifested Himself, when all things were still hidden in
Him, He was the least known among all the unknown. In that state He had
no name other than the name that expresses interrogation. He began by
forming an imperceptible point; that was His own thought. He then began
to construct with this thought a mysterious and holy form; finally He
covered it with a rich and radiant garment; we mean the universe whose
name necessarily enters into the name of God." <span
id="fr_270"></span>[13](#fn_270.md) We read also in

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

the Idra Zutah (the lesser assembly), whose importance we have noted
more than once: "The Ancient of Ancients is at the same time the Unknown
of the Unknown; He separates Himself from all, and He is not separated;
for all unites with Him, as He again unites with all; there is nothing
that is not in Him. He has a form, and it may be said He has no form. By
taking a form He gave existence to all that is; <span
id="fr_271"></span>[14](#fn_271.md) first, He caused His form to send out
ten lights <span id="fr_272"></span>[15](#fn_272.md) which shine by virtue
of the form they borrowed of Him, diffusing a dazzling effulgence to all
sides, just as a beam sends out its luminous rays to all sides. The
Ancient of Ancients, the Unknown of the Unknown is a high beacon which
is recognized only by the rays that glare our eyes with such brilliancy
and abundance. This light is called His holy name." <span
id="fr_273"></span>[16](#fn_273.md)

2\. The ten Sefiroth, by which the Infinite Being first manifested
Himself, are nothing but attributes which, by themselves, have no
substantial reality. In each of those attributes the divine substance is
present in its entirety, and, taken all together, they constitute the
first, the most complete and highest of all the divine manifestations.
It is called the "archetypal or celestial man" ‏אדם קדמון, אדם
עלאה‎ <span id="fr_274"></span>[17](#fn_274.md) This is the figure which
dominates the mysterious chariot of Ezekiel, and of which the
terrestrial man, as we shall soon see, is but a faint copy. "The form of
man," says Simeon ben Yohai to his disciples, "contains all that is in
heaven above and upon earth below, the superior as well as the inferior
beings; it is for that reason that the Ancient

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

of the Ancients has chosen it for His own. <span
id="fr_275"></span>[18](#fn_275.md) No form, no world could subsist before
the human form, for it contains all things, and all that is, subsists
only by virtue of it: without it there would be no world, for thus it is
written (Prov. III, 19): 'The Lord has through wisdom founded the
earth.'

But it is necessary to distinguish the higher man (Adam d’leeloh) ‏אדם
דלעילא‎ from the lower man: ‏אדם דלתתא‎ (Adam d’letâtoh), for one could
not exist without the other. On that form of man rests the perfection of
faith in all things, and it is that form that is spoken of when it is
said that they saw above the chariot like the form of a man; and it is
of that form that Daniel spoke in the following words (Daniel VII, 13):
'I saw in the nightly vision and behold, one like the son of man came
with the clouds of heaven, and he came even to the Ancient of days, and
he was brought near before Him.'" <span id="fr_276"></span>[19](#fn_276.md)
Thus, what is called the Celestial Man, or the first divine
manifestation, is nothing else than the absolute form of all that
exists; the source of all the other forms, or rather of all ideas, the
supreme thought, otherwise called also the λόγος or the Word. We do not
pretend to express here a simple conjecture but an historical fact, the
accuracy of which will be the more appreciated the more extensive the
knowledge of the system will become. However, before proceeding, we may
cite yet these words: "The form of the Ancient (Whose name be
sanctified!) is an unique form which embraces all forms. It is the
supreme and mysterious wisdom which contains all the rest." <span
id="fr_277"></span>[20](#fn_277.md)

3\. The ten Sefiroth, if we may believe the authors of the Zohar, are
already indicated in the Old Testament by as many

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

special names consecrated to God, the same ten mystical names, as we
have already remarked, spoken of by St. Jerome in his letter to
Marcella <span id="fr_278"></span>[21](#fn_278.md) An attempt has been made
to find them also in the Mishnah, since it says there that God created
the world with ten words, (‏בעשרה מאמרות נברא העולם‎) <span
id="fr_279"></span>[22](#fn_279.md) or by as many orders issued from His
sovereign word. <span id="fr_280"></span>[23](#fn_280.md) Although all are
equally necessary, yet the attributes and the distinctions expressed by
them do not give us the same sublime conception of the divine nature,
but represent it to us under different aspects which are called in the
language of the Kabbalists "faces," (‏אנפין‎--Anfin,
‏פרצופין‎--Partzufin) <span id="fr_281"></span>[24](#fn_281.md)

Simeon ben Yohai and his disciples make frequent use of that
metaphorical expression, but they do not abuse it as their modern
successors have done. We shall linger upon this point which is,
unquestionably, the most important point of the entire Kabbalistic
science; and before determining the particular character of each one of
the Sefiroth, we shall cast a glance at the general question of their
essence; and set forth in a few words the different opinions to which
they gave rise among the adepts of the doctrine of the Kabbalah.

All Kabbalists have raised these two questions: first, why are there
Sefiroth? then, what are the Sefiroth considered as a whole, whether in
relation to themselves, or in relation to God? As to the first question,
the texts of the Zohar are too positive to give room to the least doubt.
There are Sefiroth as there are names of God, since the two things are
confounded in the mind, and since the Sefiroth are but the ideas and the
things expressed by the names. Now, if God could not be named, or if all
the

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

names given to Him did not designate a real thing, not only would we not
know Him, but He would not exist even for Himself; for without
intelligence He could not comprehend Himself, neither could He be wise
without wisdom, nor could He act without power. <span
id="fr_282"></span>[25](#fn_282.md)

The second question, though, has not been solved by all in the same
manner. Some, standing on the principle that God is immutable, see in
the Sefiroth nothing but instruments of the divine power, creatures of a
superior nature, but differing entirely from the first Being. These are
they who would reconcile the language of the Kabbalah with the letter of
the law. <span id="fr_283"></span>[26](#fn_283.md) Others, carrying to its
last consequences the old principle that nothing can come from nothing,
fully identify the ten Sefiroth with the divine substance. That which
the Zohar calls Ayn-Sof, i.e., the Infinite Himself, is in their
opinion, the totality of the Sefiroth, no more, no less, and each one of
the Sefiroth is but a different point of view of the same, thus
understood, Infinite. <span id="fr_284"></span>[27](#fn_285.md)

Between these two extremes enters a system much more profound and more
in accord with the spirit of the original Kabbalistic monuments, a
system which neither considers the Sefiroth as instruments, as
creatures, and, consequently, as beings distinct from God, nor is it
willing to identify them with God. Here is a summary of the ideas upon
which it rests: God is present in the Sefiroth, otherwise He could not
reveal Himself through them; but He does not dwell in them in His
eternity; He is more than what is found in the sublime forms of thought
and of existence. In fact, the Sefiroth can never comprise the Ayn-Sof
which is the very source of every form, and which, in

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

this capacity, has no form; or, to use the ordinary expression, while
each one of the Sefiroth has a well known name, the Infinite alone has
not and can not have any name. God remains, therefore, the Ineffable,
the Incomprehensible, the Infinite Being, high above all the worlds that
reveal to us His presence, even the world of Emanation.

By this reasoning they believe to escape the reproach of disregarding
the divine immutability. For the ten Sefiroth may be compared to ten
vessels of different forms, or to glasses of different colors. Whatever
vessel we wish to measure with the absolute essence of things it remains
always the same; and the divine light, like the light of the sun, does
not change its nature with the medium through which it passes. Let us
add that these vessels and these mediums have in themselves no positive
reality; they have no existence of their own; they simply represent the
limits within which the supreme essence of things has confined itself,
the different degrees of obscurity with which the divine light desired
to veil its infinite brightness, so it may be viewed. Whence the desire
to recognize in the Sefiroth two elements, or rather, two different
aspects: one, purely external and negative, representing the body, the
so-called vessel (‏כלי‎--Kalee); the other internal, positive, which
represents the spirit and the light.

Thus they could speak of broken vessels <span
id="fr_286"></span>[28](#fn_286.md) which let the divine light escape. This
point of view adopted by Isaac Luria, <span
id="fr_287"></span>[29](#fn_287.md) as well as by Moses Cordovera, <span
id="fr_288"></span>[30](#fn_288.md) and presented with much logic and
precision by the latter, is the one, to say it again, which we

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

regard as the most exact historically, and we shall rest thenceforth
upon it with entire confidence as the basis of all the metaphysical

part of the Kabbalah. Having established this general principle on the
authority of the texts and of the most valued commentaries, we must
indicate now the particular role of every Sefiroh and the different
manners of the grouping of all the Sefiroth by trinities and by persons.

The first of the highest of all the divine manifestations, in a word,
the first Sefiroh, is the Crown ‏כתר‎ (Kether), so named by the very
reason of the place assigned to it above all the others. "It is," says
the text, "the principle of all principles, the mysterious wisdom, the
highest of all crowns with which all diadems and crowns are
adorned." <span id="fr_289"></span>[31](#fn_289.md) It is not the confused
totality, formless, nameless; that mysterious unknown that preceded all
things, even the attributes; that ‏אין סף‎ (Ayn Sof). It represents the
Infinite as distinguished from the finite; its name in Holy Writ
signifies I Am, ‏אהיה‎ (Ay-Yeh), because it is the absolute being; the
being considered from a point of view where analysis cannot penetrate,
where qualifications are not possible, but where they are all united in
the indivisible point.

On that ground the first Sefiroh is also called the "primitive point,"
or simply the "point, ‏נקודה ראשונה‎ (N’kudoh R’shonoh) or ‏נקודה פשוטה‎
(N’kudoh P’shutoh). "When the Unknown of the Unknown wished to manifest
Himself, He first produced one point;" <span
id="fr_290"></span>[32](#fn_290.md) as long as this luminous point did not
depart from His bosom, the Infinite was as yet completely unknown, and
shed no light at all. <span id="fr_291"></span>[33](#fn_291.md) It is that
which the later Kabbalists have explained as an absolute concentration
of God in His own substance, ‏צמצום‎ (Tsimtsum). It is this
concentration which has brought forth space, the primitive air ‏אויר
קדמון‎ (Ahveer Kadmon), which is

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

not a true void, but a certain degree of light inferior to the creation.
But for the very reason that God retired within Himself, He is distinct
from all that is finite, <span id="fr_292"></span>[34](#fn_292.md) limited
and determined, and for the very reason that it can not be told yet what
He is, He is designated by a word which signifies: Naught, No-Thing,
Non-Being, ‏אין‎ (Ayn).

"They name Him thus," says the Idra Zutah, "because we do not know, and
because it can not be known what was in that principle (beginning);
because it is unattainable for our limitations, yes, even for
wisdom." <span id="fr_293"></span>[35](#fn_293.md), <span
id="fr_294"></span>[36](#fn_294.md) We must remark that we find again the
same idea, even the same expression, in one of the greatest and most
famous systems of metaphysics of which our epoch can boast to posterity.
"Everything begins," says Hegel, "*by the pure state of being*, a wholly
indeterminate, simple and immediate thought, for the true beginning can
be nothing else. . . But that pure being is only the purest abstraction;
it is an absolute negative term which may be called the
*non-existent* <span id="fr_295"></span>[37](#fn_295.md) if conceived in an
immediate manner."

Finally, to return to our Kabbalists, the mere idea of being, or of the
Absolute, considered from the point of view which we take, constituted a
complete form, or to use the usual term, a head, a face; they call it
the white head ‏רישא חוורא‎--Reeshoh Havroh, because all colors, that is
to say, all ideas, all determined modes are blended in that form, or the
"Ancient" (‏עתיקא‎--Ahteekah), because it is the first of the Sefiroth.
But, in the last case, we must take care not to confound it with the
"Ancient

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

of Ancients (Ahteekah D’ahteekin--‏עתיקא דעתקין‎), that is to say, with
the Ayn-Sof Himself, before whom the most dazzling light is but a
shadow. But it is most generally designated with the singular name of
"long face" ‏אריך אנפין‎ (Ahrich Anfin), undoubtedly because it contains
all the other qualifications and all the intellectual and moral
attributes of which, by the same reasoning, the "small face" is formed
‏זעיר אנפין‎ (Z’ere Anfin). <span id="fr_296"></span>[38](#fn_296.md)

"The first," says the text, "is the Ancient, seen face to face. It is
the supreme head, the source of all light, the principle of all wisdom,
and can be defined only by unity." <span
id="fr_297"></span>[39](#fn_297.md)

From the bosom of this absolute Unity, distinct from the various forms
and from all relative unity, go forth, as parallels, two principles,
opposite in appearance but inseparable in reality; one, male or active,
which is called "Wisdom," ‏חכמה‎ (Chachmah), the other passive, or
female, is designated by a word which it is customary to translate by
"Intelligence" ‏בינה‎ (Beenah). "All that exists," says the text, "all
that has been formed by the Ancient (Whose name be sanctified!), can
exist only by a male and a female." <span
id="fr_298"></span>[40](#fn_298.md) We shall not insist upon this general
form which we shall meet frequently as we proceed; we believe, though,
that in this instance it applies to the subject and to the object of
intelligence which was not possible to express more clearly in an
eminently poetical language.

Wisdom is also named the "father"; for it is said, Wisdom engenders all
things. By means of thirty-two marvellous ways by which it is diffused
through the universe, it imposes a form and measure on all that
is. <span id="fr_299"></span>[41](#fn_299.md) Intelligence is the "mother,"
as is written: Thou shalt call intelligence by the name of mother

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Prov. II,
3). <span id="fr_300"></span>[42](#fn_300.md) Without destroying the
antithesis established as the general condition of existence, they,
nevertheless, cause often the female or passive principle to spring
forth from the male principle. <span id="fr_301"></span>[43](#fn_301.md)
From their mysterious and eternal union comes forth a son, who according
to the original expression, takes at one and the same time the features
of his father and of his mother, bearing witness to both of them. This
son of Wisdom and Intelligence, called also, because of double
inheritance, the "first-born" is Knowledge or Science, ‏דעת‎ (Da-ath).

These three persons contain and unite all that was, is and will be; but
they are, in their turn, reunited in the white head, in the Ancient of
Ancients, for *all* is He, and *He* is all and in all. <span
id="fr_302"></span>[44](#fn_302.md) At times he is represented with three
heads which form but one head, and at times he is compared to the brain
which, without losing its unity, is divided into three parts, and by
means of thirty-two pairs of nerves spreads into the entire body, as
Divinity spreads into the universe by means of the thirty-two ways of
wisdom. "The Ancient (Whose name be sanctified!) exists with three heads
which form but one head only, and that head is the most exalted among
the most exalted things. And because the Ancient (Whose name be
blessed!) is represented by the number three (‏ובנין דעתיקא קדישא אתרשם
בתלת‎), all the other lights (the other Sefiroth) which receive light
from Him, are also comprised in the number three." <span
id="fr_303"></span>[45](#fn_303.md)

In the following passage the terms of that trinity are somewhat
different; we see there the Ayn-Sof himself, but, on the other hand, we
do not find there "Intelligence," no doubt because it is but a reflex, a
certain expansion or dimension of the Logos which is

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

called here "Wisdom." "There are three heads sculptured one in the
other, and one above the other. One head is the secret, hidden wisdom
which is never unveiled. The mysterious wisdom is the supreme principle
of all other wisdom. Above that first head is the Ancient (Whose name be
sanctified!), the most mysterious of all the mysteries. Finally, comes
the head which dominates all the other heads, a head which is not a
head. No one knows nor can know what that head contains, for it joins
neither science nor our understanding. Because of that, the Ancient
(Whose name be sanctified!) is called the No-Thing
(‏אין‎--Eye-in)" <span id="fr_304"></span>[46](#fn_304.md) Thus, unity in
being, and trinity in intellectual manifestations or in thought--this is
the exact summing up of what we have just said.

Sometimes the terms, or, if we wish, the persons of this trinity, are
represented as three successive and absolutely necessary phases in
existence as well as in thought, or to use an expression accepted in
Germany, as a logical process showing at the same time the generation of
the world. Whatever astonishment that fact may excite, it will not be
doubted when the following lines have been read: "Come and see that
thought is the principle of all that is; as such it is at first ignored
and confined within itself. When thought begins to diffuse, it arrives
at the degree where it becomes spirit; <span
id="fr_305"></span>[47](#fn_305.md) arrived at that point, it takes the
name of intelligence, and is not, as before, confined within itself. The
spirit or mind itself develops from the very bosom of the mysteries by
which it

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

is surrounded, and a voice goes forth which is the union of all the
heavenly choirs; a voice that speaks distinctly and in articulate words;
for it comes from the spirit. But in reflecting upon all these degrees,
you will find that the thought, the intelligence, this voice and this
word are one and the same thing; that the thought is the beginning of
all that is, and that there can be no interruption in it. True thought
is bound to Naught (‏אין‎--Eye-in), and is never parted from it. That is
the meaning of the words: Jehovah is One and His name is One." <span
id="fr_306"></span>[48](#fn_306.md)

Here is another passage where the same idea is easily recognized under a
more original and, as it seems to us, a more ancient form: "The name
which signifies I Am ‏אהיה‎ (A-yeh), shows the union of all that is, the
degree where all the ways of wisdom are as yet hidden and united at one
place, and can as yet not be distinguished one from another. But when a
line of demarkation is established, when it is intended to designate the
mother bearing in her bosom all things and about to bring them forth in
order to reveal the supreme name, then, speaking of Himself, God says: I
Who ‏אשר אהיה‎ (Asher A-yeh). <span id="fr_307"></span>[49](#fn_307.md)
Finally, when all has been well formed and has departed from the
maternal bosom, when everything is in its place, and when it is intended
to designate the particular as well as the existence, God calls Himself
Jehovah, or, I Am that I Am, ‏אהיה אשר אהיה‎ (A-yeh asher A-yeh). These
are the mysteries of the holy name revealed to Moses, and of which no
other man shared the knowledge with him." <span
id="fr_308"></span>[50](#fn_308.md)

The system of the Kabbalah does not, therefore, rest solely on the
principle of emanation or upon the unity of substance.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> As we see, the
Kabbalists went further. They taught a doctrine very similar to the
doctrine which the metaphysicians of Germany now regard as the greatest
glory of our time. They, the Kabbalists, believed in the absolute
identity of thought and of existence; and consequently, the world, as we
shall see later, could be to them nothing else than the expression of
ideas, or of absolute forms of intelligence; in short, they give us a
glimpse into the union of Plato and Spinoza. To clear this important
fact of all doubt, and to show at the same time that the most learned of
the modern Kabbalists have remained true to the traditions of their
predecessors, we will add to the texts we have translated from the Zohar
a very remarkable passage from the commentaries of Cordovera:

"The three first Sefiroth, to wit: the Crown, Wisdom and Intelligence,
should be regarded as one and the same thing. The first represents
knowledge or science, the second represents the knower, and the third
represents the known. To explain this identity we must know that the
knowledge of the Creator is not like the knowledge of the created, for
with the latter knowledge is distinct from the subject of knowledge, and
bears upon objects which, in their turn, are distinct from the subject.
This is designated by the following three terms: the thought, that which
thinks, and the thing thought of. The Creator, on the other hand, is in
Himself the knowledge, the knower and the known. In fact, His manner of
knowing does not consist in applying His thought to things outside of
Him, for it is by understanding and knowing Himself that He knows and
perceives all that is. Nothing exists that is not one with Him and that
He does not find in His own substance. He is the type (--typus) of all
being, and all things exist in Him under their purest and most
accomplished forms; so that the perfection of the creatures is inherent
in this very existence by which they were united to the source of their
being, <span id="fr_309"></span>[51](#fn_309.md) and in measure as they
recede from that source,

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

they fall away from that perfect and sublime state. It is thus that all
sorts of existence in this world have their form in the Sefiroth, and
the Sefiroth have their form in the source from which they
emanate." <span id="fr_310"></span>[52](#fn_310.md)

The seven attributes which we still have to speak of, and which are
called by the modern Kabbalists the Sefiroth of the Construction
(‏ספירות הבנין‎--Sefiroth Habinyon), undoubtedly because they are of
more immediate service for the edification of the world, develop, like
the preceding attributes, in the form of trinities, in each one of which
two extremes are united by a middle term. <span
id="fr_311"></span>[53](#fn_311.md) From the bosom of divine thought, which
alone attained its fullest manifestation, proceed first two opposite
principles, one active or male, the other female or passive.

In "grace" or "mercy," ‏חסד‎ (Hessed) we find the principle of the
first, the second is represented by "judgment, ‏דין‎ (Din)." <span
id="fr_312"></span>[54](#fn_312.md) But it is easily seen from the part
held by the two principles in the whole of the system, that this grace
and this judgment are not to be taken literally; we treat here of what
we could call the expansion and the contraction of the will. In fact, it
is from the first one that the male souls spring, and from the second
spring the female souls. These two attributes are called also the "two
arms of God"; one gives life, the other gives death. Were they separated
the world could not subsist; it is even impossible for them to act
separately, for according to the original expression, there is no
judgment without mercy; <span id="fr_313"></span>[55](#fn_313.md) they also
combine in a

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

common centre "Beauty" <span id="fr_314"></span>[56](#fn_314.md) whose
gross symbol is the breast or the heart. <span
id="fr_315"></span>[57](#fn_315.md)

It is remarkable that the beautiful is considered here as the expression
and as the result of all moral qualities, or as the sum of all that is
good. But the three following attributes are purely dynamic, that is to
say, they represent the Deity as the Cause, as the universal force, as
the generative principle of all beings. The first two, which represent
in this new sphere, the male and the female principle, are called,
conformably to a text of the Holy Scriptures, "Triumph" ‏נצח‎ (Netsach),
and "Glory," ‏הוד‎ (Hode). It would be difficult to find the meaning of
the two words were they not followed by this definition: "By the words
'Triumph' and 'Glory' we understand extension, <span
id="fr_316"></span>[58](#fn_317.md) multiplication and force; for all the
forces that spring up in the universe start from their bosom, and for
this reason these two Sefiroth are called the hosts of the
Eternal." <span id="fr_317"></span>[59](#fn_318.md)

They united in a common principle, ordinarily represented by the organs
of generation which can not denote anything but the generative element,
or the source, the root of all that is. For this reason it is called the
"foundation" or basis, ‏יסוד‎ (Y’sod). "All things," reads the text,
"will re-enter the basis from which they issued forth. All the marrow,
all the sap, all the power is gathered in that place. All existing
forces issue from it by the organ of generation." These three attributes
also form but one single face, one single aspect of the divine nature,
represented in the Bible by the "God of Hosts." <span
id="fr_318"></span>[60](#fn_319.md) As to the last of the Sefiroth,

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

or "Kingdom, ‏מלכות‎ (Malkuth)," all Kabbalists agree that it does not
express any new attribute; but simply the harmony which exists between
all the other attributes and their absolute rule over the world.

Thus the ten Sefiroth which, in their entirety, form the Heavenly or
Ideal Man, called by the modern Kabbalists the "world of emanation,"
‏עולם אצילות‎ (Olam Atzilus), is divided into three classes, each one of
which shows us the deity in a different aspect, but always in the form
of an indivisible trinity. The first three Sefiroth are purely
intellectual or metaphysical. They express the absolute identity of
existence and thought, and form, what modern Kabbalists have called, the
"intelligible world," ‏עולם מושכל‎ (Olam Muskol). The three Sefiroth
following have a moral character; on the one hand they make us conceive
God as the identity of kindness and wisdom, on the other hand they show
us that the source of beauty and magnificence is in kindness or rather
in the supreme good. They have therefore been named the "virtues,"
‏מדות‎ (Midoth), or the "world of feeling," ‏עולם מורגש‎ (Olam Murgosh),
in the loftiest meaning of the word. Finally, we learn by the last of
these attributes that the universal providence, the supreme architect,
is also the absolute force, the all-powerful cause, and that this cause
is at the same time the generating element of all that is. These last
Sefiroth constitute the "natural world," or nature in its essence and in
its principle, natura naturans, ‏עולם המוטבע‎ (Olam Hamutbah). <span
id="fr_320"></span>[61](#fn_320.md)

How and in what terms these different aspects are brought back to unity,
and consequently to a supreme trinity, the following passage will show:
"In order to acquire the knowledge of a holy unity, we must examine the
flame which rises from a fire-place or from a lighted lamp; we see then,
at first, two kinds of light, a glistening white one and a black or blue
one; the white light is above and rises in a straight line, the black or
blue light is

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

beneath, and appears to be the seat of the first; yet the two lights are
so closely united that they form one single flame only. But the seat
formed by the blue or black light is, in its turn, attached to the wick
which is still under it. The white light never changes, it always
remains white; but several shades are distinguished in the lower light.
The lower light takes, moreover, two opposite directions; above it is
attached to the white light, and below it is attached to the burning
matter, but this matter continually consumes itself, and constantly
rises towards the upper light. It is thus that all that is joins again
to the one unity, ‏וכלא אתקשר ביחודה אחד‎." <span
id="fr_321"></span>[62](#fn_321.md) To dispel all doubt as to the meaning
of this allegory, we may add that is it found, almost literally
reproduced, in another part <span id="fr_322"></span>[63](#fn_322.md) of
the Zohar, to explain the nature of the human soul which also forms a
trinity, a feeble image of the supreme trinity.

This last species of trinity which explicitly comprises all the others,
and which sums up the entire theory of the Sefiroth, plays also the most
important part in the Zohar. Like the preceding trinities, it is
represented by three terms only, each one of which has already been
represented as the highest manifestation of one of the lower trinities.
Among the metaphysical attributes it is the "Crown;" among the moral
attributes it is "Beauty;" among the inferior attributes it is
"Kingdom." But what is meant by the "Crown" in the allegorical language
of the Kabbalists? It is the substance, the one and absolute being. What
is "Beauty?" It is, as the Idra Zuta expressly says, "the highest
expression of moral life and of moral perfection." As an emanation from
intelligence and mercy, it is often compared to the orient, to the sun
whose light is reflected equally by all earthly objects, and without
which all would return to darkness; in a word it is the ideal.

Finally, what is "Kingdom?" It is the permanent and imminent

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

action of all the Sefiroth combined, the actual presence of God in the
creation. This idea is fully expressed by the word Shekinah (‏שכינה‎),
one of the surnames of the "Kingdom." The true terms of this new trinity
are, accordingly, the absolute, the ideal and the immanent face; or
also, the substance, the thought and the life; that is, the uniting of
the thought with the object. They constitute what is called "the middle
column" ‏עמודא דאמצעיתא‎ (Amudah D’amtzissoh), because in all the
figures customarily used to represent the Sefiroth they are placed in
the centre, one above another, in the form of a vertical line or column.
As may be expected of what we already know, these three terms also
become so many "faces" or symbolical manifestations. The "Crown" does
not change its name, it is always the "long face," the "Ancient of
days," "the Ancient Whose name be sanctified"; ‏עתיקא קדישא‎ (Ateekah
K’deeshah). "Beauty" is the "holy king," or simply the "King" ‏מלכא‎
(Malko), ‏מלכא קדישא,‎ (Malko K’deeshah), and the "Shekinah," the divine
presence in things, is the "Matrona," or "Queen" ‏מטרוניתא‎
(Matrooneitha) .

When the one is compared to the sun, the other is compared to the moon;
because the moon borrows all the light by which it shines from a higher
place, from a degree immediately above her. In other words, real
existence is only a reflection or image of ideal beauty. The "Matrona"
is also called "Eve," "for," says the text, "Eve is the mother of all
things, and everything that exists here below, nurses from her breast
and is blessed through her." <span id="fr_323"></span>[64](#fn_323.md) The
"King" and the "Queen," commonly called also the "two faces" ‏דו
פרצופין‎ (Doo Partsufin), <span id="fr_324"></span>[65](#fn_324.md) form
together a pair whose task is to pour forth constantly upon the world
new grace, and through their union to continue the work of the creation,
or, what is more, to perpetuate the work of the creation.

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But the mutual
love which impels them to this work, bursts forth in two ways, and
produces consequently fruits of two kinds.

Sometimes it comes from above, going from the husband to the wife, and
from there to the entire universe; that is to say, existence and life,
starting from the depths of the intelligible world, tend to multiply
more and more in the objects of nature. Sometimes, on the contrary, it
comes from below, going from the wife to the husband, from the real
world to the ideal world, from earth to heaven, and brings back to the
bosom of God the beings capable of demanding their return.

The Zohar itself offers us an example of these two modes of generation
in the circular course run by the holy souls. The soul, considered in
its purest essence, has its root in intelligence, I mean the Supreme
intelligence where the forms of the beings begin to differentiate
themselves one from another, and which is really the universal soul.
From there it passes, if it is to be a male soul, by the principle of
grace or expansion; if it is to be a female soul, it impregnates itself
with the principle of judgment or concentration. Finally, it is brought
forth into the world where we live by the union of the King and the
Queen, "who," as the text reads, "are to the generation of the soul,
what man and woman are to the physical generation--the generation of the
body." <span id="fr_325"></span>[66](#fn_325.md) By this road the soul
descends to earth.

Now, here is the way the soul returns to the bosom of God: When adorned
with all the virtues, it has fulfilled its mission and is mature for
heaven, it rises of its own impulse, by the love it inspires as well as
by the love it experiences, and with it rises also the last degree of
emanation or real existence, which is thus brought in harmony with the
ideal form. The King and the Queen unite anew, impelled by another cause
and for another purpose than the first one. <span
id="fr_326"></span>[67](#fn_326.md) "In this manner," says the Zohar,

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "life is drawn
simultaneously from above and from below. The source is renewed and the
sea, always refilled, distributes its waters to every place." <span
id="fr_327"></span>[68](#fn_327.md)

The union may take place accidentally while the soul is still chained to
the body. But there we touch upon ecstasy, mystic rapture and the dogma
of reversibility, of which we have decided to speak elsewhere.

We believe, however, that our exposition of the Sefiroth would be
incomplete without the mention of the figures which have been used to
depict them to the eye. There are three principal figures, of which two
at least are sanctioned by the Zohar. One shows the Sefiroth in the form
of ten concentric circles, or rather of nine circles traced around a
point which is their common centre. The other represents the Sefiroth as
the human body. The "crown" is the head; "wisdom" the brain;
"intelligence" the heart; the trunk and the breast, in short, the middle
column, is the symbol of "beauty"; the arms are the symbols of "grace"
and "judgment"; the lower parts of the body express the remaining
attributes.

It is upon these wholly arbitrary tales, carried to their last
exaggeration in the "Tikkunim" (the supplements to the Zohar), that the
practical Kabbalah and the claim to combat bodily ills with the
different names of God <span id="fr_328"></span>[69](#fn_328.md) are mostly
founded. Besides, this is not the first time that ideas have been
gradually smothered even by the grossest symbols, and thoughts replaced
by forms at the decadence of a doctrine. Finally, the last manner of
representing the ten Sefiroth is to divide them into three groups. To
the right, on a vertical line, we see represented the attributes which
may be called expansive; namely: the Logos or Wisdom, Mercy and
Strength; <span id="fr_329"></span>[70](#fn_329.md) to the left we find
placed in the same

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

manner, on a parallel line, those which designate resistance or
concentration: Intelligence, i.e., the consciousness of the Logos,

Judgment and so-called resistance. In the centre finally are the
substantial attributes which we have included in the supreme trinity. At
the top, above the common level, we read the name of the crown, and at
the base we read the name of kingdom. <span
id="fr_331"></span>[71](#fn_331.md)

The Zohar often alludes to this figure, which it compares to a tree of
which the Ayn-Sof is its life and sap, and which was later called the
"Kabbalistic tree." At each step we are reminded there of the "column of
mercy" (‏עמודא דחסד‎--Amoodah D’hessed, ‏סטרא ימינא‎--Sitra
Y’meenah--the "right column"), of the "column of judgment" (‏עמודא
דדינא‎--Amoodah D’dinah, ‏סטרא דאמלא‎--Sitra D’smolah--"the left
column") and of the "centre column" (‏עמודא דאמציעתא‎--Amoodah
D’amtsee-othoh). This does not prevent this same diagram from
representing to us, in another plan, by horizontal lines, the three
secondary trinities of which we have previously spoken. Besides these
diagrams, modern Kabbalists have conceived also "canals"
(‏צנורות‎--Tsnooroth) which indicate in a material form all possible
relations and combinations between the Sefiroth. Moses Cordovera tells
of an author who could make six hundred thousand of such combinations.
These subtleties may interest to a certain degree the science of
calculus, but we search there in vain for a metaphysical idea.

A strange idea, in a still stranger form, mingles in the Zohar with the
doctrine of the Sefiroth which we have just explained. It is the idea of
a fall and a rehabilitation, even in the sphere of

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

the divine attributes; of a creation that failed because God did not
descend with it to dwell in it; because He has yet not assumed that
intermediary form between Himself and the creature of which man here
below is the most perfect expression. These, apparently different
conceptions, have been united into a single thought which is found, now
more developed, now less developed, in the Book of Mystery in the two
Idras and in some fragments of less importance. It is presented in the
following strange manner: in the Book of Genesis <span
id="fr_332"></span>[72](#fn_332.md) mention is made of seven kings of Edom
who preceded the kings of Israel, and enumerating them it mentions their
successive deaths to show the order in which they succeeded one another.
The authors of the Zohar took hold of this text, which in itself is
foreign to such an order of ideas, to fasten to it their belief in a
kind of revolution in the invisible world of the divine emanation. By
the "kings of Israel" they understand the two forms of absolute
existence which are personified in the "King" and the "Queen," who, by
dividing absolute existence for the sake of our feeble intelligence,
represent the true essence of being. The "Kings of Edom" or, as they are
also called, the "ancient kings," are worlds which could neither subsist
nor be realized before those forms were established which serve as
intermediaries between the creation and the divine essence as considered
in its entire purity.

However, we believe that the better way of expounding without impairing
this obscure portion of the system, would be to cite some fragments that
refer to it and which explain themselves reciprocally. "Before the
Ancient of Ancients, the most hidden among the hidden, had prepared the
forms of the kings and the first diadems, there was neither limitation
nor end. He, therefore, took to sculpturing and tracing these forms in
His own substance. He stretched before Him a veil, and in that veil He
sculptured the kings, and traced their limits and their forms; but they
could not subsist. Therefore it is written: these are the kings that
reigned in

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

the land of Edom before a king reigned over the children of Israel. Here
are dealt with the primitive kings and primitive Israel. <span
id="fr_333"></span>[73](#fn_333.md) All the kings thus formed had their
names, but they could not subsist until He (the Ancient) descended to
them and veiled Himself for them." <span
id="fr_334"></span>[74](#fn_334.md)

There can be no doubt that these lines refer to a creation which
anteceded ours, and to worlds that preceded ours. The Zohar itself tells
us so in the most positive terms further on, <span
id="fr_335"></span>[75](#fn_335.md) and this is also the unanimous belief
of all the modern Kabbalists. But why did the ancient worlds disappear?
Because God did not dwell in their midst regularly and constantly, or,
as the text reads, because God had not come down to them; because He had
as yet not shown Himself in a form that permitted Him to be present in
the creation, and to perpetuate it by this very union. The worlds which
He then produced by a spontaneous emanation from His own substance, are
compared to sparks which escape in disorder from a common hearth and
which die out in proportion to their distance from it. "Ancient worlds
there were which had been destroyed, formless worlds which have been
called "sparks" (‏זיקין עולם ניצוצין‎); for thus it is when striking the
iron the blacksmith causes sparks to burst forth on all sides. These
sparks are the ancient worlds, and these worlds were destroyed and could
not exist because the Ancient (Whose name be sanctified!) has as yet not
assumed His form, and the workman was not as yet at his work." <span
id="fr_336"></span>[76](#fn_336.md)

Now then, what is that form without which neither duration nor
organization in the finite beings is possible, which, properly speaking,
represents the artisan in the divine works, and by

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

which, finally, God communicates, and in some sort reproduces Himself
outside of Himself? It is the human form conceived in its highest
generality, which comprises the moral and intellectual attributes of our
nature as well as the conditions of its development and perpetuation, in
a word, sexual differentiation, which the Zohar admits for the soul as
well as for the body. This conception of sexual differentiation, or
rather, the division and reproduction of the human form, is to them the
symbol of universal life, of a regular and infinite development of
existence, of a regular and continuous creation not alone through
duration, but also through successive realization of all the possible
forms of existence.

We have met before with the root of this idea; but here is something
more. The gradual expansion of life, existence, and of divine thought
did not begin immediately below the substance; it was preceded by that
[tumultuous](errata.htm#15.md) disorderly and, if I may say, inorganic
emanation of which we have just spoken. "Why were the old worlds
destroyed? Because man was not yet formed. The form of man contains all
things, and all things can be maintained by it. As this form did not
exist yet, the worlds that preceded it could neither subsist nor
maintain themselves. They fell in ruins, until the form of man was
established. They were then reborn with it, but under other
names." <span id="fr_337"></span>[77](#fn_337.md)

We do not wish to prove by new passages the sexual distinction either in
the ideal man or in the divine attributes; we only wish to note here
that this distinction, which is repeated under so many different forms
in the Zohar, is also given the characteristic name of the balance
(‏מתקלא‎--Maskaloh). "Before the balance was established," says the Book
of Mystery, "they (the King and the Queen, the ideal world and the real
world) did not see one another face to face, the first kings died
because they could find no subsistence, and the earth was ruined . . .
the balance is suspended in a place that is not (the primitive naught);
they who

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

were to be weighed do not exist as yet. It is an entirely inward balance
that has no other support but itself, and it is invisible. This balance
carries and will carry everything that is not, that is and will
be." <span id="fr_338"></span>[78](#fn_338.md)

The previous citation taught us that the kings of Edom, the ancient
worlds, did not entirely disappear. For in the Kabbalistic system
nothing comes into existence and nothing perishes in an absolute manner.
They only lost their place, which was the actual universe; and when God
stepped out of Himself to show Himself again in the form of Man, they
were resuscitated, came to life again, in some sort, to enter under
other names into the general system of the creation. "When it is said
'the kings of Edom are dead,' it is not meant that they really died, or
that they were totally destroyed; for every sinking down from a previous
degree is called death." <span id="fr_339"></span>[79](#fn_339.md) They
really did sink quite low, or rather they rose but little above the
nihility; for they were placed on the last step of the universe. They
represent the purely passive existence, or, to use the expression of the
Zohar, judgment without mercy, a place where all is
[sternness](errata.htm#16.md) and judgment (‏באתר דדינן מתאחדין
תמן‎), <span id="fr_340"></span>[80](#fn_340.md) or where all is feminine
without any masculine principle (‏אתר דנקבא‎), that is, a place where
everything is resistance and inertia as in matter.

For that reason also they were called the Kings of Edom, because Edom
was the opposite of Israel who represents mercy, life, spiritual and
active existence. Taking most of these expressions literally, we may say
with the modern Kabbalists, that the ancient worlds became a place of
chastisement for crime, and that from their ruins came forth those
malevolent beings who serve as instruments for divine justice. The idea
would remain unchanged thereby, for, as we may convince ourselves
further on, the punishment of guilty souls consists, according to the
Zohar,

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

where metempsychosis plays such a great part, precisely in a rebirth
into the lowest degree of the creation, and in submitting more and more
to the bondage of matter.

As to the demons, who are always called by the significant name of the
"shells" (‏קליפּות‎--Klippoth), <span id="fr_341"></span>[81](#fn_341.md)
they are nothing more than matter itself, and the passions that depend
on it. Thus, every form of existence, from matter to eternal wisdom, is
a manifestation, or rather, an emanation of the Infinite Being. That all
things may have reality and continuance, it is not sufficient for them
to come from God; it is also necessary that God be in their midst at all
times, that He live, expand and reappear eternally and infinitely in
their own appearance; for should He choose to leave them to themselves,
they would vanish like a shadow. Better still! this shadow is a part of
the chain of divine manifestations; it is the shadow which is the
matter, it is the shadow that marks the boundary where life and spirit
disappear from our sight. It is the end, as ideal man is the beginning.
Upon this principle, then, the Kabbalistic cosmology and psychology are
founded.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_257"></span>[145:1](rph15.htm#fr_257.md) These two words
signify the "Great Assembly," because the fragment bearing this title
comprises the discourses held by Simeon ben Yohai amidst all his
disciples assembled to the number of ten. At a later time when death had
reduced them to the number of seven, they formed the "Little Assembly"
(‏אדרא זוטא‎--Idra Zutah) to which ben Yohai spoke before he died.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[146:2](rph15.htm#fr_258.md) In the text: ‏יומין
זעירין ומארי׳ דהובא דהיק כרוזא מארי כל יומא זמהצדי הקלא זעירין אינון.‎
Compare R. Tarfon's saying in Pirke Abot (Chapters of the Fathers) ‏היום
קצר והמלאכה מרובה והפוצלים עצלים ובעל הבית דוחק‎ "The day is short, the
work aplenty, the laborers are lazy and the master urges."--Jellinek.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[146:3](rph15.htm#fr_259.md) The passage: ‏פתח
ואמר (ר׳ שמעון בן יוחאי) ארור האיש אשר יעשה פסל ומסכה מעשי ידי חרש ושם
בסתר וענו כל העם ואמדו אמן.‎ "(R. Simeon ben Yohai) opened (the
discourse) and said: Cursed be the man who maketh a graven or molten
image, the abomination of the Lord, the work of the hands of the
craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place; and all the people shall
answer, and say, Amen (Deut. XXVII, 15)," points out very clearly that
the description of God was not to be taken in a material way.--Jellinek.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[146:4](rph15.htm#fr_260.md) According to Daniel
V, 6. ‏וארכובתן דא לדא נקשן‎--and his knees knocked one against the
other.--Jellinek.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[147:5](rph15.htm#fr_261.md) I can not find any
other meaning in the two words: ‏בוצינא דאנפוי‎

<span id="fn_262"></span>[147:6](rph15.htm#fr_262.md) The French text has:
"Quatre cent mille mondes né de cette blanche lumière."--; Four hundred
thousand worlds begotten by this white light. This translation of the
original text is incorrect, and is based upon a misconception of the
haphazard punctuation of the Zohar. The author has read together ‏לעלמז
דאתי‎ with the following ‏די מאה עלמין‎, which is really the beginning
of a new sentence, and is an introduction to the explanatory phrase
‏הה״ד‎--Transl.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[147:7](rph15.htm#fr_263.md) The adepts of the
Kabbalah are so called.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[147:8](rph15.htm#fr_264.md) This "long" or "great
face" is nothing else, as we shall soon see, but the divine substance,
the first Sefiroh.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[148:9](rph15.htm#fr_265.md) Zohar, part III, fol.
129a and b. The description of the beard and of the hair alone takes up
a considerable place in the Idra Rabba.

Talmud, tract. Haggiga 15. Bereshith Rabba, 8.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[150:11](rph15.htm#fr_267.md) Ordinarily
"Foundation" (‏יסוד‎--Y’sod) is taken as the one before the last and
"Kingdom" (‏מלכות‎--Malchus) as the last Sefiroh. <span
id="fr_269"></span>[a](#fn_268.md)--Jellinek.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[150:a](rph15.htm#fr_269.md) And it is so given in
the original text of the Zohar. The author is also mistaken in
translating the last Sefiroh ‏מלכות‎ (Malchus) with "royauté" (royalty).
He probably meant to render it by "royaumé" (kingdom) .--Transl.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[150:12](rph15.htm#fr_268.md) Zohar, part II, fol.
42b, 43a, sec. ‏בא אל פרעה.‎.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[151:13](rph15.htm#fr_270.md) Zohar, part I, fol.
1 and 2; part II, fol. 105a. In this text there is a play upon words
that can not be rendered faithfully. It is proposed to explain the
following verse: "Lift up your eyes toward the heavens and see who has
created these." (Isaiah, XL, 6). Now, by joining the two Hebrew words
‏מי‎ (Me--Who) and ‏אלה‎ (Ayleh--these), we get <span id="page_152">p.
152</span> the name of God ‏אלהים‎ (Elohim). The author of the verse
wished to designate the universe, and therefore it has been concluded
that the universe and God are inseparable, since both have one and the
same name.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[152:14](rph15.htm#fr_271.md) In the Zohar really

<span id="fn_279"></span>[154:22](rph15.htm#fr_279.md) But the sense of the

Maimonides' commentary on this Mishnah.--Jellinek.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[154:24](rph15.htm#fr_281.md) ‏פרצופין‎

broke.--Jellinek

<span id="fn_304"></span>[161:46](rph15.htm#fr_304.md) As I have digressed
here from both the original French text and the German translation in my
endeavor to keep to the text of the Zohar, I deem it my duty to give the
text as it is printed in the Zohar, part III, fol. 288a and b.

translated by Jellinek is more correct and has been followed here.
"Justice," as used by the author, would be (Tsedek). According to
Gesenius "Din" has the meaning of "to judge (and thus to reign)." I
would say that "Din" represents justice untempered by mercy.--Transl.

‏קליפּות‎ "Klippoth" is ‏קלף‎ (Kolauf or Kalof)--to pare, unshell, peel.
I have therefore chosen "shells" as the most appropriate. The author's
rendition of this word by "envelopes"--wrapper, cover, envelope,
casing--does not seem to me to be correct etymologically, at least. Dr.
Jellinek translates it by "Schalen," and gives the Latin word "cortices"
as explanatory.--Transl.
