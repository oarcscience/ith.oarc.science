### FOREWORD TO THE SECOND FRENCH EDITION

FRANCK

It is almost half a century, in 1843, since this book saw the light for
the first time. It is nearly as long since it was introduced into public
and private libraries. This public eagerness to take notice of a
metaphysical and religious work could but astonish us; it is explainable
by the subject covered therein and by the very name of the Kabbalah.
Since that time, long past, I have often been requested, in and out of
France, to publish a second edition of my volume of 1843. For several
reasons I refused to satisfy this desire. Compelled by circumstances, as
professor of physical and international law, at the College of France,
to devote all my activity to studies which are of general interest, it
was difficult for me to return to a subject of research which did not
seem to me to respond any more to the spirit of the times. Then again, I
would have been obliged, because of the nature of the objections raised,
to relegate to second place that which makes up the merit and charm of
the Kabbalah, that is to say, the philosophic and religious system it
contains, in order to discuss first certain bibliographical and
chronological questions. I lacked the courage and did not consider it
useful to impose upon myself this sacrifice.

The situation is quite different now. Disgusted with positivistic,
evolutionistic and brutally atheistic doctrines which dominate our
countries to-day, and which seek to domineer not alone science but
society as well, many minds have turned to the Orient, the cradle of
religions and the primitive fatherland of

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

mystic ideas; and among the doctrines which they endeavor to restore to
honor, the Kabbalah is not forgotten. I shall give several proofs.

We must know that under the name of the Theosophical Society, there
exists a vast organization which, coming from India, passed to America
and Europe, sending out vigorous ramifications into the United States,
England, and France. This association is not left to chance; it has its
hierarchy, its organization, its literature, its reviews and its
journals. The principal organ in France is the *Lotus*. This is a
periodical publication of very great interest, which borrowed from
Buddhism the foundation of ideas, making no pretense to bind to them the
minds by forbidding new researches and attempts at changes. Upon this
Buddhistic foundation are often developed speculations and textual
quotations borrowed from the Kabbalah.

There is even a branch of the Theosophic Society, a French branch by the
name of Isis, which published during the last year a previously
unpublished translation of the Sefer Yetzirah, one of the two
Kabbalistic books considered the oldest and most important. What gives
merit to this translation, or, above all, what makes valuable the
commentaries that accompany it, I do not consider it my duty to examine
here. I will only say, in order to give an idea of the thought that
inspired the author of this work, that, according to him, "the Kabbalah
is the only religion from which all other cults emanated." (Preface, p.
4.)

Another Review, also consecrated to theosophical propaganda, and in
which necessarily the Kabbalah occurs often is the one which was
founded, and which is managed and edited, for the most part, by Lady
Caithness, Duchess of Pomar. Its name is the same as the one given by
the great German theosophist Jacob Boehm to his first work--"The Dawn."
The purpose of the *Dawn* is not entirely the same as that of the
*Lotus*. Buddhism does not hold there first rank to the detriment of
Christianity; but with the aid of an esoteric interpretation of sacred
texts,

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

the two religions are brought in accord and presented as the common
source of all other religions. This esoteric interpretation is surely
one of the principal elements of the Kabbalah; but this also is made to
contribute in a direct manner, under the name of Semitic Theosophy. I do
not undertake to guarantee the correctness with which it is expounded. I
limit myself to point out the lively preoccupation of which it is the
object in the very curious work of the Duchess of Pomar.

Why not speak also of the Magazine *Initiation*, although it is no more
than four months in existence? The very name *Initiation* tells us a
great deal, it puts us upon the [threshold](errata.htm#1.md) of a good many
sanctuaries closed to the profane; and this young *Review*, which, in
fact, bears upon its cover the title "Philosophic and Independent Review
of the Higher Studies," is dedicated exclusively to science, or, at
least to matters of research, to subjects of curiosity and conjectures,
suspected most in the eyes of established science and even in the eyes
of that public opinion which passes as an organ of common sense. Among
these figure, in a general manner, Theosophy, Occult Sciences,
Hypnotism, Freemasonry, Alchemy, Astrology, Animal Magnetism,
Physiognomy, Spiritualism, etc., etc.

Wherever the subject of Theosophy springs up, one is sure to see the
Kabbalah appear. The *Initiation* does not fail to obey this law. The
Kabbalah, "the Sacred Kabbalah," as she calls it, is dear to her. She
appeals often to its authority; but one notices, particularly in its
second number, an article from the pen of Mr. René Caillé, on the
"Kingdom of God" by Albert Jouney, where the doctrine of the Zohar, the
most important of the two Kabbalistic works, serves as basis to a
Christian Kabbalah formed from the ideas of St. Martin, styled the
"Unknown Philosopher," the unconscious renovator of the doctrine of
Origenes. That which Abbot Roca proposes in one of the first numbers of
the *Lotus* is also a Christian Kabbalah.

I shall be permitted also not to pass entirely in silence the

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Swedenborgian
journals which appeared lately in and out of France, especially the
"General Philosophy of the Students of Swedenborg's Books." <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) But the Church of Swedenborg, or the "New
Jerusalem," although represented by its adepts as one of the most
important forms of Theosophy, can surely not join the Kabbalah simply
because it leans upon an esoteric interpretation of sacred books. The
results of this interpretation and the personal visions of the Swedish
prophet resemble but little, barring a few exceptions, the teachings
contained in the Kabbalistic books--the Zohar and the Sefer Yetzirah. I
shall rather stop to consider a recent work of great erudition, a
doctor's thesis presented not long ago to the Faculty of Sciences of
Paris, which did not receive the measure of attention of which it is
worthy: "Essay on Egyptian Gnosticism, its development and its Egyptian
origin," by M. E. Amélineau (Paris, 1887).

This dissertation, written for an entirely different purpose, demolishes
entirely the criticism which sees in the Kabbalah nothing but fraud
hatched in the head of some obscure rabbi of the thirteenth century and
continued after him by unintelligent and unscientific imitators.

Amélineau discovers for us in the fathers of gnosticism, who were
absolutely unknown in the thirteenth century, mainly in Saturninus and
Valentin, a system of theogony and of cosmogony identical to the one of
the Zohar; and not only are the ideas alike, but the symbolical form of
language and the manner of argumentation are also the same. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md)

In the same year in which Mr. Amélineau, by his doctor's thesis,
delivered at Sarbonne, avenged the Zohar from the attacks delivered
against it by the skepticism of our times, another German scholar, Mr.
Epstein, restored to the Sefer Yetzirah, also a target for the
objections of modern criticism, a part at least of its great antiquity.
Although he does not permit it to go back to Akkiba,

xxv

and still less to the patriarch Abraham, he establishes, at least,
through decisive reasoning, that it is not any later than the fourth
century of our era. <span id="fr_8"></span>[3](#fn_8.md)

This is something already. But I do not doubt, that by paying more
attention to the depth rather than the form of the book, and by
searching for analogies in the most ancient products of gnosticism, it
will be possible to go back still further. Do not numbers and letters to
which the entire system of the Sefer Yetzirah is traceable, play just as
great a role in Pythagorism as in the first system of India? It is the
rage nowadays to rejuvenate everything, as though the spirit of the
system, and, above all, the mystic spirit were not just as old as the
world and will not last as long as human mind will last.

Here, then, we have reason to believe that the interest found in the
Kabbalah during so many centuries, in Christianity as well as in
Judaism, in the researches of Philosophy as well as in the speculations
of Theology, is far from being exhausted, and that I am not entirely
wrong in republishing a work which may serve to make it known. After
all, if it only answers the wish of a few curious ones, it will suffice
to dispute the right to count it among books entirely useless.

A. FRANCK.
