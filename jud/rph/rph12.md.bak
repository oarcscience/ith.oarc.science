### CHAPTER III

#### THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE ZOHAR

A much more lively interest, but also more serious difficulty follow the
literary monument still to be considered by us. The Zohar, or the Book
of Brightness, is the universal code of the Kabbalah. Under the modest
form of a commentary on the Pentateuch, it touches, with absolute
independence, upon all questions of a spiritual nature, and, at times,
it rises to the height of doctrines which even in our day the strongest
intellect may be proud of. But it is very far from always maintaining
the same heights. Very often it sinks to a language, to sentiments and
to ideas which betray the lowest degree of ignorance and superstition.
Side by side with the virile simplicity and naive enthusiasm of the
Biblical times, we find names, facts, informations and habits which set
us amidst an epoch of the earliest Middle Ages.

This inequality in form as well as in thought, this fantastic mixture of
characters which differentiate the very widely separated times, and,
finally, the almost absolute silence of the two Talmuds, and the lack of
positive documents until the close of the thirteenth century, have given
rise to the most divergent opinions upon the origin and the author of
this book. We shall present them according to the most ancient and the
most faithful witnesses; we shall then attempt to judge them before
rendering a decision on this difficult question.

All that has been said, all that is still generally thought nowadays of
the formation and of the antiquity of the Zohar, is

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

summed up impartially by two authors whom we have already cited several
times. "The Zohar," says Abraham ben Solomon Zacuto, in his "Book of
Genealogies," <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124.md)--"the Zohar, whose
rays illumine the world, <span id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_125.md) and which
contains the most profound mysteries of the Law and of the Kabbalah, is
not the work of Simeon ben Yohai, although it has been published under
his name. But it was edited by his disciples according to his words, and
his disciples themselves confided the care of the continuation of their
task to other disciples. Written as were the words of the Zohar by men
who had lived long enough to know the Mishnah and all the opinions and
precepts of the oral law, they are, for that reason, all the more in
harmony with the truth. This book was not discovered until after the
death of Rabbi Moses ben Nahman and of Rabbi Asher, who knew of
it." <span id="fr_126"></span>[3](#fn_126.md)

Rabbi Gedaliah, author of the famous chronicle "The Chain of
Tradition," <span id="fr_127"></span>[4](#fn_127.md) expresses his opinion
on the same subject in the following words: "Toward the year five
thousand and fifty of the Creation (1290 Christian era) there were
different persons who claimed that all the parts of the Zohar written in
the Jerusalem dialect (the Aramean dialect) were composed by Rabbi
Simeon ben Yohai, but all those written in the sacred language (pure
Hebrew) ought not to be attributed to him. Others affirmed that Rabbi
Moses ben Nahman, having discovered the book in the Holy Land, sent it
to Catalonia, whence it passed to Aragon and fell into the hands of
Moses de Leon. Finally, several people have thought that Moses de Leon,
who was a learned man, had drawn all these commentaries from his own
imagination, and that he published them under the name of Rabbi Simeon
ben Yohai and his friends, in order to derive great benefit therefrom

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

from the learned quarters. It is added that he acted thus because he was
poor and crushed by burdens." <span id="fr_128"></span>[5](#fn_128.md) "As
far as I am concerned," adds the same author, "I hold that all these
opinions are baseless, and I believe, to the contrary, that Rabbi Simeon
ben Yohai and his pious association did really say all these things and
many more, but it may be that they were not properly drawn up in those
days, and after they have been dispersed in several portions for a long
time, they were finally collected and put in order. This is not
astonishing; for it was thus that our master, Judah the Pious, edited
the Mishnah, the different manuscripts of which were at first scattered
to the four corners of the earth. In like manner Rabbi Ashi also
composed the Gemara."

We see by these words, to which modern criticism has not added much of a
decisive character, that the question we are now considering has already
been solved in three different ways. Some maintain, that, barring a few
passages written in Hebrew--which do not exist nowadays in any edition
or in any known manuscript-- <span id="fr_129"></span>[6](#fn_129.md) the
Zohar pertains entirely to Simeon ben Yohai; others, just as exclusive
in their view, attribute it to an impostor called Moses de Leon, and do
not date it earlier than the end of the thirteenth or the beginning of
the fourteenth century; others, finally, have endeavored to conciliate
these two extreme opinions by supposing that Simeon ben Yohai contented
himself with the propagation of his doctrine through oral teaching, and
that the memories thereof left by him either in the minds or in the
note-books of his disciples, were not united until several centuries
after his death in the book in our possession to-day under the name of
the Zohar.

Considered in the absolute sense, taking the words we have quoted
literally, the first of the two opinions is hardly worthy

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

of serious refutation. Let us first look at the fact which was to serve
as its basis and which we shall borrow from the Talmud: <span
id="fr_130"></span>[7](#fn_130.md)

Rabbi Judah, Rabbi Jose and Rabbi Simeon were together one day, and near
them was a certain Judah ben Gerim. <span
id="fr_131"></span>[8](#fn_131) Rabbi Judah opened (the conversation.md)
and said: "How beautiful are the works of this nation (the Romans). They
let bridges, markets and public baths be erected!" Rabbi Jose kept
silence; but Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai answered: "Whatever they erected is
to their interest only. They built markets to attract prostitutes: they
built baths for their own pleasure; and they built bridges to levy taxes
on." Judah ben Gerim went out and told what he heard, and caused it to
reach the ears of Caesar (the Roman government); and the latter rendered
the following judgment: "Judah, who exalted shall be raised in
dignity; <span id="fr_132"></span>[9](#fn_132.md) Jose, who kept silence,
shall be exiled to Cyprus; <span id="fr_133"></span>[10](#fn_133.md)
Simeon, who spoke ill of me, shall be put to death." Accompanied by his
son, he (Rabbi Yohai) immediately repaired to the house of study,
whither his wife brought him daily a loaf of bread and a bowl of
water. <span id="fr_134"></span>[11](#fn_134.md) But as the proscriptive
decree became too oppressive, he said to his son: "Woman is
light-minded, and when tortured perhaps, may betray us." They,
therefore, left this place to hide in a deep cave.

There, by a miracle, a St. John's bread tree and a spring of water was
created for them. Simeon and his son stripped themselves of their
clothes, and, buried to their necks in sand, they

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

passed all day meditating upon the Law. Twelve years they thus spent in
the cave, until the prophet Elijah came, placed himself at the entrance
of the cave and exclaimed: "Who will announce to the son of Yohai that
Caesar is dead, and that the proscription has been revoked?" They went
forth, <span id="fr_135"></span>[12](#fn_135.md) and saw people sow and
plow.

It is said (although not vouched for any longer by the Talmud) that
during these twelve years of solitude and proscription, Simeon ben
Yohai, aided by Eleazar his son, composed the renowned work to which his
name is still affixed. Were even the fabulous details separated from the
narrative, it would still be difficult to justify the inference drawn
from it; for it is not told what were the results, or what was the
object of the meditations, in which the two proscripts tried to forget
their suffering. Then again, there are a multitude of facts and names
found in the Zohar which Simeon ben Yohai, who died a few years after
the destruction of Jerusalem, in the second century of the Christian
era, could certainly not have known. For instance, how could he have
spoken of the six portions into which the Mishnah is divided, when the
latter was written nearly sixty years after his death? <span
id="fr_136"></span>[13](#fn_136.md) How could he have mentioned the authors
and the procedure of the Gemara which commences at the death of Judah
the Saint, and ends only five hundred years after the birth of
Christ? <span id="fr_137"></span>[14](#fn_137.md) How could he have learned
the names of vowel

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

signs and other inventions of the school of Tiberias which, at most, can
not reach back earlier than the beginning of the sixth century? <span
id="fr_138"></span>[15](#fn_138.md)

Several critics have suggested that under the name of the Ishmaelites
the Zohar refers to the Mohammedan Arabs who are so designated in all
the writings published by modern Jews. The following passage, in fact,
makes it difficult to deny that interpretation:

"The moon is at the same time the sign of good and the sign of evil. The
full moon signifies the good, the new moon signifies the evil; as it
holds equally the good and the evil, the children of Israel and the
children of Ishmael have alike taken it as the rule of their
calculations. <span id="fr_139"></span>[16](#fn_139.md) If an eclipse takes
place during the full moon, it is not a good omen for Israel; if, on the
contrary, the eclipse takes place during the new moon (an eclipse of the
sun), it is a bad omen for Ishmael. Thus are verified the words of the
prophet (Is. XXIX, 14): The wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and
the understanding of their prudent shall be hid." But it must be noted
that these words do not belong to the text; they have been borrowed from
a much less ancient commentary, entitled "The Faithful Shepherd," which
has been slipped into the Zohar by the first editors, on their own
authority, where-ever they thought to have found a gap.

A passage even more decisive could have been found in the Zohar; for the
following is what a disciple of Simeon ben Yohai pretends to have heard
from the mouth of his master: "Woe to the moment when Ishmael was
brought forth and invested with the sign of circumcision! For, what did
the Lord do, Whose name be blessed? He excluded the children of Ishmael
from the celestial union. But as they held the merit having adopted the
sign of the covenant, He reserved for them here below a

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

portion in the possession of the Holy Land. The children of Ishmael are,
therefore, destined to reign over the Holy Land, and they shall hinder
the children of Israel from returning to it. But it shall last only
until the time when the merit of the children of Ishmael shall be
exhausted. They will then excite terrible wars on earth; the children of
Edom will unite against them and war upon them, some on land, some on
sea, and others near Jerusalem. Victory will rest now with one, now with
the other; but the Holy Land will not be delivered into the hands of the
children of Edom."

To understand correctly the sense of these lines, it is sufficient to
know that with the name of Edom the Jewish writers (I speak of those who
made use of the Hebrew language) designated first Pagan Rome, and next
Christian Rome and all ancient Christian peoples in general. Now, as
there can be no question here of Pagan Rome, the intention was doubtless
to speak here of the strife of the Saracens against the Christians, and
even of the crusades before the fall of Jerusalem. As to the prediction
of Simeon ben Yohai, I need not tell what place it is to hold in our
judgment. But I shall not dwell any longer upon the demonstration of
these facts, generally known now and vyingly repeated by all modern
critics. <span id="fr_140"></span>[17](#fn_140.md) We shall add only one
last observation which, I hope, will not be without merit for the
conclusion which we are desirous to reach at last. In order to gain the
conviction that Simeon ben Yohai cannot possibly be the author of the
Zohar, and that the book is not, as has been maintained, the fruit of
thirteen years of meditation and solitude, it is necessary to pay some
attention to the stories which are almost always mingled with the
exposition of the ideas. Thus, in the fragment entitled Idra Zuta, ‏אדרא
זוטא‎, of which we

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

hope to translate a great part, and which forms in every respect an
admirable episode in this vast compilation, it is told that when near
death, Simeon ben Yohai summoned the small number of his disciples and
friends, among whom was also his son Eleazar, for the purpose of giving
them his last instructions.

"Thou," he said to Eleazer, "will teach; Rabbi Abba will write, and my
other friends will meditate in silence." <span
id="fr_142"></span>[18](#fn_142.md) The master Yohai is seldom introduced
as speaking. His doctrines are delivered orally by his son or his
friends, who again come together after his death to communicate to one
another what each one remembered of his teachings, and to enlighten
themselves mutually on the common faith. The words of the Scriptures:
"How good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in
unity," were thought by them applicable to themselves. <span
id="fr_143"></span>[19](#fn_143.md) When some of them meet on the highway,
their conversation immediately turns upon the habitual subject of their
meditations, and some passage of the Old Testament is then explained in
a purely spiritual sense. Here is an example taken at random from
thousands: "Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Jose were together on a journey. Rabbi
Judah then said to his travelling companion: 'Tell me something from the
Law, and the divine spirit will descend to us; for as often as man
meditates upon the words of the Law, the spirit of God either joins him
or goes before him to lead him'." <span id="fr_144"></span>[20](#fn_144.md)

Finally, as has been said before, books are also cited, of which only
widely scattered fragments have come down to us and which necessarily
must be considered more ancient than the Zohar. We translate yet the
following passage which might be believed to have been written by some
disciple of Copernic, were we not compelled, even denying its every
authenticity, to date it, at least, from the end of the thirteenth
century: "In the book of Hamuna

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

the Elder it is fully explained that the earth turns upon itself like a
sphere; that some people are above, others below; that all creatures
change their appearance to the climate of each place, although keeping
always the same position; that certain places on earth are light, while
others are in darkness; that some have day while others have night; and
that there are countries where it is always day, or where night lasts
but a few moments at least." <span id="fr_145"></span>[21](#fn_145.md)

It is quite evident, accordingly, that the author of the Zohar, whoever
he may have been, had not even intended to attribute the book to Simeon
ben Yohai, of whose death and last moments he tells.

Are we, then, forced to honor an obscure rabbi of the thirteenth
century, an unfortunate charlatan who, necessarily, must have devoted
long years in writing it, and who yielded only to the cry of misery and
to the hope of relieving it by such slow and uncertain means? Surely
not! And even were we content with examining the intimate nature and the
intrinsic value of the book, we shall have no trouble at all in
demonstrating that this opinion has no better foundation than the first
one. But we have still more positive arguments to combat it. The Zohar
is written in an Aramean language belonging to no particular dialect.
What scheme could de Leon have had in mind by making use of this idiom
which was not in use in his time? Did he, as is maintained by a modern
critic already quoted, <span id="fr_146"></span>[22](#fn_146.md) desire to
impart a semblance of truth to his fictions by making the various
persons under whose names he wished to pass off his own ideas, speak the
language of their epoch? But since he was in possession of such
widespread knowledge, a fact admitted even by those whose opinions we
combat, he must also have known that Simeon ben Yohai and his friends
were counted among the authors of the

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mishnah; and,
although the Jerusalem dialect was probably their every-day language, it
would have been more natural to make them write in Hebrew.

Some maintain that he really did make use of this last language, that he
did not invent the Zohar, but only falsified it by admixing his own
thoughts, and that his imposture was soon discovered. <span
id="fr_147"></span>[23](#fn_147.md) As nothing of the kind has come down to
us, this assertion need not occupy us any longer. Whether true or false,
it confirms our observations. Besides, we are quite sure that Moses de
Leon wrote a Kabbalistic book in Hebrew which bears the title "The Name
of God," or, simply, "The Name,"--Sefer ha-Sham (‏ספר השם‎).

The work is still in manuscript, and was seen by Moses Cordovero. <span
id="fr_148"></span>[24](#fn_148.md) From the few passages that he quotes,
it is evident that it was a very detailed and, frequently, a very subtle
commentary on some of the most obscure points of the doctrine taught in
the Zohar. The following is an example: "What are the different
channels, i.e., the influences, the mutual relations that exist between
all the Sefiroth, and which channels conduct the divine light, or
primordial substance of things, from one Sefiroh to another?" Is it
possible that the same man, who at first had written the Zohar in the
Chaldeo-Syrian dialect, be it to add interest by the difficulty of the
language, or to make his thoughts inaccessible to the common
people--would then consider it necessary to explain, to further develop
in Hebrew, and place within reach of everybody, that which, at the cost
of so much labor and trouble, he had hidden in a language almost
forgotten even by the scholars themselves? Shall we say, that by such
means he was still more certain of putting his readers on the wrong
scent? Indeed, it is too much trickery, too much time, patience and
effort spent for the miserable aim which he is

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

accused of having placed for himself; the combinations are too learned
and too complicated for a man who has been accused, both of the most
stupid contradictions and the grossest anachronism.

Another reason which compels us to consider the Zohar as a work much
earlier than the time of Moses de Leon, and foreign to Europe, is that
we do not find therein the least vestige of the philosophy of Aristotle,
and that we do not meet there, even once, the name of Christianity or of
its founder. <span id="fr_149"></span>[25](#fn_149.md) It is known, though,
that Christianity and Aristotle exercised absolute authority in Europe
in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. How, then, can we admit that
a poor Spanish rabbi would have written in those fanatical days on
religious subjects, in a language which could not betray him, without
lodging some complaint against Christianity, which the Talmudists and
later writers attacked so frequently, and without being subject, like
Saadia, Maimonides and all those who followed the same path, to the
inevitable influence of the peripatetic philosophy? Were we to read all
the commentaries on the Book of Formation which we possess nowadays,
were we to glance at all the philosophic and religious monuments of that
epoch and of several centuries previous, we shall find everywhere the
language of the "Organum" and the influence of the Stagirite. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[26](#fn_150.md)

The absence of this character is a fact of incontestible importance. We
ought not to look in the Sefiroth, of which we shall speak at greater
length later on, for any veiled imitation of the "Categories"; for while
the latter are but of logical value, the Sefiroth contain a metaphysical
system of the highest order. If the Kabbalah does have a few features
resembling a system of Greek philosophy, it is the Platonic. Yet, it is
known that the

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

same can be claimed for every kind of mysticism, and, besides, Plato was
little known outside his fatherland.

It is to be noted, finally, that the ideas and expressions which belong
essentially, and which are exclusively consecrated to the Kabbalistic
system expounded in the Zohar, are found also in writings of a much
earlier date than the close of the thirteenth century. Thus, according
to a writer whom we had already occasion to mention--Moses Botril, one
of the commentators of the Sefer Yetzirah--the doctrine of emanation, as
understood by the Kabbalists, was known to Saadia; for he (Moses Botril)
cites from him the following words which, he says, are quoted literally
from the work entitled "The Philosopher's Stone" which, it is true, is
wrongly attributed to him: "Oh! thou man who drawest from the cisterns
at the source, <span id="fr_151"></span>[27](#fn_151.md) guard thyself,
when tempted, to reveal something of the belief of the emanation, which
is a great mystery in the mouth of all the Kabbalists; and this mystery
is hidden in the words of the Law: Thou shalt not tempt the Lord." <span
id="fr_152"></span>[28](#fn_152.md)

Nevertheless, Saadia, in his work on "Beliefs and Opinions" attacks very
forcibly the doctrine which is the basis of the system expounded in the
Zohar, and it is impossible not to recognize it in the following
passage: "I have sometimes met men who can not deny the existence of a
Creator, but who think that

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

our mind can not conceive that a thing could be made from nothing. Now,
as the Creator is the only Being who was in existence at first, they
maintain that he drew everything from his own substance. Those men (may
God keep you from their opinion!) have still less sense than all those
of whom we have spoken." <span id="fr_153"></span>[29](#fn_153.md) The
meaning we give to these words becomes still more evident when we read
in the same chapter that the belief to which they allude is especially
justified in the book of Job: <span id="fr_154"></span>[30](#fn_154.md)
"Whence then cometh wisdom, and where is the place of understanding? . .
. God understandeth the way thereof, and He knoweth the place thereof."
(Job, XXVII, 20 and 23.)

We find here, in fact, the names consecrated by the Zohar to the first
three highest <span id="fr_155"></span>[31](#fn_155.md) Sefiroth which
comprise all the others, and which are: Wisdom, Intelligence, and above
them the Place, or the No-Thing (non-ens), <span
id="fr_156"></span>[32](#fn_156.md) so called because it represents the
Infinite, without attribute, without form, without any qualification, a
state devoid of all reality, and therefore incomprehensible to us. <span
id="fr_157"></span>[33](#fn_157.md) It is in this sense, say the
Kabbalists, that all that is was drawn from No-Thing. The same author
gives us also a psychological theory identical with that attributed to
the school of Simeon ben Yohai; <span id="fr_158"></span>[34](#fn_158.md)
and he tells us <span id="fr_159"></span>[35](#fn_159.md) that the dogma of
pre-existence and of transmigration of the soul, which is distinctly
taught in the

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Zohar, <span
id="fr_160"></span>[36](#fn_160.md) was accepted in his days by several men
who, nevertheless, called themselves Jews, and who, he adds, confirmed
their extravagant opinion by the testimony of the Scriptures. Nor is
this all. St. Jerome, in one of his letters, <span
id="fr_161"></span>[37](#fn_161.md) speaks of ten mystical names, decem
nomina mystica, by which the sacred books designated the Divinity. Now,
these ten names which St. Jerome not only mentions, but of which he
gives the full enumeration, are precisely the same which represent in
the Zohar the ten Sefiroth or attributes of God.

The following is what we really read in the Book of Mystery (Sifra
D’Zeniuta--‏ספרא דצינעותא‎), one of the most ancient fragments of the
Zohar, and, at the same time, a resume of the highest principles of the
Kabbalah: "When man wishes to address a prayer to the Lord, he may
invoke either the holy names of God: Eh-yeh, Jehovah, Yah, El, Elohim,
Yedoud, Elohei-Zebaot, Shaddai, Adonai, or the ten Sefiroth, namely: the
Crown, Wisdom, Intelligence, Beauty, Grace, Justice, etc." All
Kabbalists agree on the principle that the ten names of God and the ten
Sefiroth are one and the same. For, they say, the spiritual part of the
names of God is the very essence of the divine numbers. <span
id="fr_162"></span>[38](#fn_162.md) In several of his writings, St. James
speaks also of "certain Hebrew traditions on Genesis" which attribute to
Paradise, or, as is always called in Hebrew, Gan Eden (‏גן עדן‎), a
greater antiquity than that of the world. <span
id="fr_163"></span>[39](#fn_163.md)

Let us note first, that among the Jews there were no other traditions of
an analogous title known, than those contained in the mysterious science
called by the Talmud the "History of Genesis."

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

As to the belief of those traditions, it is in perfect harmony with the
Zohar, where the Supreme Wisdom, the Divine word by which creation was
begun and accomplished, the principle of all intelligence and of all
life, is designated as the true Eden, otherwise called the Higher Eden
(Eden E-to-oh; ‏עדן עלאה‎). <span id="fr_164"></span>[40](#fn_164.md)

But a fact more important than all the facts hitherto noted, is the
intimate resemblance offered by the Kabbalah, in language as well as in
thought, with the sects of Gnosticism, chiefly those brought forth in
Syria, and with the religious code of the Nazarene which was discovered
a few years ago, and translated from the Syrian into Latin. We shall
postpone the proof of this fact to that part of our work where we shall
investigate the relation-ship between the Kabbalistic system and the
other religions or philosophical systems. Here we shall only point out
that the doctrines of Simon the Magician, Elcsaite, Bardesanes and
Valentine, are known to us only by fragments scattered through the works
of a few of the Fathers of the Church, as in those of Irenaeus and
Clement of Alexandria. Now, we can not suppose that those works were
familiarly known to a rabbi of the thirteenth century, who, even in the
very work with the authorship of which some wish to honor him, proves to
be quite a stranger to any literature, and especially to that of
Christianity. We are, therefore, forced to admit that Gnosticism
borrowed a great deal, if not precisely from the Zohar as we know it
today, at least from the traditions and from the theories contained
therein.

We shall not separate the hypothesis which we just refuted from the one
which presents to us the Kabbalah as an imitation of the mystic
philosophy of the Arabs, and dates its birth some time during the reign
of the caliphs, at the earliest, near the beginning of the eleventh
century, at the epoch when the philosophy of the Mussulmans first showed
traces of mysticism. <span id="fr_165"></span>[41](#fn_165.md) This

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

opinion, long ago expressed as a mere conjecture in the Mémoires de
l’Academie des Inscriptions (Memoirs of the Academy of
Inscriptions), <span id="fr_166"></span>[42](#fn_166.md) has recently been
[resuscitated](errata.htm#7.md) by Mr. Tholuck, who lent to it the support
of his rich erudition. In a preliminary memoir in which he investigated
the influence the Greek philosophy may have exercised over the
philosophy of the Mahommedans, <span id="fr_167"></span>[43](#fn_167.md)
the learned orientalist comes to the conclusion that the doctrine of the
emanation was known to the Arabs simultaneously with Aristotle's system;
for the latter reached them through the commentaries of Themistius,
Theon of Smyrna, Aeneus of Gaza and Johann Philoponus, in short, with
the ideas of Alexandria, expressed, surely, in a very incomplete form.
This germ, once deposited in the breast of Islamism, developed rapidly
into a vast system which, like the system of Plotinus, raised enthusiasm
above reason, and, after making all beings spring from the divine
substance, proposed to man, as the last step of perfection, a reunion
with it through ecstasy and annihilation of self.

It is this, half Arabic, half Greek mysticism, that Tholuck would have
us admit as the true and only source of the Kabbalah. <span
id="fr_168"></span>[44](#fn_168.md) To that end he begins by attacking the
authenticity of the Kabbalistic books, above all, that of the Zohar,
which he regards as a compilation dating from the end of the thirteenth
century, although he accords greater antiquity to the Kabbalah
itself. <span id="fr_169"></span>[45](#fn_169.md) After having established
this point beyond doubt, as he believes, he undertakes to demonstrate
the close resemblance of the ideas contained in those books to those
which form the substance of Arabian mysticism. Mr. Tholuck has advanced
no argument against the authenticity of the Kabbalah which we have not
already refuted; we shall stop only at the last and, undoubtedly,

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

the most interesting part of his work. But here we are forced to
anticipate somewhat and enter into the very foundation of the
Kabbalistic system and into some consideration bearing upon its origin.
We shall not complain if this will give us some diversion from the
rather dry research which occupies us at this moment.

The first thought which presents itself to the mind is, that the
similarity between the Hebrew and the Arabic ideas, even if perfectly
established, nowise concludes that the first ones are necessarily
counterfeits of the latter. Is it not possible that both departed, by
different channels, though, from one common source, much older than the
Mussulman philosophy, much older even than the Greek philosophy of
Alexandria? And Mr. Tholuck' must really admit that, as far as the
Arabians are concerned, they knew the philosophy of Alexandria not at
all from its real sources. The works of Plotinus, of Jamblicus and of
Proclus never reached them, and none of these had ever been translated
either into Arabic or Syrian; and of the works of Porphyrius, they
possessed only a purely logical commentary: the introduction to the
treaties of the Categories. <span id="fr_170"></span>[46](#fn_170.md)

On the other hand, is it probable that at the time of the Mussulman
invasion no trace was left of the ideas of ancient Persia and of the
philosophy of the Magi, so famous throughout antiquity under the name of
the "Wisdom of the Orient;" and that they took no part in the
intellectual movement which made the reign of the Abbassides so
famous? <span id="fr_171"></span>[47](#fn_171.md) We know that Avicenna
wrote a book on the "Oriental Wisdom." By what right, then, dare some
affirm, upon the strength of a few rare citations of a more modern
author, that this book was but a collection of Neoplatonic
thoughts? <span id="fr_172"></span>[48](#fn_172.md)

When Mr. Tholuck directs our attention to the following

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

passage of Al Gazzali: <span id="fr_173"></span>[a](#fn_173.md) "Know, that
between the physical world and the one of which we just spoke, there
exists the same relation as between our shadow and our body," <span
id="fr_174"></span>[49](#fn_174.md) how is it that he does not remember
that the Zerdustians, members of one of the religious sects of ancient
Persia, used those same terms and the same comparison to formulate the
fundamental principle of their belief? <span
id="fr_175"></span>[50](#fn_175.md)

As to the Jews, the whole world knows that from the time of their
captivity until the time of their dispersion they continued their
relations with what they called the land of Babylon. We will not dwell
upon this point which is to be considered at length later. We will only
say that the Zohar positively quotes the Oriental Wisdom: "That wisdom,"
it says, "known to the children of the East since the first days," <span
id="fr_176"></span>[51](#fn_176.md) and from which it cites an example in
perfect accord with its own doctrines. It is evident that the reference
here made has no bearing upon the Arabians whom the Hebrew writers
invariably call "the children of Ishmael," or "the children of Arabia."
A contemporaneous foreign philosophy, a recent product of the influence
of Aristotle and his Alexandrian commentators, could not have been
spoken of in such terms; the Zohar would not have dated it from the
first ages of the world, nor would it have presented it as a legacy
transmitted by Abraham to the children of his concubine, and by those to
the nations of the Orient. <span id="fr_177"></span>[52](#fn_177.md)

But we need not make use even of this argument, for the truth is that
Arabic mysticism and the principles taught in the Zohar strike us by
their differences rather than by their similarities.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> While these bear
exclusively upon a few general ideas, common to all species of
mysticism, the others cast a glow mainly upon the most essential points
of the metaphysics of both systems, and leave no room for doubt that
they were of different origins. Thus, to bring out the most important of
the differences, we draw attention to the following: The Arabian
mystics, recognizing in God the unique substance of all things and the
immanent cause of the universe, teach that He reveals or manifests
Himself under three different aspects: 1st, in the aspect of unity or of
absolute being, in the heart of which there rests as yet no distinction;
2nd, the aspect in which the objects of which the universe is composed
begin to differentiate themselves in their essence and in intelligible
forms, and to show themselves as present before the divine intelligence.
The third divine manifestation is the universe itself, it is the true
world, God become visible. <span id="fr_178"></span>[53](#fn_178.md)

The Kabbalistic system is far from showing such simplicity. True, it
also presents to us the divine substance as the unique substance, the
inexhaustible source from which all life, all light and all existence
flow eternally; but instead of three manifestations, three general forms
of the Infinite Being, it recognizes at once ten, the ten Sefiroth which
divide themselves into three trinities, and then unite in one single
trinity and one Supreme form. Considered as a whole, the Sefiroth
represent only the first degree, the first sphere, of existence, that
which is called the world of Emanation. Below these there are still to
be found, each apart and offering an infinite variety--the world of Pure
Spirit, or the world of Creation; the world of Spheres or of the
intelligences directing them, called the world of Formation, and
finally, that lowest degree called the world of Work, or the world of
Action. <span id="fr_179"></span>[54](#fn_179.md)

The Arabian mystics recognize also a collective soul, from

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

which all the world animating souls emanate, a generating spirit whom
they call the Father of Spirits, the Spirit of Mohammed, the source,
model and substance of all the other spirits. <span
id="fr_180"></span>[55](#fn_180.md)

An attempt has been made to find the pattern of the Adam Kadmon, the
Celestial Man of the Kabbalists in this thought. But what the Kabbalists
designate by that name is not only the principle of intelligence and of
spiritual life, but it is also something which they regard as above and
as below the spirit; it is the totality of the Sephiroth, or the world
of Emanation in its entirety, from the Being in His most abstract and
most intangible character, the degree called by them *the point* or the
*non-being*, to the constituent forces of nature. Not a trace of the
idea of metempsychosis, which holds so important a place in the Hebraic
system, can be found in the beliefs of the Arabians. In vain do we also
search in their works for those allegories met with in the Zohar; for
that constant appeal to tradition, for those bold personifications which
multiply by endless genealogies--genealogiis interminatis--as St. Paul
says, <span id="fr_181"></span>[56](#fn_181.md) and for those gigantic and
fantastic metaphors which are so well compatible with the spirit of the
ancient Orient.

At the end of his work, Tholuck himself, whose frankness equals his
science, retreats from the thought which first misled him, and
concludes, as we also may conclude, that it is entirely impossible to
consider the Kabbalah as derived from the mystic philosophy of the
Arabians. However, let us give his own words, which hold authority as
coming from the mouth of a man profoundly learned in the philosophy and
in the language of the Mussulman people: "What can we conclude from the
analogies? Very little, to my mind. For, whatever is alike in the two
systems, will also

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

be found in the more ancient doctrines, in the books of the Sabeans and
the Persians, and also among the neo-platonians. On the contrary, the
extraordinary form under which those ideas appear in the Kabbalah is
entirely strange to the Arabian mystics. Besides, in order to make sure
that the Kabbalah really derived from the contact with the latter, it
would be necessary, first of all, to find the Sefiroth among them. But
not the least trace of the Sefiroth can be found among the Arabians; for
they knew only one mode under which God revealed Himself. On this point,
the Kabbalah comes much nearer to the doctrine of the Sabeans and to
Gnosticism." <span id="fr_182"></span>[57](#fn_182.md) . . . The Arabic
origin of the Kabbalah once proved inadmissible, the other theory, which
makes of the Zohar a work. of the thirteenth century, loses the last
support. I shall speak of a certain air of probability of which this
theory may still boast. As already evidenced by the parallel which we
have established, the Zohar really contains a highly important and
widely embracing system. A conception of such a nature is not formed in
one day, especially in an age of ignorance and blind faith, and with a
class of people groaning under the heavy burden of contempt and
persecution. And so, as we can not find any of the antecedents or
elements of the system of the Kabbalah in the Middle Ages, we must look
for its origin in an earlier antiquity.

We have come now to those who say that Simeon ben Yohai really taught
the metaphysical and religious doctrine (which forms the basis of the
Zohar) to a small number of disciples and friends, among whom was his
son; that these lessons, though transmitted at first by word of mouth as
inviolable secrets, were edited little by little; and that these
traditions and notes, to which commentaries of more recent time were
necessarily added, accumulated and, therefore altered in time, finally
reached Europe from

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Palestine towards
the close of the thirteenth century. We hope that this opinion, until
now expressed with timidity and as a conjecture, will soon acquire the
character and the rights of certainty.

This opinion, above all, is in perfect accord, as we already noted by
the author of the chronicle "Chain of Tradition," with the history of
all the other religious monuments of the Jewish people. The Mishnah, the
Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds were also made up by joining the
traditions of different ages and the lessons of different teachers, held
together by a common principle. It agrees no less with a belief which,
according to the historian just cited, must be quite old. "I have
learned from tradition," says the author, "that this work was so
voluminous, that when complete, it would have made up a camel's
load." <span id="fr_183"></span>[58](#fn_183.md) Now, it can not be
supposed that one man, had he even spent his whole life in writing on
such matters, could have left such deferring proof of his
productiveness. Finally, we read in the Supplements of the Zohar, (Tikun
ha-Zohar--‏תקוני הזהר‎), which are written in the same language, and
known just as long as the Zohar itself, that the latter will never be
entirely published, or, to translate more faithfully, that it will be
disclosed at the end of the days. <span id="fr_184"></span>[59](#fn_184.md)

If we now examine the book itself for the purpose of searching therein,
without prejudice, for some light on its origin, we must soon notice, by
the inequality of style <span id="fr_185"></span>[60](#fn_185.md) and lack
of unity, not in the system, it is true, but in the exposition, method,
application of general principles and, finally, in the consideration of
details, that it is utterly impossible to ascribe it to one person. Not
to multiply unimportant examples, and not to insist upon facts of
language which no translation can preserve--just as it is impossible

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

to tear certain plants from their native soil without killing them--we
shall limit ourselves to indicating rapidly the different principles
which separate three fragments already mentioned from the rest of the
work, namely, "The Book of Mystery," Sifra d’Zeniuto--‏ספרא דצניעותא‎,
generally considered as the most ancient; "the Great Assembly," Idra
Rabba--‏אדרא רבא‎, where Simeon ben Yohai is shown in the midst of all
his friends; and, finally, "The Lesser Assembly," Idra Zutah--‏אדרא
זוטא‎, where Simeon, on his death-bed after having been preceded to the
grave by three of his disciples, gives his last instructions to the
surviving.

These fragments which, because of the great distance between them, seem
to us at first sight lost in this immense collection, form,
nevertheless, a perfectly co-ordinated whole in the progress of events
as well as in the ideas. We find there, now in allegorical form, now in
metaphysical language, a consecutive and pompous description of the
divine attributes, of their different manifestations, of the manner in
which the world was formed, and of the relations between God and man.
Never are there the heights of speculation left to descend to the
external and practical life, to recommend the observation of the Law or
the ceremonies of religion. Never can we find there a name, a fact, or
even an expression which could make us doubt the authenticity of these
pages in which originality of form enhances the value of the lofty
thoughts.

It is always the teacher who speaks, and who uses no other method but
that of authority to convince his listeners. He does not demonstrate, he
does not explain, he does not repeat what others have taught him; but he
affirms, and every word spoken by him is received as an article of
faith. That character is especially noticeable in the "Book of Mystery,"
which is a substantial, though very obscure, summary of the entire
work. <span id="fr_186"></span>[61](#fn_186.md) It may be

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

said of it also: decebat quasi auctoritatem habens (He taught as though
he had authority).

The mode of procedure in the rest of the book is different. Instead of
continued exposition of one order of idea, instead of a freely conceived
plan persistently followed, in which the sacred texts invoked by the
author as testimony follow his own thoughts, we find there the
incoherent and disorderly course of a commentary. The exposition of the
Holy Scriptures is, nevertheless, a mere pretext, as we have already
remarked; but, it is no less true that, without entirely leaving the
same circle of ideas, we are often led by the text from one subject to
another. This gives rise to the thought, that the notes and the
traditions preserved in the school of Simeon ben Yohai were, according
to the spirit of the times, adjusted to the principal passages of the
Pentateuch instead of being fused into a common system according to a
logical order. We are strengthened in this opinion, when we take the
trouble to assure ourselves that there is often not the least connection
between the Biblical text and the part of the Zohar which serves it as a
commentary.

The same incoherence, the same disorder prevail in the facts which, for
the rest, are few in number and of uniform character. Here metaphysical
theology no longer reigns in absolute

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

sovereignity; but, side by side with the boldest and the most elevated
theories, all too often we find the most material details of the
external cult, or those puerile questions to which the gemarists,
similar therein to the causuists of all other beliefs, consecrated so
many years and so many volumes. Here are assembled all the arguments
which modern critics have brought forward in favor of the opinion common
to them, and which we believe we have just proved to be false.
Everything, finally, the form as well as the background in this last
portion of the book, bear the traces of a more recent epoch; while the
simplicity, the naive and credulous enthusiasm which reign in the first
portion, often remind us of the time and language of the Bible.

Not to anticipate, we can cite but one example from there: the story of
the death of Simeon ben Yohai as told by Rabbi Abba, the disciple whom
he charged with the editing of his teachings. We shall attempt the
translation. "The holy light (so Simeon was called by his disciples),
the holy light had as yet not finished this last phrase, when his words
stopped, and yet I continued to write. I had expected to write a long
time yet, when I heard nothing more. I did not lift my head, for the
light was too strong to look at. Suddenly I was violently agitated, and
I heard a voice crying 'Long days, years of life and of happiness are
now before thee.' Then I heard another voice which said: 'He asked for
life of thee, and thou hast given him eternal years.' During the entire
day the fire did not leave the house, and no one dared come near him
because of the fire and the light which surrounded him. All that day I
lay stretched upon the ground, and I gave free course to my
lamentations. When the fire departed, I saw that the holy light, the
saint of saints, had departed from this world. He was stretched out
there, lying on his right side, with a smiling face. His son Eleazar
arose, took his hands and covered them with kisses; but I would have
gladly eaten the dust that his feet had touched. Then all his friends
came to weep for him, but none of them could break the silence.

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But at last their
tears ran. Rabbi Eleazar, his son, fell upon the ground three times,
unable to utter but these words: 'My father! My father!' Rabbi Hiah was
first to rise on his feet, and said these words: 'Until today the holy
light has not ceased to give us light and to watch over us; now we have
nothing left to render him but his last honors.' Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi
Abba arose to put upon him his death garments; then all his friends met
in tumult around him and from all the house exhaled perfume. He was
stretched upon his bier, find none but Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Abba took
part in that sad duty. When the bier was carried away, they saw him on
high and a brilliant light shone before his face. Then they heard a
voice which said: 'Come and assemble to the nuptial feast of Rabbi
Simeon!' . . . Such was Rabbi Simeon, son of Yohai, for whom the Lord
gave glory to Himself each day. In this world and in the world to come
his part is lovely. Of him it was written: 'But thou go thy way toward
the end, and thou shalt rest in peace, and arise again for thy lot at
the end of the days'." <span id="fr_187"></span>[62](#fn_187.md)

We do not want to exaggerate the value which these words may add to the
observations that precede them; but they give us at least an idea of the
character attributed to Simeon by his disciples, and of the religious
homage which his name inspired in the entire Kabbalistic school.

A more evident proof in favor of the opinion that we are defending will
be doubtless found in the following text which we have nowhere seen
cited, although it is to be found in every edition of the Zohar, in the
oldest as well as in the most modern. After distinguishing two kinds of
doctors, those of the Mishnah, ‏מארי משנה‎, and those of the Kabbalah,
‏מארי קבלה‎, it is added: "It is of these latter the prophet Daniel
spoke when he said: And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness
of the firmament. They are those who occupy themselves with this book
which is called the Book of Brightness, which, like the ark of

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Noah, takes in two
of a city and seven of a kingdom; but sometimes there is but one of the
same city, and two of the same family. It is in them that the words are
fulfilled: Every male shall be cast into the river. Now, the river <span
id="fr_188"></span>[63](#fn_188.md) is none other than the light of this
book." <span id="fr_189"></span>[64](#fn_189.md) These words form a part of
the Zohar, and yet it is evident that the Zohar was already in existence
at the time when they were written; it was even known under the name it
now bears. We are, therefore, forced to the conclusion that it developed
gradually during the course of several centuries, and by the labor of
several generations of Kabbalists.

Here is the substance--as the translation would require too much
space--of another passage very precious in all respects, and by which we
want to show especially that long after the death of Simeon ben Yohai
his doctrine was preserved in Palestine where the master lived and
taught, and that emissaries were sent from Babylon to collect some of
his words. One day when Rabbi Jose and Rabbi Hezekiah were travelling
together, the conversation turned upon the verse of Ecclesiastes: "For
that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing
befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all
one kind of spirit." <span id="fr_190"></span>[65](#fn_190.md) The two
doctors could not comprehend that king Solomon, the wisest of men, had
written those words which, if I may use the original expression, are an
open door for those who have no faith. <span
id="fr_191"></span>[66](#fn_191.md) While reasoning thus, they were
accosted by a man who, fatigued by a long voyage and a hot sun, asked
them for water to drink. They gave him wine, <span
id="fr_192"></span>[67](#fn_192.md) and led him to a spring

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

of water. As soon as he felt refreshed, the stranger told them that he
was one of their co-religionists, and that through the mediation of his
son, who devoted his entire time to the study of the Law, he was
initiated into this science. The question which occupied them before his
[arrival](errata.htm#8.md) was then submitted to him.

For the aim we wish to reach here it is useless to tell how the stranger
solved the question; we only want to say that he was actively applauded
and that they permitted him to part very reluctantly. Somewhat later,
the two Kabbalists found means of ascertaining that this man was one of
the Friends (this is how the adepts of the doctrine are called in the
entire work); that, because of humility he, one of the most renowned of
the doctors of his time, gave his son the honor of knowledge admired in
him; and that he came to Palestine, accompanied by the Friends, to
collect some of the sayings of Simeon ben Yohai and his disciples. <span
id="fr_193"></span>[68](#fn_193.md)

All the other facts recorded in this book are of the same color and take
place on the same stage. When we add, that frequent mention is made
there of the religious beliefs of the Orient, like Sabeism <span
id="fr_194"></span>[69](#fn_194.md) and even of Islamism; that to the
contrary, nothing is found there which can have any reference to the
Christian religion, we shall understand how the Zohar, in its present
condition, could not have been introduced into our countries until some
time near the end of the thirteenth century. Some of the doctrines
contained therein, as Saadia has shown, were already known before; but
it seems certain that before Moses de Leon, and before the departure of
Nahmanides for the Holy Land, there existed no complete manuscript in
Europe.

As to the ideas contained in the Zohar, Simeon ben Yohai himself tells
us that he was not the first one to introduce them. He repeated to his
disciples what the "Friends" taught in the

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

ancient books (‏ומה דאמרנו חברנא בספרי קדמאי‎). He particularly cites
Jeba the Elder and Hamuna the Elder; and at the moment when he is about
to reveal the greatest secrets of the Kabbalah, he expresses the hope
that the shade of Hamunah will come to listen to him, followed by a
procession of seventy of the Just. <span
id="fr_195"></span>[70](#fn_195.md) I am far from pretending that either
these personages, or these books of so remote an antiquity, really
existed; I only wish to establish the fact that the authors of the Zohar
never thought of representing Simeon ben Yohai as the inventor of the
Kabbalistic science.

There is another fact which deserves on our part the most serious
attention. More than a century after the Zohar was published in Spain,
there were still some men who knew, and who transmitted most of the
ideas which form the substance of the Zohar, by tradition only. Of such
was Moses Botril, who, in 1409, as he himself tells us, <span
id="fr_196"></span>[71](#fn_196.md) expresses himself on the Kabbalah and
on the precautions to be taken in teaching it: "The Kabbalah is nothing
other than a more pure and a more holy philosophy; only that the
language of philosophy is not the same as that of the Kabbalah. . .
. <span id="fr_197"></span>[72](#fn_197.md) It is so named because it
proceeds, not by reasoning, but by tradition. And when the master has
developed these matters for his disciple, that disciple must not have
too much confidence in his wisdom; he is not permitted to speak of this
science if not formally authorized first by the master. This right,
namely, to speak about the *Merkabah*, will be accorded to him when he
has given proof of his intelligence, and if the seed deposited in his
breast, has borne fruit. On the contrary, it will be necessary to
recommend silence to him, if he is found to be but an extrinsic person,
and if he has, as yet, not reached the degree of those who distinguish
themselves by their meditations." (See Botril's Commentary, fol. 87b.)

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

Apparently, the author of these lines did not seem to know the Zohar
even by its name, as the name is not mentioned a single time in any part
of his work. On the other hand, he cites a large number of very ancient
writers, nearly all of whom belong to the Orient, like Rabbi Saadia,
Rabbi Hai and Rabbi Aaron, head of the Babylonian academy. Sometimes he
tells us also of the things he learned orally from the mouth of his
master. So it can not be supposed that he drew his Kabbalistic knowledge
from the manuscripts published by Nahmanides and Moses de Leon. Still,
the Kabbalistic system, of which Simeon ben Yohai may be considered at
least the most illustrious representative, was preserved and propagated,
after as well as before the thirteenth century, by a multitude of
traditions which some were pleased to write down, while others, more
faithful to the method of their ancestors, guarded them religiously in
their memory.

Only such traditions as took birth from the first century until near the
end of the seventh century of the Christian era, are found in the Zohar.
In fact, we can not date--I would not say the compilation, but the
existence of these traditions, so very similar or closely connected to
one another by the spirit animating them--from an epoch less remote; for
at that time they already knew of the Merkabah which is nothing more, as
we know, than that part of the Kabbalah to which the Zohar is specially
consecrated; and Simeon ben Yohai himself tells us that he had
predecessors. It is equally impossible for us to consider its birth in
an age nearer to us; for we know of no fact which authorizes such a
conclusion. The insurmountable difficulties encountered in the opinions
differing from ours, thus become positive facts which confirm our
opinions, and which should not be counted as the last among the proofs
of which we have made use.

There still remain two more objections to be refuted. It has been asked
how the principle which is the basis of our present-day Cosmography, or
the system of Copernic, so clearly summed up in a passage we have
translated above, could have been known

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

at the remote time from which we date the origin of the principal
element of the Kabbalistic system. We answer that, in any case,
admitting even that the Zohar is nothing but an imposture of the close
of the thirteenth century, this passage was known before the birth of
the Prussian astronomer. Again, the ideas contained in that passage were
already spread among the ancients; for Aristotle attributes them to the
school of Pythagoras. "Nearly all those," he says, "who assume to have
studied the sky in its entirety, claim that the earth is at the centre;
but the philosophers of the Italian school, otherwise called
Pythagoreans, teach the contrary. In their opinion, the centre is
occupied by fire, and the earth is only a star, the circular movement of
which around that centre produces light and day." <span
id="fr_198"></span>[73](#fn_198.md)

In their attack against philosophy, the first fathers of the church did
not regard it as a duty to spare that opinion which is, in fact,
irreconcilable with the cosmological system taught in Genesis. "It is,"
said Lactantius, <span id="fr_199"></span>[74](#fn_199.md) "an absurdity to
believe that there are men who have the feet above their heads, and that
there are countries where everything is upside down, where the trees and
the plants grow from above down. . . We find the germ of this error
among the philosophers who claimed that the earth is round." <span
id="fr_200"></span>[75](#fn_200.md) St. Augustine expresses himself on the
same subject in very similar terms. (De Civitat. Dei, lib. 16, ch. 9.)

Finally, even the most ancient authors of the Gemara had knowledge of
the antipodes and of the spherical form of the earth; for we read in the
Jerusalem Talmud (Aboda Zarah, ch. 3), that

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

while overrunning the earth to conquer it, Alexander the Great learned
that it was round, and it is added that for this reason Alexander is
represented with a globe in his hand. But even the fact which was
thought to hold an objection against us, serves as proof; for during the
entire duration of the Middle Ages, the true system of the world was
barely known and the system of Ptolemy <span
id="fr_201"></span>[76](#fn_201.md) reigned undivided.

It is also astonishing to find precisely in that part of the Zohar which
is to be considered the most ancient, medical knowledge which seems to
betray a familiarity with quite recent civilization. For example, the
Idra Rabba, or the portion entitled "The Great Assembly," contains these
remarkable lines which may be believed to have been taken from some
modern treatise on anatomy: "In the interior of the skull, the brain is
divided into three parts, each one of which occupies a distinct place.
It is covered, besides, with a very thin veil, and then with another,
tougher, veil. By means of thirty-two channels, these three parts of the
brain ramify into the entire body along on either side. They thus
embrace the body from all sides and spread out in all it parts." <span
id="fr_202"></span>[77](#fn_202.md)

We can not fail to recognize in these words the three principal organs
of which the brain and its principal coverings are composed, and the
thirty-two pairs of nerves which proceed from them in a symmetrical
order to give life and sensation to the entire animal economy. We must
note, though, that, compelled to submit to a mass of religious precepts
relating to their food, and obliged to observe the different states and
different constitutions of the animals for fear of eating of that which
the Law declares unclean, the Jews were early stimulated, by the most
potent of forces, to

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

the study of anatomy and natural history. Thus, the Talmud counts
generally the perforation of the covering of the brain, ‏ניקב קרום של
מיח‎, among the affections which may befall the animal, and so forbids
the use of its flesh.

But there is a condition upon which opinions are divided. According to
some, the prohibition is only valid when both coverings are perforated;
according to others, it is sufficient when the perforation is found in
the tough covering (dura mater) only. <span
id="fr_203"></span>[78](#fn_203.md) Others, finally, are content with a
dissolution of the continuity in the two interior cerebral
coverings. <span id="fr_204"></span>[79](#fn_205.md) In the same treatise
the spinal marrow, ‏חוט השדרה‎, <span id="fr_205"></span>[80](#fn_206.md)
is also spoken of, and the diseases peculiar to it. We wish to add, that
since the middle of the second century there were professional
physicians among the Hebrews; for it is told in the Talmud (Baba Meziah,
85b) that Judah the Pious, the editor of the Mishnah, suffered for
thirteen years from an affection of the eye, and that his physician was
Rabbi Samuel, one of the most zealous defenders of the Tradition, a man
who, besides medicine, occupied himself with astronomy and mathematics.
It was said of him that "the paths of the heavens were as well known to
him as the streets of his native city." <span
id="fr_206"></span>[81](#fn_207.md)

Here we close--and, no doubt, it is time to end--these purely
bibliographical observations and, what we would call, the external
history of the Kabbalah. The books we have had under examination

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

are not, as enthusiasts have confidently affirmed, of either
supernatural origin or of prehistoric antiquity. Neither are they, as a
skeptical, superficial critic still assumes, the product of imposture
conceived and consummated in sordid interest, the work of a
hunger-driven charlatan devoid of all ideas and convictions, speculating
in gross credulity. Once more to repeat: These two books are the product
of several generations. Whatever may be the value of the doctrines
contained in them, they will always be worthy of preservation as a
monument to the long and patient effort of intellectual liberty in the
heart of a people and a time when religious despotism made the most use
of its power. But this is not the only claim to our interest. As we have
already said, and as we shall soon be convinced, the system they contain
is, in itself, by reason of its origin and of the influence it
exercised, a very important factor in the history of human thought.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[98:27](rph12.htm#fr_151.md) I have translated
literally the French text, but it does not render as yet the correct
meaning of the Hebrew original, although the author had taken notice of
Dr. Jellinek's remark to this phrase in the German translation. The
correct and literal translation would be: "Oh, thou man who hath
(possesses) the pools at the source. . ." While the author failed to
translate the word ‏בריכות‎ (Brihoth) in the first edition, he omitted
the translation of the word ‏במקור‎ (B’moker) in the second edition.
‏בריכות‎ (Brihoth) is the plural of ‏בריכה‎ (Briho), and means "pool" or
"pond," and ‏מקור‎ (Moker) means "source." So also further on in the
same sentence the author [erroneously](errata.htm#6.md) translates ‏וזהו
סוד‎ with "un autre mystère" (another mystery), while it should be
rendered with "and this mystery . . "--Transl.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[98:28](rph12.htm#fr_152.md) Here is the Hebrew

gives the following graceful allegory: Let us <span id="page_110">p.

and who knows nothing of the ways of the city. He sows wheat, and eats
nothing but wheat in its natural state. One day that man goes into the
city. They give him a loaf of bread of good quality, and he asks: "What
is this good for?" They answer him: "It is bread to eat." He takes it
and eats it with pleasure. Then he asks again: "What is it made of?"
They answer that it is made, of wheat. Some time after that they give
him a cake kneaded with oil. He takes it, then he asks: "And this, what
is it made of?" They answer him--"Of wheat." Somewhat later they set
before him royal pastry kneaded with oil and honey. He asks the same
question. Then he says: "I am master of all these things. I taste them
in their root, since I nourish myself from the wheat of which they are
made." Because of this thought he remains a stranger to the delights
that men find in eating, and those delights are lost to him. It is the
same with the one who halts at the general principles of science; for he
is ignorant of all the delights that are drawn from those principles.
