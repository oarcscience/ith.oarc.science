# PART ONE

### CHAPTER I

#### THE ANTIQUITY OF THE KABBALAH

Enthusiastic partisans of the Kabbalah declare it to have been brought
down by angels from heaven to teach the first man, after his
disobedience, the way to recover his primal nobility and bliss. <span
id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71.md) Others supposed that the lawgiver of the
Hebrews, during his forty days' stay on Mount Sinai, received it
directly from God, that He transmitted it to seventy old men who partook
with Him of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and that these passed it on by
word of mouth until the time when Ezra was given the order to transcribe
it together with the Law. <span id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_72.md) But, no
matter how carefully we may read all the books of the Old Testament, we
shall fail to find a single word which refers to secret teachings or to
a doctrine more profound and more pure, reserved solely for a small
number of the elect.

Since its origin, until its return from the Babylonian captivity, the
Hebrew people, like all nations in their infancy, knew no other organs
of truth, no other ministers to the mind, save the prophet, the priest
and the poet; and in spite of the obvious difference among them, the
latter is often confounded with the previous ones. Instruction was not
the province of the priest, he simply attracted the eye by the pomp of
religious ceremonies. And as to the teachers, those, indeed, who raise
the religion to the rank of Science and who replace the inspirational
language with a dogmatic strain, in short, as to the theologians, there
is no

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

mention of either their name or their existence during that entire
period.

It is only at the beginning of the third century before the Christian
era that we first see them appear under the general name of Tannaim,
which means teachers of the tradition; for it is in the name of this new
power that everything, not clearly expressed in the Scriptures, was
taught. The Tannaim, the oldest and most respected of all teachers in
Israel, formed, as it were, a long chain, the last link of which is
Judah the Pious, editor of the Mishnah, who collected and transmitted to
posterity all that has been uttered by his predecessors. Among these are
the supposed authors of the oldest monuments of the Kabbalah, R. Akkiba
and Simeon ben Yohai, with his son and his friends.

Immediately after the death of Judah, towards the close of the second
century of the Christian era, a new generation of teachers starts who
are called Amaraim (‏אמראים‎), because, not constituting any longer an
authority in themselves, they only repeated and better explained all
they learned from the previous ones, making known those of their words
which have as yet not been published. These commentaries and new
traditions, which multiplied prodigiously for more than three hundred
years, were finally united under the name of Gemara ‏גמרא‎, i.e.
termination and completion of the tradition. <span
id="fr_73"></span>[3](#fn_73.md) It is, therefore, in these two
collections, religiously preserved since their formation until this day
and united under the name of *Talmud*, <span
id="fr_74"></span>[4](#fn_74.md) that we must, above all, search, if not
for the very ideas which form the foundation of the Kabbalistic system,
at least, for some data on the origin and epoch of their birth.

In the Mishnah (Haggigah, Sec. II) we find this remarkable passage: "The
story of the Creation (Genesis) is not to be explained to two, the story
of the Merkaba (Heavenly Chariot)

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

not even to one, unless he be wise and can deduce wisdom of his own
accord. ‏אין דורשין לא במעשה בראשית בשנים ילא במרכבה ביחיד אלא אס כן חכם
ומבין מדעתו‪.‫‎

The Talmud (Haggigah, 13a) cites a Beraitha (a Mishnah not included in
the collection of R. Judah), where R. Hiya adds: "When the summaries of
the chapters may be transmitted to him." ‏מוסרים לו ראשי פרקים‎

A rabbi of the Talmud, R. Zerah (ibid) is still more severe, for he adds
that even the summaries of the chapters may be divulged only to men
clothed with high dignity, or <span id="fr_75"></span>[5](#fn_75.md) known
by their extreme prudence; or, to translate literally the original
expression, "who carry within them a heart full of solicitude." ‏אין
מוסרים ראשי פרקים אלא לאב בית דין ולכל מי שלבו דואג בקרבו‎

Evidently this can not refer to the text of Genesis or to that of
Ezekiel wherein the prophet tells of his vision on the banks of the
river Hebar. <span id="fr_76"></span>[6](#fn_76.md) The entire Scriptures
were, so to speak, in the mouth of everybody; from time immemorial, the
most scrupulous observers of all the traditions have made it their duty
to read them through in their temples at least once during the year.
Moses himself incessantly advised the study of the Law, by which the
Pentateuch is universally understood. After the return from the
Babylonian captivity, Ezra read it aloud before the assembled people
(Ezra, II, 8). It is just as impossible that the words quoted express
the interdiction to give any interpretation to the story of the creation
and to that of Ezekiel for the purpose of making them comprehensible to
oneself or to others; the question here is that of an interpretation, or
rather of a doctrine, which, although known, was taught under the seal
of mystery; of a science furnished with a fixed form as well as fixed

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

principles, since we know the manner of its division and since it is
shown to us divided into several chapters each one of which is headed by
a summary.

For it is to be noted, that Ezekiel's vision has nothing in common with
all this, because it fills not several chapters, but only one, and
precisely the one which is first in the works attributed to this
prophet. Moreover, we see that this secret doctrine comprised two parts
which have not been accorded equal importance; for the one part could
not be taught to two persons, while the other could not be divulged at
all, not even to one person, although he satisfied the severest
conditions imposed upon him. If we are to believe Maimonides--who,
although a stranger to the Kabbalah, could not deny its existence--the
first half, entitled "The Story of Genesis or of the Creation" (‏מעשה
בראשית‎) taught the science of Nature, the second half called "The Story
of the Chariot" (‏מעשה מרכבה‎) contained a treatise on theology. <span
id="fr_77"></span>[7](#fn_77.md) This opinion was also accepted by all the
Kabbalists. <span id="fr_78"></span>[8](#fn_78.md)

Here is another passage wherein the same fact is presented to us in a no
less evident manner. "One day R. Johanan said to R. Eliezer: 'Come, I
will teach thee the story of the Merkaba.' The latter replied: 'I am not
old enough for that.' When he became old, R. Johanan died, and some time
later R. Assi came to him and said: 'Come, I will teach thee the story
of the Merkaba.' R. Eliezer answered: 'Had I considered myself worthy, I
would have learned it from R. Johanan, thy Master'" (Haggiga, 12a). 'We
see by these words that, in order to be initiated into this mysterious
and sacred science, it was not

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

sufficient to be distinguished by intelligence and by eminent position,
one had to attain also an advanced age; and even when all these
conditions, equally observed by modern Kabbalists, <span
id="fr_79"></span>[9](#fn_79.md) were fulfilled, one was not always so sure
of his intelligence or moral force to accept the burden of these
formidable secrets, which were not absolutely without danger to the
positive belief and to the other observance of religious law.

Here is a curious example told by the Talmud itself, in an allegorical
language which it afterwards explains. "The teachers taught: Four
(persons) entered the garden of delight, namely: ben Azai, ben Zomah,
Aher and R. Akkiba. Ben Azai looked around and died. To him may be
applied the verse of the Scriptures: Precious <span
id="fr_80"></span>[10](#fn_80.md) in the sight of the Lord is the death of
his saints' (Psalm CXVI, 15). Ben Zoma also looked around and lost his
reason. The Scriptures say of (such as) him: 'Hast thou found honey, eat
so much as is sufficient for thee; lest thou be filled therewith and
vomit it' (Prov. XXV, 16). Aher made ravages in the plantations. Akkiba
entered in peace and came out in peace." <span
id="fr_81"></span>[11](#fn_81.md)

This passage can not possibly be taken literally, in the sense that it
refers to a material vision of the splendors of another life; for, above
all, the Talmud never uses the purely mystical terms of the text quoted
when speaking of Paradise. <span id="fr_82"></span>[12](#fn_82.md) For, how
can we admit that a man could lose either faith or reason, as it
happened to two of this legend, if, while still on earth, he had become
aware of the heavenly powers awaiting the elect? We must, therefore,
agree with the best reputed authorities of the

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Synagogue, that
the Garden of Delight entered by the four doctors, is nothing else but
the mysterious science spoken of before; <span
id="fr_83"></span>[13](#fn_83.md) a science dangerous to weak
intelligences, because it may lead them either to insanity or to errors
more fatal than impiety. It is this last result that the Gemara wishes
to indicate when it says in speaking of Aher, that he made ravages in
the plantations. It tells us that this person, so famous in Talmudic
narrations, was before this one of the wisest teachers in Israel; his
real name was Elishah ben Abuah, which was substituted by Aher to
indicate the change in him. <span id="fr_84"></span>[14](#fn_84.md) And, in
fact, when he issued from the allegorical garden into which his fatal
curiosity had led him, he became an open infidel. He abandoned himself,
says the text, to the generation of evil <span
id="fr_85"></span>[15](#fn_85.md) he lacked morals, betrayed his faith, led
a scandalous life, and some people even accused him of the murder of a
child. Where, really, is his first error to be found? Whither have his
researches into the most important secrets of religion led him? The
Jerusalem Talmud plainly states that he recognized two supreme
principles, <span id="fr_86"></span>[16](#fn_86.md) and the Babylonian
Talmud, from which we have taken the whole of this story, gives us to
understand the same thing. It informs us that when Aher saw in the
heavens the power of Metatron, the angel next to God, <span
id="fr_87"></span>[17](#fn_87.md) he exclaimed: "Perhaps there are, far be
it, two supreme powers." <span id="fr_88"></span>[18](#fn_88.md)

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

We need not dwell too long upon this portion of our subject, for we must
cite other, more significant facts; yet, we can not refrain from
remarking that the angel, or rather the hypostasis called Metatron,
plays a very great part in the Kabbalistic system. It is he, properly
speaking, who governs this visible world; he reigns over all the spheres
swinging in space, over all the planets and celestial bodies, as well as
over all the angels who conduct them; for above him is nothing but the
intelligible forms of the divine essence, and spirits, so pure, that
they can not exercise any immediate action over material things. It has
also been found that his name, interpreted in numbers (‏גימטריא‎) is no
less than the synonym of the All-Mighty. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[19](#fn_90.md)

The Kabbalah is undoubtedly, as we shall soon prove, much further
removed from dualism than from that which is nowadays called in a
neighboring country, the doctrine of absolute identity; yet, is not the
allegorical way in which it separates the intelligible essence of God
and the ruling power of the world able to explain to us the error
indicated by the Gemara?

Our last citation, drawn from the same source, and accompanied by
Maimonides' reflections, will, I hope, complete the demonstration of
this capital point, that a certain philosophy, a religious metaphysics
was, so to speak, orally taught among some of the Tannaim, or the most
ancient theologians of Judaism. The Talmud informs us that in earlier
days three names were known as the expressions of the idea of God,
namely, the famous tetragrammaton, or the name of four letters, and two
names foreign to the Bible. One of these two names was composed of
twelve letters, the other of forty-two. The first, though forbidden to
the majority, circulated freely enough inside the schools. "The

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

wise men," the text says, "taught it once a week to their sons and to
their disciples." <span id="fr_91"></span>[20](#fn_91.md)

The twelve-lettered name was originally still more widely known. "It was
imparted to everybody. But when the number of the impious multiplied, it
was entrusted to the most reticent among the priests, and these tried to
make it inaudible by the singing of their brethren, the priests." <span
id="fr_92"></span>[21](#fn_92.md) Finally, the name composed of forty-two
letters was looked upon as the most holy of the mysteries. <span
id="fr_93"></span>[22](#fn_93.md) "It was taught only to the one who was
discreet, of ripe age, neither high-tempered, nor immoderate, nor
stubborn, and who was gentle in his associations." <span
id="fr_94"></span>[23](#fn_94.md) "He who has been instructed in this
secret," adds the Talmud, "and guards it with vigilance and a pure
heart, may count on the love of God and on the favor of men; his name
inspires respect, his knowledge is protected against oblivion, and he
finds himself heir to two worlds, the world we now live in and the world
to come." <span id="fr_95"></span>[24](#fn_95.md)

Maimonides very ingeniously remarks that there is no name composed of
forty-two letters in any language, and that this would be still more
impossible in the Hebrew language where the vowels are not part of the
alphabet. He, therefore, thought himself justified in concluding that
the forty-two letters formed several words, each one of which expressed
a definite idea or a fundamental attribute of the Supreme Being, and
when taken all together, they formed the true definition of the divine
essence. <span id="fr_96"></span>[25](#fn_96.md) The statement, continues
the same author, that the name just spoken of embraced a study in
itself, and that the knowledge thereof was entrusted to the wisest only,
undoubtedly means that,

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

in order to define the essence of God, the peculiarity of God and of
things in general would either have to be better elucidated or further
developed. This is surely also the case with the four-lettered name;
for, how is it possible to suppose that a name so frequently met with in
the Bible, and to which the Bible itself gives the sublime definition of
"ego sum qui sum" was kept a secret which was imparted once a week by
the wise men into the ears of a few chosen disciples? That which the
Talmud calls the knowledge of the names of God, concludes Maimonides,
is, therefore, nothing but a small part of theology or metaphysics (‏קצת
חכמה אלהית‎) and it is for this reason that it has been said to be proof
against oblivion; for oblivion is not possible to ideas which have their
seat in active intelligence, that is, in reason. <span
id="fr_97"></span>[26](#fn_97.md)

It would be difficult not to yield to these reflections, recommended no
less by the common sense of the free-thinker, as well as by profound
science and the generally recognized authority of the Talmudists. <span
id="fr_98"></span>[27](#fn_98.md) We shall add here one more observation,
undoubtedly of very questionable importance in the eyes of common sense,
but which is not valueless to the order of ideas which these researches
bear, and which we shall be obliged to accept as an historical fact: By
counting all the letters that compose the Hebrew names, the sacred,
essential names of the ten Sefiroth of the Kabbalah, and by prefixing to
the last name of the Sefiroth the conjunctive particle "v" (‏ו‎)--as it
is done in all enumerations and in all languages--we obtain exactly the
number 42. <span id="fr_99"></span>[28](#fn_99.md) Is it not, therefore,
possible to think that this is the thrice holy name which even to the
elite of the wise men was

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

tremblingly confided? We would also find therein the full justification
for all the remarks made by Maimonides.

For, first of all, these forty-two letters do not really form one name,
as usually accepted, but several words. Then again, each one of these
words expresses, in the opinion of the Kabbalists at least, an essential
attribute of the divinity, or, what is the same thing to them, one of
the necessary forms of existence. Finally, all together represent,
according to the Kabbalistic science, according to the Zohar and all its
commentators, the most exact definition of the supreme principle of all
things that our minds are capable of conceiving. As such a concept of
God is separated by an abyss from common belief, all precautions taken
to prevent it from leaving the circle of initiates is very well
understood. We certainly shall not insist upon this point, the
importance of which, to say it again, we in no way exaggerate; we are
satisfied for the moment to have shown, even to the evidence, the
general result of the passages quoted.

At the time, then, when the Mishnah was edited, there existed a secret
doctrine on the Creation and the Divine Nature. The manner of its study
and division was agreed upon, and its name excited a kind of religious
terror even among those who could not have known it. But, for how long
had it existed? And if we can not determine with precision the date of
its birth, is there any way of telling when the deep shadows formed that
shrouded its origin? It is this question which we shall now attempt to
answer. In the opinion of the historians most worthy of our confidence,
the editing of the Mishnah came to an end no later than the year 3949 of
the creation, 189 years after the birth of Christ. <span
id="fr_100"></span>[29](#fn_100.md) We must also bear in mind that Judah
the Holy did but collect the precepts and traditions transmitted to him
by the Tannaim, his predecessors; the words cited at first by us, and
which forbid the imprudent delivery of the secrets of the Creation and
of the Merkaba, are, consequently, older than the book that

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

contains them. True, we do not know the author of these words, but this
in itself is further proof in favor of their antiquity; for, had they
expressed the opinion of one man only, they would not have been clothed
with legislative power, and, as is usually done under such
circumstances, the name of the person responsible for them would have
been mentioned.

Besides, the doctrine itself necessarily precedes the law that
interdicts its disclosure. It must have been known and must have
acquired already a certain authority before the danger of its
dissemination, not to say among the people, but among the doctors and
masters in Israel was recognized. So, without undue boldness, we may
date it, at least, from the end of the first century of the Christian
era. This is precisely the time when Akkiba and Simeon ben Yohai lived,
to whom the Kabbalists attribute the composition of their most important
and most celebrated works. In this generation must also be included R.
Jose of Zippora (‏ר׳ יוסי דצפור‎) whom the Idra Rabba--one of the most
ancient and most remarkable fragments of the Zohar--counts among the
intimate friends and most fervent disciples of Simeon ben Yohai. It is
evidently to him that the talmudic treatise, from which we have drawn
the majority of our citations, attributes a knowledge of the holy
Merkaba. <span id="fr_101"></span>[30](#fn_101.md) Among the number of
authorities who testify to the antiquity, if not of the books, at least
of the Kabbalistic ideas, we do not hesitate to count the Chaldaic
translation of the Five Books of Moses by Onkelos.

This famous translation was looked upon with such great respect, that it
was regarded as a divine revelation. The Babylonian Talmud (Tract.
Kidushin, 49a) supposes that Moses received it on Mount Sinai at the
same time when he received the written and oral law, that it came down
to the time of the Tannaim by tradition, and that Onkelos received but
the glory for transcribing it. A great many of the modern theologians
have

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

believed they have found in it the foundation of Christianity. They
maintained particularly that they had recognized the second divine
person in the word Memra (‏מימרא‎), which really signifies the "word,"
or the "thought," and which the translator has placed everywhere for the
name of Jehovah. <span id="fr_102"></span>[31](#fn_102.md)

This much is certain, that there rules in this translation a spirit
opposed to that of the Mishnah, of the Talmud, of common Judaism, and
even of the Pentateuch; in short, the traces of mysticism are not rare
there. Whenever it is only possible or of particular importance, an idea
is substituted for a fact or an image, the literal meaning is sacrificed
to the spiritual meaning, and anthropomorphism destroyed in order to
show the divine attributes in their nakedness.

At a time when the worship of the dead letter degenerated into idolatry;
at a time when men passed their lives in counting the verses, the words
and the letters of the Law; <span id="fr_103"></span>[32](#fn_103.md) at a
time when the official preceptors, the legitimate representatives of
religion, saw nothing better to do than to crush the intellect as well
as the will under an always increasing mass of external practices, that
aversion for everything material and positive, and the habit of often
sacrificing grammar and history to the interest of an exalted idealism,
infallibly reveal to us the existence of a secret doctrine which has all
the characteristics and all the pretensions of mysticism, and which,
undoubtedly, does not date from the day it dared to speak in a clear
language. Finally, without attaching too much importance to it, we can
not refrain from laying stress upon the following: We have already
remarked, that in order to attain their aims and to introduce, in some
manner, their own ideas into the very terms of the revelation, the
Kabbalists resorted at times to more or less irrational means. One of
these means, which consisted in forming a new alphabet

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

by changing the value of the letters, or better, by substituting one for
the other according to a definite order, is frequently employed in the
Talmud, and made use of in a translation older than the one just spoken
of, namely, the Aramaic paraphrase of Jonathan ben Uzziel, <span
id="fr_104"></span>[33](#fn_104.md) contemporary and disciple of Hillel the
Aged (‏הלל חזקן‎), who taught with great authority during the first
years of the reign of Herod. <span id="fr_105"></span>[34](#fn_105.md)

To be sure, such procedures may serve equivocally the most diverse
ideas; but men do not invent an artificial language, the key to which is
intentionally hidden, unless they have resolved to hide their thoughts,
if not from all, at least, from the mass of the people. Furthermore,
although the Talmud makes frequent use of similar methods, yet, the one
we describe and which we believe to be the oldest, is entirely strange
to it. Taken alone, this last fact would undoubtedly be of small
demonstrative power, but added to those which already occupied our
attention, it ought not to be disregarded. If we take them all together
and compare them with one another, we are justified in stating, that
there spread among the Jews, before the end of the first century of the
Christian era, a profoundly venerated science, distinct from the
Mishnah, the Talmud and the Sacred Books,--a mystic doctrine engendered
evidently by the need of reflection and of

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

independence, and I would even say, by the need of philosophy; and
which, nevertheless, invoked in its favor the united authority of
tradition and Scriptures.

The guardians of this doctrine, whom, from now on, we do not fear to
designate by the name of "Kabbalists," should not and can not be
confounded with the Essenes, whose name was already known at a much
earlier epoch, but who still preserved their customs and beliefs until
some time under the reign of Justinian. <span
id="fr_106"></span>[35](#fn_106.md) In fact, if we refer to Josephus, (De
Bello Jud., 8, I), and Philo, (De vita contemplativa, in his collected
works), the only ones deserving confidence on this point, the aim of
this famous sect was essentially a moral and practical one; it
endeavored to make dominant among men the kind of equality and brotherly
love which was later on taught with such glitter by the founder and
apostles of Christianity. The Kabbalah, on the other hand, was,
according to the oldest testimonies brought by us, entirely a
speculative science, which claimed to unveil the secrets of the Creation
and of the Divine Nature.

The Essenes formed an organized society, very similar to the religious
communities of the Middle Ages. Their outer life reflected their
feelings and their ideas, and, besides, they admitted into their midst
all those who distinguished themselves by a pure life, not excepting
even women and children. The Kabbalists have always shrouded themselves
in mysterious darkness, from the time of their first appearance to the
time when the press betrayed their secret. At rare intervals, and with
the greatest precaution, they opened their portals half-way for some new
adept who was always chosen only from among the select minds, and whose
advanced age warranted his discretion and wisdom. Finally, in spite of
the all too pharasaical rigidity of their observance of the sabbath, the
Essenes were certainly not afraid to reject publicly the traditions, to
give Morality a very conspicuous preference over Cult, and even to
retain in the latter

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

neither the sacrifice nor the ceremonies commanded by the Pentateuch.

Like the greater number of Christian mystics, and like the Karmathians
among the followers of Islam, the adepts of the Kabbalah followed all
the external practices; they were generally careful not to attack the
tradition which they themselves invoked in their favor.; and, as we have
already noted, several of them were counted among the most revered
doctors of the Mishnah. We may also add that later on they were seldom
found to be untrue to these habits of prudence.

called ‏נן עדן‎ (the Garden of Eden), or the World to Come (‏עולם הבא‎);
while here the word ‏פרדס‎ (Pardes) is used, which the modern Kabbalists
have also consecrated to their science.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[68:13](rph10.htm#fr_83.md) In hac Gemara neque
Paradisus neque ingredi ilium ad litteram exponendum est, sed potius de
subtili et coelesti cognitione, secundum quam magistri arcanum opus
currus intellexerunt, Deum ejusque palabra de Dios es su escritura; y la
consideration de Dios es su majestatem scrutando invenire cupiverunt.--;
Huttinger, Discur. Gemaricus, p. 97.)

<span id="fn_84"></span>[68:14](rph10.htm#fr_84.md) The literal meaning of
the word Aher (‏אחר‎) is another, another man.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[68:15](rph10.htm#fr_85.md) In the Talmud really:
‏נפק לתרבות רעה‎ or ‏יצא‎--Jellinek-

<span id="fn_86"></span>[68:16](rph10.htm#fr_86.md) ‏שחשב שיש שתי
רשויות‪.‫‎

<span id="fn_87"></span>[68:17](rph10.htm#fr_87.md) ‏מטטרון‎ is apparently
composed of the two Greek words μετὰ θρόνος. According to the
Kabbalists, the angel who bears this name really presides over the world
of Yetzirah, or the world of Spheres which comes immediately after the
world of pure spirits, the world Beriah, called the Throne of Glory,
(‏כסא חכבוד‎), or simply the Throne (‏כורסייא‎).

<span id="fn_88"></span>[68:18](rph10.htm#fr_88.md) ‏שמא הס ושלום שתי

the author, as coming nearer to the meaning of the original Hebrew
text.--Transl.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[69:19](rph10.htm#fr_90.md) The word Metatron
(‏מטטרון‎) like the word Shaddai (‏שדי‎) which is translated by
"Almighty," results in the number 314.

the author of the philosophic work entitled "Moreh Nebuhim," he has also
composed under the title of "The Strong Hand" (‏יד הזקה‎) a great
talmudical work which is to this day the indispensable manual of the
rabbis.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[74:32](rph10.htm#fr_103.md) Babyl. Talmud, Tract.
Kidushin, 30a. From this, according to the Talmudists, comes the word
‏סופר‎ which really means "to count," but which is translated by
"Scribe."

<span id="fn_104"></span>[75:33](rph10.htm#fr_104.md) We refer here to the
Kabbalistic alphabet called Ath Bash, ‏את בש,‎, because it consists in
giving to the first letter Aleph, ‏א‎, the value of the last letter
Thau, ‏ת‎, and again reciprocally, in replacing the second letter Beth,
‏ב‎, by the one before the last letter of the alphabet, the Shin, ‏ש‎,
and so on with the rest. By means of this procedure the Chaldaic
paraphrasist translates the name Sheshach, ‏ששר‎ (Jeremiah, LI, 41),
which gives no sense, by Babel, ‏בבל‎. In the same manner he translates
also ‏לב קמי‎ (ib. LI, 1) which means "the heart of my adversaries," by
‏כשדים‎, which signifies Chaldeans. It is supposed that the Hebrew
prophet, a captive in the empire of Babylon could not name it expressly
when threatening it with the vengeance of heaven. But such a supposition
becomes incomprehensible when, in the same chapter and under the
influence of the same sentiment, the names of Babel and Chaldeans are
often repeated. However, this translation was preserved by St. Jerome
(see his works, 5. IV, "Commentary on the Book of Jeremiah") and by
Rashi.
