### CHAPTER II

#### THE KABBALISTIC BOOKS

#### AUTHENTICITY OF THE SEFER YETZIRAH

We come now to the original books in which, according to the most
wide-spread opinion, the Kabbalistic system took form since its birth.
Judging from the titles <span id="fr_107"></span>[1](#fn_107.md) which have
come down to us, the books were very numerous. But we shall consider
only those which time has conserved for us, and which commend themselves
to our attention by their importance as well as by their antiquity.
There are two of the latter kind which fully correspond with the
conception which we can form of the "History of Genesis" and of the
"Holy Merkaba" according to the Talmud. One, entitled the "Book of
Formation," ‏ספר יזירה‎, contains, I do not say a system of physics, but
such a system of cosmology as could have been conceived in an epoch and
in a country where the habit of explaining all phenomena by an immediate
action of the first cause must have stifled the spirit of observation,
and

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

where, consequently, certain general and superficial relations perceived
in the external world, must have passed for the science of nature. The
other is called the Zohar, ‏זהר‎, or Brightness, according to the words
of Daniel: "And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
firmament." <span id="fr_109"></span>[2](#fn_109.md)

The Zohar treats more particularly of God, of spirits and of the human
soul, in a word, of the spiritual world. We are far from according the
same importance and the same value to these two works. The second, much
richer and much more extensive, but also more difficult, must, no doubt,
hold the most prominent place; but we shall begin with the first, which
seems to us to be the most ancient of the two.

Talmudic texts, of which neither the sense nor the age have been well
established, were invoked in favor of the antiquity of the Sefer
Yetzirah. We shall pass in silence these as well as the legends and the
controversies to which they give rise. Our observations will bear only
upon the foundation of the book which we aim to make known. They will
suffice to make the character appreciable and to demonstrate the lofty
origin.

1st. The system contained in it responds in every respect to the idea
conveyed by the title of the book. We are assured of the fact by the
words of the first proposition: "With the thirty-two marvelous paths of
wisdom the world was created by the Eternal, the Lord of Hosts, the God
of Israel, the Living, the Almighty, the Supreme God Who dwells in
Eternity, Whose name is sublime and holy."

2nd. The means employed there to explain the work of the creation and
the importance given to numbers and to letters, make us understand how
ignorance and [superstition](errata.htm#2.md) abused later this principle;
how the fables mentioned by us spread; and, finally, how the so-called
practical Kabbalah was formed, which gives to numbers and to letters the
power to change the course of nature.

The form is simple and grave; nothing that resembles, even

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

faintly, demonstration or argument; there are nothing but aphorisms
distributed in fairly regulated order, but as concise as the ancient
oracles. One striking fact is that the term which was later on used
exclusively for the designation of the soul, is still used here as in
the Pentateuch to designate the living human body. <span
id="fr_110"></span>[3](#fn_110.md)

True, there are several words of foreign origin in the book: The names
of the seven planets and the name of the Celestial Dragon, mentioned
several times in the book, belong, evidently, to the language as well as
to the science of the Chaldeans, who exercised an all-powerful influence
over the Hebrews during the Babylonian captivity. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[4](#fn_111.md) But the purely Greek, Latin and Arabic
expressions, seen in large numbers in the Talmud and in the more modern
writings where the Hebrew language serves philosophy and science, are
not found there.

Now, it may be admitted as a general, and I may almost dare say, as an
infallible principle, that all works of this nature wherein the
civilization of the Greeks and the Arabs take no part, may be regarded
as prior to the birth of Christianity. We surely admit that it would not
be difficult to find vestiges of the language and philosophy of
Aristotle in the work now under consideration,

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

and to which we attribute, without fear, this character. When, for
instance, after the above quoted proposition of the thirty-two marvelous
paths of Wisdom which served for the creation of the universe, it adds
that there are also three terms: that which counts, that which is
counted, and the very action of counting, translated by the oldest
commentators as: the subject, the object, and the act of the reflection
or the thought, <span id="fr_112"></span>[5](#fn_112.md) it is impossible
not to recall this celebrated phrase of the twelfth book of Metaphysics;
the intelligence comprehends itself by grasping the intelligible, and it
becomes the intelligible by the very act of comprehension and cognition;
so that the intelligence and the intelligible are identical. <span
id="fr_113"></span>[6](#fn_113.md)

But it is evident that these words were added to the text, for they are
connected neither with the proposition which precedes them, nor with the
one following them; they do not recur under any form in any other place
of the book; whereas the use of the ten numbers and the twenty-two
letters which form the thirty-two means applied to the creation by
divine wisdom, is explained at great length. Finally, we can not
understand how these words could find place in a treatise which deals
with nothing but the relations that exist between the different parts of
the material world. As to the difference in the two manuscripts
reproduced in the Mantua edition, one at the end of the volume, the
other amidst the diverse commentaries, they are far from being as great
as certain modern critics would have us believe. <span
id="fr_114"></span>[7](#fn_114.md)

After an impartial and detailed comparison, it is found to be

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

based entirely upon some unimportant variants such as may be met with in
all works of great antiquity, which suffered, by this very fact, during
several centuries from the inattention or from the temerity of
commentators. In fact, in both are found not only the same foundation
and the same system considered from a general point of view, but also
the same division and the same number of chapters, placed in the same
order and devoted to the same subject matter; what is more, the same
ideas are expressed in the same terms. But we do not find any more that
perfect similarity in the numbers and places of the diverse propositions
which, under the name of Mishnah, so clearly distinguish one from
another. Here repetitions, there abbreviations; here united what is
separated elsewhere. Finally, one appears also more explicit than the
other, not alone in the words, but in the meanings as well.

We do not know, and consequently can not cite, more than one passage
where the last difference is visible: At the end of the first chapter
where it is the question of enumerating the principles of the universe
which correspond to the ten numbers, one manuscript very simply says
that first of all comes the spirit of the Living God; the other adds
that this spirit of the Living God is the Holy Spirit which is, at the
same time, Spirit, Voice and Word. <span id="fr_115"></span>[8](#fn_115.md)
Doubtless this idea is of the greatest importance; but it is not lacking
in the manuscript where it is not so clearly formulated. It constitutes,
as we shall soon prove, the basis and the result of the entire system.
Moreover, the Book of Formation was translated and explained in Arabic
at the commencement of the tenth century, by Rabbi Saadia, a high
methodical and wise mind, who considered it one of the most ancient and
one of the first monuments of the human mind. <span
id="fr_116"></span>[9](#fn_116.md) Without according any exaggerated value
to this testimony, we shall add that all the

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

commentators who succeeded him during the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, expressed the same conviction.

Like all works of a very remote epoch, the one under consideration also
lacks the title as well as the name of the author; but it closes with
these strange words: "And when our father Abraham had considered,
examined, fathomed and grasped the meaning of all these things, the
Master of the Universe manifested Himself to him, called him His friend,
and entered into an eternal covenant with him and his posterity. Abraham
then believed in God, and that was counted unto him as a work of
justice; and the glory of God was called upon him; for it is to him that
these words apply: I have known thee before I formed thee in the womb of
thy mother." This passage can not be considered as a modern invention.
[With](errata.htm#3.md) only a few alterations it exists in the two texts
of the Mantua edition, and it is found in the oldest commentaries. It is
our opinion that in order to give more interest to the Book of
Formation, it was supposed, or it was desired to have others suppose,
that the things contained in the book were precisely those observed by
the first patriarch of the Hebrews, and which gave him the idea of a
God, One and All-Powerful.

There exists, besides, a tradition among the Jews, according to which
Abraham had great astronomical knowledge, and that he raised himself to
the idea of the true God solely by observing the spectacle of nature.
The words quoted above, nevertheless, have been interpreted in a most
gross material way. Abraham himself was taken as the author of the book
wherein his name is mentioned with religious respect. Moses Betril's
commentary on the Sefer Yetzirah begins thus: "It was Abraham, our
father (peace be upon him!) who wrote this against the wise men of his
time who were incredulous concerning the principles of Monotheism. This
is, at least, what R. Saadia (the memory of the just be blessed!)
believes in the first chapter of his book entitled "The Philosopher's
Stone." I give his own words: The wise men of Chaldea attacked Abraham,
our father, in his belief.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Now, the sages of
Chaldea were divided into three sects. The first sect pretended that the
Universe was subject to two primal causes which were entirely contrary
in their way of action; one was busy destroying what the other produced.
This opinion is that of the dualists who rest their theory on the
principle that there can be nothing in common between the author of good
and the author of evil. The second sect admitted three primal causes. As
the two contrary principles, of which we have spoken, reciprocally
paralyze each other, and as nothing can be accomplished in this manner,
they recognized a third, deciding, principle. The third sect, finally,
confessed no other God but the sun in which it recognized the sole
principle of life and death." (See Sefer Yetzirah, Mantua edition, p.
20, 21.)

Notwithstanding such an imposing and universally respected authority,
the opinion just noted has not even one adherent nowadays. The name of
the patriarch has long since been replaced by that of Akkiba, one of the
most fanatical champions of the tradition, one of the numerous martyrs
of his country's liberty, and one who would have been counted by
posterity among the heroes most worthy of admiration had he played a
part in the ancient republics of Athens and Rome.

This other opinion is, no doubt, less improbable than the first one;
yet, we surely do not believe it better based. Although, whenever
mentioning him, the Talmud represents Akkiba as an almost divine being,
and although it ranks him even above Moses, <span
id="fr_117"></span>[10](#fn_117.md) yet he is not presented in any place as
one of the luminaries of the Merkaba or of the science of Genesis;
nowhere are we led to surmise that he wrote the Book of Formation, or
any other book of that nature. On the contrary, he was positively
reproached for not having entertained very lofty ideas of the nature of
God. "Until when, Rabbi Akkiba," said Rabbi Jose the Galilean to him,
"until when will you continue to profane the Divine

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Majesty?" <span
id="fr_118"></span>[11](#fn_118.md) The enthusiasm he inspired was caused
by the importance he accorded to the tradition, by the patience with
which he knew how to draw from the traditions rules for all actions of
life, <span id="fr_119"></span>[12](#fn_119.md) by the zeal with which he
taught during a period of forty years, and, perhaps, also by the heroism
of his death. The twenty-four thousand disciples attributed to him do
not bear out the fact that the Mishnah forbade to divulge even the least
important secrets of the Kabbalah to more than one person.

Several modern critics have fancied that two different works were known
under the same title "Sefer Yetzirah;" one attributed to the patriarch
Abraham, has long since disappeared; the other, much more modern, is the
one conserved for us. This opinion is founded upon gross ignorance.
Morin, author of "Biblical Exercises," <span
id="fr_120"></span>[13](#fn_120.md) borrowed it from a chronicler of the
sixteenth century, who, speaking of Akkiba, said: "Akkiba is he who drew
up the Book of Formation in honor of the Kabbalah; but there is another
Book of Formation composed by Abraham, to which Rabbi Moses ben Nahman
(abbreviated, Ramban), wrote a great and marvelous commentary. <span
id="fr_121"></span>[14](#fn_121.md)

This commentary, written at the close of the thirteenth century, but
printed in the Mantua edition several years after the chronicle just
cited, <span id="fr_122"></span>[15](#fn_122.md) evidently relates to the
book now in our hands. Most of the expressions of the text are
faithfully preserved therein, and it is evident that it was not read by
the historian whose words we have cited. Besides, the first who wrote
the

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

name of Akkiba instead of the name of Abraham was a Kabbalist of the
fourteenth century, Isaac de Lattes, who in his preface to the Zohar
asked: "Who permitted Rabbi Akkiba to write the book which has been
orally transmitted since Abraham?" <span
id="fr_123"></span>[16](#fn_123.md) These words, which we have tried to
preserve faithfully, are evidently contrary to the distinction which we
wish to destroy; and, yet, this distinction rests, in the last instance,
on that authority only. So the author of the Book of Formation is as yet
not discovered; nor is it we who are to rend the veil which hides his
name. We even doubt whether this is possible with the feeble elements at
our disposal. But the uncertainty on this point to which we are
condemned, does not always reach the propositions which we think to have
demonstrated and which, if need be, may suffice to satisfy the purely
philosophical interest which we must look for in these matters.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_107"></span>[78:1](rph11.htm#fr_107.md) The Sefer Ha-Bahir,
‏ספר הבהיר‎, attributed to Nehunya Ben Hakanah, a contemporary of Hillel
the Aged and of Herod the Great, is frequently cited: and to this day
different fragments, evidently spurious, are quoted as from that work.
Such are also the fragments collected under the title of "The Faithful
Shepherd," ‏רעיא מהימנא‎, ordinarily printed with the Zohar as a
commentary. Otherwise, nothing has remained to us but names and a few
rare citations from the following authors frequently mentioned with the
greatest respect by the Zohar: Rabbi Jose the Elder, ‏ר׳ יוסי סבא.‎;
Rabbi Hamnuna the Elder, ‏ר׳ המנונא סבא.‎; and Rabbi Jebi the Elder, ‏ר׳
ייבי סבא.‎. <span id="fr_108"></span>[\*](#fn_108.md)

<span id="fn_108"></span>[78:\*](rph11.htm#fr_108.md) According to Peter
Beer, part 2, p. 28, also R. Kruspedai, ‏ר׳ כרוספדאי‎--Jellinek.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[79:2](rph11.htm#fr_109.md) Daniel, XII,
‏והמשכילים יזהירו בזהר הרקיע.‎.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[80:3](rph11.htm#fr_110.md) We refer here to the
word Nefesh, ‏נפש‎. It is evident that it can not be applied to the soul
in any of the following passages: 1, When it is said of those who,
according to the literal meaning of the word, "came out of the loins of
Jacob," ‏כל הנפש הבאה ליעקב מצרימה יצאי יריכן‎, Genesis XLVI, 26; 2,
When it is permitted to prepare on the first day of Passover only that
which every man must eat,‏את אשר יאכל לכל נפש היא לברו יעשה לבם‎ Exodus,
XII, 16; 3, When every one is ordered to inflict sufferings upon himself
on the tenth day of the seventh month, in expiation of his sins, ‏כל
הנפש אשר לא תענה בעצם היום הוה ונכרתה מעמיה‎, Levit. XXIII, 29. If it be
true that, in designating the soul, the word Neshamah, ‏נשמה‎, is used
in preference to Nefesh, yet the latter, at least, is never used by the
Talmudists or by more modern writers to designate the body. All, without
exception, make use of the word Guf, ‏גוף‎), which is not met with even
once in the Sefer Yetzirah.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[80:4](rph11.htm#fr_111.md) These names, excepting
those which designate the sun and the moon, do not belong to the
Chaldaic language; they are a translation of Chaldean names. They are:
‏נוגה‎, supposed to be Venus; ‏ככב‎, Mercury; ‏שבתאי‎, Saturn; ‏צדק‎,
Jupiter; ‏מאדים‎, Mars; ‏תלי‎, which designates the Dragon, is Arabic.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[81:5](rph11.htm#fr_112.md) ‏בג׳ ספרים בספר וספר
וסיפור‎, according to the author of the Cuzari, Rabbi Judah ha-Levi, the
three terms designate the Thought, the Word, and the Scriptures, which
in Divinity are identical, although in man they are separate. (Cuzari,
4th part.) According to Abraham ben Dior, they relate to the subject,
the object, and to the very act of knowledge, ‏דעת יזדע והידוע‎, or also
‏שכל משכייל ומושבל‎. See Abraham ben Dior's commentary to the Sefer
Yetzirah, p. 27a.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[81:6](rph11.htm#fr_113.md) Αὐτὸν δὲ νοεῖ ὁ νοῦς

<span id="fn_122"></span>[85:15](rph11.htm#fr_122.md) The first edition of
the Sefer Yetzirah is the Mantua edition published in 1565; while the
Chronicle, just mentioned, Shalsheleth hakabbalah (The Chain of
Tradition) was printed already in Imola in 1549.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[86:16](rph11.htm#fr_123.md) Isaac De Lattes
really combined both statements by saying:‏מי התיר לר׳ עקיבה לבתוב ספר
יצירה וקראהו משנה שהיתה שומה בפיהם בקבלה מאנרהם אבינו ע״ה ובא הרמב״ן
הנודע בשערים מהללן וחבר עלין פי׳ ארוד.‎ "Who permitted R. Akkiba to
write the book 'Sefer Yetzirah' which he called Mishnah and which they
received by way of tradition from Abraham our father (peace be upon
him!)? Why, again, came R. Moses ben Nahman, whose fame is so
wide-spread, and made an exhaustive commentary to it?"--Jellinek.
