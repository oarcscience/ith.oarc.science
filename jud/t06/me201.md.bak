# EXPLANATORY REMARKS

In our translation we adopted these principles:

1\. *Tenan* of the original--We have learned in a Mishna: *Tania*--We
have learned in a Boraitha; *Itemar*--It was taught.

2\. Questions are indicated by the interrogation point, and are
immediately followed by the answers, without being so marked.

3\. When in the original there occur two statements separated by the
phrase *Lishna achrena* or *Waïbayith Aema* or *Ikha d'amri* (literally,
"otherwise interpreted"), we translate only the second.

4\. As the pages of the original are indicated in our new Hebrew
edition, it is not deemed necessary to mark them in the English edition,
this being only a translation from the latter.

5\. Words or passages enclosed in round parentheses denote the
explanation rendered by Rashi to the foregoing sentence or word. Square
parentheses \[ \] contain commentaries by authorities of the last period
of construction of the Gemara.
