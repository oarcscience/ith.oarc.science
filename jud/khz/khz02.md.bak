### PART TWO

1\. AFTER this the Khazari, as is related in the history of the Khazars,
was anxious to reveal to his Vezier in the mountains of Warsān the
secret of his dream and its repetition, in which he was urged to seek
the God-pleasing deed. The king and his Vezier travelled to the deserted
mountains on the sea shore, and arrived one night at the cave in which
some Jews used to celebrate the Sabbath. They disclosed their identity
to them, embraced their religion, were circumcised in the cave, and then
returned to their country, eager to learn the Jewish law. They kept
their conversion secret, however, until they found an opportunity of
disclosing the fact gradually to a few of their special friends. When
the number had increased, they made the affair public, and induced the
rest of the Khazars to embrace the Jewish faith. They sent to various
countries for scholars and books, and studied the Tōrāh. Their
chronicles also tell of their prosperity, how they beat their foes,
conquered their lands, secured great treasures; how their army swelled
to hundreds of thousands, how they loved their faith, and fostered such
love for the Holy House that they erected a Tabernacle in the shape of
that built by Moses. They also honoured and cherished those born
Israelites who lived

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

among them. While the king studied the Tōrāh and the books of the
prophets, he employed the Rabbi as his teacher, and put many questions
to him on Hebrew matters. The first of these questions referred to the
names and attributes ascribed to God and their anthropomorphistic forms,
which are unmistakeably objectionable alike both to reason and to law.

2\. Said the Rabbi: All names of God, save the Tetragrammaton, are
predicates and attributive descriptions, derived from the way His
creatures are affected by His decrees and measures. He is called
*merciful*, if he improves the condition of any man whom people pity for
his sorry plight. They attribute to Him mercy and compassion, although
this is, in our conception, surely nothing but a weakness of the soul
and a quick movement of nature. This cannot be applied to God, who is a
just Judge, ordaining the poverty of one individual and the wealth of
another. His nature remains quite unaffected by it. He has no sympathy
with one, nor anger against another. We see the same in human judges to
whom questions are put. They decide according to law, making some people
happy, and others miserable. He appears to us, as we observe His doings,
sometimes a 'merciful and compassionate God,' (Exod. xxxiv. 6),
sometimes 'a jealous and revengeful God' (Nahum i. 2), whilst He never
changes from one attribute to the other. All attributes (excepting the
Tetragrammaton) are divided into three classes, viz. *creative*,
*relative* and *negative*. As regards the creative attributes, they are
derived from acts emanating from Him by ways of natural medium, e.g.
*making poor and rich*, *exalting or casting down*, '*merciful and
compassionate*,' '*jealous and revengeful*,' '*strong and* 

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

*almighty*,' and the like. As regards the *relative attributes*, viz.
'Blessed, praised, glorified, holy, exalted, and extolled,' they are
borrowed from the reverence given to Him by mankind. However numerous
these may be, they produce no plurality, as far as He is concerned, nor
do they affect his Unity. As regards the *negative* attributes, such as
'Living, Only, First and Last,' they are given to Him in order to
negative their contrasts, but not to establish them in the sense we
understand them. For we cannot understand life except accompanied by
sensibility and movement. God, however, is above them. We describe Him
as living in order to negative the idea of the rigid and dead, since it
would be an *a priori* conclusion that that which does not live is dead.
This cannot, however, be applied to the intellect. One cannot, e.g.
speak of time as being endowed with life, yet it does not follow that it
is dead, since its nature has nothing to do with either life or death.
In the same way one cannot call a stone ignorant, although we may say
that it is not learned. Just as a stone is too low to be brought into
connexion with learning or ignorance, thus the essence of God is too
exalted to have anything to do with life or death, nor can the terms
light or darkness be applied to it. If we were asked whether this
essence is light or darkness, we should say light by way of metaphor,
for fear one might conclude that that which is not light must be
darkness. As a matter of fact we must say that only material bodies are
subject to light and darkness, but the divine essence is no body, and
can consequently only receive the attributes of light or darkness by way
of simile, or in order to negative an attribute hinting at a deficiency.
Life

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

and death are, therefore, only applicable to material bodies, whilst the
divine essence is as much exempt from both as it is highly extolled
above them. The 'life' of which we speak in this connexion is not like
ours, and this is what I wish to state, since 'we cannot think of any
other kind of life but ours. It is as if one would say: We know not what
it is. If we say 'living God' and 'God of life' (Ps. cvi. 28), it is but
a relative expression placed in opposition to the gods of the Gentiles,
which are 'dead gods' from which no action emanates. In the same way we
take the term One, viz. to negative plurality, but not to establish
unity as we understand it. For we call a thing one, when the component
parts are coherent and of the same materials, e.g. one bone, one sinew,
one water, one air. In a similar way time is compared to a compact body,
and we speak of one day, and one year. The divine essence is exempt from
complexity and divisibility, and 'one' only stands to exclude plurality.
In the same way \[we style Him\] 'First' in order to exclude the notion
of any later origin, but not to assert that He has a beginning; thus
also 'Last' stands to repudiate the idea that His existence has no end,
but not to fix a term for Him. All these attributes neither touch on the
divine essence, nor do they lead us to assume a multiplicity. The
attributes which are connected with the Tetragrammaton are those which
describe His power of creating without any natural intermediaries, viz.
Creator, Producer, Maker, 'To Him who alone doeth great wonders (Ps.
cxxxvi. 4),' which means that \[He creates\] by His bare intention and
will, to the exclusion of any assisting cause. This is perhaps meant in
the word of the Bible: 'And I

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

appeared unto Abraham . . . as *El Shaddāi*' (Exod. vi. 3), viz. in the
way of power and dominion, as is said: 'He suffered no man to do them
wrong; yea, He reproved kings for their sake' (Ps. cv. 14). He did not,
however, perform any miracle for the patriarchs as He did for Moses,
saying: 'but my name J H W H was I not known to them' (Exod. 1. c). This
means by My name J H W H, since the bēth in beēl shaddāi refers to the
former. The wonders done for Moses and the Israelites left no manner of
doubt in their souls that the Creator of the world also created these
things which He brought into existence immediately by His will, as the
plagues of Egypt, the dividing of the Red Sea, the manna, the pillar of
a cloud, and the like. The reason of this was not because they were
higher than the Patriarchs, but because they were a multitude, and had
nourished doubt in their souls, whilst the patriarchs had fostered the
utmost faith and purity of mind. If they had all their lives been
pursued by misfortune, their faith in God would not have suffered.
Therefore they required no signs. We also style Him wise of heart,
because He is the essence of intelligence, and intelligence itself; but
this is no attribute. As to 'Almighty,' this belongs to the creative
attributes.

3\. Al Khazari: 'How dost thou explain those attributes which are even
of a more corporeal nature than those, viz. seeing, hearing, speaking,
writing the tablets, descending on mount Sinai, rejoicing in His works,
grieved in His heart.'

4\. The Rabbi: Did I not compare him with a just judge in whose
qualities no change exists, and from whose decrees result the prosperity
and good fortune of people, so that they say that he loves them and

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

takes pleasure in them? Others, whose fate it is to have their houses
destroyed and themselves be annihilated, would describe Him as filled
with hate and wrath. Nothing, however, that is done or spoken escapes
Him, 'He sees and hears'; the air and all bodies came into existence by
His will, and assumed shape by His command, as did heaven and earth. He
is also described as 'speaking and writing.' Similarly from the
aethereal and spiritual substance, which is called 'holy spirit,' arose
the spiritual forms called 'glory of God' (Exod. xix. 20).
Metaphorically He is called J H W H (ibid.) who descended on the mount
Sinai. We shall discuss this more minutely when treating on metaphysics.

5\. Al Khazari: Granting that thou hast justified the use of these
attributes, so that no idea of plurality need of necessity follow, yet a
difficulty remains as regards the attribute of Will with which thou dost
invest Him, but which the philosopher denies.

6\. The Rabbi: If no other objection is raised, except the Will, we will
soon vindicate ourselves. We say: O philosophers, what is it which in
thy opinion made the heavens revolve continually, the uppermost sphere
carrying the whole, without place or inclination in its movement, the
earth firmly fixed in the centre without support or prop; which
fashioned the order of the universe in quantity, quality, and the forms
we perceive? Thou canst not help admitting this, for things did neither
create themselves nor each other. Now the same adapted the air to giving
the sound of the Ten Commandments, and formed the writing engraved in
the tables, call it will, or thing, or what thou wilt.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

7\. Al Khazari: The secret of the attributes is now clear, and I
understand the meaning of 'The Glory of God,' 'Angel of God,' and
Shekhinah. They are names applied by the prophets to things perceptible,
as 'Pillar of Cloud,' 'Consuming Fire,' 'Cloud,' 'Mist, Fire,
Splendour,' as it is said of the light in the morning, in the evening,
and on cloudy days that the rays of light go forth from the sun,
although it is not visible. Yet we say that the rays of light are
inseparable from the sun, although in reality this is not so. It is the
terrestrial bodies which, being opposite to it, are affected by it, and
reflect its light.

8\. The Rabbi: Even so does the glory of God, which is only a ray of the
divine light, benefit His people in His country.

9\. Al Khazari: I understand what thou meanest by 'His people,' but less
intelligible is what thou sayest about 'His country.'

10\. The Rabbi: Thou wilt have no difficulty in perceiving that one
country may have higher qualifications than others. There are places in
which particular plants, metals, or animals are found, or where the
inhabitants are distinguished by their form and character, since
perfection or deficiency of the soul are produced by the mingling of the
elements.

11\. Al Khazari: Yet I never heard that the inhabitants of Palestine
were better than other people.

12\. The Rabbi: How about the hill on which you say that the vines
thrive so well? If it had not been properly planted and cultivated, it
would never produce grapes. Priority belongs, in the first instance, to
the people which, as stated before, is the essence and kernel \[of the
nations\]. In the second instance, it

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

would belong to the country\], on account of the religious acts
connected with it, which I would compare to the cultivation of the
vineyard. No other place would share the distinction of the divine
influence, just as no other mountain might be able to produce good wine.

13\. Al Khazari: How could this be? In the time between Adam and Moses
were not prophetic visions in other places granted to Abraham in Ur of
the Chaldaeans, Ezekiel and Daniel at Babylon, and Jeremiah in Egypt?

14\. The Rabbi: Whosoever prophesied did so either in the \[Holy\] Land,
or concerning it, viz. Abraham in order to reach it, Ezekiel and Daniel
on account of it. The two latter had lived during the time of the first
Temple, had seen the Shekhinah, through the influence of which each one
who was duly prepared became of the elect, and able to prophesy. Adam
lived and died in the land. Tradition tells us that in the cave \[of
Machpelāh\] were buried the four pairs: Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah,
Isaac and Rebeccah, Jacob and Leah. This is the land which bore the name
'before the Lord,' and of which it is stated that 'the eyes of the Lord
thy God are always upon it' (Deut. xi. 12). It was also the first object
of jealousy and envy between Cain and Abel, when they desired to know
which of them would be Adam's successor, and heir to his essence and
intrinsic perfection; to inherit the land, and to stand in connexion
with the divine influence, whilst the other would be a nonentity. Then
Abel was killed by Cain, and the realm was without an heir. It is stated
that 'Cain' went out of the presence of Lord (Gen. iv. 16), which means
that he left the land, saying: 'Behold, Thou hast driven me out this day

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

from the face of the earth, and from Thy face shall I be hid' (ib. v.
14). In the same way is it said: 'But Jonah rose up to flee unto
Tarshish from the presence of the Lord' (Jonah i. 3), but he only fled
from the place of prophecy. God, however, brought him back there out of
the belly of the fish, and appointed him prophet in the land. When Seth
was born he was like Adam, as it is said: 'He begat in his own likeness,
after his image' (Gen. v. 3), and took Abel's place, as it is said: For
God has appointed me another seed, instead of Abel, whom Cain slew (ib.
iv. 25). He merited the title: 'Son of God,' like Adam, and he had a
claim on the land, which is the next step to paradise. The land was then
the object of jealousy between Isaac and Ishmael, till the latter was
rejected as worthless, although it was said concerning him: 'Behold, I
have blessed him, and will multiply him exceedingly' (ib. xvii. 20) in
worldly prosperity; but immediately after it is said: 'My covenant will
I establish with Isaac' (v. 21), which refers to his connexion with the
divine influence and happiness in the world to come. Neither Ishmael nor
Esau could boast of a covenant, although they were otherwise prosperous.
Jealousy arose between [Jacob](errata.htm#1.md) and Esau for the birthright
and blessing, but Esau was rejected in favour of Jacob, in spite of his
strength and the latter's weakness. Jeremiah's prophecy concerning Egypt
was uttered in Egypt itself. This was also the case with Moses, Aaron
and Miriam. Sinai and Parān are reckoned as belonging to Palestine,
because they are on this side of the Red Sea, as it is said: 'And I will
set thy bounds from the Red Sea, even unto the sea of the Philistines,
and from the desert unto the river' (Exod. xxiii. 31). The 'desert' is
that of

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Parūn, 'that great
and terrible wilderness' (Deut. i. 19), being the southern border. 'The
fourth river is Euphrates' (Gen. ii. 14), designates the northern
border, where there were the altars of the Patriarchs, who were answered
by fire from heaven and the divine light. The 'binding' of Isaac took
place on a desolate mountain, viz. Moriah. Not till the days of David,
when it was inhabited, was the secret revealed that it was the place
specially prepared for the Shekhinah. Araunah, the Jebusite, tilled his
land there. Thus it is said: 'And Abraham called the name of the place,
*The Lord shall see*, as it is said to this day, in the mount of the
Lord it shall be seen' (ib. xxii. 14). In the Book of the Chronicles it
is stated more clearly that the Temple was built on mount Moriah. These
are, without doubt, the places worthy of being called the gates of
heaven. Dost thou not see that Jacob ascribed the vision which he saw,
not to the purity of his soul, nor to his belief, nor to true integrity,
but to the place, as it is said: 'How awful is this place' (ib. xxviii.
17). Prior to this it is said: 'And he lighted upon a certain place'
(ver. 11), viz. the chosen one. Was not Abraham also, and after having
been greatly exalted, brought into contact with the divine influence,
and made the heart of this essence, removed from his country to the
place in which his perfection should become complete? Thus the
agriculturer finds the root of a good tree in a desert place. He
transplants it into properly tilled ground, to improve it and make it
grow; to change it from a wild root into a cultivated one, from one
which bore fruit by chance only to one which produced a luxuriant crop.
In the same way the gift of prophecy was retained among Abraham's
descendants in Palestine,

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

the property of many as long as they remained in the land, and fulfilled
the required conditions, viz. purity, worship, and sacrifices, and,
above all, the reverence of the Shekhinah. For the divine influence, one
might say, singles out him who appears worthy of being connected with
it, such as *prophets and pious men*, and is their God. Reason chooses
those whose natural gifts are perfect, viz. *Philosophers* and those
whose souls and character are so harmonious that it can find its
dwelling among them. The spirit of life, pure and simple, is to be found
in beings which are endowed with ordinary primary faculties, and
particularly adapted to higher vitality--viz. *animals*. Finally,
organic life finds its habitat in a mixture of harmonious elements, and
produces--*plant*.

15\. Al Khazari: These are the general rules of a science which must be
classified. This does not concern us now, and I will ask thee about it
when we speak on the' subject. Continue thy discourse on the special
advantages of the Land of Israel.

16\. The Rabbi: It was appointed to guide the world, and apportioned to
the tribes of Israel from the time of the confusion of languages, as it
is said: 'When the Most High divided among the nations their
inheritance' (Deut. xxxii. 8). Abraham was not fit to gain the divine
influence, and to enter into a mutual compact, until he had, in
Palestine, made the covenant with Him 'between the pieces' (Gen. xv.
17). What is now thy opinion of a select community which has merited the
appellation 'people of God,' and also a special name called 'the
inheritance of God,' and of seasons fixed by Him, not merely agreed upon
or settled by astronomical calculations, and therefore styled "Sabbath
of the land"

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'feasts of the
Lord.' The rules regarding purity and worship, prayers and performances,
are fixed by God, and therefore called 'work of God' and 'service of the
Lord.'

17\. Al Khazari: In such an arrangement the 'glory of God' was bound to
become apparent.

18\. The Rabbi: Dost thou not see that even the land was given its
Sabbaths, as it is said: 'Sabbath of the land' (Lev. xxv. 6), and 'The
land shall keep a Sabbath unto the Lord' (ibid. 2). It is forbidden to
sell it for ever, as it is said: 'For Mine is the land' (ver. 23).
Observe that the 'feasts of the Lord' and the 'Sabbaths of the land'
belong to the 'land of the Lord.'

19\. Al Khazari: Was not the day primarily calculated as dawning first
in China, because it forms the eastern commencement of the inhabited
earth?

20\. The Rabbi: The beginning of the Sabbath must be calculated from
Sinai, or rather Alush, where the Mannah first descended. Consequently
Sabbath does not come in till the sun has set behind Sinai, and so on to
the remote west, and round the globe to China, which is the extreme end
of the inhabited earth. Sabbath begins in China eighteen hours later
than in Palestine, since the latter lies in the centre of the world.
Sunset in Palestine, therefore, concurs with midnight in China, and
midday in Palestine concurs with sunset in China. This is the problem of
the system based on the *eighteen hours* in the \[Talmudical\] rule: If
the conjunction of the moon takes place before midday, the new moon
becomes visible near sunset.

This refers to Palestine, the place where the law was given, and where
Adam at the end of Sabbath was transferred from paradise. It is there
where the

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

calendar began after the six days of creation. Adam, then, began to name
the days, as he did with all that dwelt on earth, and the following
generations continued counting in the same way. This is the reason why
there is no difference among mankind about the seven days of the week,
which commenced at the hour when the inhabitants of the extreme west
held noon. This was the hour of sunset for Palestine, and at this moment
the first light was created, the sun being created later on. This first
light was but an illumination, which soon passed away, leaving the world
in darkness. The established order was then that night preceded day, as
it is written: 'It was evening and it was morning.' In the same manner
the Tōrāh ordained: 'From evening unto evening' (Lev. xxiii. 32). Do not
quote against me those recent astronomers, the thieves of science,
though their theft was unintentional. They found, however, their science
in a precarious condition, since the eye of prophecy was stricken with
blindness; so they had recourse to speculation, and composed books on
the strength of it. In contradistinction to the Tōrāh, they considered
China as the original home of the calculation of the days. The contrast
is not, however, complete, because they agree with the Jewish theory in
assuming the beginning of the break of the day to have taken place in
China. The difference between our theory and theirs consists chiefly in
the circumstance that we count the night before the day. The 'eighteen'
hours must, consequently, be made the basis of the nomination of the
days of the week. For there are six hours between Palestine, where the
nomination of the days began, and the place of the sun at the time when
nomination

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

began. Thus the name of Sabbath, e.g. was employed for the beginning of
the day on which the sun rose for the extreme west, whilst it set for
Adam in Palestine. It kept the name 'beginning of Sabbath' till the sun
culminated for him eighteen hours later, when it was evening in China,
and also beginning of the Sabbath. This was the extreme limit for the
day to be called Sabbath, because the region further on is only called
east of the place where the days began to be counted. A place must,
however, exist which is at the same time extreme west and the beginning
of east. This is, for Palestine, the beginning of the inhabited world,
not only from the point of view of the law, but also from that of
natural science. For it would be impossible for the days of the week to
have the same names all over the world unless we fix one place which
marks the beginning, and another one not far off, not that the one be
merely an eastern point for the other, but that the one should be east
absolute, and the other west absolute. If this were not so the days
could not have definite names, since every point of the equator can be
east or west at the same time. China would thus be east for Palestine,
but west for the antipodal side. The latter would be east for China, but
west for \[what we call\] west, and the last-named would be east for the
antipodal side, but west for Palestine, and there would be neither east,
nor west, nor beginning, nor end, nor definite names for the days. Adam,
however, did give definite names to the days, taking Palestine for his
starting-point, but each name spreads over a certain geographical
latitude, because it is impossible to fix the horizon for every single
point on earth Jerusalem itself would have many east and west points;

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

the east of Zion would not be also the east of the Temple, and their
horizons, strictly speaking, different, though not noticeable to the
eye. This would be the case in a greater degree between Damascus and
Jerusalem, and we could not deny that in the former place Sabbath
commenced earlier than it does in the latter, and in Jerusalem sooner
than it does in Egypt. A certain latitude must, therefore, be allowed.
But the latitude in which differences in the nomination of the day
become apparent amounts to eighteen hours, neither more nor less. The
inhabitants of one meridian still call the day Sabbath, whilst those of
another are past it, and so on till eighteen hours after the time when
the Sabbath began, and the sun culminated in Jerusalem. It is then when
the name Sabbath comes to an end. Therefore no one exists who would call
the day Sabbath, but uses the name of the next day. This is meant by the
words: If the conjunction takes place before noon, it is understood that
the new moon is visible at sunset. In other words: If the Mōlād takes
place before noon on the Sabbath in Jerusalem, it is understood that the
new moon is visible on the Sabbath at sunset. This is because the name
Sabbath is retained for eighteen hours after the reason for so calling
it had departed from the place where it had begun, and the sun a day and
a night later culminates again in Palestine. The new moon is, therefore,
bound to appear at the eastern border of China in the twilight of the
Sabbath. This agrees with the rule of the sages: A night and a day are
reckoned to the month. The name Sabbath gives place everywhere to
Sunday, although Palestine had before that left Sabbath, and was in the
midst of Sunday. The intention of \[this

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

rule\] was that the name of the same day of the week should hold good
all over the world, and the question could be put both to the
inhabitants of China and the West: 'On which day did you celebrate the
New Year?' The answer would be: 'On Sabbath.' This notwithstanding that
the latter people had finished the feast, whilst the former, according
to the geographical position of their country towards Palestine, were
still celebrating it. With regard to the name of the days of the week,
they had both kept the same day.

Thus does the knowledge of the '*Sabbath of the Lord*' and the
'*Festivals of the Lord*' depend upon the land which is the 'inheritance
of the Lord,' and has, as thou didst read, the other names of 'His holy
mountain' (Ps. xcix. 9,), 'His footstool,' *ib*. 5 'Gate of heaven'
(Gen. xxviii. 7). For the law shall go forth from Zion' (Micah iv. 2).
\[Thou didst also read\] how the Patriarchs endeavoured to live in the
country whilst it was in the hands of the pagans, how they yearned for
it, and had their bones carried into it, as did Jacob and Joseph. Moses
prayed to see it, and when this was denied to him, he considered it a
misfortune. Thereupon it was shown to him from the summit of Pisgah,
which was to him an act of grace. Persians, Indians, Greeks, and
children of other nations begged to be allowed to offer up sacrifices,
and to be prayed for in the holy Temple; they spent their wealth at the
place, though they believed in other laws not recognized by the Tōrāh.
They honour it to this day, although the Shekhinah no longer appears
there. All nations make pilgrimages to it, long for it, excepting we
ourselves, because we are punished and in disgrace.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> All the Rabbis
tell of its great qualities would take too long to relate.

21\. Al Khazari: Let me hear a few of their observations.

22\. The Rabbi: One sentence is: All roads lead up to Palestine, but
none from it. Concerning a woman who refuses to go there with her
husband, they decreed that she is divorced, and forfeits her marriage
settlement. On the other hand, if the husband refuses to accompany his
wife to Palestine, he is bound to divorce her and pay her settlement.
They further say: It is better to dwell in the Holy Land, even in a town
mostly inhabited by heathens, than abroad in a town chiefly peopled by
Israelites; for he who dwells in the Holy Land is compared to him who
has a God, whilst he who dwells abroad is compared to him who has no
God. Thus says David: 'For they have driven me out this day from abiding
in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other gods' (1 Sam.
xxvi. 19), which means that he who dwells abroad is as if he served
strange gods. To Egypt they ascribed a certain superiority over other
countries on the basis of a syllogism in the following way: If Egypt,
with regard to which a covenant was made, is a forbidden land, other
countries are still more so. Another saying is: To be buried in
Palestine is as if buried beneath the altar. They praise him who is in
the land more than him who is carried thither dead. This is expressed
thus: He who embraces it when alive is not like him who does so after
his death. They say concerning him who could live there, but did not do
so, and only ordered his body to be carried thither after his death:
While you lived you made

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mine inheritance
an abomination, but in death 'you come and contaminate my country' (Jer.
ii. 1). It is told that R. Hananyah, when asked whether it was lawful
for a person to go abroad in order to marry the widow of his brother,
said: His brother married a pagan woman; praised be God who caused him
to die; now this one follows him The sages also forbade selling estates
or the remains of a house to a heathen, or leaving a house in ruins.
Other sayings are: Fines can only be imposed in the land itself; no
slave must be transported abroad, and many similar regulations. Further,
the atmosphere of the Holy Land makes wise. They expressed their love of
the land as follows: He who walks four yards in the land is assured of
happiness in the world to come, R. Zērā said to a heathen who criticized
his foolhardiness in crossing a river without waiting to reach a ford,
in his eagerness to enter the land: How can the place which Moses and
Aaron could not reach, be reached by me?

23\. Al Khazari: If this be so, thou fallest short of the duty laid down
in thy law, by not endeavouring to reach that place, and making it thy
abode in life and death, although thou sayest: 'Have mercy on Zion, for
it is the house of our life,' and believest that the Shekhinah will
return thither. And had it no other preference than that the Shekhinah
dwelt there five hundred years, this is sufficient reason for men's
souls to retire thither and find purification there, as happens near the
abodes of the pious and the prophets. Is it not 'the gate of heaven '?
All nations agree on this point. Christians believe that the souls are
gathered there and then lifted up to heaven. Islām teaches that it is
the

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

place of the *ascent*, and that prophets are caused to ascend from there
to heaven, and, further, that it is the place of gathering on the day of
Resurrection. Everybody turns to it in prayer and visits it in
pilgrimage. Thy bowing and kneeling in the direction of it is either
mere appearance or thoughtless worship. Yet your first forefathers chose
it as an abode in preference to their birth-places, and lived there as
strangers, rather than as citizens in their own country. This they did
even at a time when the Shekhinah was yet visible, but the country was
full of unchastity, impurity, and idolatry. Your fathers, however, had
no other desire than to remain in it. Neither did they leave it in times
of dearth and famine except by God's permission. Finally, they directed
their bones to be buried there.

24\. The Rabbi: This is a severe reproach, O king of the Khazars. It is
the sin which kept the divine promise with regard to the second Temple,
viz.: Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion' (Zech. ii. 10), from being
fulfilled. Divine Providence was ready to restore everything as it had
been at first, if they had all willingly consented to return. But only a
part was ready to do so, whilst the majority and the aristocracy
remained in Babylon, preferring dependence and slavery, and unwilling to
leave their houses and their affairs. An allusion to them might be found
in the enigmatic words of Solomon: I sleep, but my heart waketh (Song v.
2-4). He designates the exile by *sleep*, and the continuance of
prophecy among them by the wakefulness of the heart. 'It is the voice of
my beloved that knocketh' means God's call to return; 'My head is filled
with dew' alludes to the Shekhinah which emerged from the shadow of the
Temple. The words: 'I have put off

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

my coat,' refer to the people's slothfulness in consenting to return.
The sentence: 'My beloved stretcheth forth his hand through the opening'
may be interpreted as the urgent call of Ezra, Nehemiah, and the
Prophets, until a portion of the people grudgingly responded to their
invitation. In accordance with their mean mind they did not receive full
measure. Divine Providence only gives man as much as he is prepared to
receive; if his receptive capacity be small, he obtains little, and much
if it be great. Were we prepared to meet the God of our forefathers with
a pure mind, we should find the same salvation as our fathers did in
Egypt. If we say: 'Worship his holy hill--worship at His footstool--He
who restoreth His glory to Zion' (Ps. xcix. 9, 5), and other words, this
is but as the chattering of the starling and the nightingale. We do not
realise what we say by this sentence, nor others, as thou rightly
observest, O Prince of the Khazars.

25\. Al Khazari: Enough on this subject. Now I should like an
explanation of what I read about the sacrifices. Reason cannot accept
such expressions as: My offering, My bread for My sacrifices made by
fire, 'for a sweet savour unto Me' (Num. xxviii. 2), employed in
connexion with the sacrifices, describing them as being God's offering,
bread, and incense.

26\. The Rabbi: The expression: *By My fires* removes all difficulty. It
states that offering, bread and sweet savour, which are ascribed to Me,
in reality belong to My fires, i.e. to the fire which was kindled at
God's behest, and fed by the offerings. The remaining pieces were food
for the priests. The deeper signification of this was to create a well
arranged system, upon which the King should rest in an exalted, but not
local

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

sense. As a symbol of the Divine Influence, consider the reasoning soul
which dwells in the perishable body. If its physical and nobler
faculties are properly distributed and arranged, raising it high above
the animal world, then it is a worthy dwelling for King Reason, who will
guide and direct it, and remain with it as long as the harmony is
undisturbed. As soon, however, as this is impaired, he departs from it.
A fool may imagine that Reason requires food, drink, and scents, because
he sees himself preserved as long as these are forthcoming, but would
perish if deprived of them. This is not the case. The Divine Influence
is beneficent, and desirous of doing good to all. Wherever something is
arranged and prepared to receive His guidance, He does not refuse it,
nor withhold it, nor hesitate to shed light, wisdom, and inspiration on
it. If, however, the order is disturbed, it cannot receive this light,
which is, then, lost. The Divine Influence is above change or damage.
All that is contained in the 'order of sacrificial service,' its
proceedings, offerings, burning of incense, singing, eating, drinking,
is to be done in the utmost purity and holiness. It is called: 'Service
of the Lord,' 'the bread of thy God' (Num. viii. 11; Lev. xxi. 8), and
similar terms which relate to his pleasure in the beautiful harmony
prevailing among the people and priesthood. He, so to say, accepts their
hospitality and dwells among them in order to show them honour. He,
however, is most Holy, and far too exalted to find pleasure in their
meat and drink. It is for their own benefit, as is also the proper
working order of the digestion in the stomach and liver. The nobler
ingredients of the food go to strengthen the heart; the best of all, the
spirit. Not only are heart, mind, and brain regenerated by means of this

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

food, but also the digestive organs and all other organs through the
strengthening matter which reaches them through the arteries, nerves and
sinews. Altogether, this is so arranged and prepared, as to become fit
to receive the guidance of the reasoning soul, which is an independent
substance, and nearly approaches the angelic, of which it is stated:
'Its dwelling is not with flesh' (Dan. ii. 11). It inhabits the body as
ruler and guide, not in the sense of space, nor does it partake of this
food, because it is exalted above it. The Divine Influence only dwells
in a soul which is susceptible to intellect, whilst the soul only
associates with the warm vital breath. The latter must needs have a
mainspring to which it is attached, as is the flame to the top of the
wick. The heart is compared to the wick, and is fed by the flow of
blood. Blood is produced by the digestive organs, and therefore requires
the stomach, the liver, and lower organs. The heart, in the same way,
requires the lungs, throat, nose, the diaphragm, and the muscles which
move the muscles of the chest for breathing, as well as to keep in
balance the temperature of the heart between the air which enters, and
that which is expelled. It further requires for the removal of the food,
refuse expelling forces, viz. the excretory and urinary organs. In this
way the body is formed from all the component parts mentioned. It also
requires organs of motion from place to place, in order to procure its
wants, to avoid that which is harmful, and to attract and to repel. It
requires hands and feet, advisers who distinguish, warning against what
is to be feared, and advising what is to be hoped for; who keep account
of what has taken place, and record what has passed, in order to
recommend care or hope for future events.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It requires the
internal and external senses, the seat of which is in the head, and
which are assisted by the functions of the heart. The whole body is thus
harmoniously arranged, but under the control of the heart, which forms
the primary home of the soul. Its localization in the brain is of
secondary importance, the heart remaining its regulator. In exactly the
same way is the living, godly people arranged, as Joshua said: 'Hereby
shall ye know that the living God is among you' (iii. 10). The fire was
kindled by the will of God, when the people found favour in His sight,
being a sign that He accepted their hospitality and their offerings. For
the fire is the finest and noblest element beneath the sphere of the
moon. Its seat is the fat and vapour of sacrifices, the smoke of the
incense and oil, as it is the nature of fire to cling to fat and oil. So
also does natural heat cling to the finest fatty globules of the blood.
God commanded the construction of the altar burnt offerings, the Altar
of Incense, and the candlestick; their holocausts, incense, and the lamp
oil. As regards the altar of burnt offerings, it was destined to bear
the visible fire, whilst the Golden Altar was reserved for the invisible
and finer fire. The candlestick was to bear the light of wisdom and
inspiration; the table that of abundance and material provisions. The
sages say: He who wishes to be wise must turn to the south; he who
wishes to be rich must turn to the north. All these implements stood in
the service of the Holy Ark and the Cherubim which occupied the place of
the heart, and the lungs above it. The vessels, such as the laver and
its foot, tongs, firepans, dishes, spoons, bowls, pots, and forks, etc.,
were all required. A place was wanted to house them, viz. the
Tabernacle,

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

tent and cover, and the court of the Tabernacle with its appurtenances,
as an enclosure for the whole. As bearers of the entire household God
appointed the Levites, because they were nearest to Him, especially
after the affair of the golden calf, as it is said: 'And all the sons of
Levi gathered themselves together unto Him' (Exod. xxxii. 26). From
among them He chose Elazar, the finest and noblest of them, as it is
said: 'And to the office of Elazar the son of Aaron the priest
\[pertaineth\] the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the
daily meat offering, and the anointing oil' (Numb. iv. 16)--things to
which the finer fire clings. The light of wisdom, however, and
inspiration was attached to the *Urim* and *Tummim*, as well as to the
most select section of Levites, viz. the family of Kohāth, who carried
the appurtenances of the internal service: the Ark, Table, Candlestick,
Altars, and the Holy Vessels 'with which they served.' With regard to
them it is said: 'Because the service of the sanctuary belonged unto
them, they should bear upon their shoulders' (Num. vii. 9)--just as the
internal organs of the body are without bones which help to carry them,
but are, themselves, borne by the innate powers in conjunction with all
that belongs to them. Another branch of the children of Gershōn bore the
more delicate external appurtenances, viz. the carpets of the
Tabernacle, the Tent and its cover, and the covering of badgers’ skin
that was above it. The lower section of the B’nē Merāri bore the grosser
utensils, viz. its hooks, boards, bars, pillars, and sockets. The last
two sections were aided in carrying their burden by having chariots, as
it is said: 'Two wagons for the Gershoni and four wagons for Merāri
according to their service' (Num. vii. 7-8). All this was systematically
arranged

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

by God. I do not, by any means, assert that the service was instituted
in the order expounded by me, since it entailed something more secret
and higher, and was based on a divine law. He who accepts this
completely without scrutiny or argument, is better off than he who
investigates and analyses. He, however, who steps down from the highest
grade to scrutiny, does well to turn his face to the latent wisdom,
instead of leading it to evil opinions and doubts which lead to
corruption.

27\. Al Khazari: Rabbi, thy symbolization was excellent, but the head
and its senses, as well as the anointing oil were left unconsidered.

28\. The Rabbi: Quite so. The root of all knowledge was deposited in the
Ark which took the place of the heart, viz. the Ten Commandments, and
its branch is the Tōrāh on its side, as it is said: 'Put it in the side
of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God' (Deut. xx)d. 26). From
there went forth a twofold knowledge, firstly, the scriptural knowledge,
whose bearers were the priests; secondly, the prophetic knowledge which
was in the hands of the prophets. Both classes were, so to speak, the
people's watchful advisers, who compiled the chronicles. They,
therefore, represent the head of the people.

29\. Al Khazari: So you are to-day a body without either head or heart.

30\. The Rabbi: Thou sayest rightly, but we are not even a body, only
scattered limbs, like the 'dry bones' which Ezekiel saw \[in his
vision\] (chap. xxxvii.). These bones, however, O king of the Khazars,
which have retained a trace of vital power, having once been the seat of
a heart, brain, breath, soul, and intellect, are better than certain
bodies formed of marble and plaster, endowed

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

with heads, eyes, ears, and all limbs, in which never dwelt the spirit
of life, nor ever can dwell in them, since they are but imitations of
man, not man in reality.

31\. Al Khazari: It is as thou sayest.

32\. The Rabbi: The 'dead' nations which desire to be held equal to the
'living' people can obtain nothing more than an external resemblance.
They built houses for God, but no trace of Him was visible therein. They
turned hermits and ascetics in order to secure inspiration, but it came
not. They, then, deteriorated, became disobedient, and wicked; yet no
fire fell down from heaven upon them, nor rapid pestilence, as a
manifest punishment from God for their disobedience. Their heart, I mean
the house in which they used to meet, was destroyed, but otherwise their
status was not affected. This could only take place in accordance with
the largeness or smallness of their number, with their strength or
weakness, disunion or unity, following upon natural or accidental
causes. We, however, since our heart, I mean the Holy House, was
destroyed, were lost with it. If it be restored, we, too, will be
restored, be we few or many, or in whichever way this may happen. For
our master is the living God, our King, Who keeps us in this our present
condition in dispersion and exile.

33\. Al Khazari: Certainly. A similar dispersion is not imaginable in
any other people, unless it became absorbed by another, especially after
so long a period. Many nations which arose after you have perished
without leaving a memory, as Edōm, Mōāb, Ammōn, Aran, the Philistines,
Chaldaeans, Medians, Persians, and Javān, the Brahmans, Sabaeans, and
many others.

34\. The Rabbi: Do not believe that I, though agreeing

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

with thee, admit that we are dead. We still hold connexion with that
Divine Influence through the laws which He has placed as a link between
us and Him. There is circumcision, of which it is said: 'My covenant
shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant' (Gen. xvii. 13).
There is further the Sabbath, 'It is a sign between me and you
throughout your generations' (Exod. xxxi. 13). Besides this there is
'the covenant of the Fathers,' and the covenant of the law, first
granted on Hōreb, and then in the plains of Moab in connexion with the
promises and warnings laid down in the section:

When thou shalt beget children and grandchildren' (Deut. iv. 25).
Compare further the antithesis: 'If any of thine be driven out unto the
utmost parts of heaven' (chap. xxx. 10); 'Thou shalt return unto the
Lord thy God' (ibid. 2), finally, the song: 'Give ear' (chap. xxxii. 1);
and other places. We are not like dead, but rather like a sick and
attenuated person who has been given up by the physicians, and yet hopes
for a miracle or an extraordinary recovery, as it is said: 'Can these
bones live?' (Ezek. xxxvii. 3). Compare also the simile in the words:
'Behold my servant shall prosper'; 'He has no form nor comeliness,'
'Like one from whom men hid their faces' (Is. lii. 13; which means that
he is, on account of his deformity and repulsive visage, compared to an
unclean thing, which man only beholds with disgust, and turns away;
'Despised and rejected of men,' 'A man of sorrows and acquainted with
grief' liii. 3).

35\. Al Khazari: How can this serve as a comparison for Israel, as it is
said: 'Surely he has borne our griefs?' That which has befallen Israel
has come to pass on account of its sins.

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

36\. The Rabbi: Israel amidst the nations is like the heart amidst the
organs of the body; it is at one and the same time the most sick and the
most healthy of them.

37\. Al Khazari: Make this a little clearer.

38\. The Rabbi: The heart is exposed to all sorts of diseases, and
frequently visited by them, such as sadness, anxiety, wrath, envy,
enmity, love, hate, and fear. Its temperament changes continually,
undulating between excess and deficiency, and moreover influenced by
inferior nourishment, by movement, exertion, sleep, or wakefulness. They
all affect the heart whilst the limbs rest.

39\. Al Khazari: Now I understand how it can be the most sick and most
healthy of all organs simultaneously.

40\. The Rabbi: Is it possible that it could suffer from swelling, or a
cancer, or boils, a wound, weakness, and asthma, as is possible in other
organs?

41\. Al Khazari: Impossible. For the smallest trace of these would bring
on death. Its extreme sensibility, caused by the purity of its blood,
and its great intelligence causes it to feel the slightest symptom, and
expels it as long as it is able to do so. The other organs lack this
fine sensibility, and it is therefore possible that they can be affected
by some strange matter which produces illness.

42\. The Rabbi: Thus its sensibility and feeling expose it to many ills,
but they are at the same time the cause of their own expulsion at the
very beginning, and before they have time to take root.

43\. Al Khazari: Quite so.

44\. The Rabbi: Our relation to the Divine Influence

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

is the same as that of the soul to the heart. For this reason it is
said: 'You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore
I will punish you for all your inquities' (Amos iii. 2). These are the
illnesses. As regards its health, it is alluded to in the words of the
sages: He forgives the sins of his people, causing the first of them to
vanish first. He does not allow our sins to become overwhelming, or they
would destroy us completely by their multitude. Thus he says: 'For the
iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full' (Gen. xv. 16). He left them
alone till the ailment of their sins had become fatal. Just as the heart
is pure in substance and matter, and of even temperament, in order to be
accessible to the intellectual soul, so also is Israel in its component
parts. In the same way as the heart may be affected by disease of the
other organs, viz. the lusts of the liver, stomach and genitals, caused
through contact with malignant elements; thus also is Israel exposed to
ills originating in its inclinings towards the Gentiles. As it is said:
'They were mingled among the heathens and learned their works' (Ps. cvi.
35). Do not consider it strange if it is said in the same sense:
'Surely, he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows' (Is. liii. 4).
Now we are burdened by them, whilst the whole world enjoys rest and
prosperity. The trials which meet us are meant to prove our faith, to
cleanse us completely, and to remove all taint from us. If we are good,
the Divine Influence is with us in this world. Thou knowest that the
elements gradually evolved metals, plants, animals, man, finally the
pure essence of man. The whole evolution took place for the sake of this
essence, in order that the Divine Influence should inhabit it. That
essence, however, came into existence

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

for the sake of the highest essence, viz. the prophets and pious. A
similar gradation can be observed in the prayer: 'Give thy fear, O Lord
our God, over all Thy works.' Then: 'Give glory to Thy people'; finally:
'The pious shall see and rejoice,' because they are the purest essence.

45\. Al Khazari: Thy interesting comparison has completely riveted my
attention. But I should expect to see more hermits and ascetics among
you than among other people.

46\. The Rabbi: I regret that thou hast forgotten those fundamental
principles in which thou didst concur. Did we not agree that man cannot
approach God except by means of deeds commanded by him? Dost thou think
that this can be gained by meekness, humility, etc., alone?

47\. Al Khazari: Certainly, and rightly so. I think I read in your books
as follows: 'What doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the
Lord thy God' (Deut. x. 12) and 'What doth the Lord require of thee'
(Mic. vi. 8), and many similar passages?

48\. The Rabbi: These are the rational laws, being the basis and
preamble of the divine law, preceding it in character and time, and
being indispensable in the administration of every human society. Even a
gang of robbers must have a kind of justice among them if their
confederacy is to last. When Israel's disloyalty had come to such a pass
that they disregarded rational and social principles (which are as
absolutely necessary for a society as are the natural functions of
eating, drinking, exercise, rest, sleeping, and waking for the
individual), but held fast to the sacrificial worship and other divine
laws, He was satisfied with even less. It was told to

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

them: 'Haply you might observe those laws which rule the smallest and
meanest community, such as refer to justice, good actions, and
recognition of God's bounty.' For the divine law cannot become complete
till the social and rational laws are perfected. The rational law
demands justice and recognition of God's bounty. What has he, who fails
in this respect, to do with offerings, Sabbath, circumcision, etc.,
which reason neither demands, nor forbids? These are, however, the
ordinations especially given to Israel as a corollary to the rational
laws. Through this they received the advantage of the Divine Influence,
without knowing how it came to pass that the 'Glory of God' descended
upon them, and that 'the fire of God' consumed their offerings; how they
heard the allocution of the Lord; and how their history developed. These
are matters which reason would refuse to believe if they were not
guaranteed by irrefutable evidence. In a similar sense it was said to
them: 'What doth the Lord thy God require of thee?' (Deut. x. 12) and
'Add your burnt offerings' (Jer. vii. 21), and similar verses. Can it be
imagined that the Israelites observe 'the doing of justice and the love
of mercy;' but neglect circumcision, Sabbath, and the other laws, and
felt happy withal?

49\. Al Khazari: After what thou hast said I should not think so. In the
opinion of philosophers, however, he becomes a pious man who does not
mind in which way he approaches God, whether as a Jew or a Christian, or
anything else he chooses. Now we have returned to reasoning, speculating
and dialectics. According of this everyone might endeavour to belong to
a creed dictated by his own speculating, a thing which would be absurd.

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

50\. The Rabbi: The divine law imposes no asceticism on us. It rather
desires that we should keep the equipoise, and grant every mental and
physical faculty its due, as much as it can bear, without overburdening
one faculty at the expense of another. If a person gives way to
licentiousness he blunts his mental faculty; he who is inclined to
violence injures some other faculty. Prolonged fasting is no act of
piety for a weak person who, having succeeded in checking his desires,
is not greedy. For him feasting is a burden and self-denial. Neither is
diminution of wealth an act of piety, if it is gained in a lawful way,
and if its acquisition does not interfere with study and good works,
especially for him who has a household and children. He may spend part
of it in almsgiving, which would not be displeasing to God; but to
increase it is better for himself. Our law, as a whole, is divided
between *fear*, *love*, and *joy*, by each of which one can approach
God. Thy contrition on a fast day does nothing the nearer to God than
thy joy on the Sabbath and holy days, if it is the outcome of a devout
heart. Just as prayers demand devotion, so also is a pious mind
necessary to find pleasure in God's command and law; that thou shouldst
be pleased with the law itself from love of the Lawgiver. Thou seest how
much He has distinguished thee, as if thou hadst been His guest invited
to His festive board. Thou thankest Him in mind and word, and if thy joy
lead thee so far as to sing and dance, it becomes worship and a bond of
union between thee and the Divine Influence. Our law did not consider
these matters optional, but laid down decisive injunctions concerning
them, since it is not in the power of mortal man to apportion to each
faculty of the soul and body its right measure, nor to

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

decide what amount of rest and exertion is good, or to determine how
long the ground should be cultivated till it finds rest in the years of
release and jubilee, or the amount of tithe to be given, etc. God
commanded cessation of work on Sabbath and holy days, as well as in the
culture of the soil, all this 'as a remembrance of the exodus from
Egypt,' and 'remembrance of the work of creation.' These two things
belong together, because they are the outcome of the absolute divine
will, but not the result of accident or natural phenomena. It is said:
'For ask now of the days that are past--Did ever a people hear the voice
of God--Or hath God assayed,' etc. (Deut. iv. 32 sqq.). The observance
of the Sabbath is itself an acknowledgment of His omnipotence, and at
the same time an acknowledgment of the creation by the divine word. He
who observes the Sabbath because the work of creation was finished on it
acknowledges the creation itself. He who believes in the creation
believes in the Creator. He, however, who does not believe in it falls a
prey to doubts of God's eternity and to doubts of the existence of the
world's Creator. The observance of the Sabbath is therefore nearer to
God than monastic retirement and ascetism. Behold how the Divine
Influence attached itself to Abraham, and then to all those who shared
his excellence and the Holy Land. This Influence followed him
everywhere, and guarded his posterity, preventing the detachment of any
of them, it brought them to the most sheltered and best place, and
caused them to multiply in a miraculous manner, and finally raised them
to occupy a degree worthy of such excellence. He is, therefore, called:
'God of Abraham' (Gen. xxviii. 13),'God of the land' (1 Sam. iv.
4),'Dwelling between the Cherubim' (Ps. ix. 12), 'Dwelling in Zion '

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Ps. cxxxv. 21),
'Abiding in Jerusalem' (Ps. cxxiii. 1), these places being compared to
heaven, as it is said: 'Dwelling in heaven' (Ps. cxxiii. 1). His light
shines in these places as in heaven, although through mediums which are
fit to receive this light. He sheds it upon them, and this it is that is
called *love*. It has been taught us, and we have been enjoined to
believe in it, as well as to praise and thank Him in the prayer: "With
eternal love Thou lovest us"; so that we should bear in mind that it
originally came from Him, but not from us. To give an instance, we do
not say that an animal created itself, but that God formed and fashioned
it, having selected the proper matter for it. In the same manner it was
He who initiated our delivery from Egypt to be His people and to
acknowledge Him as king, as He said: 'I am the Lord your God who led you
out of the land of Egypt to be unto you a God' (Lev. xxii. 33, Num. xv.
41). He also says: 'O Israel, in whom I will be glorified' (Is. xlix.
3).

51\. Al Khazari: This sentence seems to go too far, and is overbold in
expressing that the Creator is glorified through mortal man.

52\. The Rabbi: Wouldst thou find this less strange in the creation of
the sun?

53\. Al Khazari: Certainly, on account of its great power. Next to God
it is the cause of being. By its means night and day and the seasons of
the year are determined; minerals, metals, plants, and animals were
developed through its instrumentality. Its light produced sight and
colours. Wherefore should not the action of such a thing be an object of
glory among men?

54\. The Rabbi: Are not the intellectual faculties much finer than the
light that is seen? Or were not

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

the inhabitants of the earth prior to the Israelites in blindness and
error excepting those few whom I mentioned? Some people said that there
was no Creator; that no part of the world was more worthy of being
created than being creator, the universe being eternal. Others say that
the spheres are eternal and creative. They consequently adore them.
Others again assert that the fire is the essence of light and all the
miraculous products of its power; it must, therefore, be worshipped. The
soul also is fire. Others worship different things, viz. sun, moon,
stars, and animal forms, which are in connexion with special phenomena.
Other people adore their kings and sages. They all, however, agree that
there is nothing in the world which is contrary to nature, nor is there
any Providence. Even philosophers who, with their refined intuition and
clear view, acknowledge a Prime Cause different from earthly things and
unparalleled, are inclined to think that this Prime Cause exercises no
influence on the world, and certainly not on individuals, as he is too
exalted to know them, much less to make them the basis of a new entity.
The community was at last considered sufficiently pure for the light to
dwell on it, to be worthy of seeing miracles which changed the course of
nature, and to understand that the world had a King who watched and
guarded it, who knew both great and small, rewarded the good and the
wicked, and directed the hearts. All who came after these philosophers
could not detach themselves from their principles, so that to-day the
whole civilized world acknowledges that God is eternal, and that the
world was created. They look upon the Israelites and all that befell
them as a proof of this.

55\. Al Khazari: This is glory indeed, and an extraordinary

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

proof. It is justly written: 'To make Himself an everlasting name' (Is.
lxiii. 12), 'So didst Thou get Thee a name as it is this day' (Neh. ix.
10), and 'In praise, in name, and in honour' (Deut. xxvi. 19).

56\. The Rabbi: Didst thou not see how David introduces the praise of
the Tōrāh, when he first speaks of the sun in the words: 'The heavens
declare the glory of God' (Ps. xix. 2). He describes how ubiquitous its
light, how pure its body, how steady its path, and beautiful its
countenance. This is followed by the words: 'The law of the Lord is
perfect' (ver. 7), etc., as if he wished to convey that one should not
wonder at such a description. For the Tōrāh is more pure, more
resplendent, more widely known, more exalted, and more useful still. If
there were no Israelites there would be no Tōrāh. They did not derive
their high position from Moses, but Moses received his for their sake.
The divine love dwelt among the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob. The choice of Moses, however, was made in order that the good
fortune might come to them through his instrumentality. We are not
called the people of Moses, but the people of God, as it is said: 'The
people of the Lord' (Ezek. xxxvi. 20) and 'The people of the God of
Abraham' (Ps. xlvii. 10). Proof of the Divine Influence is not found in
well chosen words, in raising the eyebrows, closing the eyes during
prayers, contrition, movement, and talk behind which there are no deeds;
but a pure mind, illustrated by corresponding actions which, by their
very nature, are difficult to perform, and are yet performed with the
utmost zeal and love. It is to be found in one who, wherever he may,
strives to reach the chosen place three times a year, and bearing with
the greatest pleasure and joy all fatigues

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

and expenses connected therewith. He pays the 'first tithe,' and the
'second tithe,' and the 'poor tithe,' and the expenses connected with
his apparel for the Temple. He renounces the harvest in the years of
release and jubilee, incurs expense for a tabernacle, holy days, and
abstention from work; gives the first fruits, the firstborn animals,
priests' emoluments, the first of the shearing, and the first of the
dough, apart from vows and free gifts, and fines connected with
intentional and unintentional sins, and peace offerings. Further
offerings due on account of private happenings, impurity, child-bed,
issue, leprosy, and many other things. All this is regulated by divine
command, without \[human\] speculation. It is not possible for man to
determine the relative importance of each, and he need not fear any
[deterioration](errata.htm#2.md) in them. It is as if He assessed Israel,
and measured them as well as the harvests of Palestine as regards
vegetable and animal life. He also considered the tribe of Levi, and
ordained these [assessments](errata.htm#3.md) in the desert, because he
knew that, as long as they were not infringed, Israel would retain its
surplus, and the Levite would not be in want. It never could come to
such a pass that a tribe or family would be reduced to poverty, because
he ordained the return of the whole property in the year of jubilee in
the same status as it was in the first year of the distribution of the
land. The details of these regulations would fill volumes. He who
studies them carefully will see that they are not of human origin.
Praised be He who has contrived them: 'He hath not dealt so with any
nation; they are judgments which they knew not' (Ps. cxlvii. 20). This
arrangement lasted during the periods of both Temples for about 1,300
years, and had the people remained in

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

the straight path, it would have been 'as the days of the heaven on
earth' (Deut. xi. 20).

57\. Al Khazari: At present you are in great confusion concerning those
heavy duties. What nation could observe such regulations?

58\. The Rabbi: The community whose guardian and compensator is always
in its midst--I mean God. Joshua said: 'You cannot serve the Lord, for
He is an holy God' (chap. xxiv. 19). Notwithstanding this, his community
was so zealously observing that, in the matter of the trespass of 'the
devoted thing of Jericho,' not more than the one, Achan, was found
disobedient among more than six hundred thousand. The punishment
followed immediately, just as it did in the case of Miriam, who was
afflicted with leprosy; also in the cases of Uzzah, Nadab and Abihu, and
the people of Beth-Shemesh, who were punished because they had 'looked
into the ark of the Lord' (1 Sam. vi. 19). It was one of the wonderful
traits of God that His displeasure for minor transgressions was shown on
the walls of houses and in the clothes, whilst for more grievous sins
the bodies were more or less severely stricken. The priests were
appointed to study this profound science and to discover to what extent
these trials were God's punishment (this often took them weeks to find
out, as was the case with Miriam), or how much was simply
constitutionally curable or incurable. This is an abstruse science to
which God pointed in the words: 'Take heed in the plague of leprosy,
that thou observe diligently and do according to all that the priests,
the Levites, shall teach you' (Deut. xxiv. 8).

59\. Al Khazari: Hast thou a satisfactory argument on the matter?

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

60\. The Rabbi: I told thee that there is no comparison to be made
between our intelligence and the Divine Influence, and it is proper that
we leave the cause of these important things unexamined. I take,
however, the liberty of stating--though not with absolute
certainty--that leprosy and issue are occasionally the consequence of
contamination by corpses. A dead body represents the highest degree of
malignancy, and a leprous limb is as if dead. It is the same with lost
σπέρμα, because it had been endowed with living power, capable of
engendering a human being. Its loss, therefore, forms a contrast to the
living and breathing, and on account of its ideal potentiality only
affects noble minds and highly strung souls which incline towards the
divine, prophetic, visionary, and towards genuine imagination. There are
people who feel depressed as long as they have not purified themselves
after such an accident. Experience has taught them that their touch
deteriorates such fine things as pearls and wine. Most of us feel
influenced by the vicinity of dead bodies and graves, and our spirits
are depressed as long as we find ourselves in a house in which there is
a corpse. Those of coarser mould remain untouched. We see the same in
intellectual matters. He who seeks purity of thought in philosophic
studies, or purity of soul in prayer, feels uncomfortable in the
association with women and scoffers, or during the recitation of jocular
or love songs.

61\. Al Khazari: This explains to me why the physical birthright, viz.
the σπέρμα, contaminates, though being wholly spiritual, whilst other
excreta do not do so, in spite of their repulsive aspect, odour, and
quantity. Now I should still like to hear the explanation of the leprosy
of the garment and the house.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

62\. The Rabbi: I mentioned that as one of the characteristics of the
Shekhinah, that it occupies in Israel the same place as the spirit of
life in the human body. It granted them a divine life, and allowed them
to find lustre, beauty, and light in their souls, bodies, dispositions,
and houses. When it was absent from them, their intelligence waned,
their bodies deteriorated, and their beauty faded. The effect of the
disappearance of the divine light became noticeable in every individual.
One can easily see how the breath of a person is suddenly lost through
fear and sorrow, whereby the body also suffers. On women and boys who go
out at night one may sometimes see black and green marks, the result of
their weak nerves. This is attributed to demons, but diseases of body
and mind are often produced by the sight of people who have died or were
killed.

63\. Al Khazari: I perceive that your law comprises all sorts of
profound and strange sciences, -not to be found in other codes.

64\. The Rabbi: The members of the Synhedrion were bound not to let any
science, real and fictitious, or conventional, escape their knowledge,
magic and language included. How was it possible at all times to find
seventy scholars unless learning was common among the people? If one
elder died, another of the same stamp succeeded him. This could not be
otherwise, as all branches of science were required for the practice of
the law. Natural sciences was wanted for agriculture, in order to
recognise 'mingled seed,' to be careful with the produce of the seventh
year and of newly planted trees, to distinguish the various kinds of
plants, that their nature might be preserved, and one species be not
mixed

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

up with another. It is difficult enough to know whether *chondros* is a
kind of barley, or spelt, a kind of wheat, or *brassica* is a kind of
cabbage; to study the powers of their roots and how far they spread in
the ground; how much of it remains for the following year, and how much
does not remain; how much space and time is to be left between each
species. Further, the distinction of the various species of animals
served various purposes, among which is to know which communicates
poison and which not. With this is connected the knowledge of injuries
which make an animal unlawful for food. This is even more profound than
what Aristotle wrote on the subject, viz. how to know which injuries are
fatal and thus to deter people from eating carrion. The small remnant of
this knowledge which has remained makes us wonder. Add to this the
acquaintance with the blemishes which disqualify priests from taking
part in the Temple service, as well as of the blemishes which prohibit
the offering up of certain animals as sacrifices. Then there is the
knowledge of the various kinds of issue and of the period of
purification. All this requires instruction. Man is not able to
determine these matters by reflection alone, without divine assistance.
The same is the case with the knowledge of the revolutions of the
spheres, of which the yearly calendar is but one fruit. The excellence
of the calculation of the calendar is famous, and it is well known what
deep root it has taken among these people, few in number, yet
excellently equipped with model institutions. Could it be otherwise? On
account of the smallness, humbleness, and dispersion of the people it is
hardly noticed among the other nations, yet those relics of the Divine
made it into one firmly established organization.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The calendar,
based on the rules of the revolution of the moon, as handed down by the
House of David, is truly wonderful. Though hundreds of years have
passed, no mistake has been found in it, whilst the observations of
Greek and other astronomers are not faultless. They were obliged to
insert corrections and supplements every century, whilst our calendar is
always free from error, as it rests on prophetic tradition. Had there
been the smallest flaw in a fundamental rule this would to-day have
assumed serious proportions, on account of the time difference between
the conjunction of the moon and the moment when she becomes visible. In
the same manner our sages were, without doubt, acquainted with the
movements of the sun and astronomy in general. Music was the pride of a
nation which distributed their songs in such a way that they fell to the
lot of the aristocracy of the people, viz. the Levites, who made
practical use of them in the holy house and in the holy season. For
their maintenance they were satisfied with the tithes, as they had no
occupation but music. As an art it is highly esteemed among mankind, as
long as it is not abused and degraded, and as long as the people
preserves its original nobleness and purity. David and Samuel were its
great masters. Dost thou think that they understood it well or not?

65\. Al Khazari: There can be no doubt that *their* art was most
perfect, and touched the souls, as people say that it changes the humour
of a man's soul to a different one. It is impossible that it should now
reach the same high level. It has deteriorated, and servants and
half-crazy people are its patrons. Truly, Rabbi, it sank from its
greatness, as you have sunk in spite of your former greatness.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

66\. The Rabbi: What is thy opinion of Solomon's accomplishments? Did he
not, with the assistance of divine, intellectual, and natural power,
converse on all sciences? The inhabitants of the earth travelled to him,
in order to carry forth his learning, even as far as India. Now the
roots and principles of all sciences were handed down from us first to
the Chaldaeans, then to the Persians and Medians, then to Greece, and
finally to the Romans. On account of the length of this period, and the
many disturbing circumstances, it was forgotten that they had originated
with the Hebrews, and so they were ascribed to the Greeks and Romans. To
Hebrew, however, belongs the first place, both as regards the nature of
the languages, and as to fullness of meanings.

67\. Al-Khazari: Is Hebrew superior to other languages? Do we not see
distinctly that the latter are more finished and comprehensive?

68\. The Rabbi: It shared the fate of its bearers, degenerating and
dwindling with them. Considered historically and logically, its original
form is the noblest. According to tradition it is the language in which
God spoke to Adam and Eve, and in which the latter conversed. It is
proved by the derivation of Adam from *adāmāh*, *ishshāh* from *ish*;
*ḥayyāh* from *ḥayy*; *Cain* from *qānīthī*; *Shēth* from *shāth*, and
Noah from *y<sup>e</sup>naḥ*, *mēnū*. This is supported by the evidence
of the Tōrāh. The whole is traced back to Eber, Noah and Adam. It is the
language of Eber after whom it was called *Hebrew*, because after the
confusion of tongues it was he who retained it. Abraham was an Aramaean
of *Ur Kasdim*, because the language of the Chaldaeans was Aramaic. He
employed Hebrew as a specially holy language and

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aramaic for
everyday use. For this reason Ishmael brought it to the Arabic speaking
nations, and the consequence was that Aramaic, Arabic and Hebrew are
similar to each other in their vocabulary, grammatical rules, and
formations. The superiority of Hebrew is manifest from the logical point
of view if we consider the people who employed it for discourses,
particularly at the time when prophecy was rife among them, also for
preaching, songs and psalmody. It is conceivable that their rulers such
as for instance, Moses, Joshua, David, and Solomon lacked the words to
express what they wished, as it is the case with us to-day, because it
is lost to us? Dost thou not see how the Tōrāh, when describing the
Tabernacle, Ephōd and breastplate and other objects, always finds the
most suitable word for all these strange matters? How beautifully is
this description composed? It is just the same with the names of people,
species of birds and stones, the diction of David's Psalms, the
lamentations of Job, and his dispute with his friends, the addresses of
Isaiah, etc.

69\. Al-Khazari: Thou wilt only succeed in placing it on a par with
other languages thus. But where is its pre-eminence? Other languages
surpass it in songs metrically constructed and arranged for tunes 41

70\. The Rabbi: It is obvious that a tune is independent of the metre,
or of the lesser or greater number of syllables. The verse *hōdū
la’dōnāi ki tōb* can, therefore, be sung to the same tune as
*l<sup>e</sup>ōsē niflāōth g<sup>e</sup>dōlōth l<sup>e</sup>baddō*. This
is the rule in sentences in which the tune must follow the grammatical
construction. Rhymed poems, however, which are recited, and in which a
good metre is noticeable, are neglected for something higher and more
useful.

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

71\. Al-Khazari: And what may that be?

72\. The Rabbi: The faculty of speech is to transmit the idea of the
speaker into the soul of the hearer. Such intention, however, can only
be carried out to perfection by means of oral communication. This is
better than writing. The proverb is: 'From the mouths of scholars, but
not from the mouth of books.' Verbal communication finds various aids
either in pausing or continuing to speak, according to the requirements
of the sentence, by raising or lowering the voice, in expressing
astonishment, question, narrative, desire, fear or submission by means
of gestures, without which speech by itself would remain inadequate.
Occasionally the speaker even has recourse to movements of eyes,
eyebrows, or the whole head and hands, in order to express anger,
pleasure, humility or haughtiness to the degree desired. In the remnant
of our language which was created and instituted by God, are implanted
subtle elements calculated to promote understanding, and to take the
place of the above aids to speech. These are the accents with which the
holy text is read. They denote pause and continuation, they separate
question from answer, the beginning from the continuation of the speech,
haste from hesitation, command from request, on which subject books
might be written. He who intends to do this must omit poetry, because it
can only be recited in one way. For it mostly connects when it should
stop and stops where it should go on. One cannot avoid this except with
great trouble.

73\. Al-Khazari: It is but proper that mere beauty of sound should yield
to lucidity of speech. Harmony pleases the ear, but exactness makes the
meaning clear.

I see, however, that you Jews long for a prosody, in

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

imitation of other peoples, in order to force the Hebrew language into
their metres.

74\. The Rabbi: This is because we remained and are froward. Instead of
being satisfied with the superiority mentioned above, we corrupted the
structure of our language, which is built on harmony, and created
discord.

75\. Al-Khazari: How so?

76\. The Rabbi: Didst thou not see that a hundred persons read the Tōrāh
as one person, stopping in one moment, and continuing simultaneously?

77\. Al-Khazari I have, indeed, observed this, and never saw the like of
it either among Persians or Arabs. It is impossible in the recitation of
a poem. Now I should like to know how the Hebrew language obtained that
advantage, and how the metre interferes with it.

78\. The Rabbi: The reason is that you can put together two
\[vowelless\] consonants, but not three vowels, except in rare cases
This not only gives the speech a rest, but enables it to obtain that
advantage, viz. consonance and fluency in reading. This makes learning
by heart and the grasping of the meaning easy. The first thing which
destroys metrical reading is the relation of those two consonants.
Correct accentuation becomes impossible, so that *ŏkhlāh* (food) is read
like *ōkh<sup>e</sup>lāh* (she is eating); *ŏmrō* (his word) and *āmerū*
(they have spoken) have metrically the same value as *ōmēr* (speaking)
and *ōmer* (word). Thus also the time difference between *shábti*, which
is past tense, and *w<sup>e</sup> shabtí*, which is future, lost. We
might find a way out of this difficulty if we followed the ways of the
*Piyyūt* which does not interfere with the language,

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

and merely employs the rhyme. But in matters of poetry, the same befell
us which befell our forefathers, concerning whom it is written: 'They
mingled among the gentiles and learned their works '(Ps. cvi. 35).

79\. Al-Khazari: I should like to ask whether thou knowest the reason
why Jews move to and fro when reading the Bible?

80\. The Rabbi: It is said that it is done in order to arouse natural
heat. My personal belief is that it stands in connexion with the subject
under discussion. As it often happened that many persons read at the
same time, it was possible that ten or more read from one volume. This
is the reason why our books are so large. Each of them was obliged to
bend down in his turn in order to read a passage, and to turn back
again. This resulted in a continual bending and sitting up, the book
lying on the ground. This was one reason. Then it became a habit through
constant seeing, observing and imitating, which is in man's nature.
Other people read each out of his own book, either bringing it near to
his eyes, or, if he pleased, bending down to it without inconveniencing
his neighbour. There was, therefore, no necessity of bending and sitting
up. We will now discuss the importance of the accents, the orthographic
value of the seven principal vowel signs, the grammatical accuracy
resulting from them as well as from the distinction between Qāmeṣ,
Pataḥ, Ṣērē and Sēgōl. They influence the meaning of grammatical forms
and assist in distinguishing between past and future tenses e.g.,
‏שַׁמתִּי‎ and ‏ושַׁמְתִּי‎ and ‏וַאֲבָרְכֵהוּ‎ and ‏וְאַבָרְכֵהוּ‎.
(Is. li. 2, and Gen. xxvii, 33); or between a verb and an adjective,
e.g. ‏חָבַם‎ and ‏חָבָם‎; between the interrogative *Hē* and the
article, as in ‏הָעוֹלָה הִיא לִמָעְלָה‎

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Eccl. iii. 21),
and other cases. The euphony and structure of speech is increased by the
sequence of two vowelless consonants, which enables a whole congregation
to read Hebrew simultaneously without mistakes. Other rules apply to the
musical [accents](errata.htm#4.md). For the vowel sounds are divided in
Hebrew into three classes, viz. U-sound, A-sound, and I-sound; or in
another division: great U-sound, or *Qāmeṣ*, medium U-sound, or *Ḥōlem*;
little U-sound, or *Shūreq*; great A-sound, or *Pataḥ*; little A-sound
or *Sēgōl*; great I-sound or *Sērē*; little I-sound, or *Ḥīreq*. Shewā
is sounded with all these \[vowels\] under certain conditions. It is
vowel absolute, because any addition would require a vowelless consonant
to follow. *Qāmeṣ* is followed by a long closed syllable, but not by
dāgēsh in the first form Dagēsh can only follow, if demanded by the
exigencies of the second or third forms, the syllable being long, by one
of the vowel letters *alef* or *hē*, as in ‏ברא‎ and ‏קנה‎. A syllable
of this kind can also end in a vowelless consonant, as in ‏קאם‎ (Hos. x.
14). Ḥōlem also can be followed by a vowel letter which is *wāw* or
*alef* as in ‏לא‎ and ‏לו‎, or a syllable of this kind can be closed by
a consonant as ‏שׁור‎ and ‏שׂמׂאל‎. The vowel letters after Ṣērē are
*alef* or *yōd* as in ‏יוצא‎ and ‏יוצאי‎. *Hē*, however, only in the
second form, but not in the first. *Shūreq* is free for all three forms.
It can be followed by a vowel letter, or dāgēsh, or vowelless consonant.
Its long vowel is expressed by *wāw* only as, ‏לו‎, ‏ללון‎ and ‏לֻקח‎.
[*Ḥīreq*](errata.htm#5.md) follows the rule of *Shūreq* as in ‏לין‎, ‏לי‎
and ‏לבי‎. *Pataḥ*, and [*Sēgōl*](errata.htm#6.md) are not followed by a
vowel letter in the first form, but are lengthened by the second form,
either for the sake of emphasis, or on account of the accent, or in the
pause

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

at the end of a sentence. The rules of the *first form* are obtained by
considering the formation of each word separately, without any relation
to the construction of the sentence with its variety of combination and
separation, and long and short words. Then are obtained the seven
principal vowels in their original, unchanged form and the simple Shewā
without *qa’yā*. The *second form* deals with euphony in the
construction of sentences. Occasionally elements of the first form are
altered to please the second. The *third form* concerns the accents, and
sometimes reacts on both preceding ones. In the first form three
consecutive vowels without an intervening consonant or dāgesh are
possible, but three, or more, short vowels may follow each other as in
Arabic. This, however, is impossible in the second form. As soon as
three vowels follow each other in the first form, the second one
lengthens one of them to the quantity of a long vowel as in ‏משבָני‎,
‏לשבֵני‎, ‏רצפת‎ (Ps. xxxi. 12; Esth. i. 6). For Hebrew does not allow
three consecutive vowels, except when a consonant is either repeated as
in ‏שררך‎ (Cant. vii. 3), or in the case of gutturals as in ‏נהרי‎ and
‏נחלי‎, the reader being at liberty to read \[the first syllable\] long
or short. In the same way the first form allows the sequence of two long
closed syllables. The second form, however, to prevent clumsiness of
speech, shortens one long syllable as in ‏שמתי‎ and ‏ושמתי‎. It is
obvious that the pronunciation of ‏פעל‎ and similar forms is contrary to
its vocalisation, the second syllable being lengthened in spite of the
Pataḥ, whilst the first is read short in spite of the
[Qāmeṣ](errata.htm#7.md). The heightening of the second syllable is due to
the tone, but not to make it slightly longer. Words as ‏אמר-לי‎ and
‏עשה-לי‎ (Gen. xx. 5; xxi. 6)

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

remain therefore in the first form, because the smaller word has the
tone. We also find ‏פָעָל‎ with two Qāmeṣ though in the past tense. The
cause of this is to be found in the *athnaḥ* or *sōf* *pāsūq*, and we
say that this is possible in the second form on account of the pause. We
follow this up till we find even ‏פָעָל‎ with two Qāmeṣ and zāqēf. The
reason of this we find in a virtual pause, the word being entitled to
*athnaḥ* or *sōf* *pāsūq*, but other cogent reasons made *athnaḥ* and
*sōf* *pāsūq* in this case impossible. On the other hand we find these
two accents with two pataḥs, however strange this may be, e.g. ‏ויאמַר‎,
‏וזקנתי‎, ‏ותשברנה‎, ‏וַיִּלַךָ‎. The reason of pataḥ in ‏ויאמר‎ is
found in examining its meaning, as it cannot stand in pause, and is
necessarily connected with the following complement of the sentence
There are only a few exceptions as ‏כאשר אָמָר‎, (Gen. xxi. 1), because
the verb completes the sentence logically, and can take Qāmeṣ because of
the pause.

As regards, however, ‏וילך‎ and ‏ותשברנה‎, they should originally be
‏ויֵלֵך‎ and ‏ותשבֵרנה‎; but the transformation of the I-sound with
great Pataḥ, without any intermediate element, was too awkward, and
therefore Pataḥ stepped in. The form ‏זקנתי‎ belongs probably to the
same class, because the root is ‏זָקֵן‎, the Ṣērē being changed into
Pataḥ at the end of a sentence. We marvel why the ‏פֶעֶל‎ forms have the
accent on the first syllable which is read long, although it has Sēgōl.
We must, however, consider that, if the first syllable remained short,
Hebrew phonology would require the second syllable to be read long and
with accent, and a slight quiescent would creep in between the second
and third radicals. This would be inelegant, which is not the

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

case in the first syllable, which must have this quiescent and has also
room for it. This lengthening of the penultima corresponds to ‏פֶן עֶל‎,
but not to ‏פָן עֱל‎. For when the word has *athnaḥ*, or *sōf* *pāsūq*,
it is ‏פָעֶל‎ corresponding to ‏פָאן עֶל‎. This shows the necessity of
lengthening the vowel in ‏שַמתי‎ and ‏שָמתי‎. We consider forms like
‏שער‎ and ‏נער‎ likewise strange, because the Pataḥ of the first
syllable is read long. We soon discover, however, that they are ‏פֶעֶל‎
forms with Pataḥ on account of the guttural. For this reason they
undergo no change in the *status constructus*, as do ‏נהר‎ and ‏קהל‎
(Gen. xv. 18; Exod. xii. 6), which are formed like ‏דָבָר‎. Then we find
‏אעשה‎, ‏יעשה‎, ‏אבנה‎ and ‏אקנה‎ with Sēgōl and vowel letters. If we
consider the first instance, we find it to be a form ‏אפעל‎, ‏יפעל‎, the
second radical not being long, but always forming a closed syllable with
Pataḥ. We are now to read ‏אעשֶה‎ instead of [Pataḥ](errata.htm#8.md),
because no A-sound can precede a silent *hē*, unless it be Qāmeṣ. Qāmeṣ
is long, whilst the second radical of a verb can never have a long
vowel, except when read with a vowel, or when followed by Alef as in
‏אצֵא‎. It is for this reason that ‏אעשׂה‎ is read with Sēgōl which is
the shortest vowel imaginable, but interchanges with Ṣērē when the
second form requires to replace the one by the other at the ends of
sentences. There is almost no necessity for the hē of ‏אעשה‎ except in
the pause or with the accent, and is eased by dāgesh as in ‏אעשה-לך‎ and
‏אבנה-לי‎, (Exod. xxxiii. 5), in which cases the hē has no function.
This is not the case \[with ‏א‎\] in ‏אצא‎, ‏אבא‎. In ‏בא-לי‎, there is
no dāgesh, the ‏א‎ being preceded by Ṣērē and being a radical. Hē,
however, is considered to be so weak that it is both graphically and
phonetically

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

omitted in ‏ויבן‎, ‏ויקן‎ and ‏ויעש‎. How could it, then, close a
syllable vocalized by Ṣērē? It was, therefore, left to Sēgōl, the
slightest vowel, at all events, in the first form. The second form
changed it into Sērē, when standing in pause. It appears likewise
strange that ‏מראה‎, ‏מעשה‎, ‏מקנה‎ and similar forms have Ṣērē in the
construct state, but Sēgōl in the absolute. We should think the reverse
to be correct. But if we consider that the third radical, viz. a silent
*Hē* is treated as altogether absent, and those nouns have the forms of
‏מרא‎, ‏מעש‎, ‏מקן‎, nothing but Sēgōl will serve till some
circumstances bring it out with a long vowel as in ‏מראֵה‎, ‏מעשֵה‎,
‏מראיהן‎ and ‏מעשיהן‎. Sēgōl becomes Ṣērē to take the place of \[small\]
Pataḥ in ‏מראֵם‎ and ‏מעשׁםֵ‎. Words of the first form can be altered by
the second as to the vowels, but not as to the pronunciation. The word
‏בן‎ has Sērē in the absolute state, Sēgōl in the construct.
Occasionally the latter is lengthened by the tone as in ‏בן-יאיר‎ (Esth.
ii. 5) with the Sēgōl of the first form In other cases the tone
precipitates it, although it has Ṣērē according to the first form, as in
‏בן אחר‎ (Gen. xxx. 24). In segolate forms with the accent on the last
syllable Sērē is no longer perplexing. The author of this profound
science held secrets which are unknown to us. We may have discovered
some by means of which he intended to stimulate our investigation as we
have said above, with regard to ‏העולה היא למעלה‎. Or we might find out
the rules of distinguishing between past and future, infinitive and
participle of the passive voice, e.g. ‏נאסָף אל עמי‎ (Gen. xlix. 29),
with Qāmeṣ, and ‏נאשר נאסַף‎ (Num. xxvii. 13) with Pataḥ. The masoretic
text vocalizes three times ‏וישהָט‎ (Lev. viii. 15, 19, 23), with Qāmeṣ,
although

syntactically speaking the words stand only virtually in pause. There
are many instances that the Sēgōl after Zarqā has the force of Athnaḥ,
or sōf [pāsūq](errata.htm#9.md), or Zākēf, causing an alteration of the
first form. If I wished to enlarge an the subject, the book would become
too lengthy. I only desired to give thee a taste of this profound study,
which is not built on hap-hazard, but on fixed rules.

81\. Al Khazari: This is sufficient to enlighten me on the wonderful
character of the Hebrew language. Now I desire the description of a
servant of God according to your conception. Afterwards I will ask thee
for thy arguments against the Karaites. Then I should like to hear the
principal articles of faith and religious axioms. Finally I wish to know
which branches of ancient study have been preserved among you.

Finished is the second part, and we begin --
