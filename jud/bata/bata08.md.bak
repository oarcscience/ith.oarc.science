### Days of Fasting

### (<span class="smallcaps">Tractate Taanith</span>)

RABBI Yohanan said: There are three keys which the Holy One, blessed be
He, has not entrusted into the hands of any messenger, but keeps in his
own hand. These are: The key of rain, the key of birth, and the key of
the resurrection of the dead. The key of rain, for it is written:
(*Deut*. xxviii, 12) *The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure,
the heaven to give the rain unto the land in his season*. The key of
birth, for it is written: (*Gen*. xxx, 22) *And God remembered Rachel,
and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb*. The key of the
resurrection of the dead, for it is written: (*Ezek*. xxxvii, 13) *And
ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves*. In
the West they said, also the key of sustenance, for it is written:
(*Psalms* cxlv, 16) *Thou openest thy hand, etc*. Why did not Rabbi
Yohanan include this?—Well, he can say that "Rains" includes sustenance
also.

It was taught: The clouds and the winds are only secondary to the rain.
Which ones are they? Ulla, and

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

some say it was Rab Yehuda, said: Those that follow the rain, are these
then beneficial? Is it not written: (*Deut*. xxviii, 24) *The Lord shall
make the rain of thy land powder and dust*. To this Ulla, and some say
it was Rabbi Yehuda, said: Does this mean the wind that comes after the
rain?—There is no contradiction here. One speaks of a gentle rain, while
the other means a downpour. This latter throws up dust, while the first
does not.

Further Rabbi Yehuda said: The wind that comes after the rain is as good
as the rain; clouds that come after the rain are as good as the rain;
sunshine after the rain is doubly beneficial. What is excluded here? The
glow of the evening and sunshine between the clouds.

Raba said: Snow is as beneficial to the mountain as five-fold rain to
the earth, for it was said: (*Job* xxxvii, 6) *For he saith to the snow,
Be thou on the earth, likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain
of his strength*. And Raba also said: Snow for the mountains, hard rain
for the trees, a gentle rain for fruit of the fields, and even a drizzle
is good for the seeds under the hard sod.

Further Raba said: A young scholar is like a seed under the hard sod; if
he begins to sprout, he will shoot forth. Raba also said: If a young
scholar falls into a rage, it is only because the Torah has enraged him,
for it was said: (*Jeremiah* xxiii, 29) *Is not my word like as a fire?
saith the Lord*.

(*Gemara*)

 

IF ON the seventeenth of Marheshwan no rain has as yet fallen, then some
individuals begin to fast three days. They eat and drink after sundown,
they may

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

work, wash themselves, anoint themselves, put on sandals, and they may
have marital relations. If the first of Kislev came and no rain has
fallen, the court then orders the public to fast three days; they may
eat and drink after sundown. They may work, wash themselves, anoint
themselves, put on sandals, and they may have marital relations.

(*Mishna*)

 

THE Rabbis taught: When the people of Israel find themselves in trouble,
and one of them separates himself from the people, then the two angels
of service, who accompany every person, come and lay their hands on his
head and say: So-and-so, who has separated himself from the people,
shall not see the consolation of the people. In another place we
learned: When the people find themselves in trouble, let not a man say,
I will go into my home and eat and drink, and all will be well with me.
If he does so, it is of him that was written: (*Isaiah* xxii, 13) *And
behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh,
and drinking wine: let us eat and drink for tomorrow we shall die*. . .
. A man should share in the sorrows and troubles of his community, for
thus we found our master Moses, that he shared in common with the
community its sorrows and troubles, for it was said: (*Exodus* xvii, 12)
*But Moses’ hands were heavy, and they took a stone, and put it under
him and he sat thereon*. Did not Moses have a cushion or a bolster to
sit upon? This is to teach us that Moses wished to say: "All of Israel
find themselves in trouble, I too will suffer with them." And every
person who shares in the sorrows of the community, lives to see also the
consolation of the community. And perchance there

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

will be one who will say: "Who is there that will testify against
me?"—The stones of one's own house and the beams of his roof testify
against him, for it was said: (*Habakkuk* ii, 11) *For the stone shall
cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it*. In
the school of Rabbi Shila it was said that the two angels of service who
accompany each person will testify against him, for it was said:
(*Psalms* xci, 11) *For he shall give his angels charge over thee*.
Rabbi Hidka said: A man's own soul testifies against him, for it was
said: (*Micah* vii, 5) *Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth
in thy bosom*.

(*Gemara*)

 

IF THESE days passed and rain had not fallen, the court orders the
community to fast another three days. They may eat and drink while it is
still day, but they are not permitted to work, to wash themselves, to
anoint themselves, to put on sandals, nor to have marital relations; and
the bathhouses must be kept closed. If these days passed and rain had
not come, the court orders a further fast of seven days, making it
thirteen all together. These surpass the first day, for on these days
they blow the horn and they close the shops. On Mondays they are
permitted to open the shops partially, but on the fifth day they are
permitted to open the shops because of the honor of the Sabbath. If
these days passed, and no rains had fallen, men refrain from their
business affairs, they also refrain from building, and from planting; no
betrothals or marriages are arranged, and people do not greet one
another, as should be with men who have merited the scorn of the Lord.
Certain individuals fast till the end of Nisan. If the rains came

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

after Nisan has passed, it is a sign of a curse, for it was said: (1
*Samuel* xii, 17) *Is it not wheat harvest today?* etc. . . .

(*Mishna*)

 

IT IS logical that they would forbid the pleasures of bathing, anointing
and intercourse; but why forbid work that is drudgery? Rabbi Hisda
answered, in the name of Rabbi Jeremiah ben Abba: The Scriptures say:
(*Joel* i, 14) *Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the
elders*. This means that a fast day is as a solemn assembly; just as one
is not permitted to work during a solemn assembly, so one must not work
on a fast day. . . .

(*Gemara*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER I</span>

 

WHAT is the ritual of the days of fasting? They take out the Ark into
the public place in the town, they put wood ashes on the Ark, on the
head of the Prince and on the head of the Chief Justice of the Court,
and everyone puts ashes on his own head. The eldest among them recites
before them words of admonition: "My brethren, it was not said of the
people of Nineveh that the Lord saw their sackcloth and their fasting,
but (*Jonah* iii, 10) *And God saw their works, that they turned from
their evil ways* and it is further said: (*Joel* ii, 13) *Rend your
heart and not your garments*."

They stood in prayer, and they sent down to the Ark an old man who knew
how to recite the prayers, a mar, who had children, and who was in want,
so that his heart would be filled with his prayers. He would recite
before them twenty-four benedictions, the eighteen of the daily ritual,
and he would add six more.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

During the first three days of fasting the priests on duty would fast,
but not throughout the day; but the priests of the House of Fathers did
not fast at all. On the second three days, the priests on duty would
fast throughout the whole day, while the priests of the House of Fathers
would fast part of the day. On the last seven days they all fasted
throughout the whole of the day. These are the words of Rabbi Joshua,
but the Sages say: On the first three days none of the priests were
fasting, on the second three days, the priests on watch duty fasted part
of the day, but the priests of the House of the Fathers did not fast at
all. On the last seven days, the priests of the watch fasted throughout
the day while the priests of the House of the Fathers fasted, but only
part of the day.

A public fast must not be ordered to begin on a Thursday, so as not to
disrupt the prices in the market; but they order a three day fast to
begin Monday to be followed by fasting again Thursday and then Monday.

(*Mishna*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER II</span>

 

IF THERE is an epidemic of pestilence in a city, or houses collapse in
it, that city fasts and causes the sounding of horns, and in all the
surrounding places they fast, but do not sound the horn. Rabbi Akiba
says: they sound the horn, but they do not fast. What is termed an
epidemic? If in a city that can furnish five hundred infantry men three
deaths occur there in three consecutive days, it may be defined as a
city in which an epidemic rages. If it is less than this, then there is
no epidemic.

On the following occasions the horn is sounded: A

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

blight; mildew; locusts; crickets; wild beasts; and the danger of the
sword of an enemy. They sound the horn because this is a spreading
calamity.

It happened that the Sages went down from Jerusalem to their own towns
and ordered a fast because a blight the size of an oven's mouth was seen
in Ashkelon. And they also ordered a fast because wolves devoured two
children on the other side of the Jordan. Rabbi Yosi said not because
they devoured the children, but because they were seen.

For the following they sound the horn on the Sabbath: If a city is
surrounded by an enemy, if it is flooded by a river, or if a ship is
sinking in the harbor. Rabbi Yosi says: They sound the horn to summon
help, but not as a call to God. Simon the Yemenite said: They also sound
the horn in the case of pestilence, but the Sages did not agree with
him.

They sound the horn for any affliction that befalls the public,
excepting for an oversupply of rain.

It happened once that they said to Honi the circle-maker: "Pray for rain
to fall." He replied, go and fetch the Passover-ovens from the open so
they won't dissolve. He prayed but the rains did not come. What did he
do? He made a circle and stood within, and said: Lord of the Universe,
thy children have turned to me for I am as one of Thy household. I swear
by Thy great name that I shall not move from my place till Thou hast
compassion upon Thy children. Then rain began to fall in small drops.
Then he said: Not for that sort of rain did I pray, but for rain to fill
cisterns, pits and caves. Then rain began to fall in great violence.
Whereupon

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

he said: Not for this sort of rain did I pray, but for a rain of good
will, of benevolence and bounty. Then rain began to fall in the usual
way, and it rained till the people of Israel had to leave Jerusalem and
go up to the Mount of the Temple. Then they came to Honi and said to
him: As thou has prayed for the rain to come, go now and pray for the
rain to leave us. He said to them: Go and see if the stone of the
Strayers has been washed away. Simon ben Shetah sent word to him: "Hadst
thou not been Honi, I would have declared a Ban against thee. But what
shall I do to thee? Thou petitionest the Lord and He does as thou askest
him, as if thou wert a son who petitions a father, and the father
fulfills his will. It is of thy kind that it was written: (*Proverbs*
xxiii, 25) *Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare
thee shall rejoice*."

(*Mishna*)

 

WHAT is a plague of drought?—Rab Yehuda said in the name of Rab: A
plague which causes drought. Rab Nahman said: When to a field that is
situated on a stream we have to bring water from another stream, then we
call it drought. But when it has to be brought from another land, then
it is a famine. Rabbi Hanina said: If one *seah* of grain costs a
*sela*, but it is not to be had, then it is called famine. Rabbi Yohanan
said: This is spoken only of the time when money is cheap, but produce
is dear, but when money is dear while produce is cheap, then they sound
the horn forthwith. For Rabbi Yohanan said: I remember distinctly a time
when four *seah* of grain cost only one *sela*, but people in Tiberias
were swelling from hunger, because there was not an *issar* to be had.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

Rabbi Eleazar ben Perata said: From the day that the Temple was
destroyed the rainfalls were reduced. In some years there was plenty of
rainfall, while in other years there was little. In some years the rain
came in season, while in other years it came out of season. The year in
which the rains came in season is to be compared to a servant to whom
the master gave the food allowance on the first day of the week. Then we
find that the dough is baked well and can be eaten with satisfaction.
The year in which rains came out of season is compared to a servant to
whom the master gave the allowance on the eve of Sabbath; we then find
that the dough is not baked well. The year in which rain is plentiful is
compared to a servant to whom the master gave the whole yearly allowance
at one time, so that in the mill the loss in the grinding of a *kor* is
the same as the loss in grinding of a *kab* and in the kneading the same
waste entails in the kneading of a *kor* as in kneading a *kab*. A year
in which the fall of rain is small may be compared to the servant to
whom the master gives the allowance in small doses, we then find in the
mill the loss in grinding a *kab* the same as that in a *kor*, and
likewise the waste in kneading a *kab* is the same as that in a *kor*.
Another comparison: When the rainfall is plentiful it may be compared to
a man who kneads clay. If he has plenty of water, he does not use up all
of it and the clay is well kneaded, but if he has little water, he will
use up all that he has and the clay will not be kneaded properly.

 

THE Rabbis taught: Once the Israelites came for the pilgrimage to
Jerusalem, and there was no water for drinking purposes. Nakdimon ben
Gurion went to a

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

heathen magnate and said to him: Lend me twelve reservoirs of water for
which I will return to you twelve wells of water, or if I fail to give
you the wells, I shall give you twelve silver pieces, and he set a time
limit for the return of the payment. When the day of repayment came, and
rain had not fallen, the magnate sent word to Nakdimon that morning:
"Return to me the water or the money that I have with you," but Nakdimon
replied: "I have time the whole day." At midday he again received word
to return the water or the money. Nakdimon replied: "I still have time
to-day." Toward sundown again he received the message: "Return to me the
water or the money that I have with you." But Nakdimon replied: "I still
have time till the day is over." Whereupon the magnate sneered at him.
He said: "Now that rains had not fallen the whole year, you expect them
to fall now?" and in a cheerful mood he went down to the baths. Nakdimon
went to the temple very depressed. He covered himself with his shawl and
prayed before the Lord. He said: "Lord of the Universe. It is revealed
and known to Thee that I have not done this for my glory and not for the
glory of my father's house, but I have done this for Thy glory so that
the pilgrims shall have water for drinking." At once the skies were
darkened with clouds, and rain fell so that the twelve wells were filled
with water and there was even an overflow. When the magnate was coming
out of the bath-house, Nakdimon was emerging from the Temple. When they
met Nakdimon said to the magnate: "Pay me for the overflow that I have
with you." This one answered him: "I know that the Holy One, blessed be
He, disturbed the world only for your sake, but I still have a claim
against you, for

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

the sun had already set, therefore the rains fell when the matter was
already out of your hands." Nakdimon then returned to the Temple,
covered himself with his shawl and stood in prayer and said: "Lord of
the Universe! Make known that thou hast beloved ones in Thy world." At
once the clouds were dispersed and the sun shone again.

 

*FOR the Lord shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water* (1
*Kings* xiv, 15) . Rab Yehuda said in the name of Rab: This is a
blessing. For Rabbi Samuel ben Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi
Yohanan: Why is it written: (*Proverbs* xxvii, 6) *Faithful are the
wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful*. Better is
the curse of Ahiyah the Shilonite with which he cursed the people of
Israel, than the blessing with which the wicked Balaam blessed them.
Ahiyah the Shilonite cursed them by, comparing them to a reed, he said
to Israel: *For the Lord shall smite*, etc. As the reed grows by the
water, its stem grows new shoots and its roots are many, and though all
the wind of the universe blow upon it, they cannot move it from its
place, for it bends with the wind; if the winds stop, it goes back to
its upright position. But the wicked Balaam blessed them by comparing
them to the cedar, as it was said: (*Numbers* xxiv, 6) *As cedar trees
beside the waters*. Now, the cedar does not grow by the water and its
stock does not bring forth new shoots and its roots are not many, and
all the winds in the universe cannot move it from its place. However if
a south wind should blow at it, it uproots and turns it over. And not
this alone, but the reed was honored so that pens are made of it for

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

the writing of the Law, the Prophets and Hagiographa.

 

THE Rabbis taught: A man should always be as tender as the reed, and he
should not be as hard as the cedar. It happened once that Rabbi Eleazar
ben Simon was coming from Migdal Gedor, from the home of his teacher. He
was riding an ass, sauntering on the banks of a river. He was very happy
and in an elated mood, for he had done well in his studies. He met a man
who was very ugly. The man greeted him: "Peace be with you, Master", but
he did not return the greeting to him, but said instead: How ugly you
are. Are all your townspeople as ugly as you are? The man replied: I do
not know, but go and tell my Maker and say to him: "How ugly is the
vessel which thou hast made." Rabbi Eleazar realized at once that he had
sinned, he dismounted from his ass and prostrated himself before the man
and said to him: "I beseech you to forgive me." The man replied: I will
not forgive you till you have gone to the Master that created me and say
to him: How ugly is the vessel that thou hast made. Rabbi Eleazar walked
behind him till they arrived at the city. Here the townspeople came out
and said to him: Peace be with you, our teacher, our master. The man
said to them: Whom are you addressing as our teacher, our master? They
answered: The one that is walking behind you. Whereupon he said to them:
If this is our teacher, then may there be no more like him in Israel.
They asked him what was the reason, and he told them: "So-and-so he did
to me." Just the same, they said to him, you must forgive him, because
he is truly a great man and a great scholar. He then replied: For your
sake I shall forgive

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

him, with the understanding that he shall never do the like again.

 

SAID Raba to Rabbi Rafrom ben Papa: Will the master, kindly, tell us
some of the good deeds that Rab Huna was in the habit of doing? He
answered: I do not remember much of his childhood days, but well do I
remember the deeds of his later life. On cloudy days he would be driven
in a golden carriage and he would inspect the whole city. He would have
every weak wall pulled down. If the owner was able to rebuild it, he
would do so; otherwise Rab Huna would rebuild it for him at his own
expense. On every Sabbath eve, he would send his servant into the market
place, who would there buy off all the vegetables that remained in the
hands of the gardeners and would have them thrown into the river.—Why?
He could have given them away to the poor.—The poor would then come to
rely upon him, and would not buy anything in the market.—Well, he could
have given them to some animals.—He was of the opinion that food which
was fit for humans should not be given to animals.—Then he should not
have bought them up.—Then the gardeners would not bring enough into the
market.

When he had some good medicine he would fill a jar with it and suspend
it above his door, and would announce: Whoever may have need of it let
him come and help himself. Some say he knew of a cure for *sibetha* and
he suspended a jar full of water and announced: Whoever suffers from
*sibetha*, let him come and wash his hands with it and save his life
thereby. Whenever he was at meal, he would open his door and announce:

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Whoever wishes let
him come in and partake of my meal. Rabba said: I could do all these
things myself, except the last one, because there are too many people in
Mahuza.

 

Ilfa and Rabbi Yohanan studied the Law together, and they were both very
poor. They once talked it over and decided that they would engage in
business and fulfill the text: (*Deut*. xv, 4) *Save when there shall be
no poor among you*. Then they sat down against a weak wall and ate their
meal. Then two angels came, .and Rabbi Yohanan heard one of them say:
Let's throw the wall over upon these two men and kill them, for they
forsook the eternal for things earthly. However, one of the angels said:
No, leave them alone, for one of them has a great future before him.
Whereupon Yohanan said to Ilfa: Master, have you heard anything? but
Ilfa answered: No. Rabbi Yohanan thought: Since I heard it and Ilfa did
not, it must be I who am destined to do great things. He then said to
Ilfa: I will go back and fulfill the verse: (*Deut*. xv, 11) *For the
poor shall never cease out of the land*. Whereupon Rabbi Yohanan was
installed as rector of the Academy, and the scholars said to Ilfa: Had
you remained here to study, you would have been rector of the Academy.

 

IT IS related of Nahum of Gamzu that he was totally blind, that both of
his arms and legs were amputated, and his whole body was covered with
boils. He was lying in a dilapidated house, and the legs of his bed were
standing in basins of water, so that the ants would not crawl up on him.
His disciples came to take him out

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

from the house, and then they intended to take out his things. Whereupon
he said to them: take the things out first, and then take me out in my
bed, for I assure you as long as I am in it the house will not collapse,
but as soon as you take me out, the house is sure to collapse. They took
the things out first and then they took him out in his bed. No sooner
was he out than the house collapsed. His disciples said to him: Master,
since you are so wholly righteous, why should all this have happened to
you? He answered then: My children, I brought it all upon myself. Once,
on a journey to the house of my father-in-law, I had with me three
asses, one laden with food, one with liquids, and one with costly
delectables. A poor man came upon me on the road and stopped me and said
to me: Master, give me some food: I replied, Wait till I unload one of
the asses. Before I had time to unload the ass, the man expired. I fell
upon the man and exclaimed: My eyes that have had no pity upon you shall
be blinded, my arms that had no pity upon your arms shall fall off, and
my legs that had no pity upon your legs shall be cut off. I was not
satisfied till I said: My whole body shall be covered with sores. His
disciples cried: Woe to us that we see you in such a state. He replied,
It would have been woe to me had you not seen me in such a state. Why
was he called Nahum Gamzu? Because whatever happened to him he would
say: this too (gam-zu) is for the best.

Once the Israelites wished to send gifts to Caesar. After a consultation
they decided to send Nahum of Gamzu, because so many miracles had
happened to him. They entrusted into his hand a chest full of precious
stones and pearls: He then started on his journey; but

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

when he stayed overnight in one of the inns, robbers came and pilfered
his chest and filled it with earth. The next day when Nahum discovered
the loss, he said: This too is for the best. When he arrived at the
palace, the king wanted to kill him and all his men, for he said: The
Jews are jesting with me. Nahum, however, said: This too is for the
best. Then Elijah appeared, disguised as one of them, and said: Perhaps
this is some of the earth of their father Abraham, which turns into
swords when it is thrown against the enemy, for it is written: (*Isaiah*
xli, 2) *He gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to
his bow*. They tried it against the enemy of a province that could not
be conquered, but with the earth it was conquered this time. Whereupon
they brought Nahum into the palace, filled his chest full of precious
stones and pearls, and sent him home full of honors. On his return trip,
when he stopped again at the same inn he was asked: What did you bring
to the Emperor, that you were sent back with such great honor? He
answered: The things that I had taken with me from here. The people of
the inn then razed their house to the ground, and took the earth to
Caesar and said to him. The earth which that man brought you was ours.
They tested it and found it was worthless. Whereupon they put the
innkeeper and his men to death.

(*Gemara*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER III</span>

 

FIVE things befell our ancestors on the seventeenth of Tamuz, and five
on the ninth of Ab. On the seventeenth of Tamuz the Tablets were broken,
and the Daily-Offering ceased, and the city was taken by assault, and

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Apostomus burned
the *Torah*, and he put an image into the Temple. On the ninth of Ab it
was decreed that our ancestors be forbidden from entering the Land of
Israel, and the Temple was destroyed for the first and also for the
second time, and the City of Bethar was conquered, and the city was
ploughed up. When the month of Ab comes in, happiness should disappear.

 

RABBI Simon ben Gamaliel said: There were no better days in Israel then
the fifteenth of Ab and the Day of Atonement, for on them the daughters
of Jerusalem would go out in white garments that were borrowed, so as
not to shame those that had none of their own. All the garments had to
be washed first. And the daughters of Jerusalem would go out and dance
in the vineyards. And what would they say? Young man, lift up your eyes
and see what you would choose for yourself. Do not fix your eyes on
grace, but look to the family, for (*Proverbs* xxxi, 30) *Favor is
deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she
shall be praised*.
