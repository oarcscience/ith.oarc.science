### Law of Procedure

### (TRACTATE SANHEDRIN)

CASES concerning money matters are decided by three judges. Cases of
larceny and injury by three judges. Damages, half damages, double,
four-fold or five-fold payments by three judges. The violator, the
seducer, and the slanderer are judged by three. Thus, according to Rabbi
Meir; but the Sages say: Cases of libel should be judged by twenty-three
judges, because they may involve capital punishment. Cases punishable by
flogging are judged by three, but according to Rabbi Ishmael they should
be judged by twenty-three. . . . Redemption of sacred property by three;
Rabbi Yehuda says: One of the judges should be a priest. Real estate by
nine and a priest.

Cases involving capital punishment are judged by twenty-three, as are
cases of beasts and men who commit unnatural intercourse.

The ox that is to be stoned, by twenty-three, for it was said:
(*Leviticus* xxi, 29) *The ox shall be stoned and its owner shall be put
to death*. Those that have jurisdiction over the owner of the ox shall
judge the ox. The

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

wolf, the lion, the bear, the leopard, the panther, or the serpent,
their death is decided by twenty-three judges. A tribe, a false prophet,
or a High Priest is judged by a court of seventy-one.

An offensive war is not to be declared, except by the authority of a
court of seventy-one.

The Great Sanhedrin shall consist of seventy-one, while the Small
Sanhedrin shall consist of twenty-three.

(*Mishna*)

 

RABBI Aha ben Rabbi Ika says: According to the *Torah*, every one is
competent to pass on cases of indebtedness, for it was said:
(*Leviticus* xix, 15) *In righteousness thou shalt judge thy neighbor*.
But three are required, since they are laymen. For it is not likely that
no one of the three should have no knowledge whatsoever of law.

The Rabbis taught: Cases of money are decided by three. Rabbi says by a
vote of five, so that a majority decision may be rendered by three. But
when three sit can't there be a verdict rendered by a majority of two?
What Rabbi evidently meant was that there must be a concurring decision
of at least three. Rabbi Abahu poked fun at this: in that case the Great
Sanhedrin would have to be composed of one hundred and forty-one, so
that a majority decision of seventy-one could be rendered, and the Small
Sanhedrin would have to be composed of forty-five, so that a majority
decision of twenty-three could be rendered. But this is not so. The
Merciful said: (*Numbers* xi, 16) *Gather unto me seventy men, of the
elders of Israel*. Seventy at the time of gathering.

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

The Rabbis taught: Monetary cases are judged by three, but if one is an
experienced judge, he may render a decision alone. Rabbi Nahman said:
One, like me, may render a decision alone in a case involving money. And
so said Rabbi Hiya.

Come and hear: Mar Zutra the son of Rabbi Nahman judged a case and
rendered an erroneous decision. He came before Rabbi Joseph who told
him: If both litigants accepted you as their judge, you are not liable,
but if not, go and make restitution to the loser. From this it can be
inferred that the decision of an unauthorized judge is also valid.

Rab said: If one wishes to judge monetary cases alone, and does not wish
to incur liability, he must receive authorization from the Exilarch. And
thus said Rabbi Samuel also.

Rabbi Samuel ben Mansya said: If two litigants come before you, before
you have heard their case, or if you have heard it, and have not decided
to which side the verdict inclines, you may tell them: Go and
compromise; but if you have heard their case and have made up your mind
as to the verdict, you must not tell them to settle it by a compromise.

 

THE Rabbis taught: The calendar cannot be set save by a court especially
appointed for that purpose.

There was the case of Rabbi Gamaliel who ordered: Send up seven scholars
to my upper chamber for this purpose. When he came he found that there
were eight. He asked who came here without authorization? Whereupon
Samuel the Little arose and said: I am the one who came up here without
authorization, but I have come

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

not to intercalate the year but to learn how the law is applied in
practice. Said Rabbi Gamaliel: You may sit down, my son. You are worthy
that every year shall be intercalated by you. The Sages, however,
decided that the year may be lengthened only by a court appointed
specifically for that purpose.—But it was really not Samuel the Little
that had come unauthorized, but another. But because he did not want to
shame the other fellow, he arose.

 

IT HAPPENED once that while Rabbi was lecturing he smelled garlic. He
said: Whoever ate garlic, let him leave the room. Whereupon Rabbi Hiya
arose and left the room. Then all the other disciples arose one after
the other and left the room. Next morning Rabbi Hiya met Rabbi Simon,
the son of Rabbi, and was asked: Are you the one that annoyed my father
yesterday? He answered: A thing like this should never occur in Israel.

From whom did Rabbi Hiya learn to act like this?—From Rabbi Meir. It was
related that a woman came once to the academy of Rabbi Meir and said to
him: Rabbi, one of you betrothed me through intercourse. Whereupon the
Rabbi arose, wrote out a writ of divorce, and handed it to her.
Thereupon all the disciples arose and each in his turn gave her a writ
of divorce.

The Rabbis taught: A year may not be intercalated unless it is necessary
for the improvement of roads or the strengthening of bridges, or the
repair of the ovens for the Paschal Offering. Or because of the Pilgrims
who have left their homes, but have not yet arrived; but not because of
the snows or the cold, or the Pilgrims who have not as yet set out from
their homes.

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

RABBI Yohanan said: Only such are selected for the Sanhedrin as possess
stature, appearance, wisdom; and are ripe in years; as have a knowledge
of sorcery, and understand seventy languages, so that the Sanhedrin will
not have to employ interpreters.

Rabbi Yehuda said, in the name of Rab: In the city where one cannot find
two men who speak seventy languages and one who understands them, no
Sanhedrin should be appointed there. In the city of Bethar there were
three such men, and in Yabnah four: Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Joshua, Rabbi
Akiba, and Simon the Yemenite, who would discourse while sitting before
his masters on the floor.

(*Gemara*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER I</span>

 

THE High Priest may judge and may be judged. He may testify and others
may testify against him. *Halizah* may be performed upon him, and one
may submit to *Halizah* by his widow. He cannot contract levirate
marriage, for as a Priest he is forbidden to marry a widow. If someone
dies in his family, he must not follow the bier. If the bier appears
within his sight he must disappear. But he may follow the procession to
the gates of the city. Thus according to Rabbi Meir; but Rabbi Yehuda
says: He does not venture out of the Temple.

The King does not judge, and no one judges him. He does not testify and
one cannot testify against him. He does not submit to *Halizah*, nor
does his wife perform the rite to anyone. He does not contract levirate
marriage, nor does anyone contract levirate marriage

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

with his widow. Rabbi Yehuda says: If the King is willing to submit to
*Halizah*, or is willing to contract levirate marriage, he merits
praise.

(*Mishna*)

 

"THE High Priest may judge." Is not this quite obvious? This is stated
so that we may adduce that he may be judged. But this too is obvious.
For how could he judge if he cannot be judged? For it was written:
(*Zephania* ii, 1) *Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together*.
And Resh-Lakish explained: Adorn thyself and then adorn others. Further
we are taught: A King does not judge, and no one judges a King, so he
also teaches: "The High Priest may judge and may be judged." But if you
wish, we may say that what we are taught is really the following lesson:
If a High Priest killed anyone intentionally, he is sentenced to death,
but if he killed anyone unintentionally, he is exiled. If he
transgresses a positive or a negative command, in either case, he
receives the same treatment as any ordinary person.

The Rabbis said: Originally the mourner used to stand, while the people
passed by, but two families in Jerusalem fought with each other over the
privilege of passing first. So the Rabbis instituted the custom of the
people standing while the mourners pass by.

"The King does not judge", etc. Rabbi Joseph said: This refers only to
the Kings of Israel, but the Kings of the House of David may judge and
may be judged. For it was written: (*Jeremiah* xxi, 12) *Oh House of
David, thus said the Lord; Execute judgment in the morning*. And if the
King could not be judged, how could he judge others? Was it not written
"Gather and

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

be gathered" which, as Resh-Lakish explained, meant "Adorn thyself and
then adorn others?" But why not the Kings of Israel? Because of the case
of a slave of King Yanai who once killed a man. Simon ben Shetah said to
the Sages: Mark the man, and we shall take him to court. They sent word
to the King saying: "Your slave has killed a man." He sent the slave to
them. They sent word to him: "Thou too must come", for the law says:
(*Exodus* xxi, 29) *If it hath been testified to his owners*. The owner
of the ox must come and stand by his ox. The King came to court and sat
down. Then Simon ben Shetah said to him: Stand on thy feet, King Yanai,
and let the witnesses testify against thee. Thou art not standing before
us, but before Him who spoke and the world was created, art thou
standing. As it was written: (*Deuteronomy* xix, 17) *Then both the men,
between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the Lord*. Said the
King, "I shall not do as thou sayest, but as thy colleagues say". Simon
then turned to his right and saw that they all were looking to the
ground. He turned to the left and saw that there, too, all were looking
to the ground. Said Simon ben Shetah to them, "Are all of you engrossed
in thought? Then let the Master of thought come and call you to
account". Instantly Gabriel appeared and smote them to the ground, and
they died. Right there and then it was decreed that a King does not
judge, and no one judges a King. He does not testify, and no one may
testify against him.

(*Gemara*)

 

THE King may set forth to a voluntary war only upon the decision of a
court of seventy-one. He has

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

right of domain to establish a road through private property and no one
may protest against him. The King's road has no limit. Whatever the
people plunder, they must set before him and he takes the first portion.

No one may ride on the King's horse, nor sit on his throne, and no one
may make use of his sceptre. No one may gaze upon him while he is having
his hair cut, or when he is naked, or when he is in the bath house. For
it was said: (*Deuteronomy* xvii, 15) *Thou shalt in everywise set him
King over thee. His awe shall be over thee*.

(*Mishna*)

 

RAB Yehuda said in the name of Samuel: All that is said in the chapter
of the King, the King may do. Rab said: This whole chapter was brought
forth only for the purpose of inspiring awe for him among the people.

 

MAR Zutra, and some say it was Mar Ukba, said: Originally the *Torah*
was given to the Israelites in Hebrew script and in the Holy Hebrew
tongue. Later it was given to them, in the day of Ezra, in the Assyrian
script and in the Aramaic tongue. The Israelites then selected the
Assyrian script and the Holy tongue, and left the Hebrew script and the
Aramaic language for the laymen.

 

RABBI Jacob said in the name of Rabbi Yohanan: Abishag was allowed to be
married to King Solomon, but she was not allowed to Adoniyah. She was
allowed to Solomon because he was King, and the King may make use of the
King's sceptre. But she was not allowed to Adoniyah because he was an
ordinary citizen.

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

Said Rabbi Shaman ben Aba: See how hard divorcing was made! King David
was allowed to marry Abishag, but he was not allowed to divorce any of
his wives.

Rabbi Eliezer said: When a man divorces his wife, even the altar sheds
tears for him.

Rabbi Alexandri said: A man whose wife dies while he is alive, is as if
the world darkened about him.

Rabbi Samuel ben Nahman said: Everything can be replaced but the wife of
one's youth. For it was said: (*Isaiah* liv, 6) *And a wife of youth,
when thou wast refused*.

Rab Yehuda lectured his son Isaac: A man finds joy only with his first
wife. For it was said: (*Prov*. v, 18) *Let thy fountain be blessed: and
rejoice with the wife of thy youth*.

(*Gemara*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER II</span>

 

MONETARY cases are judged by three; each litigant selects one judge and
then both together select one. Thus says Rabbi Meir, but the Sages say:
The two judges select a third. Each litigant may reject the judge
selected by the other. Thus says Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say: The
judges may be rejected only if they are related to a litigant or are
otherwise disqualified. But if the judges are eligible or are experts
they cannot be rejected. Each may reject the witnesses of the other.
Thus says Rabbi Meir, but the Sages say: A witness may be rejected if he
is a relative or otherwise ineligible, but if they are eligible they may
not be disqualified. The following are ineligible: dice-players,
usurers, pigeon-fliers, and dealers in produce of the seventh year.

(*Mishna*)

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

WHAT sin does a dice player commit? Said Rammi ben Hamma: Because the
game is a speculation, and a speculation cannot be binding by law, and
thus he receives ill-gotten money. Rabbi Shesheth said: It is not a
question of speculation. The reason is, that gamblers are not concerned
with the welfare of the people.

Pigeon-fliers. Who is called a pigeon-flier? Here it was explained: A
man who says: If your pigeon overtakes mine, you win.

Rabbi Nahman said: One who is suspected of incest is eligible as a
witness. Said Rabbi Shesheth: Rabbi, he deserves forty lashes but is
still eligible as a witness? Said Raba: Rabbi Nahman admits that he is
not eligible as a witness in matrimonial cases. Rabina or Rab Papa said:
He is not eligible as a witness in a divorce case, but he may be a
witness where marriage is concerned.

(*Gemara*)

 

HOW are witnesses examined? They used to bring them into a room and they
admonished them. Then all were sent out, but one, the eldest, was left,
and he was asked: How do you know that so-and-so is indebted to
so-and-so? If he answered: He told me "I am indebted to him" or
"So-and-so told me that he is indebted to him",—it means nothing. He
must say: In our presence he admitted to him that he owes him two
hundred *zuz*. Then they bring in the second witness and he is examined.
If they find that their statements agree, the judges discuss the matter.
If two say he is not guilty, and one says he is guilty; then he is not
guilty. If two say he is guilty and one says he is not guilty, then he
is guilty.

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> If one says,
"Guilty" and one says, "Not Guilty", or if two say, "Guilty" or two say,
"Not Guilty", and one says, "I have no opinion", they must add to the
judges.

When the judges were finished with their work, the litigants were
admitted and the senior judge would announce: "So-and-so, you are
guilty", or "So-and-so, you are not guilty". And whence do we know that
when one of the judges goes out he must not say: "I said 'Not guilty'
but my colleagues said 'Guilty', what could I do? They were in the
majority". Of such a one it was said: (*Lev*. xix, 16) *Thou shalt not
go up and down as a talebearer among thy people*. And it was also said:
(*Prov*. xi, 13) *A talebearer revealeth secrets*.

(*Mishna*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER III</span>

 

THE same procedure applies to capital cases as to monetary cases. For it
was said: (*Lev*. xxiv, 22) *Ye shall have one manner of law*. What is
the difference between monetary cases and capital cases? Monetary cases
are judged by three, while capital cases are judged by twenty-three.
Monetary cases can be opened for acquittal or for conviction, but
capital cases must be opened with motions for acquittal and must not be
opened with motions for conviction. Monetary cases may be decided by a
majority of one for conviction or for acquittal, but capital cases may
be decided for acquittal by a majority of one, but for conviction they
must be decided by at least a majority of two. In monetary cases the
decision may be reversed for either conviction or acquittal. But in
capital cases, it may be reversed if a man was convicted but if he was
acquitted, it cannot be reversed. In monetary cases everyone may argue
for conviction or for acquittal,

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

but in capital cases everyone may argue for acquittal, but not everyone
may argue for conviction.

Everyone is eligible to try monetary cases, but not everyone is eligible
to try capital cases, only priests, levites and Israelites who are
worthy of contracting marriages with priests.

(*Mishna*)

 

RABBI Hanina said: According to the Torah, there is but one law, which
applies alike to monetary and capital cases; and the methods of
procedure as regards inquiry and investigation are the same. For it was
written: (*Leviticus* xxiv, 22) *Ye shall have one manner of law*. But
what is the reason that it was decided to have the procedure different
in capital cases from that in monetary cases? It was done so that the
door would not be locked for borrowers. Then if the judges should err
they should not be held responsible.—Then surely the doors would be
locked for the borrowers.

 

Raba said: The Mishna refers to cases of fines, while Rabbi Hanina
refers to cases of loans and admissions.

(*Gemara*)

 

THE Sanhedrin was arranged like a half a circular threshing floor so
that the judges could see one another, and the scribes of the court
stand before them; one to the right and one to the left of them. They
write down the testimony for conviction and for acquittal. Rabbi Yehuda
said: Three scribes; one writes down the testimony for acquittal, one
writes down the testimony for conviction, while the third writes down
the testimony both for conviction and for acquittal.

Three rows of disciples of the Sages sat before

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

them; each one had his designated place. If an additional judge was
needed they appointed one from the first row, and one of the second row
took a place in the first, and one from the third row went to the
second, while one from the public was selected and seated in the third
row. He was not seated in the place of the former, but in a place that
was proper for him.

How were witnesses admonished? In capital cases they brought them in and
said to them: Perhaps what you want to say is only supposition or
hearsay, or testimony from the mouth of an eye-witness or from a
truthful person? Do you know that we shall search and inquire and
examine you, and do you know that capital cases are not like monetary
cases? In monetary cases a man can repay the money and the error be
forgiven, but in capital cases the blood of the convicted and of his
potential seed to the end of time are upon you.

Perhaps they will say: What do we want with all this trouble?—Was it not
once said: (*Leviticus* v, 1) *And is a witness, whether he hath seen or
known of it; if he do not utter it*. And if you should say: Why should
we be guilty of the man's blood? Was it however not said: (*Prov*. xi,
10) *When the wicked perish, there is shouting*.

(*Mishna*)

 

THE Rabbis taught: What is supposition? The judge said to them: Perhaps
it was like this: You saw a man pursuing another fellow into a ruin and
you ran after him. You found a sword in his hand and blood trickling
from it, and a murdered man was in the throes of death. If that is what
you saw—you saw nothing.

Though the Sanhedrin was abolished after the destruction

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

of the temple, the four methods of execution were not abolished. How so?
They surely were abolished.—The law of the four deaths was not
abolished. Those who merited death by stoning, died by falling from a
roof or by being trampled to death by wild beasts. Those who merited
death by fire, died by perishing in a fire or by a bite from a serpent.
Those who merited death by the sword were either handed to the
government or robbers beset and killed them. Those who merited death by
strangulation, died by drowning in a river. or by suffocating.

 

THE Rabbis taught: Man was created one. And why? So that the heretics
would not say: There are many Lords in heaven. Another reason is that he
was created thus for the sake of the righteous and the evil. So that the
righteous might not say, we are the children of the righteous, and the
evil might not say, we are the children of the evil. Another explanation
is that it was done for the sake of the families, so that the families
might not quarrel one with another. Now that man was created one, the
families quarrel one with another; how much more would they quarrel if
there had been two created.

The Rabbis taught: Man was created one to proclaim the greatness of our
Lord, the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He. For a man stamps
many coins with one mould, and each one resembles the other, but the
Holy One, blessed be He, stamps each man from the mould of the first
man, and not one resembles the other.

Rabbi Meir used to say: In three things a man differs from his fellow
man: In voice, in looks, and in mind. In

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

voice and in looks for the sake of avoiding incest, and in mind because
of robbers and extortioners.

Man was created on Sabbath eve so that heretics might not say that the
Holy One, blessed be He, had partners in the creation of the world.
Another explanation is that if man gets over-haughty, he may be reminded
that the smallest insect preceded him in creation.

 

ONCE the Emperor said to Rabbi Gamaliel: Your God is a thief. For it is
written: (*Genesis* ii, 21) *And the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall
upon Adam and he slept*, etc. The Emperor's daughter interrupted: "Leave
him to me and I will answer him." Whereupon she said to the Emperor:
"Let me have a duke." "What need have you of a duke?"—She answered:
"Robbers came last night and took from us a silver chalice and left in
its stead a gold one." Said the King: "I wish that they would come to us
like that every day." "Was not Adam satisfied that they took a rib from
him, and in its stead gave him a maid to wait upon him?" "Well", replied
the King, "what I mean to say is that they could have taken the rib
openly." She answered: "Give me a piece of raw meat." When the piece of
meat was given to her she put it under her armpit. After a while she
took it out and put it before the Emperor and said: "Eat of it." He
answered: "It is disgusting." Whereupon she said: "Had they taken the
rib openly from Adam, Eve would have been disgusting to Adam."

The Emperor said to Rabbi Gamaliel: I know what your God is doing in
heaven and where he sits. Whereupon Rabbi Gamaliel sighed and seemed
worried. What is the matter? asked the Emperor. Rabbi Gamaliel answered:

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I have a son in
the lands overseas, and I am yearning for him. I wish you would tell me
about him. Do I know where he is? said the Emperor. Whereupon Rabbi
Gamaliel replied: What is going on upon this earth you know not, yet you
seem to know what goes on in heaven.

The Emperor said once to Rabbi Gamaliel: "It is written: (*Psalm*
cxlvii, 4) *He telleth the number of the stars*, etc. What is so
remarkable about this? I too can count the stars." Whereupon Rabbi
Gamaliel put some quinces into a sieve and spun it around and said to
the Emperor: "Count them."—"Hold them still", said the Emperor.—"The
stars in heaven are revolving, too", said Rabbi Gamaliel.

Once the Emperor said to Rabbi Tanhum: "Let us all become one people."
"That is fine", said Rabbi Tan-hum, "but we who are circumcised cannot
become like you. Therefore you must become circumcised, and become like
us." The Emperor answered: "You spoke well, but whoever wins in an
argument with the Emperor is thrown into the arena." Whereupon he was
thrown into the arena but he was not devoured. Then one of the heretics
said: "They did not eat him because they are not hungry." So they threw
the heretic in, and he was devoured instantly.

(*Gemara*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER IV</span>

 

IF THE judges find that the witnesses agreed in their evidence they
begin with the arguments in favor of the accused. If one of the
witnesses arises and says: I have something in favor of the accused, and
then one of the disciples arises and says: "I have something to argue

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

for his conviction," the disciple is silenced. But if one of the
disciples says: "I have something in favor of the accused", he is told
to come up and sit with the judges, and he remains there all day. If he
has something pertinent to say, they listen to him. If the defendant
arises and says, I have something to argue in my own defense, they
listen to him, but make sure his words are pertinent to the case.

If they acquitted him, he is set free; but if they found him guilty,
they hold the sentence over till the next day. During the day they
gather in pairs, they eat little, and drink no wine the whole day, and
they discuss the case all night long. The next morning they rise and go
to court early. The one who voted for acquittal says: I voted for his
acquittal and I stand now for his acquittal. The one who was for
conviction says: I voted for his conviction and I still stand for his
conviction. One who was for conviction may now favor acquittal, but one
who voted for acquittal must not change his stand. If they erred in
something, the two scribes remind them of it. If they acquitted him, he
is set free; but if not, they take a vote. If twelve are for acquittal,
while eleven are for conviction, he is acquitted. If twelve are for
conviction and eleven are for acquittal, or even if eleven are for
acquittal and eleven are for conviction, while one says I know not, they
must add to the judges. How many do they add? By pairs till seventy-one.
If thirty-six are for acquittal and thirty-five are for conviction, he
is acquitted. If thirty-six are for conviction, while thirty-five are
for acquittal, the two sides argue the case till one of those who voted
for conviction sees his way to vote for the acquittal.

(*Mishna*)

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

RABBI Hisda said: If one says he killed him with a sword while another
says he killed him with a dagger, the evidence is contradictory. If one
says: His garments were white, while another says his garments were
black, their evidence is not held contradictory.

This was objected to. "Certain" means "certain". If one says: He killed
him with a sword, while another says he killed him with a dagger, or one
said his garments were white; the evidence surely is not certain. Rabbi
Hisda explained: This refers to garments with which a man was strangled,
in which case they are in the same category as the sword and the dagger.

"The two sides discuss, etc." But if they cannot agree, Rabbi Aha says:
He is set free. And thus said Rabbi Yohanan: He is set free. Said Rab
Papa to Abaya: Then why did they not set him free in the first place?
Said Abaya: Rabbi Yohanan explained that this is done, so that the court
will not be adjourned in confusion. Some say that Rab Papa said to
Abaya: Why add to the judges? Let the original court discharge him. To
which Abaya answered: Rabbi Yosi is of your opinion. For we were taught:
Rabbi Yosi says: Just as a court of seventy-one is not increased, thus
we need not add to a court of twenty-three.

(*Gemara*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER V</span>

 

WHEN the trial is over, the guilty is brought out to be stoned. The
place of stoning is situated outside the court house. For it was said:
(*Lev*. xxiv, 14) *Bring forth him that hath cursed*. One man stands at
the door with a scarf in his hand, while another man sits on a horse in
the distance but so that the man at the door can

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

see him. If someone comes and says: I have something in favor of the
condemned, the man at the door waves the scarf and the horseman runs and
stops the condemned. Even if the condemned says: I have something to say
in my favor, he is brought back to court. Even if it is four or five
times, he is brought back, provided he has something pertinent to the
case.

(*Mishna*)

 

"ONE man stands, etc." It is very clear that the stone with which a man
is to be stoned, the gallows on which a man is to be hanged, and the
sword with which he is to be put to death or the cloth with which he is
to be strangled are all furnished by the community. Indeed, one cannot
say to the condemned that he should furnish the necessary things and put
himself to death. But then Rab Huna asked: Who furnishes the scarf and
the horse? These are for the purpose of saving the man. Or should they
be furnished at the expense of the court, since the court is duty bound
to endeavor to save him? Furthermore, said Rabbi Hiya ben Ashi in the
name of Rab Hisda: When a man is led out to be executed he is to be
given a cup of drugged wine so as to becloud his spirit. For it was
said: (*Prov*. xxxi, 6) *Give strong drink unto him that is ready to
perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts*. And it was said
that compassionate souls in Jerusalem used to donate and bring these
things. But if the women did not furnish them, at whose cost then were
they furnished? It is quite evident from this that they must be
furnished at public cost.

IF THEY found something for his acquittal, he is set free, but if not he
is led out to be stoned. A herald goes before him and calls: So-and-so
is being led to be stoned for such-and-such an offense; such-and-such
were his witnesses. Anyone that may know anything in his favor shall
come and plead for him.

(*Mishna*)

 

ABAYA said: They must also say: The crime was committed on such-and-such
a day, at such-and-such an hour, at such-and-such a place. So that if
one can prove that the witnesses testified falsely, he may come and do
so.

"And a herald goes before him." This means right before the execution,
but not previously.

(*Gemara*)

 

WHEN he was about ten ells from the place of stoning, they would say to
him: Make your confession. That was the way with all who were to be
executed. They would make their confession. For he who makes his
confession has a share in the world to come.

When he was four ells from the place of stoning they took off his
clothes. The men were covered in front while the women were covered
front and back. So said Rabbi Yehuda, but the Sages said: A man is
stoned naked, but a woman is not stoned naked.

When the flesh was decomposed, the bones were gathered and were buried
in their own place. The relatives came and greeted the judges and the
witnesses, as if to say: We bear no grudge against you. You have brought
in a just verdict. They did not go into mourning for the executed, but
they grieved over him, for grief is a matter of the heart.

(*Mishna*)

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

IF A man breaks into a house, he is judged according to the consequences
that might have occurred. If he broke a barrel while breaking in and
this caused bloodshed, he is guilty, but if there was no bloodshed he is
not guilty.

(*Mishna*)

 

WHAT is the reason for the law of breaking in? Because a man will surely
defend his property. So the thief reasons: If I break in, the owner will
surely oppose me and will prevent me from stealing. But if he opposes
me, I shall kill him. Therefore the law states: If one wants to kill
you, you can forestall this by killing him.

(*Gemara*)

 

THE following should be saved from committing sin, even at the cost of
their lives: he who pursues after his neighbor to kill him; he who is
after a male or after a girl who is betrothed. But he who pursues after
a beast, he who desecrates the Sabbath or he who commits idolatry, these
are not saved from committing sin at the cost of their lives.

(*Mishna*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER VIII</span>

 

HOW do Abaya and Rab interpret the verse: (*Lev*. xix, 29) *Do not
prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore?* Rabbi Mani says:
They mean a man who marries off his daughter to an old man. As we have
learned: "*Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore*."

Rabbi Eliezer says: This means one who marries off

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

his daughter to an old man. Rabbi Akiba says: This means a man who lets
his marriageable daughter sit and wait.

Said Rabbi Kahana in the name of Rabbi Akiba: There is no poor man in
Israel except the subtly wicked, and the one who lets his marriageable
daughter sit. But is not one who lets his marriageable daughter sit, a
subtly wicked man? This is the meaning: Which poor man is subtly wicked?
He who lets his marriageable daughter sit and wait.

(*Gemara*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER IX</span>

 

THE following are strangled: He who strikes his father or his mother; he
who steals a soul in Israel; an Elder who rebels against the decision of
the court; a false prophet; he who prophesies in the name of a pagan
god; he who violates another man's wife, and he who bears false
testimony against a priest's daughter and her paramour.

An Elder who rebels against the decision of the court. It was said:
(*Deut*. xvii, 8) *If there arise a matter too hard for thee in
judgment*. There were three courts. One sat at the entrance of the
Temple Mount. One sat at the gate of Temple Court and one sat in the
chamber of the Hewn Stones. They would come to the court at the entrance
of the Temple Mount and say: So I expounded, and thus expounded my
colleagues; so I taught and thus taught my colleagues. If the judges
knew anything about the problem, they enlightened them, but if not they
went to the court at the gate of the Temple Court, and there propounded
their problem. If these judges knew anything about it, they enlightened
them. If not,

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

they all went to the great court at the chamber of the Hewn Stones
whence the laws were issued for the whole people of Israel.

(*Mishna*)

 

THE Elder who rebels is guilty of a deliberate sin, which is punishable
by extirpation; but if he sinned through error, he brings a sin
offering. These are the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: He is
guilty for transgression against a law that is rooted in the Torah, but
its interpretation is made by the scribes. Rabbi Simon says: He is
guilty even for transgressing only one detail of the interpretation of
the scribes.

"Three courts, etc." Said Rabbi Kahana: If the elder gives a ruling
based upon tradition and the court says: We base our ruling on
tradition, he is not executed. If he says: That is how it appears to me
and they say: That is how it appears to us, he is not executed. So much
the more if he says: "My ruling is based on tradition", while they say:
"So it appears to us." He is not executed unless he says: "This is how
it appears to me", while they say: "We base our ruling on tradition."
This can be deduced from the fact that Akiba ben Mahalael was not
executed. Rabbi Eliezer said: Though the elder says: My ruling is based
on tradition, while they say: This is how it appears to us; he is
executed. Because controversy must not spread in Israel.

But why was not Akiba ben Mahalael executed? Because he did not give his
ruling for the purpose of practical application. We were taught: So I
taught and so taught my colleagues. Does this not mean that he said: I
base my ruling on tradition and they say: That is how

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

it appears to us?—No, he said, that is how it appeared to me, while they
say, Our ruling is based on tradition.

Come and hear. Rabbi Josiah said: Three things were told to me by Zeira
in the name of the man from Jerusalem. When a husband withdraws his
warning, it is void. A rebellious son whom the parents are willing to
forgive is forgiven. A rebellious elder, whom the court wishes to
forgive, is forgiven. But when I came to the South, they agreed to the
first two, but they did not agree as to the rebellious elder, because
controversy must not be spread in Israel.

At first there were not many quarrels in Israel. The court of
seventy-one sat in the Hall of Hewn Stones, and the two courts of
twenty-three sat, one at the entrance of the Temple Mount, and the other
at the gate of Temple Court. While other courts of twenty-three sat in
all cities of Israel. If a problem arose, it was asked of the local
court. If they knew of a traditional ruling, they gave it. If not, they
asked a ruling from a court in the nearest city. If they knew of a
traditional ruling, they gave it; if not, they went to the court at the
Temple Mount. If they knew the ruling, they gave it; if not, they went
to the court at the gate of the Temple Court. The judges would say: So I
expounded and so expounded my colleagues; so I taught and so taught my
colleagues. If they knew of a traditional ruling, they gave it; if not,
they all went to the court at the Hall of Hewn Stones, where they
convened from early in the morning till evening. And on the Sabbath and
Festival days they sat on the *hel*. The problem was then stated to
them. If they knew the ruling, they gave it to them, if not, they took a
vote. If the majority said it was "clean", it was declared

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "clean"; if the
majority voted "unclean", it was declared "unclean". But when the
disciples of the Houses of Hillel and Shamai, who were not very
experienced, multiplied, the quarrels began to spread, and the Law
became like two Laws. From there communications were written and sent to
all places. Whoever was wise and modest and enjoyed the esteem of his
fellow townsmen was appointed as local judge. From there he was elevated
to the court at the Temple Mount and from there to the court at the
Gate, and from there to the court at the Hall of Hewn Stones.

(*Gemara*)

 

MORE emphasis is placed on the words of the scribes than on the words of
the *Torah*. If a man says: There is no need of phylacteries, he is
transgressing a precept of the *Torah*, and he is not guilty; but if he
says the phylacteries must have five compartments, thus he adds to the
words of the scribes, and he is guilty.

(*Mishna*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER X</span>

 

ALL of Israel have a share in the world to come, for it was said:
(*Isaiah* lx, 21) *Thy people also shall be all righteous: They shall
inherit the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my
hands, that I may be glorified*. And the following have no share in the
world to come. He that says that no resurrection is stated in the Bible;
he that says that the Bible does not come from Heaven. The heretic.
Rabbi Akiba said: also he that reads proscribed books, and he that
whispers charms over a wound and says: (*Exodus* xv, 26) *I will put
none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought* 

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

*upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee*. Abba Saul
says: He also who pronounces the Name of the Lord with all of its
letters.

(*Mishna*)

 

SAID Rabbi Yohanan: Where is a resurrection indicated in the Bible?—It
was said: (*Numbers* xviii, 28) *And ye shall give thereof the Lord's
heave offering to Aaron the priest*. Does Aaron live forever? Why, he
did not even enter the land of Israel. Can the offering then be given to
him? This means that he is to be resurrected, and Israel will give him
the offering. From this we infer that resurrection is indicated in the
Torah. The school of Rabbi Ishmael taught: To Aaron, means as Aaron. As
Aaron was a scholar, so his sons are to be considered scholars. Rabbi
Samuel ben Nahman said in the name of Rabbi Jonathan: How do we know
that the offering must not be given to a priest who is ignorant? (*II
Chronicles*, xxxi, 4) *Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in
Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they
might be encouraged in the law of the Lord*. He who holds to the Law of
the Lord has a share: whoever does not hold to the Law has no share.
Said Rab Aha ben Adda in the name of Rab Yehuda: Whoever gives the
Offering to an ignorant priest is as if he had given it to a lion. Just
as of a lion we are not sure whether he will tear and eat it, or will
not tear and eat it, so of an ignorant priest we are not sure whether he
will eat it in cleanliness or in uncleanliness. Rabbi Yohanan says: One
may even cause him death. For it was said: (*Lev*. xxii, 9) *And die
therefore, if they profane it*. The school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob
taught: He also leads him into transgression, for

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

it was said: (*Lev*. xxii, 16) *Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of
trespass when they eat their holy things*.

Rabbi Simai said: How do we infer resurrection from the Bible?—For it
was said: (*Exodus* vi, 4) *And I have also established my covenant with
them, to give them the land of Canaan*. It is not said to you, but to
them. From this, too, we infer resurrection is indicated in the *Torah*.

Rabbi Gamaliel was asked by the Saducees: Whence do we know that the
Lord will resurrect the dead? He answered them: From the *Torah*, the
Prophets and the Hagiographa; but they would not accept it. From the
*Torah*, for it is written: (*Deut*. xxxi, 16) *And the Lord said unto
Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers and rise up*. But, said
they to him: Do we not read: And this people will rise up? From the
Prophets (*Isaiah* xxvi, 19): *Thy dead men shall live, together with my
dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for
thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the
dead*.—Perhaps those are the dead that Ezekiel resurrected? From the
Hagiographa, as is written: (*Cant*. vii, 9) *And the roof of thy mouth
like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the
lips of those that are asleep to speak*. Perhaps this means only that
the lips were moving. This is according to Rabbi Yohanan, for Rabbi
Yohanan taught, in the name of Rabbi Yehozadak: If a ruling is quoted in
the name of one departed, his lips whisper in his grave. For it was
said: *Causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak*. Not until he
quoted to them the following verse: (*Deut*. xi, 21) *Which the Lord
sware unto your fathers to give them*. It is not said to "you",

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

but to "them". Thus resurrection is stated in the Torah. Others say, he
quoted the following verse: (*Deut*. iv, 4) *But ye that did cleave unto
the Lord, your God, are alive every one of you this day*. As you are
alive today, even though those that live today shall be dead, you will
be alive. As you are alive today, so will you be alive in the world to
come.

Queen Cleopatra asked of Rabbi Meir: I know that the dead shall be
resurrected, for it is written: (*Psalms* lxxii, 16) *And they of the
city shall flourish like grass of the earth*. Will they arise naked or
garbed? He answered: This is deduced by *a fortiori* argument from a
grain of wheat: While a grain of wheat is put into the ground naked, it
emerges in many garbs. The righteous who are buried in their garments
will so much the more arise dressed.

Caesar said to Rabbi Gamaliel: You say that the dead will come to life
again, but the dead turn to dust. How can dust come to life again? Said
the emperor's daughter: Let me answer him: We have two pottery makers in
our town. One moulds from water; the other from clay. Which one is the
more praiseworthy? Said Caesar: The one who moulds from water. If he can
mould from water, he surely can mould from clay, answered his daughter.

A heretic said once to Rabbi Ammi: You say that the dead will arise
again, but the dead turn to dust. How can they arise again? He answered:
I will tell you a fable: This is like unto a King of flesh and blood who
said to his servants: Go and build for me a great Palace in a place
where there is no earth nor water. They went and they built him a
palace, but in a few days the palace

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

collapsed. Thereupon the King commanded them to build him a palace in a
place where there was earth and water. This we cannot do they said. The
King scolded them: In a place where there was no earth and no water, you
built a palace; but in a place where there is earth and water you surely
can build. But if you don't believe, go into the dale and observe the
mouse. Today half of it is dust and half flesh. On the morrow it is all
developed, and is entirely of flesh. But if you should say that this
takes a long time, go into the mountains and you will find a single
snail. On the morrow a rain will fall, and the place will be filled with
snails.

A heretic said once to Gebiha ben Pesisa: "Woe unto you, you wicked
people! You say that the dead will live again. If even those who are
alive shall die, how shall the dead live?" He replied: "Woe unto you,
you wicked people! You say that the dead will not live again. If those
who do not exist as yet, will live, how much more shall those live who
exist now?" "You call me wicked," said the heretic—"If I give you a kick
I'll knock the hump off your back." "If you would do that," replied ben
Pesisa, "you would be known as a great physician and you would receive a
large fee."

 

THE Rabbis said: There was a story of two men who were taken captive on
Mount Carmel, and the captor walked behind them. Said one of them to the
other: The camel that is walking in front of us is blind in one eye. It
is loaded with two kegs; one is filled with wine, the other with oil. Of
the two men that are leading it one is a Jew and one is a heathen. "You
stiff-necked people"—said the captor to them—"How do you know all

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

this?" They answered: The camel eats the grass on the side that it can
see; on the side it cannot see, it does not eat. It is loaded with two
kegs one of wine and one of oil. Wine drips and sinks into the ground,
while oil drips and remains on the surface. And the two men that are
leading it, one is a Jew, the other a heathen. The heathen attends to
his call of nature in the middle of the road, while the Jew steps aside.
He ran after them and found that it was really so. He came back and
kissed his captives, and made them guests in his home.
