### Oaths

### (<span class="smallcaps">Tractate Shebuoth</span>)

THERE are two kinds of oaths; these are subdivided into four. Knowledge
of being unclean is of two kinds, which are subdivided into four.
Carrying burdens on the Sabbath is of two kinds, which are really four.
The symptoms of leprosy are two, which are subdivided into four.

(*Mishna*)

 

NOW, the author has just finished the tractate "*Macoth*", why does he
begin with the tractate of "Oaths"?—Because there he taught: For the
cutting of the hair around the corners of the head one is punished with
two lashes, one for each side. For the shaving of the beard one is
punished: twice for each side of the face and once for under the chin.
Because he is discussing here one transgression that merits two
punishments, therefore he continues with two kinds of Oaths, that are
subdivided into four.—Why does the author treat only here, of all the
laws of "two that are subdivided into

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

four"? Why didn't he treat of the carrying of burdens on the Sabbath and
of the symptoms of leprosy in the tractates where they belong?—I will
tell you: The laws of oaths and knowledge of being unclean are mentioned
in the Bible in the same place, and are similar to each other in that
they merit a "Rising and Falling Offering". The author then began here
with the laws of oaths, and also with the laws of uncleanliness, and
having treated of them here, and since there are but a few of these
laws, he disposes of all of them here at one time. Then he proceeds to
the laws of oaths, which are many.

There are two kinds of oaths, these are subdivided into four. Two: I
shall eat; I shall not eat. These are subdivided into four: I have
eaten; I have not eaten. There are two kinds of knowledge of being
unclean, which are subdivided into four. Two: The knowledge of being
unclean while eating holy food, and the knowledge of being unclean while
having entered the sanctuary. These are subdivided into four: Knowledge
of being unclean, and knowledge of eating holy food, knowledge of being
unclean, and knowledge of entering the sanctuary.

The symptoms of leprosy are two, which are subdivided into four. A boil
and a bright spot. The boil and its species and the bright spot and its
species.

Who is the author of this *Mishna?*—It is not Rabbi Ishmael, nor is it
Rabbi Akiba. It is not Rabbi Ishmael for he says that only one who makes
an oath in the future tense is liable. And it is not Rabbi Akiba who
says: He is liable only if he forgets that he is unclean, but is not
liable if he forgot that he entered the sanctuary.

If you wish I may say that the author of this *Mishna* is Rabbi Ishmael,
and if you wish I may say that it is

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rabbi Akiba. It
may be Rabbi Ishmael, for one is liable for some of the oaths, and is
held not liable for other oaths. And it may be Rabbi Akiba, for again
for some of the oaths one is liable, while for others one is not
liable.—How not liable? Does not the author teach of all of them,
together with the laws applying to the symptoms of leprosy: just as in
these, one is liable in all the four subdivisions, so in the case of
oaths, is not one liable in all instances?—Indeed, the author is
probably Rabbi Ishmael; and though in the case of the oaths, he does not
hold liable one who made the oath in the past tense, he frees him only
from bringing a sacrifice, but he holds him liable to lashes. This is in
accord with Raba, who said: The *Torah* plainly states that a false oath
is the same as a vain oath; just as a vain oath is of necessity in the
past, so also is a false oath in the past tense. The author of this
*Mishna* is its compiler, Rabbi. In one instance he accepted the opinion
of one of the Rabbis, while later on he adopted the decision of a
different Rabbi.

(*Gemara*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER I</span>

 

IF ONE said: "I swear that I shall not eat", and he ate and drank, he is
liable only once. If he swore: "I shall not eat and I shall not drink",
and he ate and drank; he is liable twice. If he swore that he would not
eat, and he ate a piece of wheaten bread, and a piece of barley bread,
and a piece of bread made of spelt, he is liable only once. If he swore
that he would not eat wheat bread, barley bread, and spelt bread, and he
ate them, he is liable for each one of them separately.

If he swore that he would not eat, and ate things

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

which are not fit to be eaten, and he drank liquids which are not fit
for drinking, he is not held liable. If he swore that he would not eat,
and ate carrion, or unkosher food, or forbidden animals, or reptiles, he
is liable. But Rabbi Simon says: He is not liable. If he says: "*Konam*
(sacred); I shall not enjoy my wife if I have eaten today", and he ate
carrion, unkosher food, forbidden animals, or reptiles, his wife is
forbidden to him.

(*Mishna*)

 

RABBI Hiya ben Abin said in the name of Samuel: If a man said: "I swear
I shall not eat," but he drank, he is guilty. If you wish, I can prove
it to you by logic and if you wish I can prove it to you from the
*Scriptures*. If you wish, I can prove it to you by logic, for if one
says to his friend: "Let's partake of something" they go in and eat and
drink. And if you wish, I can prove to you from the *Scriptures* that
drinking is included in eating. For it was said: (*Deuteronomy* xiv, 23)
*And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place which he shall
choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine*.
*Tirosh* is wine, and yet it is written: "*Thou shalt eat*." Possibly
the *Scripture* means when one dips his bread in it. For Samuel said:
Wine sauce is prepared with almonds and juices of other vegetables.
Furthermore Rabbi Aha bar Jacob explained: Can this be deduced from the
following verse: (*Deuteronomy* xiv, 26) *And thou shalt bestow that
money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or
for wine, or for strong drink*. Wine is a drink, yet here "eating" is
used.—Perhaps it means in wine sauce? It is said "strong drink" which
means something that intoxicates.

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And perhaps a
pressed fig is meant, for it was taught: If he ate a pressed fig and ate
honey and milk and had then entered the Temple and performed the
service, he is liable.—Furthermore we deduce that drinking includes
eating, from the words "strong drink" which is used in the case of the
Nazirite, just as it means wine there, so it also means wine here.

(*Gemara*)

 

WHAT is a vain oath?—If he swore of something that is contrary to what
is well known to all men. For instance: he said of a pillar of stone
that it was of gold; he said of a man that it was a woman or of a woman
that it was a man. Or if he swore of a thing that was impossible: "If I
have not seen a camel flying in the air," or "If I have not seen a
serpent as thick as a beam of the olive-press." If a man said to
witnesses: "Come and testify for me" and they replied: "We swear that we
will not testify for you." If he swore that he would nullify a precept,
if he said I shall not erect a hut on the Feast of Tabernacles, or I
shall not take a *Lulab* on the Feast of Tabernacles, or I shall not put
on phylacteries. These constitute a "vain oath", for which he is liable
to lashes, if he uttered them deliberately, but if he uttered them
unwittingly he is not guilty.

If a man swore: "I shall eat this loaf of bread," then he swore: "I
shall not eat this loaf of bread." The first is "a rash oath", the
second is "a vain oath". If he ate it, he transgressed a "vain oath", if
he did not eat it he transgressed a "rash oath".

(*Mishna*)

 

ULLA said: This applies to something that is known to at least three
persons. If one swore of a thing which

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

is impossible: "If I have not seen a camel flying in the air." What is
meant by: "If I have not seen"? Abaya says: Read: "I swear that I have
seen." Raba said: It means a man said, "All the fruits in the world
should be forbidden to me if I have not seen a camel flying in the air."
Said Rabbina to Rab Ashi: It may be that the man saw a large bird, and
he called it a camel, and when he swore, he swore according to what was
in his mind. But if we say, we go according to what he utters with his
mouth and not according to what is in his mind. It is not so. For we
were taught: When a man was adjured, they said to him: "Know that we
adjure you not according to what is in your mind, but what is in our
mind and in the mind of the Court." Why is this? Because it may be said,
that a man gave to his debtor chips and counted them as *zuzim*, and
when he swore, he swore according to what was in his mind.—Not so, for
this is the case of Raba and the cane. (A man was sued for a sum of
money which was loaned to him. He was brought before Raba. Just as he
was to go on the witness stand he handed his cane to the plaintiff and
asked him to hold it for him. Whereupon he swore that he returned the
money. The plaintiff got so angry that he broke the cane in his
excitement; behold! money fell out of the cane. It was then established
that one swears not to what is in his mind, but what is in the mind of
the court.)

(*Gemara*)

 

THE laws regarding a "rash oath" apply to men and to women, to relatives
and to those who are not relatives, to those who are qualified to be
witnesses, and to those who are not. It matters not whether the oath was
made

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

before a court or not, as long as it was uttered from the person's own
mouth. And if it was uttered deliberately, he is liable to lashes, but
if unwittingly he brings a "Rising and Falling Offering".

The laws of "a vain oath" apply to men and to women, to relatives and to
non-relatives. To those who are qualified to be witnesses and to those
who are not. It matters not whether the oath was uttered before a court
or not, as long as it was uttered by one's own mouth. If it was uttered
deliberately he is liable to lashes, but if unwittingly, he is exempt.
For either of these oaths, if he was adjured by others, he is liable.
Thus if he said, I have not eaten today, and I have not put on
phylacteries today, and one said to him: "I adjure you", and he said,
"Amen", he is guilty.

(*Mishna*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER III</span>

 

AN OATH concerning testimony applies to men, but not to women. It
applies to strangers but not to relatives, to those that are fit to bear
witness, but not to those who are unfit, to those who are qualified and
to those who are not qualified. It matters not whether the oath was
uttered before a court or not, but it must be uttered from a man's own
mouth; if he was adjured by the mouth of others, he is not guilty,
unless he denies it before the court. This is according to Rabbi Meir.
But the Sages say: Whether he uttered it from his own mouth, or he was
adjured by the mouth of others, he is not liable unless he denies it
before the court.

One is guilty if he swore deliberately, or if he swore unwittingly, but
deliberately denied the knowledge of testimony. But he is not guilty if
he denied it in error.

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And what is one
liable for a deliberate oath? He is liable to a Rising and Falling
Offering.

What is an oath of testimony? If a man called two persons and said to
them: "Come and bear witness for me" and they swore that they knew of no
testimony for him, or if they said that they knew of no testimony for
him, and he said: "I adjure you", and they said "Amen", then they are
guilty. If he adjured them outside the courtroom five times, but when
they came before the court they admitted the knowledge of testimony,
they are exempt. But if they denied it, they are guilty for each oath.
If he adjured them before the court five times, and they denied, they
are guilty only once.

(*Mishna*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER IV</span>

 

WHAT is an oath of deposit? If a man said: "Give me my deposit that I
have with you" and the man swore: "You have nothing with me", or if he
said: "I have nothing that belongs to you", and the other said: "I
adjure you", and he answered: "Amen", he is guilty. If he adjured him
five times, before a court or not before a court, and he denied it, he
is guilty on each count. Rabbi Simon said: What is the reason? Because
he can retract and admit each time.

If one said: You have violated, or you have seduced my daughter, and the
other said: "I have not violated", or "I have not seduced your
daughter", and he said "I adjure you"—and he answered "Amen" he is
guilty. Rabbi Simon exempts him. For a man does not pay a fine through
his own admission. But though he pays no fine on his own admission, he
still pays for the blemish,

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

or for the indignity that he caused through his own admission.

If a man said: "You have stolen my ox" and the other answered: "I have
not" and he said: "I adjure you" and he replied "Amen", he is guilty. If
he said: "I stole it, but I have not killed it, nor have I sold it", and
the other said: "I adjure you", and he replied "Amen" he is exempt.

There was a rule established. Whoever must pay a fine through his own
admission is liable; but if he does not have to pay a fine, he is
exempt.

 

"YOU have violated, etc." . . . What is Rabbi Simon's reason? Because
the claimant is mainly seeking the fine. Raba said: According to Rabbi
Simon this could be compared to the case of a man who says to his
neighbor: "Give me the wheat, the barley, and the spelt that I have with
you", and the other says: "I swear that you have no wheat with me", and
it is proven that he had no wheat with the man, but barley and spelt he
did have; he is exempt, for he swore that he had no wheat and that was
true. Said Abaya: Can this be compared? Here he denies the possession of
wheat, but does not deny the possession of barley and spelt, while there
he denied the whole thing. But this then is to be compared to one who
says to his neighbor: "Give me the wheat, the barley, and the spelt that
I have with you." And the other answers: "I swear that you have nothing
with me", and it is proven that he has barley and spelt, but he had no
wheat; he is liable. When Rabbin came he said in the name of Rabbi
Yohanan: According to Rabbi Simon, he is asking only for the fine, but
not for

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

the shame and blemish that he caused. But according to the Sages, he is
claiming both the fine and also quittance for the shame and the
blemish.—Where is the disagreement?—Rab Papa said: Rabbi Simon is of the
opinion, that a man does not leave that which is fixed for something
which is not fixed, while the Rabbis are of the opinion that a man does
not leave that for which if one were to admit it, he would not be
exempt, for that for which if he were to admit it, he would be exempt.

(*Gemara*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER V</span>

 

ALL those who are made to take an oath as prescribed in the Torah, swear
and need not pay. The following take an oath and collect that which they
claim: The hired man, one who has been robbed, one who has been wounded,
and the one whose defendant cannot be trusted to take an oath, and the
storekeeper on his account book. For instance if a hired man said: "Give
me my wages that are due me", and the man answered him: "I have given
you your wages", and the hired man says: "I have not received any." He
takes an oath and obtains his wages. Rabbi Yehuda says: Not unless the
claim was admitted in part. How?—If for instance he said to him: "Give
me my wages of fifty *denars* that are due me", and he answered: "You
have already received one golden *denar*." How about a man that was
robbed? If it was testified that a man entered the house without
permission, to take a pledge, and the owner says: "You have taken my
vessel", and the other answers: "I have not taken", the owner takes an
oath and receives his vessel. Rabbi Yehuda says: Not unless there was
partial

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

admittance. If he said: "You have taken two vessels," and the other
replied: "I have taken one." . . .

How about the storekeeper on his books? Not if he says: "There is an
entry on my books that you owe me two hundred *zuz*." But if he said,
for instance: "Give to my son two *selahs’* worth of wheat", or "give to
my labourers a *selah's* worth of change", and he says I have given it
to them, while they say that they have not received it. The storekeeper
takes an oath and obtains his due, and they take an oath and receive
their due. Ben Nanas said: How is that? They both are made to take a
"vain oath". No, he gets his without an oath, and they get theirs
without an oath.

If a man said to the storekeeper: "Give me a *denar's* worth of fruit",
and he gave it to him and then said: "Give me the *denar*", and he
replied: "I have given it to you and you put it into your till." The
householder takes an oath that he gave the *denar* to the storekeeper.
If the householder says "Give me the fruit," and the storekeeper says:
"I have given them to you and you took them home", then the storekeeper
takes the oath. Rabbi Yehuda says: He that is in possession of the
fruit, has the upper hand.

If a man said to a money changer: "Give me a *denar's* worth of change"
and he gave it to him and then the money-changer says: "Give me the
*denar*", and he replies: "I have given it to you and you put it into
your till", then the householder takes an oath. If the householder gave
him a *denar*, then asks him for the change and the money-changer says:
"I have given it to you, and you put them into your purse." Then the
money-changer

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

takes an oath that he gave him the change. Rabbi Yehuda says: It is not
the way of a moneychanger to give even an issar without first receiving
the *denar*.

(*Mishna*)

 

"ALL THOSE who are made to take an oath, etc." Where do we deduce
this?—For the *Scripture* said: (*Exodus* xxii, 11) *And the owner of it
shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good*. He that has to
make the payment, he is the one to take the oath.

"The following take an oath and collect." Why is a hired-man different,
that the Rabbis have decreed that he should take the oath and obtain his
payment? Said Rab Yehuda in the name of Samuel: Here they taught a great
law. Are these then laws? Say then, that these are great rulings—Great,
because there are also minor rulings? But Rab Nahman said in the name of
Samuel: They enacted here iron-clad laws. The Rabbis here took the oath
away from the householder and imposed it upon the hired man for the sake
of his livelihood.—Shall we then injure the householder for the sake of
the livelihood of the hired man?—the householder himself would prefer
that the hired man take the oath and get his wages, so that the men will
hire themselves out to him.—Just the opposite. Would not the hired man
prefer that the householder take the oath and be freed from paying him,
so that the householder be compelled to hire him?—The householder has to
employ hired men. The hired man needs employment.—Furthermore the
householder is occupied with his many hired men.—Then why should he not
pay him without an oath?—Just to appease the house-holder—

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Then why should he
not pay him before witnesses?—That would be inconvenient for him—Then
why should he not pay him at the beginning?—Well, both need credit. This
should also apply in the case of arranging the amount of the wages
stipulated. Therefore we have learned: If the labourer says: You
stipulated two *zuz;* while the householder says: "I stipulated only
one", the burden of proof falls upon the one who demands the payment.
The labourer surely remembers the amount stipulated.—If so, this should
also apply in case the time of payment has expired. Why was it taught:
If the time had expired, and he did not pay him, he does not take an
oath to receive his wages?—It is assumed that the householder will not
transgress the precept: (*Lev*. xix, 13) . . . *shall not abide with
thee all night until the morning*.—But didn't you say that the
householder is preoccupied with his hired men?—This only before the time
of payment has arrived. But when the time of payment has arrived? The
obligation lies heavy upon him and he is aware of his duty.—Will the
labourer then transgress the precept: (*Lev*. xix, 13) *Thou shalt not
rob?*—As for the householder there are two assumptions: First the
householder will not transgress the precept regarding the *wages of a
hired servant*, and second, the hired man will not allow the payment of
his wages to be delayed.

(*Gemara*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER VII</span>

 

THERE are four kinds of guardian: an unpaid guardian, a borrower, a paid
guardian, and a hirer. The unpaid guardian takes an oath in every
instance, and is exempt; a borrower must pay in every instance; a paid

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

guardian or a hirer takes an oath in case the beast was injured, was
captured, or died, and he is exempt; but he must pay if it were lost or
stolen.
