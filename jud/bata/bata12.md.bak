### Divorces

### (<span class="smallcaps">Tractate Gittin</span>)

ALL documents that have a Cuthean as a witness are invalid, except writs
of divorce and bills of emancipation. There was a case of a writ of
divorce that was brought before Rabban Gamaliel at Kfar Othnai. The
witnesses were Cutheans. He declared it valid. All documents that are
executed in the courts of the foreigners, though the witnesses be
foreigners, are valid, except the writs of divorce and bills of slave
emancipation. Rabbi Simon says: These, too, are valid. They are not to
be honored only if they were executed by unauthorized persons.

(*Mishna*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER I</span>

 

IF A man sent a writ of divorce to his wife and then overtook the
messenger or sent another messenger to him and declared: The writ I gave
to thee is void; it becomes void.

Witnesses sign a document as a precaution, for the general good.

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

If a man had pledged his slave as security and then set him free, the
law declared that the slave is not liable for anything, but as a
precaution the new master is compelled to give him a bill of
emancipation, and the slave executes a bill of indebtedness for his
value. Rabban Gamaliel says: He executes no document whatsoever. The one
that set him free is liable. If a man is half slave and half free, he
works one day for his master and one day for himself. This is according
to the House of Hillel, but the House of Shamai said to them: This is
well for the master, but not so for the man. He may not marry a slave,
since he is half free, and he can not marry a free woman because he is
half slave. Shall he remain unmarried forever? Was not the world made
for fruition and increase? As was said: (*Isaiah* xlv, 18) *He created
it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited*. For the general good, the
master is compelled to set the half slave free, and the man gives him a
pledge for a half of his value. The House of Hillel changed their view
and taught according to the decision of the House of Shamai.

If a man sold his slave to a foreigner or beyond the borders of the Land
of Israel, the slave must be set free.

Captives should not be ransomed for more than their worth, to prevent
abuses. For the same reason captives are not aided in their escape.
Rabban Simon ben Gamaliel said: This is a precaution for the good of the
captives. One does not buy scrolls of the *Torah*, phylacteries or
*mezuzoth* for more than their value, to prevent abuses.

If a man sent away his wife because of her bad reputation, he may not
take her back.

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

If a man sent away his wife because she is barren, Rabbi Yehuda says: He
may not take her back. But the sages said: He may take her back.

(*Mishna*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER IV</span>

MANY procedures were laid down as a precaution for the general good. A
priest is called to read the *Torah* first, then a Levite and then an
Israelite, for the sake of peace. A pit nearest the water-channel is
filled in first, for the sake of peace. The taking of animals from their
traps and fish from their nets is considered somewhat like theft, for
the sake of peace. Rabbi Yosi says: This is outright theft.

The things found by a deaf-mute or an imbecile, or a minor, are looked
upon as belonging to them; and taking them away is somewhat like
theft—for the sake of peace. Rabbi Yosi says: This is outright theft. If
a poor man shakes the top of an olive tree, what is found beneath it is
considered like theft, for the sake of peace. Rabbi Yosi says: Outright
theft. One does not prevent the poor of the foreigner from gathering
gleanings, the forgotten sheaf, and grain from the corner of fields, for
the sake of peace. A woman may lend to her neighbor a sieve, a handmill,
or an oven, though the neighbor is suspected of transgressing the
Sabbatical year, for the sake of peace.

One may lend a hand in the field to a foreigner in the Sabbatical year,
but not to an Israelite.

One extends greetings to a foreigner, all for the sake of peace.

(*Mishna*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER V</span>

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

THREE kinds of writ of divorce are not valid, but, if the woman
remarried, the children are legitimate. If a man wrote the writ in his
own hand, but there are no witnesses to it; there is no date on it, but
there are witnesses; there is a date, but only one witness. Those are
the three kinds of writ of divorce that are not valid, but, if the woman
remarried, the children are legitimate. Rabbi Eliezer says: Though there
are no signatures of witnesses on the writ, but it was given to the
woman before two witnesses; it is valid, and she may collect her
marriage allotment from mortgaged property, because the witnesses sign
only as a precaution.

The House of Shamai says: A man must not divorce his wife unless he has
found her unfaithful. As was said: (*Deuteronomy* xxiv, 1) *Because he
hath found some uncleanness in her*. The House of Hillel says: He may
divorce her if she only spoiled a dish for him because it was said:
Uncleanness in anything. Rabbi Akiba says: He may divorce her if he
found another that is more beautiful than his wife, because it was said:
(*Deut*. xxiv, 1) *If it come to pass that she find no favour in his
eyes*.

(*Mishna*)

 

WHEN Rab Papa was confronted with a Persian document that was made in a
foreign court, he would call in two foreigners, and without one knowing
of the other, let them read the document. If they both agreed as to its
contents, he would honor the document and, even, collect money on
mortgaged property by such a document.

Rab Yehuda would take pains to read every document submitted to him. But
Ula once said to him: You need not go to this trouble, for Rabbi
Eliezer, who was

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

the Head of the Land of Israel, had the documents read to him, and then
he signed them. Rabbi Nachman would let the court scribes read the
document to him, and then he would sign.

Rabbi Shaman ben Aba said in the name of Rabbi Yohanan: If a slave
escapes from prison, he becomes free, and furthermore his master is
compelled to give him a bill of emancipation. But Rab Simon ben Gamaliel
taught that he returns to slavery. Rabbi bar Hanah said in the name of
Rabbi Yohanan that whenever Rab Simon ben Gamaliel makes a statement in
the Mishna, the law is followed according to his decision. There is the
story of a woman slave of Mar Samuel that was captured. She was ransomed
and was returned to the Rabbi with a message: We are of the opinion of
Rabbi Simon ben Gamaliel, but even if you follow the decision of the
Rabbis you may take her back, because we ransomed her as a slave. But as
he had given up all hope of ever recovering her, he would not take her
back as a slave, and she was not even required to get a bill of
emancipation.

Rabbi Zera said in the name of Rabbi Hanina, who quoted Rabbi Ashi: The
Rabbi said: When a slave marries a free woman in the presence of his
master, he becomes free. Rabbi Yohana asked him: Do you know that to be
the ruling? I learned that according to Rabbi Meir, if a man write a
contract of betrothal for his female slave, she becomes betrothed, and
the Sages said that she is not betrothed. The explanation is like the
one of Rabbi ben Shila who ruled in an analogous case: When the master
puts the phylacteries on him. So is the

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

ruling, here. The slave becomes free, as the master himself gives him
the wife.

Rabbi Joshua ben Levi said: When a slave puts on phylacteries in the
presence of his master, he is free. If the master borrows money from his
slave, or appoints him overseer of his estate, or if the slave puts on
phylacteries or reads three passages from the *Torah*, in the house of
worship, in the presence of his master, does he become free thereby? No,
answered Rabbi ben Shila: only when the master, himself, puts the
phylacteries on the slave.

When Rabbi Dime came he quoted Rabbi Yohanan as saying: If a man said;
just before he died, My female slave so and so should be set free, his
heirs are bound to give her a bill of emancipation.

Rabbi Samuel ben Yehuda quoted Rabbi Yohanan: If a man said at his death
bed, my woman slave so and so has been very kind to me, I want some
kindness to be done for her, the heirs are bound to do a deed of
kindness for her. It is a duty to execute the will of the dead.

There was once a slave owned by two masters. One set him free as to his
half. The other bethought himself: If the Rabbis hear of it, they will
compel me to set him free. So he transferred him to his minor son. Rab
Joseph took this case to Rab Papa. He retorted: (*Obadiah* i, 15) *As
thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: Thy reward shall return upon
thine head*. We all are aware that a child likes to play with coins. We
shall appoint a guardian for the child. He will jingle some coins before
him, and then the guardian will write a bill of emancipation in the
child's name.
