### Childless Widows

### (<span class="smallcaps">Tractate Yebamoth</span>)

*IF BRETHREN dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the
wife of the dead shall not marry without, unto a stranger: her husband's
brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife*
(*Deuteronomy* xxv, 5) .

*And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his
brother's wife go up to the gate unto the Elders, and say: My husband's
brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel; he will
not perform the duty of my husband's brother*.

*Then the Elders of his city call him, and speak unto him; and if he
stand to it, and say: I like not to take her. Then shall his brother's
wife come unto him in the presence of the Elders and* (*perform the
Halizah*) *loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and
shall answer and say: So shall it be done unto that man that will not
build up his brother's house* (*Deuteronomy* xxv, 7-8-9). \[These words
from the *Bible* make clear the basis of this tractate.\]

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

A WOMAN whose husband went to a land beyond the sea, was advised that he
had died. She remarried and subsequently her husband returned. She must
leave one and the other, and must get a divorce from each one of them.
She has no claim on either of them for her marriage settlement, her
board, nor her clothes, and if she has taken anything from one and the
other, she must return it to them. If a child was born to her by either
of them, the child is a bastard. Neither of them will be defiled because
of her, and neither one nor the other has any claim on whatever she
finds, nor on her handiwork, nor can either of them set aside her vows.
If she be the daughter of an Israelite, she is barred from marriage to a
priest; if she be a daughter of a Levite, from eating of the tithe; and
if a daughter of a priest, from eating of the Heave-offering. The heirs
of neither of them may inherit her marriage settlement. If either of the
husbands die, their brothers must perform the *Halizah*, but may not
contract levirate marriage.

Rabbi Yosi says: Her dowry is a charge on her first husband's estate.

Rabbi Eleazar says: Her first husband has a right to whatever she may
find, or to her handiwork, and may void her vows.

Rabbi Simon says: If the brother of her first husband cohabited with
her, or performed the *Halizah*, her co-wife is exempt from levirate
marriage, and a child begotten by her first husband is not a bastard.
But if she were married again without the consent of court, she may
return to her first husband. If she married

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

again with the consent of the court, she must be divorced and she must
make the sin offering. It is the authority of the court that makes her
exempt from the sin offering. If the court permitted her to remarry but
she went out and disgraced herself, she must bring a sin offering;
because the court's permission was only to marry.

(*Mishna*)

 

"AND must get a divorce from each one of them." It is quite obvious that
she must get a divorce from the first husband. But why from the second,
which is nothing else but a case of adultery?

Rabbi Huna answers: This is a precaution. It may be said that the first
husband had divorced her, and the second had lawfully married her, and a
married woman may leave her husband without a writ of divorce. If so,
how is the latter clause to be explained, which says: If she was told:
Thine spouse is dead, and she was betrothed, and her husband returned,
she may return to him. One may say this time too that her first husband
divorced her, and that the second married her, and that consequently a
married woman may leave her husband without a writ of divorce. In
reality she does not need a divorce. If so it may appear that the first
husband had married his divorced wife after she was betrothed. This is
in accordance with Rabbi Yosi ben Kipper who maintained that the
remarrying of one's divorced wife after a marriage is forbidden, but
after a betrothal is permissible.

"She has no claim on her marriage settlement." Why did the Rabbis
provide a marriage settlement? The

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rabbis provided a
marriage settlement so that it wouldn't be easy for a man to divorce his
wife. But in this case let it be easy for him to divorce his wife.

(*Gemara*)  
<span class="small">FROM CHAPTER X</span>

 

THE ceremony of the *Halizah* must be performed before three judges,
even if they be laymen. If the widow performed it with a shoe, it is
valid; if with a sock, it is not valid; if with a heeled sandal, it is
valid; but if it had no heel, it is not valid; if from below the knee,
it is valid; if from above the knee, it is not valid. If she performed
the Halizah with a shoe that did not belong to the man, or with a sabot,
or with a left shoe that was worn on the right foot, it is valid. With a
shoe that was too big, but he could walk in it, or with one that was too
small but covered most of his foot, it is valid.

(*Mishna*)

 

SAID Raba, in the name of Rabbi Cabana, in the name of Rab: If the.
prophet Elijah should appear and say that *Halizah* may be performed
with a shoe, he would be followed, but if he would say *Halizah* must
not be performed with a sandal, he would not be followed, because it has
long since been established by the people that *Halizah* is being
performed with a sandal.

"Above the knee." Rabbi Cahana objects (*Deuteronomy* xxviii, 57) *And
toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet*. Abaya
answered: When a woman kneels to give birth she presses her heels
against her thighs and thus gives birth. Come and hear: (2 *Samuel* xix,
24) *And had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard*. This is a
euphemistic phrase. Come

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

and hear: (1 *Samuel* xxiv, 3) *And Saul went in to cover his feet*.
This, too, is a euphemistic phrase. Come and hear: (*Judges* iii, 24)
*Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber*. This is a
euphemistic phrase: (*Judges* v, 27) *At her feet*, etc. This, too, is a
euphemistic phrase.

Rabbi Yohanan said: Seven indulgencies in sexual intercourse had that
wicked man, Sisera, the day he fled from Barak and Deborah. For it was
said: (*Judges* v, 27) *At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at
her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead*.
But surely Jael had pleasure from that sin.

Rabbi Yohanan answered in the name of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai: Every good
deed committed by an evil person is evil unto the righteous. As it is
said: (*Genesis* xxxi, 24) *Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob
either good or bad*. Obviously, when it is spoken of evil; but why of
good deeds? Because the good deeds of the wicked are evil to the
righteous. By all means, because he may mention to him the name of his
idol. But what evil could it cause here? He may inoculate her with
sensual lust. As Rabbi Yohanan said: When the serpent copulated with
Eve, he inoculated her with lust. For the Israelites who stood at Mount
Sinai, lust terminated, but the lust of those who did not stand at Mount
Sinai was not terminated.
