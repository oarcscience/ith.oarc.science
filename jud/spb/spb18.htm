<p>There is none like unto thee among the gods, O Lord; and there are no works like unto thine. Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations. The Lord reigneth; the Lord hath reigned; the Lord shall reign for ever and ever. The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.</p>  
<p>Father of mercies, do good in thy favor unto Zion; build thou the walls of Jerusalem. For in thee alone do we trust, O King, high and exalted God, Lord of worlds.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>The Ark is Opened</i>.</p>  
<p><i>Reader and Cong</i>.&#8212;And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, O Lord, and thine enemies shall be scattered, and they that hate thee shall flee before thee. For out of Zion shall go forth the Law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</p>

<p align="center"><i>The Reader takes the Scroll of the Law and Says:&#8212;</i></p>  
<p>Blessed be he who in his holiness gave the Law to his people Israel.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>In some Congregations the following is said:&#8212;</i></p>  
<p align="center"><small>Zohar, Parshath Vayakhel.</small></p>  
<p>Blessed be the name of the Sovereign of the universe. Blessed be thy crown and thy abiding-place. Let thy favor rest with thy people Israel for ever: show them the redemption of thy right hand in thy holy temple. Vouchsafe unto us the benign gift of thy light, and in mercy accept our supplications. May it be thy will to prolong our life in well-being. Let me also be numbered among the righteous, so that thou mayest be merciful unto me, and have me in thy keeping, with all that belong to me and to thy people Israel. Thou art he that feedeth and sustaineth all; thou art he that ruleth over all; thou art he that ruleth over kings, for dominion is thine. I am the servant of the Holy One, blessed be he, before whom and before whose glorious Law I prostrate myself at all times: not in man do I put my trust, nor upon any angel do I rely, but upon the God of heaven, who is the God of truth, and whose Law is truth, and whose prophets are prophets of truth, and who aboundeth in deeds of goodness and truth. In him I put my trust, and unto his holy and glorious name I utter praises. May it be thy will to open my heart unto thy Law, and to fulfil the wishes of my heart and of the hearts of all thy people Israel for good, for life, and for peace.</p>

<p align="center"><i>On Festivals the following is said:&#8212;</i></p>  
<p>The Lord, the Lord is a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness and truth; keeping lovingkindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin. (<i>To be said three times</i>.)</p>  
<p>Lord of the universe, fulfil the wishes of my heart for good; grant my desire, give me my request, even unto me, thy servant, &#8212; the son of &#8212; (thy maid servant &#8212; the daughter of &#8212;), and make me worthy (together with my wife,) (my husband,) (my children,) to do thy will with a perfect heart; and deliver me from the evil inclination. O grant our portion in thy Law; make us worthy to have thy divine presence abiding with us; vouchsafe unto us the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and fear of the Lord. So also may it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that I may be fitted to do such deeds as are good in thy sight, and to walk in the way of the upright before thee. Sanctify us by thy commandments, that we may merit the long and blessed life of the world to come: guard us from evil deeds, and also from evil hours that visit and afflict this world. As for him who trusteth in the Lord, let lovingkindness surround him Amen.</p>  
<p>Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.</p>  
<p>And as for me, may my prayer unto thee, O Lord, be in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, answer me in the truth of thy salvation.</p>

It is a tree of life to them that grasp it, and of them that uphold it every one is rendered happy. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Length of days is in its right hand; in its left hand are riches and honor. It pleased the Lord, for his righteousness&#8217; sake, to magnify the Law and to make it honorable.</p>

And by the hands of thy servants, the prophets, it is written saying, I will cleanse their blood that I have not yet cleansed: for the Lord dwelleth in Zion. And in the Holy Writings it is said, Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God? Let there be made known among the nations in our sight the revenging of the blood of thy servants which hath been shed. And it is said, For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them; he forgetteth not the cry of the humble. And it is further said, He judgeth among the nations; the land is full of corpses: he smiteth the head over a wide land.

Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? And who may stand in his holy place? He that hath clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not set his desire upon vanity, and hath not sworn deceitfully. He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is the generation of them that seek after him, that seek thy face (O God of) Jacob! (Selah.) Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who, then, is the King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.

<p align="center"><i>While the Scroll of the Law is being placed in the Ark, the following to "as of old" is said:&#8212;</i></p>  
<p>And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel. Arise, O Lord, unto thy resting place; thou, and the ark of thy strength. Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy loving ones shout for joy. For the sake of David thy servant, turn not away the face of thine anointed. For I give you good doctrine; forsake ye not my Law. It is a tree of life to them that grasp it, and of them that uphold it every one is rendered happy. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall return: renew our days as of old.</p>
