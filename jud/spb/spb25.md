### MEDITATION AND BLESSINGS ON TAKING THE LULAB.

*On Tabernacles, previous to Hallel, [p. 313](spb26.htm#page_313.md), being
said, the Lulab is taken, and the following Meditation and Blessings are
read:—*

Lo, I am prepared and ready to fulfil the command of my Creator, who
hath commanded us in his Law, And ye shall take you on the first day the
fruit of the tree Hadar, branches of palm trees, a bough of the tree
Aboth, and willows of the brook. While I wave them, may the stream of
blessings flow in upon me, together with holy thoughts which tell that
he is the God of gods and Lord of lords, governing below and above,
whose kingdom ruleth over all. May this my observance of the precept of
the Four Species be accounted as though I had fulfilled it in all its
details and particulars. And let the pleasantness of the Lord our God be
upon us, and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work
of our hands establish thou it. Blessed be the Lord for ever, Amen, and
Amen.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast given us command concerning
the taking of the Lulab.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast kept us
in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season.

*The latter Blessing is said on the First Day of the Festival only.
Should the First Day, however, fall on Sabbath, it is said on the Second
Day*.
