### THIRTEEN PRINCIPLES OF THE FAITH. <span id="fr_9"></span>[\*](#fn_7.md)

1\. I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be his name,
is the Author and Guide of everything that has been created, and that he
alone has made, does make, and will make all things.

2\. I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be his name,
is a Unity, and that there is no unity in any manner like unto his, and
that he alone is our God, who was, is, and will be.

3\. I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be his name,
is not a body, and that he is free from all the accidents of matter, and
that he has not any form whatsoever.

4\. I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be his name,
is the first and the last.

5\. I believe with perfect faith that to the Creator, blessed be his
name, and to him alone, it is right to pray, and that it is not right to
pray to any being besides him.

6\. I believe with perfect faith that all the words of the prophets are
true.

7\. I believe with perfect faith that the prophecy of Moses our teacher,
peace be unto him, was true, and that he was the chief of the prophets,
both of those that preceded and of those that followed him.

8\. I believe with perfect faith that the whole Law, now in our
possession, is the same that was given to Moses our teacher, peace be
unto him.

9\. I believe with perfect faith that this Law will not be changed, and
that there will never be any other law from the Creator, blessed be his
name.

10\. I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be his name,
knows every deed of the children of men, and all their thoughts, as it
is said, It is he that fashioneth the hearts of them all, that giveth
heed to all their deeds.

11\. I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be his name,
rewards those that keep his commandments, and punishes those that
transgress them.

12\. I believe with perfect faith in the coming of the Messiah, and,
though he tarry, I will wait daily for his coming.

13\. I believe with perfect faith that there will be a resurrection of
the dead at the time when it shall please the Creator, blessed be his
name, and exalted be the remembrance of him for ever and ever.

For thy salvation I hope, O Lord! I hope, O Lord, for thy salvation! O
Lord, for thy salvation I hope!
