### SERVICE FOR PURIM

*Before reading the Book of Esther the following Blessings are said:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast given us command concerning
the reading of the Megillah.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who wroughtest
miracles for our fathers in days of old, at this season.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast kept us
in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season.

*After reading the Book of Esther say:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who dost plead
our cause, judge our suit and avenge our wrong, who renderest
retribution to all that hate our soul, and on our behalf dealest out
punishment to our adversaries. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who on behalf
of thy people Israel dealest out punishment to all their adversaries, O
God, the Savior.

*The following paragraph is omitted after the Reading of the Book of
Esther in the morning:—*

—Who broughtest the counsel of the heathen to nought, and madest the
devices of the crafty of none effect, when a wicked man, an arrogant
offshoot of the seed of Amalek, rose up against us. Insolent in his
riches, he digged himself a pit, and his own greatness laid him a snare.
In his mind he thought to entrap, but was himself entrapped, he sought
to destroy, but was speedily destroyed. Haman displayed the hatred of
his fathers, and stirred up against the children the ancient enmity of
the brothers (Esau and Jacob), remembering not the mercy of Saul,
through whose compassion for Agag the enemy was born. The wicked plotted
to cut off the just, and the unclean was caught in the hands of the
pure. (Mordecai's)

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

lovingkindness (to Esther) prevailed over the father's (Saul's) error,
but the wicked (Haman) heaped sin upon the sins of his ancestor. In his
heart he hid his cunning devices, and sold himself to do wickedness. He
stretched forth his hand against God's saints; he gave his silver to cut
off the remembrance of them. When Mordecai saw that wrath had gone
forth, and that the decrees of Haman were issued in Shushan, lie put on
sackcloth and wrapped himself in mourning, ordained a fast and sat upon
ashes. Who will rise up to atone for error, and obtain pardon for the
sin rind iniquity of our fathers? A flower blossomed from the palm tree:
lo! Hadassah arose to awaken the merit of those that slept in the grave.
Her servants hastened to make Haman drink the wine of the poison of
snakes. He rose by his riches, but fell in his wickedness; he made him a
gallows, and was himself hanged thereon. All the inhabitants of the
world opened their mouths, for the lot of Haman was turned to be our
lot. When the righteous was delivered out of the hand of the wicked, and
the enemy was put in his stead, the Jews ordained for themselves to
celebrate Purim, and to rejoice thereon every year. Thou didst regard
the prayer of Mordecai and Esther: Haman and his sons thou didst hang
upon the gallows.

The lily of Jacob rejoiced and was glad when Mordecai was seen in the
purple. Thou hast ever been Israel's salvation, and their hope in every
generation, to make known that all who hope in thee shall not be
ashamed, neither shall any be confounded who put their trust in thee.
Accursed be Haman who sought to destroy me; blessed be Mordecai the Jew;
accursed be Zeresh, the wife of him that terrified me; blessed be Esther
my protectress, and may Harbonah also be remembered for good.
