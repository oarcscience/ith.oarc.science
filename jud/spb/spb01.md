Intangible Textual Heritage

### PUBLISHERS’ FOREWORD.

<span class="smallcaps">The Standard Prayer Book</span> is an American
reprint of *The Authorized Daily Prayer Book*, which is in general use
today throughout the British Empire. It was originally published under
the authorization of the late Chief Rabbi, Dr. Nathan Marcus Adler. The
English translation, by the Rev. Simeon Singer, is universally
acknowledged to be the best ever published. This American edition is set
from new and larger type and is characterized by the continuity of the
text, which has necessitated the addition of nearly 300 pages, making it
the most complete daily prayer-book ever published.
