*Psalm for the First Day of the Week*.

*This is the First Day of the Week on which the Levites in the Temple
used to say:—*

Psalm xxiv.

A Psalm of David: The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the
world, and they that dwell therein. For it is he that hath founded it
upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Who may ascend the
mountain of the Lord? And who may stand in his holy place? He that hath
clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not set his desire upon vanity,
and hath not sworn deceitfully. He shall receive a blessing from the
Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is the
generation of them that seek after him, that seek thy face, (O God of)
Jacob! (Selah.) Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye
everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who, then, is the
King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors,
that the King of glory may come in. Who, then, is the King of glory? The
Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. (Selah.)

*Psalm for the Second Day of the Week*.

<span class="small">This is the Second Day of the Week on which the
Levites in the Temple used to say:—</span>

(Psalm xlviii.)

A Song; a Psalm of the Sons of Korah. Great is the Lord, and highly to
be praised, in the city of our God, in his holy mountain. Beautiful in
elevation, the joy of the whole earth is mount Zion,—at the sides of the
north,—the city of the great king. God hath made himself known in her
palaces as a stronghold. For, lo, the kings met each other, they passed
on together. They saw it; then were they amazed; they were confounded,
they hasted away. Trembling took hold of them there; pangs

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

as of a woman in travail. With an east wind thou didst break the ships
of Tarshish. As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord
of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.
(Selah.) We thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy
temple. As is thy name, O God, so is thy renown unto the ends of the
earth; thy right hand is full of righteousness. Let mount Zion rejoice,
let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. Compass ye
Zion and go round about her: count the towers thereof. Mark ye well her
rampart, traverse her palaces; that ye may tell a later generation, that
this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto
death.

*Psalm for the Third Day of the Week*.

<span class="small">This is the Third Day of the Week, on which the
Levites in the Temple used to say:—</span>

(Psalm lxxxii.)

A Psalm of Asaph. God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he
judgeth among the judges. How long will ye judge unjustly, and respect
the persons of the wicked? (Selah.) Judge the lowly and fatherless: do
justice to the afflicted and destitute. Rescue the lowly and needy:
deliver them out of the hand of the wicked. They know not, neither do
they understand; they walk about in darkness: all the foundations of the
earth are moved. I said, Ye are gods, and all of you sons

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

of the Most High. Nevertheless ye shall die like men, and fall like one
of the princes. Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt possess
all the nations.

*Psalm for the Fourth Day of the Week*.

<span class="small">This is the Fourth Day of the Week, on which the
Levites in the Temple used to say:—</span>

(Psalm xciv.)

O God of vengeance, Lord, O God of vengeance, shine forth. Lift up
thyself, thou judge of the earth: render to the proud their desert.
Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph? They
prate, they speak arrogantly: all the workers of iniquity are boastful.
They crush thy people, O Lord, and afflict thine heritage. They slay the
widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. And they say, The
Lord will not see, neither will the God of Jacob give heed. Give heed,
ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise? He that
planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not
see? He that chasteneth the nations, shall not he punish, even he that
teacheth man knowledge? The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, that they
are vanity. Happy is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest
out of thy Law; that thou mayest give him rest from the days of evil,
until the pit be digged for the wicked. For the Lord will not cast off
his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. For judgment shall
return unto righteousness: and all the. upright in heart shall follow
it. Who will rise up for me against

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

the evil-doers, who will stand up for me against the workers of
iniquity? Unless the Lord had been my help, my soul had soon dwelt in
silence. When I say, My foot slippeth, thy lovingkindness, O Lord,
holdeth me up. In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts
delight my soul. Hath the tribunal of destruction fellowship with thee,
which frameth mischief by statute? They gather themselves together
against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. But
the Lord is become my stronghold; and my God the rock of my refuge. And
he bringeth back upon them their own iniquity, and for their evil shall
cut them off; the Lord our God shall cut them off.

O come, let us exult before the Lord: let us shout for joy to the rock
of our salvation.

*Psalm for the Fifth Day of the Week*.

<span class="small">This is the Fifth Day of the Week, on which the
Levites in the Temple used to say:—</span>

(Psalm lxxxi.)

To the Chief Musician. Set to the Gittith. A Psalm of Asaph. Exult aloud
unto God our strength: shout for joy unto the God of Jacob. Raise the
song, and strike the timbrel, the pleasant lyre with the harp. Blow the
horn on the new moon, at the beginning of the month, for our day of
festival. For it is a statute of Israel, a decree of the God of Jacob.
He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when he went forth over the
land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I knew not. I removed his
shoulder from the burden: his hands were freed from the basket. Thou
calledst in

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

trouble and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of
thunder, I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. (Selah.) Hear, O my
people, and I will testify against thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken
unto me. There shall be no strange god in thee; neither shalt thou
worship any foreign god. I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of
the land of Egypt: open wide thy mouth, and I will fill it. But my
people hearkened not to my voice; and Israel was not willing towards me.
So I let them go in the stubbornness of their heart, that they might
walk in their own counsels. O that my people would hearken unto me, that
Israel would walk in my ways. I would soon subdue their enemies, and
turn my hand against their adversaries. The haters of the Lord should
submit themselves unto him; so that their time might endure for ever. He
would feed them also with the fat of wheat: and with honey out of the
rock would I satisfy thee.

*Psalm for the Sixth Day of the Week*.

<span class="small">This is the Sixth Day of the Week, on which the
Levites in the Temple used to say:—</span>

Psalm xciii.

The Lord reigneth; he hath robed him in majesty; the Lord hath robed
him, yea, he hath girded himself with strength: the world also is set
firm, that it cannot be moved. Thy throne is set firm from of old: thou
art from everlasting. The streams have lifted up, O Lord, the streams
have lifted up their voice; the streams lift up their roaring. Than the
voices of many waters, mighty waters, breakers of the sea, more mighty
is the Lord on high. Thy testimonies are very

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

faithful: holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, for evermore.

*On the days when Tachanun ([p. 76](spb05.htm#page_76.md) to [p.
80](spb05.htm#page_80).md) is said, the following is added after the Psalm
of the day:—*

Psalm lxxxiii.

A Song: A Psalm of Asaph. O God, keep not thou silence: hold not thy
peace, and be not still, O God. For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult:
and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They take crafty
counsel against thy people, and consult together against thy hidden
ones. They have said, Come and let us cut them off from being a nation;
that the name of Israel may be remembered no more. For they have
consulted together with one consent; against thee do they make a
covenant. The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab and the Hagarenes;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre:
Assyria also is joined with them; they have been an arm of help to the
children of Lot. (Selah.) Do thou unto them as unto Midian; as to
Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon. They were destroyed at Endor;
they became as dung for the earth. Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb;
yea, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna: who said, Let us take to
ourselves in possession the habitations of God. O my God, make them like
the whirling dust, as stubble before the wind; as the fire that burneth
the forest, and as the flame that setteth the mountains on fire: so
pursue them with thy storm, and confound them with thy hurricane. Fill
their faces with confusion; that they may seek thy name,

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> O Lord. Let them
be ashamed and confounded tor ever; yea, let them be abashed and perish.
That they may know that thou, of whom alone the name is the Lord, art
Most High over all the earth

*On New Moon, Psalm civ. is read, [p. 264](spb22.htm#page_264.md)*.

*From the beginning of the Month of Elul until Hoshana Rabba, the
following Psalm is read every Morning and Evening:—*

Psalm xxvii.

A Psalm of David. The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I
fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
When evil-doers drew nigh against me to eat up my flesh, even my
adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell. Though an host should
encamp against me, my heart would not fear; though war should rise
against me, even then would I be confident. One thing have I asked of
the Lord, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the
Lord all the days of my life, to behold the pleasantness of the Lord,
and to inquire in his temple. For in the day of trouble he will hide me
in his pavilion: in the shelter of his tabernacle will be conceal me; he
will lift me up upon a rock. And now shall mine head be lifted up above
mine enemies round about me; and I will offer in his tabernacle
sacrifices of joyful shouting; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises
unto the Lord. Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice; have pity upon
me, and answer me. My heart saith unto thee, (since thou hast said),
Seek ye my face, Thy face, Lord will I seek. Hide not thy face from me;
thrust not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; cast me
not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. For nay father and
my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord will take me up. Teach me thy
way, O Lord; and lead me on an even path, because of them that lie in
wait for me Give me not up to the will of mine

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

adversaries: for false witnesses have risen up against me, and such as
breathe out violence. (I should despair), unless I believed to see the
goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait for the Lord; be
strong and let thine heart take courage; yea, wait thou for the Lord.

*In some Congregations the following Psalm is said daily before "Blessed
be he," etc., [p. 19](spb05.htm#page_19.md)*.

Psalm xxx.

<span class="small">A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House; a
Psalm of David. I will extol thee, O Lord; for thou hast drawn me up,
and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. O Lord, my God, I cried
unto thee, and thou didst heal me. O Lord, thou broughtest up my soul
from the grave; thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to
the pit. Sing praise unto the Lord, O ye his loving ones, and give
thanks to his holy name. For his anger is but for a moment; his favor is
for a lifetime: weeping may tarry for the night, but joy cometh in the
morning. As for me, I said in my prosperity I shall never be moved.
Thou, Lord, of thy favor hadst made my mountain to stand strong; thou
didst hide thy face; I was confounded. I cried unto thee, O Lord; and
unto the Lord I made supplication: What profit is there in my blood if I
go down to the pit? Can the dust give thanks to thee? Can it declare thy
truth? Hear, O Lord, and be gracious unto me; Lord, be thou my helper.
Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing; thou hast loosed my
sackcloth, and girded me with gladness: to the end that my glory may
sing praise to thee, and not be silent: O Lord my God, I will give
thanks unto thee for ever.</span>
