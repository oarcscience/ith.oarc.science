### HALLEL.

*The following Prayer (Hallel) is said on New Moon, on Passover,
Pentecost and Tabernacles, and on Chanukah*.

*On the Intermediate Days of Festivals the Tephillin are removed before
Hallel; on New Moon, before the Additional Service*.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast commanded us to read the
Hallel.

Psalm cxiii.

Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the name
of the Lord. Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth
and for evermore. From the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof
the Lord's name is to be praised. The Lord is high above all nations,
and his glory above the heavens. Who is like unto the Lord our God, that
dwelleth so high; that looketh down so low upon the heavens and the
earth? He raiseth up the lowly out of the dust, and lifteth up the needy
from the dunghill; that he may set him with princes, even with the
princes of his people. He maketh the barren woman dwell in her house as
a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the Lord.

Psalm cxiv.

When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of
strange language; Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion. The
sea saw it, and fled; Jordan turned back. The mountains

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. What aileth thee, O thou sea,
that thou fleest? thou Jordan, that thou turnest back? Ye mountains,
that ye skip like rams? Ye hills, like lambs? At the presence of the
Lord tremble, O earth, at the presence of the God of Jacob; who turned
the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.

*On New Moon and the last Six Days of Passover omit the following
paragraph:—*

Psalm cxv.

Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy
lovingkindness and for the truth's sake. Wherefore should the nations
say, Where, then, is their God? But our God is in the heavens, he doeth
whatsoever he pleaseth. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of
men's hands. They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but
they see not. They have ears, but they hear not; noses have they, but
they smell not. As for their hands, they touch not; as for their feet,
they walk not; they give no sound through their throat. They that make
them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them. O
Israel, trust thou in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. O
house of Aaron, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their shield. Ye
that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord: he is their help and their
shield.

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

The Lord hath been mindful of us; he will bless, he will bless the house
of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron. He will bless them that
fear the Lord both small and great. May the Lord increase you, you and
your children. Blessed are ye of the Lord, why, made heaven and earth.
The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth hath he given to
the children of men. The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go
down into silence; but we will bless the Lord from this time forth and
for evermore. Praise ye the Lord.

*On New Moon and the Iasi Sir Days of Passover omit the following
paragraph:—*

Psalm cxvi.

I love the Lord, because he heareth my voice and my supplications.
Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him
as long as I live. The cords of death had encompassed me, and the
straits of the grave had come upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. Then
I called upon the name of the Lord: O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my
soul. Gracious is the Lord and righteous: yea, our God is merciful. The
Lord guardeth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me. Return
unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, my
feet from falling. I shall walk before the Lord in the land of the
living. I kept my faith in God ever when I spake, I am greatly
afflicted; even when I said in my haste, All men are liars.

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

What can I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I will
lift the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord. I will
pay my vows unto the Lord, yea, in the presence of all his people.
Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his loving ones. Ah,
Lord, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid;
thou hast loosed my bonds. I will offer to thee the sacrifice of
thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the Lord. I will pay my
vows unto the Lord, yea, in the presence of all his people; in the
courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye
the Lord.

Psalm cxvii.

O praise the Lord, all ye nations; laud him, all ye peoples. For his
lovingkindness is mighty over us; and the truth of the Lord endureth for
ever. Praise ye the Lord.

*The following verses are chanted by the Reader, the Congregation at the
end of each verse repeating, "O give thanks," etc., to "ever."*

Psalm cxviii.

O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his lovingkindness
endureth for ever.

O let Israel say, that his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

O let the house of Aaron say, that his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

O let them that fear the Lord say, that his lovingkindness endureth for
ever.

Out of my straitness I called upon the Lord: the Lord answered me with
enlargement. The Lord is for me, I will not fear: what can man do unto
me? The Lord is for me among them that help me; therefore shall I see my
desire on them that hate me. It is better to trust in the Lord than to
confide in man.

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is better to
trust in the Lord than to confide in princes. All nations compassed me
about: in the name of the Lord I surely cut them down. They compassed me
about; yea, they compassed me about: in the name of the Lord I surely
cut them down. They compassed me about like bees;—they were extinguished
as a fire of thorns:—in the name of the Lord I surely cut them down.
Thou didst thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the Lord helped me.
The Lord is my strength and song; and he is become my salvation. The
voice of exulting and salvation is in the tents of the righteous: the
right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. The right hand of the Lord is
exalted: the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. I shall not die,
but live, and recount the works of the Lord. The Lord hath chastened me
sore: but he hath not given me over unto death. Open to me the gates of
righteousness: I will enter into them, I will give thanks unto the Lord.
This is the gate of the Lord; the righteous may enter into it.

I will give thanks unto thee, for thou hast answered me, and art become
my salvation.

*Repeat this and the next three verses*.

The stone which the builders rejected is become the head-stone of the
corner.

This was the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.

This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will be glad and rejoice
thereon.

*Reader and Congregation:—*

Save, we beseech thee, O Lord.

Save, we beseech thee, O Lord.

We beseech thee, O Lord, send prosperity.

We beseech thee, O Lord. send prosperity.

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord: we bless you out of
the house of the Lord.

*Repeat this and the next three verses*.

The Lord is God, he hath given us light: bind the festal offering with
cords, even unto the horns of the altar.

Thou art my God, and I will give thanks unto thee: thou art my God, I
will exalt thee.

O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his lovingkindness
endureth for ever.

All thy works shall praise thee, O Lord our God, and thy pious ones, the
just who do thy will, together with all thy people, the house of Israel,
shall with exultation thank, bless, praise, glorify, exalt, reverence,
sanctify and ascribe sovereignty unto thy name, O our King; for it is
good to give thanks unto thee, and becoming to sing praises unto thy
name, because from everlasting to everlasting thou art God. Blessed art
thou, O Lord, a King extolled with praises.
