### PRAYER ON ENTERING THE SYNAGOGUE.

*On entering the Synagogue say the following:—*

As for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy
house: I will worship toward thy holy temple in the fear of thee.

Into the house of God we will walk with the throng.

How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, thy dwelling places, O Israel! As for
me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: I
will worship toward thy holy temple in the fear of thee. Lord, I love
the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy glory dwelleth. As
for me, I will worship and bow down: I will bend the knee before the
Lord, my Maker. And as for me, may my prayer unto thee, O Lord, be in an
acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness, answer
me in the truth of thy salvation.
