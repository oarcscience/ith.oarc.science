Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### MORNING SERVICE.

1\. Magnified and praised be the living God: he is, and there is no
limit in time unto his being.

2\. He is One, and there is no unity like unto his unity; inconceivable
is he, and unending is his unity.

3\. He hath neither bodily form nor substance: we can compare nought
unto him in his holiness.

4\. He was before anything that hath been created—even the first: but
his existence had no beginning.

5\. Behold he is the Lord of the universe: to every creature he teacheth
his greatness and his sovereignty.

6\. The rich gift of his prophecy he gave unto the men of his choice, in
whom he gloried.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

7\. There hath never yet arisen in Israel a prophet like unto Moses, one
who hath beheld his similitude,

8\. The Law of truth God gave unto his people by the hand of his prophet
who was faithful in his house.

9\. God will not alter nor change his Law to everlasting for any other.

10\. He watcheth and knoweth our secret thoughts: he beholdeth the end
of a thing before it existeth.

11\. He bestoweth lovingkindness upon a man according to his work; he
giveth to the wicked evil according to his wickedness.

12\. He will send our anointed at the end of days, to redeem them that
wait for the end—his salvation.

13\. In the abundance of his lovingkindness God will quicken the dead.
Blessed for evermore be his glorious name.

He is Lord of the universe, who reigned ere any creature yet was formed:

At the time when all things were made by his desire, then was his name
proclaimed King.

And after all things shall have had an end, he alone, the dreaded one,
shall reign;

Who was, who is, and who will be in glory.

And he is One, and there is no second to compare to him, to consort with
him:

Without beginning, without end: to him belong strength and dominion.

And he is my God—my Redeemer liveth—and a rock in my travail in time of
distress;

And he is my banner and my refuge, the portion of my cup on the day when
I call.

Into his hand I commend my spirit, when I sleep and when I wake:

And with my spirit, my body also: the Lord is with me, and I will not
fear.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
sanctified us by thy commandments, and given us command concerning the
washing of the hands.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast formed
man in wisdom, and created in him many orifices and vessels. It is
revealed and known before the throne of thy glory, that if one of these
be opened, or one of those be closed, it would be impossible to exist
and to stand before thee. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who healest all
flesh and doest wondrously.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
sanctified us by thy commandments, and commanded us to occupy ourselves
with the words of the Law.

Make pleasant, therefore, we beseech thee, O Lord our God, the words of
thy Law in our mouth and in the mouth of thy people, the house of
Israel, so that we with our offspring and the offspring of thy people,
the house of Israel, may all know thy name and learn thy Law. Blessed
art thou, O Lord, who teachest the Law to thy people Israel.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast chosen
us from all nations and given us thy Law. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who
givest the Law.

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon
thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn his face unto thee, and
give thee peace.

Mishnah. Treatise Peah, ch. i.

These are the things which have no fixed measure (by enactment of the
Law): the corners of the field, the first fruits, the offerings brought
on appearing before the Lord at the three festivals, the practice of
charity and the study of the Law.—These are the things, the fruits of
which a man enjoys in this world, while the stock remains for him for
the world to come: viz., honoring father and mother, the practice of
charity, timely attendance at the house of study morning and evening,
hospitality to wayfarers, visiting the sick, dowering the bride,
attending the dead to the grave, devotion in prayer, and making peace
between man and his fellow; but the study of the Law is equal to them
all.

O my God, the soul which thou gavest me is pure; thou didst create it,
thou didst form it, thou didst breathe it into me; thou preservest it
within me; and thou wilt take it from me, but wilt restore it unto me
hereafter. So long as the soul is within me, I will give thanks unto
thee, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, Sovereign of all works, Lord
of all souls! Blessed art thou, O Lord, who restorest souls unto dead
bodies.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the un verse, who hast given
to the cock intelligence to distinguish between day and night.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast not
made me a heathen.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast not
made me a bondman.

*Men say:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast not
made me a woman.

*Women say:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast made me
according to thy will.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who openest the
eyes of the blind.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who clothest the
naked.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who loosest them
that are bound.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who raisest up
them that are bowed down.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who spreadest
forth the earth above the waters.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
supplied my every want.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast made
firm the steps of man.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who girdest
Israel with might.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the. universe, who crownest
Israel with glory.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who givest
strength to the weary.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who removest
sleep from mine eyes and slumber from mine eyelids.

And may it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, to make
us familiar with thy Law, and to make us cleave to thy commandments,

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> O lead us not into
the power of sin, or of transgression or iniquity, or of temptation, or
of scorn: let not the evil inclination have sway over us: keep us far
from a bad man and a bad companion: make us cleave to the good
inclination and to good works: subdue our inclination so that it may
submit itself unto thee; and let us obtain this day, and every day,
grace, favor and mercy in thine eyes, and in the eyes of all who behold
us; and bestow lovingkindnesses upon us. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who
bestowest lovingkindnesses upon thy people Israel.

May it be thy will, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, to deliver me
this day, and every day, from arrogant men and from arrogance, from a
bad mar., from a bad companion and from a bad neighbor, and from any
mishap, and from the adversary that destroyeth; from a hard judgment,
and from a hard opponent, whether he be a son of the covenant or be not
a son or the covenant.

At all times let a man fear God as well in private as in public,
acknowledge the truth, and speak the truth in his heart; and let him
rise early and say:

Sovereign of all worlds! Not because of our righteous acts do we lay our
supplications before thee, but because of thine abundant mercies. What
are we? What is our life? What is our piety? What our righteousness?

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

What our helpfulness? What our strength? What our might? What shall we
say before thee, O Lord our God and God of our fathers? Are not all the
mighty men as nought before thee, the men of renown as though they had
not been, the wise as if without knowledge, and the men of understanding
as if without discernment? For most of their works are void, and the
days of their lives are vanity before thee, and the pre-eminence of man
over the beast is nought, for all is vanity.

Nevertheless we are thy people, the children of thy covenant, the
children of Abraham, thy friend, to whom thou didst swear on Mount
Moriah; the seed of Isaac, his only son, who was bound upon the altar
the congregation of Jacob, thy first barn son, whose name thou didst
call Israel and Jeshurun by reason of the love wherewith thou didst love
him, and the joy wherewith thou didst rejoice in him.

It is, therefore, our duty to thank, praise and glorify thee, to bless,
to sanctify and to offer praise and thanksgiving unto thy name. Happy
are we! how goodly is our portion, and how pleasant is our lot, and how
beautiful our heritage! Happy are we who, early and late, morning and
evening, twice every day, declare:

Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One. Blessed be His name,
whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

Thou wast the same ere the world was created; thou hast been the same
since the world hath been created; thou art the same in this world, and
thou wilt be the same in the world to come. Sanctify thy name upon them
that sanctify it, yea, sanctify thy name throughout thy world; and
through thy salvation let our horn be exalted and raised on high.
Blessed art thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest thy name amongst the many,

Thou art the Lord our God in heaven and on earth, and in the highest
heaven of heavens. Verily thou art the first and thou art the last, and
beside thee there is no God. O gather them that hope for thee from the
four corners of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive
and know that thou art God, thou alone, over all the kingdoms of the
earth. Thou hast made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is
therein; and which among all the works of thy hands, whether among those
above or among those beneath, can say unto thee, What doest thou? Our
Father who art in heaven, deal kindly with us for the sake of thy great
name by which we are called; and fulfil unto us, O Lord our God, that
which is written, At that time will I bring you in, and at that time
will I gather you; for I will make you

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring
back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord.

Numbers xxviii. 1–8.

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Command the children of Israel,
and say unto them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire,
of a sweet savor unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in its due
season. And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire
which ye shall offer unto the Lord; he-lambs of the first year without
blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt offering. The one lamb
shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at
even; and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering,
mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil. It is a continual
burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai f or a sweet savor, an
offering made by fire unto the Lord. And the drink offering thereof
shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place
shalt thou pour out a drink offering of strong drink unto the Lord. And
the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meal offering of the
morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, an
offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.

Leviticus i. 11.

And he shall slay it on the side of the altar northward before the Lord:
and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar
round about.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

*On Sabbath the following is added:—*

Numbers xxviii. 9, 10.

And on the sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year without blemish,
and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering,
mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof: this is the burnt
offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and the
drink offering thereof.

*On New Moon the following is added:—*

Numbers xxviii. 11–15.

And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering
unto the Lord; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs of the
first year without blemish; and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine
flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two
tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, for the
one ram; and a several tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a
meal offering unto every lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savor, an
offering made by fire unto the Lord. And their drink offerings shall be
half an hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of an hin for the
ram, and the fourth part of an hin for a lamb: this is the burnt
offering of every month throughout the months of the year. And one
the-goat for a sin offering unto the Lord; it shall be offered beside
the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering thereof.

Mishnah, Treatise Zebachim, ch. v.

1\. Which are the places where the sacrifices were offered?—Those that
were most holy were slain on the north side of the altar: the bull and
the he-goat of the Day of Atonement were slain on the north side; their
blood was received in a vessel of ministry on the north side, and had to
be sprinkled between the staves of the ark, and towards the veil, and
upon the golden altar: one of these sprinklings omitted rendered the
whole ceremony invalid. The remaining blood the priest poured out at the
western base of the outer altar; if, however, he did not do so, the
omission did not render the ceremony invalid.

2\. The bulls and he-goats which were to be wholly burnt. were slain on
the north side; their blood was received in a vessel of ministry on the
north side, and had to be sprinkled towards the veil and upon the golden
altar: one of these sprinklings omitted rendered the whole ceremony
invalid. The remaining blood the priest poured out at the western base
of the outer altar; if, however, he failed to do so, it did not render
the ceremony invalid: both these and the preceding offerings were burnt
in the repository of ashes.

3\. The sin offerings of the congregation and of the individual.—These
are the sin offerings of the congregation: the he-goats offered on the
new moon and on the festivals. They were slain on the north side; their
blood was received in a vessel of ministry on the north side, and of
this blood four sprinklings had to be made, one upon each of the four
corners of the altar. How was this done? The priest went up the ascent,
passed on to the middle terrace that surrounded the altar, and came
successively to the

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

south-east, the north-east, the north-west and the south-west corners.
The remaining blood he poured out at the southern base of the altar.
These sacrifices might be eaten, dressed after any manner, by the males
of the priesthood, within the hangings of the court, the same day and
evening until midnight.

4\. The burnt offering belonged to the class of the most holy. It was
slain on the north side; its blood was received in a vessel of ministry
on the north side; and of its blood two sprinklings had to be made (at
opposite angles of the altar) so as to constitute four, (a portion of
the blood thus reaching each of the four sides of the altar). This
offering had also to be flayed, dismembered and totally consumed by
fire.

5\. The peace offerings of the congregation and the trespass
offerings.—These are the trespass offerings: the trespass offerings for
robbery, for profane appropriation of sanctified objects, for carnally
knowing a handmaid already promised in marriage; the trespass offering
of a Nazirite who has become defiled by a dead body; the trespass
offering of a leper at his cleansing; the trespass offering of one who
is in doubt whether he has committed an act that has to be atoned for by
a sin offering. All these were slain on the north side; their blood was
received in a vessel of ministry on the north side; and of their blood
two sprinklings had to be made at the altar in such a manner as to
constitute four. These sacrifices might be eaten, dressed after any
manner, by the males of the priesthood, within the hangings of the
court, the same day and evening until midnight.

6\. The thank offering and the ram of the Nazirite were holy in a minor
degree. They might be slain in any part of the court, of their blood two
sprinklings

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

had to be made at the altar in such a manner as to constitute four; and
they might be eaten, dressed after any manner, by any person, in any
part of the city, the same day and until midnight. To the portions
thereof belonging to the priests the same rule 'applied as to the rest,
except that the former might only be eaten by the priests, their wives,
their children and their slaves.

7\. The peace offerings were also holy in a minor degree. They might be
slain in any part of the court; of their blood two sprinklings had to be
made at the altar in such a manner as to constitute four, and they might
be eaten, dressed after any manner, by any person, in any part of the
city, during two days and one night. To the portions thereof belonging
to the priests the same rule applied as to the rest, except that the
former might only be eaten by the priests, their wives, their children
and their slaves.

8\. The first-born, the tithe of cattle and the paschal lamb were
likewise holy in a minor degree. They might be slain in any part of the
court; only one sprinkling of their blood had to be made; this, however,
had to be done towards the base of the altar. In respect to their
consumption the following differences prevailed: the first-born might be
eaten only by the priests, while the tithe might be eaten by any person:
both might be eaten, dressed after any manner, in any part of the city,
during two days and one night. The paschal lamb might only be eaten the
same evening until midnight; it might be partaken of by none but the
previously appointed number of persons, and it might only be eaten
roasted.

Boraitha d’R. Ishmael.

<span class="small">Rabbi Ishmael says: There are thirteen exegetical
principles</span>

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

<span class="small">by which the Law is expounded:—1. The inference from
minor to major. 2. The inference from a similarity of phrases. 3. A
general law may be derived by induction from different cases which,
occurring in the same or in different verses, have yet some feature in
common. 4. A general proposition followed by the enumeration of
particulars already comprehended in the general proposition, (in which
case the scope of the proposition is limited by the things specified) 5.
An enumeration of particulars followed by a general proposition in which
they are also comprehended, (in which case the scope of the proposition
extends also to the things not specified). 6. Two general propositions,
separated from each other by an enumeration of particulars, include only
such things as are similar to those specified 7. An inference drawn from
a general proposition complemented by a particular term, and an
inference drawn from a particular term complemented by a general
proposition. 8. If anything is included in a general proposition and is
then made the subject of a special statement, that which is predicated
of it is not to be understood as limited to itself alone, but is to be
applied to the whole of the general proposition 9. If anything is
included in a general proposition, and is then singled out in order to
be made the subject of a special statement, similar to the general
proposition, this particularisation is intended, so far as its subject
is concerned, to lessen and not to add to its restrictions. 10. If
anything is included in a general proposition, and is then singled out
in order to be made the subject of a special statement, not similar to
the general proposition, this particularisation is intended in some
respects to lessen and in others to add to its restrictions. 11. If
anything is included in a general proposition, and is then made the
subject of a fresh statement (not in harmony with the former), the terms
of the general proposition will not apply to it, unless the Scripture
distinctly indicates that they shall apply. 12. The meaning of a passage
may be deduced from its context, or from some subsequent passage. 13.
Similarly, when two passages are in contradiction to each other, the
explanation can be determined only when a third text is found, capable
of harmonizing the two.</span>

May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the
temple be speedily rebuilt in our days and grant our portion in thy Law.
And there we will serve thee with awe, as in the days of old, and as in
ancient years.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

*Before putting on the Tallith, say the following:—*

I am here enwrapping myself in this fringed robe, in fulfilment of the
command of my Creator, as it is written in the Law, They shall make them
a fringe upon the corners of their garments throughout their
generations. And even as I cover myself with the Tallith in this world,
so may my soul deserve to be clothed with a beauteous spiritual robe in
the world to come, in the garden of Eden. Amen.

*On putting on the Tallith, say:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast commanded us to enwrap
ourselves in the fringed garment.

How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God! And the children of men take
refuge under the shadow of thy wings. They sate themselves with the
fatness of thy house; and thou givest them to drink of the river of thy
pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light do we see
light. O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee, and thy
righteousness to the upright in heart.

*Meditation before laying the Tephillin*.

I am here intent upon the act of laying the Tephillin, in fulfilment of
the command of my Creator, who hath commanded us to lay the Tephillin,
as it is written in the Law, And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. Within
these Tephillin are placed four sections of the Law, <span
id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md) that declare the absolute

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

unity of God, and that remind us of the miracles and wonders which he
wrought for us when he brought us forth from Egypt, even he who hath
power over the highest and the lowest to deal with them according to his
will. He hath commanded us to lay the Tephillin upon the hand as a
memorial of his outstretched arm; opposite the heart, to indicate the
duty of subjecting the longings and designs of our heart to his service,
blessed be he; and upon the head over against the brain, thereby
teaching that the mind, whose seat is in the brain, together with all
senses and faculties, is to be subjected to his service, blessed be he.
May the effect of the precept thus observed be to extend to me long life
with sacred influences and holy thoughts, free from every approach, even
in imagination, to sin and iniquity. May the evil inclination not
mislead or entice us, but may we be led to serve the Lord as it is in
our hearts to do. Amen.

*On placing the Tephillah on the arm, say:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast commanded us to lay the
Tephillin.

*On placing the Tephillah on the forehead, say:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast given us command concerning
the precept of the Tephillin.

<span class="small">Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is for
ever and ever.</span>

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

*The Retsuah is placed thrice round the middle finger, and the following
is said:—*

And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto
me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in
mercy: I will even betroth thee to me in faithfulness; and thou shalt
know the Lord.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*In some Congregations Psalm xxx (page [103](spb07.htm#page_103).md) is
said here*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blessed be he who spake, and the world existed: blessed be he: blessed
be he who was the maker of the world in the beginning: blessed be he who
speaketh and doeth: blessed be he who decreeth and performeth: blessed
be he who hath mercy upon the earth: blessed be he who hath mercy upon
his creatures: blessed be he who payeth a good reward to them that fear
him: blessed be he who liveth for ever, and endureth to eternity:
blessed be he who redeemeth and delivereth: blessed be his name.—Blessed
art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, O God and merciful
Father, praised by the mouth of thy people, lauded and glorified by the
tongue of thy loving ones and thy servants. We also will praise thee, O
Lord our God, with the songs of David thy servant; with praises and
psalms we will magnify, laud and glorify thee, and we will make mention
of thy name, and proclaim thee our King, O our

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> God, thou the only
one, the life of all worlds. O King, praised and glorified be thy great
name for ever and ever. Blessed art thou, O Lord, a King extolled with
praises.

1 Chron. xvi. 8–36.

O give thanks unto the Lord, call upon his name; make known his doings
among the peoples. Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; tell ye of all
his marvellous works. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them
rejoice that seek the Lord. Search ye for the Lord and his strength;
seek ye his face evermore. Remember his marvellous works that he hath
done: his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; O ye seed of Israel,
his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. He is the Lord our
God: his judgments are in all the earth. Remember his covenant for ever,
the word which he commanded to a thousand generations; (the covenant)
which he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; and confirmed the
same unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant:
saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, as the lot of your
inheritance: when ye were but a few men in number; yea, few, and
sojourners in it; and they went about from nation to nation, and from
one kingdom to another people. He suffered no man to oppress them; yea,
he rebuked kings for their sakes; (saying), Touch not mine

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm. Sing unto the Lord, all the
earth; proclaim his salvation from day to day. Recount his glory among
the nations, his marvels among all the peoples. For great is the Lord,
and exceedingly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. For
all the gods of the peoples are things of nought; but the Lord made the
heavens. Grandeur and majesty are before him: strength and gladness are
in his place. Give unto the Lord, ye families of the peoples, give unto
the Lord glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his
name: take an offering, and come before him: worship the Lord in the
beauty of holiness. Tremble before him all the earth; the world also is
set firm, that it cannot be moved. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the
earth be glad; and let them say among the nations, The Lord reigneth.
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; let the plain exult, and all
that is therein. Then shall the trees of the forest exult before the
Lord, for he cometh to judge the earth. O give thanks unto the Lord; for
he is good: for his lovingkindness endureth forever. And say ye, Save
us, O God of our salvation, and gather us and deliver us from the
nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy
praise. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to
everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the Lord.

Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool;

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

holy is he. Exalt ye the Lord our God, aim worship at his holy mount;
for the Lord our God is holy. And he, being merciful, forgiveth
iniquity, and destroyeth not: yea, many a time he turneth his anger
away, and doth not stir up all his wrath. Withhold not thou thy tender
mercies from me, O Lord: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth
continually preserve me. Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy
lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old. Ascribe ye strength
unto God: his majesty is over Israel, and his strength is in the skies.
O God, thou art to be feared out of thy holy places: the God of Israel
he giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God. O God of
vengeance, Lord, O God of vengeance, shine forth. Lift up thyself, thou
judge of the earth: render to the proud their desert. Salvation
belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing be upon thy people. (Selah.) The
Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. (Selah. )
O Lord of hosts, happy is the man that trusteth in thee. Save, .Lord:
may the King answer us on the day when we call. Save thy people, and
bless thine inheritance: feed them, and carry them for ever Our soul
waiteth for the Lord: he is our help and our shield. For our heart shall
rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. Let thy
lovingkindness, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped for thee.
Show us thy lovingkindness, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation. Rise up
for our help and set

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

us free for thy lovingkindness’ sake. I am the Lord thy God, who brought
thee up out of the land of Egypt: open wide thy mouth and I will fill
it. Happy is the people, that is in such a case: happy is the people,
whose God is the Lord. And as for me, I have trusted in thy
lovingkindness; my heart shall be glad in thy salvation: I will sing
unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.

*The following Psalm is omitted on Sabbaths, Holydays, the day before
Passover, the Intermediate days of Passover, and on the day before the
Day of Atonement*.

Psalm c.

A Psalm of Thanksgiving. Shout for joy unto the Lord, all ye lands.
Serve the Lord with joy: come before him with exulting. Know ye that the
Lord he is God: he hath made us, and we are his, his people and the
sheep of his pasture. Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into
his courts with praise: give thanks unto him, bless his name. For the
Lord is good; his lovingkindness is everlasting; and his faithfulness
from generation to generation.

*On Sabbaths and Holydays, and on Hoshana Rabba, the following Psalms
are said:—*

Psalm xix.

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The heavens recount the glory
of God, and the firmament declareth his handiwork. Day unto day poureth
forth speech, and night unto night proclaimeth knowledge.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> There is no speech
nor language; their voice cannot be heard. Their sound is gone out
through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world; in them
hath he set a tent for the sun. And he is as a bridegroom coming out of
his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course. His going
forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of
it: and there is nothing hid from his heat.—The law of the Lord is
perfect, restoring the soul: the testimony of the Lord is faithful,
making wise the simple. The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing
the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever; the judgments of the
Lord are truthful, righteous altogether. More to be desired are they
than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the
droppings of the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: in
keeping them there is great reward. Who can discern his errors? Clear
thou me from hidden faults. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous
sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be blameless, and
I shall be clear from great transgression. Let the words of my mouth and
the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock
and my Redeemer.

Psalm xxxiv.

<span class="small">A Psalm of David; when he changed his behavior
before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.</span>

I will bless the Lord at all times: his praise shall continually be in
my mouth.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the meek shall hear and
rejoice.

O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.

I sought the Lord, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my
fears.

They looked unto him. and shone with joy: and their faces shall not be
confounded.

This sufferer cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all
his troubles.

The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and
delivereth them.

O taste and see that the Lord is good: happy is the man that taketh
refuge in him.

O fear the Lord, ye his holy ones: for there is no want to them that
fear him.

Young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord
shall not want any good.

Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the
Lord.

What man is he that delighteth in life, and loveth many days that he may
see good?

Keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile.

Depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.

The eyes of the Lord are towards the righteous, and his ears are towards
their cry.

The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the
remembrance of them from the earth.

(The righteous) cry, and the Lord hearkeneth, and delivereth them out of
all their troubles.

The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such
as are of a contrite spirit.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

Many are the evil fortunes of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him
out of them all.

He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

Evil shall slay the wicked; and they that hate the righteous shall be
condemned.

The Lord setteth free the soul of his servants; and none that take
refuge in. him shall be condemned.

Psalm xc.

A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. O Lord, thou hast been a dwelling
place unto us in all generations. Before the mountains were brought
forth, or ever thou gavest birth to the earth and the world, even from
everlasting to everlasting thou art God. Thou turnest man back to dust,
and sayest, Return, ye children of men. For a thousand years in thy
sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.
Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are in a sleep: in the
morning they are like grass which sprouteth afresh. In the morning it
bloometh and sprouteth afresh; in the evening it is cut down, and
withereth. For we are consumed by thine anger, and in thy wrath are we
confounded. Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in
the light of thy countenance. For all our days have passed away in thy
wrath, we bring our years to an end like a sound. The days of our years
are threescore years and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore
years; yet is their pride but travail and nothingness; for it is soon
gone by, and we fly away. Who knoweth the power of thine anger, and thy
wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee? So teach us to number
our days, that we may get us a heart of wisdom. Return, O Lord; how
long?—and repent thee concerning thy

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

servants. O satisfy us in the morning with thy lovingkindness; that we
may exult and rejoice all our days. Make us rejoice according to the
days wherein thou hast afflicted us, the years wherein we have seen
evil. Let thy work be made manifest unto thy servants, and thy majesty
upon their children.

And let the pleasantness of the Lord our God be upon us; and establish
thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish
thou it.

Psalm xci.

He that dwelleth in the shelter of the Most High abideth under the
shadow of the Almighty. I say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my
fortress; my God, in whom I trust.—For he shall deliver thee from the
snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover
thee with his pinions, and under his wings shalt thou take refuge: his
truth shall be a shield and a buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid of the
terror by night, nor of the arrow that flieth by day; of the pestilence
that walketh in darkness, nor of the plague that ravageth at noon day. A
thousand may fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; it
shall not come nigh unto thee. Only .with thine eyes shalt thou look on,
and see the retribution of the wicked.—For thou, O Lord, art my
refuge.—Thou hast made the Most High thy dwelling place; there shall no
evil befall thee, neither shall any scourge come nigh thy tent. For he
shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy . ways.
They shall bear thee upon their hands, lest thou strike thy foot against
a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder; upon the young
lion and the serpent shalt thou trample.—Because he hath set his love
upon me,

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he knoweth
my name. When he calleth upon me, I will answer him; I will be with him
in trouble: I will deliver him and honor him. With length of days will I
satisfy him, and will let him see my salvation.

*Repeat the last verse*.

Psalm cxxxv.

Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye
servants of the Lord: ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the
courts of the house of our God. Praise ye the Lord; for the Lord is
good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant. For the Lord hath
chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. For I
know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
Whatsoever the Lord pleaseth, that doeth he, in heaven and in earth, in
the seas and in all deeps. He causeth vapors to ascend from the ends of
the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth forth the wind
out of his treasuries. It is he who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both
of man and beast. He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O
Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. It is he who smote great
nations, and slew mighty kings; Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king
of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan: and gave their land for an
heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people. Thy name, O Lord, endureth
for ever; thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations. For the Lord
shall judge his people, and repent himself concerning his servants,

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, but they speak. not; eyes have they, but they see not;
they have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their
mouths. They that make them shall become like unto them; yea, every one
that trusteth in them. O house of Israel, bless ye the Lord: O house of
Aaron, bless ye the Lord: O house of Levi, bless ye the Lord: ye that
fear the Lord, bless ye the Lord. Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, who
dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord.

Psalm cxxxvi.

O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his lovingkindness
endureth for ever.

O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his lovingkindness endureth for
ever.

O give thanks unto the Lord of lords: for his lovingkindness endureth
for ever.

To him who alone doeth great marvels: for his lovingkindness endureth
for ever.

To him that by understanding made the heavens: for his lovingkindness
endureth for ever.

To him that spread forth the earth above the waters: for his
lovingkindness endureth for ever.

To him that made great lights: for his loving kindness endureth for
ever.

The sun to rule by day: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

The moon and stars to rule by night: for his lovingkindness endureth for
ever.

To him that smote the Egyptians in their first born: for his
lovingkindness endureth for ever.

And brought out Israel from among them: for his lovingkindness endureth
for ever.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his lovingkindness
endureth for ever.

To him who parted the Red Sea in sunder: for his lovingkindness endureth
for ever.

And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his lovingkindness
endureth for ever.

But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea: for his
lovingkindness endureth for ever.

To him who led his people through the wilderness: for his lovingkindness
endureth for ever.

To him who smote great kings; for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

And slew mighty kings: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

Sihon king of the Amorites: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

And Og king of Bashan: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

And gave their land for an heritage: for his lovingkindness endureth for
ever.

Even an heritage under Israel his servant: for his lovingkindness
endureth for ever.

Who remembered us in our low estate: for his lovingkindness endureth for
ever.

And hath released us from our adversaries: for his lovingkindness
endureth for ever.

He giveth food to all flesh: for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.

O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his lovingkindness endureth
for ever.

Psalm xxxiii.

Exult in the Lord, O ye righteous: praise is seemly for the upright.
Give thanks unto the Lord with the lyre; sing praises unto him with the
harp of ten strings. Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with
shouts of joy. For the word of the Lord is right; and all his work is
done in faithfulness. He loveth righteousness

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

and justice: the earth is full of the lovingkindness of the Lord. By the
word of the Lord the heavens were made; and all the host of them by the
breath of his mouth. He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a
heap: he layeth up the floods in store-houses. Let all the earth fear
the Lord: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. For
he spake, and it was; he commanded, and it stood fast. The Lord hath
frustrated the design of the nations; he hath foiled the thoughts of the
peoples. The counsel of the Lord standeth fast for ever, the thoughts of
his heart to all generations. Happy is the nation whose god is the Lord;
the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. The Lord looketh
down from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men; from the place of
his habitation he gazeth upon all the inhabitants of the earth; he that
fashioneth the hearts of them all, that giveth heed to all their works.
A king is not saved by greatness of power: a mighty man is not delivered
by greatness of strength. A horse is a vain thing for safety: neither
shall he rescue any by his great power. Behold the eye of the Lord is
upon them that fear him, upon them that hope for his lovingkindness to
deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. Our
soul waiteth for the Lord: he is our help and our shield. For our heart
shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. Let thy
lovingkindness, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped for thee.

Psalm xcii.

A Psalm, a Song for the Sabbath Day. It is a good thing to give thanks
unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High: to
declare thy lovingkindness

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, with an instrument of
ten strings and with a harp, with thoughtful music upon the lyre. For
thou, O Lord, hast made me rejoice through thy work: I will exult in the
work of thy hands. How great are thy works, O Lord: thy thoughts are
very deep. A brutish man knoweth it not, neither doth a fool understand
this: when the wicked sprang up as the grass, and all the workers of
iniquity flourished, it was that they might be destroyed for ever. But
thou, O Lord, art on high for evermore. For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord,
for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall
be scattered. But my horn hast thou exalted, like that of the wild-ox: I
am anointed with fresh oil. Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine
enemies; mine ears have heard my desire of them that rose up against me,
doers of evil. The righteous shall spring up like a palm-tree; he shall
grow tall like a cedar in Lebanon. Planted in the house of the Lord,
they shall blossom in the courts of our God. They shall still shoot
forth in old age; they shall be full of sap and green: to declare that
the Lord is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in
him.

Psalm xciii.

The Lord reigneth; he hath robed him in majesty; the Lord hath robed
him, yea, he hath girded himself with strength: the world also is set
firm, that it cannot be moved. Thy throne is set firm from of old: thou
art from everlasting. The streams have lifted up, O Lord, the streams
have lifted tip their voice; the streams lift up their roaring. Than the
voices of many waters, mighty waters, breakers of the sea, more mighty
is the Lord on high.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thy testimonies
are very faithful: holiness becometh thine house, O Lord, for evermore.

*On Weekdays continue here from [p. 23](#page_23.md)*.

Let the glory of the Lord endure for ever; let the Lord rejoice in his
works. Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for
evermore. From the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof the
Lord's name is to be praised. The Lord is high above all nations, and
his glory above the heavens. Thy name, O Lord, endureth for ever; thy
memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations. The Lord hath established
his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. Let the
heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; and let them say among the
nations, The Lord reigneth. The Lord reigneth; the Lord hath reigned;
the Lord shall reign for ever and ever. The Lord is King for ever and
ever; the nations are perished out of his land. The Lord hath frustrated
the design of the nations; he hath foiled the thoughts of the peoples.
Many are the thoughts in a man's heart; but the counsel of the Lord,
that shall stand. The counsel of the Lord standeth fast for ever, the
thoughts of his heart to all generations. For he spake, and it was; he
commanded, and it stood fast. For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath
desired it for his habitation. For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto
himself, Israel for his peculiar treasure. For the Lord will not cast
off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance. And he, being
merciful, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

not: yea, many a time he turneth his anger away, and doth not stir up
all his wrath. Save, Lord: may the King answer us on the day when we
call.

Happy are they that dwell in thy house: they will be ever praising thee.
(Selah.)

Happy is the people, that is in such a case: happy is the people, whose
God is the Lord.

Psalm cxlv. A Psalm of Praise: of David.

I will extol thee, my God, O King; and I will bless thy name for ever
and ever.

Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and
ever.

Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised: and his greatness is
unsearchable.

One generation shall laud thy works to another, and shall declare thy
mighty acts.

On the majestic glory of thy splendor, and on thy marvellous deeds, will
I meditate.

And men shall speak of the might of thy awful acts; and I will recount
thy greatness.

They shall pour forth the fame of thy great goodness and shall exult in
thy righteousness.

The Lord is gracious and merciful; slow to anger and of great
lovingkindness.

The Lord is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works.

All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O Lord; and thy loving ones
shall bless thee.

They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the majestic glory
of his kingdom.

Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth
throughout all generations.

The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that are
bowed down.

The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their food in due
season.

Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest every living thing with favor.

The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and loving in all his works.

The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him. to all that call upon
him in truth.

He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; he also will hear their
cry and will save them.

The Lord guardeth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he
destroy.

My mouth shall speak of the praise of the Lord; and let all flesh bless
his holy name for ever and ever.

But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise
ye the Lord.

Psalm cxlvi.

Praise ye the Lord. Praise the Lord, O my soul: I will praise the Lord,
while I live; I will sing praises unto my God while I have my being. Put
not your trust

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no help, When his breath
goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his designs
perish. Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope
is in the Lord, his God: who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
that is therein; who keepeth truth for ever; who executeth judgment for
the oppressed; who giveth food to the hungry: the Lord looseth the
prisoners; the Lord openeth the eyes of the blind; the Lord raiseth up
them that are bowed down; the Lord loveth the righteous; the Lord
guardeth the strangers; he upholdeth the fatherless and widow; but the
way of the wicked he maketh crooked. The Lord shall reign for ever, thy
God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.

Psalm cxlvii.

Praise ye the Lord; for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it
is pleasant, and praise is seemly. The Lord doth build up Jerusalem; he
gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. He healeth the broken in
heart, and bindeth up their wounds. He counteth the number of the stars;
he calleth them all by their names. Great is our Lord, and mighty in
power; his understanding is infinite. The Lord upholdeth the meek; he
abaseth the wicked to the ground. Sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving;
sing praises upon the lyre unto our God: who covereth the heaven with
clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to sprout
upon the mountains; who giveth to the beast its food,

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

and to the young ravens which cry. He deligheth not in the strength of
the horse, he taketh no pleasure in the vigor of a man. The Lord taketh
pleasure in them that fear him, in them that hope for his
lovingkindness. Extol the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion. For
he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children
within thee. He maketh peace in thy borders; he satisfieth thee with the
fat of wheat. He sendeth out his commandment to the earth; his word
runneth very swiftly. He giveth snow like wool; he scattereth hoar frost
like ashes. He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before
his cold? He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind
to blow, and the waters flow. He declareth his words unto Jacob, his
statutes and his judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any
nation: and as for his judgments, they do not know them. Praise ye the
Lord.

Psalm cxlviii

Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: praise him in
the heights. Praise ye him, all his angels; praise ye him, all his host.
Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise
him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that are above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of the Lord: for he commanded, and they were
created. He hath established them for ever and ever: he gave a decree
which none shall transgress. Praise the Lord from the earth,

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

ye sea-monsters and all deeps: fire and hail, snow and smoke; stormy
wind, fulfilling his word: mountains and all hills; fruit trees and all
cedars: wild beasts and all cattle; creeping things and winged birds:
kings of the earth and all peoples; princes and all judges of the earth:
both young men and maidens; old men and children: let them praise the
name of the Lord; for his name alone is exalted: his majesty is above
the earth and heaven. And he hath lifted up a horn for his people, to
the praise of all his loving ones: even of the children of Israel, the
people near unto him: praise ye the Lord.

Psalm cxlix.

Praise ye the Lord. Sing unto the Lord a new song; his praise in the
assembly of those that love him. Let Israel rejoice in his Maker: let
the children of Zion be glad in their King. Let them praise his name
with the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and
lyre. For the Lord taketh pleasure in his people: he adorneth the meek
with salvation. Let those that love him triumph in glory: let them exult
upon their beds. High praises of God are in their throat, and a
two-edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the nations,
and punishments upon the peoples: to bind their kings with chains, and
their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment
written: this is an honor for all his loving ones. Praise ye the Lord.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

Psalm cl.

Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the
firmament of his power. Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him
according to his abundant greatness. Praise him with the blast of the
horn: praise him with the harp and the lyre. Praise him with the timbrel
and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and the pipe. Praise him
with the clear-toned cymbals; praise him with the loud-sounding cymbals.
Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord: praise ye the Lord.

*The last verse is repeated*.

Blessed he the Lord for evermore. Amen, and Amen. Blessed be the Lord
out of Zion, who dwelleth in Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord. Blessed be
the Lord God, the God of Israel, who alone doeth wondrous things: and
blessed be his glorious name for ever; and let the whole earth be filled
with his glory. Amen, and Amen.

*The following to "worship thee," [p. 40](#page_40.md), is said standing*.

1 Chron. xxix. 10–13.

And David blessed the Lord in the presence of all the congregation: and
David said, Blessed art thou, O Lord, the God of Israel our father, from
everlasting to everlasting. Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the
power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is
in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine, O Lord, is the kingdom,
and the supremacy as head over all. Riches

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

and honor come of thee, and thou rulest over all; and in thine hand are
might and power; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give
strength unto all. Now, therefore, our God, we give thanks unto thee,
and praise thy glorious name.

Nehemiah ix. 6–11.

Thou art the Lord, even thou alone; thou hast made the heavens, the
heaven of heavens, and all their host, the earth and all things that are
thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou givest life to them
all; and the host of heaven worship thee. Thou art the Lord the God, who
didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees,
and gavest him the name of Abraham: and foundest his heart faithful
before thee:

And thou madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite,
the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the
Girgashite, even to give it unto his seed, and hast performed thy words;
for thou art righteous. And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in
Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea; and shewedst signs and
wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of
his land; for thou knewest that they dealt arrogantly against them; and
didst make thee a name, as it is this day.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And thou didst
divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the
sea on the dry land; and their pursuers thou didst cast into the depths,
as a stone into the mighty waters.

Exod. xiv. 30–xv. 18.

Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians;
and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. And Israel saw the
great power which the Lord put forth against the Egyptians, and the
people feared the Lord: and they believed in the Lord, and in Moses his
servant.

Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and
spake, saying: I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath been highly
exalted: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. The Lord
is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: this is my God,
and I will glorify him; my father's God, and I will exalt him. The Lord
is a man of war: the Lord is his name. Pharaoh's chariots and his host
hath he cast into the sea: and his chosen captains are sunk in the Red
Sea. The floods cover them: they went down into the depths like a stone.
Thy right hand, O Lord, that is glorious in power, thy right hand, O
Lord, dasheth in pieces the enemy. And in the greatness of thy majesty
thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee: thou sendest forth thy
wrath, it consumeth them as stubble. And with the

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up, the streams stood
upright as an heap; the floods were congealed in the heart of the sea.
The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil:
my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand
shall destroy them. Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them:
they sank as lead in the mighty waters. Who is like unto thee, O Lord,
amongst the mighty ones: who is like unto thee, glorious in holiness,
revered in praises, doing marvels? Thou stretchedst out thy right hand,
the earth swallowed them. Thou in thy lovingkindness hast led the people
which thou hast redeemed: thou has guided them in thy strength to thy
holy habitation. The peoples have heard it; they tremble: pangs have
taken hold of the inhabitants of Philistia. Then were the dukes of Edom
confounded; the mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold of them: all
the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away. Terror and dread falleth upon
them: by the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone; till
thy people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over, which thou hast
acquired. Thou wilt bring them in, and plan them in the mountain of
thine inheritance, the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to
dwell in, the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established. The
Lord shall reign for ever and ever. The Lord shall reign for ever and
ever.

For the kingdom is the Lord's: and he is ruler over the nations. And
saviors shall come up

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

on mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the
Lord's. And the Lord shall be King over all the earth: in that day shall
the Lord be One, and his name One. And in thy Law it is written, saying,
Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One.

Praised be thy name for ever, O our King, the great and holy God and
King, in heaven and on earth; for unto thee, O Lord our God, and God of
our fathers, song and praise are becoming, hymn and psalm, strength and
dominion, victory, greatness and might, renown and glory, holiness and
sovereignty, blessings and thanksgivings from henceforth even for ever.
Blessed art thou, O Lord, God and King, great in praises, God of
thanksgivings, Lord of wonders, who makest choice of song and psalm, O
King and God, the life of all worlds.

*Reader*.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who formest
light and createst darkness, who makest peace and createst all things:

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

Who in mercy givest light to the earth and to them that dwell thereon
and in thy goodness renewest the creation every day continually. How
manifold are thy works, O Lord! In wisdom hast thou made them all: the
earth is full of thy possessions. O King, who alone wast exalted from
aforetime, praised, glorified and extolled from days of old; O
everlasting God, in thine abundant mercies, have mercy upon us, Lord of
our strength, Rock of our stronghold. Shield of our salvation, thou
Stronghold of ours!

The blessed God, great in knowledge, prepared and formed the rays of the
sun: it was a boon he produced as a glory to his name: he set the
luminaries round about his strength. The chiefs of his hosts are holy
beings that exalt the Almighty, and continually declare the glory of God
and his holiness. Be thou blessed, O Lord our God, for the excellency of
thy handiwork, and for the bright luminaries which thou hast made: they
shall glorify thee for ever.

Be thou blessed, O our Rock, our King and Redeemer, Creator of holy
beings, praised be thy name for ever, O our King; Creator of ministering
spirits, all of whom stand in the heights of the universe, and proclaim
with awe in unison aloud the words of the living God and everlasting
King. All of them are beloved, pure and mighty; and all of them in dread
and awe do the will of their Master; and all of

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

them open their mouths in holiness and purity, with song and psalm,
while they bless and praise, glorify and reverence, sanctify and ascribe
sovereignty to—

The name of the Divine King, the great, mighty and dreaded One, holy is
he; and they all take upon themselves the yoke of the kingdom of heaven
one from the other, and give sanction to one another to hallow their
Creator: in tranquil joy of spirit, with pure speech and holy melody
they all respond in unison, and exclaim with awe:

Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his
glory.

And the Ophanim and the holy Chayoth with a noise of great rushing,
upraising themselves towards the Seraphim, thus over against them offer
praise and say:

Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.

To the blessed God they offer pleasant melodies; to the King, the living
and ever-enduring God, they utter hymns and make their praises heard;
for he alone performeth mighty deeds, and maketh new things; he is the
Lord of battles; he soweth righteousness, causeth salvation to spring
forth, createth remedies, and is revered in praises. He is the Lord of
wonders, who in his goodness reneweth

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

the creation every day continually; as it is said, (O give thanks) to
him that maketh great lights, for his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
O cause a new light to shine upon Zion, and may we all be worthy soon to
enjoy its brightness. Blessed art thou, O Lord, Creator of the
luminaries.

With abounding love hast thou loved us, O Lord our God, with great and
exceeding pity hast thou pitied us. O our Father, our King, for our
fathers’ sake, who trusted in thee, and whom thou didst teach the
statutes of life, be also gracious unto us and teach us. O our Father,
merciful Father, ever compassionate, have mercy upon us; O put it into
our hearts to understand and to discern, to mark, learn and teach, to
heed, to do and to fulfil in love all the words of instruction in thy
Law. Enlighten our eyes in thy Law, and let our hearts cleave to thy
commandments, and unite our hearts to love and fear thy name, so that we
be never put to shame. Because we have trusted in thy holy, great and
revered name, we shall rejoice and he glad in thy salvation. O bring us
in peace from the four corners of the earth, and make us go upright to
our land; for thou art a God who worketh salvation. Thou hast chosen us
from all peoples and tongues, and hast brought us near unto thy great
name for ever

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

in faithfulness, that we might in love give thanks unto thee and
proclaim thy unity. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hast chosen thy people
Israel in love.

*When prayers are not said with the Congregation, add:—*

God, faithful King!

Deut. vi. 4–9.

Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One.

<span class="small">Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is for
ever and ever.</span>

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which. I command thee
this day, shall be upon thine heart: and thou shalt teach them
diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sit-test
in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest
down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. And thou
shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.

Deut. xi. 13–21.

And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my
commandments which I

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

command you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with
all your heart and. with all your soul, that I will give the rain of
your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou
mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. And I will give
grass in thy field for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied.
Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside,
and serve other gods, and worship them; and the anger of the Lord be
kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain,
and that the land yield not her fruit; and ye perish quickly from off
the good land which the Lord giveth you. Therefore shall ye lay up these
my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a
sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.
And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them when thou sittest
in

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down,
and when thou risest up. And thou shalt write them upon the door posts
of thine house, and upon thy gates: that your days may be multiplied,
and the days of your children, upon the land which the Lord sware unto
your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.

Numbers xv. 37–41.

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of
Israel, and bid them that they make them a fringe upon the corners of
their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the
fringe of each corner a cord of blue: and it shall be unto you for a
fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of
the Lord, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and
your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray: that ye may remember and
do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. I am the Lord your
God, who

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your
God.

True and firm, established and enduring, right and faithful, beloved and
precious, desirable and pleasant, revered and mighty, well-ordered and
acceptable, good and beautiful is this thy word unto us for ever and
ever. It is true, the God of the universe is our King, the Rock of
Jacob, the Shield of our salvation: thoughout all generations he
endureth and his name endureth; his throne is established, and his
kingdom and his faithfulness endure for ever. His words also live and
endure; they are faithful and desirable for ever and to all eternity, as
for our fathers so also for us, our children, our generations, and for
all the generations of the seed of Israel his servants.

For the first and for the last ages thy word is good and endureth for
ever and ever; it is true and trustworthy, a statute which shall not
pass away. True it is that thou art indeed the Lord our God, and the God
of our fathers, our King, our fathers’ King, our Redeemer, the Redeemer
of our fathers, our Maker, the Rock of our salvation; our Deliverer and
Rescuer from everlasting, such is thy name; there is no God beside thee.

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

Thou hast been the help of our fathers from of old, a Shield and Saviour
to their children after them in every generation: in the heights of the
universe is thy habitation, and thy judgments and thy righteousness
reach to the furthest ends of the earth. Happy is the man who hearkeneth
unto thy commandments, and layeth up thy Law and thy word in his heart.
True it is that thou art indeed the Lord of thy people, and a mighty
King to plead their cause. True it is that thou art indeed the first and
thou art the last, and beside thee we have no King, Redeemer and
Saviour. From Egypt thou didst redeem us, O Lord our God, and from the
house of bondmen thou didst deliver us; all their first born thou didst
slay, but thy first-born thou didst redeem; thou didst divide the Red
Sea, and drown the proud; but thou madest the beloved to pass through,
while the waters covered their adversaries, not one of whom was left.
Wherefore the beloved praised and extolled God, and offered hymns,
songs, praises, blessings and thanksgivings to the King and God, who
liveth and endureth; who is high and exalted, great and revered; who
bringeth low the haughty, and raiseth up the lowly, leadeth forth the
prisoners, delivereth the meek, helpeth the poor, and answereth his
people when they cry unto him; even praises to the Most High God,
blessed is he, and ever to be blessed. Moses and the children of Israel
sang a song unto thee with great joy, saying, all of them,

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the might ones? Who is like unto
thee, glorious in holiness revered in praises, doing marvels?

With a new song the redeemed people offered praise unto thy name at the
sea shore: they all gave thanks in unison, and proclaimed thy,
sovereignty, and said,

The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.

O Rock of Israel, arise to the help of Israel, and deliver, according to
thy promise, Judah and Israel. Our Redeemer, the Lord of hosts is his
name, the Holy One of Israel. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hast
redeemed Israel.

*The following prayer (Amidah) to "as in ancient years," [p.
66](#page_66.md) is to be said standing*.

<span class="small">O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall
declare thy praise.</span>

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham,
God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the great, mighty and revered God, the
most high God, who bestowest lovingkindnesses, and possessest all
things; who rememberest the pious deeds of the patriarchs, and in love
wilt bring a redeemer to their children's children for thy name's sake.

*During the Ten Days of Penitence say:—*

<span class="small">Remember us unto life, O King, who delightest in

Thou, O Lord, art mighty for ever, thou quickenest the dead, thou art
mighty to save,

*From the Eighth Day of Solemn Assembly until the First Day of Passover
say:—*

<span class="small">Thou causest the wind to blow and the rain to
fall</span>

Thou sustainest the living with lovingkindness, quickenest the dead with
great mercy, supportest the falling, healest the sick, loosest the
bound, and keepest thy faith to them that sleep in the dust. Who is like
unto thee, Lord of mighty acts, and who resembleth thee, O King, who
killest and quickenest, and causest salvation to spring forth?

*During the Ten Days of Penitence say:—*

<span class="small">Who is like unto thee, Father of mercy, who in mercy
rememberest thy creatures unto life?</span>

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

Yea, faithful art thou to quicken the dead. Blessed art thou, O Lord,
who quickenest the dead. \*

Thou art holy, and thy name is holy, and holy beings praise thee daily.
(Selah.) Blessed art thou, O Lord, the holy God.

*During the Ten Days of Penitence conclude the Blessing thus:—*

*When the Reader repeats the Amidah, the following is said, to "holy
God," [p. 56](#page_56.md)*.

\* Reader.—We will sanctify thy name in the world even as they sanctify
it in the highest heavens, as it is written by the hand of thy prophet:

of his glory.

Blessed art thou, O Lord, gracious Giver of knowledge.

Cause us to return, O our. Father, unto thy Law; draw us near, O our
King, unto thy service, and bring us back in perfect repentance unto thy
presence. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who delightest in repentance.

Forgive us, O our Father, for we have sinned; pardon us, O our King, for
we have transgressed;

*On Fast Days the Reader here says "Answer us," etc., [p. 61](#page_61.md),
and concludes thus—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord, who answerest in time of trouble.

Heal us, O Lord, and we shall be healed; save us and we shall be saved;
for thou art our praise. Vouchsafe a perfect healing to all our
wounds; <span id="fr_1"></span>[\*](#fn_1.md) for thou, almighty King, art

Sound the great horn for our freedom; lift up the ensign to gather our
exiles, and gather us from the four corners of the earth. Blessed art
thou, O Lord, who gatherest the banished ones of thy people Israel.

Restore our judges as at the first, and our counsellors as at the
beginning; remove from us grief and suffering; reign thou over us, O
Lord, thou alone, in lovingkindness and tender mercy, and justify us in
judgment. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the King who lovest righteousness
and judgment.

*During the Ten Days of Penitence conclude the Blessing thus:—*

<span class="small">the King of Judgment.</span>

And for slanderers let there be no hope, and let all wickedness perish
as in a moment; let all thine enemies be speedily cut off, and the
dominion of arrogance do thou uproot and crush,

breakest the enemies and humblest the arrogant.

trust in thy name; set our portion with them for ever, so that we may
not be put to shame; for we have trusted in thee. Blessed art thou, O
Lord, the stay and trust of the righteous.

And to Jerusalem, thy city, return in mercy, and dwell therein as thou
hast spoken; rebuild it soon in our days as an everlasting building, and
speedily set up therein the throne of David. <span

Jerusalem.

Speedily cause the offspring of David, thy servant, to flourish, and let
his horn be exalted by thy salvation, because we wait for thy salvation
all the day. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who causest the horn of salvation
to flourish.

Hear our voice, O Lord our God; spare us and have mercy upon us, and
accept our prayer in mercy and favor; for thou art a God who hearkenest
unto prayers and supplications:

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

of thy people Israel. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hearkenest unto
prayer.

Accept, O Lord our God, thy people Israel and their prayer; restore the
service to the oracle of thy house; receive in love and favor both the
fire-offerings of Israel and their prayer; and may the service of thy
people Israel be ever acceptable unto thee.

*On Chanukah and Purim the following is added:—*

<span class="small">In the days of the Hasmonean, Mattathias son of
Johanan, the High Priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous power of
Greece rose up against thy people Israel to make them forgetful of thy
Law, and to force them to transgress the statutes of thy will, then
didst thou in thine abundant mercy rise up for them in the time of their
trouble; thou didst plead their cause, thou didst judge their suit, thou
didst avenge their wrong; thou deliveredst the strong into the hands of
the weak, the many into the hands of the few, the impure into the hands
of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and the
arrogant into the hands of them that occupied themselves with thy Law:
for thyself thou didst make a great and holy name</span>

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

<span class="small">in thy world, and for thy people Israel thou didst
work a great deliverance and redemption as at this day. And thereupon
thy children came into the oracle of thy house, cleansed thy temple,
purified thy sanctuary, kindled lights in thy holy courts, and appointed
these eight days of Chanukah in order to give thanks and praises unto
thy great name.</span>

*On Purim*.

<span class="small">In the days of Mordecai and Esther, in Shushan the
capital, when the wicked Haman rose up against them, and sought to
destroy, to slay and make to perish all the Jews, both young and old,
little children and women, on one day, on the thirteenth day of the
twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them
for a prey,—then didst thou in thine abundant mercy bring his counsel to
nought, didst frustrate his design, and return his recompense upon his
own head; and they hanged him and his sons upon the gallows.</span>

For all these things thy name, O our King, shall be continually blessed
and exalted for ever and ever.

*During the Ten Days of Penitence say:—*

<span class="small">O inscribe all the children of thy covenant for a
happy life.</span>

And everything that liveth shall give thanks unto thee for ever, and
shall praise thy name in truth, O God, our salvation and our help.
Blessed art thou, O Lord, whose name is All-good, and unto whom it is
becoming to give thanks.

*At the repetition of the Amidah by the Reader, the following is
introduced:—*

<span class="small">Our God and God of our fathers, bless us with the
three-fold blessing of thy Law written by the hand of Moses thy servant,
which was spoken by Aaron and his sons, the priests, thy holy people, as
it is said, The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face
to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn his face
unto thee, and give thee peace.</span>

Grant peace, welfare, blessing, grace, loving kindness and mercy unto us
and unto all Israel, thy people. Bless us, O our Father, even all of us
together, with the light of thy countenance for by the light of thy
countenance thou hast given us, O Lord our God, the Law of life,
lovingkindness and righteousness, blessing, mercy, life and peace; and
may it be good in thy sight to bless thy people Israel at all times and
in every hour with thy peace.

*During the Ten Days of Penitence say:—*

<span class="small">In the book of life, blessing, peace and good
sustenance may we be remembered and inscribed before thee, we and all
thy people the house of Israel, for a happy life and for peace. Blessed
art thou, O Lord, who makest peace.</span>

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

Blessed art thou, O Lord, who blessest thy people Israel with peace.

O my God! guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile; and
to such as curse me let my soul be dumb, yea, let my soul. be unto all
as the dust. Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy
commandments. If any design evil against me, speedily make their counsel
of none effect, and frustrate their designs. Do it for the sake of thy
name, do it for the sake of thy right hand, do it for the sake of thy
holiness, do it for the sake of thy Law. In order that thy beloved ones
may be delivered, O save with thy right hand, and answer me. Let the
words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before
thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer. He who maketh peace in his high
places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel, and say ye, Amen.

May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the
temple be speedily rebuilt in our days, and grant our portion in thy
Law. And there we will serve thee with awe, as in the days of old, and
as in ancient years. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be
pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.

*In illness, or when time is lacking, the following shortened form of
the Amidah may be said:—*

"O Lord," [p. 53](#page_53), to "holy God," [p. 55](#page_55.md).

Give us understanding, O Lord our God, to know thy ways; circumcise our
hearts to fear thee, and forgive us so that we may be redeemed. Keep us
far from sorrow; satiate us on the pastures of thy land, and gather our
scattered ones from the four corners of the earth. Let them that go
astray be judged according to thy will, and wave thy hand over the
wicked. Let the righteous rejoice in the rebuilding of thy city, and in
the establishment of thy temple, and in the flourishing of the horn of
David thy servant, and in the clear-shining light of the son of Jesse,
thine anointed. Even before we call, do thou answer. Blessed art thou, O
Lord, who hearkenest unto prayer.

*On Mondays and Thursdays the following is said to "the Lord is One,"
[p. 76](#page_76.md). On other Week Days continue, "And David said," etc.,
[p. 76](#page_76.md). Both these Prayers are omitted on New Moon, during
the whole month of Nisan, on the thirty-third day of Counting the Omer,
from the first day of Sivan until the second day after Pentecost, on the
9th and 15th of Ab, on the day before New Year, from the day before the
Fast of Atonement until the second day after Tabernacles, on the Feast
of Dedication, on the 15th of Shebat, on the two days of Purim, and on
the two days of Purim Katon, the 14th and 15th of Adar Rishon. These
prayers are also omitted in the house of a mourner during the week of
mourning, and at the celebration of a circumcision*.

And he, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity and destroyeth not: yea, many
a time he turneth his anger away and cloth not stir up all his wrath.
Withhold

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

not thou thy tender mercies from us, O Lord: let thy lovingkindness and
thy truth continually preserve us. Save us, O Lord our God, and gather
us from amongst the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to
triumph in thy praise. If thou shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who
could stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
feared. Not according to our sins wilt thou deal with us, nor requite us
according to our iniquities. If our iniquities testify against us, work
thou, O Lord, for thy name's sake. Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies
and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old. May the Lord
answer us in the day of trouble, the name of the God of Jacob set us up
on high. Save, Lord: may the King answer us on the day when we call. Our
Father, our King, be gracious unto us and answer us, for we have no good
works of our own; deal with us in charity for thy name's sake. Our Lord,
our God, hearken to the voice of our supplications, and remember unto us
the covenant of our fathers, and save us for thy name's sake. And now, O
Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of
Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast made thee a name as at this day; we
have sinned, we have done wickedly. O Lord, according to all thy
righteous acts, let thine anger and thy fury, I pray thee, be turned
away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because for our sins
and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are
become a reproach to all that are round about us. Now therefore,
hearken, O our God, unto the prayer

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

of thy servant and to his supplications, and cause thy face to shine
upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.

Incline thine ear, O my God, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our
desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not lay
our supplications before thee because of our righteous acts, but because
of thine abundant mercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord forgive; O Lord, hearken
and do; defer not; for thine own sake, O my God, because thy city and
thy people are called by thy name. O our Father, merciful Father, show
us a sign for good, and gather our scattered ones from the four corners
of the earth. Let all the nations perceive and know that thou art the
Lord our God. And now, O Lord, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and
thou art our potter, yea, we are all the work of thy hand. Save us for
thy name's sake, our Rock, our King, and our Redeemer. Spare thy people,
O Lord, and give not thine inheritance over to reproach, that the
nations should make a by-word of them. Wherefore should they say among
the peoples, Where is their God? We know that we have sinned, and there
is none to stand up in our behalf; let thy great name stand for our
defence in time of trouble. We know that we have no good works of our
own; deal with us in charity for thy name's sake. As a father hath mercy
upon his children, so, O Lord, have mercy upon us, and save us for thy
name's sake. Have pity upon

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

thy people; have mercy upon thine inheritance; spare, we pray thee,
according to the abundance of thy tender mercies; be gracious unto us
and answer us, for charity is thine, O Lord; thou doest wondrous things
at all times.

Look, we beseech thee, and speedily have mercy upon thy people for thy
name's sake in thine abundant mercies. O Lord our God, spare and be
merciful; save the sheep of thy pasture; let not wrath rule over us, for
our eyes are bent upon thee; save us for thy name's sake. Have mercy
upon us for the sake of thy covenant; look, and answer us in time of
trouble, for salvation is thine, O Lord. Our hope is in thee, O God of
forgiveness. We beseech thee, forgive, O good and forgiving God, for
thou art a gracious and merciful God and King.

We beseech thee, O gracious and merciful King, remember and give heed to
the Covenant between the Pieces (with Abraham), and let the binding
(upon the altar) of (Isaac) an only son appear before thee, to the
welfare of Israel. Our Father, our King, be gracious unto us and answer
us, for we are called by thy great name. Thou who doest wondrous things
at all times, deal with us according to thy lovingkindness. O gracious
and merciful Being, look, and answer us in time of trouble, for
salvation is thine, O Lord. Our Father, our King, our Refuge, deal not
with us according to the evil of our doings; remember, O Lord, thy
tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; save us according to thy
abundant goodness, and have pity upon us, we beseech thee, for we have
no other God beside thee, our Rock.

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Forsake us not, O
Lord bur God, be not far from us; for our soul is shrunken by reason of
the sword and captivity and pestilence and plague, and of every trouble
and sorrow. Deliver us, for we hope in thee; put us not to shame, O Lord
our God; make thy countenance to shine upon us; remember unto us the
covenant of our fathers, and save us for thy name's sake. Look upon our
troubles, and hear the voice of our prayer, for thou hearest the prayer
of every mouth.

Merciful and gracious God! Have mercy upon us and upon all thy works,
for there is none like unto thee, O Lord our God. We beseech thee,
forgive our transgressions, O our Father, our King, our Rock and our
Redeemer, O living and everlasting God, mighty in strength, loving and
good to all thy works; for thou art the Lord our God. O God, who art
slow to anger and full of mercy, deal with us according to the abundance
of thy tender mercies, and save us for thy name's sake. Hear our prayer,
O our King, and deliver us from the hand of our enemies; hear our
prayer, O our King, and deliver us from all trouble and sorrow. Thou art
our Father, our King, and we are called by thy name; desert us not.
Forsake us not, our Father, and cast us not off, O our Creator, and
forget us not, O our Maker, for thou art a gracious and merciful God and
King.

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

There is none gracious and merciful like thee, O Lord our God; there is
none like thee, O God, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness and
truth. Save us in thine abundant mercies; from fierceness and rage
deliver us. Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; look not
unto our stubbornness and our wickedness and our sin. Turn from thy
fierce anger, and repent of the evil against thy people. Remove from us
the stroke of death, for thou art merciful, for such is thy way—showing
lovingkindness freely throughout all generations. Spare thy people, O
Lord, and deliver us from thy wrath, and remove from us the stroke of
the plague, and harsh decrees, for thou art the Guardian of Israel. Unto
thee, O Lord, belongeth righteousness, but unto us confusion of face.
How may we complain? What can we say, what can we speak, or how can we
justify ourselves? We will search our ways and try them, and turn again
to thee; for thy right hand is stretched out to receive the penitent.
Save, we beseech thee, O Lord; we beseech thee, O Lord, send prosperity.
We beseech thee, O Lord, answer us on the day when we call. For thee, O
Lord, we wait; for thee, O Lord, we hope; in thee, O Lord, we trust; be
not silent, nor let us be oppressed; for the nations say, Their hope is
lost. Let every knee and all that is lofty bow down to thee alone.

O thou, who openest thy hand to repentance, to receive transgressors and
sinners—our soul is sore vexed through the greatness of our grief;
forget us not for

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

ever; arise and save us, for we trust in thee. Our Father, our King,
though we be without righteousness and good deeds, remember unto us the
covenant of our fathers, and the testimony we bear every day that the
Lord is One. Look upon our affliction, for many are our griefs and the
sorrows of our heart. Have pity upon us, O Lord, in the land of our
captivity, and pour not out thy wrath upon us, for we are thy people,
the children of thy covenant. O God, look upon our sunken glory among
the nations, and the abomination in which we are held as of utter
defilement. How long shall thy strength remain in captivity, and thy
glory in the hand of the foe? Arouse thy might and thy zeal against
thine enemies, that they may be put to shame and broken down in their
might. O let not our travail seem little in thy sight. Let thy tender
mercies speedily come to meet us in the day of our trouble; and if not
for our sake, do it for thine own sake, and destroy not the remembrance
of our remnant; but be gracious unto a people, who in constant love
proclaim the unity of thy name twice every day, saying, Hear, O Israel:
the Lord our God, the Lord is One.

And David said unto Gad, I am troubled exceedingly; let us fall, I pray
thee, into the hand of the Lord, for his mercies are many; but let me
not fall into the hand of man.

O thou who art merciful and gracious, I have sinned before thee. O Lord,
full of mercy, have mercy upon me and receive my supplications.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

Psalm vi.

O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger: neither chasten me in thy hot
displeasure. Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for I am withered away: O
Lord, heal me; for my bones are troubled. My soul also is sore troubled:
and thou, O Lord, how long? Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: save me for
thy lovingkindness’ sake. For in death there is no remembrance of thee:
in the grave who shall give thee thanks? I am weary with my groaning;
every night I make my bed to swim; I melt away my couch with my tears.
Mine eye wasteth away because of grief it waxeth old because of all mine
adversaries. Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord
hath heard the voice of my weeping. The Lord hath heard my supplication;
the Lord will receive my prayer. All mine enemies shall be ashamed and
sore troubled: they shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly.

*On Monday and Thursday Mornings the following is added. On other
Weekdays, and in the Afternoon Service, continue "O Guardian of Israel,"
[p. 79](#page_79.md)*.

*Reader and Cong*.—O Lord God of Israel, turn from thy fierce wrath, and
repent of the evil against thy people.

*Cong*.—Look from heaven and see how we have become a scorn and a
derision among the nations;

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

we are accounted as sheep brought to the slaughter, to be slain and
destroyed, or to be smitten and reproached.

*Cong. and Reader*.—Yet, despite all this, we have not forgotten thy
name: we beseech thee, forget us not.

*Cong*.—Strangers say, There is no hope or expectancy for you. Be
gracious unto a people that trust in thy name. O thou who art most pure,
bring our salvation near. We are weary, and no rest is granted us. Let
thy tender mercies subdue thine anger from us.

*Cong. and Reader*.—We beseech thee, turn from thy wrath, and have mercy
upon the treasured people whom thou hast chosen.

*Cong*.—O Lord, spare us in thy tender mercies, and give us not into the
hands of the cruel. Wherefore should the nations say, Where now is their
God? For thine own sake deal kindly with us, and delay not.

*Cong. and Reader*.—We beseech thee, turn from thy wrath, and have mercy
upon the treasured people whom thou hast chosen.

*Cong*.—Hear our voice, and be gracious, and forsake us not in the hand
of our enemies to blot out our name; remember what thou hast sworn to
our fathers, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven:—and now
we are left a few out of many.

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

*Cong. and Reader*.—Yet, despite all this, we have not forgotten thy
name: we beseech thee, forget us not.

*Cong*.—Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of
thy name; and deliver us, and pardon our sins for thy name's sake.

*Cong. and Reader*.—O Lord God of Israel, turn from thy fierce wrath,
and repent of the evil against thy people.

O Guardian of Israel, guard the remnant of Israel, and suffer not Israel
to perish, who say, Hear O Israel.

O Guardian of an only nation, guard the remnant of an only nation, and
suffer not an only nation to perish, who proclaim the unity of thy name,
saying, The Lord our God, the Lord is One.

O Guardian of a holy nation, guard the remnant of a holy nation, and
suffer not a holy nation to perish, who thrice repeat the three-fold
sanctification unto the Holy One.

O Thou who art propitiated by prayers for mercy, and art conciliated by
supplications, be thou propitious and reconciled to an afflicted
generation; for there is none that helpeth.

Our Father, our King, be gracious unto us, and answer us, for we have no
good works of our own; deal with us in charity and lovingkindness, and
save us.

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon thee. Remember,
O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been
ever of old. Let thy lovingkindness, O Lord, be upon us, according as we
have waited for thee. Remember not against us the iniquities of our
ancestors: let thy tender mercies speedily come to meet us; for we are
brought very low. Be gracious unto us, O Lord, be gracious unto us; for
we are sated to the full with contempt. In wrath remember to be
merciful. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of thy name;
and deliver us, and pardon our sins, for thy name's sake.

*Reader*.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which
he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom
during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the
house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.

*Cong. and Reader*.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all
eternity.

*Reader*.—Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored,
magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though
he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations,
which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

*On Mondays and Thursdays the following two paragraphs are added. They
are, however, omitted on the following days:—New Moon, the day before
Passover, the Fast of Ab, the day before the Fast of Atonement, during
the Feast of Dedication, the two days of Purim, and of Purim Katon, the
14th and 15th of Adar Rishon*.

O God, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness and truth, rebuke
us not in thine anger. Have pity upon thy people, O Lord, and save us
from all evil. We have sinned against thee, O Lord: forgive, we beseech
thee, according to the abundance of thy tender mercies, O God.

O God, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness and truth, hide not
thy face from us. Have pity upon Israel, thy people, and deliver us from
all evil. We have sinned against thee, O Lord; forgive, we beseech thee,
according to the abundance of thy tender mercies, O God.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### ORDER OF READING THE LAW.

*The following to "as of old," [p. 87](#page_87.md), forms part of the
Service when Prayers are said with a Congregation on Mondays and
Thursdays, and also, with the exception of "May it be the will," etc.,
to "Amen," [p. 85](#page_85.md), on Sabbath Afternoons, New Moon, the
Intermediate Days of Passover and Tabernacles, and on Fast Days
(Mornings and Afternoons)*.

*The Ark is Opened*.

*Reader and Cong*.—And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that
Moses said, Rise

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

up, O Lord, and thine enemies shall be scattered, and they that hate
thee shall flee before thee. For out of Zion shall go forth the Law, and
the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

Blessed be he who in his holiness gave the Law to his people Israel.

*The Reader takes the Scroll of the Law, and says:—*

Magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.

*Reader and Cong*.—Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and
the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the
heaven and in the earth is thine; thine, O Lord, is the kingdom, and the
supremacy as head over all. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at
his footstool: holy is he. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his
holy mount; for the Lord our God is holy.

May the Father of mercy have mercy upon a people that have been borne by
him. May he remember the covenant with the patriarchs, deliver our souls
from evil hours, check the evil inclination in them that have been
carried by him, grant us of his grace an everlasting deliverance, and in
the attribute of his goodness fulfil our desires by salvation and mercy.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

*The Scroll of the Law is placed upon the desk. The Reader unrolls it,
and says the following:—*

And may his kingdom be soon revealed and made visible unto us, and may
he be gracious unto our remnant and unto the remnant of his people, the
house of Israel, granting them grace, kindness, mercy and favor; and let
us say, Amen. Ascribe, all of you, greatness unto our God, and render
honor to the Law.

*Here the Reader names the Person who is to be called to the Reading of
the Law*.

Blessed be he, who in his holiness gave the Law unto his people Israel.
The Law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul: the testimony of the
Lord is faithful, making wise the simple. The precepts of the Lord are
right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure,
enlightening the eyes. The Lord will give strength unto his people: the
Lord will bless his people with peace. As for God, his way is perfect:
the word of the Lord is tried: he is a shield unto all them that trust
in him.

*Cong. and Reader*.—And ye that cleave unto the Lord your God are alive
every one of you this day.

*Those who are called to the Reading of the Law say the following
Blessing:—*

Bless ye the Lord who is to be blessed.

*Cong*.—Blessed be the Lord, who is to be blessed for ever and ever.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

*The Response of the Congregation is repeated and the Blessing
continued:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast chosen
us from all peoples, and hast given us thy Law. Blessed art thou, O
Lord, who givest the Law.

*After the Reading of a Section of the Law, the following Blessing is
said:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast given
us the Law of truth, and hast planted everlasting life in our midst.
Blessed art thou, O Lord, who givest the Law.

*Persons who have been in peril of their lives, during journeys by sea
or land, in captivity or sickness, upon their deliverance or recovery
say the following, after the conclusion of the last Blessing:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who vouchsafest
benefits unto the undeserving, who hast also vouchsafed all good unto
me.

*The Congregation respond:—*

He who hath vouchsafed all good unto thee, may he vouchsafe all good
unto thee for ever.

*After the Reading of the Law, the Scroll is held up, and the
Congregation say the following:–*

And this is the Law which Moses set before the children of Israel,
according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses. It is a
tree of life to them that grasp it, and of them that uphold it every one
is rendered happy. Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths
are peace.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Length of days is
in its right hand; in its left hand are riches and honor. It pleased the
Lord, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Law and to make it
honorable.

*On those Mondays and Thursdays when the Prayers, pp. [70](#page_70.md) to
[81](#page_81.md), are said, the Reader adds the following, previous to the
Scroll of the Law being returned to the Ark:—*

May it be the will of our Father who is in heaven to establish the
Temple, the house of our life, and to restore his divine presence in our
midst, speedily in our days; and let us say, Amen.

May it be the will of our Father who is in heaven to have mercy upon us
and upon our remnant, and to keep destruction and the plague from us and
from all his people, the house of Israel; and let us say, Amen.

May it be the will of our Father who is in heaven to preserve among us
the wise men of Israel; them, their wives, their sons and daughters,
their disciples and the disciples of their disciples in all the places
of their habitation; and let us say, Amen.

May it be the will of our Father who is in heaven that good tidings of
salvation and comfort may be heard and published, and that he may gather
our banished ones from the four corners of the earth; and let us say,
Amen.

As for our brethren, the whole house of Israel, such of them as are
given over to trouble or captivity, whether they abide on the sea or on
the dry land,—may the All-present have mercy upon them, and bring them
forth from trouble to enlargement, from darkness to light, and from
subjection to redemption, now speedily and at a near time; and let us
say, Amen.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

*On returning the Scroll of the Law to the Ark, the Reader says:—*

Let them praise the name of the Lord; for his name alone is exalted:

*Congregation*.—His majesty is above the earth and heaven; and he hath
lifted up a horn for h, people, to the praise of all his loving ones,
even of the children of Israel, the people near unto him. Praise ye the
Lord.

Psalm xxiv.

A Psalm of David: The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; the
world, and they that dwell therein. For it is he that hath founded it
upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. Who may ascend the
mountain of the Lord? And who may stand in his holy place? He that hath
clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not set his desire upon vanity,
and hath not sworn deceitfully. He shall receive a blessing from the
Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. This is the
generation of them that seek after him, that seek thy face, (O God of)
Jacob! (Selah.) Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye
everlasting doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who, then, is the
King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty. the Lord mighty in battle.
Lift up your heads, O ye gates; yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors,
that the King of glory may come in. Who, then, is the King of glory? The
Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. (Selah.)

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

*While the Scroll of the Law is being placed in the Ark, the following
to "as of old" is said:—*

And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the ten thousands of
the thousands of Israel. Arise, O Lord, unto thy resting place; thou,
and the. ark of thy strength. Let thy priests be clothed with
righteousness; and let thy loving ones shout for joy. For the sake of
David thy servant, turn not away the face of thine anointed. For I give
you good doctrine; forsake ye not my Law. It is a tree of life to them
that grasp it, and of them that uphold it every one is rendered happy.
Its ways are ways of pleasantness, and all its paths are peace. Turn
thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall return: renew our days as of
old.

Happy are they that dwell in thy house: they will be ever praising thee.
(Selah.)

Happy is the people, that is in such a case: happy is the people, whose
God is the Lord.

Psalm cxlv. A Psalm of Praise: of David

I will extol thee, my God, O King; and I will bless thy name for ever
and ever.

Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and
ever.

Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised: and his greatness is
unsearchable.

One generation shall laud thy works to another, and shall declare thy
mighty acts.

On the majestic glory of thy grandeur, and on thy marvellous deeds, will
I meditate.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

And men shall speak of the might of thy awful acts; and I will recount
thy greatness.

They shall pour forth the fame of thy great goodness, and shall exult in
thy righteousness.

The Lord is gracious and merciful; slow to anger and of great
lovingkindness.

The Lord is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works.

All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O Lord; and thy loving ones
shall bless thee.

They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power.

To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the majestic glory
of his kingdom.

Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth
throughout all generations.

The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that are
bowed down.

The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their food in due
season.

Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest every living thing with favor.

The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and loving. in all his works.

The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him. to all that call upon
him in truth.

He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their
cry, and will save them.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

The Lord guardeth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he
destroy.

My mouth shall speak of the praise of the Lord; and let all flesh bless
his holy name for ever and ever.

But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for ever more.
Praise ye the Lord.

*On the following days Psalm xx. is omitted: New Moon, the day before
Passover, on the Fast of Ab, the day before the Fast of Atonement,
during the Feast of Dedication, on Purim and Purim Katon*.

Psalm xx.

For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The Lord answer thee in the
day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high; send
thee help from the sanctuary, and uphold thee out of Zion; remember all
thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice (Selah); grant thee thy
heart's desire, and fulfil all thy purpose. We will exult in thy
salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the
Lord fulfil all thy petitions. Now know I that the Lord saveth his
anointed; he will answer him from his holy heaven with the mighty saving
acts of his right hand. Some trust in chariots and some in horses: but
we will make mention of the name of the Lord our God. They are bowed
down and fallen: but we are risen and stand upright. Save, Lord: may the
King answer us on the day when we call.

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

And a redeemer shall come to Zion and to them that turn from
transgression in Jacob, saith the Lord. And as for me, this is my
covenant with them, saith the Lord: my spirit that is upon thee, and my
words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth,
nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's
seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.

But thou art holy, O thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel. And
one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts:
the whole earth is full of his glory.  <span
id="fr_6"></span>[\*](#fn_6.md)And they receive sanction the one from the
other, and say, Holy in the highest heavens, the place of his divine
abode; holy upon earth, the work of his might; holy for ever and to all
eternity is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of the radiance
of his glory. Then a wind lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice
of a great rushing (saying), Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his
place.  <span id="fr_7"></span>[\*](#fn_6.md)Then a wind lifted me up, and
I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, of those who uttered
praises, and said, Blessed be the glory of the Lord from the region of
his divine abode. The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.  <span
id="fr_8"></span>[\*](#fn_6.md)The kingdom of the Lord endureth for ever
and to all eternity. O Lord, the God of Abraham, of Isaac and of Israel,
our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of
the heart of thy people, and direct their heart unto thee. And he, being
merciful, forgiveth iniquity

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

and destroyeth not: yea, many a time he turneth his anger away, and doth
not stir up all his wrath. For thou, O Lord, art good and forgiving, and
abounding in lovingkindness to all them that call upon thee. Thy
righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy Law is truth.
Thou wilt show truth to Jacob and lovingkindness to Abraham, according
as thou has sworn unto our fathers from the days of old. Blessed be the
Lord day b, day; if one burdeneth us, God is our salvation. (Selah.) The
Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. (Selah.) O
Lord of hosts, happy is the man that trusteth in thee. Save, Lord: may
the King answer us on the day when we call. Messed is our God, who hath
created us for his glory, and hath separated us from them that go
astray, and hath given us the Law of truth and planted everlasting life
in our midst. May he open our heart unto his Law, and place his love and
fear within our hearts, that we may do his will and serve him with a
perfect heart, that we may not labor in vain, nor bring forth for
confusion. May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers,
that we may keep thy statutes in this world, and be worthy to live to
witness and inherit happiness and blessing in the days of the Messiah
and in the life of the world to come. To the end that my glory may sing
praise unto thee, and not be silent: O Lord my God, I will give thanks
unto thee for ever. Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and
whose trust the Lord is. Trust ye in the Lord for ever; for in Jah the
Lord is an everlasting rock

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; for thou hast
not forsaken them that seek thee, Lord. It pleased the Lord, for his
righteousness’ sake, to magnify the Law and to make it honorable.

*On the days when the Additional Service is said, the Reader here says
Half Kaddish, to "in the world; and say ye, Amen"; on other days, the
whole Kaddish, as follows:—*

And now, I pray thee, let the power of the Lord be great, according as
thou hast spoken. Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy
lovingkindness; for they have been ever of old.

*Reader*.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which
he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom
during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the
house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.

*Cong. and Reader*.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all
eternity.

*Reader*.—Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored,
magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though
he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations,
which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen.

*Cong*.—Accept our prayer in mercy and in favor.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

*Reader*.—May the prayers and supplications of all Israel be accepted by
their Father who is in heaven; and say ye, Amen.

*Cong*.—Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for
evermore.

*Reader*.—May there be abundant peace from heaven, and life for us and
for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.

*Cong*.—My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

*Reader*.—He who maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for
us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.

It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to
him who formed the world in the beginning, since he hath not made us
like the nations of other lands, and hath not placed us like other
families of the earth, since he hath not assigned unto us a portion as
unto them, nor a lot as unto all their multitude. For we bend the knee
and offer worship and thanks before the supreme King of kings, the Holy
One, blessed be he, who stretched forth the heavens and laid the
foundations of the earth, the seat of whose glory is in the heavens
above, and the abode of whose might is in the loftiest heights. He is
our God; there is none else an truth he is our King; there is none
besides him; as it is written in his Law, And thou shalt know this day,
and lay it to thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above and
upon the earth beneath: there is none else.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

We therefore hope in thee, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold
the glory of thy might, when thou wilt remove the abominations from the
earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be
perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty, and all the children of
flesh will call upon thy name, when thou wilt turn unto thyself all the
wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and
know that unto thee every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before
thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and unto thy glorious name
let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of thy kingdom, and do
thou reign over them speedily, and for ever and ever. For the kingdom is
thine, and to all eternity thou wilt reign in glory; as it is written in
thy Law, the Lord shall reign for ever and ever. And it is said, And the
Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall the Lord be
One, and his name One.

Comfort, O Lord our God, the mourners of Zion, and the mourners of
Jerusalem, and the city that <span id="page_60">p. 60</span> is in
mourning, laid waste, despised and desolate; in mourning for that she is
childless, laid waste as to her dwellings, despised in the downfall of
her glory, and desolate through the loss of her inhabitants: she sitteth
with her head covered like a barren woman who hath not borne. Legions
have devoured her; worshippers of strange gods have possessed her: they
have put thy people Israel to the sword, and in wilfulness have slain
the loving ones of the Most High. Therefore let Zion weep bitterly, and
Jerusalem give forth her voice. O my heart, my heart! how it grieveth
for the slain! My bowels, my bowels! how they yearn for the slain! For
thou, O Lord, didst consume her with fire; and with fire thou wilt in
future restore her, as it is said, As for me, I will be unto her, saith
the Lord, a wall of fire round about, and I will be a glory in the midst
of her. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who comfortest Zion and rebuildest
Jerusalem.

entreat thee, unto our cry; let thy lovingkindness be a comfort to us;
even before we call unto thee answer us, according as it is said, And it
shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; while they are
yet speaking, I will hear; for thou, O Lord, art he who answereth in
time of trouble, who delivereth and rescueth in all times of trouble and
distress; for thou hearkenest, etc.
