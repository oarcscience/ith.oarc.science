### SERVICE AT A CIRCUMCISION

*Upon the arrival of the Child who is to be initiated into the Covenant
of Abraham, those Present at the Ceremony rise and say:—*

Blessed be he that cometh.

*The Father of the Child says:—*

I am here ready to perform the affirmative precept to circumcise my son,
even as the Creator, blessed be he, hath commanded us, as it is written
in the Law, And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among
you, every male throughout your generations.

*The Mohel takes the child, and, placing it upon a seat, says:—*

This is the throne of Elijah:—may he be remembered for good!

For thy salvation I have waited, O Lord. I have hoped, O Lord, for thy
salvation; and have done thy commandments. I have hoped for thy
salvation, O Lord. I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great
spoil. Great peace have they who love thy Law; and there is no stumbling
for them. Happy is he whom thou choosest, and causest to approach that
he may dwell in thy courts.

*Those present respond:—*

O let us be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, thy holy temple.

*The Mohel places the Child upon the knees of the Godfather, and before
performing the Circumcision says the following Blessing:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast given us command concerning
the Circumcision.

*Immediately after the Circumcision the Father says the following
Blessing:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast commanded us to make our
sons enter into the covenant of Abraham our father.

*Those present respond:—*

Even as he has entered into the covenant, so may he enter into the Law,
the nuptial canopy, and into good deeds.

*The Mohel continues:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who createst the
fruit of the vine.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who from the
womb didst sanctify Isaac the well-beloved didst set thy statute in his
flesh, and seal his offspring with the sign of the holy covenant. On
this account, O living God. our Portion and our Rock, give command to
deliver from destruction the dearly beloved of our flesh, for the sake
of the covenant thou hast set in our bodies. Blessed art thou, O Lord,
who makest the covenant.

Our God and God of our fathers, preserve this child to his father and to
his mother, and let his name be called in Israel — the son of —. Let the
father rejoice in him that came forth from his loins, and the mother be
glad with the fruit of her womb; as it is written, Let thy father and
thy mother rejoice, and let her that bare thee be glad: and it is said,
And I passed by thee, and I saw thee weltering in thy blood, and I said
unto thee, In thy blood live. Yea, I said onto thee, In thy blood live.
And it is said, He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which
he commanded to a thousand generations; (the covenant) which he made
with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac, and confirmed the same unto Jacob
for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant And it is said, And
Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had
commmanded him. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for his
lovingkindness endureth for ever. This little child —, may he become
great. Even as he has entered into the covenant, so may he enter into
the Law, the nuptial canopy, and into good deeds.

*The Godfather drinks of the Wine; a few drops are given to the Infant,
and the Cup of Blessing being Text to the Mother, she also partakes
thereof*.
