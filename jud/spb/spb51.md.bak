### SERVICE FOR THE REDEMPTION OF THE FIRST-BORN

*The first-born Child, if a male, must be redeemed on the thirty-first
day of his birth. If, however, the Father be a Cohen or a Levite, or the
Mother the daughter of a Cohen or a Levite, they are exempt from the
duty of Redemption. Should the thirty-first day fall on a Sabbath or
Holyday, the ceremony is postponed until the day following*.

*The Father, presenting his Child to the Cohen, makes the following
declaration:—*

This my first-born son is the first-born of his mother, and the Holy
One, blessed be he, hath given command to redeem him, as it is said, And
those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou
redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels,
after the shekel of the sanctuary, the shekel being twenty gerahs; and
it is said, Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the
womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.

*The Father then places before the Cohen silver to the amount of five
selaim or shekels (four dollars), and the Cohen asks:—*

Which wouldst thou rather, give me thy first-born son, the first-born of
his mother, or redeem him for five selaim, which thou art bound to give
according to the Law?

*The Father replies:—*

I desire rather to redeem my son, and here thou hast the value of his
redemption, which I am bound to give according to the Law.

*The Cohen receives the redemption money, and returns the Child to his
Father, whereupon the latter says the following Blessing:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
sanctified us by thy commandments, and given us command concerning the
redemption of the son.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast kept us
in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season.

*The Cohen then takes the redemption money, and, holding it over the
head of the Child, says:—*

This is instead of that, this in commutation for that, this in remission
of that. May this child enter into life, into the Law and the fear of
Heaven. May it be God's will that even as he has been admitted to
redemption, so may he enter into the Law, the nuptial canopy, and into
good deeds. Amen.

*The Cohen places his hand upon the head of the Child, and pronounces
the following Benediction:—*

God make thee as Ephraim and Manasseh. The Lord bless thee, and keep
thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
thee: the Lord turn his face unto thee, and give thee peace.

The Lord is thy guardian: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. For
length of days, and years of life and peace shall they add to thee. The
Lord shall guard thee from all evil; he shall guard thy soul. Amen.
