<p>May the All-merciful restore the service of the temple to its place. May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the temple be speedily rebuilt in our days, and grant our portion in thy Law. And there we will serve thee with awe, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.</p>  
<p align="center">Psalm lxvii., <A HREF="spb24.htm#page_299">p. 299</A>.</p>  
<p>We beseech thee, release thy captive nation by the mighty strength of thy right hand. Accept the joyful chant of thy people, lift us and purify us, O revered God. O thou mighty One, guard as the apple of thine eye them that meditate upon thy unity. Bless them, purify them, have mercy upon them, ever vouchsafe thy righteousness unto them. O powerful and holy Being, in thine abounding goodness lead thy congregation. Turn, thou who art the only and exalted God, unto thy people, who are mindful of thy holiness. Accept our prayer and hearken unto our cry, thou who knowest all secrets. Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever.</p>
