<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who removest sleep from mine eyes, and slumber from mine eyelids.</p>  
<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast given us the Law of truth, and hast planted everlasting life in our midst.</p>  
<p>Moses commanded us the Law as an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.</p>  
<p>Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One, Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever.</p>  
<p>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</p>  
<p>And these words which I command thee this day shall be upon thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house and upon thy gates.</p>  
<p>O my God, guard my tongue from evil, and my lips from speaking guile.</p>  
<p>Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy commandments.</p>  
<p>Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.</p>
