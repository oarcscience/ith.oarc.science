<p>I acknowledge unto thee, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, that both my cure and my death are in thy hands. May it be thy will to send me a perfect healing. Yet if my death be fully determined by thee, I will in love accept it at thy hand. O may my death be an atonement for all the sins, iniquities and transgressions of which I have been guilty against thee, Vouchsafe unto me of the bounding happiness that is treasured up for the righteous. Make known to me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.</p>  
<p>Thou who art the father of the fatherless and judge of the widow, protect my beloved kindred with whose soul my own is knit. Into thy hand I commend my spirit; thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth, Amen, and Amen!</p>  
<p align="center"><i>When the end is approaching:&#8212;</i></p>  
<p>The Lord reigneth; the Lord hath reigned; the Lord shall reign for ever and ever. (<i>To be said three times</i>.)</p>  
<p>Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever. (<i>To be said three times</i>.)</p>  
<p>The Lord he is God. (<i>To be said seven times</i>.)</p>  
<p>Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one.</p>
