### CONFESSION ON A DEATH-BED

I acknowledge unto thee, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, that both
my cure and my death are in thy hands. May it be thy will to send me a
perfect healing. Yet if my death be fully determined by thee, I will in
love accept it at thy hand. O may my death be an atonement for all the
sins, iniquities and transgressions of which I have been guilty against
thee, Vouchsafe unto me of the bounding happiness that is treasured up
for the righteous. Make known to me the path of life: in thy presence is
fulness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.

Thou who art the father of the fatherless and judge of the widow,
protect my beloved kindred with whose soul my own is knit. Into thy hand
I commend my spirit; thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth, Amen,
and Amen!

*When the end is approaching:—*

The Lord reigneth; the Lord hath reigned; the Lord shall reign for ever
and ever. (*To be said three times*.)

Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever. (*To
be said three times*.)

The Lord he is God. (*To be said seven times*.)

Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
