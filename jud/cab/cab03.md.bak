### CHAPTER I.

### NAME AND ORIGIN OF THE CABALA.

**The Cabala**.--By Cabala we understand that system of religious
philosophy, or more properly, of Jewish theosophy, which played so
important a part in the theological and exegetical literature of both
Jews and Christians ever since the Middle Ages.

The Hebrew word Cabala (from Kibbel) properly denotes "reception," then
"a doctrine received by oral tradition." The term is thus in itself
nearly equivalent to "transmission, like the Latin *traditio*, in Hebrew
*masorah*, for which last, indeed, the Talmud makes it interchangeable
in the statement given in Pirke Abot I, 1: "Moses received (*kibbel*)
the Law on Mount Sinai, and transmitted (*umsarah*) it to Joshua." The
difference, however, between the word "Cabala" and the cognate term
masorah is that the former expressed "the act of receiving," while the
latter denotes "the act of giving over, surrendering, transmitting." The
name, therefore,

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

tells us no more than that this theosophy has been received
traditionally. In the oldest Jewish literature (Mishna, Midrash,
Talmud), the Cabala denotes the whole body of Jewish tradition. The name
is even applied to the prophetic writings of the Old Testament, and the
Hagiographa, in contradistinction to the Pentateuch. As a scientific
system the Cabala is also called *chokmat ha-cabalah*, i.e., science of
tradition, or *chokmah nistarah* (abbreviated *ch’n*, i.e., *chen*,
‏חן‎), i.e., secret science or wisdom, and its representatives and
adherents delighted in calling themselves; *maskilim*, i.e.,
"intelligent," or with a play of words *yodé ch’n*, i.e., "connoisseurs
of secret wisdom."

Having defined the term Cabala, which was still commonly used for "oral
tradition" in the 13th and 14th centuries even after the technical sense
of the word was established, we must be careful to distinguish between
cabala and mysticism. Like other Eastern nations, the Jews were
naturally inclined to theosophical speculation and though this tendency
may have been repressed by the definite teaching of revelation as long
as they were confined within the sacred boundaries of Palestine, it
found a freer scope after the Exile.

There were two subjects about which the Jewish imagination especially
busied itself,--the

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

history of the Creation, and the *Merkabah*, or the Divine apparition to
Ezekiel. Both touch the question of God's original connection with His
creatures, and that of His continued intercourse with them. They treat
of the mystery of nature and of Providence, especially of Revelation;
and an attempt is made to answer the question, how the Infinite God can
have any connection or intercourse with finite creatures.

It is difficult to say how far it is possible to trace with certainty
Jewish mysticism. Even in the book of Sirach (Ecclus, xlix. 8) it is the
special praise of Ezekiel that he saw the chariot of the Cherubim. When
we come to the period of the Mishna, we find the existence of a body of
esoteric doctrine already presupposed. It is laid down that "no one
ought to discourse the history of Creation (Gen. i) with two, or the
Chariot (Ezek. i) with one, unless he be a scholar, who has knowledge of
his own" (Chagiga II, 1) .

Further allusions to these mysterious doctrines occur in the Talmud, but
any rash investigation of them was discouraged, as is shown by the story
of the four sages in "the enclosed garden," i.e., who were engaged in
theosophical studies. One of them, it was said, had looked around and
died; another had looked around and lost his reason; a third eventually
tried to destroy the

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

garden; <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) while the fourth alone had
entered and returned in safety (Chagiga, fol. 14, col. 2).

Little by little mysticism made its way from Palestine into Babylonia
and found many followers. Its adepts called themselves "Men of Faith."
They boasted of possessing the means of obtaining a view of the divine
household. By virtue of certain incantations, invocations of the names
of God and the angels, and the recitation of certain prayer-like chants,
combined with fasting and an ascetic mode of living, they pretended to
be able to perform supernatural deeds. For this purpose they made use of
amulets and cameos (*Kameoth*), and wrote upon them the names of God and
the angels with certain signs. Miracle-working was a trifle to these
mystics. The books which they wrote only gave hints, and only those were
initiated into the mystic secrets, in whose hand and forehead the adepts
pretended to discover lines that proved them to be worthy of being
initiated.

**Origin of the Cabala**.--Deferring until later

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

the works belonging to this period, we will now speak of the origin of
the Cabala. Although the name "Cabala" in its pregnant meaning is first
used in the 13th century, yet Jewish tradition claims a high antiquity
for the Cabala and traces it back, among others, to three famous
Talmudists, as the proper founders of the Cabala, viz., Rabbi Ismaël ben
Elisa (about 121 A. D.); Nechunjah Ben-Ha-Kanah (about 70 A. D.), and
especially Simon ben Jochaï (about 150 A. D.), <span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md) the reputed author of the Zohar.

Whatever may be the claims of these traditions they must be rejected.
The mystical speculations of the Cabala are entirely foreign to older
Judaism, especially original Mosaism. It is true that the Talmud
contains many things concerning God, heaven, hell, world, magic,
etc., <span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md) but these things were generally
assigned to some individuals, and are elements derived from Parsism and
neo-Platonism; and much as the Talmud and Midrash may otherwise speak of
the three teachers mentioned before, such things are not recorded of
them. The Cabala as a mystical system and its development as such
undoubtedly belongs to the Middle Ages, beginning probably with the
seventh century of our era, and culminating

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

in the Book Zohar. A fuller and more mature development of the Cabala is
due to the speculations of later masters.

The origin of the Cabala belongs to that period in which Judaism on the
one hand was permeated by a crude anthropomorphic notion of the Deity,
whereas on the other hand Platonism and Aristotelianism strove for the
ascendency in formulating the fundamental doctrines of Jewish belief.
With Moses Maimonides (1135-1204) rationalism had reached its climax.
The injunctions of the Bible were only to be explained by the light of
reason. Only the simple, primary or literary sense (*peshat*) of the
Scripture was recognized, the existing allegorical interpretation
(*derúsh*) was considered either as rabbinical fancy, or one saw in it
only a poetical form. Even the Talmud had been systematized and
codified. Religion had become a more or less meaningless *opus
operatum*. Philosophy had always been treated as something secondary,
which had nothing to do with practical Judaism, as it is daily and
hourly practiced. Maimonides, on the other hand, had introduced it into
the holiest place in Judaism, and, as it were, gave Aristotle a place
next to the doctors of the Law. Instead of unifying Judaism, Maimonides
caused a division, and the Maimunists and Anti-Maimunists opposed each
other. A reaction came and the

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cabala stepped in
as a counterpoise to the growing shallowness of the Maimunists'
philosophy. The storm against his system broke out in Provence and
spread over Spain. The latter country may be considered as the real home
of the Cabala. When the Jews were driven from that country, the Cabala
took root in Palestine and thence it was carried back into the different
countries of Europe.

The fundamental ideas of the Cabala are un-Jewish, derived from Philo,
the neo-Platonists and the neo-Pythagoreans; we sometimes even notice
Gnostic influences. But the close amalgamation of these different
elements with Biblical and Midrashic ideas has given to these foreign
parts such a Jewish coloring, that at the first glance they appear as an
emanation of the Jewish mental life.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[12:1](cab03.htm#fr_1.md) In the Talmud he is called
Elisha ben-Abuja, surnamed Acher, i.e., "the other one," after his
apostasy from Judaism. It is related of him that while attending the
Jewish college he had often been noticed to carry with him writings of
the "Minim" (probably of Gnostics), and that he had even been in the
habit of quoting Greek poetry. Elisha was a pupil of the famous rabbi
Akiba; comp. Jellinek, *Elisha ben-Abujja, genannt Acker*, Leipsic,
