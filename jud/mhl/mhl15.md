"*The King of the Khazars, a man of piety and fervent devotion to his

but not his actions*."

### THE BOOK CUSARI

#### (INTRODUCTION)

THE book Cusari was written by the famous poet Judah Halevi, whose life
and poetical works were presented in the preceding section. Halevi was
evidently impelled to write this prose poem, the Cusari, by his
religious faith. It is an imaginary dialogue between wise men of various
religions, in which the Jewish speaker triumphs. The discussion takes
place in the court of the King of the Cusars, or Khazars, a people about
whom medieval legend told an interesting tale. They lived far inland in
Asia and, having no established religion of their own, they resolved to
investigate all religions and select the best. After much consideration
they selected the Jewish religion and remained faithful to it for
centuries, until finally their nation was destroyed by the advance of
the Tartar hordes. This legend forms the basis of Halevi's book, a
wholly imaginary discourse, from which we reprint the celebrated central
portion, the argument of the wise men.
