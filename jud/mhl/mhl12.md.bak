# POEMS OF IBN GEBIROL

### O SOUL, WITH STORMS BESET!

O soul, with storms beset!  
Thy griefs and cares forget.  
Why dread earth's transient woe,  
When soon thy body in the grave unseen  
Shall be laid low,  
And all will be forgotten then, as though  
It had not been?

Wherefore, my soul, be still!  
Adore God's holy will,  
Fear death's supreme decree.  
Thus mayest thou save thyself, and win high aid  
To profit thee,  
When thou, returning to thy lord, shalt see  
Thy deeds repaid.

Why muse, O troubled soul,  
O'er life's poor earthly goal?  
When thou hast fled, the clay  
Lies mute, nor bear'st thou aught of wealth, or might  
With thee that day,  
But, like a bird, unto thy nest away,  
Thou wilt take flight.

Why for a land lament  
In which a lifetime spent  
Is as a hurried breath?  
Where splendor turns to gloom, and honors show  
A faded wreath,  
Where health and healing soon must sink beneath  
The fatal bow?

What seemeth good and fair  
Is often falsehood there.  
Gold melts like shifting sands,  
Thy hoarded riches pass to other men  
And strangers' hands,  
And what will all thy treasured wealth and lands  
Avail thee then?

Life is a vine, whose crown  
The reaper Death cuts down.  
His ever-watchful eyes  
Mark every step until night's shadows fall,  
And swiftly flies  
The passing day, and ah! how distant lies  
The goal of all.

Therefore, rebellious soul,  
Thy base desires control;  
With scantly given bread  
Content thyself, nor let thy memory stray  
To splendors fled,  
But call to mind affliction's weight, and dread  
The judgment-day.

Prostrate and humbled go,  
Like to the dove laid low,  
Remember evermore  
The peace of heaven, the Lord's eternal rest.  
When burdened sore  
With sorrow's load, at every step implore  
His succor blest.

Before God's mercy-seat  
His pardoning love entreat.  
Make pure thy thoughts from sin,  
And bring a contrite heart as sacrifice  
His grace to win--  
Then will his angels come and lead thee in  
To Paradise.

### THE LAND OF PEACE

Whose works, O Lord, like thine can be,  
Who 'neath thy throne of grace,  
For those pure souls from earth set free,  
Hast made a dwelling-place?

There are the sinless spirits bound,  
Up in the bond of life,  
The weary there new strength have found,  
The weak have rest from strife.

Sweet peace and calm their spirits bless,  
Who reach that heavenly home,  
And never-ending pleasantness--  
Such is the world to come.

There glorious visions manifold  
Those happy ones delight,  
And in God's presence they behold  
Themselves and him aright.

In the King's palace they abide,  
And at his table eat,  
With kingly dainties satisfied,  
Spiritual food most sweet.

This is the rest forever sure,  
This is the heritage,  
Whose goodness and whose bliss endure  
Unchanged from age to age.

This is the land the spirit knows  
That everlastingly  
With milk and honey overflows  
And such its fruit shall be.
