##### The Sacred Books and Early Literature of the East, Vol. IV

# Medieval Hebrew

### *featuring* THE MIDRASH

#### \[1917\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an an etext of an early 20th Century anthology of translations
of Medieval Hebrew religious texts. This is of interest because of the
(abridged) translations of some Midrash texts, of which there are few
public domain translations. This also contains a fascinating Middle East
travelogue by a Jewish traveller in the 12th Century C.E., which also
has an informal census of the Jewish population in various areas. This
etext omits the section of the original book on the Kabbalah, which
simply repeats an abridged copy of the material in The Kabbalah
Unveiled, a complete etext of which can be found [here](../tku/index)

Update! (1/24/2003) I've finally tracked down and posted the source of
the unattributed Midrash extracts in this anthology: see [Tales and
Maxims from the Midrash](../tmm/index).
