### BENJAMIN OF TUDELA

#### HEBREW PREFACE

This book contains the reports of Rabbi Benjamin, the son of Jonah, of
blessed memory, <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) of Tudela, in the
kingdom of Navarre. This man traveled through many and distant
countries, as related in the following account, and took down in writing
in each place what he saw or what was told him by men of integrity,
whose names were known in Spain. Rabbi Benjamin also mentions some of
the principal men in the places he visited; and when he returned, he
brought this report along with him to the country of Castile in the year
933 (A.D. 1173). The above-mentioned Rabbi Benjamin was a man of wisdom
and understanding, and of much information; and after strict inquiry his
words were found to be true and correct, for he was a true man.

#### TRAVELS OF RABBI BENJAMIN, OF BLESSED MEMORY

Thus says Rabbi Benjamin, son of Jonah, of blessed

memory. I first set out from the city of Saragossa, and proceeded down
the river Ebro to Tortosa. Two days' journey

brought me to the ancient city of Tarragona, which contains

many cyclopean and pelasgic remains, <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_17.md)
and similar buildings are found nowhere else in the whole kingdom of
Spain.

This city stands on the coast. Two days thence is Barcelona, in which
place there is a congregation of wise, learned,

and princely men, such as R. Shesheth, R. Shealthiel, and R. Solomon,
son of R. Abraham, son of Chisdai, of blessed memory.

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

The city is handsome, though small, and is situated on the seashore. Its
trade attracts merchants from all parts of the world: from Greece, from
Pisa, Genoa, and Sicily, from Alexandria in Egypt, from Palestine and
the adjacent countries.

A day's journey and a half brings you to Gerona, which city contains a
small congregation of Jews. From thence it is three days to Narbonne,
eminent for its university, from which the study of the law spreads over
all countries. The city contains many wise and noble men, especially R.
Calonymos, son of the great and noble R. Theodoros, of blessed memory, a
descendant of the house of David, as proved by his pedigree. This man
holds landed property from the sovereigns of the country, and nobody can
deprive him of it by force. There is also R. Abraham, the president of
the university, R. Makhir, R. Juda, and others of much merit and
learning. Altogether the number of Jews amounts to about three hundred.
It is four parasangs thence to the city of Beziers, which contains a
congregation of learned men, the principals of which are R. Solomon
Chalaphtha and R. Joseph, son of R. Nathaniel, of blessed memory.

From thence it is two days to Har Gáash, or Montpellier, a city
conveniently situated for trade, being within two parasangs from the
coast. You here meet with Christian and Mohammedan merchants from all
parts: from Algarve (Portugal), Lombardy, the Roman Empire, Egypt,
Palestine, Greece, France, Spain, and England. People of all tongues
meet here, chiefly in consequence of the traffic of the Genoese and
Pisans. The Jews of this city are among the wisest and most esteemed of
the present generation. R. Reuben, son of Theodoros, R. Nathan, son of
Zacharias, R. Samuel, their rabbi, R. Shelemiah, and R. Mordecai, of
blessed memory, are the principal among them. Others are very rich, and
benevolent toward all who apply to them for assistance. It is four
parasangs hence to Lunel, a city containing also a holy congregation of
Jews, who employ all their time upon the study of the law. This town is
the place of residence of the celebrated rabbi R. Meshullam and his five

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

sons (R. Joseph, R. Isaac, R. Jacob, R. Aron, and R. Asher), all of whom
are eminent scholars and rich men. The latter is an ascetic, who does
not attend to any worldly business, but studies day and night, keeps
fasts, and never eats meat. He possesses an extraordinary degree of
knowledge of everything relating to Talmudic learning. R. Moses, his
brother-in-law, R. Samuel, the minister, R. Solomon Cohen, and the
physician R. Juda, son of Thibbon, of Spanish origin, are also
inhabitants of Lunel. All foreign students who resort hither to study
the law are supplied with food and raiment at the public expense during
the whole time of their stay in the university. The Jews of this city,
amounting to about three hundred, are wise, holy, and benevolent men,
who support their poor brethren near and far. The town stands within two
parasangs of the coast. It is two parasangs hence to Beaucaire, a large
town, containing about four hundred Jews, and a great university under
the presidency of the great rabbi, R. Abraham, son of David, of blessed
memory, a scholar of the first eminence in scriptural and Talmudic
learning. He attracts students from distant countries, Who are lodged in
his own house and are taught by him; he, moreover, provides them with
all necessaries of life from his own means and private property, which
is very considerable. R. Joseph, son of R. Menachem, R. Benbenast, R.
Benjamin, R. Abraham, and R. Isaac, son of R. Moses of blessed memory,
of this city, are also very great scholars and wise men. It is three
parasangs farther to Nogres or Bourg de St. Gilles. The chief of the
Jewish inhabitants, of which there are about one hundred, are R. Isaac,
son of R. Jacob, R. Abraham, son of R. Juda, R. Eliasar, R. Isaac, R.
Moses, and R. Jacob, son of the late rabbi R. Levi, of blessed memory.
This town is a place of pilgrimage, visited by the inhabitants of
distant countries and islands. It is situated within three parasangs of
the sea, on the very banks of the large river Rhone, which traverses the
whole of Provence. It is the place of residence of R. Abba Mari, son of
R. Isaac, of blessed memory, who holds the office of steward to count
Raymond.

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

To Arles, three parasangs. The chief of its two hundred Israelites are
R. Moses, R. Tobi, R. Isaiah, R. Solomon the rabbi, R. Nathan, and R.
Abba Mari, of blessed memory. It is three days hence to Marseilles, a
city containing many eminent and wise men. Its three hundred Jews form
two congregations, one of which resides in the lower town on the shore
of the Mediterranean, and the other in the upper part, near the
fortress. The latter supports a great university and boasts of many
learned scholars. R. Simeon, son of R. Antoli, his brother, R. Jacob,
and R. Levaro, are the chief of the upper synagogue, R. Jacob Perpiano,
a rich man, R. Abraham, and his son-in-law, R. Meir, R. Isaac, and
another Meir, preside over the lower congregation. An extensive trade is
carried on in this city, which stands immediately on the coast. And here
people take ship for Genoa, which also stands on the coast, and is
reached in about four days. Two Jews from Ceuta, R. Samuel, son of
Khilam, and his brother, reside there. The city is surrounded by a wall;
no king governs over it, but senators chosen by the citizens out of
their own body. Every house is provided with a tower, and in times of
civil commotion war is carried on from the tops of these towers. The
Genoese are masters of the sea, and build vessels called galleys, by
means of which they carry on war in many places and bring home much
plunder and booty. They are now at war with the Pisans.

From their city it is a distance of two days' journey to Pisa, which is
a place of very great extent, containing about ten thousand fortified
houses, from which war is carried on in times of civil commotion. All
the inhabitants are brave; no king or prince governs over them, the
supreme authority being vested in senators chosen by the people. The
principal of the twenty Jews resident at Pisa are R. Moses, R. Chaim,
and R. Joseph. The city has no walls, and stands about four miles from
the sea, the navigation being carried on by means of vessels which ply
upon the Arno, a river that runs through the city. Hence it is four
parasangs to Lucca, a large city, which contains about forty Jews, the
principal of whom are R. David, R. Samuel, and R. Jacob.

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

A journey of six days from thence brings you to the large city of Rome,
the metropolis of all Christendom. Two hundred Jews live there, who are
very much respected, and pay tribute to no one. Some of them are
officers in the service of pope Alexander. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[3](#fn_18.md) who is the chief ecclesiastic and head of
the Christian church. The principal of the many eminent Jews resident
here are R. Daniel and R. Jechiel. The latter is one of the pope's
officers, a handsome, prudent, and wise man, who frequents the pope's
palace, being the steward of his household and minister of his private
property. R. Jechiel is a descendant of R. Nathan, the author of the
book Aruch, and its comments. <span id="fr_22"></span>[4](#fn_19.md)There
are likewise at Rome, R. Joab, son of the rabbi R. Solomon, R. Menachem,
the president of the university, R. Jechiel, who resides in Trastevere,
and R. Benjamin, son of R. Shabthai, of blessed memory.

The city of Rome is divided into two parts by the river Tiber, which
runs through it. In the first of these divisions you see the large place
of worship called St. Peter of Rome, on the site of the extensive palace
of Julius Cæsar. The city contains numerous buildings and structures
entirely different from all other buildings upon the face of the earth.
The extent of ground covered by the ruined and inhabited parts of Rome
amounts to four-and-twenty miles. You there find eighty halls of the
eighty eminent kings who were all called Imperator, from King Tarquin to
King Pepin, the father of Charles (Charlemagne), who first conquered
Spain and wrested it from the Mohammedans. <span
id="fr_23"></span>[5](#fn_20.md) In the outskirts of Rome. is the palace of
Titus, who was rejected by three hundred senators in consequence of his
having wasted three years in the conquest of Jerusalem, which, according
to their will,

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

he ought to have accomplished in two years. There is likewise the hall
of the palace of King Vespasianus, a very large and strong building;
also the hall of King Galba, containing 360 windows, equal in number to
the days of the year. The circumference of this palace is nearly three
miles. A battle was fought here in times of yore, and in the palace fell
more than a hundred thousand, whose bones are hung up there even to the
present day. The King caused a representation of the battle to be drawn,
army against army, the men, the horses, and all their accoutrements
being sculptured in marble, in order to preserve a memorial of the wars
of antiquity. You there find also a cave under ground containing the
King and his Queen upon their thrones, surrounded by about one hundred
nobles of their court, all embalmed by physicians and in good
preservation to this day.

Another remarkable object is St. Giovanni *in porta Latina*, in which
place of worship there are two copper pillars constructed by King
Solomon, of blessed memory, whose name, "Solomon, son of David," is
engraved upon each. The Jews in Rome told Benjamin, that every year,
about the time of the 9th of Ab, <span id="fr_24"></span>[6](#fn_21.md)
these pillars sweat so much that the water runs down from them. You
there see also the cave in which Titus, the son of Vespasian, hid the
vessels of the temple, which he brought from Jerusalem; and in another
cave on the banks of the Tiber, you find the sepulchers of those holy
men of blessed memory, the ten martyrs of the kingdom. <span
id="fr_25"></span>[7](#fn_22.md) Opposite St. Giovanni de Laterano, there
is a statue of Samson, with a

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

lance of stone in his hand; also that of Absalom, the son of David, and
of King Constantine, who built Constantinople, which city is called
after his name; his statue is cast in copper, the man and horse being
gilt. Rome contains many other remarkable buildings and works, the whole
of which nobody can enumerate. . . .

 

It is one day hence to Acre, the Acco of Scripture, on the confines of
the tribe of Asher. It is the frontier town of Palestine; and, in
consequence of its situation on the shore of the Mediterranean and of
its large port, it is the principal place of disembarkation of all
pilgrims who visit Jerusalem by sea. A river called Kishon <span
id="fr_26"></span>[8](#fn_23.md) runs near the city. There are here about
two hundred Jewish inhabitants, of whom R. Zadok, R. Jepheth, and R.
Jona are the principal. Three parasangs farther is Kaiffa, which is Gath
Hachepher. <span id="fr_27"></span>[9](#fn_24.md) One side of this city is
situated on the coast, on the other it is overlooked by Mount Carmel.
Under the mountain are many Jewish sepulchers, and near the summit is
the cavern of Elijah, upon whom be peace. Two Christians have built a
place of worship near this site, which they call St. Elias. On the
summit of the hill you may still trace the site of the altar which was
rebuilt by Elijah, of blessed memory, in the time of King Ahab, and the
circumference of which is about four yards. The river Makattua runs down
the mountain and along its base. It is four parasangs hence to Khephar
Thanchum, which is Capernaum, identical with Meon, the place of abode of
Nabal the Carmelite. Six parasangs brings us to Cesarea, the Gath of the
Philistines of Scripture, inhabited by about ten Jews and two hundred
Cutheans. The latter are Samaritan Jews, commonly called Samaritans.
This city is very elegant and beautiful, situated on the seashore, and
was built by King Herod, who called it Cesarea in honor of the emperor,
or Cæsar. To Kakun, the Keilah of Scripture, half a day's journey; in
this place are no Jews. To St. George, the ancient Luz, half a day's
journey. One

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

Jew only, a dyer, lives here. To Sebaste, one day's journey. This is the
ancient Shomron, where you may still trace the site of the palace of
Ahab, King of Israel. It was formerly a very strong city, and is
situated on a mount, in a fine country, richly watered, and surrounded
with gardens, orchards, vineyards, and olive-groves. No Jews live here.

It is two parasangs farther to Nablous, the ancient Sichem, on Mount
Ephraim. This place contains no Jewish inhabitants, and is situated in
the valley between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. It is the abode of
about one hundred Cutheans, who observe the Mosaic law only, and are
called Samaritans. They have priests, descendants of Aaron the priest,
of blessed memory, whom they call Aaronim. These do not intermarry with
any other but priestly families; but they are priests only of their own
law, who offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings in their synagogue on
Mount Gerizim. They do this in accordance with the words of Scripture,
"Thou shalt put the blessing on Mount Gerizim," and they pretend that
this is the holy temple. <span id="fr_28"></span>[10](#fn_25.md) On
passover and holidays they offer burnt-offerings on the altar which they
have erected on Mount Gerizim, from the stones put up by the children of
Israel after they had crossed the Jordan. They pretend to be of the
tribe of Ephraim, and are in possession of the tomb of Joseph the
righteous, the son of our father Jacob, upon whom be peace, as is proved
by the following passage of Scripture, "The bones of Joseph, which the
children of Israel brought up with them from Egypt, they buried in
Sichem." The Samaritans do not possess the three letters *He*, *Cheth*,
and *Ain*; the *He* of the name of our father Abraham, and they have no
glory; the *Cheth* of the name of our father Isaac, in consequence of
which they are devoid of piety; the *Ain* of the name of Jacob, for they
want humility. Instead of these letters, they always put an *Aleph*, by
which you may know that they are not of Jewish origin, because, in their
knowledge of the law of Moses, they are deficient in

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

three letters. <span id="fr_29"></span>[11](#fn_26.md) This sect carefully
avoids being defiled by touching corpses, bones, those killed by
accident, or graves; and they change their daily garments whenever they
visit their synagogue, upon which occasion they wash their body and put
on other clothes. These are their daily habits.

Mount Gerizim is rich in wells and orchards, whereas Mount Ebal is dry
like stone and rock. The city of Nablous lies in the valley between
these two hills. Four parasangs from thence is situated Mount Gilboa,
which Christians call Monto Jelbon. The country in this part is very
barren. Five parasangs farther is the valley of Ajalon, called by the
Christians Val de Luna. One parasang to Gran David, formerly the large
city of Gibeon. It contains no Jewish inhabitants.

From thence it is three parasangs to Jerusalem, a small city strongly
fortified with three walls. It contains a numerous population, composed
of Jacobites, Armenians, Greeks, Georgians, Franks, and indeed of people
of all tongues. The dyeing-house is rented by the year, and the
exclusive privilege of dyeing is purchased from the king by the Jews of
Jerusalem, two hundred of whom dwell in one corner of the city, under
the tower of David. About ten yards of the base of this building are
very ancient, having been constructed by our ancestors; the remaining
part was added by the Mohammedans. The city contains no building
stronger than the tower of David. There are at Jerusalem two hospitals,
which support four hundred knights, and afford shelter to the sick;
these are provided with everything they may want, both during life and
in death; the second is called the hospital of Solomon, being the palace
originally built by King Solomon. This hospital also harbors and
furnishes four hundred knights, <span id="fr_30"></span>[12](#fn_27.md) who
are ever ready to wage war, over and above those knights who arrive from
the country of the Franks and other parts of Christendom. These
generally have taken a vow upon themselves to stay a year or

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

two, and they remain until the period of their vow is expired. The large
place of worship, called Sepulcher, and containing the sepulcher of that
man, <span id="fr_31"></span>[13](#fn_28.md) is visited by all pilgrims.

Jerusalem has four gates, called the gates of Abraham, David, Sion, and
Jehoshaphat. The latter stands opposite the place of the holy temple,
which is occupied at present by a building called Templo Domino. Omar
Ben Al-Khataab erected a large and handsome cupola over it, and nobody
is allowed to introduce any image or painting into this place, it being
set aside for prayers only. In front of it you see the western wall, one
of the walls which formed the Holy of Holies of the ancient temple; it
is called the Gate of Mercy, and all Jews resort thither to say their
prayers near the wall of the court-yard. At Jerusalem you also see the
stables erected by Solomon, and which formed part of his house. Immense
stones have been employed in this fabric, the like of which are nowhere
else to be met with. You further see to this day vestiges of the canal
near which the sacrifices were slaughtered in ancient times; and all
Jews inscribe their name upon an adjacent wall. If you leave the city by
the gate of Jehoshaphat, you may see the pillar erected on Absalom's
place, and the sepulcher of King Uzziah, and the great spring of
Shiloah, which runs into the brook Kedron. Over this spring is a large
building erected in the times of our forefathers. Very little water is
found at Jerusalem; the inhabitants generally drink rain-water, which
they collect in their houses.

From the Valley of Jehoshaphat the traveler immediately ascends the
Mount of Olives, as this valley only intervenes between the city and the
mount. From hence the Dead Sea is distinctly visible. Two parasangs from
the sea stands the salt pillar into which Lot's wife was metamorphosed;
and although the sheep continually lick it, the pillar grows again, and
retains its original state. You also have a prospect over the whole
valley of the Dead Sea, and of the brook of Shittim, even as far as
Mount Nebo. Mount Sion is also near Jerusalem, upon the acclivity of
which stands no building except

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

a place of worship of the Nazarenes (Christians). The traveler further
sees there three Jewish cemeteries, where formerly the dead were buried;
some of the sepulchers had stones with inscriptions upon them, but the
Christians destroy these monuments, and use the stones in building their
houses.

Jerusalem is surrounded by high mountains. On Mount Sion are the
sepulchers of the house of David, and those of the kings who reigned
after him. In consequence of the following circumstance, however, this
place is at present hardly to be recognized. Fifteen years ago, one of
the walls of the place of worship on Mount Sion fell down, and the
patriarch commanded the priest to repair it. He ordered stones to be
taken from the original wall of Sion for that purpose, and twenty
workmen were hired at stated wages, who broke stones from the very
foundation of the walls of Sion. Two of these laborers, who were
intimate friends, upon a certain day treated one another, and repaired
to their work after their friendly meal. The overseer accused them of
dilatoriness, but they answered that they would still perform their
day's work, and would employ thereupon the time while their fellow
laborers were at meals. They then continued to break out stones, until,
happening to meet with one which formed the mouth of a cavern, they
agreed to enter it in search of treasure, and they proceeded until they
reached a large hall, supported by pillars of marble, encrusted with
gold and silver, and before which stood a table, with a golden scepter
and crown. This was the sepulcher of David, King of Israel, to the left
of which they saw that of Solomon in a similar state, and so on the
sepulchers of all the kings of Juda, who were buried there. They further
saw chests locked up, the contents of which nobody knew, and were on the
point of entering the hall, when a blast of wind like a storm issued
forth from the mouth of the cavern so strong that it threw them down
almost lifeless on the ground. There they lay until evening, when
another wind rushed forth, from which they heard a voice like that of a
man calling aloud, "Get up, and go forth from this place." The men
rushed out full of fear, and proceeded to the patriarch to report what
had happened

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

to them. This ecclesiastic summoned into his presence R. Abraham el
Constantini, a pious ascetic, one of the mourners of the downfall of
Jerusalem, <span id="fr_32"></span>[14](#fn_29.md) and caused the two
laborers to repeat what they had previously reported. R. Abraham
thereupon informed the patriarch that they had discovered the sepulchers
of the house of David and of the kings of Juda. The following morning
the laborers were sent for again, but they were found stretched on their
beds and still full of fear; they declared that they would not attempt
to go again to the cave, as it was not God's will to discover it to any
one. The patriarch ordered the place to be walled up, so as to hide it
effectually from every one unto the present day. The above-mentioned R.
Abraham told me all this.

Two parasangs from Jerusalem is Bethlehem of Judea, called Beth-lehem;
and within half a mile of it, where several roads meet, stands the
monument which points out the grave of Rachel. This monument is
constructed of eleven stones, equal to the number of the children of
Jacob. It is covered by a cupola, which rests upon four pillars; and
every Jew who passes there inscribes his name on the stones of the
monument. Twelve Jews, dyers by profession, <span
id="fr_33"></span>[15](#fn_30.md) live at Bethlehem. The country abounds
with rivulets, wells, and springs of water. Six parasangs farther is
Hebron. The ancient city of that name was situated on the bill, and lies
in ruins at present; whereas the modern town stands in the valley,

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

even in the field of Machpelah. Here is the large place of worship
called St. Abraham, which during the time of the Mohammedans was a
synagogue. The Gentiles have erected six sepulchers in this place, which
they pretend to be those of Abraham and Sarah, of Isaac and Rebecca, and
of Jacob and Leah; the pilgrims are told that they are the sepulchers of
the fathers, and money is extorted from them. But if any Jew come, who
gives an additional fee to the keeper of the cave, an iron door is
opened, which dates from the times of our forefathers who rest in peace,
and with a burning candle in his bands the visitor descends into a first
cave, which is empty, traverses a second in the same state, and at last
reaches a third, which contains six sepulchers, those of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, and of Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah, one opposite the other. All
these sepulchers bear inscriptions, the letters being engraved: thus,
upon that of Abraham, we read, "This is the sepulcher of our father
Abraham, upon whom be peace"; and so on that of Isaac and upon all the
other sepulchers. A lamp burns in the cave and upon the sepulchers
continually, both night and day; and you there see tubs filled with the
bones of Israelites, for unto this day it is a custom of the house of
Israel to bring thither the bones of their relicts and of their
forefathers, and to leave them there. On the confines of the field of
Machpelah stands the house of our father Abraham, <span
id="fr_34"></span>[16](#fn_31.md) who rests in peace; before which house
there is a spring, and, out of respect to Abraham, nobody is allowed to
construct any building on that site.

It is five parasangs hence to Beit Jaberim, the ancient Mareshah, <span
id="fr_35"></span>[17](#fn_32.md) where there are but three Jewish
inhabitants. Five parasangs farther bring us to Toron de los Caballeros,
which is Shunem, inhabited by three hundred Jews. We then proceed three
parasangs to St. Samuel of Shiloh, the ancient Shiloh, within two
parasangs of Jerusalem. When

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

the Christians took Ramleh, which is Ramah, from the Mohammedans, they
discovered the sepulcher of Samuel the Ramathi near the Jewish
synagogue, and removed his remains to Shiloh, where they erected a large
place of worship over them, called St. Samuel of Shiloh to the present
day. Hence it is three parasangs to Pesipua, which is Gibeah of Saul, or
Geba of Benjamin; it contains no Jews. Three parasangs to Beith Nubi,
which is Nob, the city of the priests. In the middle of the road are the
two rocks of Jonathan, <span id="fr_36"></span>[18](#fn_33.md) the name of
one of which is Botsets, and of the other Séné. The two Jews who live
here are dyers.

It is three Parasangs hence to Ramleh, which is Harama, where you still
find walls erected by our forefathers, as is evident from the
inscriptions upon the stones. The city contains about three Jews; but it
was formerly very considerable, for a Jewish cemetery in its vicinity is
two miles in extent. Five parasangs hence to Jaffa, the Japho of
Scripture, on the coast; one Jew only, a dyer by profession, lives here.
Three parasangs to Ibelin, the ancient Jabneh, where the site of the
schools may still be traced; it contains no Jews. Here was the frontier
of the tribe of Ephraim. Two parasangs to Palmis, or Asdoud, <span
id="fr_37"></span>[19](#fn_34.md) formerly a city of the Philistines, at
present in ruins, and containing no Jews. Two parasangs to Ascalon,
which is in fact the New Ascalon, built on the coast by Esra the priest,
of blessed memory, and originally called Benebra, distant about four
parasangs from ancient Ascalon, which lies in ruins. This city is very
large and handsome; and merchants from all parts resort to it, on
account of its convenient situation on the confines of Egypt. There are
here about two hundred rabbanite Jews, of whom the principal are R.
Tsemach, R. Aaron, and R. Solomon, besides about forty Caraites, and
about three hundred Cutheans or Samaritans. In the city is a fountain
called Bir Ibrabim-al-Khahil,

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

which was dug in the time of the Philistines. From hence back to St.
George, which is Lydda, and in one day and a half to Serain, the Jezreel
of Scripture, <span id="fr_38"></span>[20](#fn_35.md) a city containing a
remarkably large fountain. It has one Jewish inhabitant, a dyer. Three
parasangs to Sufurieh, the Tsippori of antiquity. The sepulchers of
Rabenu Hakkadosh, of R. Chija, who came back from Babylon, and of Jonah
the son of Amittai the prophet, are shown here; they are buried in the
mountain, which also contains numerous other sepulchers.

From hence it is five parasangs to Tiberias, a city situated on the
Jordan, which here bears the name of the Sea of Chinnereth, or Lake of
Tiberias. Here are the falls of the Jordan, in consequence of which the
place bears also the name of Ashdoth-Pisga, which means "the place where
the rapid rivers have their fall": the Jordan afterward empties itself
into Lake Asphaltes, or the Dead Sea. Tiberias contains about fifty
Jews, the principal of whom are R. Abraham the astronomer,  <span
id="fr_39"></span>[21](#fn_36.md) R. Muchthar, and R. Isaac. The hot
waters, which spout forth from under ground, are called the warm baths
of Tiberias. In the vicinity is the synagogue of Khaleb, son of Jepuneh;
and among numerous other Jewish sepulchers are those of R. Jochanan, son
of Zakhai, <span id="fr_40"></span>[22](#fn_37.md) and of R. Jonathan, son
of Levi. These are all in Lower Galilee. Two parasangs bring us to
Tebnin, the Thimnatha of Scripture, <span id="fr_41"></span>[23](#fn_38.md)
where you find the sepulcher of Samuel (Simeon) the

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

Just, and many other sepulchers of Israelites. It is hence one day to
Gish, which is Gush Chaleb, and contains about twenty Jewish
inhabitants. We go hence six parasangs to Meroon, which is Maron; <span
id="fr_42"></span>[24](#fn_39.md) in a cave near this place are the
sepulchers of Hillel and Shamai, and of twenty of their disciples, as
well as those of R. Benjamin, son of Jephet, and of R. Juda, son of
Bethera. Six parasangs to Alma, which contains fifty Jewish inhabitants,
and a large cemetery of the Israelites. Half a day brings you to Kades,
which is Kadesh Naphthali, on the banks of the Jordan. Here are the
sepulchers of R. Eleasar, son of Arach, of R. Eleasar, son of Asariah,
of Chuni Hamaagal, of R. Simeon, son of Gamaliel, of R. Jose Hagelili,
and of Barak the son of Abinoam. <span id="fr_43"></span>[25](#fn_40.md)
This place contains no Jews.

A day's journey brings us to Belinas, <span
id="fr_44"></span>[26](#fn_41.md) the ancient Dan <span
id="fr_45"></span>[27](#fn_42.md) where the traveler may see a cave, from
which the Jordan issues, and three miles hence this river unites its
waters with those of the Arnon, a rivulet of the ancient land of Moab.
In front of the cave you may still trace vestiges of the altar of the
image of Micha, which was adored by the children of

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

Dan in ancient times. Here also is the site of the altar erected by
Jeroboam, son of Nebat, in honor of the golden calf; and here were the
confines of the land of Israel toward the uttermost sea. <span
id="fr_46"></span>[28](#fn_43.md)

Two days from this place brings you to Damascus, a large city and the
frontier town of the empire of Noureddin, <span
id="fr_47"></span>[29](#fn_44.md) King of the Thogarmim, or Turks. This
city is very large and handsome, and is enclosed with a wall and
surrounded by a beautiful country, which in a circuit of fifteen miles
presents the richest gardens and orchards, in such numbers and beauty as
to be without equal upon earth. The rivers Amana and Parpar, the sources
of which are on Mount Hermon (on which the city leans), run down here;
the Amana follows its course through Damascus, and its waters are
carried by means of pipes into the houses of the principal inhabitants,
as well as into the streets and markets. A considerable trade is carried
on here by merchants of all countries. The Parpar runs between the
gardens and orchards in the outskirts, and supplies them copiously with
water. Damascus contains a Mohammedan mosque, called "the Synagogue of
Damascus," a building of unequaled magnificence. They say that it was
the palace of Ben-Hadad, and that one wall of it is framed of glass by
enchantment. This wall contains as many openings as there are days in
the solar year, and the sun in gradual succession throws its light into
the openings, which are divided into twelve degrees, equal to the number
of the hours of the day, so that by this contrivance everybody may know
what time it is. The palace contains vessels richly ornamented with gold
and silver, formed like tubs, and of a size to allow three persons to
bathe in them at once. In this building is also preserved the rib of a
giant, which measures nine spans in length, and two in breadth, and
which belonged to an ancient giant king named Abchamas, whose name was
found engraved upon a stone of his tomb,

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

and it was further stated in the inscription that he reigned over the
whole world.

This city contains three thousand Jews, many of whom are learned and
rich men; it is the residence of the president of the university of
Palestine, named R. Esra, whose brother, Sar Shalom, is the principal of
the Jewish court of law. The other distinguished Jews are R. Joseph, who
ranges fifth in the university, R. Matsliach, the lecturer and master of
the schools, R. Meir, a flower of the learned, R. Joseph Ibn Pilath, who
may be called the prop of the university, R. Heman the elder, and R.
Zadok the physician. The city contains also two hundred Caraites and
about four hundred Samaritans, sects which here live upon friendly
terms, but they do not intermarry.

It is one day's journey thence to Jelaad, which is Gilead; it contains
about sixty Jews, the principal of whom is R. Zadok. The city is large,
well watered, and surrounded by gardens and orchards. Half a day's
journey farther stands Salkhat, the city of Salcah of Scripture. From
thence to Baalbec is half a day's journey. This is the city mentioned in
Scripture as Baalath in the valley of Lebanon, which Solomon built for
the daughter of Pharaoh. The palace is constructed of stones of enormous
size, measuring twenty spans in length and twelve in breadth; no binding
material holds these stones together, and people pretend that the
building could have been erected only by the help of Ashmodai. A copious
spring takes its rise at the upper side of the city, through which its
waters rush like those of a considerable river. They are employed in the
working of several mills within the city, which also encloses numerous
gardens and orchards.

Tadmor in the desert was also built by Solomon of equally large stones;
this city is surrounded by a wall, and stands in the desert, far from
any inhabited place, being four days' journey distant from the
above-mentioned Baalath. It contains two thousand warlike Jews, who are
at war with the Christians and with the Arabian subjects of Noureddin,
and assist their neighbors the Mohammedans. Their chiefs are

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

R. Isaac Hajevani, R. Nathan, and R. Usiel. Half a day brings us to
Cariyatin, which is Kirjathaim; one Jew only, a dyer by profession,
lives there. One day hence is Hamah, the Hamath of Scripture, on the
Orontes, under Mount Lebanon. Some time ago this city was visited by an
earthquake, in consequence of which fifteen thousand men died in one
day, leaving only seventy survivors. <span
id="fr_48"></span>[30](#fn_45.md) The principals of the Jews here are R.
Ulah Hacohen, the sheikh Abu al Galeb, and Muktar. Half a day to Reiha,
which is Hazor. Three parasangs to Lamdin, from whence it is a journey
of two days to Aleppo, the Aram Zoba of Scripture. This city is the
residence of King Noureddin, and contains his palace, a building
fortified by an extraordinarily high wall. There being neither spring
nor river, the inhabitants are obliged to drink rain-water, which is
collected in every house in a cistern called in Arabic, *Algub*. The
principal of the fifteen hundred Jews who live in Aleppo are R. Moses
el-Coustandini, R. Israel, and R. Seth.

To Bales, which is Pethor <span id="fr_49"></span>[31](#fn_46.md) on the
Euphrates, two days. Even at this day you there still find remains of
the tower of Balaam the son of Beor (may the name of the wicked rot!)
which he built in accordance with the hours of the day. This place
contains about ten Jews. Half a day hence we come to Kala Jiaber, <span
id="fr_50"></span>[32](#fn_47.md) which is Sela Midbarah. This city
remained in the power of the Arabs even at the time when the Thogarmim
(or Turks) took their country and dispersed them in the desert. It
contains about two thousand Jews, of

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

whom R. Zedekiah, R. Chia, and R. Solomon are the principal. One day
brings us to Racca, which is Calneh of Scripture, <span
id="fr_51"></span>[33](#fn_48.md) on the confines of Mesopotamia, being the
frontier town between that country and the empire of the Thogarmim (or
Turks); it contains about seven hundred Jewish inhabitants, the
principal of whom are R. Sakhai, R. Nadib, who is blind, and R. Joseph.
One of the synagogues was built by Esra the scribe, when he returned to
Jerusalem from Babylon. It is one day hence to the ancient place of
Haran, <span id="fr_52"></span>[34](#fn_49.md) which contains twenty Jewish
inhabitants, who also possess a synagogue erected by Esra. Nobody is
allowed to construct any building on the spot where the house of our
father Abraham was situated; even the Mohammedans pay respect to the
place, and resort thither to pray. Two days' journey from thence is . .
.  <span id="fr_53"></span>[35](#fn_50.md) at the mouth of the El-Khabur,
the Habor of Scripture. This river takes its course through Media, and
loses itself in the Kizil Ozein. About two hundred Jews dwell near this
place. Two days to Nisibin, a large city plentifully watered, and
containing about one thousand Jews. Two days to Jezireh ben Omar, an
island in the Tigris, at the foot of Mount Ararat, <span
id="fr_54"></span>[36](#fn_51.md) and four miles distant from the spot
where the ark of Noah rested; Omar Ben al-Khatab removed the ark from
the summit of the two mountains and made a mosque of it. There still
exists in the vicinity of the ark a synagogue of Esra the scribe, which
is visited by the Jews of the city on the 9th of Ah. The city of Jezireh
Omar Ben al-Khatab contains about four thousand

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

Jews, the principals of whom are R. Mubchar, R. Joseph, and R. Chiia.

Two days from thence stands Mosul, mentioned in Scripture as Ashur the
great, which contains about seven thousand Jews, the principal of whom
are R. Sakhai, the prince, a descendant of King David, and R. Joseph,
surnamed Borhan-al-Phulkh, who is astronomer of Seifeddin, the brother
of Noureddin, King of Damascus. This city, situated on the confines of
Persia, is of great extent and very ancient; it stands on the banks of
the Tigris, and is joined by a bridge to Nineveh. Although the latter
lies in ruins, there are numerous inhabited villages and small towns on
its site. Nineveh is on the Tigris, distant one parasang from the town
of Arbil. <span id="fr_55"></span>[37](#fn_52.md) Mosul contains the
synagogues of Obadiah, of Jonah, son of Amittai, and of Nahum the
Elkoshite. It is three days hence to Rahabah, which is Rehoboth, by the
river Euphrates, and contains about two thousand Jews, the principal of
whom are R. Ezekiah, R. Ehud, and R. Isaac. The city is surrounded by a
wall, it is very handsome, large, and well fortified; and the environs
abound with gardens and orchards. One day to Karkisia, <span
id="fr_56"></span>[38](#fn_53.md) the Carchemish of Scripture, on the banks
of the Euphrates, containing about five hundred Jewish inhabitants, of
whom the principal are R. Isaac and R. Elchanan. Two days to Juba, which
is Pumbeditba, in Nehardea; it contains about two thousand Jews, some of
them eminent scholars. R. Chen, R. Moses, and R. Eliakim are the
principal. Here the traveler may see the sepulchers of R. Juda and R.
Samuel, opposite two synagogues which they erected during their lives;
as well as the sepulchers of R. Bosthenai, the prince of the captivity,
of R. Nathan, and of R. Nachman, the son of Papa. <span
id="fr_57"></span>[39](#fn_54) Five days to Hardah (or Hadrah.md),
containing fifteen thousand Jews, of whom R. Saken, R. Joseph, and R.
Nathaniel are the principal. Two days to Akbara, the city which was
built by Jeconiah, King of Juda; it contains about ten thousand

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

Jews, the principal of whom are R. Joshua and R. Nathan.

Two days from thence stands Bagdad, the large metropolis of the Calif
Emir-al-Mumenin al Abassi, of the family of their prophet, who is the
chief of the Mohammedan religion. <span id="fr_58"></span>[40](#fn_55.md)
All Mohammedan kings acknowledge him, and he holds the same dignity over
them which the pope enjoys over the Christians. The palace of the Calif
at Bagdad is three miles in extent. It contains a large park filled with
all sorts of trees, both useful and ornamental, and all kinds of beasts,
as well as a pond of water carried thither from the river Tigris; and
whenever the Calif desires to enjoy himself and to sport and carouse,
birds, beasts, and fishes are prepared for him and for his courtiers,
whom he invites to his palace. This great Abasside is extremely friendly
toward the Jews, many of his officers being of that nation; he
understands all languages, is well versed in the Mosaic law, and reads
and writes the Hebrew tongue. He enjoys nothing but what he earns by the
labor of his own hands, and therefore manufactures coverlets, which he
stamps with his seal, and which his officers sell in the public market;
these articles are purchased by the nobles of the land, and from their
produce his necessaries are provided. The Calif is an excellent man,
trust-worthy and kind-hearted toward every one, but generally invisible
to the Mohammedans. The pilgrims, who come hither from distant countries
on their way to Mecca in Yemen, desire to be presented to him, and thus
address him from the palace: "Our lord, light of the Mohammedans and
splendor of our religion, show us the brightness of thy countenance";
but he heeds not their words. His servants and officers then approach
and pray: "O lord, manifest thy peace to these men who come from distant
lands and desire shelter in the shadow of thy glory." After this
petition, he rises and puts one corner of his garment out of the window,
which the pilgrims eagerly kiss. One of the lords then addresses them
thus: "Go in peace, for our lord, the light of the Mohammedans,

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

is well pleased and gives you his blessing." This prince being esteemed
by them equal to their prophet, they proceed on their way, full of joy
at the words addressed to them by the lord who communicated the message
of peace. All the brothers and other members of the Calif's family are
accustomed to kiss his garments. Every one of them possesses a palace
within that of the Calif, but they are all bound with chains of iron,
and a special officer is appointed over each household to prevent their
rising in rebellion against the great King. These measures are taken in
consequence of what occurred some time ago, when the brothers rebelled
and elected a king among themselves; to prevent which in future it was
decreed that all the members of the Calif's family should be chained, in
order to prevent their rebellious intentions. Every one of them,
however, resides in his palace, and is there much honored; and they
possess villages and towns, the rents of which are collected for them by
their stewards. They eat and drink, and lead a merry life. The palace of
the great King contains large buildings, pillars of gold and silver, and
treasures of precious stones.

The Calif leaves his palace but once every year, *viz.*, at the time of
the feast called Ramadan; on which occasion many visitors assemble from
distant parts, in order to have an opportunity of beholding his
countenance. He then bestrides the royal mule, dressed in kingly robes,
which are composed of gold and silver cloth. On his head he wears a
turban, ornamented with precious stones of inestimable value; but over
this turban is thrown a black veil, as a sign of humility, and as much
as to say: "See all this worldly honor will be converted into darkness
on the day of death." He is accompanied by a numerous retinue of
Mohammedan nobles, arrayed in rich dresses and riding upon horses,
princes of Arabia, of Media, of Persia, and even of Tibet, a country
distant three months' journey from Arabia. The procession goes from the
palace to the mosque at the Bozra gate, which is the metropolitan
mosque. All who walk in procession, both men and women, are dressed in
silk and purple. The streets and squares are enlivened with singing and
rejoicing,

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

and by parties who dance before the great King, called Calif. He is
saluted loudly by the assembled crowd, who cry: "Blessed art thou, our
lord and King." He thereupon kisses his garment, and by holding it in
his hand, acknowledges and returns the compliment. The procession moves
on into the court of the mosque, where the Calif mounts a wooden pulpit
and expounds their law unto them. The learned Mohammedans rise, pray for
him, and praise his great kindness and piety; upon which the whole
assembly answer, "Amen!" The Calif then pronounces his blessing, and
kills a camel, which is led thither for that purpose, and this is their
offering. It is distributed to the nobles, who send portions of it to
their friends, who are eager to taste of the meat killed by the bands of
their holy King, and are much rejoiced therewith. The Calif, after this
ceremony, leaves the mosque, and returns alone, along the banks of the
Tigris, to his palace, the noble Mohammedans accompanying him in boats,
until he enters this building. He never returns by the way he came; and
the path on the bank of the river is carefully guarded all the year
round, so as to prevent any one treading in his footsteps. The Calif
never leaves his palace again for a whole year. He is a pious and
benevolent man, and has erected buildings on the other side of the
river, on the banks of an arm of the Euphrates, which runs on one side
of the city. These buildings include many large houses, streets, and
hostelries for the sick poor, who resort thither in order to be cured.
There are about sixty medical warehouses here, all well provided from
the King's stores with spices and other necessaries; and every patient
who claims assistance is fed at the King's expense until his cure is
completed.

There is further a large building, called Dar-al-Maraphtan, <span
id="fr_59"></span>[41](#fn_56.md) in which are confined all the insane
persons who are met with, particularly during the hot season, every one
of whom is secured by iron chains until his reason returns, when he is
allowed to return to his home. For this purpose they are regularly
examined once a month by officers appointed by

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

the King for that purpose; and when they are found to be possessed of
reason they are immediately liberated. All this is done by the King in
pure charity toward all who come to Bagdad, either ill or insane; for
the King is a pious man, and his intention is excellent in this respect.

Bagdad contains about one thousand Jews, who enjoy peace, comfort, and
much honor under the government of the great King. Among them are very
wise men and presidents of the colleges, whose occupation is the study
of the Mosaic law. The city contains ten colleges. The principal of the
great college is the rabbi, R. Samuel, the son of Eli, principal of the
college Geon Jacob; the provost of the Levites is the president of the
second; R. Daniel, the master of the third college; R. Eleasar, the
fellow, presides over the fourth; R. Eleasar, the son of Tsemach, is
chief of the fifth college; he is master of the studies, and possesses a
pedigree of his descent from the prophet Samuel, who rests in peace, and
he and his brothers know the melodies that were sung in the temple
during its existence; R. Chasadiah, principal fellow, is the master of
the sixth, R. Chagai, the prince, the principal of the seventh, and R.
Esra, the president of the eighth college; R. Abraham, called Abu Tahir,
presides over the ninth, and R. Zakhai, son of Bosthenai, master of the
studies, is president of the tenth college. All these are called
Batlanim, *i.e.*, the Idle: because their sole occupation consists in
the discharge of public business. During every day of the week they
dispense justice to all the Jewish inhabitants of the country, except
Monday, which is set aside for assemblies under the presidency of the
rabbi Samuel, master of the college Geon Jacob, who on that day
dispenses justice to every applicant, and is assisted therein by the
other Batlanim, presidents of the colleges.

The principal of all these, however, is R. Daniel, the son of Chisdai,
who bears the titles of Prince of the Captivity and Lord, and who
possesses a pedigree which proves his descent from King David. The Jews
call him "Lord, Prince of the Captivity," and the Mohammedans entitle
him Saidna Ben Daoud, noble descendant of David. He holds great command

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

over all Jewish congregations under the authority of the
Emir-al-Mumenin, the lord of the Mohammedans, who has commanded that he
shall be respected, and has confirmed his power by granting him a seal
of office. Every one of his subjects, whether he be Jew or Mohammedan or
of any other faith, is commanded to rise in the presence of the prince
of the captivity, and to salute him respectfully, under a penalty of one
hundred stripes. Whenever he pays a visit to the King, he is escorted by
numerous horsemen, both Jews and Gentiles, and a crier proclaims aloud:
"Make way before our lord the son of David, as becomes his dignity"; in
Arabic, *Amilu tarik la-saidna ben-Daud*. Upon these occasions he rides
upon a horse, and his dress is composed of embroidered silk; on his head
he wears a large turban covered with a white cloth, and surmounted by a
chain (or diadem). The authority of the prince of the captivity extends
over the countries of Mesopotamia, Persia, Khorassan, Seba, which is
Yemen, Diarbekb, all Armenia and the land of Kota near Mount Ararat,
over the country of the Alanians, which is shut in by mountains, and has
no outlet except by the iron gates which were made by Alexander, over
Sikbia and all the provinces of the Turkomans unto the Aspisian
mountains, over the country of the Georgians unto the river Oxus (these
are the Girgasim of Scripture, and believe in Christianity), and as far
as the frontiers of the provinces and cities of Tibet and India. All the
Jewish congregations of these different countries receive authority from
the prince of captivity to elect rabbis and ministers, all of whom
appear before him in order to receive consecration <span
id="fr_60"></span>[42](#fn_57.md) and the permission to officiate, upon
which occasions presents and valuable gifts are offered to him, even
from the remotest countries. The prince of the captivity possesses
hostelries, gardens, and orchards in Babylonia, and extensive landed
property inherited from his forefathers, of which nobody can deprive
him. He enjoys a certain yearly income from the Jewish hostelries, the
markets, and, the merchandise of the country, which is levied in form of
a tax, over

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

and above what is presented to him from foreign countries. He is very
rich, an excellent scholar, and so hospitable that numerous Israelites
dine at his table every day. At the time of the installation of the
prince of the captivity he expends considerable sums in presents to the
King (or Calif), and to his princes and nobles. This ceremony is
performed by the King or Calif, who lays his hands on the prince, after
which the latter rides home from the King's abode to his own house,
seated in a royal State carriage, and accompanied with the sound of
various musical instruments; he afterward lays his hands on the
gentlemen of the university, to reinstall them. Many of the Jews of
Bagdad are good scholars and very rich. The city contains twenty-eight
Jewish synagogues, situated partly in Bagdad and partly in Al-Khorkh, on
the other side of the river Tigris, which runs through and divides the
city. The metropolitan synagogue of the prince of the captivity is
ornamented with pillars of richly colored marble, plated with gold and
silver; on the pillars are inscribed verses of the Psalms in letters of
gold. The ascent to the holy ark <span id="fr_61"></span>[43](#fn_58.md) is
composed of ten marble steps, on the uppermost of which are the stalls
set apart for the prince of the captivity and the other princes of the
house of David.

The city of Bagdad is three miles in circumference; the country in which
it is situated is rich in palm-trees, gardens, and orchards, so that
nothing equals it in Mesopotamia. Merchants of all countries resort
thither for purposes of trade, and it contains many wise philosophers,
well skilled in sciences, and magicians proficient in all sorts of
enchantment.

Two days from hence stands Gihiagin, or Ras-al-Ain, which is Resen, "the
great city"; <span id="fr_62"></span>[44](#fn_59.md) it contains about five
thousand Jews and a large synagogue. In a house near the synagogue is
the sepulcher of <span id="fr_63"></span>[45](#fn_60.md); and, in a cave
below it, that of his twelve disciples. From hence it is one day to
Babylon. This is the ancient Babel, and now lies in ruins; but the
streets

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

still extend thirty miles. The ruins of the palace of Nebuchadrezzar are
still to be seen; but people are afraid to venture among them on account
of the serpents and scorpions with which they are infested. Twenty
thousand Jews live within about twenty miles from this place, and
perform their worship in the synagogue of Daniel, who rests in peace.
This synagogue is of remote antiquity, having been built by Daniel
himself; it is constructed of solid stones and bricks. Here the traveler
may also behold the palace of Nebuchadrezzar, with the burning fiery
furnace into which were thrown Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; it is a
valley well known to everyone. <span id="fr_64"></span>[46](#fn_61.md)
Hillah, which is at a distance of five miles, contains about ten
thousand Jews and four synagogues, one of which is that of R. Meier,
whose sepulcher is in front of it; another is that of R. Seiri, son of
Hama, and R. Miri. <span id="fr_65"></span>[47](#fn_62.md) Public worship
is performed daily in these synagogues. Four miles from hence is the
tower built by the dispersed generation. <span
id="fr_66"></span>[48](#fn_63.md) It is constructed of bricks called
*al-ajurr*; the base measures two miles, the breadth two hundred and
forty yards, and the height about one hundred canna. A spiral passage,
built into the tower (in stages of ten yards each), leads up to the
summit, from which we have a prospect of twenty miles, the country being
one wide plain and quite level. The heavenly fire, which struck the
tower, split it to its very foundation.

Half a day from hence, at Napacha <span id="fr_67"></span>[49](#fn_64.md),
which contains two hundred Jews, is the synagogue of R. Isaac Napacha,
in front of which is his sepulcher. Three parasangs hence, on the banks
of the Euphrates, stands the synagogue of the prophet Ezekiel, who rests
in peace. <span id="fr_68"></span>[50](#fn_65.md) The place of the
synagogue

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

is fronted by sixty towers, the space between every two of which is also
occupied by a synagogue; in the court of the largest stands the ark, and
behind it is the sepulcher of Ezekiel, the son of Buzi the priest. This
monument is covered with a large cupola, and the building is very
handsome; it was erected by Jechoniah, King of Juda, and the thirty-five
thousand Jews who went along with him, when Evil-Merodach released him
from the prison, which was situated between the river Chaboras and
another river. The names of Jechoniah and of all those who came with him
are inscribed on the wall, the King's name first, that of Ezekiel last.
This place is considered holy even to the present day and is one of
those to which people resort from remote countries in order to pray,
particularly at the season of new year and atonement day. There are
great rejoicings here at that time, which are attended even by the
prince of the captivity and the presidents of the colleges of Bagdad.
The assembly is so large, that their temporary abodes cover twenty-two
miles of open ground, and attract many Arabian merchants, who keep a
market or fair. On the day of atonement the proper lesson of the day is
read from a very large manuscript Pentateuch in Ezekiel's own
handwriting. A lamp burns night and day on the sepulcher of the prophet,
and has always been kept burning since the day he lighted it himself;
the oil and wicks are renewed as often as necessary. A large house
belonging to the sanctuary contains a very numerous collection of books,
some of them as ancient as the second, some even coeval with the first
temple, it being the custom that whoever dies childless bequeaths his
books to this sanctuary. The inhabitants of the country lead to the
sepulcher all foreign Jews, who come from Media and Persia to visit it
in fulfilment of vows. The noble Mohammedans also resort thither to
pray, because they hold the prophet Ezekiel, on whom be peace! in great
veneration, and they call this place Dar Melicha (the agreeable abode);
the sepulcher is also visited by all devout Arabs. Within half a mile of
the synagogue are the sepulchers of Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, each
covered with a large cupola. Even in times of war,

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

neither Jew nor Mohammedan ventures to despoil and profane the sepulcher
of Ezekiel.

Three miles from hence stands the city of Al-Kotsonaath, containing
three hundred Jewish inhabitants and the sepulchers of R. Papa, R. Huna,
R. Joseph Sinai, and R. Joseph, the son of Hama, in front of each of
which is a synagogue in which Jews daily pray. Three parasangs to Ain
Japhata, which contains the sepulcher of the prophet Nahum the
Elkoshite, who rests in peace. In a Persian village, a day from thence,
are the sepulchers of R. Chisdai, R. Akiba, and R. Dossa; and in another
village, half a day's distance in the desert, are those -of R. David, R.
Juda., R. Kubreh, R. Sechora, and R. Aba; and on the river Lega, a
distance of one day, that of King Zedekiah, who rests in peace; the
latter is ornamented by a large cupola. It is one day hence to the city
of Kufa, which contains about seventy thousand Jews; and in it is the
sepulcher of King Jechoniah, which consists of a large building with a
synagogue in front. One day and a half to Sura, the place called in the
Talmud Matha-Mechasia, formerly the residence of the princes of the
captivity and of the principals of the colleges. At Sura are the
sepulchers of R. Shrira and his son Rabenu Hai, Rabenu Sadiah-al-Fajumi,
R. Samuel, the son of Chophni the priest, and Zephaniah, the son of
Khushi, the son of Gedaliah the prophet, and of many other princes of
the captivity, descendants of the house of David, who formerly resided
there before the city was ruined. Two days from hence is Shafjathib,
where there is a synagogue, which the Israelites erected with earth and
stones brought from Jerusalem, and which they called "the transplanted
of Nehardea." One day and a half from hence is El Jubar, or Pombeditba,
on the river Euphrates, containing about three thousand Jews, and the
synagogues, sepulchers, and colleges of Rab and Samuel.

At twenty-one days' journey through the desert of Sheba, or Al-Yemen,
from which Mesopotamia lies in a northerly direction, are the abodes of
the Jews who are called Beni (children of) Rechab, men of Thema. The
seat of their government is at Thema (or Tehama), where their prince and

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

governor rabbi Chanan resides. This city is large, and the extent of
their country is sixteen days' journey toward the northern mountain
range. They possess large and strong cities and are not subject to any
of the Gentiles, but undertake warlike expeditions into distant
provinces with the Arabians, their neighbors and allies, to take the
spoil and the prey. These Arabians are Bedouins, who live in tents in
the deserts and have no fixed abode, and who are in the habit of
undertaking marauding expeditions into the province of Yemen. The Jews
are a terror to their neighbors. Their country being very extensive,
some of them cultivate the land and rear cattle. A number of studious
and learned men, who spend their lives in the study of the law, are
maintained by the tithes of all produce, part of which is also employed
toward sustaining the poor and the ascetics, called "Mourners of Sion"
and "Mourners of Jerusalem." These eat no meat and abstain from wine,
dress always in black, and live in eaves or in low houses, and keep
fasts all their lives except on Sabbaths and holy-days. <span
id="fr_69"></span>[51](#fn_66.md) They continually implore the mercy of God
for the Jews in exile, and devoutly pray that he may have compassion on
them for the sake of his own great Dame; and they also include in their
prayers all the Jews of Tehama and of Telmas. The latter contains about
one hundred thousand Jews, who are governed by Prince Salomon, who, as
well as his brother, Prince Chanan, are descendants of the royal house
of David, who rests in peace, which is proved by their pedigrees. In
doubtful cases they solicit the decisions of the prince of the
captivity, and set aside forty days of every year, during which they go
in rent clothes, and keep fasts, and pray for all the Jews who live in
exile.

The province of which Thanaejm is the metropolis contains forty cities,
two hundred villages, and one hundred small towns, and is inhabited by
about three hundred thousand Jews. Thanaejm is a very strong city,
fifteen square miles in extent, and large enough to allow agriculture to
be carried on

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

within its boundaries; within which are also situated the palace of
Prince Salomon, and many gardens and orchards. Telmas is also a city of
considerable magnitude; it contains about one hundred thousand Jews, is
strongly fortified, and situated between two very high mountains. Many
of its inhabitants are well informed, wise, and rich. The distance from
Telmas to Chaibar is three days' journey. It is reported that these Jews
are of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, who
were led away captives by Shalmaneser, King of Ashur, and who repaired
into these mountainous regions, where they erected the above-named large
and strong cities. They carried on war with many kingdoms, and are not
easily to be reached because of their situation, which requires a march
of eighteen days through uninhabited deserts, and thus renders them
difficult of access.

Chaibar is also a very large city, and contains among its fifty thousand
Jewish inhabitants many learned scholars. The people of this city are
valiant, and engaged in wars with the inhabitants of Mesopotamia, with
those of the northern districts, and with those of Yemen, who live near
them; the latter province borders on India. It is a distance of
twenty-five days' journey from the country of these Jews to <span
id="fr_70"></span>[52](#fn_67.md) on the river Virah, in Yemen, which place
contains about three thousand Jews. Waset <span
id="fr_71"></span>[53](#fn_68.md) is distant seven days, and contains about
ten thousand Jews, among whom is R. Nedain. Five days hence bring us to
Bassora on the Tigris, which contains two thousand Israelites, many of
whom are learned and wealthy. From hence it is two days to <span
id="fr_72"></span>[54](#fn_69.md) on the river Samarra, or Shat-el-Arab.
This is the frontier of Persia, and contains fifteen hundred Jews. The
sepulcher of Ezra, the priest and scribe, is in this place, where he
died on his journey from Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes. In front of the
sepulcher a large synagogue and a Mohammedan mosque have been erected,
the latter as a mark of the veneration in which

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

Ezra is held by the Mohammedans, who are very friendly toward the Jews,
and resort thither to pray.

Four miles from thence begins Khuzistan, the Elam of Scripture, a large
province, which, however, is but partially inhabited, a portion of it
lying in ruins. Among the latter are the remains of Shushan, the
metropolis and palace of King Ahasuerus, which still contains very large
and handsome buildings of ancient date. It has seven thousand Jewish
inhabitants, with fourteen synagogues; in front of one of which is the
sepulcher of Daniel, who rests in peace. The river Ulai divides the city
into two parts, which are connected by a bridge; that portion of it
which is inhabited by the Jews contains the markets, to which all trade
is confined, and there all the rich dwell; on the other side of the
river they are poor, because they are deprived of the above-named
advantages, and have even no gardens or orchards. These circumstances
gave rise to jealousy, which was fostered by the belief that all honor
and riches originated in the possession of the remains of the prophet
Daniel, who rests in peace, and who was buried on the favored side of
the river. A request was made by the poor for permission to remove the
sepulcher to the other side, but it was rejected; upon which a war
arose, and was carried on between the two parties for a length of time;
this strife lasted until "their souls become loath," and they came to a
mutual agreement, by which it was arranged that the coffin which
contained Daniel's bones should be deposited alternately every year on
either side. Both parties faithfully adhered to this arrangement, until
it was interrupted by the interference of Sanjar Shah ben Shah <span
id="fr_73"></span>[55](#fn_70.md) who governs all Persia, and holds supreme
power over forty-five of its kings. This prince is called in Arabic
Sultan-al-Fars-al-Khabir (Supreme Commander of Persia), and his empire
extends from the banks of the Shat-el-Arab to the city of Samarkand and
the Kizil Ozein, enclosing the city of Nishapur, the cities of Media,
and the Chaphton mountains, and reaches as far as Tibet, in the forests
of which country that

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

quadruped is found which yields the musk. The extent of his empire is
four months and four days' journey. When this great emperor, Sanjar,
King of Persia, came to Shushan and saw that the coffin of Daniel was
removed from one side to the other, he crossed the bridge with a very
numerous retinue, accompanied by Jews and Mohammedans, and inquired into
the reason of those proceedings. Upon being told what we have related,
he declared it to be derogatory to the honor of Daniel, and commanded
that the distance between the two banks should be exactly measured, that
Daniel's coffin should be deposited in another coffin, made of glass,
and that it should be suspended from the center of the bridge by, chains
of iron. A place of public worship was erected on the spot, open to
every one who desired to say his prayers, whether he be Jew or Gentile;
and the coffin of Daniel is suspended from the bridge unto this very
day. The King commanded that, in honor of Daniel, nobody should be
allowed to fish in the river one mile on each side of the coffin.

It is three days hence to Rudbar, which contains twenty thousand Jews.,
among whom are many scholars and rich men, but they generally live under
great oppression. Two days hence bring us to the river Holwaul near
which you find the abodes of about four thousand Jews. Four days to the
district of Mulehet, <span id="fr_74"></span>[56](#fn_71.md) possessed by a
sect who do not believe in the tenets of Mohammed, but live on the
summit of high mountains, and pay obedience to the commands of the Old
Man in the country of the Assassins. Four congregations of Jews dwell
among them, and combine with them in their wars. They do not acknowledge
the authority of the kings of Persia, but live on their mountains,
whence they occasionally descend to make booty and to take spoil, with
which they retire to their mountain fortresses, beyond the reach of
their assailants. Some of the Jews who live in this country are
excellent scholars, and all acknowledge the authority of the prince of
the captivity, who resides at Bagdad in Babylonia.

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

Five days from hence is Amaria, which contains five-and-twenty thousand
Jews. This congregation forms part of those who live in the mountains of
Chaphton, and which amount to more than a hundred, extending to the
frontiers of Media. These Jews are descendants of those who were
originally led into captivity by King Shalmaneser; they speak the Syriac
language, and among them are many excellent Talmudic scholars; they are
neighbors to those of the city of Amaria, which is situated within one
day's journey of the empire of Persia, to the King of which they are
tributary. This tribute is collected by a deputy, and amounts here, as
well as in all Mohammedan countries, to one amiri of gold, equal to one
golden maravedi and one-third, for each male inhabitant of the age of
fifteen and upward.

Ten years ago <span id="fr_75"></span>[57](#fn_72.md) there rose a man of
the name of David El-Roy, of the city of Amaria, who had studied under
the prince of the captivity, Chisdai, and under Eli, the president of
the college of Geon Jacob in the city of Bagdad, and who became an
excellent scholar, being well versed in the Mosaic law, in the decisions
of the rabbis, and in the Talmud; understanding also the profane
sciences, the language and the writings of the Mohammedans, and the
scriptures of the magicians and enchanters. He made up his mind to rise
in rebellion against the King of Persia, to unite and collect the Jews
who live in the mountains of Chaphton, and with them to engage in war
with all Gentiles, making the conquest of Jerusalem his final object. He
gave signs to the Jews by false miracles, and assured them, "the Lord
has sent me to conquer Jerusalem, and to deliver you from the yoke of
the Gentiles." Some of the Jews did believe in him, and called him
Messiah. When the King of Persia became acquainted with these
circumstances, he sent and summoned David into his presence. The latter
went without fear, and when brought before the court he was asked, "Art
thou the king

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

of the Jews?" to which he made answer and said, "I am." Upon this the
King immediately commanded that he should be secured and put into the
prison where the captives are kept who are imprisoned for life, situated
in the city of Dabaristan, on the banks of the Kizil Ozein, which is a
broad river. After a lapse of three days, when the King sat in council
to take the advice of his nobles and officers respecting the Jews who
had rebelled against his authority, David appeared among them, having
liberated himself from prison without human aid. When the King beheld
him he inquired, "Who has brought thee hither, or who has set thee at
liberty?" To which David made answer, "My own wisdom and subtility; for
verily I fear neither thee nor thy servants." The King immediately
commanded that he should be seized, but his servants answered and said,
"We see him not, and are aware of his presence only by hearing the sound
of his voice." The King was very much astonished at David's exceeding
subtility, who thus addressed him: "I now go my own way"; and he went
out, followed by the King and all his nobles and servants, to the banks
of the river, where he took his shawl, spread it upon the water, and
crossed it thereupon. At that moment he became visible, and all the
servants of the King saw him cross the river on his shawl. He was
pursued by them in boats, but without success, and they all confessed
that no magician upon earth could equal him. He that very day traveled
to Amaria, a distance of ten days' journey, by help of the Shem
Hamphorash, <span id="fr_76"></span>[58](#fn_73.md) and related to the
astonished Jews all that had happened to him. The King of Persia
afterward sent to the Emir-el-Mumenin, the Calif of Bagdad, principal of
the Mohammedans, to solicit the influence of the prince of the
captivity, and of the presidents of the colleges, in order to check the
proceedings of David El-Roy, and threatening to put to death all Jews
who inhabited his empire. The congregations of Persia were

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>

very severely dealt with about that time, and sent letters to the prince
of the captivity and the presidents of the colleges at Bagdad to the
following purpose: "Why will you allow us to die, and all the
congregations of this empire? Restrain the deeds of this man, and
prevent thereby the shedding of innocent blood." The prince of the
captivity and the president of the colleges hereupon addressed David in
letters which run thus: "Be it known unto thee that the time of our
redemption has not yet arrived, and that we have not yet seen the signs
by which it is to manifest itself, and that by strength no man shall
prevail. We therefore command thee to discontinue the course thou hast
adopted, on pain of being excommunicated from all Israel." Copies of
these letters were sent to Sakhai, the prince of the Jews in Mosul, and
to R. Joseph the astronomer, who is called Borhan-al-Fulkh, and also
resides there, with the request to forward them to David El-Roy. The
last mentioned prince and the astronomer added letters of their own, in
which they advised and exhorted him; but he nevertheless continued in
his criminal career. This he carried on until a certain prince of the
name of Sin-el-Din, a vassal of the King of Persia, and a Turk by birth,
cut it short by sending for the father-in-law of David El-Roy, to whom
he offered ten thousand florins if he would secretly kill David El-Roy.
This agreement being concluded, he went to David's house while he slept,
and killed him on his bed, thus destroying his plans and evil designs.
Notwithstanding this, the wrath of the King of Persia still continued
against the Jews who lived in the mountains and in his country, who in
their turn craved the influence of the prince of the captivity with the
King of Persia. Their petitions and humble prayers were supported by a
present of one hundred talents of gold, in consideration of which the
anger of the King of Persia was subdued, and the land was tranquillized.

From that mountain to Hamadan <span id="fr_77"></span>[59](#fn_74.md) is a
journey of ten days; this was the metropolis of Media, and contains
about

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

fifty thousand Jews. in front of one of the synagogues is the sepulcher
of Mordecai and Esther. Four days from thence stands Dabaristan, <span
id="fr_78"></span>[60](#fn_75.md) on the river Kizil Ozein, it contains
about four thousand Jewish inhabitants. The city of, Ispahan is distant
seven days' journey; it is the metropolis of Persia, and residence of
the King, being twelve miles in, extent, and containing about fifteen
thousand Jews. Sar Shalom, the rabbi of this city and of all other towns
of the Persian Empire, has been promoted to the dignity by the prince of
the captivity.

Four days distant stands Shiraz, or Fars, a large city containing about
ten thousand Jews. It is seven days thence to Giva, <span
id="fr_79"></span>[61](#fn_76.md) a large city on the banks of the Oxus,
containing about eight thousand Jews. Very extensive commerce is carried
on in this place, to which traders of all countries and languages
resort; the country about it is very flat. Five days from thence, on the
frontiers of the kingdom, stands Samarkand, a city of considerable
magnitude, which contains about fifty thousand Jews. The prince rabbi
Obadiah is the governor of the community, which includes many wise and
learned men. Four days from thence is the province of Tibet, in the
forests of which country that beast is found which yields the musk. To
the mountains of Khazvin, on the river Kizil Ozein, it is a journey of
eight-and-twenty days. Jews of those parts, who live in Persia at
present, report that the cities of Nishapur are inhabited by four tribes
of Israel, *viz.*, the tribe of Dan, that of Zebulon, and that of
Naphthali, being part of the first exiles who were carried into
captivity by Shalmaneser, King of Ashur, as reported in Scripture. <span
id="fr_80"></span>[62](#fn_77.md) He banished them to Halah and Habor, the
mountains of Gozan, and the mountains of Media. The extent of their
country is twenty days' journey, and they possess many towns and cities
in the mountains. The river Kizil Ozein forms their boundary on one
side, and they are subject to no nation,

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

but are governed by their own prince, who bears the name of rabbi Joseph
Amarkhela Halevi. <span id="fr_81"></span>[63](#fn_78.md) Some of these
Jews are excellent scholars; others carry on agriculture; and many of
them are engaged in war with the country of Cuth, by way of the desert.
They are in alliance with the Caphar Tarac, or infidel Turks, <span
id="fr_82"></span>[64](#fn_79.md) who adore the wind and live in the
desert. This is a people who eat no bread and drink no wine, but devour
the meat raw and quite unprepared; they have no noses, but draw breath
through two small holes, and eat all sorts of meat, whether from clean
or unclean beasts. They are on very friendly terms with the Jews.

About eighteen years ago this nation invaded Persia with a numerous
host, and took the city of Rai, which they smote with the edge of the
sword, carrying off the spoil to their deserts. Nothing similar had been
seen before in the kingdom of Persia; and when the King of that country
was made acquainted with this occurrence, his wrath was kindled, for,
said he, "in the time of my predecessors no host like this ever issued
from the desert; I will go and will extinguish their name from the
earth." He raised the war-cry in the whole empire, collected all his
troops, and made inquiry whether he could find any guide that would show
him the place where his enemies pitched their tents. A man was met with,
who spoke thus to the King: "I will show thee the place of their
retreat, for I am one of them." The King promised to enrich him if he
would fulfil his promise and show him the way. Upon inquiry how many
provisions would be necessary for this long march through the desert,
the spy answered: "take with you bread and water for fifteen days, as
you will find no provisions whatever before you

<span id="page_422">p. 422</span>

reach their country." This advice being acted upon, they traveled
fifteen days in the desert, and as they met with nothing that could
serve for sustenance they became extremely short of provisions, and men
and beasts began to die. The King sent for the spy, and thus spoke to
him: "What is become of thy promise to show us our enemy?" No other
reply being made than "I have mistaken my way," the head of the spy was
cut off by the King's command. Orders were issued that every one who had
any provisions left should share them with his companion; but every
thing eatable was consumed, even the beasts, and after traveling
thirteen additional days in the desert they at last reached the
mountains of Khazvin, where the Jews dwell. They encamped in the gardens
and orchards, and near the springs, which are in the vicinity of the
river Kizil Ozein. It being the fruit season, they made free with it and
destroyed much, but no living being came forward. They saw, however,
cities and many towers on the mountains, and the King commanded two of
his servants to go and inquire the name of the nation which inhabited
these mountains, and to cross over to them, either in boats or by
swimming the river. They at last discovered a large bridge, fortified by
towers, and secured by a gate which was locked, and on the other side of
the bridge a considerable city. They shouted on their side of the bridge
until at last a man came forth to inquire what they wanted or to whom
they belonged. They could not, however, make themselves understood, but
brought an interpreter who spoke both languages; the questions being
repeated, they replied: "We are the servants of the King of Persia, and
have come to inquire who you are and whose subjects." The answer was:
"We are Jews, we acknowledge no king or prince of the Gentiles, but are
subjects of a Jewish prince." Upon inquiries after the Ghuzi, the Caphar
Tarac or infidel Turks, the Jews made answer: "Verily they are our
allies, and whoever seeks to harm them we consider our own enemy." The
two men returned and reported this to the King of Persia, who became
much afraid, and particularly so when, after a lapse of two days, the
Jews sent a herald to offer him battle.

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

The King said, "I am not come to make war against you, but against the
Caphar Tarac, or infidel Turks, who are my enemies; and if you attack me
I will certainly take my vengeance, and will destroy all the Jews in my
own kingdom, for I am well aware of your superiority over me in my
present position; but I entreat you to act kindly and not to harass me,
but allow me to fight with the Caphar Tarac, my enemy, and also to sell
me as much provision as I want for the maintenance of my host." The Jews
took counsel among themselves, and determined to comply with the request
of the King of Persia for the sake of his Jewish subjects. The King and
all his host were consequently admitted into the country of the Jews,
and during his stay of fifteen days he was treated with most honorable
distinction and respect. The Jews, however, meanwhile sent information
to their allies, the Caphar Tarac, and made them acquainted with the
above-mentioned circumstances; these took possession of all the mountain
passes, and assembled a considerable host, consisting of all the
inhabitants of that desert; and when the King of Persia went forth to
give them battle, the Caphar Tarac conquered, killing and slaying so
many of the Persians, that the King escaped to his country with only
very few followers. One of the horsemen of the retinue of the King
enticed a Jew of that country, named R. Moses, to go along with him; he
carried this man with him into Persia, and there made him a slave. Upon
a certain day, when the King was the spectator of sports carried on for
his amusement, and consisting principally of the exercise of handling
the bow, among all competitors none excelled this R. Moses. The King
thereupon inquired after this man by means of an interpreter, and was
told what had happened to him, and how he had been forcibly carried away
from his country by the horseman; upon learning which the King not only
immediately granted him his liberty, but gave him a dress of honor,
composed of silk and fine linen, and many other presents. A proposal was
also made to R. Moses, that if he would renounce his religion for that
of the Persians, he should be treated with the utmost kindness, should
gain considerable

<span id="page_424">p. 424</span>

riches, and be made the King's steward; but he refused, and said, "I can
not make up my mind to any such step." The King, however, placed him in
the house of the rabbi Sar Shalom, of the Ispahan congregation, who in
the course of time became his father-in-law. This very R. Moses related
all these things unto me.

From thence I returned to the country of Khuzistan, which lies on the
Tigris. This river runs downward and falls into the Indian Sea (Persian
Gulf), in the vicinity of an island called Kish. The extent of this
island is six miles, and the inhabitants do not carry on any
agriculture, for they have no rivers, nor more than one spring in the
whole island, and are consequently obliged to drink rain-water. It is,
however, a considerable market, being the spot to which the Indian
merchants and those of the islands bring their commodities. While the
traders of Mesopotamia, Yemen, and Persia import all silk and purple
cloths, flax, cotton, hemp, mash, wheat, barley, millet, rye, and all
other sorts of comestibles and pulse, which articles form objects of
exchange, those from India import great quantities of spices, and the
inhabitants of the island live by what they gain in their capacity of
brokers to both parties. The island contains about five hundred Jews. It
is ten days' passage by sea to El-Katif, a city with about five thousand
Israelites. In this vicinity the pearls are found: about the
twenty-fourth of the month of Nisan <span id="fr_83"></span>[65](#fn_80.md)
large drops of rain are observed upon the surface of the water, which
are swallowed by the reptiles, which thereupon close their shells and
fall to the bottom of the sea; about the middle of the month of
Thishri <span id="fr_84"></span>[66](#fn_81.md) people dive with the
assistance of ropes, collect these reptiles from the bottom, and bring
them up, after which they are opened and the pearls taken out.

Seven days from thence is Chulam, <span id="fr_85"></span>[67](#fn_82.md)
on the confines of the country of the sun-worshipers, who are
descendants of Kush, <span id="fr_86"></span>[68](#fn_83.md) are addicted
to astrology, and are all black. This

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

nation is very trustworthy in matters of trade; and whenever foreign
merchants enter their port, three secretaries of the king immediately
repair on board their vessels, write down their names, and report them
to him. The king thereupon grants them security for their property,
which they may even leave in the open fields without any guard. One of
the king's officers sits in the market, and receives goods that may have
been found anywhere, and which he returns to those applicants who can
minutely describe them. This custom is observed in the whole empire of
the king. From Easter to new year, <span id="fr_87"></span>[69](#fn_84.md)
during the whole of the summer, the heat is extreme. From the third hour
of the day people shut themselves up in their houses until the evening,
at which time everybody goes out. The streets and markets are lighted
up, and the inhabitants employ all the night upon their business, which
they are prevented from doing in the daytime by the excessive heat. . .
.

 

Here are the confines of Germany, a country full of hills and mountains.
The Jewish congregations of Germany inhabit the banks of the great river
Rhine, from Cologne, where the empire commences, unto Cassanburg, the
frontier of Germany, which is fifteen days' journey, and is called
Ashkenas by the Jews. These are the cities of Germany which contain
congregations of Israelites, all situated on the river
Moselle---Coblence, Andernach, Kaub, Kartania, Bingen, Worms, and
Mistran. In fact, the Jews are dispersed over all countries, and whoever
hinders Israel from being collected shall never see any good sign, and
shall not live with Israel. And at the time which the Lord has appointed
to be a limit of our captivity and to exalt the horn of his anointed,
every one shall come forth and shall say, "I will lead the Jews and I
will assemble them."

These cities contain many eminent scholars; the congregations are on the
best terms with one another, and are friendly toward strangers. Whenever
a traveler visits them they are rejoiced thereat and hospitably receive
him. They are full

<span id="page_426">p. 426</span>

of hopes, and say: "Be of good spirit, dear brethren, for the salvation
of the Lord will be quick, like the twinkling of an eye; and, indeed,
were it not that we had doubted hitherto that the end of our captivity
had not yet arrived, we should have assembled long ago; but this is
impossible before the time of song arrive, and the sound of the cooing
turtle gives warning; then will the message arrive, and we will say, The
name of the Lord be exalted!" <span id="fr_88"></span>[70](#fn_85.md) They
send letters to one another, by which they exhort to hold firm in the
Mosaic law. Those that spend their time as mourners of the downfall of
Sion and the destruction of Jerusalem are always dressed in black
clothes, and pray for mercy before the Lord, for the sake of their
brethren.

Beside the cities which we have already mentioned as being in Germany,
there are, further, Astransburg, Duidisburg, Mantern, Pisingas, Bamberg,
Zor, and Regensburg, on the confines of the empire; all these cities
contain many rich and learned Jews. Farther on is the country of
Bohemia, called Prague. Here begins Sclavonia, called by the Jews who
inhabit it Khenaan, because the inhabitants sell their children to all
nations, which is also applicable to the people of Russia. The latter
country is very extensive, reaching from the gates of Prague to those of
Kiev, a large city on the confines of the empire. The country is very
mountainous and full of forests; in the latter the beasts called
vaiverges <span id="fr_89"></span>[71](#fn_86.md) are met, which yield the
sable fur or ermine. In winter the cold is so intense that nobody
ventures to leave his house. So far the kingdom of Russia.

The kingdom of France, called by the Jews Tsarphat, reaches from the
town of Alsodo to Paris, the metropolis, and is six days in extent. This
city, situated on the river Seine, belongs to King Louis, and contains
many learned men, the equal of which are to be met with at present
nowhere upon earth: they employ all their time upon the study of the
law, are hospitable to all travelers, and on friendly terms with all
their Jewish brethren.

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

May the Lord in his mercy be full of compassion toward them and us, and
may he fulfil toward both the words of his Holy Scripture (Deut. xx. 3),
"Then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon
thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the
Lord thy God hath scattered thee."--Amen, Amen, Amen.

THE END

<span id="fn_16"></span>[383:1](mhl20.htm#fr_19.md) The expression "of
blessed memory" is generally added by Jews when mentioning the "honored
dead" (see Proverbs x. 7), and recurs frequently in the following
narrative.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[383:2](mhl20.htm#fr_20.md) This city was one of
great antiquity; and at this time the remains of its ancient walls
appear to have been very remarkable. Destroyed at an earlier period by
the Saracens, Tarragona was rebuilt in the twelfth century.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[387:3](mhl20.htm#fr_21.md) Alexander III, who held
the papacy from 1159 to 1181. The employment of Jews in the service of
the pope is a circumstance worthy of remark.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[387:4](mhl20.htm#fr_22.md) The book Aruch was a
celebrated dictionary, completed by Rabbi Nathan at Rome, in A.D. 1101.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[387:5](mhl20.htm#fr_23.md) These singular legends
relating to the ancient buildings in Rome are chiefly taken from the
writings of Josephus ben Gorion. Some of them may be compared with
similar tales which are found in the works of Christian writers, and of
which several examples are inserted in William of Malmesbury's History.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[388:6](mhl20.htm#fr_24.md) The time of the
destruction of both temples at Jerusalem. The day is still one of fast
and mourning to all Jews, and is celebrated as such by all synagogues.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[388:7](mhl20.htm#fr_25.md) These were ten ancient
teachers of the Mishna, who suffered violent death in the period between
Vespasian and Hadrian. A late legend not only connected these
persecutions as one event, but assigned to the victims a common
sepulcher at Rome. The legend contains a conversation of the ten martyrs
with the emperor. Several of the ten were certainly not buried in Rome;
the sepulchers of three, Akiba, Ishmael, and Juda ben Thema, were shown
in Palestine in the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries. Antipatris is
said by others to be the place of the sepulcher of R. Akiba. A more
recent catalogue notices, as known in Palestine, the sepulchers of R.
Juda, son of Baba, and Simon, son of Gamaliel, two others of the "ten
martyrs."

<span id="fn_23"></span>[389:8](mhl20.htm#fr_26.md) The modern
Nahr-el-Mukattua. See Judges v. 21.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[389:9](mhl20.htm#fr_27.md) Joshua xix. 13. Modern
writers identify Kaiffa with the ancient Ephah, and not with Gath.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[390:10](mhl20.htm#fr_28.md) To which place,
according to the tenets of the Talmudic Jews, the offerings are
confined, and since the destruction of which they have been
discontinued.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[391:11](mhl20.htm#fr_29.md) critics and travelers
appear to confirm this statement relating to the peculiar pronunciation
of the three letters by the Samaritans.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[391:12](mhl20.htm#fr_30.md) The knights templars.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[392:13](mhl20.htm#fr_31.md) Jesus is thus called
in the Talmud.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[394:14](mhl20.htm#fr_32.md) After the slaughter of
the Jews of Jerusalem by the crusaders, the few that were saved from
destruction were dispersed in all directions. These persons who mourned
over these unhappy circumstances were called "mourners of Jerusalem,"
and are mentioned under that title more than once by Benjamin. We find
these mourners even among the Caraites about 1147. We read in several
ancient Jewish writers of the danger incurred by the Jews who visited
Jerusalem while it remained in the power of the Christians. Pethachia
found only one Jew at Jerusalem, whereas Benjamin speaks of 200. A
numerous congregation was again to be met with there about 1190; but
about 1216 great discord prevailed among them in consequence of the
pretensions of the different congregations.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[394:15](mhl20.htm#fr_33.md) It may be observed
that most of the richer stuffs, the siclatons, etc., used in the west of
Europe during the Middle Ages, came from the East, which accounts for
the number of. dyers, mentioned by the traveler.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[395:16](mhl20.htm#fr_34.md) The "House of Abraham"
is still shown to travelers, about an hour's ride from Hebron, the site
being occupied by the ruins of a small convent.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[395:17](mhl20.htm#fr_35.md) Joshua xv. 44. It is
the Bethogabris of the Greek and Latin writers, and supposed to be the
Eleutheropolis of the early Christian fathers.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[396:18](mhl20.htm#fr_36.md) The rocks of Jonathan,
mentioned (I Sam. xiv. 5) as being between Gibeah and Michmash, and
which formed a narrow path between the two places, were also seen by
Robinson and Smith. "Directly between Jeba and Mukhmas are two conical
hills, not very high, which are probably the scene of Jonathan's
romantic adventure against the Philistines, recorded in 1 Sam. xiv."

<span id="fn_34"></span>[396:19](mhl20.htm#fr_37.md) The Azotus of the
ancient geographers.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[397:20](mhl20.htm#fr_38.md) The Esdraela of the
Greeks, called by the historians of the crusades Gerinum and Zarain.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[397:21](mhl20.htm#fr_39.md) During the Middle Ages
Jews were not unfrequently employed as astrologers by the Arabian
princes. R. Isaac, the son of Baruch (A. D. 1080), appears, among
others, to have rendered services of this kind to Almohammad. King
Alphonso of Castile also entertained Jews who were proficients in
astrology. The surname astrologer, was borne by Abraham in Tiberias.
Eliezer, author of an astrological book of chances, lived in 1559. We
also find mention of Joseph, astrologer of Seifeddin, sultan of Mosul;
R. Isaac, an astronomer of the twelfth century in France; and Salomon,
an astronomer in Nineveh.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[397:22](mhl20.htm#fr_40.md) Jochanan, son of
Zakhai, was a celebrated teacher of the Mishna in the time of Vespasian;
later catalogues mention his sepulcher in Tiberias.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[397:23](mhl20.htm#fr_41.md) This identification is
evidently an error, as Thimnatha was in Judea, far to the south of
Tiberias, and could not be Tebnin. Benjamin falls into another error in
placing here the sepulcher of Samuel, who was buried in Ramah. Mr. Asher
proposes to read Simeon.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[398:24](mhl20.htm#fr_42.md) Meirûn is still a
place of pilgrimage to the Jews of the vicinity, who resort thither on
certain days to say prayers on the sepulchers of some rabbis; and this
corroborates our text, according to which Hillel and Shamai, the two
most celebrated teachers of the Talmud, who flourished before the birth
of our Savior, are interred in a cave near Merûn. This legend must have
been very prevalent at our author's time, as it is also reported by
Pethachia, who adds that a large stone vase, situated in the cave of the
sepulcher, filled itself spontaneously with water whenever a worthy man
entered it for the purpose of devotion, but remained empty if the
visitor was a man of doubtful character. The two other persons whose
sepulchers are mentioned here were celebrated teachers of the law, who
flourished in the third and second centuries.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[398:25](mhl20.htm#fr_43.md) All the persons
mentioned here were celebrated rabbis of the first century before, and
the three centuries after Christ, except Barak, who is well known by the
fourth chapter of the book of Judges.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[398:26](mhl20.htm#fr_44.md) This is Paneas, or
Baneas, the ancient Cæsarea Philippi.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[398:27](mhl20.htm#fr_45.md) This identification is
not quite correct, the ancient Dan having been situated on another small
rivulet, still called Dan, and distant about four Roman miles west of
Paneas on the way to Tyre. William of Tyre also identifies Dan with
Cæsarea. The apparent source of the Jordan flows from under a cave at
the foot of a precipice, in the sides of which are several niches with
Greek inscriptions, which Benjamin has mistaken for the altar of Micha.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[399:28](mhl20.htm#fr_46.md) This is a mistake of
Rabbi Benjamin, as this term, used in Deut, xi. 24, means the
Mediterranean.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[399:29](mhl20.htm#fr_47.md) It is hardly necessary
to state that this was the celebrated sultan of Damascus, Aleppo, and
Egypt, so well known in the history of the crusades. He reigned from
1145 to 1173.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[401:30](mhl20.htm#fr_48.md) The earthquake alluded
to visited this part of Syria in 1157, at which period Hamah, Antiochia,
Emessa, Apamea, Laodicea, and many other cities, were laid in ruins. R.
Benjamin calls the river Orontes Jabbok; the Arabians call it Oroad, or
Asi. Reiha, or Rieha, is a name still borne by a place and mountain in
this part of the road from Damascus to Aleppo.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[401:31](mhl20.htm#fr_49.md) Numb. xxii. 5. Deut.
xxiii. 4. It is the Barbarissus of the Romans. Bales was taken by the
crusaders under Tancred in 1111.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[401:32](mhl20.htm#fr_50.md) The Dauses, or Davana,
of the Greeks. In the history of the crusades, Kalat (or fort) Jiaber is
often mentioned; and the circumstances alluded to by our author are told
at length by Desguignes. In Abulfeda's time this place was a deserted
ruin; but the castle, built on a mound of marl and gypsum, still stands,
thirty-five miles below Bir, on the left bank of the Euphrates.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[402:33](mhl20.htm#fr_51.md) The Callinicus of the
Greeks, afterward called Nicephorium.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[402:34](mhl20.htm#fr_52.md) The Carrhæ of the
ancients. The site of the house of Abraham is still pointed out as an
object of veneration. Mr. Asher observes that, from Aleppo to Racca, our
author, like most modern and ancient travelers, followed the course of
the Euphrates; but being probably attracted, like Marco Polo, by the
considerable trade then carried on at Mosul, he proceeded thither from
Racca, by way of Haran, Nisibis, and Jezireh, a route pointed out as
probably used by Alexander on Rennel's map of the retreat of the Ten
Thousand.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[402:35](mhl20.htm#fr_53.md) It appears that the
name of a city is omitted here. Our author probably wrote "from thence
to Ras-el-Ain," at which place the Khabur becomes a formidable river.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[402:36](mhl20.htm#fr_54.md) This is of course not
the true Ararat. It is called Jebel Judi. The island is the ancient
Bezebde.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[403:37](mhl20.htm#fr_55.md) The ancient Erbela.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[403:38](mhl20.htm#fr_56.md) The ancient Cercusium.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[403:39](mhl20.htm#fr_57.md) All these were
celebrated Jewish rabbis in the earlier centuries of the Christian era.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[401:40](mhl20.htm#fr_58.md) He Calif alluded to by
Benjamin was either Moktafi, who died in 1160, or Mostanjeh
abul-Modhaffer, who reigned from his death to 1170. It is probable that
Benjamin was at Bagdad in 1164.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[406:41](mhl20.htm#fr_59.md) Dar-al-Morabittan in
Arabic; literally, "abode of those who require being chained," *i.e.*,
of the raving mad.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[408:42](mhl20.htm#fr_60.md) The ceremony of
consecration, performed by the prince of captivity, consisted in his
laying his hands on the heads of the candidates.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[409:43](mhl20.htm#fr_61.md) The place where the
rolls of the Pentateuch are deposited. It is generally elevated above
the seats of the congregation.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[409:44](mhl20.htm#fr_62.md) Gen. x. 12. Ras-al-Ain
is the Ressaina of the Romans; it is erroneously identified with Resen.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[409:45](mhl20.htm#fr_63.md) The name is omitted in
all editions.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[410:46](mhl20.htm#fr_64.md) This tradition of the
burning furnace is mentioned by the Arabian geographers, by whom we are
further informed that the ashes still remained.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[410:47](mhl20.htm#fr_65.md) These are also some of
the early rabbis concerning whom the Jews possess many legends; the
places of burial of others are mentioned further on.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[410:48](mhl20.htm#fr_66.md) Benjamin here alludes
to the Birs Nimrod, which is, however, more than four miles from Hillah.
*Al-ajurr* is the Persian word for these bricks.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[410:49](mhl20.htm#fr_67.md) Perhaps the Nachaba of
Ptolemy. It is not found in modern maps.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[410:50](mhl20.htm#fr_68.md) This celebrated
sepulcher is still a place of pilgrimage to the Jews and Mohammedans in
the East.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[413:51](mhl20.htm#fr_69.md) Fasting being
prohibited on these days by the Talmud. This proves Niebuhr's
supposition, that they were Talmudists, to be correct.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[414:52](mhl20.htm#fr_70.md) The name of a city
appears to be omitted here.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[414:53](mhl20.htm#fr_71.md) Waset is the ancient
Cybate. The Hebrew text reads Naset, which Mr. Asher has rightly
corrected.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[414:54](mhl20.htm#fr_72.md) The name of a city is
omitted here; no doubt Kornah, on the Samarra, or ancient Delos.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[415:55](mhl20.htm#fr_73.md) Sanjar was a very
celebrated and powerful prince. He conquered Samarkand in 1140, and died
in 1157, shortly before Benjamin visited the East.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[416:56](mhl20.htm#fr_74.md) Benjamin's account of
the Assassins, and their residence at Mulehet, coincides very closely
with that given by Marco Polo. It has been supposed that the sect of the
Assassins originated in this district of Persia.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[417:57](mhl20.htm#fr_75.md) That is, probably, in
A.D. 1155; for 1165 appears to be about the year in which Benjamin of
Tudela visited Persia. The history of David El-Roy, and the scene of his
imposture, have been illustrated by Major Rawlinson in a memoir
communicated to the Geographical Society of London, and printed in its
Transactions.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[418:58](mhl20.htm#fr_76.md) Shem Hamphorash,
literally, "the explained name," the letters of the word "Jehovah" in
their full explanation, a mystery known but to very few, and by which it
is believed wonders may be executed. The wonders performed by Jesus are
ascribed in the Talmud to his knowledge of this mystery.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[419:59](mhl20.htm#fr_77.md) Hamadan, which is now
in a state of ruin, is said to stand on or near the site of the ancient
Ecbatana. The sepulcher of Mordecai and Esther is still shown there.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[420:60](mhl20.htm#fr_78.md) This town is
conjectured to be Farahabad.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[420:61](mhl20.htm#fr_79.md) The city of Khiva.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[420:62](mhl20.htm#fr_80.md) 2 Kings xvii. 6, and
xviii. 11. "And the King of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria,
and put them in Halah and in Habor, by the river Gozan, and in the
cities of the Medes."

<span id="fn_78"></span>[421:63](mhl20.htm#fr_81.md) Of the tribe of Levi,
the descendants of which are divided into Leviim and Khohanim, and are
the only Jews who to this day claim the descent from a certain tribe,
all others having mixed and become extinct in the course of time.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[421:64](mhl20.htm#fr_82.md) These were the Ghuzes,
a Turkish tribe who emigrated in the twelfth century from the country to
the north of the Oxus. The events mentioned in the text seem to have
occurred in 1153, when the Ghuzes revolted against the Persians,
defeated the Sultan, and plundered Mero and Nishapur. The Sultan was
made a prisoner, and only escaped and returned to his own country in
1156.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[424:65](mhl20.htm#fr_83.md) In April.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[424:66](mhl20.htm#fr_84.md) In October.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[424:67](mhl20.htm#fr_85.md) Chulam, the Koulam of
Marco Polo and Ibn-Batuta, was an important place on the coast of
Malabar, but is much reduced in modern times.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[424:68](mhl20.htm#fr_86.md) Negroes.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[425:69](mhl20.htm#fr_87.md) *I.e.*, from April to
October.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[426:70](mhl20.htm#fr_88.md) Psalms xxxv. 27.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[426:71](mhl20.htm#fr_89.md) Vaiverges, Polish
*wiewiórka*, the white squirrel, a quadruped the skins of which were
considered to be of great value.
