# CHAPTER III.

REGULATIONS CONCERNING WHEREWITH AND WHERE AN ERUB MAY BE MADE. WHEREBY
AN ERUB BECOMES INVALID. THE ERUB OF LIMITS, WITH ITS CONDITIONS. WHEN A
FESTIVAL OR NEW YEAR PRECEDES THE SABBATH.

MISHNA: The Erub may be effected with all kinds of victuals excepting
water and salt. All kinds of victuals may be bought with the proceeds of
the second tithe except water and salt. One who has vowed to abstain
from food, may partake of water and salt. The Erub maybe made for a
Nazarite with wine and for an ordinary Israelite with heave-offering.
Symmachus said: Unconsecrated things only may be used for the Erub of an
ordinary Israelite. The Erub of a priest may be placed on a spot which
had formerly been used as a cemetery. R. Jehudah said: It may even be
placed in an actual burying-ground, since the priest may make a
partition between himself and the burying-ground and then eat the Erub.

GEMARA: R. Johanan said: "We must not accept all the Mishnaoth that
commence with a general rule as final, even such as are supplemented
with an exception." Said Rabhina, according to another version R.
Na'hman: We can infer this from our Mishna above. It is stated therein,
that with all kinds of victuals an Erub may be effected, excepting water
and salt, and there are certain mushrooms with which an Erub cannot be
effected also. Consequently we may assume from this Mishna, that all
those commencing with a general rule, even such as are supplemented with
exceptions, need not be accepted as final.

"*All kinds of victuals*," etc. One of the two sages, R. Eliezer or R.
Jose bar R. Hanina, taught as follows: The Mishna means to state, that
an Erub must not be made with either water or salt, but with the two
together it is allowed," and one of them taught the same with reference
to second tithes, viz.: With the proceeds of the second tithes salt or
water must not be bought; but the two together maybe bought. The one who
applies this opinion to second tithes does so even to a greater

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

degree in the case of the Erub; but the one who applies this to an Erub
does not do so in the case of the second tithes; because some fruit must
be bought therewith. When R. Itz'hak came from Palestine, he taught this
to apply to second tithes also.

An objection was made: R. Jehudah ben Gadish testified in the presence
of R. Eliezer, that his father's house used to buy fish-brine with the
proceeds of the second tithes. Said R. Eliezer to him: "Perhaps thou
didst not observe, that there were pieces of fish in the brine." Now, R.
Jehudah ben Gadish himself testifies that fish-brine was bought and that
is at least an article of food; but he certainly would not permit salt
and water.

Said R. Joseph: "R. Itz'hak in permitting water and salt to be bought
with the proceeds of second tithes refers to a case where the water also
contained some oil." Said Abayi: "If such be the case, why does he say
water and salt, it would be virtually buying the oil?" The answer is:
"If the money was paid for the oil and incidentally also for the water
and salt." Is it allowed to buy it indirectly? Yea; it is allowed, as we
have learned: Ben Bagbag said: It is written \[Deut. xiv. 26\]: "And
thou shalt lay out that money for whatsoever thy soul longeth after, for
oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever
thy soul asketh of thee." "For oxen" signifies for oxen together with
the hide, "for sheep" with the wool, for wine "together with the
barrel," or for strong drink even if it turned sour.

R. Johanan said. "The man who will explain to me the dictum of Ben
Bagbag concerning the oxen, I will carry his clothes after him to the
bath-house." Why is this so? Wherein does he find a difference between
the oxen and the sheep? Because if we infer from the verse, that the
sheep may be bought together with their wool, which can be shorn, it is
self-evident that an ox must be bought with the hide, for how can it be
bought otherwise? Hence the inference taken by Ben Bagbag from the oxen
is superfluous.

Wherein do R. Jehudah ben Gadish, R. Eliezer, and the following Tanaim
differ? R. Jehudah ben Gadish and R. Eliezer interpret an extension and
a limitation thus: "Thou shalt lay out that money for whatsoever thy
soul longeth" is an extension then; "or oxen, or for sheep, for wine or
for strong drink" is a limitation; "or for whatever thy soul asketh of
thee" is again an extension. Thus we have an extension, a limitation and
another extension. What is the extension? "For every.

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

thing." But what is the limitation? According to R. Eliezer, it is
fish-brine, and according to R. Jehudah ben Gadish it is water and salt,
and the other Tanaim do not refer to extension and limitation but to the
effect of general and particular terms, as we have learned in a
Boraitha: "Thou shalt lay out that money for whatsoever thy soul
desireth" is a general term, "for oxen, for sheep, etc.," is a
particular term, and again "or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee"
is a general term; hence we have a general term, a particular term and
another general term, and wherever there is a particular term in the
midst of two general terms the particular term determines the rule. Thus
the particular thing to be bought with the proceeds of second tithes is
fruit of fruit (*i.e.*, a calf born of a cow or oil of olives) and
everything generated above the ground; but salt and water or fish-brine
is not included.

In another Boraitha however we were taught, that as the particular term
refers to something born on or growing out of the ground, so does also
the general term refer to subjects of this kind. What is the point of
difference between the two Boraithas? Said Abayi: "Concerning fish."
According to the Boraitha which holds, that the particular term refers
to fruit of fruit and everything generated above the ground, fish is
also included as it derives its sustenance from the earth; but according
to the Boraitha which holds, that only something born on or growing out
of the ground is meant, fish is excluded because it is generated in the
waters.

Said R. Jehudah in the name of R. Samuel bar Shilas quoting Rabh: "An
Erub may be made with lettuce, Halaglugoth (a certain edible plant) and
clover but not with green rye-stalks and bad figs." How can he say that
clover may be used? Have we not learned, that clover maybe eaten only by
those who have many children but not by such as have none? Have we not
learned that for a Nazarite an Erub may be made with wine and for an
ordinary Israelite with heave-offering? Although neither of these two
are allowed to partake of those things, there are others who may do so
and the same case can be applied to clover, while there are some who are
not allowed to eat it, there are others who may; hence all may use it
for the purpose of making an Erub.

With green rye-stalks it is not allowed? Did not R. Jehudah say in the
name of Rabh, that hops and green rye-stalks may be used to make an Erub
and the benediction to be pronounced

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

over these is "Blessed be He, etc., who hath created the fruits of the
earth"? This presents no difficulty; for Rabh said, that rye-stalks were
not permitted to be used, before he came to Babylon, not knowing that it
was used for food, but when he learned that such was the case, he
allowed its use.

With bad figs it is not allowed? Have we not learned, that palm-tops may
be bought with the proceeds of second tithes and that they are not
subject to defilement incidental to eatables, and bad figs may also be
bought with the proceeds of second tithes but they *are* subject to the
defilement? R. Jehudah, however, said that palm-tops were considered the
same as trees under all circumstances with the exception that they may
be bought with the proceeds of second tithes and that bad figs are
considered the same as other fruit except that they are not subject to
tithing? Thou sayest, they are subject to defilement? That is a
different matter. The reason of that is, as R. Johanan stated in another
case, that they can be made good through cooking over a fire and
therefore they are subject to defilement, but they must not be used for
making an Erub.

The text states, that hops and green rye-stalks may be used for making
an Erub, etc. What quantity of hops should be used? As R. Yechiel said
elsewhere, that a handful is sufficient, so it is also in this case; a
handful will suffice for two meals. What quantity of green rye-stalks
must be used? Said Rabba bar Tuvia bar Itz'hak in the name of Rabh: A
bundle of the same size as that made by the peasants.

R. Helkyah bar Tuvia said: An Erub may be made with a Kalia (a certain
root as hard as a piece of dry wood). How is that possible? Can it be
eaten? He means to say when the root is young and tender. What quantity
should be used? Said R. Yechiel: "A handful."

R. Jeremiah went out into the villages and was asked whether an Erub may
be made with bean-pods. He did not know what to answer. When he came
back to the college, he was told, that R. Janai said, "It was allowed,"
and as to the quantity R. Yechiel said, "A handful."

R. Hamnuna said: "An Erub must not be made with raw mangold. Because R.
Hisda said that raw mangold can kill a man." But we see, that some
people do eat it and it does not harm them? Yea; but they eat marigold
which is partially cooked and is not quite raw.

R. Hisda said: "Cooked mangold is good for the heart, for

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

the eyes and above all for the stomach." Said Abayi: Such is the case if
the mangold was cooked over the centre of a big fire so long that it
sizzled.

Rabha said at one time: I feel, that I am at present in the same
condition as Ben Azai was in the markets of Tiberias. \[Ben Azai used to
lecture in the markets of Tiberias and in his time was the most
sagacious among all the sages, so that he once said: All the sages of
Israel are as the peel of garlic compared to me except the bald-head
(meaning R. Aqiba).\] So one of the scholars came to Rabha and asked
him, how many apples it would take to make an Erub? He answered: "Art
thou then certain that an Erub may be made with apples?" With apples it
is not allowed? Have we not learned in a Mishna, that a quantity of
mixed eatables equal to two eggs is sufficient to make the body of a man
incapable of touching heave-offerings? <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) If there is sufficient of those mixed
eatables for two meals they maybe used for making an Erub. If there is a
quantity of those mixed eatables equal to one egg, they arc subject to
the defilement incidental to eatables. Why this question? 'Tis true that
the Mishna mentions all eatables, but have we not learned, that wherever
a general rule is laid down, even when supplemented with exceptions, it
need not be accepted as final? Consequently apples may be excluded? This
question is not based upon the statement that all eatables may be used,
but upon the fact that a quantity of mixed eatables equal to two eggs
may be used for an Erub, and if equal to one egg it is subject to
defilement incidental to eatables. And if apples are subject to
defilement, why should they not be used for an Erub? What should be the
quantity of apples used? Said R. Na'hman: "A Kabh."

An objection was raised: R. Simeon b. Elazar said: A measure of spices,
a litter of herbs, ten nuts, five *persicum* (apricots), two
pomegranates, one citron. (This was a prescribed quantity for giving
charity by the owner of a vineyard.) And Ghurseck bar Dori in the name
of R. Menashiah bar Shegublick quoting Rabh said: The same quantity is
sufficient for an Erub. Now why shall not apples also be equal to
apricots and only five should be sufficient for an Erub? The *persicums*
are more valuable, hence five are sufficient, but apples not being so
valuable, therefore a Kabh is required.

Said R. Joseph: May the Lord forgive R. Menashiah bar Shegublick.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I said this to him
in reference to the following Mishna and he said this in reference to
the above Boraitha. This is the Mishna (mentioned above). Nothing less
than a half a Kabh of wheat and a Kabh of barley should be given to a
poor man by the owner of a barn. R. Meir, however, says a half a Kabh of
barley and one Kabh and a half of Kusmin, <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) a Kabh of three or the weight of a
maneh <span id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25.md) of pressed figs; R. Aqiba said
a half of a maneh; and a half a lug of wine; R. Aqiba said a quarter of
a lug; and a quarter of a lug of oil; R. Aqiba said an eighth of a lug.
Concerning other fruits, however, said Abba Saul: A measure of fruit,
the sale of which would realize sufficient for the purchase of two
meals; and to this Mishna I added in the name of Rabh that the same
quantities are needed for an Erub.

The text said: If there is sufficient of mixed eatables for two meals
they may be used for an Erub. R. Joseph meant to say: "If there is
enough of each kind for one meal." Said Rabba to him: "Nay; it is
sufficient if there was enough of each kind for a half, a third or even
a quarter of a meal."

Rabh said: "One may make an Erub with wine of the quantity of two
quarters of a lug." Must we have so much? Did we not learn that R. Simon
ben Elazar said: "With sufficient wine necessary for the eating of two
meals," and by that he means boiled wine in which bread sufficient for
two meals is soaked.

Rabh said again: "One may make an Erub with vinegar sufficient for the
soaking of food for two meals." R. Gidel said in the name of Rabh: "By
that is meant enough vinegar to soak herbs sufficient for two meals";
and according to others R. Gidel said in the name of Rabh (not two meals
of herbs only but) sufficient wine to soak the herbs which are usually
eaten in two meals.

R. Zera said in the name Of Samuel: "It is allowed to make an Erub with
beer, but if three lugs of it be poured into a Mikvah, the Mikvah
becomes invalid." How much beer is necessary for an Erub? R. Ahu the son
of R. Joseph wished to

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

state in the presence of his father, that two lugs were necessary,
*i.e.*, one lug for each meal. Said R. Joseph: This is not so. There are
men who drink only one goblet-full in the morning and another in the
evening (a goblet-full is supposed to be a quarter of a lug); hence two
goblets-full are sufficient for an Erub.

What is the quantity of dates sufficient for an Erub? Said R. Joseph:
"One Kabh." What is the quantity of Sheshitha (a dish made of parched
corn and honey)? Said R. A'ha bar Pinhas: Two spoons-full. What is the
quantity of roasted ears (of corn)? Said Abaja: Two bunis (measures used
in the city of Pumbaditha).

Abayi said again: "My mother told me, that roasted ears are good for the
heart and drive away care." He said again: My mother told me, that one
who has heart-disease should take the meat from the right shoulder of a
ram, bring some willow branches, burn them, and roast the meat on the
coals. Then he should eat the meat and drink wine thinned with water.

Said R. Jehudah in the name of Samuel: "Of all things that are eaten
with bread it is sufficient to use a quantity eaten with bread at two
meals; but of such things as are eaten by themselves sufficient for two
meals must be used for an Erub. Of raw meat sufficient for two meals if
eaten by itself must be used, but of cooked meat Rabba said it is
sufficient to use as much as is eaten with bread at two meals, and R.
Joseph said as much as is eaten at two meals by itself should be used,
and he said: "Whence do I adduce this? Because I saw that the Persians
eat roasted meat without bread." Rejoined Abayi: Are the Persians the
majority of the whole world?

R. Hyya bar Ashi said in the name of Rabh: "An Erub may be made with raw
meat." R. Simi bar Hyya said: "An Erub may be made with raw eggs." And
how many should be used? Said R. Na'hman bar Itz'hak: "Sinai <span
id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md) said, two eggs should be used."

R. Huna in the name of Rabh said: If one vowed, that he would not eat
this loaf of bread, an Erub may nevertheless be made for him with that
loaf; because though he must not eat it, others may. If he says,
however, that this loaf is on him, *i.e.*, he devotes this loaf of bread
(in honor of the Lord), it must not be used for an Erub.

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

An objection was made: If one vowed concerning a certain loaf of bread,
an Erub may nevertheless be made with it. Shall we not assume that he
said: "This loaf of bread is on me"? (*i.e.*, he devoted that loaf of
bread in honor of the Lord). Nay; be said: "I vow not to eat this loaf
of bread," and such seems to be the case; because the latter part of the
Boraitha states distinctly, that he said: "I vow not to taste any part
of this loaf." What is the law, however, if the man said that the loaf
is on him? It must not be used for an Erub? If that is so, why was it
taught in the latter part of the Boraitha: "If he said the loaf is
consecrated, an Erub must not be made with it, because it is not allowed
to make an Erub with consecrated things." Why should this whole argument
be repeated? Could it not be simply stated, that if the man vows not to
eat the loaf an Erub may be made with it; but if he declares the loaf to
be on him, an Erub must not be made with it? But as it does not say,
that the loaf is on him in the first part of the Boraitha, there is a
contradiction to R. Huna? R. Huna said the same thing as R. Eliezer said
elsewhere. Did R. Eliezer indeed say so? Did we not learn, that R.
Eliezer said: "If a man said: 'This loaf of bread is on me,' an Erub may
be made with it, but if he said, 'This loaf is consecrated,' it must not
be used for an Erub, because an Erub must not be made with consecrated
things"? There are two Tanaim who report the dictum of R. Eliezer in
different ways.

"*An Erub may be made for a Nazarite with wine*." This Mishna is not in
accordance with the opinion of Beth Shammai, as we have learned in the
following Boraitha: An Erub must not be made for a Nazarite with wine,
nor for an ordinary Israelite with heave-offering. So said Beth Shammai;
Beth Hillel, however, said: "This may be done." Said Beth Hillel to Beth
Shammai: "Will ye not admit, that an Erub may be made for a man who is
obliged to fast on the Day of Atonement, although he must not eat it?"
They answered: "Yea." "Then," rejoined Beth Hillel, "as we are permitted
to make an Erub for a man fasting on the Day of Atonement, so may we
also make an Erub for a Nazarite with wine, and for an ordinary
Israelite with heave-offering." What reason have Beth Shammai for
prohibiting this? They give as their reason the fact, that a man may eat
the Erub while it is yet day (before the eve of the Day of Atonement);
but a Nazarite must not at any time drink wine nor an ordinary Israelite
eat heave-offering.

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

This whole Boraitha is not in accordance with the teachings of Hananiah,
as we have learned in the following Boraitha: "Beth Shammai do not
recognize an Erub unless a man carries out his bed and all the utensils
he intends to use to the place where he proposes to make the Erub, so
taught Hananiah."

According to whose opinion is the Boraitha which states, that a man who
deposits his Erub while wearing a black garment must not go out on the
morrow dressed in a white garment, and *vice versa*? Said R. Na'hman bar
Itz'hak: This is in accordance with the opinion of Beth Shammai as
interpreted by Hananiah.

"*Symmachus said: 'Unconsecrated things only may be used*,'" etc.
Consequently Symmachus does not dissent as regards making an Erub for a
Nazarite with wine, but does dissent as regards heave-offering for the
Erub of an ordinary Israelite. Why is this so? Because a Nazarite may go
to a sage and be declared free from his vows as a Nazarite. As regards
heave-offering for the Erub of an ordinary Israelite, he holds with the
Rabbis, who decreed, that all things which are prohibited by rabbinical
law on account of the Sabbath-rest are also prohibited for the time of
twilight, and as regards heave-offering, an ordinary Israelite must not
handle it on Sabbath on account of Sabbath-rest.

According to whose opinion is the following Mishna? There are sages who
hold, that the prescribed quantities, which are dependent upon the size
of a man, should be measured accordingly. And the two meals which must
be constituted by the Erub, should be two meals sufficient for the man
who deposits the Erub? Said R. Zera: "This is according to Symmachus,
who holds, that an Erub must be according to the requirements of the man
for whom it is made."

"*The Erub of a priest may be placed on a spot which had formerly been
used as a cemetery*." R. Jehudah bar Ami said in the name of R. Jehudah,
that a spot which had formerly been used as a cemetery becomes clean of
itself if trodden down by people.

"*R. Jehudah said: 'It may be placed in an actual burying-ground.'*" It
was taught: Because the priest can go there in a wagon; for R. Jehudah
holds, that a temporary tent is sufficient to intervene between a man
and uncleanness. Furthermore we have learned that for a ritually clean
priest, clean heave-offering may be placed as an Erub even in a grave
and for the same reason as above, in spite of the fact that the
heave-offering becomes unclean and the priest is at no time allowed to
eat it.

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

MISHNA: For the Erub doubtful grain (Damai) (of which it is not known
whether the legal dues like tithes, etc., have been acquitted) may be
used; first tithes, from which the heave-offerings have been taken; and
second tithes and consecrated things that have been redeemed. For
priests, the first of the dough and heave-offerings may be used. It is
not lawful however to use unseparated grain (from which it is certain
that the legal dues have not been separated), or first tithes from which
the heave-offering had not been taken, or second tithes and consecrated
things which had not been redeemed.

GEMARA: \[The reasons for the above Mishna and the discussions appear
several times throughout the Talmud. We shall render them, however, but
once and that in Tract Berachoth (benedictions), which contains the
complete and identical version.\]

MISHNA: Should a man send his Erub by the hand of a deaf and dumb
person, an idiot, a minor or one who does not acknowledge the legal
necessity of an Erub, it is not a valid Erub; if, however, he had
commissioned another proper person to receive it from his messenger, it
is a valid Erub.

If a man puts the Erub in a tree higher than ten spans above ground, it
is not valid; but if he puts it lower than ten spans, it is. If he had
put it into a pit, even though it be a hundred ells deep, the Erub is
valid.

GEMARA: By the hand of a minor it would not be a valid Erub? Did not R.
Huna say, that a minor may collect the Erub? This presents no
difficulty. R. Huna's dictum refers to an Erub of courts (where only the
meal is to be gathered in order to make common cause), but our Mishna
refers to an Erub of limits (where a man must go and declare his
intention of making that his resting-place for the Sabbath).

"*One who does not acknowledge the legal necessity of an Erub*." Who is
meant thereby? Said R. Hisda, a Samaritan.

"*If, however, he had commissioned another person*," etc. Why! Perhaps
the above messenger will not deliver it! As R. Hisda said elsewhere,
that he should stand and see the messenger depart, so must he also do in
this case. Still there is fear that the person commissioned to receive
it from the messenger will not receive it? As R. Yechiel said elsewhere,
that it is an established rule, that if a messenger has been intrusted
with an errand, it is presumed that he will perform the errand and this
must also be assumed in the case under consideration. Where did R. Hisda
and R. Yechiel make these statements? Concerning

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

the following Boraitha, which teaches, that if a man sent his Erub
through a trained elephant or a trained monkey and they deposited the
Erub, ii is not valid, but if he had commissioned a person to receive it
from them and deposit it, it is valid. The same question arose here
which led to the statements of R. Hisda and R. Yechiel as stated above.

R. Na'hman said: The established rule, that a messenger will perform his
errand, holds good where rabbinical laws are concerned, but not where
biblical commandments are to be executed.

R. Shesheth, however, said: There is no difference. This rule holds good
even where biblical commandments are concerned.

"*If a man put his Erub in a tree*," etc. R. Hyya bar Abba, R. Assi and
Rabha bar Nathan sat together, and R. Na'hman sat near them. They were
deliberating upon the question of where the tree spoken of in the Mishna
was situated. Should we assume that it was standing in private ground,
what difference does it make whether the Erub was put lower or higher;
for private ground reaches even to the sky? Should we assume, that the
tree was in public ground, where was the man's intention to rest on this
tree; if on the top, why was the Erub which was placed above ten spans
not valid? The man and the Erub would be in one place? We must say, that
the man's intention was to rest at the foot of the tree (and if the Erub
was placed above ten spans from the ground it is not valid, because at
that height the tree becomes private ground by virtue of its being over
four spans wide, while the foot of the tree is still public ground and
consequently, the man would have to carry his food from private into
public ground on Sabbath and that is prohibited). Still, will he not
make use of a tree on the Sabbath and that is also prohibited? We must
therefore assume, that the Mishna means that the tree was standing in
public ground and it is according to Rabbi, who holds, that all
rabbinical ordinances enacted on account of the
[Sabbath](errata.htm#6)-rest (Shvuth.md) have no significance during
twilight (before or after the Sabbath). Said R. Na'hman: "I thank ye,
for so also did Samuel say." And they rejoined: "Was it so difficult for
you to understand the Mishna, that you thank us for our opinion. \[Did
they not themselves argue and discuss the matter? Nay; they spoke thus
to R. Na'hman.\] Would you insert our opinion in the Gemara explaining
this Mishna?" He answered: "Yea."

Rabha maid: All this refers to a tree, which was standing outside

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

of the addition (of 70 2/3 ells square) to a town; but if the tree was
standing inside of the addition to the town, it makes no difference
where the Erub was placed on it, even at a height of over ten spans,
because the atmosphere of a town pervades all the trees and it makes no
difference where the man takes his rest.

Where is the opinion of Rabbi and the sages to be found concerning the
twilight as mentioned above? In the following Boraitha.. If a man placed
his Erub on a tree ten spans above the ground, the Erub is not valid. If
placed lower than ten spans it is valid, but must not be taken down; if
it was placed within three spans from the ground it is valid and may
also be taken down. If the Erub, however, was placed in a basket and
then hung on the tree even at a height of over ten spans it is valid;
such is the dictum of Rabbi; the sages however say, that where an Erub
must not be taken down, it is also not valid. (Hence the difference of
opinion between Rabbi and the sages.) Concerning what part do they
differ? Shall we say, that they differ concerning the last part (*i.e.*,
where the Erub was placed in a basket and hung up on a tree at a height
of over ten spans, and the sages say therefore, that such an Erub is
invalid because the tree will have to be used on Sabbath and that is
prohibited), can we say, that incidental use of the tree is also
prohibited? (We know that is not so.) Shall we say, that they differ
concerning the first part (*i.e.*, where the Erub was placed at a height
of over ten spans and must not be taken down), we must first see what
kind of a tree is under consideration. If it be a tree of less than four
spans' width, it is a free place (not subject to jurisdiction), then why
should the Erub not be taken down? If it be a tree that was four spans
wide, it is regarded as private ground, then of what benefit is the
basket which contains the Erub (it must also be taken down from private
into public ground); said R. Jeremiah: "With a basket it is different.
It need not be taken down at all, but can be bent over and the Erub may
be removed." (Although the tree is private ground, when the basket is
bent over so that it is below ten spans it is no longer in private
ground.)

R. Papa sat in the college and repeated the above Halakha. Rabh bar Shva
raised an objection: "We have learned in a following Mishna: "But how
must this be done? One carries out the Erub, where he means to deposit
it on the eve of the first day of rest and remains with it until dusk,
when he carries it back with him." If thou sayest then, that it is
sufficient if he

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

hangs up a basket on the tree, because he can bend over the basket and
bring it lower than ten spans, why should the Mishna quoted order, that
the man must carry out the Erub, etc., and remain with it until dusk; it
may just as well say, that as he can remain until dusk and carry it
back, that it is sufficient, if he deposits it and carries it back with
him at once.

Said R. Zera: This is only a precautionary measure for a case where a
festival follows a Sabbath. (If it were said, that the man need not go
out and deposit his Erub, wait until dusk and carry it back, then go out
again on the next day and wait until dusk and eat the Erub, but that he
may leave it there because he could have done as the Mishna states and
the capability of performing an act is equivalent to its
performance,--it would be wrong; for the day being Sabbath he would not
have been permitted to carry it out again. Hence the precautionary
measure was made to apply to all similar cases.)

"*If he had put it into a pit*," etc. Where is the pit supposed to be
situated? If in private ground it is self-evident? For in the same
manner as private ground has no limit as to height it also has none as
to depth. If in public ground, the question arises, where the man
intended to take his Sabbath-rest? If he intended to take it outside of
the pit, he would be in one place and his Erub in another, and if he
intended to take his rest inside of the pit, it is self-evident that he
may deposit his Erub therein. We must say then, that the pit was
situated in unclaimed ground (in a valley) where he intended to rest.
The pit however being over ten spans deep is private ground, and as for
carrying from private into unclaimed ground the opinion of Rabbi again
prevails, that such acts as are prohibited on the Sabbath are not
prohibited for twilight on account of the Sabbath-rest.

MISHNA: If the man should put the Erub on top of a cane or pole, that
does not actually grow out of the ground, but is merely stuck in the
ground, even though it be a hundred ells high, it is a valid Erub.

If one put it into a cupboard which he locked and then lost the key, the
Erub is nevertheless valid. R. Eliezer said: If he does not know where
the key is, the Erub is not valid.

GEMARA: R. Ada bar Massne propounded a contradictory question to Rabha:
If the man should put his Erub on top of a cane, that does not actually
grow out of the ground, it is valid; but if the cane were a growing one,
the Erub would not be valid, because the tree would be handled thereby
and that is not permitted;

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

then this would be in accordance with the opinion of the sages; while
the previous Mishnaoth were according to Rabbi's opinion? This was
already asked by Rami bar Hama of R. Hisda and the latter answered, that
the previous two Mishnaoth were in accordance with Rabbi's opinion,
while this Mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the sages.

Rabhina, however, said, that this Mishna is also in accordance with
Rabbi's opinion, but here the precautionary measure is enacted, lest the
man might break down the cane if it grew out of the ground, while a tree
is too stout to be broken down, and in this case Rabbi concurs with the
sages.

One Friday, a military garrison came to Neherdai and occupied the city,
so that there was no room for the college of R. Na'hman. Said R. Na'hman
to his disciples: "Go out into the field and incline the growing bushes
towards each other, so that we have room enough to study in to-morrow."
So Rami bar Hama, according to another version, Uqba bar Ada objected:
"Did we not learn in this Mishna, that an Erub must not be put on
growing stalks or cane?" Answered R. Na'hman: The Mishna refers to
brittle (withered) cane, but as for healthy (moist) bushes it is not
prohibited.

"*If one put it into a cupboard, etc., and lost the key*." Why should
the Erub be valid? The man is in one place and the Erub in another? He
cannot even obtain it without a key. Rabh and Samuel both said, that the
Erub is valid only when the cupboard is not firmly immured but is
loosely built, so that the bricks maybe removed and the Erub taken out,
and that the Mishna is according to R. Meir's opinion, who holds, that
this may be done on a festival to commence with and that the Mishna
refers to a festival only, and not on a Sabbath. If this be so, how will
the following clause of the Mishna be explained: "R. Eliezer said: If
the key be lost in the city, the Erub is valid, but if lost in the
field, it is not valid." If the Mishna refers to a festival, what
difference does it make where the key was lost. Carrying is not
prohibited on a festival? The Mishna is not complete and should read
thus: If one put it into a cupboard, which he locked and then lost the
key, the Erub is nevertheless valid, providing it was a festival. On
Sabbath, however, it is not valid. If the key was subsequently found,
whether in the city or in the field, the Erub is nevertheless not valid.
R. Eliezer, however, said: If it was found in the city, the Erub is
valid, because he holds to R. Simeon's opinion, who said, that

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

all the courts and wood-sheds in the city are as one ground and the key
could be brought through them; but if found in the field it could not be
carried.

Rabba and R. Joseph both said: "Our Mishna treats of a wooden cupboard
and the Tana who holds that if the key was lost, the Erub was valid,
considers the cupboard the same as a vessel which may be taken apart on
the Sabbath and the Erub taken out, while R. Eliezer considers the
cupboard the same as a tent which must not be taken apart on the
Sabbath." How can they differ as to its being a vessel or a tent? If it
was large all agree, that it is a tent, and if it was small all agree,
that it is a vessel? Therefore Abayi and Rabha both say, that the Mishna
treats of a case where the key was tied to the lock by a string, which
could not be undone by hand. The first Tana holds according to R. Jose,
that all vessels may be handled on the Sabbath for any purposes whatever
(hence a knife used for cutting bread may be used to cut the string),
whereas R. Eliezer holds according to the opinion of R. Nehemiah, who
decrees, that all vessels may be handled on Sabbath only for the
purposes for which they are intended.

MISHNA: Should the Erub roll (or be moved) out of the limit of the
Sabbath distance, should a heap of mould fall on it, or should it be
burned, or if the heave-offering (used for the Erub) became unclean, and
any or all of this take place while it is yet day (*i.e.*, before the
Sabbath set in) the Erub is not valid. If it take place, however, after
dusk (when it is already Sabbath) the Erub is valid. If the time when it
took place is doubtful, R. Meir and R. Jehudah both say: This is (like
driving) an ass and (leading) a camel (meaning, that a man is hemmed in
on all sides). R. Jose and R. Simeon say: A doubtful Erub is valid? R.
Jose further said: Abtolymus attested upon the authority of five elders,
that a doubtful Erub is valid.

GEMARA: Said Rabha: (If the Erub rolled outside of the limit of the
Sabbath distance) for a distance of over four ells it is not valid; but
if it rolled for less than four ells, the man who deposited the Erub is
allowed four ells to move in, outside of the limits, consequently the
Erub is valid.

"*Should a heap of mould fall on it*," etc. At a casual glance it was
assumed, that the Erub could have been extracted from under the heap of
mould by hand, and accordingly the Mishna was in conformity with the
opinion of Rabbi, that at twilight such acts as are prohibited by
rabbinical law on account of the

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sabbath-rest may
be performed; subsequently, however, the conclusion was arrived at, that
the Mishna is in accordance with Rabbi's opinion, and that the Erub in
this instance could not be extracted by hand but by means of a hoe.

It was necessary to insert both clauses (concerning the rolling of the
Erub and its being buried beneath a heap of mould) in the Mishna and for
the reason; that, were the first clause only inserted, one might say:
"If the Erub rolled out beyond the limits, it was no more in its place
and hence it is invalid; but if it was simply buried beneath a heap of
mould it is still in its proper place and why should it not be valid?"
If the latter clause only had been inserted, one might say: "In this
case the Erub was buried and could not be seen, hence it is invalid, but
if it merely rolled out and can be seen, the same wind might bring it
back, why should it not be valid?" For this reason it was necessary to
mention both cases.

"*Or should it be burned, or if the heave-offering (used as an Erub)
became unclean*," etc. The ordinance referring to an Erub which was
burned up is taught in order to show the firmness of R. Jose, who
declares, that (if a doubt existed whether the Erub was burned before or
after dusk) although the Erub is no longer in existence, it is still
valid, and the ordinance referring to heave-offering which became
unclean was taught to show the firmness of R. Meir, who maintains that
although the heave-offering was still there and only a doubt existed as
to whether it became unclean before or after dusk, the Erub is
nevertheless invalid. Is it possible, that R. Meir holds a doubtful case
based upon rabbinical law to necessitate the more rigorous decision? R.
Meir holds, that the law pertaining to Sabbath-limits is biblical. Does
R. Meir indeed hold thus? Have we not learned in a Mishna further on
(Chapter V., Mishna 3), that R. Meir maintains, when measurements are
made to determine the Sabbath-limit and mountains are encountered that
it is permitted to cut straight through the mountains (in an imaginary
sense or figuratively speaking), and such subterfuges are certainly not
allowed where biblical laws are concerned?

The latter opinion while credited to R. Meir is not in reality his own,
but the opinion of his teacher, while the former is his own conviction
and the proof is, that the Mishna quoted states distinctly: R. Dostai
ben Janai said: I have *upon the authority* of R. Meir, etc.

We have learned in a Boraitha: How should the dictum of

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

R. Jose to the effect, that "a doubtful Erub is valid" be explained?
Thus: If an Erub was made with heave-offering concerning which there was
a doubt whether it became unclean while it was yet day, or after dusk,
or with fruit concerning which there was a doubt whether the tithes had
been acquitted while it was yet day or after dusk, it constitutes a
doubtful Erub, which is nevertheless valid; if, however, the Erub was
effected with heave-offering concerning which there was a doubt whether
it was clean or unclean to commence with, or with fruit concerning which
there was a doubt whether tithes had been acquitted at all, it does not
constitute a doubtful Erub, which *is* valid.

Let us see! Why is it said, that heave-offering, concerning which there
was a doubt whether it became unclean before or after dusk, would
constitute a doubtful Erub which was nevertheless valid, because the
heave-offering is presumed to be in its original condition and that was
certainly clean, why should not the same case apply to the fruit
concerning which there was a doubt, whether tithes had been acquitted
thereof or not, let the fruit also be presumed to be in its original
condition and that is unseparated (of which tithes had *not* been
acquitted)? Do not say, therefore, that the fruit was doubtful as to its
having been separated but say: there was a doubt whether it had not
subsequently been mixed with other (unseparated) fruit before or after
dusk.

R. Samuel bar R. Itz'hak asked of R. Huna: If there were two loaves of
bread before a man, one of which was clean and the other unclean and he
said: "Make an Erub for me with the clean loaf wherever it may be"; but
did not know which was which. \[If both loaves which were
heave-offerings, were used in making the Erub; for if they were ordinary
and even (ritually) unclean they may be eaten by an ordinary
Israelite\], what is the law according to the diverse opinions?
According to R. Meir, who pronounced a doubtful Erub invalid in a case
where the entire Erub would have been unclean, it may be said, that in
this case, where one of the loaves was positively clean, he may hold the
Erub to be valid; or according to R. Jose, who pronounces a doubtful
Erub valid in a case where if it *is* clean, he can distinguish it, it
may be said, that in this case the Erub, would in his opinion be invalid
because although part of it is clean, he cannot distinguish it from the
unclean?

R. Huna answered: According to both R. Meir and R. Jose, when the Erub
is deposited (while it is yet day) it must be

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

fit to eat and in this case it could not be eaten to commence with,
because, the clean could not be distinguished from the unclean, how then
could an Erub be made therewith?

Rabha asked of R. Na'hman: If a man say: "This loaf of bread is to-day
ordinary but to-morrow it shall be consecrated. Nevertheless make me an
Erub therewith." What is the law? (Does it become consecrated at
twilight and, as it is not permitted to make an Erub with consecrated
things, it is not valid as an Erub, or does it become consecrated after
twilight?) "The Erub is valid," was the answer. What is the law,
however, if the man say: "To-day this loaf is consecrated, but tomorrow
it shall be ordinary (*i.e.*, it shall be redeemed by a sum of money
representing its value); nevertheless make me an Erub therewith?" "The
Erub is not valid," was the answer. What is the difference between the
two cases? Said R. Na'hman to Rabha: "If thou wilt measure a whole Kur
of salt and present me with it, <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md) I
shall tell thee the answer: If the loaf of bread was ordinary when it
was deposited as an Erub, the fact, that at twilight it becomes
doubtful, whether it is consecrated or not, does not destroy its
validity as a legal Erub, but if the loaf of bread was deposited while
yet consecrated, the doubt existing at twilight whether it had already
become ordinary does not nullify its sanctity as a consecrated object,
and as a consecrated object cannot be deposited as an Erub, the validity
of the Erub, is impaired."

MISHNA: A man may make his Erub, conditional and say: If foes come from
the east, my Erub shall be valid for the west; should they come from the
west, my Erub shall be good for the east; should they come from both
sides, I am at liberty to go in what direction I please; should they not
come from either side, I am like the rest of my townsmen. Should a sage
come from the east, my Erub shall be valid for the east; should one come
from the west, my Erub shall be valid for the west; should one come from
each side, I am at liberty to go in which direction I please; should
none come from either side, I am like the rest of my townsmen. R.
Jehudah. said: If one of the two sages (should they come at the same
time) had been the man's teacher, he must go to meet his teacher; if
both had been his teachers, he may go in which direction he pleases.

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

GEMARA: "*R. Jehudah said: 'If one of the two sages*,'" etc. What is the
reason of the dissension of the sages from R. Jehudah's opinion? Because
it frequently happens, that a man has a greater fondness for his
colleague than for his teacher.

Rabh said: This part of the Mishna (wherein R. Jehudah states, that "if
both sages had been the man's teachers, he may go in whichever direction
he pleases") does not hold good, because Ayo taught: R. Jehudah said: "A
man cannot make an object conditional upon two contingencies and in this
case of the Erub he may make it conditional upon the arrival of a sage
from either the west or the east, but not upon sages arriving from
opposite directions." Why can he not make it conditional upon the
arrival of sages from opposite directions? Because R. Jehudah does not
admit of the theory of premeditated choice (*i.e.*, he does not consent
to a man deciding upon a certain thing on one day and declaring that it
had been his intention to decide in that manner since the day before),
hence if two sages come from opposite directions, the man cannot say,
that he had intended to meet the sage towards whom he went at the time
he deposited the Erub, *i.e.*, on the day before.

If R. Jehudah does not hold to the theory of premeditated choice why
does he consent to a man making an Erub and saying: "If the sage come
from the east, my Erub shall be good for the east, and if from the west,
for the west." His choice is certainly dependent upon two conditions;
first the condition, that the sage will come from either one of two
directions, and second, that he may not come at all, in which case his
Erub is of no account. If the sage arrived on the morrow, and the man
will go forward to meet him, he (the man) will be compelled to claim a
premeditated choice saying, that he had intended when depositing his
Erub to go in that direction and that would be incorrect; for it may be,
that at the time the Erub was made, the sage himself did not know from
which direction he would come.

Said R. Johanan: The statement of Ayo in the name of R. Jehudah, that a
man may make his Erub conditional upon the arrival of a sage from the
east or west holds good, only if the sage had already started on his way
and was no more than four thousand ells away from the man \[*i.e.*, if
he or his Erub was at the time when the man deposited his Erub already
within the legal limit established through the deposition of his (the
sage's) own Erub\]. Hence it was not a premeditated choice on the

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

part of the man dependent upon the two conditions cited, for the sage
was already on his way and his coming from a certain direction was an
accomplished fact.

Why does Rabh say, that the Mishna does not hold good because of Ayo's
statement? Let him say on the contrary, that Ayo's statement does not
hold good, because the Mishna opposes it? Nay; it would not be proper;
for we have learned elsewhere, that R. Jehudah does not hold to the
theory of premeditated choice. Ula, however, declares, that Ayo's
statement should be discountenanced on account of the Mishna (and as for
the report, that R. Jehudah discards the theory of premeditated choice,
Ula declares, that on the contrary, he holds it to be good).

Said Rabha to R. Na'hman: Who is the Tana, who holds, that the sages
also discountenance the theory of premeditated choice? For we have
learned as follows: If one man said to five others: "I will make an Erub
for any one of you whom I may choose, and if I desire, he shall be
permitted to go within its limits, and if not, he must not do so." If he
made his decision, while it was yet day (before the Sabbath set in) his
Erub is valid; but if he made his decision after dark, his Erub is not
valid, (because it was not known at twilight which man he had chosen).
R. Na'hman was silent and did not answer.

Should he have said, that this was according to the school of Ayo? He
had not heard of Ayo's decree. Said R. Joseph: Wouldst thou ignore the
other Tanaim? There are other Tanaim who dispute the above decision, as
we have learned: If a man said: "I will make an Erub for all the
Sabbaths of the ensuing year. If I then choose to go, I shall do so, and
if not, I shall not." If he made his decision while it was yet day on
the day preceding Sabbath, he may go, but if he made his decision after
dusk, R. Simeon says, his Erub is still valid, and the sages say, it is
not. (Hence there are sages who do not hold to the theory of
premeditated choice.)

Have we not heard elsewhere, that R. Simeon does not hold to the theory
of premeditated choice? This would be a contradiction made by R. Simeon
to himself? Therefore learn to the contrary: (R. Simeon says, the Erub
is not valid, and the sages say it is.) Why this question? Can it not
be, that R. Simeon does not hold the theory of premeditated choice to be
good where biblical laws are concerned but does hold the theory good for
rabbinical laws? R. Joseph maintains, that one who admits

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

of the theory of premeditated choice does so for both biblical and
rabbinical laws, and one who discountenances the theory does so for
*both* kinds of laws.

MISHNA: R. Eliezer said: When a festival precedes or succeeds a Sabbath
(by one day), a man should prepare two Erubin and say: My first Erub is
to be valid for the east and my second for the west; or my first for the
west and the second for the east. My Erub is valid for the first day and
the second day I am like the rest of my townsmen, or my Erub is good for
the second day and the first day I am like my townsmen. The sages
however hold, that one may prepare his Erub for one direction only;
otherwise it is not valid at all; also that he must prepare his Erub for
both days, or it is not valid at all. But how must this be done? One
carries out the Erub to the place, where he means to deposit it on the
eve of the first day of rest and remains with it until dusk, when he
carries it back with him. He then brings the Erub out again on the
second day, remains with it till dark and then cats it and goes away. It
is obvious, that in this manner he gains his walk beyond the Sabbatical
limit and he gains by eating his Erub. Should his Erub have been eaten
on the first day, it is a legal Erub for the first day only; but not for
the second day. R. Eliezer said to them: "Thus ye acknowledge to me that
they are two distinct holidays (*i.e.*, that the sanctification of one
day is not equal to that of the other)."

GEMARA: What do the sages mean to tell us: If a man prepares his Erub
for one direction, it is good for both days and if he prepares it for
both days it is good for one direction? What need is there of this
repetition, is it not one and the same thing? Nay; the sages mean to say
to R. Eliezer: "Wilt thou not acknowledge, that it is not permitted to
make two Erubin for one day, one of which shall be good for the South
for one half of the day and the other be good for the North for the
other half of the day?" and he answered: "Yea." "Then," rejoined the
sages, "in the same manner as *this* is not permitted, it is also not
allowed to make Erubin good for both days, which should in addition be
also good on one day for the east and on the other for the west." \[What
answer could R. Eliezer make to this? He might say, that in the case of
the two Erubin for one day, the sanctification of that one day continues
throughout the entire time of the validity of the Erub, whereas in the
case of the Erubin for both days, the sanctification of the one day
(Sabbath) is not the same as that of the other day (the festival);

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

therefore a separate Erub may be made for each sanctification in a
different direction.\] Said R. Eliezer to the sages again: "Let us
suppose now, that a man did not make an Erub, but on the eve of the
first day went to the place, where he should have made it, personally
and declared that he would take his Sabbath-rest there. Would this hold
good also for the second day? Nay, he would have to return on the
following day and again declare his intention of resting there the next
day, and then it would be lawful? The same theory applies to an Erub. If
he deposited it on the eve of the first day, and it had been eaten when
deposited, he would have to make another Erub for the second day?" and
they answered, "Yea." "Now will ye not acknowledge that the two days
have each a separate degree of sanctification?"

\[What reply can the sages make to this? They may declare that the fact
of there being a distinct degree of sanctification for each day is
rather doubtful to them and for that reason they desire to enforce the
more rigorous interpretation of the ordinance both ways, namely, that an
Erub must not be made for each of the two directions, lest there be but
one degree of sanctification for both days and that one Erub cannot
serve for both days, lest there be a different degree of sanctification
for each day.\]

Again the sages said to R. Eliezer: "How is it, if no Erub at all was
made on the eve of the first day? Thou wilt acknowledge that a man
cannot go and make an Erub on the eve of the second day?" and he
answered, "Yea." "Then," rejoined the sages, "thou thereby dost admit,
that there is but one degree of sanctification for both days." \[What
will R. Eliezer say to this? He will say, on the contrary, that there
*are* two degrees of sanctification and just for that reason one must
not make the Erub on the eve of the second day, because one must not
prepare for a festival on the Sabbath or *vice versa*.\]

The Rabbis taught: "If one made an Erub on the eve of the first day by
means of his feet (*i.e.*, by standing at the place where he intends to
rest) he must do so again on the eve of the second day. If he made an
Erub (of victuals) on the eve of the first day and the Erub was
consumed, it does not hold good for the second day. Such is the dictum
of Rabbi. R. Jehudah, however, said. "This is like driving an ass and
leading a camel" (*i.e.*, R. Jehudah means to say this: If the two days
have but one degree of sanctification and the Erub was made for both
days,

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

the maker loses the two thousand ells in the opposite direction from
that towards which his Erub was made, and merely gains two thousand ells
in the one direction towards which his Erub was made. If the two days
have different degrees of sanctification and hence the Erub is valid
only for one day, the maker of the Erub should on the second day be on a
par with the rest of his townsmen, but in reality he only has two
thousand ells on the way back to the town and no more). R. Simeon ben
Gamaliel and R. Ishmael the son of R. Johanan ben Berokah, however, both
say, that if a man made an Erub with his feet on the eve of the first
day it suffices for the second day and if he made an Erub (of victuals)
on the eve of the first day and it was consumed, he is exempt from
making it on the eve of the second day. Said Rabh: "The Halakha prevails
according to the opinion of the four old sages and in conformity with R.
Eliezer, who says, that the two days have different degrees of
sanctification; and the four old sages are: R. Simeon ben Gamaliel, R.
Ishmael the son of R. Johanan ben Berokah, R. Elazar ben R. Simeon and
R. Jose ben R. Jehudah. The last of these is generally quoted by Rabbi
[anonymously](errata.htm#7.md) wherever his opinion seems to be justifiable
and according to another version, one of the four sages is R. Elazar ben
Samua instead of R. Jose ben R. Jehudah. Rabh's information on this
point was derived from a tradition, which was to the effect, that those
four sages held in accordance with R. Eliezer concerning the two degrees
of sanctification for both days.

R. Jehudah said: If one made an Erub on the eve of the first day with
his feet, he must do likewise on the eve of the second day, and if he
made an Erub on the eve of the first day with bread, he must make it in
like manner on the eve of the second day. If he made an Erub on the eve
of the first day with bread which was lost, he may make it on the eve of
the second day with his feet, but if he made it with his feet in the
first instance he must not make it with bread in the second instance,
because making an Erub with bread to commence with on Sabbath or on a
festival would be an infraction of the law prohibiting the preparing on
a Sabbath for a festival or *vice versa*. If a man made an Erub with
bread on the eve of the first day, he must make it with bread on the eve
of the second day also and, according to Samuel, he should use the same
bread in both cases (for if he uses new bread in the second instance it
will be a case of preparing on a Sabbath for a festival). Said R. Ashi:
We can adduce

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

this also from our Mishna, which teaches: "But how must this be done?
One carries out the Erub to the place, where he means to deposit it on
the eve of the first day of rest and remains with it until dusk, when he
carries it back with him; he then brings the Erub out again on the
second day, remains with it until dusk, then eats it and goes away."
(The fact that it says, "he carries it back with him and then brings it
out again," is proof that it must be the same Erub.) The sages that
differ with Samuel and assert that new bread may be used on the eve of
the second day maintain, that the Mishna merely administers good advice
and tells us, that we need not trouble ourselves to make a new Erub in
case the first one is lost.

MISHNA: R. Jehudah said: "If a man apprehend that the new year will be
celebrated two days, he must prepare two Erubin." He then says: My Erub
of the first day shall be valid for the east and of the second day for
the west; or of the first day for the west and of the second day for the
east. My Erub shall be valid for the first day, and on the second I am
like my townsmen; or my Erub shall be valid for the second day and on
the first I am like my townsmen. The sages however did not coincide with
him.

R. Jehudah further said: "A man may conditionally separate (the
heave-offering from) a basket of fruit on the first day of the new year
and eat it on the second day; likewise an egg which is laid on the first
day of the festival may be eaten on the second. The sages however do not
coincide with him.

R. Dosa ben Harchinas said: He who stands before the pulpit to pray on
the first day of the new year must say: Strengthen us, O Lord our God,
on this day of the new moon, whether to-day or to-morrow (be the true
day). And on the morrow he says the same prayer with the variation
"whether this day or yesterday be the true one." The sages, however, do
not agree with him.

GEMARA: Who are the sages, that do not coincide with R, Jehudah? Said
Rabh: That is R. Jose, as we have learned in a Boraitha: The sages agree
with R. Eliezer that "if a man apprehend that the new year will be
celebrated two days, <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) he

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

should prepare two Erubin. He then says: My Erub of the first day shall
be valid for the east and of the second day for the west; or of the
first day for the west and of the second day for the east. My Erub shall
be valid for the first day and on the second I am like my townsmen; or
my Erub shall be valid for the second day and on the first I am like my
townsmen." R. Jose, however, does not consent to this. (He holds that if
the witnesses come before the high court in the afternoon of the first
day that had been kept holy and declare that the next day is New Year,
both days are nevertheless holy and are of one degree of
sanctification.)

We have learned in a Boraitha: How does R. Jehudah explain his dictum,
that "a man may conditionally separate (the heave-offering from) a
basket of fruit on the first day of the New Year and eat it on the
second?" Thus: If there were two baskets of unseparated fruit before a
man on the first day of the New Year he may say: "If to-day is the
ordinary day and to-morrow is the holy day, let the heave-offering
separated from this basket of fruit also serve for the other, and if
to-day is the holy day and to-morrow the ordinary, then I have said
nothing." He then designates the fruit which he calls heave-offering and
lets it remain. On the morrow again he may say: If to-day is an ordinary
day, let the heave-offering of this basket also serve for the other, but
if to-day be a holy day I have said nothing. He may then designate part
of the fruit in the one basket and call it heave-offering and eat the
remainder in both baskets. R. Jose however prohibits this not only for
the two days of the new year but for the two days of every other
festival, which is celebrated in exile. <span

It happened that a stag was caught on the first day of a holiday (in
exile) at the house of the Exilarch and on the second day it was
slaughtered. R. Na'hman and R. Hisda partook of the stag, but R.
Shesheth would not do so. Said R. Na'hman: "What shall we do with R.
Shesheth who does not eat venison?" Rejoined R. Shesheth: "How can I eat
this venison; for did not Issi teach in a Boraitha \[or a Boraitha
taught, that Issi said\],

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

that R. Jose would not permit this to be done even during the two days
of a holiday in exile?"

Once R. Shesheth met Rabba bar Samuel and asked him: "Did master teach
anything regarding the sanctification of the holidays?" Answered Rabba:
"Yea, I taught in a Boraitha, that R. Jose coincides with the sages, as
far as the two days of a holiday in exile are concerned." Rejoined R.
Shesheth: "If thou shouldst meet any of the Exilarch's household, say
nothing to them about this Boraitha."

It once happened that herbs were brought to the city of Mehuzza on a
festival. Rabha went out and noticed, that the herbs were somewhat
withered. He permitted the herbs to be bought, saying: "It is obvious,
that these herbs were not gathered on this day, and the only objection
that might be made to their being purchased can be, that they were
brought from beyond the techoom (legal limits)." The law, however,
ordains, that if things are brought for one Israelite from without the
techoom, another Israelite may use them, and in this case, where the
herbs were brought even for the Gentile inhabitants they can in so much
greater a degree be used by Israelites. Subsequently, however, he
observed, that herbs were brought in large quantities, so he prohibited
the purchase of them on a festival.

The men whose occupation was to prepare baldachins for marriages once
cut off branches of myrtle on the second day of a holiday in exile. The
moment it became dark, Rabhina permitted the people to smell the myrtle.
Said Rabha bar Tachlipha to Rabhina: Master should have prohibited this,
for these people are ignorant (and if thou wilt permit this, they may
ignore the second day of the festival entirely). R. Shmaya opposed this:
"Thou sayest, because they are ignorant, and even were they intelligent
men, would it be allowed? Is it not necessary to allow sufficient time
after the Sabbath to expire until the branches can be cut off afresh?"
They finally went and asked Rabha and he decided that it was necessary
to allow sufficient time to expire until the branches could be cut anew.

"*R. Dosa ben Harchinas said*," etc. Said Rabba: When we were in the
college of R. Huna, a question was propounded by us as follows: "Must
the reference to the day of the new moon be added to the prayers recited
on the day of the New Year?" Shall we assume, that because there are
separate additional sacrifices for each, that the reference to the day
of the new moon shall be

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

added to the prayers of the New Year, or because the New Year is
mentioned in the prayer as the "day of Remembrance" such mention will
suffice for both occasions? R. Huna answered us by quoting the Mishna:
R. Dosa ben Harchinas said: He who stands before the pulpit to pray on
the first day of the New Year must say: "Strengthen us, O Lord our God,
on this day of the new moon, etc." Does not R. Dosa state this in order
to demonstrate that the day of the new moon must be explicitly
mentioned? Nay, he simply means to make the prayer conditional but not
because special mention must be made of the day of the new moon. It
seems to us, that such is truly the case, because further on the
Boraitha states, that so did R. Dosa act on all the days of the new moon
throughout the year; but the sages did not coincide with him.

Now, if it be said, that the prayer was made conditional it is correct,
(because there was a doubt concerning the exact day at each recurring
new moon) but if it be said, that the new moon must be mentioned in the
prayer *especially*, why should the sages not agree with him?

An objection was made: When New Year falls on a Sabbath, Beth Shammai
say, ten benedictions are to be recited during the prayer and Beth
Hillel say "only nine." \[The first three are benedictions of praise,
the last three benedictions of thanks; the Sabbath benediction, and the
three pertaining to New Year, viz., the one in which God is proclaimed
King (Malkhioth), the one referring to God's remembrance of his
creatures (Zikhronoth) and the one referring to the sounding of the
cornet (Shophroth), but according to Beth Hillel the Sabbath benediction
is included in those pertaining to the New Year, hence there are only
nine.\] Now if we say, that the benediction for the new moon must be
especially mentioned in the Musaph (additional prayer) then according to
Beth Shammai, there should be eleven benedictions in all.

Said R. Zera: "With the benediction of the new moon it is different;
because if the new moon fall on a Sabbath no separate benediction is
made, but it is included in the Sabbath benediction at the morning and
evening prayer; the benediction of the, new moon is also mentioned in
the Musaph-prayer in conjunction with the new year benediction." Do Beth
Shammai indeed maintain, that if the new moon fall on a Sabbath the
benediction pertaining to it is included in that of Sabbath? Have we not
learned, that if the new moon fall on Sabbath, Beth Shammai

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

hold, that eight benedictions must be recited in the prayer and Beth
Hillel only seven? This question is not decided.

Rabba said: "When I was at the college of R. Huna the question arose,
whether the benediction of the time <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md)
should be recited in the New Year and Day of Atonement prayers. Shall we
say, that because these holy days only come from time to time, the
benediction of time should be made, or, because the Bible does not
classify them as festivals, no such benediction need be made? R. Huna
could not answer the question but when I subsequently came to R.
Jehudah's college, the latter said he made such a benediction even over
a new pumpkin. I then said to him, that I did not question the right to
pronounce this benediction over anything whatever, but I wished to know
whether it was compulsory to do this on the New Year and the Day of
Atonement. He then answered: Rabh and Samuel both said, that the
benediction of time must be recited only for each of the three
festivals."

An objection was made: It is written \[Ecclesiastes xi. 2\]: "Give a
portion to seven, and also to eight." R. Eliezer said that by "seven" is
meant the seven days of the creation and by "eight" is meant the eight
days of the circumcision. R. Jehoshua said: "By 'seven' is meant the
seven days of Passover, by 'eight' is meant the eight days of the feast
of Tabernacles and by 'also' is meant Pentecost, New Year and the Day of
Atonement." May we not assume, that by this is meant, that the
benediction of time must be pronounced on all these festivals? Nay; this
simply means to state, that benedictions should be recited but no
special benedictions are specified. It seems to us, that this is the
correct explanation; for the benediction of time is certainly not
recited on every one of the days of the festivals but only the first
day. This is not the question, because the benediction of time must be
recited in the course of the festival; if not on the first day, on the
second and so on. At any event this benediction must be made over a
goblet (of wine)? Shall we assume, however, that the above is in support
of the dictum of R. Na'hman, who holds that the benediction of time may
be recited even in the market and without a goblet? This is not the
question either; for if a man does not recite this benediction

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

on one day, he may do so on the next when he might come across a goblet.
This would be feasible where the three (main) festivals and New Year are
concerned, but how would it be with the Day of Atonement? What should
the man do? Should he pronounce the benediction over the goblet on the
day preceding the Day of Atonement before dusk, he would then and there
usher in the Day of Atonement, and as is well known, he must not eat or
drink on that day. Should he pronounce the benediction and let the
goblet stand until after the Day of Atonement? Have we not learned that
one must drink the contents of the goblet immediately after pronouncing
the benediction; otherwise he must not make the benediction at all?
Should he pronounce the benediction and then give the goblet to a child?
In that case, there would be fear, lest the child be accustomed to
drinking on that day, and will continue to do so when grown and
therefore the Halakha according to R. A'ha does not prevail. How, then,
does the Halakha concerning the benediction of time on the New Year and
the Day of Atonement prevail? The Rabbis sent the elder R. Yeimar to R.
Hisda with instructions to observe how the latter proceeded on the eve
of the New Year, and then to return and report what he had seen. When R.
Hisda saw R. Yeimar (and upon questioning him as to his mission was told
that he just called to see him) he said: If a wet piece of wood is
lifted, it is obvious, that either the wood or its space is needed. (If
thou camest thou certainly didst so with an object.) At about that time
a goblet of wine was brought to R. Hisda and he pronounced the
benediction of the day and also that of the time over it.

The Halakha prevails, that the benediction of time must be recited on
the New Year and on the Day of Atonement and the Halakha also prevails
that if a man forgot to recite it and was reminded of his negligence
even in the market, he may recite it then and there.

Rabba said again: "When I was at the college of R. Huna, the question
arose whether a young scholar, who fasted on the day preceding Sabbath
must fast until night or in honor of the Sabbath break his fast earlier.
R. Huna could not answer the question. I went to R. Jehudah and he could
not answer this either." Said Rabha: "Let us see if we cannot decide
this question ourselves from what we have learned in the following
Boraitha: If the fast-day of the ninth of Abh fall on a Friday, bread
may be brought to a man just before twilight of the size

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

of an egg, and he should eat it, in order that he may not enter upon the
observance of the Sabbath while still in pain."

We have learned in a Boraitha: R. Jehudah said: It once happened that we
were sitting before R. Aqiba on the fast of the ninth of Abh, which fell
on a Friday, and just before dusk a soft-boiled egg was brought to him
which he swallowed without even salting it, and not because he desired
to eat it in that manner; but because he wished to show his disciples
how the Halakha was carried out. R. Jose, however, said, that a man must
fast through the entire day until dusk.

R. Jose said to the sages: "Will ye not admit, that if the ninth of Abh
fall on the day after Sabbath, a man must stop eating while it is yet
day on Sabbath?" and they answered "Yea." "What difference is there then
between entering in upon the observance of the Sabbath while still in
pain and finishing the Sabbath under the same conditions?" asked R.
Jose. They answered: "In the first instance he fasted all day; but in
this instance he had been eating and drinking all day and was surely not
in pain." Finally, however, Ula said that the Halakha prevailed
according to R. Jose.

Do we then act according to the opinion of R. Jose? Have we not learned,
(concerning the Boraitha in Tract Taanith which teaches) that Rabbon
Gamaliel said: "On a Friday the fast need not be completed," that upon
the death of Rabbon Gamaliel, R. Jehoshua came and sought to nullify his
decree and R. Johanan ben Nouri arose and declared: "We see that the
body always follows the head. As long as Rabbon Gamaliel lived, we
abided by his decisions. Now that he is dead, thou wouldst abolish them.
Jehoshua! We will not listen to thee. The Halakha prevailed according to
R. Gamaliel and so must it remain," and there was none to contradict R.
Johanan ben Nouri. (Thus we see, that the decree of R. Gamaliel was
accepted and not that of R. Jose.) (This is no question!) In the
generation of R. Gamaliel his decree was followed and in the generation
of R. Jose, R. Jose's opinion prevailed.

And did they really act in accordance with R. Gamaliel's opinion during
his generation? Have we not learned that R. Elazar ben Zadoc (who was
certainly of R. Gamaliel's day) said: I am a descendant of Sanab of the
tribe of Benjamin and it once happened that the ninth of Abh fell on a
Sabbath, so we postponed it until the following day and we did not
complete the fast because it was our holiday. Thus we see, that the fast
was not

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

completed because the tenth of Abh was a holiday and besides the
fast-day was a postponed one. Had the ninth of Abh however fallen on a
week-day, which for them would have been the eve of a festival, they
would have completed the fast nevertheless and this is not in conformity
with the decree of R. Gamaliel? Said Rabhina: How can ye compare that
festival to our festivals. Their festival was not biblical and on a
festival which is not biblical one may fast for three or four hours if
he chooses. On a biblical festival, however, it is not allowed to
complete the fast.

R. Joseph said: "I did not hear of this Halakha." Said Abayi: Thou didst
relate this to us thyself, in reference to the Boraitha, that a fast-day
must not be ordered on the days of the first of the month. (The occasion
when R. Joseph related this is mentioned in Tract Taanith.) Mar Zutra
related in the name of R. Huna: The Halakha prevails, that one may
complete the fast until dusk.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[85:1](eru07.htm#fr_28.md) The Israelites living in
exile were dependent for their information concerning the date of the
New Year entirely upon the messengers sent out by the high court in
Palestine, which in turn fixed the date upon the testimony of witnesses
who would announce when the new moon appeared (as explained in Tract
Rosh Hashana). Thus the exiled people did not know whether the 30th or
31st day from the first day of <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> Elul
would be proclaimed the first day of Tishri (the New Year), and both
were kept holy in consequence. For this reason the Mishna cites the
ordinances referring to such as apprehend that the New Year will last
two days.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[86:1](eru07.htm#fr_29.md) In exile the Israelites
celebrated two days each for the holidays of Passover, Tabernacles, and
Pentecost, besides the New Year, and these are called the holidays in
exile.
