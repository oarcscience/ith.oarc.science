# CHAPTER VII.

REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE PREPARATION OF ERUBIN FOR COURTS SEPARATED BY
APERTURES, WALLS, DITCHES, AND STRAW-RICKS. COMBINATION OF ERUBIN IN
ALLEYS.

MISHNA: If there be an aperture, four spans square, and less than ten
spans high (from the ground), between two courts, the inmates of each
court may prepare two separate Erubin; or if they prefer it, may combine
in one Erub. If the aperture be less than four spans square or over ten
spans from the ground, they are each obliged to prepare a separate Erub,
and must not combine in one.

GEMARA: Shall we say that this anonymous Mishna, is in accordance with
R. Simeon ben Gamaliel, who holds that the law of "lavud" (attached)
applies for a distance of less than four spans and not for a distance of
less than three spans as maintained by the sages? Nay; this Mishna may
be even in accordance with the opinion of the sages, for the question of
"lavud" does not arise here. It is merely a case of an aperture which is
less than four spans square, hence it is not considered a door and this
is admitted by the sages also, who hold that if an aperture is four
spans square or more, it is considered a door, but if less than four
spans square it is not.

"*If the aperture be less than four spans square*," etc. Why this
repetition? Is this not self-evident? The first clause of the Mishna
states, that if there be an aperture four spans square and less than ten
spans high from the ground, the inmates of the courts may either prepare
separate Erubin or combine in one. Hence if the aperture be less than
four spans square and more than ten spans high, it is obvious that they
cannot have their choice? The Mishna means to teach us, that if the
aperture was partly less than ten spans high from the ground and partly
more than ten spans high the inmates of the court still have their
choice of either making separate Erubin or combining in one, and only if
the entire aperture was over ten spans high

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

from the ground, they are obliged to make each a separate Erub.

This explanation of the Mishna has reference to the following teaching
of the Rabbis, viz.: If the entire aperture, with the exception of a
small part, was higher than ten spans from the ground (*e.g.*, if the
aperture was twelve spans square and was eight spans high from the
ground, thus two spans of the aperture were within ten spans from the
ground and ten spans were over ten spans from the ground), or if the
entire aperture with the exception of a small part was less than ten
spans from the ground (*e.g.*, if it was twelve spans square and only
two spans were over ten spans from the ground), the inmates of the
courts may either each make a separate Erub or combine in one. If the
entire aperture with the exception of a small part was higher than ten
spans from the ground the inmates have their choice; why is it necessary
to state, that if the entire aperture with the exception of a small part
was within ten spans from the ground, the inmates have their choice, is
this not self-evident? After having stated the law in the former case,
it applies the more to the latter.

R. Na'hman said: "The case of where the aperture is less than four spans
square or over ten spans from the ground, applies *only* to courts, but
as for houses, the aperture may be at any distance from the ground, even
over ten spans, and, nevertheless, the inmates are permitted to join in
an Erub." Why so? Because a house is considered solid, and every portion
is regarded as occupied.

R. Abba asked of R. Na'hman: "If in the attic of a house there was a
hole for the purpose of fastening a ladder therein, may the inmate of
the attic join in the Erub regardless of whether there was a ladder
fastened in the hole of the attic or not, *i.e.*, should the house be
considered solid and occupied and no ladder is necessary, or is the
house only considered solid as far as the walls are concerned but not
the interior, and a ladder is essential?" and he answered: "A ladder is
not necessary." R. Abba understood R. Na'hman to say, that a permanent
ladder was not necessary, but for the time that the Erub was to be
combined it was necessary. It was taught, however, by R. Joseph bar
Minyumi in the name of R. Na'hman that neither a permanent nor a
temporary ladder was necessary.

MISHNA: If there be a wall ten spans high and four spans wide between
two courts, the inmates of each must prepare separate

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

Erubin and must not join in one. If fruit happen to lie on the wall,
they may ascend from their respective sides and partake thereof,
provided they do not bring any of it down with them. Should there be a
breach in the wall, not wider than ten ells, they may prepare separate
Erubin or if they prefer it join in one, because the breach is
considered as a door. Should the breach, however, be wider than ten ells
they must both join in one Erub but must not prepare two separate
Erubin.

GEMARA: How is it, if the wall did not measure four spans in width? Said
Rabh: "In that case, the atmosphere of two separate premises
predominates at the wall and one must not handle anything even the size
of a hair lying on the wall." R. Johanan, however, says to the contrary:
"In that case the inmates of both courts may lay down fruit on the wall
(or even take it down from the wall because it is regarded as ground
under no jurisdiction)." R. Johanan will therefore explain the Mishna
thus: "If the wall was four spans wide it is permitted to ascend on
either side and partake of fruit lying on the wall, but it is not
permitted to bring up any. If, however, the wall was less than four
spans wide, one may carry fruit up on the wall and eat it there." This
statement of R. Johanan is but in accordance with his own theory, as
related by R. Dimi upon his arrival from Palestine in the name of R.
Johanan, viz.: "An object less than four spans square, standing between
public and private ground, may be used by both the occupants of the
public and private ground as an aid on which to shoulder a burden on the
Sabbath, but they should be careful not to confound the burdens placed
on the object so that a burden placed by an occupant of public ground be
taken up by an occupant of private ground and *vice versa*."

Can Rabh dispute this assertion of R. Dimi? Is it not identical with the
Boraitha concerning a man standing on the doorstep and passing things to
a mendicant in the street or to the master of a house (see Tract
Sabbath, p. 8)? Rabh does not dispute the Boraitha in that instance,
because it concerns a biblical law, but in this case where rabbinical
law is dealt with, the Rabbis assume the privilege of reënforcing
ordinances so as to preclude the possibility of transgression.

Rabba bar R. Huna in the name of R. Na'hman said: If between two courts
there was a wall, which was ten spans high from the ground of one court,
but on a level with the ground of

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

the other, <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md) the wall is ceded to the
latter court and considered part of its ground, but to the former court
it is an ordinary wall ten spans high. Why so? Because the use of the
wall is more convenient for the latter than for the former, and where an
object is more convenient for one than for another it is generally ceded
to the former.

Said R. Shezbi: "R. Na'hman rendered the same decision concerning a
ditch that was situated between two courts and was on a level with the
ground on one side."

If a man comes to diminish the size of the wall referred to in the
Mishna (either by heaping up earth at the bottom or by erecting posts or
benches at its side; such was the original definition of the manner by
which the size of the wall was diminished) and this was done to the
extent of four spans, or more, he may make use of the entire wall, but
if less than four spans he can use only as much of the wall as has been
diminished. What do you mean to say? In either case there is an
objection. If by diminishing the wall to the extent of less than four
spans the wall is actually diminished, why should it not be allowed to
use the entire wall, and if this does not constitute a diminution at
all, why should it be allowed to use that part (where the earth was
heaped up or the posts erected to the extent of less than four spans)?

Said Rabhina: In this case the Mishna does not mean to say, that the
wall was diminished by heaping up earth or erecting posts but simply
that a part of the wall was removed at the top. If the breach made in
this manner exceeded four spans it is considered as a door, and the
entire wall may be used, and if it was not quite four spans the entire
wall must not be used, but that part of the wall containing the breach
may, because its height is lessened.

R. Yechiel said: "If a basin was set down (bottom side up) at the bottom
of the wall, the wall is diminished thereby. How can a basin serve to
diminish the wall? A basin may be handled on the Sabbath, and is it not
a fact that any vessel which may be handled on Sabbath cannot serve to
diminish a wall because it can be removed? R. Yechiel means to say, if
the basin was fastened to the ground. And if it is fastened to the

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

ground may it not be removed nevertheless? By the statement "it was
fastened to the ground," is meant if it was fastened so that a hoe or a
pick-axe was required to remove it.

An Egyptian ladder does not diminish a wall but a ladder of Tyre does.
What is meant by an Egyptian ladder? One that has not four rungs. So
said the school of R. Janai.

Said R. A'ha the son of Rabha to R. Ashi: "Dost thou know why an
Egyptian ladder does not diminish a wall?" and R. Ashi answered: "Didst
thou not hear the statement of R. A'ha bar Ada in the name of R.
Hamnuna, quoting Rabh, to the effect that it was an article which may be
handled on the Sabbath and any article which may be handled on the
Sabbath cannot serve to diminish a wall?" If such be the case, why can a
ladder of Tyre serve to diminish a wall, may it not also be handled on
Sabbath? A ladder of Tyre can serve because it is so heavy that it would
require the efforts of several men to remove it.

Abayi said: If a wall ten spans high was between two courts and a ladder
four spans wide was placed at each side of the wall: if the ladders were
placed so that they are three spans apart, *i.e.*, the ladder placed on
the other side was three spans further up or down alongside of the wall
than the other ladder, the wall is not diminished; but if they are not
three spans apart the wall is diminished. If the wall, however, was four
spans deep so that a man can walk on it, it makes no difference how far
apart the ladders are.

R. Bibhi bar Abayi said: "If one erected two benches one above the other
at the foot of a wall, and the lower one was four spans wide while the
upper was less, the wall is thereby diminished. If the lower bench
however was less than four spans wide and the upper four, or more, the
wall is also diminished thereby, providing the two benches were less
than three spans apart." R. Na'hman said in the name of Rabba bar Abahu,
that the same rule applies to a ladder where there is empty space
between the rungs (*i.e.*, where one side of the ladder is not closed
with boards).

R. Na'hman said again in the name of Rabba bar Abahu: If a cornice four
spans square protrude from a wall and a ladder, no matter how narrow,
has been placed against the cornice, the size of the wall is thereby
diminished, provided the ladder was placed directly against the cornice,
but if placed underneath the cornice against the wall, the cornice was
merely

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

enlarged but the wall was not diminished. R. Na'hman says again in the
name of the same authority: a wall which is nineteen spans high must
have an additional cornice (a ladder which should be placed in the
centre of the wall so that the space should not attain ten spans at the
top or at the bottom). If the walls, however, measure twenty spans two
cornices are needed to make them valid. (One cornice a trifle less than
ten spans from the ground and another above that also a trifle less than
ten spans from the lower.)

Said R. Hisda: "Providing the cornices are not exactly opposite each
other (to prevent a ladder being placed on the bottom cornice)." R. Huna
said: "If a peg be placed on a pillar in public ground ten spans high
and four spans wide (which is legally private ground) the pillar is
diminished." Said R. Adha bar Ahaba: "Providing the peg is three spans
high." Abayi and Rabba both said: "Even if it is not as high as three
spans." Why so? Because the peg makes the pillar useless. R. Ashi,
however, said: "Even if the peg be three spans high it does not diminish
the pillar and does not make it private ground because a peg of that
kind can be used as a hanger."

R. A'ha the son of Rabha asked R. Ashi, "What is the law if several pegs
be placed on the pillar in question?" and he answered: "Did you not hear
what R. Johanan said concerning a well, that its enclosures of earth are
counted in with the ten spans (makes it a legal private ground), why
then should they be counted, are they not useless?" We must assume that,
because one can place an object upon the enclosures and thus use them.
The same is the case with the peg, one might also place something upon
it also.

R. Jehudah said in the name of Samuel: "If a wall be ten spans high it
requires, in order to become a valid wall, a ladder fourteen spans in
height, because the ladder must be placed against the wall at an angle
and the distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall being four
spans, the ladder loses that much before it reaches the top of the
wall." R. Joseph said: "Even if the ladder be a trifle over thirteen
spans high it may be used (because should it lack one span of reaching
the top of the wall the deficiency is not taken into consideration)."
Abayi, however, said: It matters not if the ladder be even a trifle over
eleven spans high (because should it lack three spans of reaching the
top of the wall, it is considered as being at the top, for the law of
"lavud" is applied in all cases where there is a

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

deficiency of three spans or less). R. Huna the son of R. Jehoshua,
however, said: The ladder may be only a trifle over seven spans in
height (because it is not compulsory to place the ladder at an angle,
and if placed straight at the wall, together with the three spans
allowed by the law of "lavud," it reaches the top. Should the ladder
even be placed at an angle it may be considered as straight at the wall
and the same rule applies).

Rabh said: "I have a tradition, that a ladder standing straight against
a wall also diminishes its size, but I know no reason for it." Said
Samuel to him: "Does Abba not know the reason for this? Why should a
ladder be worse than two benches placed one above the other? Surely it
is more difficult to scale a wall by means of benches than by means of a
ladder."

Rabha in the name of R. Hyya said: "Trunks of Babylonian fig-trees when
placed against a wall need not be fastened, because their weight is so
great, that it is very difficult to remove them, although they may be
handled on Sabbath." R. Joseph in the name of R. Oshiya said: "The same
applies to Babylonian ladders, which are so heavy, that there is no fear
of their being removed."

R. Joseph asked Rabba: "If a man had a ladder which he desired to place
against a wall and the ladder being too narrow, *i.e.*, less than four
spans wide, be hewed out in the wall itself, steps on each side of the
ladder, how far up should those steps be hewn out?" Rabba answered: "For
a distance of ten spans." Asked R. Joseph again: "How is it if a man
hews out steps four spans wide in the wall itself? How far up must he do
this?" and the answer was: "The entire height of the wall." "What is the
difference between the case of the ladder where steps had to be hewn out
additionally and this case where the steps were all hewn out of the
wall?" "In the first instance the ascent of the wall is so much easier
because the ladder can be placed against the wall at an angle, while in
this instance the ascent is much more difficult; hence the steps should
reach the entire height of the wall."

R. Joseph asked Rabba again What is the law if a man used a tree, which
grew right at the wall, for a ladder? I ask thee, taking into
consideration the difference of opinion between Rabbi and the sages.
According to Rabbi, who holds, that rabbinical ordinances were not
surrounded with precautionary measures for the sake of twilight, it may
be said, that in this

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

case, where the tree will be used during the whole Sabbath day, even
Rabbi might decide that it would not be allowed to make use of the tree;
and on the other hand, even according to the sages, who disagree with
Rabbi as regards the precautionary measures for the sake of twilight, it
may be said, that the tree might be considered as a door; which,
however, cannot be used because it is regarded as if a lion lie across
it; nevertheless, it is a door, and being such, the wall may be used.
Now, shouldst thou decide, that the wall may be used if a tree grow at
its side, how would it be if a grove such as is used in idolatrous
Worship, grow alongside of the wall? I ask thee in this instance taking
into consideration the difference of opinion between R. Jehudah and the
sages. We are aware that R. Jehudah permits the depositing of an Erub
even in a grave, notwithstanding the fact that no benefit must be
derived from a grave, but for the reason that after the Erub has been
deposited for the moment of twilight the grave is of no further use as
the Erub need not be watched. In this case, however, R. Jehudah might
prohibit the use of a grove, because it serves a distinct purpose,
namely, that of a walk to the wall, and it is a law that no benefit must
be derived from a grove used for idolatrous worship. On the other hand,
even according to the sages, who prohibit the use of a grave for the
depositing of an Erub, it might be permitted to use the grove because it
is virtually a door to the wall and is merely regarded as if a lion were
lying across it, which temporarily makes it unfit for use."

Rabba answered: "A tree may be used but a grove must not." R. Hisda
opposed this: "On the contrary," said he, "the lion lying across the
tree which renders it unfit for use temporarily is the rabbinical
ordinance concerning the Sabbath-rest, *i.e.*, the tree must not be used
on account of the Sabbath, while the grove must not be used for another
reason altogether hence it should be permitted to use the grove and the
use of the tree should be prohibited."

It was also taught, that when Rabhin came from Palestine, he said in the
name of R. Elazar, according to another version R. Abahu said in the
name of R. Johanan: (This is the rule:) Whenever the prohibition is
based upon the Sabbath-rest laws, such prohibition must stand, but
whenever the prohibition is based in some other law, it need not hold
good. A R. Na'hman bar Itz'hak taught: "Concerning a tree the same
divergence of opinion as exists between Rabbi and the

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

sages remains, and concerning a grove the same difference of opinion as
exists between R. Jehudah and the sages remains."

MISHNA: If two courts be separated by a ditch, ten spans deep and four
wide, the inmates of each court should prepare separate Erubin and must
not join in one, even though the ditch be filled with stubble or with
straw. Should it however be filled with earth or pebbles, the inmates
must join in one Erub and not prepare two separate ones. If a board four
spans wide had been put across the ditch, and likewise, if two
projecting balconies, one opposite the other, have been connected by
means of such a board, or plank, the inmates of the courts may prepare
separate Erubin, or if they prefer it, they may join in one; if the
board, however, was less (than four spans) wide, they must each prepare
a separate Erub, and not join in one.

GEMARA: The Mishna states, that if the ditch was filled with stubble or
straw, the inmates of each court must make a separate Erub, because the
straw is not considered firm enough to afford a safe passage over the
ditch, *i.e.*, it does not constitute a solid filling for the ditch, but
in the succeeding Mishna we learn, that if there be between two courts a
straw-rick, the inmates of each court must prepare a separate Erub,
thereby demonstrating that straw can form a solid partition? Answered
Abayi: As for a partition all agree that a straw-rick can form a
partition, but as for straw serving as a filling for a ditch it depends
upon whether the owner has devoted it entirely for that purpose. If he
did and will not remove it, it may constitute a solid filling for the
ditch, but if he did not and intends to subsequently remove it, it
cannot be considered such.

"*Should it however be filled with earth or pebbles*." Even if the man
who did this, does not declare that he has devoted the earth or the
pebbles for that purpose entirely? Have we not learned in a Mishna, that
if a man filled a room (which had contained a corpse) with straw or
pebbles and declared that he does not intend to make any further use of
either the straw or the pebbles, the room is regarded as filled up and
is not considered a tent, but if no such declaration was made, the room
is still considered a tent. Thus we see, that one must declare the straw
and pebbles to be devoted for such purpose only, and our Mishna does not
state anything in regard to this? Said R. Assi: This Mishna treating of
Erubin is in accordance with the opinion of R. Jose in a Tosephta (in
Tract Oholoth) who holds, that in the case of straw no express
declaration is necessary.

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

R. Huna, the son of R. Jehoshua, however, said: Thou wouldst prove a
contradiction from a law pertaining to uncleanness to a Sabbath-law?
Leave out the prohibition of Sabbath; for a thing which must not be
handled on Sabbath is at all events sacrificed even if it be a purse of
money; because it must not be handled on Sabbath. (With straw it is
different, because that is food for animals, and hence may be handled on
Sabbath.)

R. Ashi, however, said: Thou wouldst base a contradiction on an
ordinance concerning a room to that concerning a ditch. A ditch was made
to be filled up, but is then a room also made to be filled up?

"*If a board four spans wide had been put across the ditch*." Said
Rabha: "When must the board be four spans wide? If it was laid crosswise
across the ditch, but if it was laid lengthwise across the ditch it
makes no difference how wide the board is, because the width of the
ditch was decreased to less than four spans.

"*If two projecting balconies, one opposite the other*," etc. Said
Rabha: The statement in the Mishna, "one opposite the other," might be
construed to signify, that if they were not directly opposite each
other, no connection could be made; such is the case, however, only if
they are three spans or more distant one from the other. Should they be
less apart than three spans, it matters not whether they are directly
opposite, diagonally so, or even one above the other, a connection may
be made and it is simply considered a crooked balcony, but a balcony
nevertheless.

MISHNA: If there be between two courts a straw-rick, ten spans high, the
inmates of both courts must prepare separate Erubin, and must not join
in one. Cattle maybe fed from each side of the rick (and no fear need be
entertained, that it will become less than ten spans high). Should the
rick become less than ten spans high, the inmates must join in one Erub
and not prepare two.

GEMARA: Said R. Huna: "(Cattle may be fed from each side of the rick),
providing the straw is not removed by a man and placed in the crib of
the cattle (because the straw was designated as a partition since the
preceding day, hence it must not be handled)." Did we not learn in a
Boraitha: "If a house which was filled with straw stand between two
courts, the inmates of each court must make a separate Erub, but must
not join in one, and may remove the straw from the house to their

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

respective courts and place it in the crib for the cattle?" Thus we see,
that it is allowed for the inmates of each court to remove the straw to
their respective courts and place it in the crib; why does R. Huna
prohibit this? I will tell thee: In a house, on account of the roof, it
will become noticeable if the heap of straw becomes lower than ten
spans, but a straw-rick standing in the open air might be overlooked as
to its height.

(The above Boraitha continues as follows:) "If the heap of straw
contained in the house became less than ten spans high, neither of the
inmates of either court are permitted to carry unless the inmates of one
court resign their right to the place in favor of the inmates of the
other." Thus, if the heap of straw *was* ten spans high, it still serves
the purpose of a partition, even though it does not reach the ceiling.
We may adduce therefrom, that any partition if it be only ten spans
high, though it should not reach the ceiling, is valid. From the
statement in the Boraitha, that neither of the inmates of either court
are permitted to carry we can also infer, that any dwellings which may
have been added on the Sabbath are included in the prohibition? This is
not conclusive evidence! It may be that the Boraitha refers to a case
where the heap of straw was diminished to less than ten spans' height
before the Sabbath set in.

The Boraitha continues further: "The one wishing to make use of his
court should lock up the house and resign his right to the ground."
What, do both? Lock the house and resign his right to the ground? Yea;
both are necessary, for the man is accustomed to use the house on
Sabbath, <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md) and he might perchance, if
he leave it unlocked, come and use it.

Continuing, the Boraitha states: "If he did so, he must not carry, but
his neighbor may." Is this not self-evident? We might assume that the
man's neighbor must also do as he did, hence we are told, that the Tana
holds repeated resignation of the ground to be prohibited.

MISHNA: How are alleys (entries) to be combined? A man places a cask of
wine (in the alley) and says: "This shall be for all the inmates of the
alley," and he may transfer the right of possession (which he has in the
cask) to them either through his adult son or daughter, or through his
Hebrew man-servant

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

or maid-servant, or through his wife; but he cannot transfer his right
of possession through his minor son or daughter, or through his
Canaanitish bond-man or bond-woman, because their hand is virtually the
same as his.

GEMARA: Said R. Jehudah: The person that accepts the transfer of
ownership should lift the cask of wine at least one span from the ground
at the time of acceptance (saying, I have accepted this for the other
inmates). Said Rabha: These two things were said by the old sages of
Pumbaditha, namely: This statement of R. Jehudah just quoted and the
other one is: When a man pronounces the benediction over a goblet of
wine, if he tastes a whole mouthful he has acquitted himself of the duty
properly, otherwise he does not.

An objection was raised: We have learned in a Boraitha: How are alleys
to be combined? A cask of wine, oil, dates, or figs, or any other fruit,
is brought, and if belonging to the one who brought it, he should
transfer his right of possession to the other inmates; but if the others
have a share in it to commence with, he need only inform them (that he
has combined the Erub for them). While transferring the right of
possession, the cask should be lifted off the ground a trifle? By a
trifle the Boraitha also means a span.

It was taught: At the combining of alleys, the right of possession need
not be transferred. So said Rabh; but Samuel maintains, that this must
be done. At the combining of the legal limits, however, Samuel declares
that the right of possession must be transferred, while Rabh holds, that
it is not necessary.

Samuel may be right in his opinion, because he holds in accordance with
our Mishna, which teaches, that at the combining of alleys, the right of
ownership must be transferred, and at the combining of legal limits
nothing is said about transfer, but upon what does Rabh base his
opinion? There is a difference of opinion among Tanaim concerning this
ordinance as R. Jehudah said in the name of Rabh: "It happened that the
daughter-in-law of R. Oshiya went to the bath-house, and not returning
before dusk, her mother-in-law made an Erub for her. When this was told
to R. Hyya, he declared it unlawful. Said R. Ishmael bar R. Jose to him:
Thou Babylonian! So strict art thou with Erubin. Then said my father:
Whatever can be made more lenient with regard to Erubin, should so be
made."

Said R. Zera to R. Jacob, the son of the daughter of Jacob:

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When thou goest to
Palestine, go out of thy way and pass through Tyre and ask of R. Jacob
bar Idi how the case was: Did the mother-in-law make an Erub with her
own material, and on account of not transferring her ownership to her
daughter-in-law, R. Hyya held it to be unlawful, or did she make it with
material belonging to her daughter-in-law and R. Hyya held it to be
unlawful because the daughter-in-law was not informed?" R. Jacob bar Idi
answered, that it was on account of the ownership not having been
transferred.

R. Na'hman said: "We are in possession of a tradition which teaches us,
that whether Erubin of legal limits or Erubin of courts or combinations
of entries are concerned, a transfer of ownership must be effected. Now
the question arises as to Erubin of cooked articles, <span
id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) whether a transfer of ownership is
necessary or not." Said R. Jose: "What question is this? Did R. Na'hman
not hear the dictum of R. Na'hman bar R. Ada in the name of Samuel, that
in the case of Erubin of cooked articles a transfer of ownership must
also be effected?" Replied Abayi: "Assuredly he did not hear this dictum
or he would not have asked." Rejoined R. Jose: "Did not Samuel say that
in the case of Erubin of courts a transfer of ownership is not necessary
and still R. Na'hman maintains that it is?" Abayi then said: "How can
this be compared? In the case of Erubin of courts and legal limits there
is a difference of opinion between Rabh and Samuel, while R. Na'hman
accepts the more rigorous decrees of each, but in this instance how
could R. Na'hman override the absolute decree of Samuel alone?"

There was a guard of the arsenal living in the neighborhood of R. Zera.
His neighbors asked him to rent them his place for the Sabbath, but he
refused. So R. Zera was asked whether the place may be rented from the
man's wife, who was willing to do so. He answered them: "Thus said Resh
Lakish in the name of a great man, *i.e.*, R. Hanina: A man's wife may
effect an Erub without the man's knowledge (or against his will)."

The same case occurred in the neighborhood of R. Jehudah

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

bar Oshiya, and when asked concerning the law in the matter, he did not
know. R. Mathna could not solve the problem either. When R. Jehudah,
however, asked, he answered in the name of Samuel the dictum attributed
above to R. Hanina.

An objection was raised: We have learned in a Boraitha: "If women made
an Erub or combined in an alley without the knowledge of their husbands,
the Erub and the combination are both unlawful." This presents no
difficulty. The Boraitha refers to a case, where the husbands distinctly
forbid their wives to do so, whereas Samuel refers to a case, where the
husbands did not forbid them. Such seems to be the case, for were it not
so Samuel would contradict himself as he said elsewhere: If one of the
inmates of the alley who, as a rule, combined with the others, refused
to do so at one time, the other inmates may enter his house and take his
share against his will. Thus we see, that only if the man, *as a rule*,
combined but (out of spite) refused in one instance, then and then
*only* the other inmates may take his share by force; but if he was not
in the habit of combining, this would not be allowed. Hence this bears
it out.

Can we assume that the following Boraitha is in support of the decree of
Samuel? (It teaches:) "It is permitted to compel a man to take a share
in the erection of a side and cross beam to an entry, if he refuses to
do so voluntarily." In the case of an entry it is different, because
there were no partitions (hence it was difficult to watch the entry).
According to another interpretation, Where an act is committed out of
spite, with the intention to injure another, it is different (*i.e.*, a
man may be compelled to desist as explained in Chapter IV., page
[109](eru08.htm#page_109)). <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

it was taught: R. Hyya bar Ashi said: "A side-beam may be made of a
grove." R. Simeon ben Lakish said: "A crossbeam may be made of a grove."
One who says, that a crossbeam may be made of a grove certainly permits
a side-beam also to be made of a grove; but he who says, that a
side-beam may be made thus, does not permit a cross-beam. Why so?
Because a cross-beam must be sound enough to hold a brick one span
thick, and as a grove (being used for idolatry) must be burned, it is
considered as if it were already burned, hence not sound enough to hold
a brick of the prescribed thickness.

MISHNA: If the quantity of food (required for the combination) become
diminished, one may (himself) add thereto and transfer his right of
possession without notifying the other inmates (to that effect). If,
however, new inhabitants have (since) arrived in the alley, he adds
sufficient to make up the required legal quantity, transfers his right
of possession to them and notifies them to that effect. How much is this
legal quantity (of food required for the combination of alleys)? If
those who join therein are numerous, it must be sufficient for two meals
for all of them; but if they be few, the size of a dried fig for each is
sufficient.

R. Jose said: "To what does this regulation apply? To the original
(first) preparation of the Erub; but to extend the Erub (for later use)
any quantity, however small, is sufficient. Nor did the sages direct
that (where the combinations of an alley had been effected) an Erub
should be prepared for the several courts (contained in the alley)
except that the children might not forget about the law of Erub.

GEMARA: What food does the Mishna refer to as having become diminished?
Shall we assume, that it was but one kind of food, then even had it been
totally destroyed, it was not necessary to notify the other inmates; if
on the other hand there were two kinds of food, then, even, if it became
diminished, the man was in duty bound to notify the other inmates, as we
have learned in a Boraitha: "If the food was all of one kind and was
totally destroyed, one need not notify the other inmates; but if the
food was of two different kinds, one must notify the other inmates." (It
was assumed that the same law applied to food

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

that had merely become diminished, but the Gemara answered:) "The
Boraitha refers to food that had been totally destroyed, but with food
that had become diminished, it is different."

"*How much is this legal quantity?*" etc. What does the Mishna mean to
say by "numerous"? Said R. Jehudah in the name of Samuel: "Eighteen
persons." Eighteen and not more? Say, from eighteen on and upwards. Then
why state eighteen in the first place? Said R. Itz'hak the son of R.
Jehudah: My father explained this to me thus: If the food were divided
equally amongst all and the share of each for two meals would not amount
to the size of a dried fig, then those who took part were "numerous,"
and it is sufficient if the share of each did not amount to the size of
a dried fig; but if the share of each amounted to more than the size of
a dried fig, those who took part are considered few, and even if each
received but the size of one dried fig, it is sufficient. (Thus both are
the more lenient constructions of the law.) Incidentally we are told by
R. Jehudah that eighteen dried figs are sufficient for two meals.

MISHNA: The Erub (of courts) or combination (of alleys) maybe effected
with all kinds of nutriment except water and salt. Such is the dictum of
R. Eliezer. R. Jehoshua, however, said: Only a whole loaf of bread is a
lawful Erub. Should even a whole saah of flour be baked into one loaf,
and that be broken, it must not be used for an Erub, while a small loaf
of the value of an Eesar (a small coin; probably the Roman "as") if it
be whole, may be used for an Erub.

GEMARA: Have we not already learned the first clause of this Mishna (in
Chapter III., Mishna i), that the Erub or combination may be effected
with all kinds of nutriment except water and salt? Said Rabba bar bar
Hana: This Mishna repeats the ordinance solely on account of R.
Jehoshua, who maintains, that only a whole loaf is a
[lawful](errata.htm#8.md) Erub, but not a broken loaf. Hence we are taught
that with *all kinds* of nutriment it may be effected, including a
broken loaf.

What reason has R. Jehoshua for his assertion? Said R. Jose ben Saul in
the name of Rabbi: "In order to prevent enmity (lest one say he
deposited a whole loaf and another a broken loaf, etc.)." Said R. A'ha
the son of Rabba to R. Ashi: "How is it if all deposited broken loaves?"
and R. Ashi answered: "There is fear that the next time the Erubin are
deposited there will be the same strife. One will deposit a whole loaf
and another a broken one, etc."

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

R. Johanan ben Saul said: "If from a whole loaf of bread the legal first
dough (offering) has been removed or from a whole loaf of bread made of
Therumah and ordinary flour the legal one-hundredth part had been
removed, the loaf is still considered whole, and an Erub may be effected
therewith." Did we not learn in a Boraitha, that the loaf remains whole,
and may be used for an Erub if the legal one-hundredth part had been
removed, but if the quantity of the legal first dough had been removed
it does not remain whole and must not be used for an Erub? This presents
no difficulty. R. Johanan refers to the loaf of a baker who must remove
only a small piece for the first dough, while the Boraitha refers to a
loaf of a householder as we have learned in a Mishna (Tract Chalah):
"The prescribed quantity for the first dough is one twenty-fourth. One
who prepares the dough for his own use or for the wedding (feast) of his
son must also give one twenty-fourth; but a baker, or even a woman who
prepares the dough for sale in the market, need only give one
forty-eighth as the legal first dough."

R. Hisda said: "If a man made a loaf whole again by joining the broken
pieces with a stick of wood, so that it appeared like an unbroken loaf,
he may use it for an Erub."

Said R. Zera in the name of Samuel: "It is permitted to make an Erub
with bread made of rice or millet." Said Mar Uqba: "Samuel the Master
explained to me that rice-bread may be used for an Erub but not
millet-bread." R. Hyya bar Abbin in the name of Rabh said: It is also
permitted to make an Erub with lentil-bread.

MISHNA: A man may give money to the wine-seller or baker in order to
acquire the right to join in the Erub. Such is the dictum of R. Eliezer;
but the sages hold, that money cannot acquire the right for a person to
join in the Erub. They admit, however, that if a man give money to
another person (with the commission to effect the Erub for him) it will
acquire for him the right to join in the Erub, since no Erub can be
effected for a man without his knowledge. Said R. Jehudah: To what do
these (preceding) regulations apply? To the Erubin of limits; in the
Erubin of courts, however, a man may be included with or without his
knowledge; for advantages may be conferred on a person, even though he
be not present, whereas, he must not be deprived of his right in his
absence.

GEMARA: What reason has R. Eliezer for his dictum? The person giving the
money to the wine-seller or the baker

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

did not draw his purchase toward him, hence no sale or purchase was
effected. <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md)

Answered R. Na'hman in the name of Rabba bar Abahu: "R. Eliezer makes
this case analogous with the case mentioned in the Mishna (Tract Cholin,
Chapter V., Mishna 4) concerning a man who purchases one dinar's worth
meat and the butcher is compelled to slaughter for him an ox worth one
thousand dinars. The question there is propounded by the Gemara: 'How
can the sale be effective? No drawing towards himself was accomplished
by the purchaser?' and the answer was that the Meshi'kha (drawing) was
dispensed with for the sake of the advantage which was to be conferred
on the purchaser on the four days or periods enumerated. In this case of
our Mishna the Meshi'kha is also dispensed with and for the same reason,
or according to the reason of another sage in the mentioned Tract
(Cholin) who said that according to biblical law a sale is effective
when the money for the purchase is paid."

"*They admit, however, that if a man give money to another*," etc. What
is meant by "another person"? Said Rabh: "A householder," and Samuel
agrees with him, meaning, that this other person must be a householder
and not a baker (or a wine-seller). Samuel added, that only if the man
gave *money* to the baker he cannot acquire the right to join in the
Erub, but if he gave him a vessel he does acquire the right. Also if
when giving him the money, he does not say to him: "With this money thou
shalt give me bread sufficient to make an Erub," but says: "For this
money thou shalt go and effect an Erub for me," then it is as if he
merely commissioned him to effect his Erub and he acquires the right to
join in the Erub.

"*Said R. Jehudah: To what do these ordinances apply?*" etc. R. Jehudah
in the name of Samuel said: "The Halakha prevails according to R.
Jehudah, not only in this case, but in all instances where R. Jehudah
decrees concerning Erubin, the Halakha prevails in accordance with his
dictum." Said R. Hana of Bagdad to him: "Does Samuel hold, that even in
the case where R. Jehudah declares an entry, from which the side and
cross beams had been removed, valid, the Halakha prevails

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

accordingly?" Answered R. Jehudah: "Did I not state particularly
concerning Erubin, but not concerning partitions?"

Said R. A'ha the son of Rabha to R. Ashi: "If it is said, that the
Halakha prevails according to R. Jehudah, then there must be some who
disagree with him?" Did not R. Jehoshua ben Levi say, that whenever we
find in a Mishna the statement: "Said R. Jehudah. 'When is this the
case?' or 'When do these regulations apply?'" it is not to be accepted
as a refutation of previous decrees, but merely as a further explanation
of the [decree](errata.htm#9.md) of the sages? \[How can it be said, that
it is not to be accepted as a refutation? Did we not learn in a previous
Mishna, that if additional inhabitants came into the alley, the right of
possession must be transferred to them and they must be notified,
whereas R. Jehudah states, that no notification is necessary? The
previous Mishna refers to a court between two alleys when the
inhabitants newly arrived must be notified that the Erub was effected in
one of the alleys (and R. Jehudah would agree to this also). Did not R.
Shezbi say in the name of R. Hisda, that the previous Mishna distinctly
states, that the colleagues of R. Jehudah differ with his dictum in this
last Mishna?\] Answered R. Ashi (the previous question of R. A'ha):
Wouldst thou make a contradiction from one man to another? Samuel may
hold one thing and R. Jehoshua ben Levi another.

Referring again to the statement of R. Jehoshua ben Levi, R. Johanan
said, that whenever R. Jehudah says: "When is this the case?" he means
to explain the previous teachings, but whenever he says, "When do these
regulations apply?" he means to differ from the foregoing opinions.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_47"></span>[182:1](eru11.htm#fr_47.md) Rashi explains the term
"on a level with the ground" to signify, that it was less than ten spans
higher than the ground, in which case it is considered as level with the
ground.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[189:1](eru11.htm#fr_48.md) Rashi asserts, that the
Tana of this Boraitha maintains, that all those who resign their right
to the ground of their houses should also lock them, but Tosphath does
not agree with Rashi.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[191:1](eru11.htm#fr_49.md) Erubin of cooked
articles, called in Hebrew "Erubin Thabhshilin." When a Sabbath follows
a festival, no food must be cooked on the festival for the Sabbath, but
in order to circumvene this ordinance the Rabbis decreed that two
different kinds of food be set aside on the eve of the festival to serve
for the Sabbath and thus enable the people to cook, in addition to the
food set aside, on the festival in order to provide for the Sabbath.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[192:1](eru11.htm#fr_50.md) What we have rendered
above with "Where an act is committed out of spite, etc., it is
different," is expressed in the Hebrew original with but two words,
viz.: "Metzad Sheäni," literally, "from the side it is different." The
marginal notes in the original also state that no explanation for the
two words can be found, and in the monographs printed in Venice and
Saloniki some two centuries ago, this other version is omitted entirely.
In a manuscript of the Talmud, examined by R. N. Rabinowicz, it is also
not to be found. According to our method, always to render the other
version, because it is invariably more reasonable than the first, we
should have omitted the first here also, and more especially so, as it
is very abstruse. How ever, the other version is even more so if read as
written. After considerable speculation, however, as to its meaning, we
found that it is merely a and instead of "Metza*d* Sheäni" should read
"Métzar Sheäni." The misprint is the more excusable because of the
extreme similarity of a Hebrew Daled ‏ד‎ and a Resh ‏ר‎ Métzar Sheäni
means "With one who wishes to injure another, it is different" and this
was just the case referred to by Samuel, who, according to Rashi, refers
to one <span id="page_193">p. 193</span> who, out of spite, would not
combine, so that the other inmates of the alley would be prevented from
carrying on the Sabbath; hence, in this instance no further explanation
by Rashi was necessary.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[196:1](eru11.htm#fr_51.md) A sale or a purchase
was not binding or effective unless the purchaser at the time of the
purchase drew the object bought towards him, and this act of drawing
towards him is called in the Talmud Meshi'kha, based upon the passage,
Exod. xii. 21.
