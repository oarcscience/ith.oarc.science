# INTRODUCTION TO TRACT ERUBIN.

THIS Tract, virtually the third of the Sabbath series, treats of
subjects similar to those discussed in the first two. The main point of.
difference is, that most of the laws laid down in the preceding two
volumes are founded on biblical behests, while those instituted in the
present volume are of purely rabbinical origin, notwithstanding the
assertion of a solitary individual who appears in the course of a debate
and declares that the legal-limit branch of the Erub is a biblical
enactment.

A remarkable feature of the Tract is the exposition of the manner in
which the shrewd sages circumvene the rigorous prohibitions contained in
the Tract Sabbath and how they take advantage of every loophole afforded
them through imperfections in the law, at the same time avoiding any
palpable infraction of the law itself.

As already explained in the introduction to Volume I., the restrictions
with which the Sabbath was surrounded had their unquestionable political
import, but their very rigor made the sages, than whom none knew the
people better, doubt whether enforcement and still less voluntary
observance could ever be possible. It became necessary, therefore, to
find some way of modifying the law, not directly, but by the institution
of other in a measure counteracting laws. The solution for this problem
presented itself in the "Erub" (literally "commixture") ordinances, the
first results of which were to bring about a distinction between the
different kinds of ground inhabited by man. Lines of demarcation between
public, unclaimed, and private ground and ground which was under no
particular jurisdiction were strictly drawn. Whatever ground, however,
could be made by hook or crook to come under the category of private
ground was eagerly included, as in the latter things could be carried
about at will. In order, therefore, to have as much private ground as
possible, each man having an interest in public ground would relinquish
or transfer his right to his neighbor and thus make it communal or
private property. Of course, this could be

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

done only among Israelites, and where a Gentile had an interest in a
piece of coveted ground, his share had to be bought outright.

It was this desire to be in the same neighborhood, yea, even on the same
grounds, that laid the foundation of the subsequent Ghettos, still
flourishing in most of the large cities of the world. How this communal
living was fostered may be readily understood, when it is stated that
the sages permitted the execution of a written instrument in Palestine
an the Sabbath, under ordinary circumstances a grave offence, where a
piece of property had to be purchased from a Gentile for communal
purposes. (See Gitin, 8b, and Schulchan Aruch Orach Chaym, 306, §11.)

The name of this Tract may be said to have a certain significance. The
Hebrew word "Erub" has a variety of meanings, among them "commixture,"
as stated, "agreeable," "secure," and "safeguard." As the discussions in
the Tract will demonstrate, either one of these meanings may be applied
to the appellation of the Tract and still express the purpose of the
laws ordained. By those laws the observance of the Sabbath was made
"secure," they proved a "safeguard" against "amalgamation" or "mingling"
with other nations, and by virtue of the modification to the laws of
Sabbath which was brought about, the observance of the Sabbath was made
more "agreeable." Several other meanings might be utilized in the same
manner, but lest they seem far-fetched they are omitted.

Another peculiarity of this Tract is that under no circumstances and on
no occasion is the derivation of a law enacted in this particular Tract
inquired into, and unlike other tracts there will not be found a single
query as to where the Mishna derives the law. For want of other sources
the institution of the Erub has been attributed to King Solomon, *vide*
page 51.

The main subjects of discussion in the following pages will be how this
Erub shall be effected, what materials shall be used to bring about a
commixture, how entries (by which is meant the entry to a court or a
yard where an aggregation of families reside) are to be arranged, and
the like.

Altogether there are four kinds of Erubin, only three of which will be
discussed in this treatise. They are: The combining of courts, the
combining of limits, and the combining of streets, also known as
junction. The other commixture is called combining of cookery, which
will be treated at length in Tract Yom Tob.

<span id="page_vii">p. vii</span>

The combining of courts deals with the regulations by the observance of
which various houses standing in one court are joined together into one
common ground, thus enabling the householders to carry and convey
articles to and from one another. The combining of limits treats of the
regulations through which the distance of two thousand ells, beyond
which no Israelite is allowed to travel on the Sabbath, may be legally
extended.

The combining of streets treats of the rules to be observed in the case
of narrow streets and public places which can be turned into private
ground under certain conditions.

Finally, it may be well to add that, of all the difficult and
complicated treatises in the Talmud, the Tract Erubin is by far the most
difficult, and in a great many places almost incomprehensible to other
than the most careful students.
