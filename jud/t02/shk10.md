# CHAPTER VI.

MISHNA: (*a*) There were thirteen curved chests <span
id="fr_68"></span>[a1](#fn_68.md) and thirteen tables in the Sanctuary, and
thirteen prostrations took place in the Sanctuary. The family of R.
Gamaliel and of R. Hananiah, chief of the priests, made fourteen
prostrations; this extra prostration was made towards the
wood-chamber, <span id="fr_69"></span>[a2](#fn_69.md) because, according to
an ancestral tradition, the ark was hidden there.

(*b*) Once a priest <span id="fr_70"></span>[b1](#fn_70.md) was engaged
there, and he noticed that one of the paving-stones on one place
appeared different from the others. He went out to tell others of it;
but he had not yet finished speaking, when he gave up the ghost; thereby
it was known to a certainty that the ark of the covenant <span
id="fr_71"></span>[b2](#fn_71.md) was hidden there.

(*c*) In what direction were the prostrations made? Four towards the
north, four towards the south, three towards the east,

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

and two towards the occident; *i.e.*, towards the thirteen gates. <span
id="fr_72"></span>[c1](#fn_72.md) The southern gates were near a corner of
the western. These were: The upper gate, the fire gate, the firstling
gate, and the water gate. Why is it called water gate? Because a glass
of water was carried through it for the sprinkling of the altar on the
Feast of Booths. R. Eliezer son of Jacob says: At that gate the waters
(flowing from the Holy of Holies) commence to flow rapidly downwards,
until they again flow out under the threshold of the Temple. Opposite
there were the northern gates, near the other corner of the western.
These were: The door of Jekhaniah, the gate of sacrifice, the women's
gate, and the music-gate; and why is the first one called the gate of
Jekhaniah? Because Jekhaniah went through it, when he went into exile.
In the east was the gate Nikanur, which also had two small doors, <span
id="fr_73"></span>[c2](#fn_73.md) one to the right and the other to the
left; lastly, there were two in the west, which were nameless.

(*d*) Thirteen tables were in the Sanctuary: Eight marble ones in the
slaughter-house, on which the entrails were washed. Two to the west of
the altar-sheep, one marble and one silver: on the marble one the
sacrificial pieces were placed, and on the silver table the utensils
were placed. Two in the corridor on the inside of the Temple entrance, a
marble table and a golden one: on the marble one the showbreads were
placed at the time they were brought in, and on the golden one when they
were taken out; because the principle is, that the veneration of the

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

sacred must be heightened and not lessened. <span
id="fr_74"></span>[d1](#fn_74.md) Lastly, there was one golden table in the
Temple itself, upon which the showbreads were constantly lying.

\(e\) Thirteen curved chests were in the Sanctuary. <span
id="fr_75"></span>[e1](#fn_75.md) On them was written: *Old* shekalim,
*new* shekalim, bird-offerings, doves for whole-offerings, wood,
incense, gold for the cover of the Holy of Holies. Six were for
donations in general. <span id="fr_76"></span>[e2](#fn_76.md) The term
*new* shekalim is used for those paid annually. *Old* shekalim were
those which were paid by men who had failed to pay them in the year when
they were due, and paid them in the following year. "In those marked
'bird-offerings,' the money for turtle-doves was deposited; in those
marked 'doves,' money for young doves was deposited: but they were all
whole-offerings." So says R. Jehudah. The sages say: "In the former,
money for both sin-offerings and whole-offerings was placed, and in the
latter only for whole-offerings." <span id="fr_77"></span>[e3](#fn_77.md)

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

(*f*) If one vow, "I will furnish wood for the altar," he must not
furnish less than two cords. If one vow (to furnish) incense, he must
not furnish less than a handful. If one vow (to furnish) gold coin, he
must not furnish less than a Dinar. <span id="fr_78"></span>[f1](#fn_78.md)
Six (chests) were for voluntary offerings. What was done with these?
Whole-offerings were bought for these, the meat of which was sacrificed
to God, but the hides belonged to the priests. <span
id="fr_79"></span>[f2](#fn_79.md) The following explanation was made by
Jehoiada the high priest, of the expression \[Lev. v. 19\]: "It is a
trespass-offering; be hath, in trespassing, trespassed against the
Lord": The rule is: With everything coming in under the name of sin or
guilt offering, whole-offerings arc bought, the meat of which is offered
up to God and the hides of which belong to the priests; hence the two
expressions: A guilt-offering for God and a guilt-offering for the
priests, as it is written \[II Kings xii. 16\]: "The money for
trespass-offerings and the money for sin-offerings was not brought into
the house of the Lord: it belonged to the priests."

# CHAPTER VI.

MISHNA *a*. The thirteen chests were used as explained in Mishna *e*,
and they were shaped like horns, so that a hand could not be inserted
from the top. This Mishna places the number of everything at thirteen
(on account of the thirteen kinds of mercy attributed to God). R.
Ishmael composed the thirteen rules with which the Law is expounded.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[25:a2](shk10.htm#fr_69.md) The location of the
wood-chamber can be determined in Tract Midoth.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[25:b1](shk10.htm#fr_70.md) MISHNA *b*. The priest
was a man of blemish (deformed), and could not take part in the
sacrifices, but was allowed to select and peel the wood used at the
altar.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[25:b2](shk10.htm#fr_71.md) The ark was hidden
during the existence of the first Temple in order to save it from the
Babylonians, after all hope had been abandoned, and its hiding-place was
underground. The priests who subsequently took charge probably noticed
some sign made by the former generation when the ark was hidden, and
this particular priest died as a consequence of his attempt to reveal
the secret.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[26:c1](shk10.htm#fr_72.md) MISHNA *c*. That there
were thirteen gates in the Temple is vouched for by Abba Jose ben
Johanan; but the sages declare, that there were only seven gates and
that the thirteen prostrations were made in the direction of the twelve
breaches made by the Greeks in the walls of the Temple at the time of
the Maccabees, and towards the altar; the twelve breaches had been
repaired, and each prostration was a mark of gratitude for the good
fortune. From the fact, however, that the Mishna cites nine of the gates
by their names and describes their location, it seems that Abba Jose ben
Johanan was correct, and had his knowledge of the matter from tradition.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[26:c2](shk10.htm#fr_73.md) Concerning the gate
Nikanur, it is said that the two doors were made in the gate proper,
because the gates were very heavy and it required a number of priests
and Levites to open them (as explained in Tract Tamid). Hence, in order
to facilitate entrance and egress, the two doors were added.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[27:d1](shk10.htm#fr_74.md) MISHNA *d*. Because the
showbreads were lying on a golden table in the Temple, they were not to
be placed on marble tables when taken out.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[27:e1](shk10.htm#fr_75.md) MISHNA *e*. When a man
paid his half-shekel in Jerusalem, he would go to the Temple and throw
his half-shekel into the chest marked *new* shekalim. Into the chest
marked *old* shekalim, such as had not given pledges for the payment of
the Shekalim, and came voluntarily to pay same, would throw their
half-shekel. One who wished to donate money for specific purposes,
*e.g.,* for bird-offerings, etc., would deposit the money in the
respectively marked chests.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[27:e2](shk10.htm#fr_76.md) Only one of these
chests was for donations in general. The other five were marked as
follows: One, "For the remainder of a sin-offering," *i.e.*, money left
over from a sum originally intended for the purchase of a sin-offering,
was thrown into this chest and was used only for sin-offerings; the
second, "for the remainder of guilt-offerings"; the third, "for the
remainder of bird-offerings of women who had been confined and of
persons suffering fro m venereal diseases"; the fourth, "for the
remainder of Nazarite-offerings"; and the fifth, "for the remainder of
offerings of those afflicted with sores." If any one had money left over
from such offerings, he deposited it in the respectively marked cases.
The contents of the chest marked "for donations in general" were used
for the maintenance of the Temple. (Maimonides.)

<span id="fn_77"></span>[27:e3](shk10.htm#fr_77.md) R. Jehudah means to
say, that a man who throws money into the chest marked "for
bird-offerings" intends that his offerings <span id="page_28">p.
28</span> should be for the altar only, and not for the benefit of those
who eat sacrifices, while the sages differ with him, as stated in the
Mishna.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[28:f1](shk10.htm#fr_78.md) MISHNA *f*. In the
preceding Mishna the remainder of offerings is treated of, and it made
no difference how little the remainder was, it could be thrown into the
chest. In this Mishna, the case of a man who vows to bring an offering
is spoken of, and a minimum value is placed.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[28:f2](shk10.htm#fr_79.md) Incidentally we are
told that the meat of the sacrifices belonged to the Divinity, while the
hides belonged to the priests; and what immense sums were realized from
the sale of such hides may be gleaned from the mentioned "Priester und
Cultus," by Büchler.
