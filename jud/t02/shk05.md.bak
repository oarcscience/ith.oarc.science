# TRACT SHEKALIM.

UNDER this heading the payment of a head-tax is treated of, which
amounted to one-half of a shekel (in the Mishna always referred to as a
*shekel*) and which had to be paid by every Israelite (see Exodus xxx.
12) upon the completion of his twentieth year. In the times of the
existence of the Temple, the proceeds of this tax were applied for
communal sacrifices and for the needs of the capital. The manner of
collection, investment, and application of this money forms the subject
of this treatise. It contains, in addition, many other historical
regulations, most of which, however, only held good during the existence
of the second Temple.

# CHAPTER I.

MISHNA: (*a*) On the first day of the month of Adar, warnings are
heralded (from Jerusalem) concerning Shekalim <span
id="fr_1"></span>[a1](#fn_1.md) and Kelayim <span
id="fr_2"></span>[a2](#fn_2.md) (the prohibition concerning the use, for
ploughing together,

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

of an ox with an ass, and the sowing together of different kinds of
seeds). On the fifteenth day of that month the Megillah Esther <span
id="fr_3"></span>[a3](#fn_3.md) is read in the fortified cities; and the
same day the improvement of country roads, <span
id="fr_4"></span>[a4](#fn_4.md) market-places, and legal plunge-baths is
proceeded with. Public affairs are again taken up <span
id="fr_5"></span>[a5](#fn_5.md); at the same time, graves are marked with
lime, <span id="fr_6"></span>[a6](#fn_6.md) and messengers are sent out on
account of possible Kelayim. <span id="fr_7"></span>[a7](#fn_7.md)

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

(*b*) R. Jehudah says: At one time the messengers used to pull out the
Kelayim (illegally mixed seeds) and throw them at the feet of the
owners! The number of the transgressors, however, being constantly on
the increase, the Kelayim were pulled out and thrown into the roads.
Finally, it was determined that the entire fields of such law-breakers
were to be confiscated. <span id="fr_8"></span>[b1](#fn_8.md)

(*c*) On the fifteenth of this month (Adar) the money-changers outside
of Jerusalem seated themselves at their tables. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[c1](#fn_9.md) In the city of Jerusalem, however, they did
not do this until the twenty-fifth of the month. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[c2](#fn_10.md) As soon as the money-changers seated
themselves also in the city, the taking of pledges from

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

the tardy ones commenced. <span id="fr_11"></span>[c3](#fn_11.md) But from
whom were pledges taken? From Levites, Israelites, proselytes, and
freedmen; but not from women, slaves, and minors. If a father, however,
commenced to give a pledge for a minor, he was not allowed to stop. From
priests no pledges were taken, for the sake of peace (and the dignity of
the priests themselves). <span id="fr_12"></span>[c4](#fn_12.md)

(*d*) Said R. Jehudah: Ben Buchri proclaimed the following ordinance in
Yavne (Jamnia): "Any priest paying his shekel commits no wrong." R.
Johanan ben Zakai, however, rejoined: "Not so! (The ordinance should
read:) 'Any priest not paying his shekel, commits a sin.'" <span
id="fr_13"></span>[d1](#fn_13.md) But the priests used to interpret the
following passage to their advantage: It is written \[Leviticus vi.
16\]: "And every meat-offering of a priest shall be wholly burnt, it
shall not be eaten." (They said therefore:) Were we obliged to
contribute (our shekels) how could we eat our <span
id="fr_14"></span>[d2](#fn_14.md) Omer

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

(first sheaves harvested) and the two loaves and the showbread (which
were procured with the shekels of the head-tax)?

(*e*) Although it was ordained that no pledges were to be taken from
women, slaves, and minors, if they offered to contribute, their money
was accepted. From heathens and Samaritans it was not accepted. Nor were
bird-offerings, for men or women afflicted with venereal disease and for
women who had recently been confined, accepted; nor sin and guilt
offerings. <span id="fr_15"></span>[e1](#fn_15.md) Vowed and voluntary
offerings, however, were accepted. <span id="fr_16"></span>[e2](#fn_16.md)
The following is the rule: Everything which was vowed as an offering and
all voluntary offerings were accepted. Anything not vowed for offering
or given voluntarily was not accepted from them (heathens and
Samaritans). So it is explicitly declared in Ezra, for it is written
\[Ezra iv. 3\]: "It is not for *you* and us (both) to build a house unto
our God."

\(f\) The following are obliged to pay a premium <span
id="fr_17"></span>[f1](#fn_17.md) (in addition

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

to the half-shekel): Levites, Israelites, proselytes, and freed. men;
but not (priests,) women, slaves, and minors. If one pay (the
half-shekel) for a priest, woman, slave, or a minor, he is exempt (from
paying the premium); if he pay for himself and another, however, he must
pay a premium for one. R. Meir says: "(He must pay) two premiums. One
who pays a Sela (whole Bible shekel) and receives in return a half
(Bible) shekel must pay two premiums." <span
id="fr_18"></span>[f2](#fn_18.md)

\(g\) If one pay for a poor man, for a neighbor, or for a countryman, he
is exempt from a premium (because it is charity); if he only advances
them the money, he is not exempt. Brothers who (after dividing their
inheritance) have their business in common, or partners, when they
become obliged to pay a premium, are exempt from cattle-tithe. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[g1](#fn_19.md) As long, however, as they must pay
cattle-tithe, they are exempt from a premium. How much does the premium
amount to? According to R. Meir, to one silver Meah (one twenty-fourth
of a shekel); but the sages say, to one-half of a Meah.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[1:a1](shk05.htm#fr_1.md)

# CHAPTER I.

MISHNA *a*. Warnings were heralded from Jerusalem concerning Shekalim on
and after the first of Adar, in order to prepare for the first of
Nissan, before which day the final settlement of Shekalim had to be
made. This was inferred by the Palestinian Talmud from the following
passage \[Exodus xl. 17\]: "And it came to pass in the first month in
the second year, on the first of the month, that the tabernacle was
reared up." This was commented upon by a Boraitha, which stated, that on
the day on which the tabernacle was reared up, the entire sum of the
Shekalim collected was ready for disbursement.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[1:a2](shk05.htm#fr_2.md) Warnings were also
heralded concerning Kelayim, because that month was the time when
ploughing and sowing commenced in Palestine.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[2:a3](shk05.htm#fr_3.md) The Megillah (Book of
Esther) was read on the fifteenth day of this month only in such cities
as were fortified since the time of Joshua the son of Nun; but in such
as were fortified after his day, and in the open cities, it was read on
the fourteenth of the month. No mention is made in the Mishna concerning
the reading on the fourteenth, because, the majority of the cities being
open, or fortified since the time of Joshua ben Nun, it was generally
known, and there was no fear of it being forgotten. In the few fortified
cities, however, it was necessary to remind the inhabitants that the day
on which they were to read the Megillah was the fifteenth. The
Palestinian Talmud (Chapter I., Halakha 2) states, that we are taught by
this Mishna that all commandments which are to be fulfilled on a leap
year in the second Adar should not be fulfilled in the first Adar; but
we cannot see how that can be inferred from this Mishna, although some
commentators have tried to explain it.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[2:a4](shk05.htm#fr_4.md) The rainy season ended by
the first of Adar, and in consequence of the heavy rains the country
roads and market-places were in bad condition. In the month of Nissan,
travel towards Jerusalem was very heavy; hence the warning to improve
the roads, etc., was heralded, The public plunge-baths were also injured
by the rains and had to be repaired, for the sake of the public, to whom
the law prescribes the taking of a legal bath on or before the holidays.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[2:a5](shk05.htm#fr_5.md) The Palestinian Talmud
states, that at that time the courts of law (Beth-din) would meet in
session for the trial of civil suits, criminal cases, and crimes
involving the punishment of stripes; for the redemption of such as had
devoted all their possessions in honor of the Lord, and such as had
given the estimated value of their person, etc.; also for the
performance of the rite of the bitter water (see Numbers v. 12-31), and
for the performance of the rite of breaking the calf's neck (see Dent.
xxi.), and for the rite of the red heifer (see Numbers xix.), and for
the ceremony of piercing a serf's ear (see Exodus xxi.). For all this,
and any other matters that came up before them, the courts of law
assembled in that month.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[2:a6](shk05.htm#fr_6.md) Such graves as had been
injured during the rainy season, and were not marked, had to be restored
and marked, in order that a man be saved the annoyance of becoming
unclean by stepping on a grave. The Palestinian Talmud infers this from
the passage \[Leviticus xiii. 46\]: "Unclean, unclean, shall he call
out," and interprets it to signify that the uncleanness itself should
call out "unclean" and keep men away from its vicinity. For this reason
it was heralded, that the graves were to be marked in order to be a
warning to passers-by that such places were unclean.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[2:a7](shk05.htm#fr_7.md) On account of the severity
of the law concerning Kelayim and the frequency with which that law was
infracted, it was deemed insufficient merely to herald the prohibition,
and messengers were sent out to see the law enforced (Maimonides).

<span id="fn_8"></span>[3:b1](shk05.htm#fr_8.md) MISHNA *b*. R. Jehudah's
dictum does not intend to dispute the foregoing, but merely supplements
it with the statement that the messengers sent out were for the purpose
of punishing the infractors of the law of Kelayim. The Palestinian
Talmud adduces the right of the Beth-din to confiscate property from the
passage \[Ezra x. 8\]: "And that whosoever should not come within three
days, etc., all his substance should be devoted." Whence it may be seen,
that a Beth-din has such power.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[3:c1](shk05.htm#fr_9.md) MISHNA *c*. It was the
custom for money-changers in those days to carry their tables with them,
and hence they were called "the men of the tables." The Mishna relates,
that on the fifteenth of the month the money-changers were ordered to go
out into the rural districts with their tables, in order to provide the
people with the necessary half-shekels; for the tax had to be paid in
half-shekels only.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[3:c2](shk05.htm#fr_10.md) On the twenty-fifth,
when it was high time for payment and the people commenced flocking into
the city of Jerusalem, the moneychangers returned and sat in the court
of the Temple.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[4:c3](shk05.htm#fr_11.md) The taking of pledges
commenced immediately upon the departure of the money-changers from the
rural districts, because, if a man had not paid his half-shekel while
the money-changers were still within his reach, it was obvious that he
either would not or could not pay it, and in consequence a pledge was
taken.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[4:c4](shk05.htm#fr_12.md) According to law, the
priests were also in duty bound to pay the half-shekels, the collection
of which was mainly intended for the purchase of communal sacrifices,
and the priests were naturally included in the community. They, however,
found a defect in the law, and held themselves exempt. In consequence of
their being in authority during the existence of the second Temple, they
were not forced to pay or give pledges, for the sake of harmony.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[4:d1](shk05.htm#fr_13.md) MISHNA *d*. The
difference of opinion between Ben Buchri (who was a priest himself) and
R. Johan ben Zakai is, as can be plainly seen, that Ben Buchri holds,
that according to law the priests are not in duty bound to pay the
half-shekel; but if they do it, they may nevertheless partake of their
Omer, two loaves, and showbread, while R. Johan ben Zakai says, that
they are in duty bound to pay the half-shekel.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[4:d2](shk05.htm#fr_14.md) The priests claim, that
if they were to pay the half-shekel with which the Omer, etc., is
bought, they would naturally have a share in it, and they would eat
their share, which, as a priest's offering, must not be eaten by any
one. This is, however, an unjust claim; for the majority is considered,
and the priests were by far in the minority. As the priests, however,
were in charge of the affairs of state, they interpreted the law to suit
themselves, and for the sake of peace they were not disturbed.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[5:e1](shk05.htm#fr_15.md) MISHNA *e*. This clause
of the Mishna refers, according to the Palestinian Talmud and
Maimonides, to Samaritans only and not to heathens, while the sin and
guilt offerings were accepted from Samaritans but not from heathens,
because the latter had not the same laws as the Israelites as regards
sin-offerings. The Samaritans, however, claiming to be Israelites, were
allowed to bring their sin and guilt offerings. The reason, however,
that bird-offerings were not accepted from the Samaritans was because,
in the first place, an offering for a person afflicted with venereal
disease had to be brought in the form of a sheep; but if the person
could not afford a sheep, birds answered the purpose. The Samaritans,
however, were not considered trustworthy, and it was feared that they
might bring a wrong offering (*i.e.*, an offering of less value than
they could afford).

<span id="fn_16"></span>[5:e2](shk05.htm#fr_16.md) These were accepted from
heathens also, because such offerings were for forgiveness of sins in
general, and in that respect all men are equal.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[5:f1](shk05.htm#fr_17.md) MISHNA *f*. The shekel
mentioned in the Bible is equivalent to the Sela mentioned in the
Mishna, and is worth two shekels of the Mishna. The half-shekel of the
Bible was worth (according to Maimonides) the weight of 192 grains of
barley in silver, and, for fear that the shekel of the Mishna of that
time was perhaps a trifle less than the above weight, a small coin was
prescribed to be paid in addition to the above shekel, and which was
named from the Greek Colobbus (χόλλῦβος) He who gave the half-shekel
voluntarily, and not because he was obliged to pay it, was exempt from
paying the above "Colobbus." Those of the priests who, regardless of the
<span id="page_6">p. 6</span> claim that they were not obliged to pay
the half-shekel, paid it nevertheless, were exempt from the above
premium for the sake of peace.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[6:f2](shk05.htm#fr_18.md) One in addition to the
half-shekel and one for the exchange.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[6:g1](shk05.htm#fr_19.md) MISHNA g. Cattle-tithe
must be paid by a man only from such young as his own cattle calve, but
not from the calves which he purchases elsewhere. If two brothers
inherit cattle or calves from their father, they must pay cattle-tithe,
because the cattle are regarded as still their father's. If they have
divided their inheritance, even though they shared alike, they are both
exempt from payment, because it is regarded as if one brother had bought
the cattle from the other. (The same refers to partners. As long as they
are in partnership they are liable for cattle-tithe from such young as
is calved by their own cattle, but if the partners dissolve even after
the cattle had calved, they are exempt, because it is regarded as if one
partner had purchased his share from the other.) Now, it is obvious that
when the two brothers are still partners and liable for cattle-tithe
they are regarded as one, and by paying one Sela for both are exempt
from premiums, because the money is still considered as their father's.
(This explanation is taken from Rashi in Tract Chulin.) As soon,
however, as they are exempt from cattle-tithe., they have nothing more
in common, hence must pay a half-shekel each, and thus must also pay the
premium.
