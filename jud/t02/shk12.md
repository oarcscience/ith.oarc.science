# CHAPTER VIII.

MISHNA: (*a*) All spittle <span id="fr_90"></span>[a1](#fn_90.md) to be
found in Jerusalem is considered clean, except such as is found at the
upper market (for this place was secluded and those afflicted with
venereal diseases were in the habit of going there). Such is the
teaching of R. Meir. The sages say: In the middle of the street it is at
ordinary times unclean, and at the sides of the streets, clean. During
the festivals, spittle found in the middle of the street is clean; at
the sides it is unclean, because such as are unclean on account of their
minority usually walk at the sides of the street.

(*b*) All utensils found on the way towards the plunge-bath, in
Jerusalem, are unclean; those found on the way from the plunge-bath are
clean: for they were not carried down to the plunge-bath the same way
that these were carried up from the plunge-bath. So teaches R. Meir. R.
Jose says: "All are clean, with the exception of such baskets, spades,
and pickaxes as are used for the bones of the dead." <span
id="fr_91"></span>[b1](#fn_91.md)

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

(*c*) If a butchering-knife be found on the fourteenth day of Nissan, a
Passover-offering may be slaughtered with it forthwith. If it be found
on the thirteenth, it must be again submerged. <span
id="fr_92"></span>[c1](#fn_92.md) A severing-knife must be submerged both
if found on the thirteenth or fourteenth. If the fourteenth, however,
fall on a Sabbath, it may be used for slaughtering forthwith; so also if
it be found on the fifteenth: if it be found together with a
butchering-knife, it is treated just like the latter.

(*d*) If a curtain in the Sanctuary become defiled through some minor
uncleanness, <span id="fr_93"></span>[d1](#fn_93.md) it is submerged on the
inside of the outer court, and may be put back in its place; if it
become defiled through a principal uncleanness, it must be submerged on
the outside and then stretched on the rampart, because sunset must be
awaited. At the time it is submerged for the first time (when new), it
should be spread out on the roof of the gallery, in order that the
people may see the beauty of the work.

(*e*) R. Simeon, son of Gamaliel, says in the name of R. Simeon, son of
the assistant high priest, that the curtain was one

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

span thick, woven on seventy-two warp-cords, each cord twisted out of
twenty threads; it was forty ells long and twenty ells wide, and made
(worth) of eighty-two myriads (Dinars). <span
id="fr_94"></span>[e1](#fn_94.md) Two such curtains were made yearly: three
hundred priests were required to submerge it.

(*f*) If meat of the Holy of Holies <span id="fr_95"></span>[f1](#fn_95.md)
became defiled, be it through a minor or a principal uncleanness, in the
corridor or on the outside, according to the school of Shamai it must
all be burnt in the court (in a place appointed for that purpose),
except such as had been defiled by a principal uncleanness on the
outside (of the court); according to the school of Hillel, everything is
burnt on the outside except such as had been defiled by a minor
uncleanness on the inside.

(*g*) R. Eliezer says: "Anything that has become defiled through a
principal uncleanness, on the outside or on the inside, is burnt on the
outside; anything that has become defiled through a minor uncleanness,
either on the inside or the outside, must be burnt on the inside." R.
Aqiba says: "In the place where a thing became defiled, there must it
also be burnt."

(*h*) The joints of the daily sacrifice were laid down underneath the
half of the altar-stairs on the westerly (according to others on the
easterly) side; those of the additional offerings on the easterly
(others say oil the westerly) side. The sacrifices of the new moon were
placed above the railing (others say beneath) on the altar. <span
id="fr_96"></span>[h1](#fn_96.md) The payment of Shekalim was only
obligatory during the time that the Temple stood; the tithes from grain,
cattle, and the deliverance of the firstlings were in force during the
existence of the Temple and even after the Temple. <span
id="fr_97"></span>[h2](#fn_97.md)--If

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

one sanctify Shekalim or firstlings, they are considered sanctified. R.
Simeon says: "If one say, firstlings shall be holy, they are not
sanctified (because no Temple exists)."

### APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VI., MISHNA *a*.

FROM the teaching of this Mishna, we may conclude that the number system
of Pythagoras was known and prevailed in the times of the Sages of the
Mishna, and accordingly the number, 13 was deemed inauspicious even in
the earliest days.

Therefore many religious ceremonies were established with the express
view of convincing the people of the absurdity of their belief.

It also seems probable that the Sages themselves entertained the
superstition, and that they adopted the number 13 in the religious
ceremonies as a cure for the mischief believed to have, been produced by
the inauspicious number.

# CHAPTER VIII.

MISHNA *a*. Concerning this spittle, see Leviticus xv. 8. It being
impossible that, of all the people congregated in Jerusalem at the times
of the festivals, there should not be some who had running issues and
whose spittle was unclean, regulations were made where such men were to
walk and where not. These regulations are cited by the Mishna. R. Meir
said, that the upper market was the place designated for them, but the
sages differ with him, and say, that the regulation was for the healthy
men to walk in the middle of the street and the unclean at the sides
during the festivals; but the whole year, the order was reversed. It is
therefore self-evident, that, wherever the unclean walk, one is liable
to contract uncleanness.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[33:b1](shk12.htm#fr_91.md) MISHNA *b*. This Mishna
is explained by Maimonides and translated by Yost in a different manner
than we have rendered it; namely: "All utensils found wrong side up on
the way to the plunge-bath are unclean, and those found right side up
are clean." This <span id="page_34">p. 34</span> explanation is very
complicated, and not in accordance with the literal text and other
sources of explanation. Hence we simply translated the literal text and
deem it correct. As for the last three articles, they are always
unclean, on account of being used for bones of the dead; hence, in our
opinion, they were never submerged. (See also commentary of Israel
Lipshuetz, who also interprets it according to our explanation.)

<span id="fn_92"></span>[34:c1](shk12.htm#fr_92.md) MISHNA *c*. A
butchering-knife, being in constant use, is always considered clean, and
hence there is no necessity of submerging it. If, however, it be found
on the thirteenth, when there is still one day's time, it should be
submerged for the sake of precaution. A severing-knife, however, is
considered the same as any other vessel, and is treated accordingly.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[34:d1](shk12.htm#fr_93.md) MISHNA *d*. For the
explanation of the term "minor uncleanness," as used in this Mishna, it
is necessary to state the different degrees of uncleanness, which are as
follows: A corpse is called "the grandparent of uncleanness." One who
touches a corpse becomes "a father of uncleanness"; anything touching
the latter is, in turn, "a child of (or first of) uncleanness"; anything
touched by this latter is a "second of uncleanness"; and so forth, "a
third" and "a fourth." (See Tract Taharoth.) In this Mishna a minor
uncleanness refers to a first of uncleanness, and a principal
uncleanness to a father of uncleanness.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[35:e1](shk12.htm#fr_94.md) MISHNA e. The
Palestinian Talmud asserts, that the amount of the cost of and the
number of priests required to submerge the curtain is somewhat
exaggerated; but, according to Dr. Büchler's "Priester und Cultus," the
number of priests is not an exaggeration; and as for the cost, if the
smallest existing coin be used for calculation (as in former times the
sou in France, so also was the myriad mentioned in the Mishna), not even
the sum will be exaggerated.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[35:f1](shk12.htm#fr_95.md) MISHNA *f*. For
instance, the meat of the sacrifice mentioned in Leviticus vii. 6.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[35:h1](shk12.htm#fr_96.md) MISHNA h. This will be
explained in Tract Midoth.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[35:h2](shk12.htm#fr_97.md) Because the Levites
received their sustenance from this source, and having inherited no land
from their ancestors, they were <span id="page_36">p. 36</span>
supported even after the destruction of the Temple by the same means.
The details will be found in Tracts Becharath, Maasroth, etc.
