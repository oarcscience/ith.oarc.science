### CHAPTER X.

1\. Everything suited for causing legal uncleanness in that which is
trodden must be expelled from the ceremony of purification, whether it
be unclean or clean, and man likewise. "Everything suited for producing
defilement of the dead, whether it be unclean or clean?" R. Eliezer
said, "it is not expelled." R. Joshua said, "it is expelled." But the
Sages say, "if unclean it is expelled, but the clean thing is not
expelled."

2\. He who is cleansed for purification, when he touches that which is
expelled, is unclean. A jug for purification, when it touches that which
is expelled, is unclean. He who is cleansed for purification, when he
touches eatable or drinkable things with his hand, is unclean. "But with
his foot?" "He is clean." "The thing was moved with his hand?" R. Joshua
pronounces him "unclean;" but the Sages pronounce him "clean."

3\. "An earthen vessel for purification, which touched a creeping
thing?" "It is clean." "It was placed upon it?" R. Eleazar pronounces it
"clean;" but the Sages pronounce it "unclean." "It touched eatable or
drinkable things, or holy writings?" "It is clean." "It was placed upon
them?" R. José pronounced it "clean;" but the Sages pronounced it
"unclean."

4\. "When he who was cleansed for purification touched a fireplace <span
id="fr_658"></span>[1](#fn_651.md) with his hand?" "He is unclean." "But
with his foot?" "He is clean." "He stood on the fireplace, and stretched
his hand with the jug, and the water and ashes in it beyond the
fireplace, and also the shoulder pole, which he placed over the
fireplace, and on it were two

earthen vessels, one on either side?" R. Akiba pronounces him
"clean;" <span id="fr_659"></span>[1](#fn_652.md) but the Sages pronounce
him "unclean."

5\. "He stood outside the fireplace, and stretched his hand to the
window, and took the jug (with water and ashes) and passed it over the
fireplace?" R. Akiba pronounces him "unclean," but the Sages pronounce
him "clean." But he who was cleansed for purification, may stand over
the fireplace, and in his hand an empty vessel cleansed for purification
or (one) with water without ashes.

6\. "When a jug for purification touched (one) in which there were holy
things, or one in which there was an heave-offering?" "The one for
purification is unclean; but those of the holy things and the
heave-offering are clean." "If both be in his two hands?" "Both are
unclean." "If both be in two papers?" "Both are clean." "If the one for
purification be in paper, and the one for the heave-offering be in his
hand?" "Both are unclean." "If the one for the heave-offering be in
paper, and the one for purification be in his hand?" "Both are clean."
R. Joshua said, "the one for the purification is unclean." "They were
placed on the ground and one touched them?" "The one for purification is
unclean, the one containing the holy things, and the one with the
heave-offering are clean." "He moved them?" R. Joshua pronounces them
"unclean," but the Sages pronounce them "clean."
