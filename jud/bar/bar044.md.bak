### CHAPTER VI.

1\. These things in the passover abrogate the command against work on
the Sabbath: its slaughtering, and the sprinkling of its blood, and
purging its inwards, and incensing its fat. But its roasting and the
rinsing of its inwards do not abrogate the Sabbath. But to carry it, and
to bring it beyond a Sabbath day's journey, and to cut off its wen, do
not abrogate the Sabbath. Rabbi Eleazar said, "they abrogate it."

2\. Said Rabbi Eleazar, "and is not this the teaching? when slaughtering
is work it abrogates the Sabbath. Things which are for 'resting' do not
abrogate the Sabbath." <span id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_156.md) To him said
Rabbi Joshua, "a holiday will give the proof; the Sages permitted that
which is work, and they forbade that which is resting." Rabbi Eleazar
said to him, "what do you mean, Joshua? what comparison is there between
a command and that which is voluntary?" Rabbi Akiba answered and said,
"sprinkling <span id="fr_160"></span>[2](#fn_157.md) will give the proof,
because it is a positive command, and it is for 'resting,' and does not
abrogate the Sabbath; but you should not wonder at this, even though it
be a command, as it is for 'resting,' and does not abrogate the
Sabbath." Rabbi Eleazar said to him, "and on that I form my judgment,
when slaughtering is work it abrogates the Sabbath; sprinkling, which is
for 'resting,' does it not teach that it abrogates the Sabbath?" Rabbi
Akiba said to him, "on the contrary, if sprinkling, which is for
'resting,' does not abrogate the Sabbath, slaughtering, which is for
work, is it not the teaching? should not abrogate the Sabbath." Rabbi
Eleazar said to him, "Akiba, thou hast annulled what is written in the
Law, 'between the evenings,' 'in its appointed time,' whether it be a
week day or a Sabbath." He said to him, "My teacher, give me proof of an
appointed time for these things, like the appointed time for

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

slaughtering the passover-offering?" The rule is, said R. Akiba, "all
work for the passover which it is possible to do on the eve of the
Sabbath does not abrogate the Sabbath; slaughtering, which it is
impossible to do on the eve of the passover which falls on a Sabbath,
abrogates the Sabbath."

3\. "When do men bring with the passover a feast-offering?" "When the
passover falls on a week-day, when those who offer it are legally clean,
and when the lamb is too small for the eaters. But when the passover
falls on a Sabbath, when the lamb is too much for the eaters, and there
is legal uncleanness, they should not bring with it a feast-offering."

4\. The feast-offering <span id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_158.md) came from
flocks, from herds, from sheep and goats, from rams and ewes, and it may
be eaten during a period of two days and one night.

5\. "The passover which was slaughtered without the proper intention on
a Sabbath?" "The offerer of it is indebted for a sin-offering." "And all
the other sacrifices which he slaughtered for the passover?" "If they be
not suitable for it he is guilty." "And if they be suitable?" Rabbi
Eleazar declares him "indebted for a sin-offering." But R. Joshua "frees
him." Said Rabbi Eleazar, "what! if the passover which was allowed for
proper intention when the offerer changed its intention, makes him
guilty; is it not the teaching that sacrifices, which are disallowed for
want of proper intention when the offerer changed their intention, make
him also guilty?" Rabbi Joshua said to him, "no; if thou saidst in the
passover when he changed its intention it is changed to a thing
disallowed, thou wilt say in the other sacrifices when he changed their
intention they are changed to a thing allowed." Rabbi Eleazar said to
him, "the congregational offerings will give the proof, because they are
rendered lawful on the Sabbath by intention, but whoever slaughtered
(another) sacrifice with their intention is guilty." Rabbi Joshua said
to him, "no; if thou sayest so in the congregational offerings, which
are a

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

determined number, thou wilt also say so in the passover sacrifice which
has no determined number." Rabbi Meier said, "even he who slaughtered
other offerings on the Sabbath, with the intention of the congregational
offerings, is free."

6\. "When one slaughtered the passover, but not for its eaters, or not
for those numbered to eat it, for uncircumcised and for unclean
persons?" "He is guilty." "For its eaters and not for its eaters? For
its reckoning and not for its reckoning? For circumcised and
uncircumcised? For clean and unclean?" "He is free." "He slaughtered it,
and it was found blemished?" "He is guilty." "He slaughtered it and it
was found torn in secret?" "He is free." "He slaughtered it, and it
became known that its owners retired from it, or died, or became legally
unclean?" "He is free, because he slaughtered it with lawful
permission."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_156"></span>[106:1](bar044.htm#fr_159.md) The following subtle
discussion arises out of the distinction between "work" forbidden by the
law of God and "resting from work" enjoined by tradition.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[106:2](bar044.htm#fr_160.md) The sprinkling of a
person unclean from touching a dead body when the passover fell on a
Sabbath.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[107:1](bar044.htm#fr_161.md) This refers to the
second chagigah—the feast-offering of individuals on the 15th of Nisan.
It is called by the general name passover, John xviii. 28. Want of
acquaintance with this subject has led some commentators to suppose that
there is a discrepancy between the account of the last passover of our
Lord as related in the Synoptical Gospels, and as recorded by St. John.
