### CHAPTER VI.

1\. The Sages studied in the language of the Mishna; blessed be He who
made choice of them and their learning. R. Meier said, "he who is
engaged in the study of the law for its own sake merits many things, and
not only so, but the whole world is under the greatest obligation to
him; he is called a dear friend, dear to God and dear to mankind; he
rejoices God and rejoices His creatures. It clothes him with meekness
and the fear of God, and directs him to become just, pious, righteous,
and faithful; it removes him from sin, and brings him near to merit, and
the world is benefited by his counsel, sound wisdom, understanding, and
strength; as is said, "Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; I am
understanding, I have strength." <span id="fr_505"></span>[2](#fn_499.md)
It also bestows on him empire, dominion, and perception in judgment. It
reveals the secrets of the law to him, and he shall be an increasing
fountain, and a never-failing river; and it will cause him to

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

be modest, slow to anger, and ready to pardon an injury done to him; and
it will magnify and exalt him above all things."

2\. R. Joshua, son of Levi, said, "every day a Divine voice (bath kol)
proceeds from Mount Horeb, which proclaims and says, 'Woe be to those
who contemn the law; for whoever is not engaged in the study of the law
maybe considered as excommunicate;' for it is said, 'as a jewel of gold
in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without
discretion;' <span id="fr_506"></span>[1](#fn_500.md) and it is said, 'And
the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God,
graven upon the tables.' <span id="fr_507"></span>[2](#fn_501.md) Read not
graven but freedom; for who are counted free but those engaged in the
study of the law; and whoever is engaged in the study of the law is
exalted; as it is said, 'And from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from
Nahaliel to Bamoth.'" <span id="fr_508"></span>[3](#fn_502.md)

3\. He who learns from his companion one chapter, sentence, verse, or
expression, ought to behave towards him with respect; for thus we find
by David, King of Israel, who having learned only two things from
Ahitophel, called him his teacher, guide, and acquaintance, as is said,
"But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
acquaintance." <span id="fr_509"></span>[4](#fn_503.md) Hence it may be
deduced that if David, King of Israel, who having learned only two
things from Ahitophel, called him his "teacher, guide, and
acquaintance," how much more ought he who learns from his companion a
single chapter, sentence, verse, or expression, to show him the utmost
respect? And there is no glory but the knowledge of the law; as is said,
"The wise shall inherit glory;" <span id="fr_510"></span>[5](#fn_504.md)
and the perfect shall inherit the good; but nothing is really good but
the law, as is said, "For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my
law." <span id="fr_511"></span>[6](#fn_505.md)

4\. Thus is the law to be observed: Thou shalt eat bread and salt, and
water by measure shalt thou drink; on the earth shalt thou sleep, and a
life of trouble shalt thou live; and thou shalt labour in the study of
the law. If thou doest thus, thou shalt be happy, and it shall be well
with

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

thee; thou shalt be happy in this world, and it shall be well with thee
in the world to come.

5\. Seek not grandeur for thyself, neither covet more honour than thy
learning merits. Crave not after the tables of kings; for thy table is
greater than their table, and thy crown is greater than their crown; and
the Master who employs thee is faithful to pay thee the reward of thy
labour.

6\. The law is more excellent than the priesthood and royalty; for
royalty is acquired by thirty properties, and the priesthood by
twenty-four; but the law is acquired by forty-eight things, and these
are they,—with study, attention, eloquence; an understanding heart, an
intelligent heart; with dread and meekness, fear and joy; with
attendance on the Sages, the acuteness of companions, and disputations
of the disciples; with sedateness, the study of the Bible, and the
Mishna; in purity, in taking little sleep, in using little discourse, in
being little engaged in traffic, in taking little sport, in enjoying
little delight and little worldly manners; in being slow to anger, in
having a good heart, in having faith in the Sages, and in bearing
chastisements; in being sensible of his situation, and rejoicing in his
portion; in being circumspect in his language, in not pretending to
preeminence, in sincerely loving God, and loving His creatures; in
loving admonition, and that which is right; in avoiding honour, and in
not priding himself on his acquired knowledge; not rejoicing in
pronouncing sentence, in bearing the burden equally with his companion,
and inclining him to merit, and confirming him in the truth and in
peace; is sedate in his study, inquires according to the subject, and
answers according to the constitution; is attentive to study, and
extends it; learns it with a view to the teaching of others, and also
with a view to perform the precepts; increases his teacher's knowledge,
and is attentive to his instruction, and reports everything in the name
of the person who said it; hence it is inferred that whoever reports
anything in the name of the person who said it, procures redemption for
the world, as is said, "And Esther certified the king thereof in
Mordecai's name." <span id="fr_512"></span>[1](#fn_506.md)

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

7\. Great is the law, which bestows life on the doers of it, both in
this world and in the world to come; as is said, "For they are life unto
those that find them, and health to all their flesh." <span
id="fr_513"></span>[1](#fn_507.md) And it is said, "It shall be health to
thy navel, and marrow to thy bones." <span
id="fr_514"></span>[2](#fn_508.md) And it is said, "She is a tree of life
to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is every one that retaineth
her." <span id="fr_515"></span>[3](#fn_509.md) And it is said, "For they
shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy
neck." <span id="fr_516"></span>[4](#fn_510.md) And it is said, "She shall
give to thine head an ornament of grace; a crown of glory shall she
deliver to thee." <span id="fr_517"></span>[5](#fn_511.md) And it is said,
"Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and
honour." <span id="fr_518"></span>[6](#fn_512.md) And it is said, "For
length of days and long life, and peace shall they add to thee." <span
id="fr_519"></span>[7](#fn_513.md)

8\. Rabbi Simeon, son of Judah, in the name of Rabbi Simeon, son of
Jochai, said, “beauty, strength, riches, honour, wisdom, age, hoariness,
and many children, are suitable for the righteous, and suitable for the
world; as is said, “The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found
in the way of righteousness.” <span id="fr_520"></span>[8](#fn_514.md) And
it is said, "Children's children are the crown of old men, and the glory
of children are their fathers." <span id="fr_521"></span>[9](#fn_515.md)
And it is said, "Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed,
when the Lord of Hosts shall reign on Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; and
before his ancients gloriously." <span id="fr_522"></span>[10](#fn_516.md)

9\. Rabbi Simeon, son of Manasya, said, "those seven qualities which the
Sages counted as proper for the righteous, were all established in the
Rabbi (Judah) and his children." Rabbi José, son of Kishma, said, “I was
once travelling along the road and met a certain person, who saluted me
with peace, and I returned his salutation. He then said to me, "Rabbi,
whence art thou?" I answered him, "from a great city abounding in sages
and scribes:" said he to me, "if thou be willing to dwell with us in our
city, then will I give thee a thousand thousand golden dinars, and
precious stones and

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

pearls." To this I answered, "if thou wouldest give me all the silver
and gold, and precious stones and pearls in the world, I would only
dwell in a place where the law is studied; because at the time of man's
departure from this world he is not accompanied either with silver and
gold, and precious stones and pearls, but with the law and good deeds
alone, as is said, 'When thou goest it shall lead thee: when thou
sleepest it shall keep thee: and when thou awakest it shall talk with
thee.'" <span id="fr_523"></span>[1](#fn_517.md) "When thou goest it shall
lead thee," that is in this world. "When thou sleepest it shall keep
thee," in the grave; "and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee," in
the world to come. And thus it is written in the book of Psalms by the
hand of David, king of Israel, "The law of thy mouth is better to me
than thousands of gold and silver." <span
id="fr_524"></span>[2](#fn_518.md) And it is said, "The silver is mine, and
the gold is mine, saith the Lord of Hosts." <span
id="fr_525"></span>[3](#fn_519.md)

10\. Five possessions hath the Holy One, blessed be He, obtained in this
world, and these are they,—the law is one possession; heaven and earth
another; Abraham another; Israel another; and the holy Temple another.
Now whence is it to be proved that the law is one possession? Because it
is written, "The LORD possessed me in the beginning of His way before
His works of old." <span id="fr_526"></span>[4](#fn_520.md) And whence is
it proved that heaven and earth is another possession? Because it is
said, "Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne and the earth is my
footstool; where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the
place of my rest?" <span id="fr_527"></span>[5](#fn_521.md) And it is said,
"O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all;
the earth is full of thy riches." <span id="fr_528"></span>[6](#fn_522.md)
Whence is it proved that Abraham is one possession? Because it is
written, "And he blessed him, and said blessed be Abraham of the most
high God, possessor of heaven and earth." <span
id="fr_529"></span>[7](#fn_523.md) Whence is it proved that Israel is one
possession? Because it is written, "Till thy people pass over, O Lord,
till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased." <span
id="fr_530"></span>[8](#fn_524.md) And it is said, "But to the saints that
are in the earth, and to the

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

excellent, in whom is all my delight." <span
id="fr_531"></span>[1](#fn_525.md) Whence can it be proved that the holy
temple is one possession? Because it is said, "The sanctuary, O Lord,
which thy hands have established." <span id="fr_532"></span>[2](#fn_526.md)
And it is said, "And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary,
even to this mountain which his right hand hath purchased." <span
id="fr_533"></span>[3](#fn_527.md) Everything which God created, he created
but for his glory; as is said, "Every one that is called by my name; for
I have created . him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made
him." <span id="fr_534"></span>[4](#fn_528.md) And the Lord will reign for
ever and ever. R. Chanina, son of Akasea, said, "the Holy One, Blessed
be He, wished to purify Israel, wherefore He magnified for them the Law
and the Commandments, as is said, "The Lord is well pleased for his
righteousness’ sake; he will magnify the law and make it
honourable." <span id="fr_535"></span>[5](#fn_529.md)
