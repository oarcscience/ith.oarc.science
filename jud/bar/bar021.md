## TREATISE II.

<span id="img_06200"></span> ![On the Sabbatical Year.](img/06200.jpg)

### CHAPTER I.

<span class="small">Ploughing—Gardening—Dunging—Removing
Stones—Sowing—Cutting down Trees—Fruits—Buying and Selling—Territory
included in the Sabbatical Year—Produce governed by its Laws—Debts and
Payments.</span>

1\. "How long do men plough in a field with trees on the eve of the
Sabbatical year?" <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37) The school of
Shammai say, "so long as it is useful for the fruit;" but the school of
Hillel say, "till Pentecost," and the words of the one are near to the
words of the other.

2\. "What is a field with trees?" "Three trees to every fifty cubits
square, if they be fit to produce a heap of figs worth sixty Italian
minas;" <span id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38) on their account men can
legally plough the earth for the whole fifty cubits square around them.
Less than for these they may not legally plough, save the extent of the
gatherer of fruit with his basket outwards.

3\. "Whether they be fruitless or fruitful?" "Men may regard them as
though they were fig-trees." "If they be fit to produce a heap of figs
worth sixty Italian minas?" "On their account they may legally plough
the whole fifty cubits square around them. Less than for these they may
not plough, save what is absolutely needful."

4\. "One tree produced a heap of figs, and two trees did not produce it;
or two trees produced it, and one did not produce it?" "Men may not
plough save what is absolutely needful for them, till they be from three
to nine in number."

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "If they be ten?"
"On their account men may legally plough around them the whole fifty
cubits square; and also from ten trees and upwards, whether they produce
or do not produce it." As is said, "in earing-time and in harvest thou
shalt rest." <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39) There is no need to say
earing-time and harvest in the Sabbatical year, but earing-time on the
eve of the Sabbatical year, when it is just entering on the Sabbatical
year; and harvest of the Sabbatical year, which is proceeding towards
the close of the Sabbatical year. Rabbi Ishmael said, "as the
earing-time (mentioned Exod. xxxiv. 21) is voluntary, so the harvest is
voluntary, except the harvest of the (omer) sheaf." <span
id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_40)

5\. "If the three trees belong to three owners?" "They are reckoned as
one, and on their account they may legally plough the whole fifty cubits
square around them." "And how much space must be between them?" Rabban
Simon, the son of Gamaliel, said, "that a bullock with his ploughing
instruments may pass."

6\. "If there be ten saplings dispersed in the fifty cubits square?" "On
their account men may plough the whole fifty cubits square around them
till new year's day." "If they be placed in a row, or rounded like a
crown?" "Men may not plough save what is absolutely needful for them."

7\. The saplings and the gourds are reckoned alike in the fifty cubits
square. Rabban Simon, the son of Gamaliel said, "for every ten cucumbers
in the fifty cubits square, men may plough the fifty cubits square
around them till new year's day."

8\. "How long are they called saplings?" Rabbi Eleazar, the son of
Azariah, said, <span id="fr_41"></span>[3](#fn_41) "till they can be
used." R. Joshua said, "till the age of seven years." R. Akiba said, "a
sapling, as commonly named." "A tree decays and sprouts afresh; when
less than a handbreadth, it is a sapling; when more than a handbreadth,
it is a tree." The words of Rabbi Simon.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_37"></span>[62:1](bar021.htm#fr_37) It has been a subject
of dispute when the Sabbatical year began—whether in Nisan or Tishri.
The weight of evidence is, however, in favour of the civil New Year's
Day, which fell in Tishri (September).

<span id="fn_38"></span>[62:2](bar021.htm#fr_38) An Italian mina perhaps
= a denarius. If so, the heap would be worth about £1 : 17 : 6.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[63:1](bar021.htm#fr_39) Exod. xxxiv. 21.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[63:2](bar021.htm#fr_40) Lev. xxiii. 10. The
omer or "wave sheaf" at the Passover, and the two wave loaves, at
Pentecost, were to be made from grain grown in the field during the
Sabbatical year. It was also allowed to till sufficient land to pay
taxes.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[63:3](bar021.htm#fr_41) Lev. xix. 23-25.
