### CHAPTER XI.

THE ALTAR OF INCENSE was in length a cubit, and in breadth a cubit, and
in height two cubits, as is said, "And thou shalt make an altar to burn
incense upon; of shittim-wood shalt thou make it. A cubit shall be the
length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof: four square shall it
be: and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall
be of the same." <span id="fr_788"></span>[5](#fn_780.md) And it was all
overlaid with gold, as is said, "And thou shalt overlay it with
gold." <span id="fr_789"></span>[6](#fn_781.md) This altar had three names,
the altar of incense, the altar of gold, the inner altar. <span
class="smallcaps">The Altar of Burnt-Offerings</span> was in length five
cubits, and in breadth five cubits, and in height three cubits, as is
said, "And he

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>.

made the altar of burnt-offering of shittim-wood: five cubits was the
length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it was four square;
and three cubits the height thereof." <span
id="fr_790"></span>[1](#fn_782.md) The words of Rabbi Meier. To him said
Rabbi José, "from hearing what is said five by five do we not know that
it is four square? What is the meaning of saying four square?" "It is
superfluous, save for identification in pronouncing with regard to it an
equal decision. It is said here four square, and there four square."
"What four square is meant there?" "That its height is double its
breadth, even the four square mentioned here means that its height is
double its breadth." Rabbi Maier said to him, "if it be according to thy
words, it follows that the altar is higher than the curtains." Rabbi
Josh answered him, "and is it not already said, 'And the hangings of the
court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court, which is
by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about.'" <span
id="fr_791"></span>[2](#fn_783.md) As the tabernacle was ten cubits broad,
so the altar of burnt-offerings was ten cubits broad. A painted line
girdled it in the middle to divide between the blood (sprinkled) above,
and the blood (sprinkled) below. The painted line and downwards was five
cubits. The foundation was a cubit. And three cubits was the compass,
and the circuit was a cubit, and there they put the blood sprinkled
below. The painted line and upwards was five cubits,—a cubit the horns,
and three cubits the compass, and one cubit the circuit. And there they
put the blood which was sprinkled above. And the blood intended to be
sprinkled on the painted line and downwards, if it were put on the
painted line and upwards, was worthless. And the blood that was intended
to be [sprinkled](errata.htm#13.md) above the painted line, if it were put
on the painted line and downwards, was worthless. The altar which Moses
made in the wilderness was in height ten cubits, and the one which
Solomon made was in height ten cubits, and the one which the children of
the captivity made was in height ten cubits, and the one prepared for
the Future, its height is ten cubits. The altar of burnt-offerings

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

was placed in the midst of the court (with) its ascent on the south,
with the laver on the west, with the slaughterhouse on the north, and
all the Israelites to the east, as is said, "And all the congregation
drew near and stood before the Lord." <span
id="fr_792"></span>[1](#fn_784.md) This altar had three names, the altar of
burnt-offering, the altar of brass, the outer altar.
