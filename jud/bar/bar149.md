### CHAPTER XIII.

"How did the Levites guard the tabernacle?" "The family of Kohath
watched on the south, as is said, 'The families of the sons of Kohath
shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward.' <span
id="fr_803"></span>[2](#fn_795) And they were overseers of the vessels
of the ark, as is said, 'And their charge shall be the ark, and the
table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the
sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging and all the
[service](errata.htm#14) thereof.' <span id="fr_804"></span>[3](#fn_796)
Outside of them were the three tribes of Reuben, Simeon, Levi. The
family of Gershon watched in the west, as is said, 'The families of the
Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward.' <span
id="fr_805"></span>[4](#fn_797) And they were intrusted with all the
vessels of the tabernacle, as is said, 'And they shall bear the curtains
of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation.' <span
id="fr_806"></span>[5](#fn_798) Outside of them were the three tribes of
Ephraim, and Manasseh, and Benjamin. The family of Merari watched on the
north, as is said, 'And the chief of the house of the father of the
families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on
the side of the tabernacle northward.' <span
id="fr_807"></span>[6](#fn_799) And they were intrusted with the taches,
and boards, and bars, and pillars, and the sockets of the tabernacle, as
is said, 'And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall
be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars
thereof, and the sockets thereof.' <span id="fr_808"></span>[7](#fn_800)
And outside of them were the three tribes of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali.
On the east were Moses, Aaron, and their families, as is said, 'But
those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, even before the
tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall be Moses and Aaron and
his sons.' <span id="fr_809"></span>[8](#fn_801) And

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

outside of them were the three tribes of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulon.
The whole encampment of Israel was twelve miles. The standard of Judah
was four miles, and the encampment of the Levites, and the encampment of
the SHECHINAH, four miles. The standard of Reuben was four miles. The
standard of Ephraim was four miles. The encampment of the Levites and
the encampment of the SHECHINAH was four miles. And the encampment of
Dan was four miles. It follows *that* the four corners of the tabernacle
were four encampments for service on every side, as is said, 'Then the
tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the
Levites in the midst of the camp; as they encamp so shall they set
forward, every man in his place by their standards.' <span
id="fr_810"></span>[1](#fn_802) So soon as Israel set forward, the
pillar of cloud which was standing still rolled up and spread out over
the children of Judah like a kind of beam. The (trumpet) sounded, and
blew an alarm, and sounded, and the standard of Judah moved forward
first, as is said, 'In the first place went the standard of the camp of
the children of Judah according to their armies.' <span
id="fr_811"></span>[2](#fn_803) At once Aaron and his sons entered (the
Tabernacle) and took down the vail, and with it they covered the ark, as
is said, 'And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come and his
sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of
testimony with it.' <span id="fr_812"></span>[3](#fn_804) The (trumpet)
sounded, and blew an alarm, and sounded. And the standard of the
encampment of Reuben set forward. At once the sons of Gershon, and the
sons of Merari entered, and took down the tabernacle, and loaded it on
the waggon. And they set up the tabernacle before the sons of Kohath
came, as is said, 'And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the
sanctuary; and the other did set up the tabernacle against they
came.' <span id="fr_813"></span>[4](#fn_805) And the trumpet sounded,
and blew an alarm, and sounded, and the standard of Ephraim moved
forward; the children of Kohath entered and took down the holy vessels,
and loaded them on their shoulders, as is said, 'And when Aaron and his
sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary and

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after
that the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it.' <span
id="fr_814"></span>[1](#fn_806) The (trumpet) sounded, and blew an
alarm, and sounded. And the standard of Dan moved forward, as is said,
'And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward.' <span
id="fr_815"></span>[2](#fn_807) It follows that two standards were in
front, and two standards were in the rear, and the encampment of the
Levites, and the encampment of the SHECHINAH was in the middle, as is
said, 'Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with
the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp.' <span
id="fr_816"></span>[3](#fn_808) And as they encamped, so they set
forward, as is said, 'As they encamp, so shall they set forward.' Israel
set forward by three commands, by command of the HOLY BLESSED ONE, by
command of Moses, and by command of the trumpets." "Whence know we the
command of the HOLY BLESSED ONE?" "As is said, 'At the commandment of
the Lord, the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of
the Lord they pitched,'" <span id="fr_817"></span>[4](#fn_809) etc. "By
the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses." <span
id="fr_818"></span>[5](#fn_810) "By commandment of Moses—how?" "Moses
said in the evening, 'early in the morning you must go forward.'" At
once the Israelites began to gather their cattle, and prepared their
furniture for the march. "By commandment of the trumpets whence know we
it?" "As is said, 'Make thee two trumpets of silver, etc., that thou
mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying
of the camps.'" <span id="fr_819"></span>[6](#fn_811) "How?" "The
trumpets sounded, blew an alarm, and sounded three blasts for every
standard." Rabbi Judah said, "there were three blasts for every tribe."
