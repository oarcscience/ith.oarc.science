### CHAPTER IV.

1\. On that day <span id="fr_679"></span>[1](#fn_672.md) they voted and
decided, "that a foot-bath containing from two logs to nine cabs, <span
id="fr_680"></span>[2](#fn_673.md) which was split, <span
id="fr_681"></span>[3](#fn_674.md) may become unclean from pressure." <span
id="fr_682"></span>[4](#fn_675.md) although R. Akibah says, "that a
foot-bath is as its name." <span id="fr_683"></span>[5](#fn_676.md)

2\. On that day they said, "that all sacrifices offered without due
intention are allowed, but they do not absolve the owners from their
obligation, except the passover-offering, and the sin-offering—the
passover-offering in its time, and the sin-offering at all times." R.
Eleazar says, "also the trespass-offering, the passover-offering in its
time, and the sin or trespass-offering at all times." R. Simeon, the son
of Azai, said, "I received it by tradition from the mouth of the
seventy-two elders, on the day they inducted R. Eleazar the son of Azai
into the president's seat, that all sacrifices offered without due
intention, are allowed, but they do not absolve the owners from their
obligation, except the passover-offering, and the sin-offering." The son
of Azai only added the burnt-offering, but the Sages did not agree with
him.

3\. On that day they said, "how is it with Ammon and Moab <span
id="fr_684"></span>[6](#fn_677.md) in the Sabbatical year?" R. Tarphon
decided "they must pay tithes for the poor:" <span
id="fr_685"></span>[7](#fn_678.md) but R. Eleazar, son of Azariah, decided
"second tithes." <span id="fr_686"></span>[8](#fn_679.md) R. Ishmael then
said, "Eleazar, son of Azariah, it behoves thee to prove it, for thou

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

addest to the burden (of the Law); and whoever adds to the burden (of
the Law) it behoves him to prove it." R. Eleazar, son of Azariah, said
to him, "Ishmael, my brother, I have not changed from the order of the
years, <span id="fr_687"></span>[1](#fn_680.md) but my brother Tarphon has
changed, therefore it behoves him to prove it." R. Tarphon replied,
"Egypt is out of the land, and Ammon and Moab are out of the land: as
Egypt pays tithes for the poor in the Sabbatical year, so Ammon and Moab
pay tithes for the poor in the Sabbatical year." R. Eleazar, son of
Azariah, replied, "Babylon is out of the land, and Ammon and Moab are
out of the land; even as Babylon pays second tithes in the Sabbatical
year, so Ammon and Moab pay second tithes in the Sabbatical year." R.
Tarphon replied, "Egypt being near, is subject to tithes for the poor,
in order that the poor in Israel may be supported in the Sabbatical
year; so Ammon and Moab, which are near, must also be subject to tithes
for the poor, in order that the poor in Israel may be supported in the
Sabbatical year." R. Eleazar, the son of Azariah, replied, "thou seekest
to increase money, but thou only losest souls; wouldest thou be the
cause that heaven should neither send down dew nor rain, as is said,
'Will a man rob God?' Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we
robbed thee? In tithes and offerings." <span
id="fr_688"></span>[2](#fn_681.md) R. Joshua said, “behold I will answer
for my brother Tarphon, but not according to the sense of his
words—“Egypt is a new arrangement, Babylon is an old arrangement; the
judgment before us is a new arrangement. Let the new arrangement be
judged from the new arrangement, but let not a new arrangement be judged
from an old arrangement. Egypt is an arrangement by the elders (of the
Sanhedrin), but Babylon is an arrangement by the prophets—the judgment
before us is an arrangement by the elders. Let therefore the arrangement
by the elders be judged from an arrangement by the elders; but let not
an

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

arrangement by the elders be judged from an arrangement by prophets.”
They voted and decided "that Ammon and Moab must pay tithes for the poor
in the Sabbatical year." When R. José, son of Dormiskith, came to R.
Eleazar at Lydda, he said to him, "what had you new in the college
to-day?" He answered, "they voted and decided that Ammon and Moab must
pay tithes in the Sabbatical year." R. Eleazar wept and said, "'The
secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and He will show them His
covenant.' <span id="fr_689"></span>[1](#fn_682.md) Go and tell them, be
not anxious about your vote, for I received it by tradition from Rabban
Johanan; the son of Zachai, who heard it from his teacher, up to the
decision of Moses from Sinai, that Ammon and Moab must pay tithes to the
poor, in the Sabbatical year."

3\. On that day came Judah, an Ammonitish proselyte, and stood before
them in the college. He said to them, "how am I to come into the
congregation?" Rabban Gamaliel said to him, "thou art forbidden." R.
Joshua said to him; "thou art allowed." Rabban Gamaliel said, "the
Scripture says, 'An Ammonite, or Moabite shall not enter into the
congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation etc,'" <span
id="fr_690"></span>[2](#fn_683.md) To him said R. Joshua, “are then the
Ammonites or Moabites still in their own land? Sennacherib, King of
Assyria, aforetime came up, and commingled the nations, as is said, “And
I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their
treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant
(*man*).” <span id="fr_691"></span>[3](#fn_684.md) Rabban Gamaliel said to
him, "the Scripture says, 'And afterwards I will bring again the
captivity of the children of Ammon;' <span
id="fr_692"></span>[4](#fn_685.md) and they are already returned." To him
said R. Joshua, "the Scripture says, 'And I will bring again the
captivity of my people of Israel, <span id="fr_693"></span>[5](#fn_686.md)
and Judah.' But they are not yet returned." And they allowed him to come
into the congregation.

4\. The Chaldee passages in Ezra and Daniel render the hands unclean.
Chaldee written in Hebrew, and Hebrew

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

written in Chaldee, or in Hebrew <span id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_687.md)
do not render the hands unclean. In no case do they cause uncleanness,
unless the writing be Assyrian, on parchment with ink.

5\. The Sadducees said, "we blame you Pharisees, because you say sacred
Scriptures render the hands unclean, but the books Hameram <span
id="fr_695"></span>[2](#fn_688.md) do not render the hands unclean." Rabban
Jochanan, the son of Zachai, said, "and have we nothing else against the
Pharisees but this? Behold they say, 'that the bones of an ass are
clean, but the bones of Jochanan the high priest are unclean.'" They
said to him, "according to their value is their uncleanness, so that no
one may make the bones of his father and mother into spoons." He said to
them, "so (are) the sacred Scriptures: according to their value is their
uncleanness. The books Hameram, which are not valued, do not render the
hands unclean."

6\. The Sadducees said, "we blame you Pharisees, that you declare the
stream flowing (from a clean into an unclean vessel) to be clean." The
Pharisees said, "we blame you Sadducees, that you declare a stream of
water flowing from a graveyard to be clean." The Sadducees said, "we
blame you Pharisees, because you say, if my ox or my ass cause damage,
we are responsible; but if my slave or my bondwoman cause damage, we are
free. What! if I be responsible for my ox and my ass, for which I have
no obligation, I am bound for my slave or bondwoman for whom I have
obligation. It is just that I should be bound for their damages." They
said to them "no! if you speak of my ox and my ass which have no
knowledge, as you speak of my slave and bondwoman who have knowledge:
then, if I offend them, they may go and set fire to the stacks of corn
of another, and I should be bound to pay."

7\. A Galilean Sadducee said, "I blame you Pharisees,

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

because you write the name of the reigning sovereign in the letter of
divorce with Moses." The Pharisees said, “we blame you Galilean
Sadducee, that you write the sovereign on the same page with the NAME,
and not only so, but you write the sovereign above, and the name below,
as is said, “And Pharaoh said, who is the Lord, that I should obey his
voice to let Israel go.” <span id="fr_696"></span>[1](#fn_689.md) But when
he was punished, what did he say? “The LORD is righteous.” <span
id="fr_697"></span>[2](#fn_690.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_672"></span>[329:1](bar136.htm#fr_679.md) When R. Eleazar, the
son of Azariah, was made president of the school in Jamnia.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[329:2](bar136.htm#fr_680.md) A cab is about three
pints.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[329:3](bar136.htm#fr_681.md) And could not
contain water enough to wash one foot.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[329:4](bar136.htm#fr_682.md) Of an unclean
person.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[329:5](bar136.htm#fr_683.md) It continues as long
as its name, and as such cannot become unclean from pressure.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[329:6](bar136.htm#fr_684.md) *i.e.* With
Israelites dwelling there.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[329:7](bar136.htm#fr_685.md) Tithe for the poor
could be eaten anywhere.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[329:8](bar136.htm#fr_686.md) Second tithes could
only be eaten in Jerusalem, Deut. xiv. 22, 23.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[330:1](bar136.htm#fr_687.md) The sixth year was
fixed for the tithe to the poor, consequently in countries outside the
land of Israel, and not subject to the Sabbatical rest, Israelites
should pay the second tithe.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[330:2](bar136.htm#fr_688.md) Malachi iii. 8. It
is assumed that the prophet means the consecrated second tithe, and not
the unconsecrated tithe for the poor.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[331:1](bar136.htm#fr_689.md) Psalm xxv. 10.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[331:2](bar136.htm#fr_690.md) Deut. xxiii. 3.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[331:3](bar136.htm#fr_691.md) Isaiah x. 13.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[331:4](bar136.htm#fr_692.md) Jer. xlix. 6.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[331:5](bar136.htm#fr_693.md) Amos ix. 14.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[332:1](bar136.htm#fr_694.md) The ancient Hebrew
letters are now called Samaritan. They are still used for writing by the
small community of Samaritans who dwell in Nablûs, in the Holy Land. The
Jews now use the Chaldee characters; and the Talmud therefore errs in
calling the old national letters Assyrian.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[332:2](bar136.htm#fr_695.md) Some suppose the
writings of Homer are meant; others think that these were books against
revealed religion.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[333:1](bar136.htm#fr_696.md) Ex. v. 2. The name
of [Pharaoh](errata.htm#7.md) cannot be considered an insult to Moses,
since it precedes the name of God.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[333:2](bar136.htm#fr_697.md) Ex. ix. 27. This is
merely added to avoid ending with [Pharaoh's](errata.htm#8.md) blasphemy.
