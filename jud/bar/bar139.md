### CHAPTER III.

There were provided eleven curtains of goats’ hair, and the length of
every one of them was thirty cubits, as is said, "And thou shalt make
curtains of goats’ (hair) to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven
curtains shalt thou

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

make. The length of one curtain (shall be) thirty cubits." <span
id="fr_713"></span>[1](#fn_706.md) And they were coupled in two vails, one
of five, and one of six, as is said, "And thou shalt couple five
curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves," <span
id="fr_714"></span>[2](#fn_707.md) and they were coupled with fifty loops,
as is said, "And he made fifty loops upon the outmost edge of the
curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the
curtain which coupleth the second." <span
id="fr_715"></span>[3](#fn_708.md) And the loops were coupled to fifty
taches of brass, as is said, "And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass,
and put the taches into the loops, and couple the tent together that it
may be one." <span id="fr_716"></span>[4](#fn_709.md) The length of the
curtains was thirty cubits. Take from them ten cubits for their breadth,
there will remain ten cubits from one side, and ten cubits from the
other side, as they hung down and covered the boards and the sockets.
The breadth of the curtains was forty-four cubits, as is said, "And the
breadth of one curtain four cubits; and the eleven curtains shall be all
of one measure." <span id="fr_717"></span>[5](#fn_710.md) Take from them
thirty cubits for the length of the tabernacle, and ten cubits behind
the tabernacle—these are forty. There was left there one curtain which
was doubled in front of the tent, as is said, "and thou shalt double the
sixth curtain in the forefront of the tabernacle." <span
id="fr_718"></span>[6](#fn_711.md) Rabbi Judah said, "half of it was
doubled in the forefront of the tabernacle, and half of it was hanging
behind the tabernacle," as is said, "And the remnant that remaineth of
the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth shall hang
over the backside of the tabernacle." <span
id="fr_719"></span>[7](#fn_712.md) There was also provided one great cover
of rams’ skins dyed red, its length thirty cubits, and its breadth ten
cubits; with it they clothed the tent upon the tabernacle from east to
west, as is said, "And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams’
skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers’ skins," <span
id="fr_720"></span>[8](#fn_713.md) and it was made "like patchwork." <span
id="fr_721"></span>[9](#fn_714.md) The words of Rabbi Nehemiah. Rabbi Judah
said, "there were two covers—the lower one of rams’ skins dyed red, and
the

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

upper one of badgers’ skins," as is said, "his covering and the covering
of the badgers’ skins that is above upon it." <span
id="fr_722"></span>[1](#fn_715.md)
