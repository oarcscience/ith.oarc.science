### CHAPTER VIII.

1\. The Sages stated an important rule for the Sabbatical year:—"of all
that is only fit for man's food a plaster may not be made for man, and
it is needless to say for beast. And of all that is not fit for man's
food a plaster may be made for man, but not for beast." And all that is
not fit either for man's food or beast's food, if one consider it as
food for man or food for beast, the Sages impose on it the
inconveniences of the laws relating to man and the inconveniences of the
laws relating to beast. If one, however, consider it as wood, it is
reckoned as wood; for example, the savory and the hyssop and the laurel.

2\. Produce of the Sabbatical year is given for food, for drink, and for
anointing, to eat the thing which it is usual to eat, and to anoint with
what it is usual to anoint with. One may not anoint with wine or
vinegar. But one may anoint with oil. And so is it likewise with the
heave-offering and second tithe. The laws of the Sabbatical year are
more convenient for them, because it is permitted to light a candle made
from them.

3\. Men must not sell the fruits of the Sabbatical year, neither by
measure, nor by weight, nor by count. Neither may they sell figs by
counting, nor greens by weight. The school of Shammai say, "nor in
bunches." But the school of Hillel say, "that which it is usual to make
in bunches in the house men may make in bunches in the market; for
example, cresses and the milk flower."

4\. If one said to a labourer, "here! take this aisar <span
id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_71.md) and gather greens for me to-day?" "His
hire is allowed." "Gather me for it greens to-day?" "His hire is
forbidden." If one take from the baker a cake for a pundion <span
id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_72) (saying.md), "when I will gather greens of
the field I will bring them to you?" "It is allowed." "If one take bread
from the baker in silence?" "He must not pay him from money of the
Sabbatical year, because men must not pay a debt with money of the
Sabbatical year."

5\. Men must not give money of the Sabbatical year to a well-digger, nor
to a bath-keeper, nor to a barber, nor to a skipper, but one may give it
to a well-digger for drink, and to all persons one may give a gratuitous
present.

6\. Men may not dry figs of the Sabbatical year in the usual place, but
one may dry them in a waste place. They must not tread grapes in a
wine-press, but they may tread them in a kneading-trough. And they must
not put olives into the oil-press with the stone over them, but they may
pound them and put them into a small press. Rabbi Simon said, "one may
also grind them in the house of the oil-press and put them into the
small press.

7\. Men must not boil greens of the Sabbatical year in oil of the
heave-offering, lest they take it for uses that are forbidden. R. Simon
"allowed it." And the very last thing (in a series of exchanges)
partakes of the laws of the Sabbatical year; but the fruit itself (first
exchanged) is forbidden.

8\. Men must not buy servants, ground, or an unclean beast, with money
of the Sabbatical year; but if they buy them, they must eat <span
id="fr_74"></span>[3](#fn_73.md) as much as their value. They must

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

not bring for an offering the two pigeons of one with an issue, or the
two pigeons after childbirth bought with money of the Sabbatical year.
And if they bring them, they must eat' as much as their value. They must
not anoint vessels with oil of the Sabbatical year. But if they anoint
them, they must eat I as much as their value.

9\. "A skin which one anointed with oil of the Sabbatical year?" Rabbi
Eleazar said, "it must be burned." But the Sages say, "one must
eat <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_74.md) as much as its value." The Sages
said before Rabbi Akiba it was a saying of Rabbi Eleazar, "a skin
smeared with oil of the Sabbatical year must be burned." He said to
them, "Hush! I cannot tell you what Rabbi Eleazar said about it."

10\. And again, the Sages said in his presence, it was a saying of Rabbi
Eleazar, <span id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_75.md) "he who eats the bread of
Samaritans is as one who eats swine-flesh." He said to them, "Hush! I
cannot tell you what Rabbi Eleazar said about it."

11\. "A bath which was heated with stubble or straw of the Sabbatical
year?" "It is allowed to wash in it." "But if one confer honour (on the
bath)?" "He should not wash in it."
