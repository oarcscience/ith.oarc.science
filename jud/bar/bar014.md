### CHAPTER III.

1\. He whose dead lies before him is exempted from reciting the
Shemah,—from the prayer,—and from the phylacteries. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) Those who carry the bier, and those who
relieve them, and those who relieve the relief, those who go before the
bier, and those who follow it, who are required for the bier, are
exempted from reciting the Shemah. But those not required for the bier
are bound to recite it. Both (parties) are exempted from the prayer.

2\. When they have buried the dead, and return, if they have time to
begin and end (the Shemah) before they reach the rows (of mourners),
they must begin: if not, they must not begin. Of those standing in the
rows, the inner (mourners) are exempt, but the outer ones are bound to
recite the Shemah.

3\. Women, slaves, and children, are exempt from reciting the Shemah,
and also from the phylacteries; but they are bound in the prayer, the
sign on the door-post, and the blessing after food.

4\. A man in his legal uncleanness is to meditate in his heart on the
(Shemah), but he is not to bless before, or after it. After his food he
blesses, but not before it. R. Judah says "he blesses both before and
after it."

If one stand in prayer, and recollect that he is in his uncleanness, he
is not to pause, but to shorten (the prayer). If he has gone down into
the water (to bathe), <span id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md) and can go up,
dress, and recite the Shemah before the sun shines forth, he is to go
up, dress, and recite it. But he is not to cover himself with foul
water, or with water holding matter in solution unless he has poured
clean water to it. "How far is he to keep from foul water, or
excrement?" "Four cubits."

6\. A man in his uncleanness with a running issue, a woman in her
uncleanness, during separation, and she who perceives the need of
separation, require the bath. But R. Judah "exempts them."
