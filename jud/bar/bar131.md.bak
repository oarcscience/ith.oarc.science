### CHAPTER XI.

1\. "A pan for purification which one left open, and he found it
covered?" "It is disallowed." "He left it open and found a covering on
it?" "If a weasel could drink of it, or a serpent, according to the
words of Rabban Gamaliel, or there fell in it dew by night, it is
disallowed." Water with ashes cannot be saved (from legal impurity) by
the covering <span id="fr_660"></span>[2](#fn_653.md) bound upon it. And
water in which there are no ashes, is saved by the covering bound upon
it.

2\. Every doubt implies cleanness in the heave-offering

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

and cleanness in purification. Every reason for suspense in the
heave-offering, causes pouring away of the water in purification. If
acts requiring legal cleanness be afterwards performed, they are in
suspense. Shallow water <span id="fr_661"></span>[1](#fn_654.md) is clean
for holy things, and the heave-offering and purification. R. Eleazar
said, "trickling water <span id="fr_662"></span>[2](#fn_655.md) is unclean
for purification."

3\. "A dried fig of the heave-offering which has fallen into water for
purification, and one has taken it out and eaten it?" "If it be the size
of an egg, whether it be unclean or clean, the water is unclean, and he
who ate it is guilty of death." R. José said, "if it be clean the water
is clean." He who was cleansed for the sin-offering, and afterwards put
his head and the greater part of his body into water of purification, is
unclean.

4\. Everyone charged by the words of the Law to enter water, renders
unclean holy things, and the heave-offering and ordinary things and the
tithe, and is prevented from entering the temple. "After entering (the
water) he renders unclean holy things, and disallows the
heave-offering." The words of R. Meier, but the Sages say, "he disallows
holy things and the heave-offering, but he is permitted in ordinary
things and tithes, and if he came to the temple, whether before or after
entering (water), he is a debtor (to the Law)."

5\. "Everyone charged by the words of the Scribes to enter water,
renders unclean holy things, and disallows the heave-offering, but
allows ordinary things and the tithes." The words of R. Meier, but the
Sages "disallow him in tithes." After his entering (water) he is
permitted in all these. And if he came to the temple whether before or
after entering water, he is free.

6\. Everyone charged to enter water, whether by the words of the Law or
the words of the Scribes, renders unclean the water for purification and
the ashes for purification, and the sprinkler of the water of
purification, by touching or lifting. "The hyssop, and the water without
ashes, and empty vessels cleansed for purification (render unclean), by

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

touching or lifting." The words of R. Meier, but the Sages say, "by
touching but not by lifting."

7\. All hyssop which has a distinctive name is forbidden, simple hyssop
is allowed; Grecian hyssop, coloured hyssop, Roman hyssop, desert
hyssop, are forbidden, and that of the unclean heave-offering is
forbidden, but if it were of the clean (heave-offering) one should not
sprinkle with it, but if one sprinkled with it, it is allowed. Men must
not sprinkle with the sprouts or the berries of hyssop. When sprinkled
with the sprouts, they are not prevented from entering the temple. R.
Eliezer said, "not even with the berries." These are sprouts—stalks
which have not ripened.

8\. Hyssop used for sprinkling is allowed to cleanse the leper. "If one
gathered it for wood, and fluid fell on it?" "He may dry it, and it is
allowed." "If one gathered it for food, and fluid fell on it?" "Even
though he dried it, it is disallowed." "If one gathered it for
purification?" "It is reckoned as food." The words of R. Meier. R.
Judah, and R. José, and R. Simon say, "it is reckoned as wood."

9\. The order of the hyssop (requires) three roots, and in them three
stalks. R. Judah said, "to every root three stalks." Hyssop which has
three roots is to be separated and bound, if separated and not bound, if
bound and not separated, if neither separated nor bound, it is allowed.
R. José said, "the order of the hyssop is three roots and in them three
stalks, and if there remain over from sprinkling two, and their fibres
however small, they are allowed."
