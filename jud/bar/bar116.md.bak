### CHAPTER X.

1\. The stalls cause uncleanness in two weeks and with two marks. With
thin yellow hair, and with spreading. "With thin yellow hair diminishing
in shortness." The

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

words of Rabbi Akiba. R. Johanan, the son of Nuri, said, "hair even when
long." Said R. Johanan, the son of Nuri, "what means the language, this
staff is thin, this rod is thin, thin diminishing in shortness, or thin
diminishing in length?" R. Akiba said to him, "before that you give a
proof from the rod, let us have a proof from the hair; the hair of so
and so is thin, thin diminishing in shortness, not thin diminishing when
the hairs are long."

2\. "Thin yellow hair causes uncleanness in adhesion or in dispersion,
in inclosure or when not inclosed, when it is unusual or when it is
usual." <span id="fr_607"></span>[1](#fn_601.md) The words of R. Judah. R.
Simon said, "it causes no uncleanness, save when it is unusual." R.
Simon said, "and this is the decision." "What if the hair be white?"
"White hair does not apply, because no other hair delivers from its
influence, and it causes no uncleanness, except it be unusual." "Why is
it thin yellow hair?" "Because other hair delivers from its influence."
Is it not the teaching that no uncleanness is produced except it be
unusual? R. Judah, said "every place which needs to be unusual," the law
says, "unusual." But of the scall it is said, there is not in it "yellow
hair." <span id="fr_608"></span>[2](#fn_602.md) It causes uncleanness
whether it be unusual or usual.

3\. Sprouting dark hair delivers from the effect of yellow hair, and
from the effects of spreading both in adhesion and in dispersion, in
inclosure or when it is not inclosed. "But if former hair can deliver
from the effects of yellow hair, and from the effects of spreading, in
adhesion or in dispersion, or in inclosure, and it cannot deliver if it
be grown from one side only, until it be distant from the usual standing
hair, a space of two hairs?" "If one of the hairs be yellow and one
black, one yellow and one white, they do not deliver the sufferer from
the scall."

4\. Yellow hair which preceded the scall is clean. R. Judah pronounces
it "unclean." R. Eliezer, the son of Jacob, said, "it causes no
uncleanness and it does not deliver the sufferer from the scall." R.
Simon said, "everything

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

which is not a mark of uncleanness in the scall, is in the scall a mark
of cleanness."

5\. "How is the scall shaven?" "They shave outside of it and leave two
hairs near to it, that it may be known if it spread." "Was the man
declared unclean with yellow hair, has the yellow hair gone away and
again returned, and so likewise with the spreading in the beginning, or
in the end of the first week, or in the end of the second week, after
being pronounced free?" "He is as he was before." "Was he declared
unclean with the spreading, has the spreading gone, and spreading again
returned, and so likewise with yellow hair in the end of the first week,
or in the end of the second week, after being pronounced free?" "He is
as he was before."

6\. "Suppose two scalls beside each other and a line of hair divides a
space between them?" "If the hair fall from one place he is unclean. If
from both places he is clean." "How much must be the falling of the
hair?" "The space of two hairs." "Has it fallen from one place?" "It
must be the measure of three lentils square, he is unclean."

7\. "Suppose two scalls one within the other, and a line of hair
dividing a space between them?" "If the hair have fallen from one place,
he is unclean, if it have fallen from both places, he is clean." "How
much must be the falling?" "The space of two hairs." "Has it fallen in
one place the measure of three lentils square?" "He is clean."

8\. Whosoever has a scall and within it there is yellow hair, he is
unclean. "Is black hair produced in it?" "He is clean even though the
black hair went away again." Rabbi Simon, the son of Judah, said on the
authority of Rabbi Simon, "every scall which is once pronounced clean,
there is no uncleanness in it for ever after." Rabbi Simon said, "every
yellow hair which is once pronounced clean, has no uncleanness for ever
after."

9\. "Whosoever had a scall the measure of three lentils square, and the
scall covered his whole head?" "He is clean." "The head and the beard do
not legally hinder each other." The words of R. Judah. R. Simon said,
"they do

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

legally hinder each other." Rabbi Simon said, "and the teaching is, that
if the skin of his face and the skin of his flesh have another thing,
which divides between them, they do hinder each other." The head and
beard, there is nothing that divides between them. "Is not this the
teaching that they do hinder each other?" "The head and beard do not
adhere each to the other, and they do not legally spread in leprosy each
to the other." "What is the beard?" "The hair from the division of the
cheek-bone to the covering of the windpipe."

10\. The bald head and bald forehead cause uncleanness in two weeks and
with two marks, with quickflesh and with spreading. "What is a bald
head?" "If one have eaten crocodile fat, <span
id="fr_609"></span>[1](#fn_603.md) or anointed with this fat a sore
unsuitable for the growth of hair." "What is a bald head?" "It extends
from the pate, sloping downwards behind to the covering of the neck."
"What is a bald forehead?" "It extends from the pate, sloping downwards
in front till it comes opposite the hair from above." The bald head and
bald forehead do not legally adhere <span
id="fr_610"></span>[2](#fn_604.md) each to the other, and they do not
legally spread to each other. R. Judah said, "if there be hair between
them they do not adhere to each other, but if not, they adhere."

<span id="fn_601"></span>[285:1](bar116.htm#fr_607.md) *i.e.* whether the
scall preceded the yellow hair, or vice versa.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[287:1](bar116.htm#fr_609.md) Some commentators
explain this to mean salamander oil; and others again interpret it as
sloe juice.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[287:2](bar116.htm#fr_610.md) The bald head and
bald forehead are not legally counted as one in a decision respecting a
