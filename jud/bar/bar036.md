### CHAPTER VI.

1\. "With what may a woman go out?" And "with what may she not go out?"
"A woman may not go out with laces of wool, nor with laces of flax, nor
with straps on her head, and she cannot baptize herself in them till she
unloose them; nor with frontlets, nor temple fillets, unless sewn to her
cap, nor with a headband, into the public street, nor with a golden
crown in the form of Jerusalem, nor with

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

a necklace, nor with nose-rings, nor with a ring without a seal, nor
with a needle without an eye; but, if she go out, she is not guilty of a
sin-offering."

2\. A man must not go out with hobnailed sandals, <span
id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_107.md) nor with one sandal when there is no
sore on his other foot, nor with phylacteries, nor with an amulet unless
it be of an expert, nor with a coat of mail, nor with a helmet, nor with
greaves; but, if he go out, he is not guilty of a sin-offering.

3\. "A woman must not go out with an eyed needle, nor with a signet
ring, nor with a spiral head-dress, nor with a scent-box, nor with a
bottle of musk; and if she go out she is guilty of a sin-offering." The
words of Rabbi Meier. But the Sages "absolve the scent-box and the
bottle of musk."

4\. The man must not go out with sword, nor bow, nor shield, nor sling,
nor lance; and if he go out he is guilty of a sin-offering. Rabbi
Eleazar said, "they are his ornaments." But the Sages say, "they are
only for shame, as is said, 'And they shall beat their swords into
ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift
up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.'" <span
id="fr_110"></span>[2](#fn_108.md) Garters are clean, and they may go forth
in them on Sabbath. Anklets <span id="fr_111"></span>[3](#fn_109.md)
contract uncleanness, and they must not go out in them on Sabbath.

5\. A woman may go out with plaits of hair whether they be her own, or
her companion's, or a beast's hair, with frontlets and temple fillets,
when they are sewn to her cap, with a headband or a stranger's curl into
the courtyard, with wool in her ear, and wool in her shoe, and wool
prepared for her separation, with pepper, or with a grain of salt, <span
id="fr_112"></span>[4](#fn_110.md) or with anything which she will put
inside her mouth, except that she shall not put it in for the first time
on the Sabbath, and if it fall out she must not put it back. "A false
tooth or a

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

tooth of gold?" Rabbi "allows it." But the Sages "forbid it."

6\. A woman may go out with a coin on a sore foot. Little girls may go
out with plaits and even splinters in their ears. Arab women go out
veiled, and Median women with mantillas; and so may any one, but, as the
Sages have said, "according to their custom."

7\. A mantilla may be folded over a stone, or a nut, or money, save only
that it be not expressly folded for the Sabbath.

8\. "The cripple may go out on his wooden leg." The words of Rabbi
Meier. But Rabbi José forbids it. "But if it have a place for receiving
rags?" "It is unclean." His crutches cause uncleanness by treading. But
they may go out with them on the Sabbath, and they may enter with them
into the Temple court. The chair and crutches (of a paralytic) cause
uncleanness by treading, and they must not go out with them on the
Sabbath, and they must not enter with them into the Temple court.
Stilts <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_111.md) are clean, but they must
not go out with them.

9\. The sons may go out with their (father's) girdles. And sons of kings
with little bells; and so may any one, but, as the Sages have said,
"according to their custom."

10\. "They may go out with an egg of a locust, <span
id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_112.md) and a tooth of a fox, <span
id="fr_115"></span>[3](#fn_113.md) and a nail of one crucified, as
medicine." <span id="fr_116"></span>[4](#fn_114.md) The words of Rabbi
Meier. But the Sages say (others read the words of Rabbi José and Rabbi
Meier) "it is forbidden even on a week day, because of the ways of the
Amorites." <span id="fr_117"></span>[5](#fn_115.md)
