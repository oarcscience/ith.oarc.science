### CHAPTER I.

<span class="smallcaps">Rabbi Judah</span> the Holy, said, there were
ten heave-offerings, the heave-offering of the Lord, and the
heave-offering of the tithes, of the dough, and of the first-fruits; and
the heave-offering of the Nazarite, and the heave-offering of
thanksgiving, and the heave-offering of the land, and the heave-offering
of Israelites dwelling in Midian, and the heave-offering of the shekels,
and the heave-offering of the tabernacle. The heave-offering of the
Lord, and the heave-offering of the tithes, and of the dough, and of the
first-fruits, and the heave-offering of the Nazarite, and the
heave-offering of thanksgiving, were for the priests. The heave-offering
of the land was for the priests, the levites, and the Nethinim, <span
id="fr_698"></span>[1](#fn_691.md) and the Sanctuary and Jerusalem. The
heave-offering of Midian was for Eleazar the priest, the heave-offering
of shekels was for the sockets of the tabernacle, the heave-offering

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

of the tabernacle furnished the material of the tabernacle, and the oil
for lighting, and the sweet incense, and the garments of the priests,
and the garments of the high priest. The length of the tabernacle was
thirty cubits, and its breadth was ten cubits, and its height was ten
cubits. Rabbi José said, "its length was thirty-one cubits." "How was
the tabernacle set up?" "Forty sockets of silver were placed on the
north, and forty sockets of silver on the south, and sixteen on the
west, and four on the east. These are one hundred sockets. As is
said, <span id="fr_699"></span>[1](#fn_692.md) 'An hundred sockets of the
hundred talents, a talent for a socket.'" "How were the boards set up?"
"Twenty boards were placed on the north, and twenty boards on the south,
and eight on the west. On the east there was no board, but there were
four pillars of shittim-wood. Upon them the vail was hung. As is
said, <span id="fr_700"></span>[2](#fn_693.md) 'thou shalt make a vail,'
etc., 'and thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim-wood,
overlaid with gold,' etc., and 'thou shalt hang up the vail under the
taches.'" And the sockets were made with holes, and these were cut out
in the boards below, a quarter from one side and a quarter from the
other side, and there was cut out half of it in the middle, and it made
two pins like two supports, and they entered into two sockets, as is
said, "two sockets under one board for its two tenons." <span
id="fr_701"></span>[3](#fn_694.md) The pins extended from the boards two
and two, to every one which was inserted, the positive into the
negative, as it is said, <span id="fr_702"></span>[4](#fn_695.md) "Set in
order one against the other." The words of Rabbi Nehemiah, when Rabbi
Nehemiah said, "there is no meaning in saying, 'set in order.'" "And
what is meant by set in order?" "It is meant that there should be made
for them rungs like an Egyptian ladder." There was cut out from the
board above a finger breadth from one side, and a finger breadth from
the other side, and they were put into the golden ring, that they should
not separate one from the other, as is said, "And they shall be coupled
together beneath, and they shall be coupled together above the head of
it unto one ring." <span id="fr_703"></span>[5](#fn_696.md) There is no
meaning

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

in saying, "unto one ring," and what is meant by saying, "unto one
ring?" "The place where the bar was put in, and every board had in it
two rings of gold, one above, and one below; in them were put in the
bars." And there were two upper bars, and two lower (bars) on the south
side; the length of each of them was fifteen cubits. It follows that two
were in length thirty cubits against twenty boards, and the middle (bar)
was in length thirty cubits against twenty boards, which was inserted in
the middle of the boards from east to west, as is said, "And the middle
bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end." <span
id="fr_704"></span>[1](#fn_697.md) As the boards were made in the south, so
the boards were made in the north, but in the west they were not so; but
the length of the upper bar and the lower one was six cubits against
four boards, and the middle (bar), twelve cubits against eight boards.
And the boards, and the bars, and the pillars, and the sockets, the
place of the thickness of the boards were overlaid with gold, as is
said, "And the boards thou shalt overlay with gold." <span
id="fr_705"></span>[2](#fn_698.md) "The places for the bars," there is no
meaning in saying, "places for the bars;" and what is the meaning of
saying, "places for the bars?" "The place where the bar entered the
boards." "And the bars themselves shall be overlaid with gold." <span
id="fr_706"></span>[3](#fn_699.md) "How was it done?" "Two pipes of gold
were introduced—the length of each of them was a cubit and a half; and
they were put into the hole of the board, the place where the bars were
put in."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_691"></span>[334:1](bar137.htm#fr_698.md) The Nethinim or the
"given ones" were added, it is supposed, from amongst the Gibeonites to
fill up the deficiencies in the number of Levites who returned from the
captivity in Babylon. They were held in low estimation, and were
forbidden to intermarry with Israelites.
