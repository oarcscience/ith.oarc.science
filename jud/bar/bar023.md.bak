### CHAPTER III.

1\. How long may men bring out dung to the heap?" "Till the time comes
for stopping work." The words of R. Maier. R. Judah said, "till its
fertility <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md) dry out." R. José said,
"till it hardens into a lump."

2\. "How much may men manure?" "As much as three times three heaps for
fifty cubits square of ten times ten ass panniers, each containing a
letech. <span id="fr_48"></span>[2](#fn_48.md) They may increase the
panniers, but they must not increase the heaps." Rabbi Simon said "also
the heaps."

3\. A man may make for his field three times three heaps to the fifty
cubits square. "For more than these he must excavate the earth." The
words of R. Simon. But the Sages "forbid it, till he sink the heaps
three handbreadths, or till he raise them three above the earth." A man
may keep his manure in store. Rabbi Maier "forbade it till he sink it
three handbreadths, or till he raise it three." If he have only a
little, he may increase it and proceed in his work. Rabbi Eleazar, the
son of Azariah, "forbade it till he sink the manure three handbreadths,
or raise it three, or till he place it on a rock."

4\. "He who stables his cattle in his field?" "He may make a pen twice
fifty cubits square. He may remove three sides and leave the middle one.
It follows that he has a stable four times fifty cubits square." Rabbi
Simon, the son of Gamaliel, said "eight times fifty cubits square." "If
his whole field were four times fifty square cubits?" "He should leave a
little space because of the observant eye, and

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

he may remove the manure of his cattle from the pen and put *it* into
the middle of his field, as men usually manure."

5\. A man may not open a quarry in the beginning of the Sabbatical year
in his field, unless there be already in it three heaps of stones
measuring three cubits by three cubits, and in height three cubits,
counting twenty-seven stones in each heap.

6\. A fence composed of ten stones each, of weight sufficient for two
men, may be removed. "If the fence measure ten handbreadths?" "Less than
this he may clear off; but he must leave it a handbreadth high over the
ground." These words only speak of his own field. But from his
neighbour's field he may take away what he pleases. These words speak of
the time when one did not begin the work on the eve of the Sabbatical
year? "But if one begin on the eve of the Sabbatical year?" "He may take
away what he pleases."

7\. Stones shaken by the plough, or those covered and afterwards
exposed, if there be amongst them two of a burden for two men, may be
removed. He who removes stones from his field may remove the upper
(ones), <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) but he must leave those
touching the earth. And so also from a heap of rubbish, or a heap of
stones, one may take away the upper part, but must leave that which
touches <span id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_50.md) the earth. If there be
beneath them a rock, or stubble, they may be removed.

8\. Men must not build terraces on the face of the hills on the eve of
the Sabbatical year, when the rains have ceased, because that is
preparation for the Sabbatical year. But one may build them in the
Sabbatical year, when the rains have ceased, because that is preparation
for the close of the Sabbatical year. And men must not strengthen them
with mortar, but they may make a slight wall. Every stone which they can
reach <span id="fr_51"></span>[3](#fn_51.md) with their hands and remove,
they may remove.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

9\. "Shoulder stones may come from every place, and the contractor may
bring them from every place. And these are shoulder stones, every one
which cannot be carried in one hand." The words of R. Maier. Rabbi José
said, "shoulder stones, commonly so named, all that can be carried, two,
three, upon the shoulder."

10\. He who builds a fence between his own and public property may sink
it down to the rock. "What shall he do with the dust?" "He may heap it
up on the public property, and benefit it." The words of R. Joshua. R.
Akiba said, "as we have no right to injure public property, so we have
no right to benefit it." "What shall he do with the dust?" "He may heap
it up in his own field like manure, and so also when he digs a well, or
a cistern, or a cave."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_47"></span>[66:1](bar023.htm#fr_47.md) The word translated
"fertility" means literally "sweetness." Some apply these words to the
dung out of which the moisture has "dried out," and it is then only
reckoned as earth. Others apply them to the ground which has lost its
fertility (sweetness) for want of rain (Job. xxi. 33). The meaning is
that no advantage must be gained from it in the approaching Sabbatical
year.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[66:2](bar023.htm#fr_48.md) About 36½ gallons.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[67:1](bar023.htm#fr_49.md) *i.e.* Stones lying on
the top of other stones.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[67:2](bar023.htm#fr_50.md) The removal of stones
"touching" the earth might loosen it, and become a kind of cultivation.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[67:3](bar023.htm#fr_51.md) *i.e.* From the outside
of the boundary wall, as in like manner his ears of corn might be
plucked. An answer to envious remarks that he was preparing for
cultivation (Jer. Tal.)
