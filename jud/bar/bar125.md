### CHAPTER V.

1\. He who brings earthen vessels for the ashes of the heifer must wash
them, and place them in the furnace over night. Rabbi Judah said, "even
if he bring them from his house they are allowed. Since every one is
trusted about the heifer. But in the heave-offering he opens the
furnace, and takes out the vessels." R. Simon said, "from the
second <span id="fr_641"></span>[2](#fn_634.md) row." R José said, "from
the third row."

2\. He who washes vessels for the ashes of the red heifer in water
unsuitable for purification, must dry them. If he

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

wash them in water suitable for purification, it is not necessary to dry
them. If he add therein water for purification, whether of one sort or
the other sort of water, he must dry them.

3\. A pumpkin bottle which is washed in water unsuitable for
purification, may be used for purification, till it becomes legally
unclean. When it is unclean, they may no longer purify in it. R. Joshua
said, "if one purify in it at first, one may purify in it to the last,
if it cannot purify at last, it cannot purify at first." Whether it be
clean or unclean, one must not add therein water for purification.

4\. "A hollow reed cut for the ashes of the red heifer?" R. Eliezer
said, "it must be washed at once." R. Joshua said, "it must be rendered
legally unclean, and afterwards washed." Every one is suitable for
purifying excepting a deaf person, an idiot, and a child. R. Judah
"allows a child, but disallows a woman and a neuter."

5\. Water may be prepared for purification in every vessel, even in
vessels of dung, in vessels of stone, and vessels of clay, and in a
boat. Water must not be prepared for purification in the sides of
vessels, nor in the bottom of a vase, nor in the cork of a barrel, nor
in one's fists, since they are not used for filling water, and they must
not purify with them. And the water of the ashes of the heifer is not
sprinkled without a vessel. There is no safety from defilement in the
covering <span id="fr_642"></span>[1](#fn_635.md) bound except in proper
vessels—there is no safety from the defilement of earthen vessels,
except in proper vessels.

6\. An egg-shaped vessel of the potters is allowed for the purifying
water. R. José "disallows it." "The egg (shell) of a hen?" R. Meier and
R. Judah "allow it," but the Sages "disallow it."

7\. "A trough in a rock?" "They do not fill water with it, they do not
purify in it, and they do not sprinkle from it, and it does not need the
covering bound, and it does not disallow <span
id="fr_643"></span>[2](#fn_636.md) the purifying pool." "If there were a
vessel united (to it) with lime?" "They may fill water with it,

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

they may purify in it, and sprinkle from it, and it needs a covering
bound, and (if it becomes legally unclean) it disallows the purifying
pool." "It had a hole in the bottom, and it was stuffed with a rag?"
"The water in it is disallowed, because it is not (entirely) surrounded
with the vessel." "If the hole were in the side, and it was stuffed with
a rag?" "The water within it is allowed, because it is surrounded with
the vessel." "If a rim of mud was made for it, and the water rose up to
it?" "It is disallowed." "If it was so strong that the vessel could be
lifted by it?" "It is allowed."

8\. "There are two troughs in one stone. One of them is legally
purified. The water in the second is not purified. There are holes from
one trough to the other like the pipe of a bottle, or water overflowed
from above only as much as the peeling of a garlic, and the owner had
purified one of them?" "The water in the second can also purify."

9\. "Two stones which are placed near to each other, and one made of
them a (drinking) trough, and also two kneading-[troughs](errata.htm#5.md),
and also a drinking-trough, which was divided?" "The water, which is
between them, does not purify." "If one connected them with lime or
gypsum, and they can be lifted at once?" "The water, which is between
them, can purify."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_634"></span>[307:2](bar125.htm#fr_641.md) If the vessels had
been in the first row, some one might have touched them, or some vessel
might have come in contact with them, so as to render them unclean.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[308:1](bar125.htm#fr_642.md) Numb. xix. 15.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[308:2](bar125.htm#fr_643.md) It does not disallow
the purifying pool if water flowed through a crevice in the rock into
the pool.
