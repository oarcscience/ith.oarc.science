### CHAPTER I.

1\. <span class="smallcaps">There</span> are four new years. The first
of Nisan <span id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_274.md) is a new year for kings
and for festivals. <span id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_275.md) The first of
Elul <span id="fr_280"></span>[3](#fn_276.md) is a new year for the tithing
of cattle; but R. Eleazar and R. Simeon say, "it is on the first of
Tishri. <span id="fr_281"></span>[4](#fn_277.md)" The first of Tishri is a
new year for civil years, for years of release, and for jubilees, also
for planting of trees <span id="fr_282"></span>[5](#fn_278.md) and herbs.
The first of Sebat <span id="fr_283"></span>[6](#fn_279.md) is a new year
for (the tithing of) trees according to the school of Shammai, but the
school of Hillel say, "on its fifteenth."

2\. The world is judged at four periods: at the passover, for the growth
of corn; at Pentecost, for the fruit of trees; at new year's day, when
all human beings pass before Him like lambs, as is said, "He fashioneth
their hearts alike; He considereth all their works;" <span
id="fr_284"></span>[7](#fn_280.md) and at the feast of tabernacles,
judgment is given for the rains.

3\. Messengers went forth (from Jerusalem) in six months: in Nisan for
the passover; in Ab <span id="fr_285"></span>[8](#fn_281.md) for the fast;
in Elul for the new year; in Tishri for the regulation of the feasts; in

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kislev <span
id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_282.md) for the dedication; in Adar <span
id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_283.md) for the feast of lots; and also in
Iyar <span id="fr_288"></span>[3](#fn_284.md) during the existence of the
Temple for the little passover.

4\. For two months <span id="fr_289"></span>[4](#fn_285.md) they may
profane the Sabbath, for Nisan and for Tishri, because in them the
messengers went forth to Syria, and in them they regulated the feasts.
And during the existence of the Temple they might profane it in all the
months for the regulation of the offerings.

5\. If the moon <span id="fr_290"></span>[5](#fn_286.md) appeared high and
clear, or did not appear high and clear, the witnesses may profane the
Sabbath on account of it. R. José says, "if it appeared high and clear,
they may not profane the Sabbath on account of it."

6\. It happened that more than forty pairs of witnesses were passing
through, when R. Akivah detained them in Lydda. Rabban Gamaliel sent to
him, "if thou thus detainest the people, it will be a stumbling-block in
the future."

7\. When father and son have seen the new moon, they must go (before the
Sanhedrin), not that they may be combined together, but in order that,
should the evidence of either of them be disallowed, the other may be
combined with another witness. R. Simeon says, "father, and son, and
relatives in every degree, may be allowed as competent witnesses for the
new moon." R. José says, "it happened that Tobias, the physician, his
son, and his freed slave, saw the new moon in Jerusalem, and the priests
accepted his evidence, and that of his son, but disallowed his slave;
but when they came before the Sanhedrin, they accepted him and his
slave, but disallowed his son."

8\. These witnesses are disallowed—gamblers with dice, usurers, <span
id="fr_291"></span>[6](#fn_287.md) pigeon-breeders, <span
id="fr_292"></span>[7](#fn_288.md) traders in produce of the Sabbatical

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

year, and slaves. This is the rule—all evidence that cannot be received
from a woman cannot be received from any of these.

9\. "He who has seen the new moon but cannot walk?" "They must bring him
on an ass or even in a bed." Those afraid of being waylaid may take
sticks in their hands, and if they have a long way to go, they may take
provisions. If they must be a day and a night on the road, they may
profane the Sabbath in travelling to testify for the new moon; as is
said, "These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim in
their seasons." <span id="fr_293"></span>[1](#fn_289.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_274"></span>[149:1](bar062.htm#fr_278.md) Nisan answered to
part of March and April. The reign of kings was counted from this month,
so that if a king began to reign in Adar (February and March) in the
following Nisan he would be reckoned to have reigned two years.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[149:2](bar062.htm#fr_279.md) The passover was the
first of the three feasts, beyond which one could not neglect a vow.

September.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[149:4](bar062.htm#fr_281.md) Part of September
and October.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[149:5](bar062.htm#fr_282.md) Lev. xix. 23-25.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[149:6](bar062.htm#fr_283.md) Part of January and

moon observances.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[150:5](bar062.htm#fr_290.md) The Talmud states
that when the sun and moon were first created they were of equal size.
The moon became jealous of the sun, and she was reduced in bulk. The
moon then appealed to God, and she was consoled by the promise that
Jacob, Samuel, and David were to be likewise small. As, however, some
injustice seemed to have been committed, God ordained "a sin-offering"
on every new moon, because the moon had become less than the sun!

<span id="fn_287"></span>[150:6](bar062.htm#fr_291.md) The Sanhedrin
treated gamblers and usurers as thieves.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[150:7](bar062.htm#fr_292.md) Those who bred
pigeons, to bet on their quickness of flight, or to entice their
neighbours’ pigeons to their dovecotes.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[151:1](bar062.htm#fr_293.md) Lev. xxiii. 4.
