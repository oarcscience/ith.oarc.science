# APPENDIX.

### NOTE ON MODERN JUDAISM.

<span class="smallcaps">Every</span> Jew when he attains the age of
thirteen years and one day becomes a *bar Mitzvah* (son of commandment),
and is henceforth responsible for his own sins. The ceremonies connected
with this event correspond to the Christian rite of confirmation. He is
also bound to observe the three fundamental principles of Judaism—the
wearing of the Talith, the wearing of the Phylacteries, and the
observance of the Mezuza, or the Sign upon the door-posts.

#### TALITH.

The Talith, which resembles an oblong shawl, is worn over the head or
shoulders. From its having four corners it is called arba canphoth. Its
chief name, Tsitsith, is derived from the fringes on which its holiness
depends. The Talith is made of sheep or lamb's wool, and sometimes of
camel's hair. The fringes, which are of wool, carefully shorn, must be
specially spun for this purpose. Four threads, of which one must (if
possible) be blue, are passed through eyelet holes made in the four
corners. These threads are doubled to make eight. Seven of them are of
equal length, but the eighth thread must be long enough to twist five
times round the rest, and after being tied into five tight knots, to
have an end of the same length as the others. These five knots added to
the eight threads make the number thirteen. The numerical value of the
Hebrew word Tsitsith

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

is 600, so that the sum total is 613, which represents the 613 precepts
of the oral law. These rabbinic precepts correspond to the 613 Hebrew
letters of which the decalogue is composed. They are divided into 248
positive precepts, which, the Rabbis say, equal the members of the human
body; and into 365 negative precepts which, they also say, equal the
number of the human veins. When the Talith is put on, the Jews pray,
"That it may be made through my fulfilling this precept a spiritual
garment for my soul, spirit, and breath, for my 248 spiritual members,
and for my 365 spiritual veins." Orthodox Jews also daily wear a smaller
Talith underneath their garments, and those who are more religious allow
the fringes to be seen to remind them of the 613 precepts. The Scripture
on which this observance is founded is Numb. xv. 37-39, "And the Lord
spake unto Moses, saying, speak unto the children of Israel, and bid
them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments,
throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the
border a riband (or, as the Rabbis say, a thread) of blue: And it shall
be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the
commandments of the Lord and do them." Our Lord, when on earth, wore the
Tsitsith, for the diseased woman touched "the hem" (fringe κρασπέδον) of
His garment (Matt. ix. 20), “And he rebuked the Pharisees for their
ostentation in enlarging the “borders” (fringes κράσπεδα) of their
garments (Matt. xxiii. 5).

#### PHYLACTERIES.

The second fundamental principle of Judaism is the wearing of
Phylacteries. These are supposed by some writers to be the same as the
frontlets (Tataphoth), mentioned (Ex. xiii. 16; Deut. vi. 8; xi. 18).
The Totaphoth mean properly "Ornaments," and refer to the law and
commandments, as understood in such passages as "Bind them about thy
neck; write them upon the table of thine head" (Prov. iii. 3; vi. 21;
viii. 3). And so the Karaite Jews interpret all these passages
figuratively. But since their return from the

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Babylonian
captivity, the Rabbinical Jews insist upon their literal meaning, and
they enjoin the wearing of Phylacteries (φυλακτήρια, preservatives,
Matt. xxiii. 5), upon the forehead and arm of the worshipper.
Phylacteries, called in Hebrew Tephillin (from Palal to pray) are,
*firstly*, one for the forehead (Rev. xiv. 1). It is a leathern box
which contains four compartments, in which are enclosed four portions of
the Law written on parchment, and carefully folded. This box is made of
leather, pressed upon blocks of wood specially prepared for the purpose,
while the leather is well soaked in water. When it is dry and ready for
use, the following passages of the law are sewn into it—(Ex. xiii.
1-10,11-16; Deut. vi. 4-9; xi. 13-21). On this box there is also
impressed the letter ‏ש‎ (Shin), with three strokes for the right hand
side of the wearer, and also the same letter with four strokes for the
left hand side of the wearer. *Secondly*, there is another leathern box,
without any ‏ש‎ (Shin), for the arm of the worshipper, and with only one
compartment, into which the same passages of Scripture are sewn with the
sinews of animals, specially prepared for this object. The phylacteries
are bound on the forehead and arm by long leathern straps (R’tsuoth)
which pass through the *Maabarta*, or passages in their sides. The
straps round the head must be tied in a knot shaped like the letter ‏ד‎
(Daleth). And the straps on the arm must be long enough to go round it
seven times, and three times round the middle finger, with a small
surplus over in the form of the letter ‏י‎ (Yod). There is thus formed
by the letter Shin on the phylactery, and by the knot Daleth on the back
of the head, and by the Yod on the hand the word <span
class="smallcaps">Shaddai</span>, or Almighty. This is said to fulfil
the text, "And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by
the name of the Lord (or as the Rabbis say, 'the name of the Lord is
read upon thee'), and they shall be afraid of thee" (Deut. xxviii. 10).
The time for putting on the phylacteries is during the day, at the time
of prayer and reading of the Shema, or "Hear O Israel," etc. (Deut. vi.
4, etc.) They are not to be worn at night, on the Sabbath, or on the
festival days, because it is said, "And it shall be for a sign"

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Ex. xiii. 9). As
the Sabbaths and festivals are signs in themselves, no other signs are
needed. The phylacteries are to be kept in special bags with the
greatest reverence. The Rabbis assert that they are worn by God, and
"that the single precept of the phylacteries is equal to all the
commandments."

#### MEZUZA.

The third fundamental principle of Judaism is Mezuza, or Sign upon the
door post. This precept is founded upon the command, "And thou shalt
write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates" (Deut. vi. 9;
xi. 20). The door-posts must be those of a dwelling-house; and
accordingly, Maimonides mentions ten different things which are
requisite to constitute a dwelling-house. Public buildings, such as
synagogues, are excluded from this command. The Karaite Jews reverse
this order, and affix Mezuzas to synagogues but not to private houses.
The way in which Mezuzas are made is as follows:—Two portions of
Scripture (Deut. vi. 4-9; xi. 13-21) are written on ruled vellum which
must be prepared according to Rabbinic rules. This vellum is rolled up
so as to fit into a cylindrical tube of lead or tin. The word <span
class="smallcaps">Shaddai</span> (Almighty) is written on the outside of
the roll, and a section is cut from the tube, so that <span
class="smallcaps">Shaddai</span> may be clearly seen. It is then nailed
through both its ends to the door posts of all the apartments on the
right hand side. Those who enter are thus reminded that the eye of God
is upon all their doings. Under the word <span
class="smallcaps">Shaddai</span>, some Jews write the three angelic
names, Coozu, Bemuchsaz, Coozu; and to these three angels they even pray
for success in business. When the Mezuzas are being fastened to the
door-posts the following prayer must be used, "Blessed art thou, O Lord
our God! King of the universe, who hath sanctified us with His laws, and
commanded us to fix the Mezuza."

The Talmud estimates the virtue of the Talith, the phylacteries, and the
Mezuza in the following terms:—

<span class="small">MEZUZA, OR SIGN UPON THE DOOR-POST  
PHYLACTERY FOR THE FOREHEAD  
PHYLACTERY FOR THE ARM.</span>

<span class="small">PAGE 362</span>

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> “Whoever has the
phylacteries bound to his head and arm, and the fringes thrown over his
garments, and the Mezuza fixed on his door-post, is safe from sin: for
these are excellent memorials, and the angels secure him from sin; as it
is written, “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear
Him and delivereth them” (Ps. xxxiv. 7).

If, instead of resting in the mere routine of these observances, which
they too often do, the eyes of Israel were enlightened by the Holy
Ghost, they would see them to be shadows of glorious truths. The Talith
would be seen as a symbol of the imputed righteousness of Christ, who
has fulfilled the law. The phylacteries would appear as symbols of the
necessity of having God's Word engraven both on head and heart. And the
Mezuza would be regarded as a symbol of the omniscient eye of an holy
God from whom nothing can be hidden or unknown.
