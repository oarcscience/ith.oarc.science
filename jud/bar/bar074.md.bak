### CHAPTER II.

1\. The high priest may judge, and be judged. <span
id="fr_379"></span>[5](#fn_373.md) He may bear witness, and witness may be
borne against him. He may have his shoe loosed, and the shoe may be
loosed for his wife. <span id="fr_380"></span>[6](#fn_374.md) His brother
may take his wife, but he must not take his brother's wife, because he
is prevented from marrying a

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

widow. If there happened a death in his family, he must not go
immediately behind the bier. "But when the (mourners) are concealed (in
a street), then he is discovered (to the public). They are discovered to
the public, and he is concealed in a street. And he may go with them to
the entrance gate of the city." The words of R. Meier. R. Judah said,
"he must not depart from the sanctuary;" as is said, "neither shall he
go out of the sanctuary." <span id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_375.md) And when
he comforts others, the fashion of all the people is to pass one after
the other, and the deputy priest puts him in the middle between himself
and the people. But when he is comforted by others, all the people say
to him, "we are thy atonement." And he says to them, "you shall be
blessed from heaven." And at the first meal <span
id="fr_382"></span>[2](#fn_376.md) after a funeral, all the people recline
on the ground, and he sits on a stool.

2\. The king neither judges, nor is judged. He neither bears witness,
nor is witness borne against him. He does not unloose the shoe, and the
shoe is not unloosed for his wife. He does not marry his brother's wife,
nor is his wife married by his brother. R. Judah said, "if he pleased he
may unloose the shoe, or marry his brother's wife. He is remembered in
prayer for good." The Sages said to him, "we do not hear him (the king)
(for unloosing the shoe) and his widow must not marry." R. Judah said,
"the king may marry the widow of a king, as we find with David that he
married the widow of Saul;" as is said, "And I gave thee thy master's
house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom." <span
id="fr_383"></span>[3](#fn_377.md)

3\. If there happened a death in his family, he goes not out from the
entrance of his palace. R. Judah said, "if he pleases to go after the
bier he may go, as we find in David that he went after the bier of
Abner;" as is said, "And King David himself followed the bier." <span
id="fr_384"></span>[4](#fn_378.md) The Sages said to him, "this only
happened to pacify the people." And at the first meal after a funeral,
all the people recline on the ground, and he sits on a sofa.

4\. And he may go forth to lawful warfare by order of the supreme court
of seventy-one, and he may break down a

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

road for himself, and none can prevent him. The road of a king is
without measure, and all the people plunder and lay it before him. And
he takes part first. He must not multiply wives beyond eighteen. R.
Judah said, "he may multiply wives for himself so long as they do not
turn away his heart." R. Simon said, "even if one turn away his heart,
he should not marry her." If so, wherefore is it said, "he must not
multiply for himself wives, even though they be as Abigail"? He must not
multiply horses, except sufficient for his own riding. And silver and
gold he must not multiply much, only sufficient to pay his own expenses.
And he must write a book of the law for himself. When he goes out to
war, he must bring it with him. When he returns, he must bring it with
him. If he sit in judgment it is with him. When he is seated it is
before him, as is said, "And it shall be with him, and he shall read
therein all the days of his life." <span id="fr_385"></span>[1](#fn_379.md)

5\. None may ride on his horse, and none may sit on his chair, and none
may use his sceptre, and none may see him shaving, either when he is
naked, or in the bath, as is said, "Thou shalt in any wise set him king
over thee," <span id="fr_386"></span>[2](#fn_380.md) that his dread be upon
thee.
