### CHAPTER X.

1\. All Israel have a portion in the world to come, as is said, "Thy
people also shall be all righteous," <span
id="fr_412"></span>[2](#fn_406.md) etc. And these are they who have no
portion in the world to come: he who says there is no resurrection of
the dead in the law, and that there is no revealed law from heaven, and
the Epicurean. R. Akiba said, "even he who reads in forbidden <span
id="fr_413"></span>[3](#fn_407.md) books, and he who mutters over a wound;"
and he said, "I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have
brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee." <span
id="fr_414"></span>[4](#fn_408.md) Aba Shaul said, "even to meditate the
NAME <span id="fr_415"></span>[5](#fn_409.md) in its letters."

2\. Three kings and four ordinary persons have no portion in the world
to come. Three kings, Jeroboam, Ahab, and

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Manasseh. R. Judah
said, "Manasseh had a portion in the world to come," as is said, "And
prayed unto hire, and he was entreated of him, and heard his
supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his
kingdom." <span id="fr_416"></span>[1](#fn_410.md) The Sages said to him,
"He brought him back to his kingdom, but He did not bring him back to
life in the world to come." Four ordinary persons, Balaam, and Doeg, and
Ahitophel, and Gehazi, have no portion in the world to come.

3\. The generation of the deluge has no portion in the world to come,
and they stand not in judgment, as is said, "My Spirit shall not always
strive with man." <span id="fr_417"></span>[2](#fn_411) (They have.md)
neither judgment nor spirit. The generation of the dispersion has no
portion in the world to come, as is said, "So the Lord scattered them
abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth." <span
id="fr_418"></span>[3](#fn_412.md) And the Lord scattered them in this
world, and from thence the Lord scattered them in the world to come. The
men of Sodom have no portion in the world to come, as is said, "But the
men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly," <span
id="fr_419"></span>[4](#fn_413.md) wicked in this world, and sinners in the
world to come. But they will stand in judgment. R. Nehemiah said,
"neither one nor other will stand in judgment," as is said, "Therefore
the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the
congregation of the righteous." <span id="fr_420"></span>[5](#fn_414.md)
"Therefore the wicked shall not stand in judgment;" this is the
generation of the deluge: "Nor sinners in the congregation of the
righteous;" "these are the men of Sodom." The (Sages) said to him, "they
do not stand in the congregation of the righteous, but they stand in the
congregation of the wicked." The spies have no portion in the world to
come, as is said, "Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon
the land, died by the plague before the Lord." <span
id="fr_421"></span>[6](#fn_415.md) And they died in this world. They also
died in the plague in the world to come. "The generation of the
wilderness has no portion in the world to come, and they will not stand
in judgment, as is said, 'In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and
there they shall die.'" <span id="fr_422"></span>[7](#fn_416.md) The

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

words of R. Akiba. R. Eliezer said, "of them He said, 'Gather my saints
together unto me, those that have made a covenant with me by
sacrifice.'" <span id="fr_423"></span>[1](#fn_417.md) "The congregation of
Korah will not come up, as is said, 'And the earth closed upon
them' <span id="fr_424"></span>[2](#fn_418.md) in this world. 'And they
perished from among the congregation' in the world to come." The words
of R. Akiba. R. Eliezer said, "of them he said, 'The Lord killeth and
maketh alive; he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up.'" <span
id="fr_425"></span>[3](#fn_419.md) "The ten tribes will not return, as is
said, 'And cast them into another land, as it is this day;' <span
id="fr_426"></span>[4](#fn_420.md) as the day departs and does not return,
so they depart and do not return." The words of R. Akiba. R. Eliezer
said, "as the day darkens and brightens, so will it be with the ten
tribes; as it was dark for them, so will it be bright for them."

4\. The men of a city withdrawn to idolatry have no portion in the world
to come, as is said, "*Certain* men, the children of Belial, are gone
out from among you and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their
city," <span id="fr_427"></span>[5](#fn_421.md) and they are not to be
killed till the withdrawers be from the city itself and from the tribe
itself, and till it withdraw the majority, and till the withdrawers be
men. If the withdrawers be women, or children, or the minority be
withdrawn, or the withdrawers be outside it, they are to be treated
singly, and they need two witnesses, and a warning to each one of them.
It is more grievous for individuals than for the multitude, because
individuals must be stoned, though for that reason their money is safe
for their heirs; but the multitude *are cut off* with the sword, and for
that reason their money is lost.

5\. "Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city," <span
id="fr_428"></span>[6](#fn_422.md) etc. A caravan of asses or camels
passing from place to place are delivered, as is said, "Destroying it
utterly and all that is therein," etc. From thence they said, "the
property of the righteous in it is lost, out of the city it is safe. But
that of the wicked, whether inside or outside, is lost."

6\. "And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the
street thereof." <span id="fr_429"></span>[7](#fn_423.md) If it have no
street, they must

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

make a street for it. If there be a street outside of it, they bring it
inside. "And shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil thereof,"
its spoil but not the spoil of heaven. From thence they say, the holy
things therein are to be redeemed, and the heave-offerings suffered to
decay. The second tithes and holy writings are to be concealed. "Every
whit for the Lord thy God." Said R. Simon, "The Holy One, Blessed be He,
said, If you execute judgment on the withdrawn city, I count it for you
as though you brought a burnt-offering wholly before me." "And it shall
be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again." "Thou shalt not make
of it even gardens or parks." The words of R. José, the Galilean. R.
Akiba said, "it shall not be builded again. It must not be built as it
was before, but it may be made (into) gardens and parks." "And there
shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand." <span
id="fr_430"></span>[1](bar083.htm#fn_424.md) Whilst the wicked are in the
world, wrath is in the world. When the wicked are destroyed from the
world, wrath retires from the world.
