### CHAPTER V.

1\. "With what is a beast led forth, and with what is it not led
forth?" <span id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_100) "One may lead forth the
camel with a head-stall, and the she-camel with a nose-ring, and the
Lydda <span id="fr_103"></span>[3](#fn_101) asses with a bridle, and a
horse with a halter, and all animals that wear a halter they may lead
forth with a halter, and they are held with a halter, and, if unclean,
they may sprinkle water upon them, and baptize them in their places."

2\. The ass one may lead forth with a pack-saddle when it is bound on
it. Rams go forth tied up. Ewes go forth

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

with tails bound back, doubled down, or put in a bag. The goats go forth
bound tightly. Rabbi José "forbids all, excepting ewes, to have their
tails in a bag." Rabbi Judah says "the goats go forth bound tightly to
dry up their udders, but not to guard the milk."

3\. "And with what must they not go forth?" "A camel must not go forth
with a rag bound as a mark to its tail, nor fettered, nor with fore-foot
tied doubled up, and so with the rest of all beasts; a man must not bind
camels one to another, and lead them, but he may take their ropes into
his hand, and hold them, guarding that they be not twisted." <span
id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_102)

4\. One must not bring forth an ass with a pack-saddle, when it is not
tied upon him *before the Sabbath;* nor with a bell, even though it be
muffled, nor with a ladder <span id="fr_105"></span>[2](#fn_103) on its
throat, nor with a strap on its leg; nor may cocks and hens be led forth
with twine or straps on their legs. Nor may rams be led forth with a
gocart under their tails, nor ewes with John wood. <span
id="fr_106"></span>[3](#fn_104) And the calf must not be led forth with
a muzzle, nor a cow with the skin of the hedgehog, <span
id="fr_107"></span>[4](#fn_105) nor with a strap between her horns. The
cow <span id="fr_108"></span>[5](#fn_106) of Rabbi Eleazar, the son of
Azariah, used to go out with a strap between her horns, but not with the
will of the Sages.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_100"></span>[88:2](bar035.htm#fr_102) The point to be
decided is the difference between what is necessary and what is a
burden.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[88:3](bar035.htm#fr_103) Others think "Lybian"
asses.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[89:1](bar035.htm#fr_104) Through fear of linen
and woollen being mixed. Deut. xxii. 11.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[89:2](bar035.htm#fr_105) Ladder-shaped piece
of wood to prevent it rubbing its throat if it have a sore.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[89:3](bar035.htm#fr_106) Wood discovered by
one John, which when put into sheep's nostrils, caused them to sneeze
and the maggots to fall off.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[89:4](bar035.htm#fr_107) To prevent her being
sucked by reptiles.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[89:5](bar035.htm#fr_108) The Gemara says, the
cow was his neighbour's, but as he did not object, the blame was laid on
him.
