### CHAPTER II.

"How was the tabernacle covered?" "There were provided ten curtains of
blue, of purple, and scarlet, and fine-twined linen." As is said,
"Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle (with) ten curtains of
fine-twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet." <span
id="fr_707"></span>[4](#fn_700.md) "Their threads were doubled thirty-two
times." The words of Rabbi Nehemiah, when R. Nehemiah said, “thread,"
*i.e.*, one doubled in two, "twined,"

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

[*i.e.*](errata.htm#9.md), to four, "fine-twined," *i.e.*, to eight. It
follows that their threads were doubled thirty-two times." But the Sages
say, "thread," *i.e.*, one doubled in two, "twined," *i.e.*, to three,
"fine-twined," *i.e.*, to six. It follows that their threads were
doubled twenty-four times.” They were coupled in two vails, one of five,
and one of five. <span id="fr_708"></span>[1](#fn_701.md) As is said, "the
five curtains shall be coupled together one to another: and (other) five
curtains (shall be) coupled one to another," and they were coupled with
loops of blue, as is said, <span id="fr_709"></span>[2](#fn_702.md) "And
thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the
selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt thou make in the uttermost
edge of (another) curtain, in the coupling of the second." And they were
coupled to fifty taches of gold, as is said, <span
id="fr_710"></span>[3](#fn_703.md) "And thou shalt make fifty taches of
gold, and couple the curtains together with the taches; and it shall be
one tabernacle." And the taches appeared in the tabernacle as stars in
the firmament. The length of the curtains was twenty-eight cubits, as is
said, <span id="fr_711"></span>[4](#fn_704.md) "the length of one curtain
(shall be) eight and twenty cubits." Take from them ten cubits for the
breadth of the tabernacle, there will remain nine cubits from the one
side, and nine cubits from the other side They hung down and covered the
boards till they reached the sockets. This teaches that the sockets were
one cubit high. And the breadth of the curtains was forty cubits. As is
said, <span id="fr_712"></span>[5](#fn_705.md) "and the breadth of one
curtain four cubits." Take from them thirty cubits from the east to the
west, which were on the roof of the tabernacle, and ten cubits to the
west behind the tabernacle, there are forty.
