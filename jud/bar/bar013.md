### CHAPTER II.

1\. "If one who is reading in the Law when the time comes for praying
intends it in his heart?" "He is free." "But if not?" "He is not free."
"At the end of the sections one salutes out of respect, and responds;
but in the middle of a section he salutes from fear, and responds." Such
are the words of R. Mair. R. Judah says, "in the middle he salutes from
fear, and responds out of respect; at the end he salutes out of respect,
and repeats peace to every man."

2\. The intervals of the sections are between the first blessing and the
second—between the second and "Hear, O Israel;" between "Hear" and "it
shall come to pass;" <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15) between "and it
shall come to pass" "and he said;" <span id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16)
between "and he said" and it is "true and certain." <span
id="fr_17"></span>[4](#fn_17) Said R. Judah, "between 'and he said and
it is true and certain,' none is to pause." R. Joshua, the son of
Korcha, said "Why does the (section) "Hear," etc., precede, "and it
shall come to pass"? "That one may take on himself the kingdom of
heaven, before he take on himself the yoke of the commandments." Why
does (the section) and "it shall come to pass" precede "and he said"?
"Because 'and it shall come to pass' may be practised by day and by
night; <span id="fr_18"></span>[5](#fn_18) but 'and he said,' etc., only
by day." <span id="fr_19"></span>[6](#fn_19)

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

3\. He who recites the Shemah so as not to be audible to his own ears,
is legally free. <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20) R. José says "he is
not legally free." "If he has said it without grammar and
pronunciation?" R. José says "he is legally free." R. Judah says "he is
not legally free." "If he said it irregularly?" "He is not legally
free." "In recitation he mistook?" "He must recommence from the place
where he mistook."

4\. Labourers may recite the Shemah on the top of a tree, or of a wall,
but they are not allowed to do so with the prayer. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21)

5\. A bridegroom is exempted from reciting the Shemah on the first night
of marriage, and, even until the expiration of the Sabbath if the
marriage be not complete. It happened that Rabban Gamaliel recited on
the first night. His disciples said to him, "hast thou not taught us,
our master, that a bridegroom is exempted from reciting Shemah on the
first night?" He said to them, "I will not hear you, to deprive myself
of the yoke of the kingdom of heaven even one hour."

6\. He (R. Gamaliel) bathed on the first night of his wife's death. His
disciples said to him, "hast thou not taught us, our master, that a
mourner is forbidden to bathe?" He said to them, "I am not like all
other men; I am infirm."

7\. When his slave Tabbi died, he received visits of condolence. His
disciples said to him, "hast thou not taught us, our master, that visits
of condolence are not to be received for slaves?" He said to them, "my
slave Tabbi was not like all other slaves, he was upright."

8\. The bridegroom who wishes to recite the Shemah on the first night
may recite it. R. Simeon, the son of Gamaliel, said, "not every one who
wishes to affect the pious reputation, can affect it"

<span id="fn_15"></span>[51:2](bar013.htm#fr_15) Deut. xi. 13-21.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[51:3](bar013.htm#fr_16) Num. xv. 37-41.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[51:4](bar013.htm#fr_17) Because in Jer. x. 10
it is written, "But the Lord is the true God," etc.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[51:5](bar013.htm#fr_18) Deut. xi. 19.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[51:6](bar013.htm#fr_19) Because it says, "that
ye may look upon it," *i.e.* the fringe, Num. xv. 39.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[52:1](bar013.htm#fr_20) When the expressions
"free" or "not free" are used, they refer to the decisions of the
Levitical Law. So also is it with the expressions "clean" or "unclean."

<span id="fn_21"></span>[52:2](bar013.htm#fr_21) *i.e.* the eighteen
blessings called "Amidah."
