### CHAPTER I.

1\. <span class="smallcaps">Removals</span> <span
id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_88.md) on the Sabbath are two. Of these removals
four are inside a place. And there are two other removals, of which four
are outside a place. "How?" "A beggar stands without, and the master of
the house within. The beggar reached his hand within, and gave something
into the hand of the master of the house, or took something from it and
brought it out?" "The beggar is guilty, <span
id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_89.md) and the master of the house is free." "The
master of the house reached his hand outside and gave something into the
hand of the beggar, or took something from it and brought it in?" "The
master of the house is guilty, but the beggar is free." "The beggar
reached his hand within, and the master of the house took something from
it, or gave something into it, and the beggar brought it out?" "Both are
free." "The master of the house reached his hand without, and the beggar
took something from it, or gave something into it, and the master
brought it in?" "Both are free."

2\. A man must not sit before the barber near to evening prayer, <span
id="fr_91"></span>[3](#fn_90.md) until he has prayed. He must not enter a
bath, nor a tannery, nor eat, nor judge. "But if they began?" "They need
not cease." They may cease to read the "Hear," <span
id="fr_92"></span>[4](#fn_91.md) etc., but they must not cease to pray.

3\. A tailor must not go out with his needle near dusk, <span
id="fr_93"></span>[3](#fn_90.md)

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

lest he forget and go (afterwards). Nor a scribe go out with his pen.
Nor may one search his garments. Nor shall one read at the light of the
lamp. In truth they said, "the teacher may overlook when children are
reading, but he himself shall not read." Similar to him, one with an
issue shall not eat with her who has an issue, because of the custom of
transgression.

4\. And these following are from the decisions which they mentioned of
the upper chamber of Hananiah, the son of Hezekiah, the son of Gorion,
when the Sages went up to visit him. The school of Shammai was counted,
and was more numerous than the school of Hillel. And eighteen matters
were determined on that day.

5\. The school of Shammai said, "they must not soak ink, nor paints, nor
vetches, unless they be sufficiently soaked while it is yet day." But
the school of Hillel allow it.

6\. The school of Shammai said, "they must not put bundles of flax
inside the oven, except it be sufficiently steamed while it is yet day,
nor wool into the boiler except it imbibe sufficient dye in the eye of
day." But the school of Hillel allow it. The school of Shammai said,
"they must not spread nets for beasts, nor birds, nor fishes, except
they be netted while it is yet day." But the school of Hillel allow it.

7\. The school of Shammai said, "they must not sell to a stranger, and
they must not lade his ass with him, and they must not load on him,
except they have sufficient time to reach a near place *before the
Sabbath*." But the school of Hillel allow it.

8\. The school of Shammai said, "they must not give skins to a tanner,
nor articles to a strange laundress; except they can be sufficiently
done while it is yet day." But all of them the school of Hillel allow
"with the sun."

9\. Said Rabbi Simon, the son of Gamaliel, "the house of my father used
to give white articles to a strange laundress three days before the
Sabbath." But both schools agree that "they may carry <span
id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_92.md) beams to the oil-press and logs to the
wine-press."

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

10\. "They must not fry flesh, onions, and eggs; except they be
sufficiently fried while it is yet day. They must not put bread in the
oven at dusk, nor a cake on coals, except its face be sufficiently
crusted while it is yet day." Rabbi Eliezer said, "that its under side
be sufficiently crusted."

11\. "They may hang up the passover <span
id="fr_95"></span>[1](bar032.htm#fn_93.md) offering in an oven at dusk."
And they may take a light from the wood pile in the house of
burning. <span id="fr_96"></span>[2](bar032.htm#fn_94.md) And in the
suburbs "when the fire has sufficiently lighted the greater part." Rabbi
Judah says, "from the coals however little" (kindled before the
Sabbath).
