### CHAPTER IV.

1\. Judgments in money and judgments in souls must be equally inquired
into and investigated; as is said, "Ye shall have one manner of
law." <span id="fr_389"></span>[1](#fn_383.md) "What is the difference
between judgments in money and judgments in souls?" "Judgments in money
(require) three judges, judgments in souls twenty-three. Judgments in
money open the case either for clearing or proving indebted, but
judgments of souls open the case for clearing, and the case is not
opened for condemning. Judgments in money are balanced by one judge
either for clearing or proving indebted; but judgments in souls are
balanced by one for clearing and by two for condemning. Judgments in
money may be reversed either for clearing or proving indebted; but
judgments in souls may be reversed for clearing, but must not be
reversed for condemnation. All may express an opinion on judgments in
money for clearing or proving indebted. All may express an opinion on
judgments in souls for clearing, but all must not express an opinion for
condemnation. He who has expressed an opinion on judgments in money for
proving indebted, may express an opinion for clearing, and he who has
expressed an opinion for clearing, may express an opinion for proving
indebted. He who has expressed an opinion on judgments in souls for
condemnation may express an opinion for clearing, but he who has
expressed an opinion for clearing must not reverse it to express an
opinion for condemnation. Judgments

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

in money are conducted by day and settled by night. Judgments in souls
are conducted by day and settled by day. Judgments in money are settled
on the same day, either for clearing or proving indebted. Judgments in
souls are finished on the same day for clearing, and on the day after it
for condemnation—wherefore there can be no judgments on Friday or on the
eve of a festival." <span id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_384.md)

2\. Judgments in legal uncleanness and legal cleansings begin with the
Supreme (judge). Judgments in souls begin with a judge at his side. All
are eligible to pronounce judgments in money matters, but all are not
eligible to pronounce judgments in souls—only priests, Levites, and
Israelites who can intermarry into the priesthood.

3\. The Sanhedrin was like half a round threshing-floor, in order that
the members might observe each other. And two scribes of the judges
stood before them,—one on the right and one on the left. And they wrote
the sentence of acquittal, and the sentence of condemnation. R. Judah
said, "three; one scribe wrote the sentence of acquittal, and one wrote
the sentence of condemnation; and the third wrote both the sentence of
acquittal and the sentence of condemnation."

4\. And three rows of the disciples of the wise sat before them. And
each one knew his place. When it was necessary to appoint a judge, they
appointed one from the first row. One from the second row came instead
of him into the first, and one from the third row came instead of him
into the second, and they selected another from the congregation, and
they seated him in the third row, and he did not sit in the place of his
predecessor, but he sat in a place suitable for himself.

5\. "How did the judges intimidate witnesses in the testimony for
souls?" "They introduced them, and intimidated them." "Perhaps you are
speaking from guess? or from hearsay? witness from witness? or from a
trustworthy man we heard it?" Or perhaps "you don't know that at the
last we shall proceed to inquire into your own character and

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

investigate it." "Have a knowledge that the judgments of money are not
as judgments of souls. In judgments for money, when the man pays the
money he has atoned. In judgments for souls his blood and the blood of
his posterity are suspended till the end of the world." So we find it
with Cain when he slew his brother. It is said of him, <span
id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_385.md) "the voice of thy brother's bloods
crieth." He does not say thy brother's blood, but bloods of thy brother,
his blood and the blood of his posterity. Another thing is also meant,
that thy brother's bloods are spattered on wood, and on stones.
Therefore man is created single, to teach thee that every one who
destroys one soul from Israel, to him is the verse applicable, as if he
destroys a full world. And every one who supports one soul in Israel, to
him is the verse applicable, as if he supports the full world. And it is
also said, for the peace of creation, that no man may justly say to his
companion, my father is greater than thine. And that the Epicureans
should not say, that there are more Creators in the heavens, and it is
also said, to show forth the greatness of the Holy One, blessed be He!
When man stamps many coins with one stamp, all are alike. But the King
of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He! stamped every man with the stamp
of the first Adam, and no one of them is like his companion; therefore
every one is bound to say, "for my sake was the world created." But,
perhaps, the witnesses will say "what is this trouble to us?" But is it
not already said, "And is a witness, whether he hath seen or known of
it; if he do not utter it"? <span id="fr_392"></span>[2](#fn_386.md) But
perhaps the witnesses will say, "what is it to us, to be guilty of this
man's blood?" But is it not already said, "When the wicked perish, there
is shouting"? <span id="fr_393"></span>[3](#fn_387.md)
