### CHAPTER IX.

THE CANDLESTICK which Moses made in the wilderness was wrought from
gold, and required hammering, and required knops and flowers, as is
said, "And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold; of beaten work
shall the candlestick be made: his shaft and his branches, his bowls,
his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same." <span
id="fr_770"></span>[3](#fn_762.md) "Do I hear that he shall make separate
members and join them to it?" "The teaching says, that 'they shall be of
the same.'" "Whence know we that it extends to the light?" "The teaching
says, 'Thou shalt make.'" "I am of opinion that it should be extended to
the bowls, knops, and flowers. The teaching says 'it,' and what dost
thou see to extend it to the light, and withhold it from the bowls, the
knops, and the flowers?" "Because the verse extends and withholds,
(therefore) I extend (it to) the lights that they should be made with
it, and I withhold the bowls, the knops, and the flowers, that they
should not be made with it." "Whence know we to extend (it to) the tongs
and snuff-dishes?" "The teaching says, 'thou shalt make.'" "I am of
opinion to extend (it to) the snuffers, and the tweezers." "The teaching
says, 'it,' and what dost thou see to extend (it to) the tongs and
snuff-dishes, and to withhold (it from) the snuffers?" "Because the
verse extends and withholds. I extend (it to) the tongs and
snuff-dishes, since they are used with it. And I withhold (it from) the
snuffers and tweezers, since they are not used with it." As it was made
of gold, it required hammering; when it was not of gold it did not
require hammering. When it was made of gold it

required bowls, knops, and flowers; when it was not of gold it did not
require bowls, knops, and flowers. When it was made of gold it required
a talent; when it was not of gold it did not require a talent. Rabbi
Joshua the son of Korcha said, "it (the candlestick) was made of a
talent, but the lights, and the tongs, and the snuff-dishes, were not
from the talent," as is said, "Of a talent of pure gold shall he make
it." <span id="fr_771"></span>[1](#fn_763.md) "And what do I establish?"
"That all these vessels were vessels of pure gold. But the trumpets
which Moses made in the wilderness were made of silver only, as is said,
'Make thee two trumpets of silver.'" <span
