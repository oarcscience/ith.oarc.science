### CHAPTER XIV.

When Israel was to encamp, the pillar of cloud rose up and spread out
over the children of Judah like a kind of booth, and it covered the tent
outwards, and filled the tabernacle inwards; as is said, "Then a cloud
covered the

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the
tabernacle." <span id="fr_820"></span>[1](#fn_812) And that was one of
the clouds of glory, which served the Israelites in the wilderness forty
years. One on the right hand, and one on the left, and one before them,
and one behind them. And one over them, and a cloud dwelling in their
midst (and the cloud, the SHECHINAH which was in the Tent), and the
pillar of cloud which moved before them, making low before them the high
(places), and making high before them the low (places), and killing
serpents and scorpions, and burning thorns and briers, and guiding them
in the straight way. Rabbi Simon, the son of José, said, "during the
forty years, when the Israelites were in the wilderness, none of them
had need of the light of the sun by day, nor the light of the moon by
night. When it became reddish they knew that the sun had set, and when
it became whitish they knew that the sun rose. And when one looked into
a barrel, he knew what was in it; and into a pitcher, and he knew what
was in it, by reason of the cloud, the SHECHINAH in their midst," as is
said, "For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and
fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel
throughout all their journey." <span id="fr_821"></span>[2](#fn_813) And
so it is prepared to come in the future: as is said, "Arise, shine; for
thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee." "The
sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the
moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee an
everlasting light." "Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy
moon withdraw itself; for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and
the days of thy mourning shall be ended." <span
id="fr_822"></span>[3](#fn_814) "From whence did the SHECHINAH speak
with Moses?" “Rabbi Nathan said, “from the altar of incense,” as is
said, "And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the
testimony, etc.

WHERE I WILL MEET WITH THEE." <span id="fr_823"></span>[4](#fn_815)

Rabbi Simon, the son of Yochai, said, "beside the altar of incense," as
is said, "And thou shalt beat some of it very

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

small, and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the
congregation,

WHERE I WILL MEET WITH THEE." <span id="fr_824"></span>[1](#fn_816)

The disciples of Rabbi Ishmael said, "beside the altar of
burnt-offering," as is said, "This shall be a continual burnt-offering
throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation, before the Lord,

WHERE I WILL MEET YOU." <span id="fr_825"></span>[2](#fn_817)
