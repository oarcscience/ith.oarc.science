### CHAPTER IV.

1\. "The heifer which was slaughtered without the proper intention, (the
priest) caught the blood and sprinkled it without the proper intention,
or with the proper intention, and afterwards without the proper
intention, or without the proper intention, and (afterwards) with the
proper intention?" "She is disallowed." R. Eliezer "allowed her." "And
if the priest did not wash his hands and his feet?" "She is disallowed."
R. Eliezer "allowed her." "If she was not slaughtered by the High
Priest?" "She is disallowed." R. Judah "allowed her." "If any of his
garments were wanting?" "She is disallowed." And the rites were
performed in white vestments.

2\. If the priest burned her out of her prepared place, or in two
places, or burned two in one place?" "She is disallowed." "If he
sprinkled her blood but not straight in front of the DOOR?" "She is
disallowed." "If he sprinkled her blood the sixth time for the
seventh,—he then turned and sprinkled the seventh?" "She is disallowed."
"If the priest sprinkled the seventh time for the eighth—he then turned
and sprinkled the eighth?" "She is allowed."

3\. "If the priest burned the red heifer without wood, or with every
sort of wood, even with stubble and dung?" <span
id="fr_640"></span>[1](#fn_633.md) "She is allowed." "If he skinned and cut
her?" "She is allowed." "If he slaughtered her on condition of eating
from her flesh, and drinking from her blood?" "She is allowed." Rabbi
Eliezer said, "intention does not disallow the heifer."

4\. All who are busied about the heifer from the beginning to the end
render their garments legally unclean. And any work gained from her
renders her disallowed. If any illegality happened during her slaughter,
she does not render their garments unclean. If it happened during the
sprinkling of her blood, every one busied before her disallowance
renders his garments unclean. After her disallowance he does not render
his garments unclean. It follows that her difficulty is his convenience.
They who are busied about her are always liable for a trespass-offering.
They may add wood to her during her burning. And her business is done in
the day and by a priest. Every work for gain with her causes her
disallowance, until she be reduced to ashes. And work for gain causes
disallowance in the water also, until the ashes be strewn upon it.
