### CHAPTER IV.

1\. He shook the urn and brought up two lots; one was written "for the
Name," and the other was written "for Azazel." <span
id="fr_212"></span>[1](#fn_209.md) The Sagan stood at his right hand, and
the Chief of the Fathers at his left. If "for the Name" came up in his
right hand the Sagan said to him, "My Lord High Priest, lift up thy
right hand;" and if "for the Name" came up in his left the Chief of the
Fathers said to him, "My Lord High Priest, lift up thy left hand." He
placed them upon the two goats, and said, "for the Lord is the sin
offering." R. Ismael said, "it was not necessary to mention the sin
offering" but "for the Lord." And they answered after him, "BLESSED BE
THE NAME. THE HONOUR OF HIS KINGDOM FOR EVER AND EVER."

2\. He twisted a tongue <span id="fr_213"></span>[2](#fn_210.md) of
brightness on the head of the goat to be sent away, and he placed him
opposite the gate from whence he should be sent. And the one for
slaughter he placed opposite the slaughter-house. He himself came beside
his bullock the second time, and laid his two hands upon him and made
confession, and thus he spake:—

"I beseech Thee, O Name, I have committed iniquity, I have transgressed,
I have sinned before Thee. I, and my house, and the sons of Aaron, Thy
holy people. I beseech Thee, O Name, pardon iniquities, transgressions,
and sins which I have perversely committed, and transgressed, and sinned
before Thee, I, and my house, and the sons of Aaron,

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thy holy people,
as is written in the law of Moses, Thy servant, saying, that in this day
he will atone for you to purify you from all your sins 'Before the LORD.
Ye shall be pure.'" And they answered after him, "BLESSED BE THE NAME.
THE HONOUR OF HIS KINGDOM FOR EVER AND EVER."

3\. He slaughtered him and caught his blood in a bowl, and he gave it to
him who mixed it upon the fourth platform of the Sanctuary, that it
might not congeal. He took the censer, and went up to the top of the
altar, and raked the live coals here and there, and gathered out from
the inner embers. And went down and placed it upon the fourth platform
in the court.

4\. Every day he gathered out the coals with one of silver and poured
them out into one of gold, but to-day he gathered them with one of gold
and he entered with it. Every day he gathered them out with one of four
cabs <span id="fr_214"></span>[1](#fn_211.md) and poured them into one of
three cabs. But to-day he gathered them out with one of three cabs, and
with it he entered. Rabbi Joseph said, "every day he gathered out with
one containing a seah, <span id="fr_215"></span>[2](#fn_212.md) and poured
it into one of three cabs. But to-day he gathered out with one of three
cabs, and with it he entered. Every day it was heavy, but to-day it was
light. Every day its handle was short, but to-day long. Every day it was
green gold; to-day red." The words of Rabbi Menachem. "Every day he
offered half a pound in the morning, and half a pound in the evening,
but to-day he added his handful. Every day it was fine; but to-day the
finest of the fine."

5\. Every day the priests went up the ascent (to the altar) in the east
and descended in the west. But to-day the High Priest went up in the
middle and descended in the middle. R. Judah said, "The High Priest ever
went up in the middle and descended in the middle." Every day the High
Priest sanctified his hands and his feet from the laver; but to-day from
the golden basin. R. Judah said, "The High Priest ever sanctified his
hands and his feet from the golden basin."

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

6\. "Every day there were there four rows <span
id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_213.md) of hearths; but to-day five." The words
of R. Meier. Rabbi Joseph said, "every day three; but to-day four."
Rabbi Judah said, "every day two; but to-day three."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_209"></span>[125:1](bar052.htm#fr_212.md) A. V. "Scapegoat,"
or for the "devil." Others translate "wholly put away" in reference to
the sins of the people, or for "the hard mountain," and others the
"demon of dry places." Some, however, think Azazel to be the fallen
angel mentioned in the Book of Enoch, and identical with Sammael, the
angel of death. Symmachus translates "the goat that departs." Theodotion
translates "the goat sent away." Aquila, "the goat set free." The LXX.
and Josephus understand by the term "the averter of ills," and the
Vulgate "caper emissarius."
