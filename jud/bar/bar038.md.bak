### CHAPTER VIII.

1\. One may bring out wine sufficient for the cup, <span
id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_117.md) milk sufficient for a gulp, honey
sufficient for a bruise, oil sufficient to anoint a small member, water
sufficient to moisten the eye-salve, and the rest of all beverages a
quarter of a log, and whatever can be poured out <span
id="fr_120"></span>[2](#fn_118.md) a quarter of a log. Rabbi Simeon says,
"all of them by the quarter log." And they did not mention these
measures save for those who reserve them.

2\. "Whoever brings out cord sufficient to make an ear for a tub,
bulrush sufficient to hang the sieve and the riddle?" Rabbi Judah said,
"sufficient to take from it the measure of a child's shoe; paper
sufficient to write on it the signature of the taxgatherers; erased
paper sufficient to wrap round a small bottle of balm—is guilty" (of
death).

3\. Leather sufficient for an amulet; parchment polished on both sides,
sufficient to write a sign for a door-post; vellum sufficient to write
on it a small portion, which is in phylacteries, that is, "Hear, O
Israel;" ink sufficient to write two letters; kohl <span
id="fr_121"></span>[3](#fn_119.md) sufficient to paint one eye.

4\. Bird-lime sufficient to put on the top of a perch; pitch or sulphur
to fill a hole; wax sufficient to fill the mouth of a small hole;
brick-clay sufficient to make a mouth of a crucible bellows for
goldsmiths,—Rabbi Judah says, "sufficient to make a crucible stand;"
bran sufficient to put on the mouth of a crucible blow-pipe for
goldsmiths; ointment sufficient to anoint the little finger of
girls,—Rabbi Judah says, "sufficient to make the hair grow;" Rabbi
Nehemiah says, "to freshen the temple."

5\. Red earth "as the seal of merchants,"—the words of R. Akiba; but the
Sages say, "as the seal of letters;" dung and fine sand, "sufficient to
manure a cabbage stalk,"—the words of Rabbi Akiba; but the Sages say,
"sufficient to manure a leek;" coarse sand sufficient to put on a full
lime-hod; a reed sufficient to make a pen. "But if it be

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

thick or split?" "sufficient to boil with it a hen's egg easy (to be
cooked) amongst eggs, mixed with oil and put in a pan."

6\. A bone sufficient to make a spoon,—Rabbi Judah said, "sufficient to
make the ward of a key;" glass sufficient to scrape the top of a
shuttle; a lump of earth or a stone sufficient to fling at a bird; Rabbi
Eliezer said, "sufficient to fling at a beast."

7\. "A potsherd?" "Sufficient to put between two beams,"—the words of
Rabbi Judah; Rabbi Meier says, "sufficient to take away fire with it;"
Rabbi José says, "sufficient to receive in it the fourth of a log." Said
Rabbi Meier, “Although there is no visible proof of the matter, there is
an indication of the matter, as is said, “there shall not be found in
the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth.” <span
id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_120.md) Rabbi José said to him, "thence is the
visible proof, 'or to take water out of the pit.'" <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_120.md)

*The remaining two-thirds of this treatise are not translated, as they
are devoid of interest, and in parts unfit for publication*.
