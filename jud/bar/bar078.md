### CHAPTER VI.

1\. When the judgment was finished, they brought him forth to stone
him. <span id="fr_394"></span>[1](#fn_388.md) The place of stoning was
outside the judgment hall; as is said, "Bring him forth that hath

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

cursed." <span id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_389.md) One stood at the door of
the judgment-hall with towels in his hand, and another man rode a horse
at a distance from him, but so that he might see him. If one said, "I
have something to tell for his clearing," this one waved the towels, and
the other galloped his horse, and stopped the accused. And even though
he himself said, "I have something to tell to clear myself," they
brought him back as many as four or five times, only there must be
substance in his words. If they found him clear, they freed him; but if
not, they took him forth to stone him. And a herald preceded him
(crying) "Such an one, the son of such an one, is brought out for
stoning, because he committed such a transgression, and so and so are
witnesses; let every one who knows aught for clearing him come forth and
tell it."

2\. When he was ten cubits from the place of stoning, they said to him
"confess," as it is the custom of all about to die to confess, since to
every one who confesses there is a portion in the world to come. So we
find with Achan when Joshua said to him, "My son, give, I pray thee,
glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto him." <span
id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_390.md) "And Achan answered Joshua, and said,
Indeed, I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and thus and thus
I have done." "And from whence know we that his confession made
atonement for him?" “As it is said, ‘And Joshua said, Why hast thou
troubled us? the Lord shall trouble thee this day.’ This day thou art
troubled, but thou shalt not be troubled in the world to come.’” And if
he did not know how to confess, they told him to say, "let my death be
an atonement for all my sins." Rabbi Judah said, "if he knew that he was
falsely condemned, he said, 'let my death be an atonement for all my
sins, except this one;'" the (Sages) said, "if so, every man will speak
thus to make themselves innocent."

3\. When he was four cubits from the place of stoning, they stripped off
his garments. "If a man, they covered him in front; if a woman, before
and behind." The words of Rabbi Judah. But the Sages say "a man was
stoned naked, but the woman was not stoned naked."

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

4\. The place of stoning was two men high. One of the witnesses thrust
him down on his loins. If he turned on his heart, the witness must turn
him on his loins. If he died with that thrust it was finished; but if
not, the second (witness) took the stone, and cast it upon his heart. If
he died with that blow, the stoning was finished. But if not, he was
stoned by all Israel, as is said, "The hands of the witnesses shall be
first upon him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the
people." <span id="fr_397"></span>[1](#fn_391.md) "All who were stoned were
hung up." The words of Rabbi Eliezer. But the Sages say, "none were hung
up, save the blasphemer and the idolater." "The man is to be hung with
his face toward the people, but the woman with her face toward the
wood." The words of Rabbi Eliezer. But the Sages say, "the man was hung
up, but they do not hang up a woman." Rabbi Eleazar said to them, "and
did not Simon, the son of Shatach, hang women in Askalon?" They said to
him, "he hung up eighty women (witches), and two could not be judged, in
one day." "How did they hang him?" "They sunk a beam in the ground, and
a transverse beam proceeded from it, and they bound his hands, one over
the other, and hung him up" (by them). R. José said, "the beam was
inclined against the wall, and he was hung upon it, just as the butchers
do." And they loosed him immediately afterwards. "But if he was out all
night?" "It was a transgression of a negative command, as is said, 'His
body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any
wise bury him that day (for he that is hanged is accursed of
God),'" <span id="fr_398"></span>[2](#fn_392.md) etc. As one says,
"wherefore is this one hung?" "Because he blasphemed the NAME, and it
follows that the heavenly NAME is profaned."

5\. Rabbi Meier said, "when man is sorrowful, <span
id="fr_399"></span>[3](#fn_393.md) what language does the Shekinah <span
id="fr_400"></span>[4](#fn_394.md) make him to utter?" If it be lawful so
to speak, "my head makes me ashamed, my arm makes me ashamed." If, to
speak after the manner of men,

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> OMNIPRESENCE is
sorrowful, when the blood of the wicked is poured out, how much more
sorrowful is He for the blood of the righteous. And not in the case of
the condemned alone, but every one who leaves his dead overnight, is a
transgressor of a negative command. If they left him for the sake of
honour, to bring a coffin and a shroud for him, there is no
transgression. But they did not bury him (the condemned) in the
sepulchres of his fathers. And there were two burial grounds prepared
for the Judgment Hall—one for the stoned and the burned, and one for
those beheaded and strangled.

6\. When the flesh of the condemned was consumed, they gathered his
bones and buried them in their proper place; and his relatives came and
asked after the peace of the judges, and the peace of the witnesses, as
much as to say, "know there is nothing in our hearts against you, as
your judgment was true." And they did not mourn, but were gloomy, since
gloominess is only in the heart.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[187:1](bar078.htm#fr_394.md) Before executing a
criminal, a quantity of frankincense in a cup of wine was given to him
to [stupefy](errata.htm#4.md) him and render him insensible to pain. The
compassionate ladies of Jerusalem generally provided this draught at
their own cost. This custom was in obedience to Proverbs xxxi. 6, "Give
strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that
be of heavy hearts."
