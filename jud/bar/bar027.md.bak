### CHAPTER VII.

1\. The Sages stated an important rule: "In the Sabbatical year,
everything eaten by man and eaten by beast, and a kind of dye-stuff, and
whatever cannot remain in the ground, to them the laws of the Sabbatical
year apply, and to their value the laws of the Sabbatical year apply.
They are to be cleared off from being private property, and their price
is to be cleared off from being private property." <span
id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_65.md) "And which are these?" "The leaves of the
deceitful scallion, and the leaves of mint, succory, and cresses, and
the leek, and the milk-flower." <span id="fr_67"></span>[2](#fn_66.md) "And
what is eaten by beasts?" "Thorns and thistles and a kind of dye-stuff,
sprouts of indigo and madder. To them the laws of the Sabbatical year
apply, and to their price the laws of the Sabbatical year apply. They
are to be cleared off from being private property, and their price is to
be cleared off from being private property."

2\. And again, the Sages stated another rule: "All which is not eaten by
man nor eaten by beasts, and a kind of dyestuff, and whatever remains in
the ground, to them the laws of the Sabbatical year apply, and to their
price the laws of the Sabbatical year apply, but they are not to be
cleared off from being private property, nor is their price to be
cleared off from being private property." "And which are these?" "The
root of the deceitful scallion, and the root of the mint, and scorpion
grass, <span id="fr_68"></span>[3](#fn_67.md) and the bulbs of the
milk-flower, and the spikenard, and a kind of dye-stuff, the dye-plant,
and the wormwood,—to them the laws of the Sabbatical year apply, and to
their price the laws of the Sabbatical year apply. They are not to be
cleared off from being private property, nor is their price to be
cleared off from being private property." Rabbi Maier said, "their
prices are to be cleared off from being private property till new year's
day." The Sages said to him, "if they are not

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

to be cleared off from being private property, it is immaterial about
their prices."

3\. "The peelings and flower of the pomegranate, the shells and kernels
of nuts?" "To them the laws of the Sabbatical year apply, and to their
prices the laws of the Sabbatical year apply." The dyer may dye for
himself, but he must not dye for pay, because men must not trade in
fruits of the Sabbatical year, nor in the first-born, nor in
heave-offerings, nor in carcases, nor in that which is torn, nor in
abominations, nor in creeping things. And one must not buy greens of the
field and sell them in the market. But one may gather them, and his son
may sell them on his account. He may, however, buy for himself, and he
is allowed to sell what is superfluous.

"He bought a first-born animal for a feast for his son, or for a
holiday, and has no need of it?" "He is allowed to sell it."

4\. "Hunters of wild animals—birds and fishes—who chanced to find sorts
that are unclean?" "It is allowed to sell them." R. Judah said, "if a
man become possessed of them in his ordinary way, he may buy and sell
them, excepting that such shall not be his practice." But the Sages
"disallow them."

5\. "The shoots of vines and of the locust-trees?" "To them the laws of
the Sabbatical year apply, and to their prices the laws of the
Sabbatical year apply." They are to be cleared off from being private
property, and their prices are to be cleared off from being private
property. "The shoots of the oak, and the nuts, <span
id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_68.md) and the blackberries?" "To them the laws
of the Sabbatical year apply, and to their prices the laws of the
Sabbatical year apply." They are not to be cleared off from being
private property, and their prices are not to be cleared off from being
private property. But their leaves must be cleared away to become public
property, as they fall down from their stems. <span
id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_69.md)

6\. "The rose and the carnation and the balsam and the chestnut?" "To
them the laws of the Sabbatical year apply,

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

and to their prices the laws of the Sabbatical year apply." R. Simon
said, "there is no Sabbatical year for the balsam, because it has no
fruit."

7\. "A new *Sabbatical* rose which one steeped in old oil?" "One may
pick out the rose." "But an old *rose* in new *oil?*" "One is bound to
clear it off from being private property." "New locust fruit which one
steeped in old wine, and old (fruit) in new (wine)?" "Men are bound to
clear them off from being private property." This is the rule:
everything which produces taste one is bound to clear off from being
private property, sorts that are different and sorts that are the same,
however little they be. The laws of the Sabbatical year disallow however
little of its own sort, and in different sorts that which produces
taste. <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_70.md)
