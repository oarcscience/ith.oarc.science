### CHAPTER VI.

1\. The priests began ascending the steps of the porch. They who gained
the lot for the removal of ashes from the inner altar and from the
candlestick, proceeded in front. He who gained the lot for the removal
of ashes from the inner altar, entered the Holy Place, and took the
flagon, and he bowed down and went out. He who gained the lot for the
removal of snuff from the candlestick, entered the Holy Place, and found
the two eastern lamps burning; he removed the snuff from the eastern one
and left the western one burning, and from it he lighted the candlestick
in the evening. If he found it extinguished, he removed the snuff, and

lit it from the altar of burnt-offerings. He took the cup from the
second step, and he bowed down, and went out.

2\. He who gained the lot for the censer, gathered the live coals on the
top of the altar of incense; and he smoothed them with the bottom of the
censer, and he bowed down, and went out.

3\. He who gained the lot for the incense, took the pan from the cup,
and gave it to his friend or to his neighbour, When the incense was
dispersed in it, he supplied it to him in handfuls. And he instructed
him, "be careful and do not begin too near yourself, lest you be
burned." He smoothed it and went out. The offerer could not offer the
incense, till the Captain said to him, "offer incense." If the offerer
were the high priest, the captain said, "My Lord, High Priest, offer the
incense." The people dispersed, and he offered the incense, and he bowed
down and went out from the Holy Place.
