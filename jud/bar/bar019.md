### CHAPTER VIII.

1\. These are the controversies relating to meals between the schools of
Shammai and Hillel. The school of Shammai say, "one must say the
blessing of the day, and then bless the wine;" but the school of Hillel
say, "one must say the blessing on the wine, and then bless the day."

2\. The school of Shammai say, "men must pour water on the hands, and
then mix the goblet;" but the school of Hillel say, "the goblet must be
mixed, and then water poured on the hands."

3\. The school of Shammai say, "one is to wipe his hands on the napkin,
and lay it on the table;" but the school of Hillel say, "on the
cushion."

4\. The school of Shammai bless "the light, the food, the spices, and
the distinction of the day;" but the school of Hillel bless "the light,
the spices, the food, and the distinction of the day." The school of
Shammai say, "who created the light of fire;" but the school of Hillel
say, "Creator of the lights of fire."

6\. Men must not bless light and spices of idolatrous Gentiles, nor
light and spices of corpses, nor light and spices

before an idol. They must not bless the light until they have enjoyed
the light.

7\. "If one have eaten, and forgotten, and not blessed?" The school of
Shammai say, "he must return to his place and bless." But the school of
Hillel say, "he may bless in the place where he recollects." "How long
is one obliged to bless?" "Until the food in his stomach be digested."

8\. "If wine came to the company, and there is but one goblet?" The
school of Shammai say "that one must bless the wine and then bless the
food." But the school of Hillel say "that one must bless the food and
then bless the wine. Men must answer "Amen" when an Israelite blesses;
but they must not answer "Amen" when a Samaritan blesses, until the
whole <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](bar020.htm#fn_31.md) blessing be heard.
