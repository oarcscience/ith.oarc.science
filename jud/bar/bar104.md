### CHAPTER III.

1\. The altar was thirty-two cubits square. It ascended a cubit and
receded a cubit. This was the foundation. It remains thirty cubits
square. It ascended five cubits, and receded one cubit. This is the
circumference. It remains twenty-eight cubits square. The place for the
horns was a cubit on each side. It remains twenty-six cubits square. The
place of the path for the feet of the priests was a cubit on each side.
The hearth remains twenty-four cubits square. Rabbi Josh said, "at first
it was only twenty-eight cubits square." It receded and ascended until
the hearth remained twenty cubits square; but when the children of the
captivity came up, they added to it four cubits on the north, and four
cubits on the west, like a gamma it is said; and the altar was twelve
cubits long by twelve broad, being a square. One might say it was only
"a square of twelve" <span id="fr_579"></span>[1](#fn_573.md) as is said.
Upon its four sides we learn that it measured from the middle twelve
cubits to every side. And a line of red paint girdled it in the midst to
separate the blood sprinkled above from the blood sprinkled below. And
the foundation was a perfect walk along on the north side; and all along
on the west, but it wanted in the south one cubit, and in the east one
cubit. <span id="fr_580"></span>[2](#fn_574.md)

2\. And in the south-western corner were two holes as two thin nostrils,
that the blood poured upon the western and southern foundation should
run into them; and it commingled in a canal and flowed out into the
Kidron.

3\. Below in the plaster in the same corner there was a place a cubit
square, with a marble tablet; and a ring fastened

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

in it. Through it they descended to the sewer and cleansed it. And there
was a sloping ascent <span id="fr_581"></span>[1](#fn_575.md) to the south
of the altar, thirty-two cubits long by sixteen broad. In its western
side was a closet, where they put the birds unmeet for the sin-offering.

4\. Either the stones of the sloping ascent, or the stones of the altar
were from the valley of Bethcerem. <span id="fr_582"></span>[2](#fn_576.md)
And they digged deeper than virgin soil, and brought from thence perfect
stones over which iron <span id="fr_583"></span>[3](#fn_577.md) was not
waved. For the iron defiles by touching. And a scratch defiles
everything. In any of them a scratch defiled, but the others were
lawful. And they whitewashed them twice in the year; once at the
passover, and once at the feast of Tabernacles. And the Sanctuary (was
whitewashed) once at the passover. The Rabbi said, "every Friday evening
they whitewashed them with a mop on account of the blood." They did not
plaster it with an iron trowel, "mayhap it will touch and defile." Since
iron is made to shorten the days of man, and the altar is made to
lengthen the days of man, it is not lawful, that what shortens should be
waved over what lengthens.

5\. And there were rings to the northern side of the altar, six rows of
four each: though some say four rows of six each. Upon them the priests
slaughtered the holy beasts. The slaughter-house was at the north side
of the altar. And in it were eight dwarf pillars with a beam of cedar
wood over them. And in them were fastened iron hooks—three rows to each
pillar. Upon, them they hung up (the bodies), and skinned them upon
marble tables between the pillars.

6\. The laver was between the porch and the altar, but inclined more to
the south. Between the porch and the altar were twenty two cubits, and
there were twelve steps. The height of each step was half a cubit, and
its breadth a cubit—a cubit—a cubit—a landing three cubits—a cubit—a

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

cubit and a landing three cubits. And the upper one a cubit—a cubit, and
the landing four cubits. Rabbi Jehudah said, "the upper one a cubit,—a
cubit, and the landing five cubits."

7\. The doorway of the porch was forty cubits high, and twenty broad.
Over it were five carved oak beams. The lower one extended beyond the
doorway a cubit on either side. The one over it extended a cubit on
either side. It follows that the uppermost was thirty cubits; and
between each one there was a row of stones.

8\. And stone buttresses were joined from the wall of the sanctuary to
the wall of the porch, lest it should bulge. And in the roof of the
porch were fastened golden chains, upon which the young priests climbed
up, and saw the crowns. As it is said, "And the crowns shall be to
Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen, the son of Zephaniah,
for a memorial in the temple of the Lord." <span
id="fr_584"></span>[1](#fn_578.md) And over the doorway of the sanctuary
was a golden vine supported upon the buttresses. Every one who vowed a
leaf, or a berry, or a cluster, he brought it and hung it upon it. Said
Rabbi Eleazar, the son of Zadok, "it is a fact, and there were numbered
three hundred priests to keep it bright."

<span id="fn_574"></span>[260:2](bar104.htm#fr_580.md) As this corner would
have been in the tribe of Judah, it was not added, that the whole altar
might remain in the tribe of Benjamin. Gen. xlix. 27.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[261:1](bar104.htm#fr_581.md) This sloping ascent
to the altar was strewn with salt. This salt was brought from the
mountain of Sodom at the south of the Dead Sea. The salt was intended to
keep the priests from slipping and falling, which might easily happen,
as they were obliged to minister barefooted. The coldness of the
pavement in winter, and eating so much flesh of the sacrifices, brought
various diseases on the priests.
