### CHAPTER IV.

1\. In olden times they used to say a man may gather wood, stones, and
grass in his own (field), just as he may gather that which is greater
out of his neighbour's field. When transgressors increased, a rule was
made that this one should gather from that one, and that one from this
one, without benefit; and it is unnecessary to say that one could not
promise victuals to those who gathered.

2\. A field cleared of thorns may be sown in the close of the Sabbatical
year. If it be tilled or manured by cattle, it must not be sown in the
close of the Sabbatical year. "If a field be twice ploughed?" <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md) The school of Shammai say, "its fruit must
not be eaten in the Sabbatical year." But the school of Hillel say, "it
may be eaten." The school of Shammai say, "they must not eat its fruit
on the Sabbatical year, if (the owner of it have) benefit therefrom."
But the school of Hillel say, "men may eat it whether there be

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

or be not benefit." R. Judah said, "the words are contrary; that which
is permitted by the school of Shammai is restricted by the school of
Hillel."

3\. Men may contract for cultivated fields from Gentiles on the
Sabbatical year, but not from Israelites. And they may strengthen the
hands of the Gentiles on the Sabbatical year, but not the hands of
Israelites. And in saluting Gentiles they may ask after their peace for
the sake of peace. <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md)

4\. "If one thins olive trees?" The school of Shammai say, "only cut
them down," and the school of Hillel say, "one may root them out;" but
they both agree that for smoothing the earth the trees must be cut down.
"What is meant by thinning?" "Removing one or two." "What is meant by
smoothing the earth?" "Removing three trees each by the side of the
other." "How is this understood?" "That one may root them out not only
of his own field, but also when smoothing down the field of his
neighbour."

5\. "He who cleaves olive trees must not fill in the vacuum with earth;
but he may cover it over with stones or stubble. He who cuts down trunks
of sycamore must not fill in the vacuum with earth, but he may cover it
over with stones or stubble. Men must not cut down a young sycamore in
the Sabbatical year, because that is labour." R. Judah said, "if as it
is usually done it is forbidden: but one may allow it to be ten
handbreadths high, or cut it just above the ground." "He who lops off
vine tendrils, and cuts reeds?" R. José the Galilean said, "he must
leave them an handbreadth high." Rabbi Akiba said, "he may cut them as
it is usual with an axe, or sickle, or saw, or with whatever he
pleases." "A tree that is split?" "Men may bind it round in the
Sabbatical year, not that it may cohere, but that its fissure may not
extend."

7\. "From what time may the fruits of trees in the Sabbatical year be
eaten?" "Unripe fruits, when they are becoming transparent, may be eaten
with a piece of bread in the field. When they are mellow, they may be
gathered

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

into the house; and so also with all like them." During the remainder of
the seven years their tithes must be paid.

8\. The sour grapes in which there is juice may be eaten with a piece of
bread in the field. Before they rot they may be gathered into the house,
and so also with all like them. During the remainder of the seven years
their tithes must be paid.

9\. "Olives from which men have collected the fourth of a log <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) of oil to the seah?" <span
id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55.md) "They maybe crushed and eaten in the
field." When men can collect from them half a log, they may be pounded
and used for anointing in the field. When those have been collected
which have attained a third of their size they may be pounded in the
field, and gathered into the house, and so also with all like them.
During the remainder of the seven years their tithes must be paid. But
for the rest of all fruits of trees, as are their seasons for the laws
of tithes, so are their seasons for the laws of the Sabbatical year.

10\. "From what time may men not cut trees in the Sabbatical year?" The
school of Shammai say, "every tree when it shoots forth." The school of
Hillel say, "the locust trees when they put forth their curling
tendrils, and the vines when they form berries, and the olives when they
flower. And the rest of the trees when they shoot forth." But it is
permitted to cut all trees, when they come to the season, for tithes.
"How much fruit should be in the olive tree to prevent its being cut
down?" "A quarter cab." Rabban Gamaliel said, "the whole depends on the
size."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_52"></span>[68:1](bar024.htm#fr_52.md) Twice ploughed implies
the payment of tribute when the land was under foreign rule. Its
cultivation was allowed for this purpose during the Sabbatical year. So
long as a foe could be resisted, it was not cultivated (1 Mac. vi. 49).

<span id="fn_53"></span>[69:1](bar024.htm#fr_53.md) Jer. xxix. 7.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[70:1](bar024.htm#fr_54.md) A log held the contents
of six eggshells.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[70:2](bar024.htm#fr_55.md) A seah held about the
third of a bushel.
