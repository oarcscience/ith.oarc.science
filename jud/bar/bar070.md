### CHAPTER I.

1\. <span class="smallcaps">All</span> are bound to appear in the
Temple, except the deaf, an idiot, and a child, and an eunuch, and
women, and slaves who are not free, and the lame, and the blind, and the
sick, and the aged, and the man who cannot go afoot. "What is a child?"
"Every one who cannot ride on the shoulder of his father, and go up from
Jerusalem to the Mountain of the House." The words of the school of
Shammai. But the school of Hillel say, "every one who cannot grasp his
father's hand, and go up from Jerusalem to the Mountain of the House,"
as is said, "three times." <span id="fr_353"></span>[2](#fn_348.md)

2\. The school of Shammai say, "the appearance in the Temple is with two
pieces of silver, and the peace-offering with a meah of silver." <span
id="fr_354"></span>[3](#fn_349.md) But the school of Hillel say, "the
appearance is with a meah of silver, and the feast offering with two
pieces of silver."

3\. The burnt offerings of the appointed feasts come from ordinary
money; but the peace-offering from tithes. "The offerings on the first
holiday of the passover?" <span id="fr_355"></span>[4](#fn_350.md) The
school of Shammai say, "from ordinary money," but the school of Hillel
say, "from tithes."

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

4\. Israelites discharge their duty with vows, with freewill offerings,
and with tithes of animals; and priests with sin-offerings, with
trespass-offerings, and with the breast and shoulder, and first-born,
but not with fowls, nor with meat-offerings.

5\. "If one have a large family and small income?" "He must bring more
peace-offerings, and less burnt-offerings." "If a small family and large
income?" "He must bring more burnt-offerings, and less peace-offerings."
"If both be small?" "Of this they say, a silver meah, and two pieces of
silver are sufficient." "If both be large?" "Of this it is said, every
man shall give as he is able according to the blessing of the Lord thy
God which He hath given thee." <span id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_351.md)

6\. When one did not bring his peace-offering on the first holiday of
the feast, he may bring it during the holidays, and even on the last day
of the feast. "If the feast passed over, and he did not bring the
peace-offering?" "He is not obliged to bring it." For this it is said,
"that which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is
wanting cannot be numbered." <span id="fr_357"></span>[2](#fn_352.md)

7\. Rabbi Simon the son of Menasia said, "if thou shalt say, a thief or
a robber, he may return and become straight." R. Simon the son of Jochai
said, "we do not call one crooked, save one straight at first, and he
became afterwards crooked; and this is the disciple of the wise, who
departs from the Law."

8\. The remission of vows is like flying in the air, and it has no
foundation. The decisions for the Sabbath, peace-offerings, and
trespasses, are as mountains hanging on a hair; because the verse is
small but the decisions are many. Jurisprudence, and the Temple service,
cleanness and uncleanness, and illegal connections, have their own
foundations; they, they are the body of the law.

(chagiga) was the offering of individual worshippers, and was quite
distinct from the sacrifices of the whole congregation. See Treatise on
the Passover, vi. 4 (*note*).
