### CHAPTER I.

1\. <span class="smallcaps">Seven</span> days before the Day of
Atonement the High Priest was removed from his house to the
chamber <span id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_188.md) Parhedrin, and the council
prepared for him another priest, <span id="fr_192"></span>[2](#fn_189.md)
lest there happen to him any defilement. R. Judah said, "they prepared
also another wife, lest his wife die;" as is said, <span
id="fr_193"></span>[3](#fn_190.md) "And he shall atone for himself and for
his house;" for his house, *i.e.* for his wife. The Sages said to him,
"if so, there is no end to the matter."

2\. All these seven days, he (the high priest) sprinkled the blood,
burned the incense, and trimmed the lamps, and offered the head and the
foot. On the remainder of all the days, if he wished to offer, he
offered; since the high priest first offered part, and first took part
(in the sacrifices).

3\. The elders from the elders of the great Sanhedrin delivered to him,
and read before him, the ceremonial of the day; and they said to him,
"My Lord High Priest, read with thy mouth, perchance thou hast
forgotten, or perchance thou hast not learned." <span
id="fr_194"></span>[4](#fn_191.md) On the eve of the day of atonement,
towards dawn, they placed him in the eastern gate (of the Temple), and
they caused to pass before him bullocks,

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

rams, and lambs, that he might be skilled and expert in his ministry.

4\. All the seven days they did not withhold from him food and drink;
the eve of the day of atonement, with the beginning of darkness, they
did not permit him to eat much, since food induces sleep.

5\. The elders of the great Sanhedrin delivered him to the elders of the
priesthood, who brought him to the upper chamber of the house Abtinas.
And they administered to him the oath, <span
id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_192.md) and they left him and departed. And
they. said to him, "My Lord High Priest, we are ambassadors of the great
Sanhedrin, and thou art our ambassador, and the ambassador of the great
Sanhedrin. We adjure thee by Him, whose Name dwells in this house, that
thou wilt not change aught of all which we have said to thee." He went
apart and wept. They went apart and wept. <span
id="fr_196"></span>[2](#fn_193.md)

6\. If he were a learned man, he expounded; but if not, the disciples of
the learned expounded before him. If he were skilled in reading, he
read; but if not, they read before him. "And in what did they read
before him?" "In Job, and in Ezra, and in Chronicles." Zachariah, the
son of Kebutal, said, "I often read before him in Daniel."

7\. If he desired to sleep, the young priests filliped with the first
finger <span id="fr_197"></span>[3](#fn_194.md) before him, and said to
him, "My Lord High Priest, stand up and refresh thyself <span
id="fr_198"></span>[4](#fn_195.md) once on the pavement," and they kept him
occupied <span id="fr_199"></span>[5](#fn_196.md) until the time approached
for slaying (the victims).

8\. Every day they cleansed the altar at cockcrow, or at its approach,
intermediate before or after it; and on the day of atonement <span
id="fr_200"></span>[6](#fn_197.md) at midnight; and in the three great
feasts, at the first watch. And before cockcrow the court was crowded
with Israel.

incense "within" the vail (Lev. xvi. 12, 13), in opposition to the
Sadducees, who maintained that the incense should be burned "without."

<span id="fn_193"></span>[120:2](bar049.htm#fr_196.md) That such an oath
was necessary.

etc." (Psalm cxxvii.)

<span id="fn_197"></span>[120:6](bar049.htm#fr_200.md) The Jews think that
the day of atonement was the day on which Adam sinned, on which Abraham
was circumcised, and on which Moses offered atonement for the sin of the
golden calf.
