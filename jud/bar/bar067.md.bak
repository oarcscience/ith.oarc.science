### CHAPTER II.

1\. "What is the order of the fast-days?" "Men draw out the ark
containing the rolls of the Law to the public street of the city, and
they put burnt ashes on the top of the ark, and on the head of the
prince, and on the head of the president of the tribunal, and every one
takes and puts ashes on his own head." The most aged of them says before
them touching words, "Brethren, it is not said for the men of Nineveh,
'And God saw their sackcloth and their fasting,' <span
id="fr_322"></span>[1](#fn_318.md) but 'God saw their works, that they
returned from their evil way.' And in the tradition (of the prophet) he
says <span id="fr_323"></span>[2](#fn_319.md) 'Rend your hearts and not
your garments, and turn unto the Lord your God.'"

2\. When they stood in prayer, they placed before the ark an aged man
and full of experience, one who had children and an unblemished house,
that his heart be not distracted in prayer, and he says before them
twenty-four blessings, the usual eighteen for every day, and he adds to
them six more.

3 These are they, "remembrances," <span id="fr_324"></span>[3](#fn_320.md)
and "blowing of the trumpets," <span id="fr_325"></span>[3](#fn_320.md) "In
my distress I cried unto the Lord, and He heard me," <span
id="fr_326"></span>[4](#fn_321.md) "I will lift up my eyes unto the
hills," <span id="fr_327"></span>[5](#fn_322.md) "out of the depths have I
cried unto Thee, O Lord," <span id="fr_328"></span>[6](#fn_323.md) "A
prayer of the afflicted when he is overwhelmed." <span
id="fr_329"></span>[7](#fn_324.md) Rabbi Judah says, "it was not necessary
to say the 'remembrances,' and 'the trumpets,' but he said instead of
them, 'If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,'" <span
id="fr_330"></span>[8](#fn_325.md) etc. "The word of the Lord that came to
Jeremiah concerning the dearth." <span id="fr_331"></span>[9](#fn_326.md)
And he said their closing benediction.

4\. For the first additional prayer he said, "He who answered Abraham
our father on Mount Moriah, He shall answer you, and hear the voice of
your cry this day. Blessed be Thou, Lord, the Redeemer of Israel." For
the second he said, "He who answered our fathers by the Red

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

sea, He will answer you, and hear the voice of your cry this day.
Blessed be Thou, Lord, who rememberest those forgotten by man." For the
third he said, "He who answered Joshua in Gilgal, He will answer you,
and hear the voice of your cry this day. Blessed be Thou, Lord, who
hearest the blowing of the trumpet." For the fourth he said, "He who
answered Samuel in Mizpah, He will answer you, and hear the voice of
your cry this day. Blessed be Thou, Lord, who hearest the cry of
distress." For the fifth he said, "He who answered Elijah on Mount
Carmel, He will answer you, and hear the voice of your cry this day.
Blessed be Thou, Lord, who hearest prayer." For the sixth he said, "He
who answered Jonah from the fish's belly, He will answer you, and hear
the voice of your cry this day. Blessed be Thou, Lord, who art ever
answering prayer in the time of need." For the seventh he said, "He who
answered David and Solomon his son in Jerusalem, He will answer you, and
will hear the voice of your cry this day. Blessed be Thou, Lord, who
hast pity on the earth."

5\. It happened in the days of Rabbi Chelpatha and R. Chanania, son of
Teradion, that a minister passed before the ark, and finished the whole
blessing, and the congregation did not answer after him, Amen. One cried
out, "Let the priests blow the trumpets;" they blew. (The minister
prayed), "May He who answered Abraham our Father on Mount Moriah answer
you, and hear the voice of your cry this day." (One cried out), "Let the
sons of Aaron blow an alarm;" they blew an alarm. (The minister prayed),
"May He who answered our fathers by the Red Sea, answer you, and hear
the voice of your cry this day." And when the matter came before the
Sages they said it was not customary to do so, save in the Eastern gate
and on the Mountain of the House.

6\. These are the first three fasts. The priests of the weekly Watch of
the Temple fasted, but not completely. And the priests of their
"Father's House" <span id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_327.md) did not fast at
all.

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In the second
three fasts the men of the Watch fasted completely. And the men of their
"Father's House" fasted, but not completely. "In the seven last fasts
both of them fasted completely." The words of Rabbi Joshua. But the
Sages say, "in the three first fasts neither one nor other fasted at
all. In the second three fasts the priests of the Watch fasted, but not
completely. And the priests of their 'Father's House' did not fast at
all. In the seven last fasts the priests of the Watch fasted completely,
and the priests of their Father's House' fasted, but not completely."

7\. The men of the Watch are allowed to drink wine by night, but not by
day, and the men who inherit the patrimony of their fathers <span
id="fr_333"></span>[1](#fn_328.md) may not drink it neither by day nor
night. The men of the Watch and the Delegates <span
id="fr_334"></span>[2](#fn_329.md) are not allowed to shave, nor wash,
except on Thursdays for the honour of the approaching Sabbath.

8\. That which is written in "The Roll of Fasting," <span
id="fr_335"></span>[3](#fn_330.md) "not to mourn" on certain days—the day
before them it is not allowed—the day after them it is allowed to mourn.
Rabbi José said, "both before and after the day it is not allowed." But
when it is written, "not to fast," both the day before and the day after
the fast, it is allowed to fast. Rabbi José said, "before the fast it is
not allowed—after the fast it is allowed."

9\. The rulers must not proclaim fasts for the congregation to begin on
Thursday, so as not to raise the market. But the three first fasts are
Monday, Thursday, and Monday. And the three second, Thursday, Monday,
and Thursday. Rabbi José said, "as the first fasts are not to begin on
Thursday, so likewise the second and the last are not to begin on that
day."

10\. "The rulers must not proclaim fasting for the congregation on the
feast of New Moon, and on the feasts of Dedication,

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

and Purim; but if they have already begun, they need not cease." The
words of Rabbi Gamaliel. Said R. Meier, "even though Rabbi Gamaliel said
they need not cease, he admits that the congregation do not fast the
whole day; and so also on the ninth of Ab, the fast for the burning of
the temple, if it happen on the eve of the Sabbath."

priests ministering in their course, others explain this expression by
Deut. xviii. 8. The priests were divided into twenty-four <span

the Temple. These Watches were again subdivided into seven "Father's
Houses," and each "Father's House" officiated for a day in the Temple. A
dispensation from fasting was granted to the priests on duty, that they
might not be weak hi the service of the Sanctuary.

written in Chaldee, as is proved by the quotations from it.
