### CHAPTER V.

1\. The Captain of the Watch said, "give one blessing," and the priests
blessed and read the ten commandments, "Hear," <span
id="fr_551"></span>[2](#fn_545.md) etc. "And it shall come to pass if ye
shall hearken," <span id="fr_552"></span>[3](#fn_546.md) etc. And "He
spake," <span id="fr_553"></span>[4](#fn_547.md) etc. They then gave the
three blessings to the people, "Truth and Sureness," and "the Service,"
and "the Blessing of the Priests." And on the Sabbath they added one
blessing for the outgoing Temple-guard.

2\. He said to them, "novices <span id="fr_554"></span>[5](#fn_548.md) to
the incense, come and cast lots." They cast lots. He gained who gained.
He said to them, "novices with old men come and cast lots, who shall
bring up the members of the lamb from the ascent to the altar." R.
Eliezar, the son of Jacob, said, "those priests who brought the members
to the ascent must also bring them to the top of the altar."

3\. He handed the priests over to the sextons. They divested them of
their dresses, leaving them their breeches only, and there were windows
there, and over them was written, "used for vestments." <span
id="fr_555"></span>[6](#fn_549.md)

4\. He who gained the lot for the incense, took the spoon; and the spoon
resembled a great measure of gold containing three cabs. And the pan was
heaped full of incense; and it had a covering like a kind of weight upon
it.

5\. He who gained the lot for the censer, took the silver censer, and
went up to the top of the altar, and he turned the live coals here and
there, and he put them into the censer. He descended, and poured them
into a censer of

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

gold. There was dispersed from them about a cab of live coals, and he
brushed them into the channel for refuse. On the Sabbath he put over
them a cover. And the cover was a great vessel containing a
letech. <span id="fr_556"></span>[1](#fn_550.md) And there were two chains
to it, one by which the priest drew it down, and one by which he held it
from above, that it should not be rolled about; and it was useful for
three purposes, as a covering over the live coals, and as a covering
over the reptile on the Sabbath, and it was also used to carry down the
ashes from the altar.

6\. The priests arrived between the porch and the altar. One of them
took the shovel, <span id="fr_557"></span>[2](#fn_551.md) and flung it
between the porch and the altar. No one could hear the voice of his
neighbour in Jerusalem from the rattling of the shovel. And it was
useful for three purposes: when the priest heard its rattle, he knew
that his brother priests were entering to worship, and he came running;
and the Levite, when he heard its rattle, knew that his brother Levites
were entering to chant, and he came running; and the chief of the
Delegates <span id="fr_558"></span>[3](#fn_552.md) compelled the defiled
men to stand in the eastern gate of the Temple.
