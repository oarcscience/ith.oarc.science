<p>1. "Whosoever puts his hands into a house smitten with leprosy?" "His hands are unclean in a primary degree."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_672"></A><A HREF="#fn_665"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The words of R. Akibah. But the Sages say, "his hands are unclean in a secondary degree."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_673"></A><A HREF="#fn_666"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> "Whatever renders garments unclean at the time of contact, renders hands unclean in a primary degree." The words of R. Akibah. But the Sages say, "in a secondary degree." They said to R. Akibah, "where do we find the hands (unclean) in a primary degree?" "Everywhere," he said to them; "and how is it possible for them to be unclean in a primary degree, unless his body is unclean, excepting this."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_674"></A><A HREF="#fn_667"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> "Victuals, and vessels which are unclean through liquids render hands unclean in a secondary degree." The words of R. Joshua. But the Sages say, "that which is unclean through a source of uncleanness,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_675"></A><A HREF="#fn_668"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> renders the hands unclean; but derived uncleanness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_676"></A><A HREF="#fn_669"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> does not render the hands unclean." Rabban Simeon, the son of Gamaliel, said, "it happened that a woman came before my father. She said to him, 'my hands entered into the hollow of an earthen vessel.' He said to her 'my daughter, from what was its uncleanness?' But I did not hear what she said to him." The Sages said, "the thing is clear, that which is unclean through a source of uncleanness renders the hands unclean; but derived uncleanness does not render the hands unclean."</p>  
<p>2. "Whatever disallows the heave-offering, renders the</p>

<p>hands unclean in a secondary degree. One hand can render the other hand unclean." The words of R. Joshua. But the Sages say, "a secondary cannot make a secondary."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_677"></A><A HREF="#fn_670"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> He said to them, "and are not Holy Scriptures secondaries, and they render the hands unclean." They said to him, "we cannot judge the words of the Law from the words of the scribes, nor the words of the scribes from the words of the Law, nor the words of the scribes from other words of the scribes."</p>  
<p>3. Straps of phylacteries with the phylacteries, render the hands unclean. R. Simeon says, "the straps of phylacteries do not render the hands unclean."</p>  
<p>4. The margin in a book of the Law, at the top and bottom, at the beginning and end, renders the hands unclean. R. Jos&eacute; says, "in the end it does not render the hands unclean, until the roller be attached."</p>  
<p>5. A book of the Law which is erased, but in which there remain eighty-five letters like the portion, "And it came to pass when the Ark set forward,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_678"></A><A HREF="#fn_671"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> renders the hands unclean. Any roll in which there are written eighty-five letters like the portion, "And it came to pass when the Ark set forward," renders the hands unclean. All sacred Scriptures render the hands unclean. The Canticles and Ecclesiastes render the hands unclean. R. Judah says, "Canticles render the hands unclean, but Ecclesiastes is in dispute." R. Jos&eacute; says, "Ecclesiastes does not render the hands unclean, but the Canticles are in dispute." R. Simeon says, "Ecclesiastes is one in which the school of Shammai is less strict, and the school of Hillel more rigid." R. Simeon, the son of Azai, said, "I received by tradition from the mouths of the seventy-two elders, on the day they inducted R. Eleazar, the son of Azariah, into the presidents&#146; seat, that Canticles and Ecclesiastes render the hands unclean." R. Akivah said, "God forbid! no man in Israel ever questioned that the Canticles render the hands unclean, as the whole world is not equal to</p>

<p>the day on which the Canticles were given to Israel; for all the Scriptures are holy, but the Canticles are Holy of Holies. They only disputed in reference to Ecclesiastes." R. Jochanan, the son of Joshua, the son of R. Akibah's father-in-law, said, "according to the words of the son of Azai, thus they disputed, and thus they decided."</p>
