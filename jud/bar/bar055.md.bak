### CHAPTER VII.

1\. The High Priest came to read. If he wished to read in linen
garments, he read. If not, he read in his own white stole. The public
Minister of the congregation took out the roll of the Law, and delivered
it to the Chief of the congregation, and the Chief of the congregation
gave it to the Sagan, and the Sagan gave it to the High Priest. And the
High Priest stood and received it and read. He stood and read "after the
death" <span id="fr_236"></span>[2](#fn_232.md) and "also on the tenth
day." <span id="fr_237"></span>[3](#fn_233.md) And he rolled up the book of
the Law, and put it into his bosom, and said, "More than what I have
read before you is written here." And "on the tenth" <span
id="fr_238"></span>[4](#fn_234.md) in the Pentateuch of overseers he
recited, and pronounced upon it eight blessings; upon the Law, and upon
the Service, and upon the confession, and upon the forgiveness of sins,
and upon the Sanctuary separately, and upon Israel separately, and upon
Jerusalem separately, and upon the Priests separately, and upon the
remainder of the prayer.

2\. He who saw the High Priest, when he read, could not see the bullock
and the he-goat, when they were burning. And he who saw the bullock and
the he-goat, when they were burning, could not see the High Priest, when
he read. Not because it was forbidden, but because the way was far, and
the work of both was proceeding at once.

3\. If he read in linen garments, he sanctified his hands and his feet,
he undressed, he descended and bathed. He came up, and wiped himself.
They brought him golden garments, and he dressed, and he sanctified his
hands and his feet, and went forth and offered the ram for himself, and
the ram for the people, and seven lambs without blemish of a year old.
The words of R. Eleazar. R. Akiba said, "with

the morning sacrifice they were offered." And the bullock of burnt
offering and the he-goat, <span id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_235.md) which
was prepared without, were offered with the evening sacrifice.

4\. He purified his hands and his feet, and undressed, and washed, and
he came up, and wiped himself. They brought to him white garments, and
he dressed, and sanctified his hands and his feet. He entered to bring
forth the spoon and the censer, he sanctified his hands and his feet,
and undressed, and he descended, and washed. He came up, and wiped
himself. They brought to him garments of gold, and he dressed, and
sanctified his hands and his feet. And he entered to offer the evening
incense, and to trim the lights; and he sanctified his hands and his
feet, and he dressed. They brought to him his own garments, and he
dressed. And they escorted him to his house. And he made a feast-day for
his friends, when he went out in peace from the Sanctuary.

5\. The High Priest ministered in eight vestments. And the ordinary
priest in four, in the tunic, and drawers, and bonnet, and girdle. To
these, the High Priest added the breastplate, and ephod, and robe, and
(golden) plate. In these they inquired by Urim and Thummim. <span
id="fr_240"></span>[2](#fn_236.md) And they did not inquire in them for a
private person; only for the King and the great Sanhedrin, and for
whomsoever the congregation is necessary.
