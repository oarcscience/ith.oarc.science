### CHAPTER IV.

1\. The priests did not tie the four feet of the lamb together, but they
bound its fore and hind feet. He who gained the lot for carrying the
members, held it; and thus was it bound, its head southward, and its
face westward. The slaughterer stood in the east with his face westward.
The morning sacrifice was slaughtered at the north-western

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

corner on the second ring. The evening sacrifice was slaughtered at the
north-eastern corner on the second ring. The slaughterer slaughtered,
and the receiver caught (the blood). The priest came to the
north-eastern corner of the altar, and he sprinkled the blood
north-east. He came to the south-west, and sprinkled the blood
south-west: <span id="fr_549"></span>[1](#fn_543.md) the remainder of the
blood he poured out on the southern altar-base.

2\. The priest did not break its leg, but he made a hole in the midst of
its side, and by that it was hung up. He skinned it downward till he
came to the breast. When he came to the breast, he cut off the head, and
gave it to him who had gained (its lot). He cut off the two hind feet,
and gave them to him who had gained them for his lot. He finished the
skinning; he tore out the heart, that the blood should come out. He cut
off the two fore feet, and gave them to him who had gained them for his
lot. He came to the right leg; he cut it off, and gave it to him who had
gained it for his lot. He cleft the body, and it became all open before
him. He took out the caul, and put it on the place of slaughter, with
the head on the top of it. He took out the intestines and gave them to
him who had gained them for his lot to cleanse them. And the belly they
cleansed in the house of the washers, as much as was needful. And the
intestines were cleansed three times at least, upon the marble tables
between the pillars.

3\. The priest took the knife and separated the lungs from the liver,
and the finger of the liver from the liver, but he did not remove it
from its place. He made a hole in the breast, and gave it to him who
gained it for his lot. He came to the right side, and he cut it
downwards to the backbone, but he did not touch the backbone, till he
came to the two tender ribs. He cut it off and gave it to him who gained
it for his lot, with the liver hanging upon it.

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He came to the
neck, and left the two side bones on both sides. He cut it off and gave
it to him who had gained it for his lot, with the windpipe and the heart
and the lungs hanging upon it. He came to the left side, and left on it
the two tender ribs, above and below, and so he left it on the
corresponding side. It follows that he left on the two sides, two and
two ribs above, and two and two ribs below. He cut it off, and gave it
to him who gained it for his lot, the backbone with it, and the spleen
hanging upon it. And it was large, but the right side is called large,
as the liver hangs upon it. He came to the tail; he cut it off and gave
it to him who gained it for his lot, and the fat, and the finger of the
liver, and the two kidneys with it. He took the left hind leg, and gave
it to him who gained it for his lot. It follows that all the priests
stood in one row with the members in their hands. The first priest with
the head and hind foot, the head in his right hand with the nose towards
his arm, and the horns between his fingers, and the place of slaughter
upwards, and the caul placed on it; and the right hind foot in his left
hand with the skin outside. The second priest stood with the two fore
legs, the right in his right hand, and the left in his left hand, and
the skin outside. The third priest stood with the tail and the hind
foot; the tail in his right hand, and the fat wrapped between his
fingers, and the finger of the liver and the two kidneys with it; the
left foot was in his left hand with the skin outwards. The fourth priest
stood with the breast and the throat. The breast was in his right hand,
and the throat in his left, and its side bones between his fingers. The
fifth priest stood with the two sides, the right side in his right hand,
and the left side in his left hand, and the skinny side outwards. The
sixth priest stood with the intestines placed in a pan, and the legs
over them. The seventh priest stood with the fine flour. The eighth
priest stood with the pancakes. The ninth priest stood with the wine.
They then proceeded and deposited the members on the lower half of the
ascent westward, and they salted them, and descended,

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

and came to the chamber of the hewn stone to read the "Hear," <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_543"></span>[248:1](bar098.htm#fr_549.md) In each act of
sprinkling the priest, standing before a corner, sprinkled the blood on
two sides of the altar. And thus, in two acts of sprinkling, he put the
blood on its four sides.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[250:1](bar098.htm#fr_550.md) Called the Shema. It
consisted of the following three passages of Scripture:—Deut. vi. 4-9,
Deut. xi. 13-21, Numb. xv. 37-41.
