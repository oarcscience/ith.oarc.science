### CHAPTER II.

"If the white spot looked dim in a German, and the dim white in an
Æthiopian?" Rabbi Ishmael said, "for the

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

children of Israel I am atoning, they are as boxwood neither black nor
white, but intermediate." R. Akiba said, "painters have colours, by
which they paint faces black and white and intermediate. One introduces
a medium colour, and encircles it outside, and the face appears
intermediate." R. Judah said, "the indications of leprosy are for
convenience, but not for inconvenience; the German is to be inspected in
his flesh for convenience, and the Æthiopian as intermediate for
convenience." But the Sages say, "both are intermediate."

2\. Lepers are not to be inspected in the early morning nor in the <span
id="fr_598"></span>[1](#fn_592.md) evening; nor inside a house, nor on a
cloudy day, lest the dim appear white, nor at noon, lest the white
appear dim. "When are they to be inspected?" "In the third, fourth,
fifth, seventh, eighth, and ninth hours." The words of Rabbi Meier. R.
Judah said, "in the fourth, fifth, eighth, and ninth hours."

3\. The priest blind of one eye, or with the sight of his eyes dim, must
not inspect lepers; as is said, "Wheresoever the priest looketh." <span
id="fr_599"></span>[2](#fn_593.md) "Is the house dark?" "Windows are not to
be opened in it to inspect its leprosy."

4\. "How is the leper <span id="fr_600"></span>[3](#fn_594.md) to be
inspected?" "The man is to be inspected in the attitude of digging and
pressing olives. The woman is to be inspected as though kneading and
suckling her child, as though weaving in a standing attitude, to the
elbow of the right hand." Rabbi Judah said, "even to the left hand as
though spinning flax."

According to the proportion of leprosy observed is to be the shaving.

5\. A man may inspect all leprosy save his own. Rabbi Meier said, "also
not the leprosy of his relations." A man may absolve all vows save his
own. R. Judah said, "also not the vows of his wife between herself and
others." A man may inspect all the firstborn save his own.
