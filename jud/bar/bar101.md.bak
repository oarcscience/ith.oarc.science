### CHAPTER VII.

1\. When the High Priest entered to worship, three priests had hold of
him, one on his right hand, one on his left hand, and one by the jewels
on his breast-plate. And so soon as the Captain of the Temple heard the
sound of the footsteps of the High Priest as he proceeded on his way, he
lifted the veil for him. He entered the holy place, bowed himself, and
went out. And his brethren the priests entered, and bowed down, and went
out.

2\. The priests came and stood on the steps of the porch. The first came
and stood to the south of his brother priests. And they had five vessels
in their hands,—the flagon in the hand of one, and the cup in the hand
of one, and the censer in the hand of one, and the pan in the hand of
one, and the spoon with its cover in the hand of one. They blessed the
people once. In the city they said the service in three blessings, but
in the sanctuary they said it in one blessing, In the sanctuary they
pronounced the Name <span id="fr_559"></span>[1](#fn_553.md) as it is
written,

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

but in the city they pronounced it by its substitute. <span
id="fr_560"></span>[1](#fn_554.md) In the city the priests raised their
hands (in blessing) opposite their shoulders, but in the sanctuary they
raised them above their heads, excepting the High Priest, who could not
lift his hands above the golden plate. R. Judah said, "even the High
Priest could lift his hands above the golden plate, as is said, 'Aaron
lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them.'" <span
id="fr_561"></span>[2](#fn_555.md)

3\. When the High Priest desired to offer incense, he went up on the
ascent to the altar, and the Sagan (Suffragan) was on his right. When he
reached the half of the ascent, the Sagan took him by his right hand and
helped him up. The first (priest) reached to him the head and hind foot
of the lamb, and he laid his hand on them, and then pushed them away.
The second priest reached out to the first one the two fore-legs, and he
handed them to the High Priest, and he laid his hands upon them, and
then pushed them away; the second priest was dismissed, and he departed,
and so they reached out to him all the members of the lamb, and he laid
his hands upon them and pushed them away; but when he desired, he merely
laid his hands on them, and others pushed them away. He next came to
make a circuit of the altar. "From what place did he begin?" "From the
south-eastern corner, north-eastern, north-western, south-western." They
gave to him the wine for libation. The Sagan stood by the corner of the
altar with the banners in his hand, and two priests stood by the table
of the fat with two silver trumpets in their hands: They sounded a
blast, they blew an alarm, and again they sounded the trumpets. They
came and took their position beside the son of Arza. <span
id="fr_562"></span>[3](#fn_556.md) One stood on his right hand and one
stood on his left. The High Priest bowed down to make the libation, and
the Sagan waved the banners, and the son of Arza clanged the cymbals,
and the Levites intoned the chant.

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When they came to
a full stop, the trumpets sounded, and the people bowed themselves. At
every full stop there was a blast, and at every blast there was bowing
down. This is the order of the daily offering for the service of the
House of our God. May it be His will to build it speedily in our days.
Amen.

4\. The chant which the Levites intoned in the sanctuary on the first
day of the week was, "The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof;
the world, and they that dwell therein." <span
id="fr_563"></span>[1](#fn_557.md) On the second day they said, "Great is
the Lord, and greatly to be praised, in the city of our God, in the
mountain of his holiness." <span id="fr_564"></span>[2](#fn_558.md) On the
third day they said, "God standeth in the congregation of the mighty: He
judgeth among the gods." <span id="fr_565"></span>[3](#fn_559.md) On the
fourth day they said, "O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God,
to whom vengeance belongeth, show thyself." <span
id="fr_566"></span>[4](#fn_560.md) On the fifth day they said, "Sing aloud
unto God our strength, make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob." <span
id="fr_567"></span>[5](#fn_561.md) On the sixth day they said, "The Lord
reigneth, he is clothed with majesty," <span
id="fr_568"></span>[6](#fn_562.md) etc. On the Sabbath they said the chant
composed for the Sabbath day, the chant composed for the future, for the
day to come, when all will be rest and repose for life everlasting.
