### CHAPTER IX.

1\. He who sees a place where signs were wrought for Israel, says,
"Blessed be He who wrought signs for our fathers in this place;" a place
where idolatry has been rooted out,—says, "Blessed be He who hath rooted
idolatry out of our land."

2\. On comets, earthquakes, lightnings, thunder, and tempests, say,
"Blessed be He whose strength and might fill the world." On mountains,
hills, seas, rivers, and deserts, say, "Blessed be He who made the
creation." R. Judah says, when a man sees the great sea he is to say,
"Blessed be He who made the great sea,"—when he sees it at intervals. On
rains, and on good news say, "Blessed be He who is good and beneficent."
On bad news say, "Blessed be the true Judge."

3\. He who has built a new house, or bought new furniture, says,
"Blessed be He who has kept its alive," etc. One must bless for evil the
source of good; and for good the source of evil. "He who supplicates for
what is past?" "Such prayer is vain." "How?" His wife is pregnant, and
he says, "God grant that my wife may bring forth a male

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

child." Such prayer is vain. Or if one on the road hear the voice of
lamentation in the city, and say, "God grant that it may not be my son,
my house," etc., such prayer is vain.

4\. Whoever enters a fortified town must say two prayers, one at his
entrance, and one at his departure. Ben Azai says, "four, two at his
entrance, and two at his departure; he returns thanks for the past, and
supplicates for the future."

5\. Man is bound to bless God for evil, as he is bound to bless Him for
good. For it is said, "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might" <span
id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32) "With all thy heart" means, with both thy
inclinations, the evil as well as the good. "With all thy soul" means,
even should He deprive thee of life; and "with all thy might" means with
all thy wealth. Another opinion is, that "with all thy might" means
whatever measure He metes out unto thee, do thou thank Him with thy
entire might. No man is to be irreverent opposite the eastern gate of
the Temple, for it is opposite the Holy of Holies. No man is to go on
the mountain of the house with his staff, shoes, or purse, nor with dust
on his feet, nor is he to make it a short cut, nor is he to spit at all.
All the seals of the blessings in the sanctuary used to say, "from
eternity." But since the Epicureans perversely taught there is but one
world, it was directed that men should say, "from eternity to eternity."
It was also directed that every man should greet his friend in THE NAME,
as it is said, "And behold Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the
reapers, The Lord (be) with you: and they answered him, The Lord bless
thee." <span id="fr_33"></span>[2](#fn_33) And it is also said, "The
Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour." <span
id="fr_34"></span>[3](#fn_34) And it is said, "Despise not thy mother
when she is old." <span id="fr_35"></span>[4](#fn_35) And it is also
said, "(It is) time for (thee), Lord, to work, for they have made void
thy law." <span id="fr_36"></span>[5](#fn_36) R. Nathan says, "They have
made void thy law because (it is) time for (thee), Lord, to work."
