### CHAPTER VI.

<span class="smallcaps">The Ark</span> which Moses made in the desert
was in length two cubits and a half, and in breadth one cubit and a
half, and in height one cubit and a half, as is said, "And they shall
make an ark of shittim wood, two cubits and a half shall be the length
thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a
half the height thereof." <span id="fr_742"></span>[4](#fn_734.md) R. Meier
said, "with a cubit containing six handbreadths—thus they make fifteen
handbreadths. Take from them twelve handbreadths for the breadth of the
tables, and two handbreadths for the place where the roll of the Law
lay, and half a handbreadth from either side for the thickness of the
ark. And the breadth of the ark was nine handbreadths. Take from them
six handbreadths for the length of the tables,

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

and for the place where the roll of the Law lay, two handbreadths, that
it should not be pressed going in and out, and half a handbreadth on
either side for the thickness of the ark." R. Judah said, "with a cubit
containing five handbreadths," thus there were twelve handbreadths and a
half, and, four tables lay in it—two perfect, and two broken. And the
length of each table was six handbreadths, and their breadth six, and
their thickness three. Take from them twelve handbreadths for the
breadth of the tables, and a fingerbreadth on either side for the
thickness of the ark. And the breadth of the ark was seven handbreadths
and a half. Take from them six handbreadths for the length of the
tables, and one handbreadth for the place where the handles (pillars)
lay; and on it the explanation of the prophets is, "King Solomon made
himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon. He made the pillars thereof of
silver." <span id="fr_743"></span>[1](#fn_735) And (there was.md) a
fingerbreadth on either side for the thickness of the ark, but the roll
of the Law was put on the side, as is said, "And put it in the side of
the ark of the covenant of the LORD." <span
id="fr_744"></span>[2](#fn_736.md) And so with the Philistines, he said,
"And put the jewels of gold, which ye return for a trespass-offering, in
a coffer by the side thereof." <span id="fr_745"></span>[3](#fn_737.md) R.
Judah the son of Lakish, said, "there were two arks, one which abode in
the encampment, and one which went forth with them to war, and in it
were the broken tables," as is said, "And the ark of the covenant of the
Lord went." <span id="fr_746"></span>[4](#fn_738.md) But the one with them
in the encampment contained the roll of the Law. That is what is
written, "Nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and Moses
departed not out of the camp." <span id="fr_747"></span>[5](#fn_739.md) And
so he said with regard to Saul, "And Saul said unto Ahiah, bring hither
the ark of God." <span id="fr_748"></span>[6](#fn_740.md) And so of Uriah
it is said, "The ark, and Israel, and Judah abide in tents." <span
id="fr_749"></span>[7](#fn_741.md) But the ark of the covenant went not
forth to war, save once only, as is said, "So the people sent to Shiloh,
that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of
hosts." <span id="fr_750"></span>[8](#fn_742.md)

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
[R.](errata.htm#10.md) Judah said, "there was nothing in the ark save the
tables of the covenant only," as is said, "There was nothing in the ark
save the two tables of stone." <span
