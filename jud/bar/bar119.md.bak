### CHAPTER XIII.

1\. The indications of leprosy in houses are ten. "It was dull in the
first week, and it went away?" "It must be scraped off, and it is
clean." "It was dull in the second week, and it went away?" "It must be
scraped off, but its owner needs the birds." <span
id="fr_614"></span>[1](#fn_608.md) "It was spreading in the first week?"
"He takes it out, and scrapes it down, and plasters it, and gives it
another week." "If it return?" "It must be broken down." "It did not
return?" "He needs the birds." "It stood still in the first week, and
spread in the second?" "He takes it out and scrapes it down, and
plasters it, and gives it another week." "It returns?" "It must be
broken down." "It did not return?" "He needs the birds." <span
id="fr_615"></span>[2](#fn_609.md) "It stood still in the one week and also
in the other?" "He must take it out, and scrape it down, and plaster it,
and give it another week." "It returns?" "It must be broken down." "It
did not return?" "He needs the birds." <span
id="fr_616"></span>[2](#fn_609.md) "Before he is cleansed by the birds the
leprosy again appeared in it?" "It must be broken down." "And if after
he was cleansed by the birds, the leprosy again appeared in it?" "It
must be inspected as in the beginning."

2\. The corner stone, when it is to be taken out, must be taken out
entirely. "When it is to be broken down?" "A man must break down only
his own part, and leave that of his neighbour." It follows that taking
out is more difficult than breaking down. R. Eliezer said, "in the case
of a house built on the projection of a binding stone, if the leprosy
appeared in the projection, he takes it all away, if it appeared in the
binding stone, he takes that which belongs to him, and leaves that part
which belongs to his neighbour."

3\. "A house, in which the leprosy appeared, has an upper storey on it?"
"The (priest) concedes the beams to the upper storey." "It appeared in
the upper storey?" "He concedes the beams to the house itself." "There
was no upper storey on it?" "The stones and timber and mortar

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

are broken down with it. But the concession (of the beams) saves the
balconies upon them, and the lattices of the windows." R. Judah said, "a
battlement built over it is to be broken down with it, its stones and
timbers and mortar cause uncleanness in the measure of an olive." R.
Eleazar Hashma said, "however little they be."

4\. A house which is shut up, causes uncleanness inside. "But that house
which is decided unclean inside and outside?" "Both inside and outside
it causes uncleanness by one entering into it."

5\. "Suppose stones built into a clean house from one legally shut up,
and the leprosy again returned to the house?" "He must take the stones
away." "If the leprosy returned to the stones?" "The first house must be
broken down, and the stones may serve for the second house with marks."

6\. "A house which covers over a leprous house, and also a tree which
covers over a leprous house?" "He who entered the outer one is clean."
The words of R. Eliezer, son of Azariah. Said R. Eliezer, "what! if one
stone of it causes uncleanness by entrance into it, should not the house
itself also cause uncleanness by entrance into it?"

7\. "One unclean with leprosy stood beneath a tree, and one clean passed
by?" "The latter becomes unclean." "One clean stood beneath the tree,
and one unclean passed by?" "The former remains clean." "If he stood?"
"The one clean becomes unclean." "And if one passed by with a leprous
stone?" "He remains clean," "But if he stops?" "The one clean becomes
unclean."

8\. "A clean person entered with his head and the greater part of his
body into an unclean house?" "He becomes unclean." "And an unclean
person entered with his head and the greater part of his body into a
clean house?" "He renders it unclean." A clean garment, of which three
fingers square, entered an unclean house, is rendered unclean, and the
unclean garment, which enters even the size of an olive into a clean
house, causes legal uncleanness.

9\. "He who enters a leprous house, with his garments on his shoulder,
and his sandals and rings in his hand?"

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "He and they are
instantly unclean. If he be dressed in his clothes and his sandals on
his feet, and his rings on his fingers, he is instantly unclean: but
they remain clean, whilst he can eat half a loaf <span
id="fr_617"></span>[1](#fn_610.md) of wheaten, but not of barley bread. He
may sit and eat it with soup."

10\. "If one stood within a leprous house, and stretched his hand
outside and his rings were in his hand, or if he remained whilst he
could eat half a loaf?" "They are unclean." "If he stood outside and
stretched his hand inside the leprous house, and his rings were in his
hand?" R. Judah pronounces them "instantly unclean," but the Sages say,
"not until he could have time to eat half a loaf." They said to R. Judah
"what! if in the time all his body is unclean, no uncleanness is
produced in that which is upon him, until he remain whilst he can eat
half a loaf—is it not the legal decision that, in the time all his body
is clean he does not render that which is upon him unclean till he
remain the time for eating half a loaf."

11\. "A leper enters a house?" "All the vessels there are unclean, even
up to the beams of the house." Rabbi Simon said, "up to four cubits
high." Vessels are instantly unclean. R. Judah said, "vessels are
rendered unclean if he remain till he can light a candle."

12\. If he entered the synagogue, the congregation makes for him a
division ten handbreadths high, and in breadth four cubits. He must
enter first and go out last. All covering bound <span
id="fr_618"></span>[2](#fn_611.md) saves from legal uncleanness in the tent
of the dead. The covering bound also saves from uncleanness in the
leprous house. "And everything which saves from uncleanness in the tent
of the dead with a cover only, such also saves from uncleanness in a
leprous house." The words of R. Meier. R. José said, "every covering
bound which saves in the tent of the dead also saves in the leprous
house when covered only. And everything which saves from uncleanness
when covered in the tent of the dead, even though it be uncovered in the
leprous house, is clean."

kind of chorus such as is found in the Greek poets. It is used like one
in the Thyrsis of Theocritus.
