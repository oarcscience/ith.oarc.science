### CHAPTER II.

1\. His brethren saw him come down, and they came running to him. They
hastened and sanctified their hands and their feet from the laver. They
took the brushes and the forks, and went up to the top of the altar. The
members and the cauls <span id="fr_537"></span>[1](#fn_531.md) (of the
sacrifices) which were not consumed over night, they moved to the side
of the altar. If the sides could not contain them, they laid them out in
a closet at the ascent.

2\. They commenced to bring up the ashes to the top of the heap, <span
id="fr_538"></span>[2](#fn_532.md) and the heap was on the middle of the
altar. Sometimes there was on it about three hundred cors; <span
id="fr_539"></span>[3](#fn_533.md) but in the holidays they did not clear
away the ashes, since they were an honour for the altar. Never was the
priest lazy in removing the ashes.

3\. The priests began bringing up the faggots to arrange the fire of
preparation on the altar. "Was, then, all wood allowed for preparation?"
"Yes, all wood was allowed for the fire of preparation, except that of
the olive and that of the vine. But these they preferred,—branches of
the fig tree, of the nut, and of the pine."

4\. The priests arranged the great fire of preparation eastward, and
then made an opening eastward, so that the heads of the inward faggots
touched the heap on the altar. And there was a division between the
faggots, that the priests might kindle the chips there.

5\. The priest chose from the faggots the best figwood to arrange the
second fire of preparation for the incense opposite the western horn
southwards. He prolonged it from the

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

horn towards the north four cubits, reckoning for five seahs <span
id="fr_540"></span>[1](#fn_534.md) of live coals, and on the Sabbath he
reckoned for eight seahs of live coals. As they placed there the two
cups of frankincense of the showbread. The members and cauls (of the
sacrifices) which were not consumed by the fire overnight, were returned
again by the priests to the great fire of preparation. And they kindled
both the preparations with fire; and they came down, and entered into
the chamber of hewn stone. <span id="fr_541"></span>[2](#fn_535.md)
