### CHAPTER IV.

The vail was woven ten cubits square, and there were made in it four
loops, and it was hung on hooks on the tops of the pillars, and it was
spread in the third portion of the tabernacle, that there should be from
it inwards ten cubits, and from it outwards twenty cubits, as is said,
"And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches." <span
id="fr_723"></span>[2](#fn_716) It follows that the place of the Holy of
Holies was ten cubits square, and there were put the ark, and the pot of
manna, and the pan of anointing oil, and Aaron's rod with its almonds
and flowers; and there Aaron entered four times on the day of atonement.
Outside the vail were placed the table and candlestick. But the table
was on the north, and opposite to it was the candlestick on the south;
as is said, "And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the
candlestick over against the table." <span
id="fr_724"></span>[3](#fn_717) And as they were placed in the tent of
the congregation, so were they placed in the everlasting House. <span
id="fr_725"></span>[4](#fn_718) Now the tent of the congregation was in
length thirty cubits, and in breadth ten cubits. But the everlasting
House was in length sixty cubits, and in breadth twenty cubits. This
teaches that the tent of the congregation was one-fourth part of the
everlasting House. And as the vail was woven, so was woven the ephod and
the breastplate, only in these there was an additional thread of gold;
as is said, "And they did beat the gold into thin plates and cut it into
wires." <span id="fr_726"></span>[5](#fn_719) As was the weaving of the
covering vail, so was the weaving of the covering for the entrance. But
the vail was cunning work, as is said, "Thou shalt make the vail of blue
and purple," etc.; "cunning work." <span id="fr_727"></span>[6](#fn_720)
But the covering of the entrance was needle-work, as is said, "And thou
shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent," etc., "of
needle-work." <span id="fr_728"></span>[7](#fn_721) The words of R.

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nehemiah. R.
Nehemiah usually said, "every place where it is said cunning work (there
were) two figures—in the needlework (there was) but one figure only."
And the branches of the candlestick were right opposite to the breadth
of the table. And the golden altar was placed in the middle of the
house, and divided the house, and its half inwards was right opposite to
the ark; as is said, "And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by
the ark of the testimony before the mercy-seat." <span
id="fr_729"></span>[1](#fn_722) From the boards on the south to the
branches of the candlestick (there were) two cubits and a half. And from
the branches of the candlestick to the table (there were) five cubits.
And from the table to the boards on the north (were) two cubits and a
half. This teaches that the breadth of the Holy place (was) ten cubits.
From the boards on the west to the vail (were) ten cubits. From the vail
to the table were five cubits. From the table to the golden altar (were)
five cubits. From the golden altar to the boards on the east (were) ten
cubits. This teaches that the length of the tabernacle was thirty
cubits.
