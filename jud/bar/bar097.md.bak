### CHAPTER III.

1\. The Captain of the Temple said to the priests, "come and cast lots."
"Who is to slaughter?" "Who is to sprinkle?" "Who is to take the ashes
from the inner altar?" "Who is to take the ashes from the candlestick?"
"Who is to bring up the members to the ascent, the head and the right
foot, and the two hind feet, the chine, and the left foot, the breast,
and the throat, and the two sides, the inwards, and the fine flour, and
the pancakes and the wine?" They cast lots, and he gained who gained.

2\. The Captain said to them, "go and see if the time for slaughter
approaches?" If it approached, the watchman said, "it brightens."
Matthia, son of Samuel, said, "is it light in the whole east, even to
Hebron?" and he said, "yes."

3\. He said to them, "go and bring the lamb from the lamb-chamber." The
lamb-chamber was in the north-west corner of the court, and there were
four chambers there, one the lamb-chamber, one the seal-chamber, <span
id="fr_542"></span>[3](#fn_536.md) and one chamber for the burning
materials, and one chamber where they made showbread.

4\. The priests entered the chamber for the vessels, and they brought
out ninety-three vessels of silver and gold.

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They made the
daily sacrifice drink in a golden cup. Even though he was examined the
night before, they examined him again by torch-light.

5\. He who gained the lot for the daily sacrifice, led the lamb to the
slaughter-house, and those who gained the lots for the members, went
after him. The slaughter-house was to the north of the altar, and in it
were eight dwarf pillars, and beams of cedar wood were fastened upon
them, and iron hooks were fastened in them. And there were three rows of
hooks to each of them. Upon them the priests hung the sacrifices, and
skinned them, near the marble tables between the pillars.

6\. Those who gained the lot for the removal of the ashes from the inner
altar, and the ashes from the candlestick, advanced with four vessels in
their hands, a flagon <span id="fr_543"></span>[1](#fn_537.md) and a
cup <span id="fr_544"></span>[2](#fn_538.md) and two keys. The flagon
resembled a great golden measure containing two cabs and an half. And
the cup resembled a great golden jug. And the two keys to the sanctuary.
One key entered the lock up to the shoulder of the priest, and one
opened quickly.

7\. The priest came to the wicket on the north, and there were two
wickets in the great gate, one in the north and one in the south.
Through that in the south man never entered, and Ezekiel explains it.
"Then said the Lord unto me: This gate shall be shut, it shall not be
opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the Lord, the God of
Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut." <span
id="fr_545"></span>[3](#fn_539.md) He took the key and opened the wicket;
he entered the chamber, and he went from the chamber into the sanctuary,
until he came to the great gate. When he came to the great gate, he took
down the bar and the bolts and opened it. The slaughterer did not
slaughter till he heard the noise of the opening of the great gate.

8\. From Jericho <span id="fr_546"></span>[4](#fn_540.md) people heard the
opening of the great gate. From Jericho they heard the noise of the
shovel. <span id="fr_547"></span>[5](#fn_541.md)

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> From Jericho they
heard the noise of the wooden wheel which the son of Kattin made for the
laver. From Jericho they heard the voice of Gabini the herald. From
Jericho they heard the sound of the cornet. From Jericho they heard the
sound of the cymbal. From Jericho they heard the voice of the song. From
Jericho they heard the clang of the horn, and some say even the voice of
the High Priest at the time when he mentioned the Name on the Day of
Atonement. From Jericho they smelt the odour of the preparation of
incense. Said R. Eleazar, the son of Daglai, "the family of Aba had
goats on the mountains of Mikvor, <span id="fr_548"></span>[1](#fn_542.md)
and they used to sneeze from the odour of the preparation of the
incense."

9\. The priest who gained the lot for removing the ashes from the inner
altar entered, and took the flagon and laid it before him, and he took
handfuls of ashes and filled them into the flagon, and at last he
brushed the remainder into it. And he left it and went out (of the holy
place). He who gained the lot for removing the snuff from the
candlestick, entered and found the two eastern lights burning. He
snuffed the rest, and left these burning in their place. If he found
them extinguished, he snuffed them, and lighted them again from those
still burning, and afterwards he snuffed the rest. And there was a stone
before the candlestick, and in it were three steps, on which the priest
stood and trimmed the lights. And he placed the cup with the snuff on
the second step, and went out.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_536"></span>[245:3](bar097.htm#fr_542.md) In this chamber were
kept the "seals" or "tokens" given to those persons who bought their
offerings from the Levites. These "seals" were of four sorts, and were
respectively inscribed with "calf" or "kid," according to the offerings
to be presented; and with the word "male" when the offering was to be a
ram; and "sinner" when it was to be a sin-offering.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[246:1](bar097.htm#fr_543.md) Others read a
basket.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[246:2](bar097.htm#fr_544.md) Or jug.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[246:3](bar097.htm#fr_545.md) Ezek. xliv. 2.

eighteen miles distant from Jerusalem.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[246:5](bar097.htm#fr_547.md) Perhaps "a gong" or
"a bell." Some think it to have been "a musical instrument," and others
consider it to have been "an organ."

<span id="fn_542"></span>[247:1](bar097.htm#fr_548.md) Some think
"Machærus" on the east of the Dead Sea, about 50 miles distant from
Jerusalem.
