### CHAPTER IV.

1\. "A place in which men are accustomed to do work on the eve of the
passover?" "For half a day they may work." "A place in which they are
not accustomed to work?" "They must not work." "If one goes from a place
where they work to a place where they do not work; or from a place where
they do not work to a place where they

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

do work?" "The Sages put on him the burden <span
id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_133) of the place from which he went, or the
burden of the place to which he came; but a man should not change the
customs of a place, as it causes quarrels."

2\. Like to him is he who carried fruits of the Sabbatical year from a
place where they were finished growing to a place where they were not
finished growing; or from a place where they were not finished to a
place where they were finished. He is bound to remove them. Rabbi Judah
said, "they can say to him, go and bring them for yourself from the
field." <span id="fr_137"></span>[2](#fn_134)

3\. "A place in which men are accustomed to sell small cattle to
Gentiles?" "They may sell them." "A place in which they are not
accustomed to sell them?" "They may not sell them." But in no place may
they sell working cattle—calves, ass-foals, either unblemished or broken
down. <span id="fr_138"></span>[3](#fn_135) Rabbi Judah "allowed the
broken down." The son of Bethira "allowed a horse."

4\. "A place where men are accustomed to eat roast meat on the night of
the passover?" "They may eat it." "A place in which they are not
accustomed to eat it?" "They may not eat it." "A place in which they are
accustomed to light a candle on the night of the Day of Atonement?"
"They may light it." "A place in which they are not accustomed to light
it?" "They may not light it." But men may light candles in the
synagogues, and in the schools, and in the dark streets, and for the
sick.

5\. "A place in which men are accustomed to do work on the ninth of
Ab;" <span id="fr_139"></span>[4](#fn_136) "They may work." "A place in
which they are not accustomed to work?" "They may not work." But
everywhere the disciples of the Sages are idle. Rabban Simon, the son of
Gamaliel, said, "a man may always make himself a disciple of the Sages."
But the Sages say, "in Judah they did work on the eves of the passovers
for half a day, and in Galilee they did nothing." And work in

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

the night before the passover the school of Shammai disallowed; but the
school of Hillel "allowed it till sunrise."

6\. Rabbi Meier said, "every work which was begun before the fourteenth
day of Nisan may be finished on the fourteenth; but it must not be
commenced on the fourteenth, even though it can be finished." And the
Sages say, "three trades can carry on business on the eves of the
passovers for half a day; and these are they—the tailors, and the
barbers, and the washers." Rabbi José, the son of Judah, said, "also
shoemakers."

7\. Persons may set hens on their nests on the fourteenth. "But if the
hen ran off?" "They may return her to her place." "And if she died?"
"They may set another instead of her." They may clear away from beneath
the feet of beasts on the fourteenth. But on the holiday (or
middle-days) they put it aside. They may carry to, and bring vessels
from, the house of the trader, even though they be not necessary for the
holiday.

8\. The men of Jericho did six things, in three they were prohibited,
and in three they were allowed. And these are they in which they were
allowed: they engrafted dates the whole fourteenth day of Nisan, and
they shortened the "Hear," <span id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_137) and
they reaped and stacked new corn before "the sheaf" <span
id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_138) was offered; and they were allowed. And
in these they were prohibited: they used the produce of what was
consecrated, and they ate on the Sabbath the fruit that had fallen down
from the trees, and they gave <span id="fr_142"></span>[3](#fn_139) (to
the poor) the corners of the fields of vegetables. And the Sages
prohibited them from these things. <span id="fr_143"></span>[4](#fn_140)

#### 9. BEREITHA—EXTERNAL TRADITION.

Hezekiah the king did six things; to three the Sages consented, and to
three they did not consent. He carried the bones of his father (Ahaz) on
a rope bed, <span id="fr_144"></span>[5](#fn_141) and they consented.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He powdered the
brazen serpent, <span id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_142) and they
consented. He concealed the book of medicines, <span
id="fr_146"></span>[2](#fn_143) and they consented. And to three they
did not consent: he cut off (the gold from) the doors of the
temple <span id="fr_147"></span>[3](#fn_144) and sent it to the Assyrian
king, and they did not consent. He stopped the waters of the upper
Gihon, <span id="fr_148"></span>[4](#fn_145) and they did not consent.
He introduced an intercalary Nisan, and they did not consent.
