### CHAPTER VI.

1\. Both he-goats for the day of atonement are commanded to be alike in
colour, and in stature, and in price, and to be selected at the same
time, and although they be not equal, yet are they lawful. "If one be
selected to-day and the other to-morrow?" "They are lawful." "If one of
them died?" "If he die before the lot be cast, the priest shall take a
pair for the second; and if after the lot be cast he die, the priest
shall fetch another pair, and cast the lot over them anew." And he shall
say, "if that for the Name die, this over which this lot comes will be a
substitute for the Name; and if that for Azazel die, this over which
this lot comes will be a substitute for Azazel." And the second shall go
to pasture, until he become blemished, and he shall be sold, and his
price must be put into the offertory. Since

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

the sin-offering of the congregation dies not. R. Judah said, "thou
shalt die;" <span id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_221.md) and again said R.
Judah, "is his blood shed?" "The one to be sent forth shall die." "Has
the one to be sent forth died?" "His blood shall be shed."

2\. The high priest came to the side of the goat to be sent forth, and
he placed his two hands <span id="fr_226"></span>[2](#fn_222.md) on him and
made confession, and thus he spake: "I beseech Thee, O Name, Thy people,
the house of Israel, have done perversely, have transgressed and sinned
before Thee. I beseech Thee, O Name, pardon now their perverse doings,
and their transgressions, and their sins, which they have perversely
committed, and transgressed, and sinned before thee. Thy people the
house of Israel, as is written in the law of Moses Thy servant, saying,
'For on that day shall he make an atonement for you to cleanse you from
all your sins; before the LORD ye shall be pure.' <span
id="fr_227"></span>[3](#fn_223.md) And the priests and the people who stood
in the court, on hearing the Name clearly pronounced by the mouth of the
High Priest, knelt and worshipped, and fell on their faces and said,
'BLESSED BE THE NAME. THE HONOUR OF HIS KINGDOM FOR EVER AND EVER.'"

3\. They delivered (the goat) to his conductor. All were eligible for
conducting him. But the great priests made a rule, and they did not
permit Israel to lead him forth. Said R. Joseph, "it occurred that
Arsela of Zippori lead him forth, and he was an Israelite."

4\. And they made steps <span id="fr_228"></span>[4](#fn_224.md) for him by
reason of the Babylonians, <span id="fr_229"></span>[5](#fn_225.md) who
plucked off his hair and said to him, "take and go, take and go." The
nobles of Jerusalem escorted him to the first booth. There were ten
booths from Jerusalem to Zuk, <span
id="fr_230"></span>[6](#fn_226.md)—ninety stadia—seven and a half to every
mile.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

5\. At every booth they said to him, "there is food, there is water,"
and they escorted him from booth to booth, except the last. For they
came not with him to Zuk, but stood afar off and saw his acts.

6\. "What did he do?" "His conductor divided the tongue of brightness
(iv. 2.) Half he twisted on the rock, and half he twisted between his
horns. And he thrust him backwards, and the goat rolled, and descended,
and he had not reached to the half of the mountain, till his members
were made members. <span id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_227.md) He returned and
sat under the last booth until darkness set in." "And when did he render
garments unclean?" <span id="fr_232"></span>[2](#fn_228.md) "From his exit
from the wall of Jerusalem." R. Simon said, "from the time of his
thrusting at Zuk."

7\. The High Priest came beside the bullock and he-goat which were to be
burned. He cleft them, and brought out their entrails. He put them on a
dish, and caused them to smoke upon the altar. He folded them in their
skins, and caused them to be carried to the place of burning. "And when
did he render garments unclean?" "From his proceeding without the wall
of the court." R. Simon said, "when the fire kindled on the greatest
part" (of the sacrifice).

8\. They said to the High Priest, "the he-goat has arrived in the
wilderness." "And whence knew they that the he-goat had arrived in the
wilderness?" "They set watchmen, who waved handkerchiefs, and they knew
that the he-goat had arrived in the wilderness." Said R. Judah, "and was
not this a great sign to them? from Jerusalem to Bethhoron <span
id="fr_233"></span>[3](#fn_229.md) there were three miles. They went a mile
and returned, and rested the time of a mile, and they knew that the
he-goat arrived in the desert." R. Ishmael <span
id="fr_234"></span>[4](#fn_230.md) said, "and was there not another sign to
them? a tongue of brightness was twisted on the door of the Sanctuary,
and when the he-goat arrived

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

in the wilderness the tongue blanched, as is said, "Though your sins be
as scarlet, they shall be white as snow." <span
id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_231.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_221"></span>[130:1](bar054.htm#fr_225.md) R. Judah addresses
in imagination the goat.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[130:2](bar054.htm#fr_226.md) It seems, according
to the Talmud, that there was no "laying on of hands" on either the
morning or evening sacrifice; or on any other public sacrifice,
excepting the scapegoat and the bullock, when the congregation had
sinned through ignorance.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[130:3](bar054.htm#fr_227.md) Lev. xvi. 30.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[130:4](bar054.htm#fr_228.md) Or viaduct, or
causeway.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[130:5](bar054.htm#fr_229.md) Supposed to be
Alexandrine Jews, so called from hatred to the Babylonians.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[130:6](bar054.htm#fr_230.md) Zuk is supposed by
Lieutenant Conder of the Palestine Exploration Fund to be the modern el
Mûntâr, about six and a half miles east of Jerusalem in the direction of
the Dead Sea, and on the way to the ruins of Mird (Mons Mardes). A well
near the place is still called Bîr es Sûk.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[131:1](bar054.htm#fr_231.md) *i.e.* broken to
pieces.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[131:2](bar054.htm#fr_232.md) Maimonides says that
those connected with the red heifer and scapegoat were rendered unclean
because these animals were "sin-bearing" animals. All that Israelites
now have to offer on the day of atonement is for males a white cock
(because gever in Hebrew signifies a man and a cock), and for females a
hen. And they pray, "Let this be my substitute,—this my atonement. This
cock goeth to death, but may I be gathered and enter into a long and
happy life, and into peace."

<span id="fn_229"></span>[131:3](bar054.htm#fr_233.md) "Place of the
hollow."

External Traditions.
