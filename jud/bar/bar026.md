### CHAPTER VI.

1\. Three countries (are included) in the laws of the Sabbatical year.
In all the possessions of those who returned from Babylon—from the
(border) of the land of Israel and to Cezib, <span
id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_61.md) we may not eat cultivated fruit, and we
may not cultivate the ground. And in all the possessions of those who
came up from Egypt from Cezib, <span id="fr_62"></span>[2](#fn_61.md) and
to the

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

river of Egypt, and to the Amana, <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_62.md) we
may eat cultivated fruits, but we may not cultivate the ground. From the
river of Egypt, and from the Amana to the interior, we may eat the
fruits and cultivate the ground.

2\. Men may labour in that which is separated from the ground in Syria,
but not in that which is attached to the ground. They may thresh, and
shovel, and tread out, and make sheaves, but they must not reap the
grain nor glean the grapes, nor beat the olives. This is the rule; said
Rabbi Akiba, "all things similar to that which is allowed in the land of
Israel, men may do in Syria."

3\. "Onions upon which fell rain and they sprouted?" "If the leaves on
them be dark, they are forbidden; if green, they are allowed." Rabbi
Chanina, the son of Antigonus, said, "if they can be pulled up by their
leaves they are forbidden; and contrariwise if it happened so in the
close of the Sabbatical year, they are allowed."

4\. "From what time may men buy greens at the close of the Sabbatical
year?" "From the time that similar young ones are produced. If the
earlier ones are prematurely ripened, then the later ones are allowed."
Rabbi <span id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_63.md) allowed greens to be bought
off-hand at the close of the Sabbatical year.

5\. Men must not export oil <span id="fr_65"></span>[3](#fn_64.md) which is
only to be burned, nor fruits of the Sabbatical year, from the Land to
lands abroad. Said Rabbi Simon, "I expressly heard that they may be
exported to Syria, but that they must not be exported to lands abroad."

6\. Men must not import a heave-offering from abroad into the land. Said
Rabbi Simon, "I expressly heard that they may import it from Syria, but
that they must not import it from lands abroad."
