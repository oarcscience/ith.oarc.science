### CHAPTER VI.

#### RABBINIC LOGIC.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Rabbis have laid down thirteen rules
for the interpretation of the Talmud. These rules form their system of
logic. They are as follows:—

(1.) *Light and heavy*, an argument from the less to the greater. An
example is furnished in the case of Miriam (Num. xii. 14). "If her
father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days?
let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be
received in again." The argument is here drawn from the conduct of man,
the less, to that of God, the greater. The owner of an ox is also fined
more for his beast if it gores his neighbour's beast than if it eats his
neighbour's corn; since the tooth only means sustenance for the stomach,
but the horn means mischief.

(2.) *Equality*, an argument from the similarity or identity of words
and impressions. An example is furnished in Deut. xv. 12: "If thy
brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve
thee six years, then in the seventh year thou shalt let him free from
thee." In the 18th verse, when this law is again referred to, the man
only is mentioned; but as the woman was mentioned in the former verse,
it is concluded that the law applies equally to both.

(3.) *The building of the father*, an argument from the statements in
(a) *one* place in the Law to other passages, which are similar. An
example is furnished in Exod. xii. 16, where servile work is forbidden
during the feast of unleavened bread, and the conclusion is drawn that
servile

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

work is equally forbidden in all festivals of the same nature. This mode
of argument is also applied to (b) two places in the Law, where one
place refers to the general proposition, and another to particulars
arising out of it. An example is furnished in Lev. xv. 1, where a man
with an issue is unclean, but in the 4th verse this uncleanness is
limited to his bed and his seat.

(4.) *Universal and particular;* Where there is a general and a special
statement, the special binds the general. An example is furnished in
Lev. i. 2: "If any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord, ye shall
bring your offering of the cattle, even of the herd and of the flock."
Cattle (in the Hebrew Behemah) includes both wild and tame. The special
terms "herd" and "flock" limit the offering to domesticated animals.

(5.) *Particular and universal*, or argument from the special to the
general. An example is furnished in Deut. xxii. 1: "Thou shalt not see
thy brother's ox, or his sheep go astray: thou shalt in any case bring
them again unto thy brother." In the 3d verse, it is further commanded
to restore "all lost things of thy brother's." Hence it is concluded,
not only his ox or his sheep, but that everything, which he has lost is
to be restored to him.

(6.) *Universal, particular and universal;* Where there are two
universal statements with a particular statement between, the particular
limits the universals. An example is furnished in Deut. xiv. 26, where,
speaking of the application of the second tithe, it is said, "Thou shalt
bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after; for oxen, or
for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul
desireth." The special limitation, between the two universal
permissions, is to productions of the land of Canaan.

(7.) *The general that requires the special, and the special that
requires the general*. An example is furnished in Lev. xvii. 13:
"Whatsoever man . . . hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be
eaten, he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with
dust." The word

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "cover" or "hide"
is again used in Gen. xviii. 17: "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing
which I shall do?" The conclusion is drawn, that cover is restricted to
the blood being hidden under dust, and not put in any vessel. Again
(Exod. xiii. 2): "Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatever openeth
the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and beast, it is
mine." From this verse females might be included with males. Reference
is made to Deut. xv. 19, where it is found "All the firstling males."
Still it is obscure, when there are firstling females, about the males
born afterwards. Reference is made to Exod. xxxiv. 19: "All that openeth
the matrix is mine." Here all first-born are allowed. This, however is
too general, and it is again restricted by the word *males*. And as this
is too general, it is again restricted by "all that openeth the matrix."

(8.) *Whatsoever is taught in general and something special is
mentioned—it is mentioned to strengthen the general rule*. An example is
furnished in Lev. xx. 2, where the worship of Moloch is forbidden, and
the penalty for the sin is death. The conclusion drawn is, that such
mention of a special form of idolatry confirms the prohibition of all
idolatry.

(9.) *When there is a general rule and also an exception—the exception
lightens and does not aggravate*. An example is furnished in the command
(Exod. xxi. 12), "He that smiteth a man so that he die, he shall surely
be put to death." The exception is, "Whoso killeth his neighbour
ignorantly" (Deut. xix. 4, 5), "he can flee to one of the cities of
refuge."

(10.) *When there is a general rule, and an exception not agreeing with
the general rule, the exception both lightens and aggravates*. An
example is furnished from the plague of leprosy (Lev. xiii. 3) when the
hair is turned white. The head and beard are excepted (29th verse) lest
there be grey hairs—this lightens. But if on the head and beard there be
"yellow thin hair," it is a dry scall—this aggravates.

(11.) *When there is an exception from a general rule to establish a new
matter—the new matter cannot be brought under the general rule again,
unless it be mentioned in the* 

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

*text*. An example is furnished from the eating of holy things (Lev.
xxii. 10-13). The priest, any soul bought with his money, and he that is
born in his house, may eat of it. This is the *general* rule. If the
priest's daughter be married to a stranger, she may not eat of them.
This is the *exception*. This exception would have remained if she
continued married to a stranger, or had a child, or had not returned to
her father's house. Therefore a new law is provided, that in the event
of none of these things happening, she may again eat of the holy things.

(12.) *Things that teach from the subject, and things that teach from
the end*.—An example is furnished from the eighth commandment, "Thou
shalt not steal." This law, if applied to man-stealing or kidnapping,
implies capital punishment. The reason given is from its following "Thou
shalt do no murder," and "Thou shall not commit adultery"—two laws
which, if violated, entailed death. The second part of this rule applies
to things that teach from the end. What is meant by *the end* is a
matter of dispute. Some say it means the final cause of logicians.
Others say it means something in the end or conclusion of the law
itself. If it be the latter, an example is furnished from the case of
the leprous house (Lev. xiv. 45): "And he shall break down the house,
the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the
house." These directions teach that houses made of mud are excepted.

(13.) *When two texts contradict each other, until a third be found to
decide between them*. An example is furnished in Gen. i. 1: "In the
beginning God created the heaven and the earth." It is again written,
Gen. ii. 4, "In the day that the Lord made the earth and the heavens."
The question now arises, Which did He make first? The answer is found in
Isaiah xlviii. 13: "Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the
earth, and My right hand hath spanned the heavens." The conclusion is
drawn that He made both at once. Another instance is the discrepancy in
the census of Israel. In 2 Sam. xxiv. 9 the number stated is eight
hundred thousand. In 1 Chron. xxi. 5 the number is said

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

to have been "eleven hundred thousand." The difference of three hundred
thousand is accounted for by referring to 1 Chron. xxvii. 1, where it is
said that twenty-four thousand served the king every month. These men,
when multiplied by the months, make two hundred and eighty-eight
thousand. And the twelve thousand which waited upon the twelve captains
raise the number to three hundred thousand, the amount required to
reconcile the two statements.
