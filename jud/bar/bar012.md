schools of Shammai and Hillel—Reverence for the Temple.</span>

### CHAPTER I.

1\. "From what time do we recite the Shemah <span
id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) in the evening?" "From the hour the
priests <span id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8) enter (the temple.md) to eat
their heave offerings, until the end of the first watch." <span
id="fr_9"></span>[3](#fn_9.md) The words of R. Eleazar; but the Sages say
"until midnight" Rabban Gamaliel says, "until the pillar of the morn
ascend." It happened that his sons came from a banquet. They said to
him, "we have not yet said the Shemah." He said to them, "if the pillar
of the morn be not yet ascended, you are bound to say it; and not only
this, but all that the

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sages say, 'till
midnight,' they command till the pillar of the morn ascend." The burning
of the fat and members they command "till the pillar of the morn
ascend." And all offerings, which must be eaten the same day, they
command "till the pillar of the morn ascend." If so, why do the Sages
say "until midnight?" "To withhold man from transgression."

2\. "From what time do we recite the Shemah in the morning?" When one
can discern betwixt "blue and white," R. Eleazar says "betwixt blue and
leek green." And it may be finished "until the sun shine forth." R.
Joshua says "until the third hour." <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md)
For such is the way of royal princes to rise at the third hour. He who
recites Shemah afterwards loses nothing. He is like a man reading the
Law.

3\. The school of Shammai say that in the evening all men are to recline
when they recite the Shemah; and in the morning they are to stand up;
for it is said, "when thou liest down and when thou risest up." <span
id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md) But the school of Hillel say, "that every
man is to recite it in his own way; for it is said "when thou walkest by
the way." <span id="fr_12"></span>[3](#fn_12.md) If so, why is it said,
"when thou liest down and when thou risest up"? "When mankind usually
lie down, and when mankind usually rise up." R. Tarphon said, "I came on
the road, and reclined to recite the Shemah according to the words of
the school of Shammai, and I was in danger of robbers." The *Sages* said
to him, "thou wast guilty against thyself, because thou didst transgress
the words of the school of Hillel."

4\. In the morning two blessings are said before (the Shemah), and one
after it; and in the evening two blessings before and two after it, one
long and one short. <span id="fr_13"></span>[4](#fn_13.md) Where the
(Sages) have said to lengthen, none is allowed to shorten; and to
shorten none is allowed to lengthen: to close, none is allowed not to
close; not to close, none is allowed to close.

5\. We commemorate the departure from Egypt at night;

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

said R. Eleazar, son of Azariah, "truly I am a son of seventy years, and
was not clear that thou shouldst say the departure from Egypt at night
until the son of Zoma expounded, 'that thou mayest remember the day when
thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy
life;' <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14) the days of thy life (are.md)
days; all the days of thy life (include) the nights." But the Sages say,
"the days of thy life (are) this world; all the days of thy life
(include) the days of the Messiah."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_7"></span>[49:1](bar012.htm#fr_7.md) "Hear, O Israel, the Lord
our God is one Lord," etc. (Deut. vi. 4-9, xi. 13-21; Num. xv. 37-41).
Evening prayer might be said after 12.30 P.M. (Acts x. 9.) It is
abundantly evident from the Zohar that the ancient Jews understood that
in the Shemah there was a confession of the doctrine of the Trinity in
unity—three Persons in One God. "Hear, O Israel: Jehovah our God is one
Jehovah. By the first name in this sentence, Jehovah, is signified God
the Father, the Head of all things. By the next words, our God, is
signified God the Son, the fountain of all knowledge; and by the second
Jehovah, is signified God the Holy Ghost, proceeding of them both; to
all which is added the word One, to signify that these three are
Indivisible. But this mystery shall not be revealed until the coming of
Messiah." The Zohar gives also an imperfect illustration of this great
Truth, by saying that the Trinity in unity is like "the human voice
which is composed of three elements—warmth, air, and vapour."

<span id="fn_8"></span>[49:2](bar012.htm#fr_8.md) Priests who were legally
unclean. (Lev. xxii. 7).

<span id="fn_9"></span>[49:3](bar012.htm#fr_9.md) The Mishna begins the
night at 6 P.M., and divides it into three watches of four hours each.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[50:1](bar012.htm#fr_10.md) The Mishna begins the
day at 6 a.m. The third hour is 9 A.M.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[50:2](bar012.htm#fr_11.md) Deut. vi. 7.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[50:3](bar012.htm#fr_12.md) *Ibid*.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[50:4](bar012.htm#fr_13.md) A long blessing begins
and ends with "Blessed art Thou, O Lord;" a short blessing only ends
with these words.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[51:1](bar012.htm#fr_14.md) Deut. xvi. 3.
