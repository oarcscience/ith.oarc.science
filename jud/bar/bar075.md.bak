### CHAPTER III.

1\. "Judgments in money matters (require) three judges. This party
chooses for himself one, and the other party chooses for himself one.
And both parties choose another." The words of R. Meier. But the Sages
say, "the two judges choose for themselves the other." "This one may
declare the judge of that one illegal. And that one may declare the
judge of this one illegal." The words of R. Meier. But the Sages say,
"it is only when witness can be brought against them that they are
related or unlawful." "But if they be righteous or experienced, they
must not be declared illegal." "This one may declare illegal the witness
of that one. And that one may declare illegal the witness of this

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

one." The words of R. Meier. But the Sages say, "it is only when witness
can be brought against them that they are related or unlawful, but if
they be righteous they must not be declared illegal."

2\. One said to the other, "I trust my father," "I trust thy father," "I
trust three cowherds." R. Meier said, "he may change his mind." But the
Sages say, "he must not change." If he must give an oath to his
companion, and he said to him, "vow to me by the life of thy head?" R.
Meier said, "he may change his mind." But the Sages say, "he must not
change his mind."

3\. And these are illegal (as judges or witnesses), one who played at
cards, or lent on usury, or bet on the flight of doves, or trades in the
Sabbatical year. R. Simon said, "at first they were called gatherers on
the Sabbatical year; when they were forced by Gentiles to cultivate the
ground, they changed to call them traders on the Sabbatical year." R.
Judah said, "it is only when they have no other occupation but this one
alone: but if they have another occupation, they are allowed."

4\. And these are related, his father and his brother, and the brethren
of his father, and the brethren of his mother, and the husband of his
sister, and the husband of his father's sister, and the husband of his
mother's sister. And the husband of his mother and his father-in-law,
and his brother-in-law, they, their children, and their sons-in-law, and
his step-son alone. R. José said, "this was the teaching of R. Akiba;
but the first teaching was, his uncle and the son of his uncle, and all
suitable for inheritance, and every one related to him at the present
time." "One was related and became estranged?" "He is lawful." R. Judah
said, "even if his daughter died, and he has children left by her, they
are related."

5\. "Who is a friend? and who is an enemy?" "A friend is the
bridegroom's best man, an enemy is every one who has not spoken with him
three days in malice." The Sages replied to him, "Israelites are not so
suspicious."

6\. "How are witnesses examined?" "They are brought

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

in and intimidated; and all other men are driven out. And the chief of
the witnesses is left, and they say to him, "tell us how do you know
that this man is indebted to that man?" If the witness said, "he told me
that I am indebted to him"—"such a man told me that he is indebted to
him,"—he has said nothing, till he shall say, "he acknowledged in our
presence that he owed him two hundred zuz." And afterwards the second
witness is brought in, and examined. If their statements were found
agreeing, the judges held a conversation. Two of them said "he is
clear," and one said "he is indebted?" "He is cleared." "Two said, he is
indebted, and one said, he is clear?" "He is indebted." "One said he is
clear, and one said he is indebted? And even if two pronounced him clear
or indebted, and one said, 'I don't know?'" "The judges must be
increased."

7\. The matter is finished. They bring in the plaintiff and defendant.
The chief judge says, "thou, such a one, art clear; thou such an one,
art indebted." "And whence know we that one of the judges on going out
should not say, 'I was for clearing him, but my colleagues pronounced
him indebted, but what shall I do when my colleagues are too many for
me?'" "Of this man it is said, 'Thou shalt not go up and down as a
tale-bearer among thy people;' <span id="fr_387"></span>[1](#fn_381.md) and
it is said, 'A talebearer revealeth secrets.'" <span
id="fr_388"></span>[2](#fn_382.md)

8\. At any time the one condemned may bring evidence and annul the
judgment. The judges said to him, "bring all your evidence within thirty
days from this date." If he brought them within thirty days, it is
annulled, if after thirty days, it is not annulled. Rabban Simon the son
of Gamaliel said, "what shall he do if he did not find them within
thirty days, but found them after thirty days?" "The judges said to him,
'bring witnesses;' and he said, 'I have no witnesses:' they said, 'bring
evidence;' and he said, I have no evidence:' but afterwards he found
evidence, and found witnesses?" "They are nothing." Rabban Simon the son
of Gamaliel said, "what shall he do if he did not know

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

that he had witnesses, and found witnesses; he did not know that he had
evidence, and found evidence?" "They said to him, 'bring witnesses;' he
said, 'I have no witnesses.' 'Bring evidence,' and he said, 'I have no
evidence.'" "He saw that he will be pronounced indebted in judgment,"
and he said, "approach such an one, and such an one, and bear witness
for me," or "he pulled out evidence from his pocket?" "It is nothing."
