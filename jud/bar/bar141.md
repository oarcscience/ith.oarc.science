### CHAPTER V.

The court of the tabernacle was in length one hundred cubits, and in
breadth fifty cubits, as is said, "And thou shalt make the court of the
tabernacle for the south side, etc., an hundred cubits, <span
id="fr_730"></span>[2](#fn_723) and likewise for the north side an
hundred cubits," as is said, "And likewise for the north side in length
there shall be hangings of an hundred cubits long." <span
id="fr_731"></span>[3](#fn_724) And on the west fifty cubits, as is
said, "On the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits." <span
id="fr_732"></span>[4](#fn_725) And on the east fifty cubits, as is
said, "On the east side eastward *shall be* fifty cubits." <span
id="fr_733"></span>[5](#fn_726) Take front them fifty cubits for
hangings, as is said, "The hangings of one side of the gate shall be
fifteen cubits," <span id="fr_734"></span>[6](#fn_727) etc. "And for the
other side," etc. From both sides the hangings on the south to the tent
were twenty cubits, and the tent

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

was ten cubits broad, and from the tent to the hangings on the north
were twenty cubits. This teaches that the breadth (of the court) was
fifty cubits. From the hangings on the west to the tent were twenty
cubits, and the tent was thirty cubits long; and from the tent to the
hangings on the east, there were fifty cubits. This teaches that its
length was an hundred cubits, as is said, "The length of the court shall
be an hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty everywhere." <span
id="fr_735"></span>[1](#fn_728) Rabbi José said there is no meaning in
saying "fifty everywhere," and what is meant by saying "fifty
everywhere?" "That is in front of the tent." This teaches that its
length was one hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits. But you
could not know the breadth of the hangings till you know the height of
the court, as he (Moses) said, "And the height five cubits;" <span
id="fr_736"></span>[1](#fn_728) as the height was five cubits, so was
the breadth five cubits. "How was the court set up?" Twenty sockets of
brass were put on the north side, and twenty on the south side, and
there was a pillar in every one of them. And there were beams, and a
ring was fastened in their middle, and the beams were fastened with
ropes and pillars; and the length of every beam was six handbreadths,
and its breadth was three (handbreadths). And the ring was hung on the
hook in the pillar; and the hanging was rolled on it like the sail of a
ship. It follows that the hanging extended from the pillar two cubits
and a half on one side, and two cubits and a half on the other side; and
so with the second pillar. This teaches that between each pillar there
were five cubits. The beams were coupled with ropes and pillars, and
they were coupled in the pins of brass; and as there were pins to the
tabernacle, so were there pins to the court, as is said, "All the
vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins
thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass." <span
id="fr_737"></span>[2](#fn_729) But you could not know how much space
there was front the hangings to the entrance of the court, till he said,
"And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate
of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar." <span
id="fr_738"></span>[3](#fn_730) As between the tabernacle

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

and the altar there were ten cubits, so from the hangings to the
entrance of the court there were ten cubits. But you could not know how
high was the entrance of the court, till he said, "And for the gate of
the court shall be an hanging of twenty cubits," in length and height.
In breadth it was five cubits. "There was no meaning in saying five
cubits, and what is the meaning of saying five cubits?" "To instruct
thee that its length was ten cubits, and its breadth five cubits." As
was the entrance of the tent, so was the entrance of the court. As was
the entrance of the court, so was the entrance of the sanctuary. As was
the height of the entrance of the sanctuary, so was the breadth of the
entrance of the porch. "The length of the court shall be an hundred
cubits, and the breadth of it fifty everywhere." <span
id="fr_739"></span>[1](#fn_731) The oral law says, "Take fifty and
surround them with fifty." <span id="fr_740"></span>[2](#fn_732) Hence
said Rabbi José, the son of Rabbi Judah, <span
id="fr_741"></span>[3](#fn_733) "an enclosed space which can contain two
seahs (of sown grain) as the court of the tabernacle, is lawful for
carrying burdens on the Sabbath day."
