### Part III

*Pupil:* It seems quite necessary to prove and demonstrate by necessary
and universal proofs that the forms that are in the substance that
supports the categories are the object of the action of the simple
substance and stem from them.

*Master:* Your request is a good one: it is in fact very necessary. Here
are the proofs that demonstrate that the forms borne by the corporeal
substance are the object of the action of the simple and spiritual
substances and that they stem from them.

The action of every simple substance is simple. Now the actions that are
in the substance that supports the categories are simple. Therefore the
actions that are in the substance that supports the categories are the
object of the action of the simple substance.

The energies, the forms, and the motions that are in the corporeal
substance are more simple and more subtle than the corporeal substance.
Now all that is more simple and more subtle than the corporeal substance
submits to the domain of the simple substance. Therefore the energies,
the forms, and the motions that are in the corporeal substance submit to
the domain of the simple substance.

Next, I add to this conclusion the following proposition: All that is in
the nature of the simple substance must be either of the essence of the
simple substance

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

or one of its accidents. Therefore the energies, the forms, and the
motions that are in the corporeal substance are either of the essence of
the simple substance or of the number of accidents. But they are not of
the essence of the simple substance because they are not substances.
Therefore they are of the number of its accidents.

The compound substance receives the forms. Now all that receives the
forms receives them from the agent that produces them in it. Therefore
the compound substance receives the forms of the agent that produces
them in it. Then I add to this conclusion this proposition: The simple
substance acts upon the compound substance. Therefore the compound
substance receives the forms of the simple substance.

When a thing receives something from another thing, the thing received
in that which receives is the object of the action of that which gives.
Therefore the forms that the compound substance receives are the object
of the action of the simple substance. Now everything that in a thing is
the object of the action of another thing exists in the causative agent.
Therefore the forms that the compound substance receives exist in the
causative agent. Now the causative agent is the simple substance.
Therefore the forms that the compound substance receives exist in the
simple substance.

The forms that are borne by the corporeal substance are actions. Now
every action comes from that which acts on the forms that are borne.
Therefore the forms that are borne by the corporeal substance do not
come from the substance that supports the categories. Similarly I add to
this conclusion the following proposition: Everything that does not come
from something comes from its contrary. Therefore the form that is

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

borne by the corporeal substance comes from its contrary. Next, I add to
this proposition: The simple substance is opposed to the compound
substance. Therefore the forms borne by the corporeal substance come
from the simple substance.

If the compound substance does not take from the simple substance the
motions, energies, and figures, the simple substance either does not
exist, or does not act. But the simple substance exists and acts.
Therefore the compound substance takes from the simple substance the
figures, energies, and motions.

The figures, energies, and motions that are in the compound substance
are received necessarily either from the First Author, or from the
essence of the substance that possesses them, or from another substance
intermediary between them.

If they were received from the essence of the First Author, it would
necessarily follow that the First Author and the substance that supports
the categories had something in common, for that which is in the essence
of the First Author would be united with the essence of the substance.
Furthermore, it would be necessary that there should be multiplicity in
the essence of the First Author on account of the multiplicity of the
figures, energies, and motions. Now both hypotheses are impossible.
Therefore the figures, energies, and motions that are in the substance
that supports the categories are not received from the essence of the
First Author.

If they were received from the essence of the substance that possesses
them, it would be necessary that the substance should at the same time
cause the form and receive it, and it would be necessary that it should
act in so far as it receives or that it should not act in so far as it
receives. If it acted in so far as it received, one and the same thing
would act and

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

be the object of the action at the same time: which is impossible. If it
did not act in so far as it receives, the whole would not receive the
form. But it is a substance entirely formed. Therefore it is impossible
that it should not act in so far as it is the object of action. If the
substance does not act in so far as it is the object of action, and if
the agent is stronger than the object of the action, it is necessary, if
the substance is one, that the substance be in one way stronger than
itself and in another way weaker than itself. If it is not one, and if
it acts partly and is partly passive, it is necessary that the passive
part should be without form. But the substance in its entirety is
formed. It is therefore formed and not formed: which is inadmissible.

In anything composed of two things, each of them can exist by itself.
Now the body is composed of substance and form. Therefore the form can
exist by itself without the corporeal substance. Similarly I assert: The
form can exist by itself without the corporeal substance. Now the form
does not exist without a support. Therefore the form is in a support
that is not the corporeal substance. Next I add to this proposition:
Apart from the corporeal substance, there is no other support except the
simple substance. Therefore the form exists in the simple substance.

Every action takes place in the spiritual and every reception in the
corporeal. Now if the substance acted in so far as being an object of
the action, it would be spiritual and corporeal at the same time. And if
it acted partly and was partly the object of the action, it would be
partly spiritual and partly corporeal. But the substance that supports
the categories in its entirety is corporeal. Therefore there is nothing
in it that acts.

If the corporeal substance receives the forms, that

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

are supported in it, from another substance different from itself, it is
necessary that this substance should be superior to it. Now the simple
substance is superior to the compound substance. Therefore the corporeal
substance receives the forms that it has from the simple substance.

The simple substances are perceived only in bodies. Now the forms that
are in the compound substance are perceived in bodies. Therefore the
forms that are in the compound substance come from the forms of the
simple substances.

The form that is perceived by the senses in the compound substance
fulfils its being. Now all that fulfils the being of a substance is a
substance. Therefore the form that is perceived by the senses in the
compound substance is a substance.

The simple substance is divided into matter and form, according to the
division of genus into species. Now whenever a thing is divided as the
genus is divided into species, the species of this thing receive equally
the name and the definition of the genus. Therefore the species of the
simple substance receive equally the name and the definition of the
genus. To this proposition I add the following one: Matter and form are
species of the simple substance. Therefore matter and form receive
equally the name and the definition of the simple substance. Now the
simple substance receives the name and the definition of the substance.
Therefore matter and form receive equally the name and the definition of
the substance.

Every effect is composed in relation to its cause. And if the corporeal
forms are the effects of spiritual forms, it is necessary that they
should be compound. Now they are compound. Therefore they are the
effects of spiritual forms.

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

Whatever was caused is in act in itself, and is in potentiality in the
cause. If the forms of the compound substance are effects, it is
necessary that they should be in themselves in act and in potentiality
in their cause. Now they are effects in act. They are therefore in
potentiality in their cause.

The corporeal forms diffused in the substance are united with them. Now
a thing, once it is united, has not the same virtue and the same
perfection as the simple form by itself. Therefore the form that is
diffused in the substance has not a virtue and a perfection so great as
the simple form by itself.

Next I take this proposition and I assert: Everything that is not so
good as a thing in virtue and perfection is similar to it. Therefore the
form diffused in the substance is similar to the simple form by itself.

Then I take this proposition and I add: Everything that is similar to a
thing is its reproduction. Therefore the forms diffused in the substance
are the reproduction of spiritual forms. Then I add to this proposition:
Everything that is the reproduction of a thing is its image or its
portrait. Therefore the form that is diffused in the substance is the
image or the portrait of the spiritual form.

The forms are simple. Now the simple is anterior to the compound.
Therefore the forms are anterior to that which is composed of them.

Every form possessed by matter differs in clarity and in perfection
according to the clarity and the perfection of the matter that receives
it. Now whenever a thing differs from another thing, the quality of its
form depends on the thing from which it differs. Therefore the spiritual
form that the matter has depends on the matter from which it differs.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

To this proposition I add the following one: Whenever the form of a
thing depends on another thing, this form is not a form by itself.
Therefore the spiritual form that the matter has is not a form by
itself.

Then, after this, I assert: Everything that is not in something by
itself is the object of the action of a thing that is in something by
itself. Therefore the form that the matter has is the object of the
action of a thing that is in another thing a form by itself.

Every spiritual substance has a form and every spiritual substance is
subtle. Now the form of every subtle thing emanates from this thing.
Therefore the form of the spiritual substance emanates from this
substance. Then, after this, I assert: The form of the spiritual
substance emanates from this substance. Now whenever the form of a thing
emanates from this thing, this form is reflected by the contrary thing
that receives it. Therefore the form of the spiritual substance is
reflected by the contrary thing that receives it.

To this conclusion I add: Now every form reflected by the contrary thing
that receives it penetrates the thing that receives it and envelops it,
if its substance is a subtle substance. Therefore the form of the
spiritual substance penetrates and envelops the substance with
categories. To this proposition I add next: The form of the spiritual
substance penetrates and envelops the substance supporting the
categories. Now the form borne by the substance supporting the
categories penetrates and envelops this substance. Therefore the form
borne by the substance supporting the categories is the form itself of
the spiritual substance.

Every corporeal substance has a limited essence. Now everything that has
a limited essence cannot extend in every place. Therefore the essence of
the corporeal substance cannot extend in every place.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Then, inversely:
The spiritual substance has an unlimited essence because it is neither
quantitative nor finite. Now when a thing has an unlimited essence, the
essence extends and exists in every place. Therefore the essence of the
spiritual substance extends and exists in every place.

Next, I take this conclusion as a premise and I assert: Now everything
that extends, flows and does not remain motionless. Therefore the
spiritual substance flows and does not remain motionless. Then I assert:
The spiritual substance flows and does not remain motionless. Now
whenever a thing flows aril does not remain motionless, the form ceases
when it meets a body that obstructs it and that reflects the form and
the action of this thing: as the light of the sun, that is reflected by
the body. Therefore the form of the spiritual substance ceases and is
reflected by the body. Then I add this proposition: The form borne by
the corporeal substance ceases in it and is reflected by it. Therefore
the form borne by the corporeal substance is the form itself that
proceeds from the spiritual substance.

Everything that is reflected from one thing in another has the property
of extending on the surface of the thing where it is reflected and of
enveloping it to the point of invisibility. Now the form borne by the
compound substance extends on the surface of the substance and envelops
it to the point of invisibility. Therefore the form borne by the
compound substance is the reflection in it of a substance other than it.
Then I add to this proposition: Everything that is in a thing the
reflection of a thing other than itself exists in that of which it is
the reflection. Therefore the form borne by the compound substance
exists in the substance of which it is the reflection.

All the designs and the figures that appear in the

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

compound substance are impressed therein by its cause. Now the simple
substance is the cause of the compound substance. Therefore all the
designs and the figures that appear in the compound substance are
impressed therein by the simple substance. Then to this proposition I
add the following one: All that is impressed by one thing in another
thing exists in the thing that impresses it. Therefore all the designs
and the figures that appear in the compound substance exist in that
which impresses them. Then I add this proposition: The simple substance
impresses the designs and the figures. Therefore all the designs and the
figures that appear in the compound substance exist in the simple
substance.

The figures, the colors, and the designs that appear in the particular
compounds come from an active substance. The substance that has the form
of the elements is not active. Therefore the figures, the colors, and
the designs that appear in the particular compounds do not come from the
substance that has the form of the elements. They come therefore from
some simple substance. These actions come from the essence of the simple
substance or they do not. If they do not come from its essence, it is
possible that they do not come from its action. But it is impossible
that they do not come from its action. Therefore it is impossible that
they do not come from its essence. And if they come from its essence, it
is necessary that they should be in its essence. The same assertion must
be made in regard to the universal figures and designs that appear in
the compound substance, namely that they exist in the essence of the
substance that impresses them.

One is the root of the multiple. The simple substance is one. Therefore
the simple substance is the

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

root of the multiple. The forms that are borne by the compound substance
are a multitude. Therefore the simple substance is the root of the forms
that are borne by the compound substances.

The multiple is an aggregate of units: the units in the aggregate are
divided into units as the whole is divided into parts. And whenever a
thing is divided into another, the nature of the whole exists in each of
its parts. Now the units are parts of the multiple. Therefore the nature
of the multiple exists in each of the units.

Now the forms that are borne by the compound substance are a multitude.
Therefore the forms that are in the compound substance exist in a single
form. But the form of the simple substance is one. Therefore the forms
that are in the compound substance exist in the form of the simple
substance.

The simple substance resembles unity more than the compound substance
does. Now the form that is in the compound substance resembles unity
more than the compound substance does. Therefore the simple substance
resembles the form that is in the compound substance, since both
substances resemble unity more.

Now all similar things are so in genus, species, accident, or quality.
But the form is not of the same genus or of the same species as the
simple substance, and the simple substance has no accident in its
essence. Therefore their similarity does not come from that source. They
are therefore similar in relation to the action.

Quantity and quality are two forms. Now every form comes from form.
Therefore quantity and quality do not come from the substance that
possesses them. Similarly, quantity and quality come from form. Now,
apart from the compound substance and the

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

simple substance, there is no form. Therefore quantity and quality come
from the simple substance.

Quantity is multitude. Now multitude is composed of units. Therefore
quantity is composed of units. Now units are composed of simple unity.
Therefore quantity is composed of simple unity. Now simple unity is in
the simple substance. Therefore quantity is composed of the unity of the
simple substance. The unity in the simple substance is a simple
accident. Now the compound accident is composed of the simple accident.
Therefore the compound accident is composed of the unity of the simple
substance.

Similarly: Quantity is composed of units. Now compound units are a
compound accident. Therefore quantity is a compound accident. To this
proposition I add the following one: The compound accident is composed
of the unit of the simple substance. Therefore quantity is composed of
the unit of the simple substance.

I assert that the properties and the impressions of the simple substance
exist in the form that is borne by the compound substance. And here is
the proof.

The simple substance is perceived by the senses in the body. Similarly,
form is perceived by the senses in the body. A simple substance is one
simple being in itself. Similarly, form is a simple unit in itself. The
simple substance is a form for the compound substance. Similarly, form
is a form for the compound substance. The simple substance completes
that of which it is the form. Similarly, the form completes that of
which it is the form. The simple substance penetrates the compound
substance. Similarly, the form penetrates the compound substance. The
simple substance envelops the compound substance.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Similarly with the
form. The simple substance distinguishes its subject from another
subject. Similarly the form distinguishes the compound substance from
another substance. The simple substance gathers together the parts of
its subject. Similarly the form gathers together the compound substance.
The simple substance is not in place. Similarly with the form. The
simple substance is mobile and active. Similarly with the form.

Next, I take this proposition as a premise and I assert that the
properties and the impressions of the simple substance exist in the form
that is borne by the compound substance. Now wherever the properties of
the simple substance exist, this impression is due to the simple
substance. Therefore the form that is in the compound substance is
impressed by the simple substance.

Similarly, in another way. If the properties and the impressions of the
simple substance are in the form that is borne by the compound
substance, it is necessary that the form that is borne by the compound
substance should impress the properties in the same way as the simple
substance does. Similarly, we shall prepare propositions about each
property of a simple substance and about the properties of form, and we
shall add a proof that concludes that the form comes from the impression
of the simple substance. The number of these proofs will depend
therefore on the number of the properties from which the propositions
arise.

When two substances of contrary form unite, there springs from their
union a form different from the proper forms of these substances. The
truth of this proposition is evident to the senses: but to the
intelligence it will appear in the following manner.

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

I assert that the forms of two united substances are two. The nature of
the two differs from the nature of the one. Therefore the nature of the
two forms of the two united substances differs from the nature of each
of them. Similarly, in another way. Whenever two contrary things unite,
they become some kind of one. Now the two differ from the one. Therefore
whenever two things unite they become something other than one of them.
Next I add to this conclusion the following proposition: Two forms
unite. Therefore when two forms unite, they become something other than
each of them. Similarly in another way. The form that springs from the
union of two forms must be either one of them or neither the one nor the
other. Now it is impossible that it should be one of them because it is
impossible that the form should perish. Therefore it is a form that
differs from each of them and it is not one of them.

Since the proposition is true that declares that from the union of two
substances contrary in form there arises a form that differs from the
form of each of them, let us verify the proposition that declares that
the simple substance unites with the compound substance. The truth of
this proposition is evident to the senses, for we see the impressions of
nature and of the soul in the substance that they compose: thus the
union and the conjunction of these substances are verified. As for the
proof for the intelligence, that is demonstrated in the following
manner.

The simple substance is of the same genus as the compound substance. Now
everything that is of the same genus unites. Therefore the simple
substance and the compound substance unite. Similarly with another
method of reasoning. The simple substance acts. Now every agent unites
with the thing that receives its action. Therefore every simple
substance

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

unites with the thing that receives its action. Then I take this
proposition as a premise and I add: Now the compound substance receives
the action of the simple substance. Therefore every simple substance
unites with the compound substance. Similarly with another method of
reasoning. The form of the simple substance emanates necessarily. Now
all that emanates necessarily unites with the thing that is before it.
Therefore the form of the simple substance unites with the thing that is
before it. I take this proposition as a premise and I add the following
one: The compound substance is opposite the simple substance. Therefore
the form of the simple substance unites with the compound substance.
Similarly with another method of reasoning. The simple substance
contains the compound substance. Now everything that contains another
thing is united with that which it contains. Therefore the simple
substance is united with the compound substance. Similarly with another
method of reasoning. The simple substance is of unlimited essence. Now
whenever a thing is of unlimited essence, its essence is extended.
Therefore the essence of the simple substance is extended. And to this
conclusion I add: Whenever the essence of a thing is extended, this
essence is everywhere. Therefore the essence of the simple substance is
everywhere. Now everything whose essence is everywhere is united with
everything that the place comprehends. Therefore the essence of the
simple substance is united with everything that the place comprehends.
Now the compound substance is everything that the place comprehends.
Therefore the essence of the simple substance is united with the essence
of the compound substance. Similarly with another method of reasoning.
The simple substance wants that which it has in potentiality to pass
into act. Whenever a thing wants that which

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

it has in potentiality to pass into act, its effect appears in a
subject. Therefore the effect of the simple substance appears in a
subject. Now whenever the effect of a thing appears in a subject, this
thing unites with this subject. Therefore the simple substance unites
with the subject of its action. But the compound substance is the
subject of its action. Therefore the simple substance unites with the
compound substance.

And since the proposition that asserts that the simple substance and the
compound substance are united is certain, I take it as a premise and I
add to it this proposition: Whenever two things unite, there springs
from their union a form that differs from the form of each of them. This
is the proposition that we have previously verified. Therefore from the
union of the simple substance and the compound substance there springs a
form that differs from the form of each of them. Then I add to this
proposition the following one: The figures, energies, and motions that
are in the compound substance are forms that differ from the form of the
essence of the simple substance and from the form of the essence of the
compound substance, as it was previously. Therefore from the union of
the simple substance and the compound substance there spring the
figures, energies, and motions that are in the compound substance.

The forms that are in the compound substance pass into action and are
perceived by the senses. Now whenever a simple substance unites with the
compound substance, the forms that the intelligence seized in it pass
from potentiality into act and are perceived by the senses. Therefore
the forms that are in the compound substance pass into act and are
perceived by the senses when the simple substance unites with the
compound substance.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

Every corporeal substance is sensible. Now all the impressions that are
in a sensible thing are sensible. Therefore all the impressions that are
in a corporeal substance are sensible.

Similarly: The impressions of the simple substance are in the corporeal
substance. Now all the impressions that are in the corporeal substance
are sensible. Therefore all the impressions of the simple substance in
the compound substance are sensible. Then I convert this proposition and
I obtain the following one: All that is sensible in the corporeal
substance is the impression of the simple substance.

All the forms that are in the corporeal substance are sensible. Now all
that is sensible in the corporeal substance is the impression of the
simple substance. Therefore all the forms that are in the compound
substance are the impressions of the simple substance.

The compound substance is an effect. Now all the forms that appear in an
effect are impressed therein by its cause. Therefore all the forms and
the impressions that appear in the compound substance are impressed
therein by its cause. The simple substance is the cause of the compound
substance. Therefore all the forms and the impressions that appear in
the compound substance are impressed therein by the simple substance.

The form of every effect is in the cause of this effect. Now the simple
substances are the causes of the compound substances. Therefore the
forms of the compound substances are in the simple substances.

The simple substance is the active cause of the compound substance. Now
all that is an active cause for a thing impresses in it that which is in
its essence. Therefore the simple substance impresses in the compound
substance that which is in its essence. Then I

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

take this proposition as a premise and I assert: The simple substance
impresses in the compound substance that which is in its essence. Now
the simple substance impresses in the compound substance the figures,
energies, and motions. Therefore the figures, energies, and motions are
in the simple substance.

Motion is an impression of the soul. Now motion is in the compound
substance. Therefore the impression of the soul is in the compound
substance.

The imperfect is created by the perfect. Now the imperfect compound
substance comes from the simple substance. Therefore the compound
substance is created by the simple substance.

The soul moves. Now the mobile is the cause of that which is at rest.
Therefore the soul is the cause of that which is at rest. The compound
substance is at rest. Therefore the soul is the cause of the compound
substance. The compound substance and the forms that are borne by it are
together. Therefore the soul is the cause at the same time of the
compound substance and of the form that subsists in it.

Every corporeal substance is receptive only and compound only, while the
spiritual substance is receptive and active, simple in one sense and
compound in another sense. Now that which is active and receptive,
simple and compound, receives numerous forms. And if a thing receives
numerous forms, these numerous forms are in it potentially. There are
therefore in the simple substance numerous forms in potentiality. Now
all that in which there are numerous forms in potentiality causes these
forms to pass from potentiality into act. Therefore the simple substance
causes the forms that are in it in potentiality to pass into act.

It is therefore necessary that every cause should impress the figures
and its forms in its effect. Now

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

that which receives an impression never equals in force and perfection
that which gives it. It is therefore necessary that the cause should be
equipped with more figures and forms than its effect. Now the simple
substance is the cause of the compound substance. It is therefore
necessary that the simple substance should be equipped with more figures
and forms than the compound substance. Similarly in another way. The
compound substance is the effect of the simple substance. Now the effect
is equipped with fewer figures and forms than its cause. Therefore the
compound substance is equipped with fewer figures and forms than the
simple substance. Similarly in another way. If the simple substance had
only a single figure and a single form, its effect would be equipped
with more forms and more figures. But the effect is not equipped with
more forms and figures than the cause. Therefore the simple substance
has one figure only and one form only.
