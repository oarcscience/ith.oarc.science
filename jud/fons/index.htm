Solomon ibn Gabirol, also known as Avicebron,
was a Spanish-Jewish poet and philosopher of the eleventh century.
This is a translation of a key extract from his major philosophical work,
the <CITE>Fons Vitae</CITE>, or <CITE>Fountain of Life</CITE>.
In this text, Gabirol uses a Socratic dialog as a framework to discuss
his theory of the 'First Cause.'
Written in Arabic, the <CITE>Fons</CITE> was translated into Latin
in the 12th century,
The work was attributed to 'Avicebron,' who was not identified
as Jewish but as Christian or possibly Muslim.
One reason is that Gabirol does not reference the Tanakh or
Talmud, as would be normal for a Jewish intellectual
from this time and place.
In addition, his neo-Platonic views seem to place him in a more
Christian intellectual current.
However, in 1846, a scholar named Solomon Munk announced that he
had discovered that Avicebron was the same person as Gabirol.
