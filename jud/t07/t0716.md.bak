### CHAPTER VI.

RULES AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE SALE OF SEEDS WHICH BECOME SPOILED,
THE QUANTITY OF DUST WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE ACCEPTED IN THE MEASURES OF
GRAIN AND FRUIT, AND WINE WHICH BECOMES SOUR AFTER SALE BEFORE
DELIVERY.--CONCERNING CONTRACTORS FOR HOUSES AND STABLES, WELLS AND
GARDENS SITUATED IN NEIGHBORS' PROPERTIES OR PUBLIC THOROUGHFARES IN
PRIVATE GROUND, AND CONCERNING GRAVES AND CAVES FOR BURYING.

MISHNA *I*.: If one sold fruit or grain (without any stipulation), and
the buyer sowed it but it did not sprout, even if this were seed of
flax, the seller is not responsible. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel, however,
maintains that if he sold seeds for gardens, which could not be used for
eating, the seller is responsible.

GEMARA: It was taught: If one sold an ox, and thereafter it was found it
was a goring one, the sale is void according to Rabh. Samuel, however,
said: The seller may say: "I sold it to you for slaughtering." Let us
see: If the buyer was one of those that buy for slaughtering (*e.g.*, a
butcher), why then should the sale be void according to Rabh? And if he
was one who buys for working purposes (*e.g.*, a farmer), why should the
sale be valid according to Samuel? It treats of one who buys for both
purposes (*e.g.*, if he was both a farmer and a butcher). But even then,
let us see the amount he paid for it, from which we can judge whether he
bought for slaughtering or for work. It treats of where the meat has
increased in price to the extent of the value of an ox for working. If
so, what is the difference (the buyer gets the full value for his

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

money in any case,)? The difference is, if the trouble of slaughtering
and selling the meat should be taken into consideration (according to
Rabh it should, and therefore the sale is void; and according to Samuel
it should not). Again, let us see how was the case. If the seller has no
cash to return, why, according to Rabh, should the sale be void, so that
the buyer has to return the ox? Let him keep the ox for his money; as
people say: "If you keep something in hand belonging to your debtor,
even if it is bran, take the trouble to make money by it." It means when
the seller is not lacking in cash. According to Rabh, the sale is void
because the majority must always be taken into consideration, and the
majority of cattle-buyers are traders; and Samuel maintains that only in
prohibitory laws the majority is to be taken into consideration, but not
in money matters.

Come and hear an objection from the following (First Gate, V., Mishna
I.): "Should an ox gore a cow and the new-born calf be found dead at her
side, and it be not known," etc. (see there, end of the Mishna, p. 106).
Now, according to the theory of our Mishna, the decision of the cited
Mishna would not be correct, as the majority of cattle should be taken
into consideration, which conceive and bring forth living offspring.
Hence the dead one found at her side is dead because of the goring. Why,
then, is it considered doubtful there? The doubt was, if the ox gored
the cow in front, so that the premature birth took place because of
terror before goring, or if the cow was gored in the back, and the
premature birth was occasioned by the goring, and therefore the extent
of the injury is considered doubtful. And there is a rule that such be
divided.

Shall we assume that the point of difference between Rabh and Samuel is
the same as that in which the Tanaim of the following Boraitha differ?
"If an ox was pasturing and another one was found killed at his side,
although investigation shows that the death occurred from goring, and
the pasturing ox was vicious in goring, or the death occurred from
biting, and the pasturing ox was vicious in biting, it is still
uncertain that this ox has gored or bitten the other." R. Aha, however,
said: If there was found a camel killed at the side of a biting camel,
although the latter was not yet vicious, it must be taken

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

for a certainty that he killed the other. The schoolmen thought majority
and hazakah <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61.md) identical; for as a
goring or a biting animal has a hazakah to gore, bite, and kill, it is
to be taken for a certainty that the gored or bitten one found at his
side was killed by him, and the same is the case with the majority.

Is it not to assume that Rabh holds with R. Aha, and Samuel with the
first Tana?

Nay! Rabh may say: My decision is correct, even in accordance with the
first Tana of the cited Boraitha, as the reason of his decision is not
majority, but hazakah"--*i.e.*, there was not a majority of vicious
oxen, but one, which had a habit (hazakah) of goring or biting, as
hazakah and majority are not identical; but if there should be a
majority, it would be taken into consideration. And, also, Samuel may
say: My decision is correct, even in accordance with R. Aha, as his
reason is the habit (hazakah) of that animal which was found near, and a
majority would not be taken into consideration.

Come and hear an objection from our Mishna, which states that the seller
is not responsible, even for seeds of flax. Does not the term "even"
mean, although the majority is for sowing, and nevertheless it is not
taken into consideration? Hence it opposes Rabh? In this point the
Tanaim of the following Boraitha differ: "If one sold fruit, and the
buyer has sown it but it did not sprout, if it was garden seed, which
could not be used for eating, he is responsible; but if it was seed of
flax, he is not." R. Jose, however, said that the seller has to return
to the buyer the value of the seed, as the majority buy it for sowing
only. The sages, however, answered him: There are many who buy it for
other purposes.

But who of the Tanaim in this Boraitha hold not the theory of majority?
Shall we assume that it means R. Jose; and the sages answered *him* that
there are many people who buy seeds, etc.? Then all of them hold the
theory of majority, but one takes into consideration the majority of the
seed (*i.e.*, the majority of seed which is bought for sowing, and the
other the majority of men)? Therefore we must say that it means, the
difference of opinion between the first Tana and R. Jose, or the
difference of opinion between the first Tana and the sages,

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

who answered *him* (*i.e.*, the statement in the Boraitha, "and they
said to him," means the first Tana, not R. Jose).

The rabbis taught: "The seller has to return to the buyer the value of
the seed, but not the expenses for ploughing, sowing, etc.; according to
others, however, the expenses also." Who are the others? Said R. Hisda:
R. Simeon b. Gamaliel. Which R. Simeon b. Gamaliel? Shall we assume from
our Mishna, which states that for seeds which could not be used for
eating, he is responsible, and from the first Tana's statement, that the
seller is not responsible for seeds of flax, that it is to be inferred
for seeds of flax only, but for other seeds which cannot be used for
eating, the Tana is also of the opinion that the seller is responsible?
Then they do not differ at all. Therefore it must be said that they
differ in the expenses, the first Tana holding the seller must return
the value of the seeds only, and R. Simeon all the expenses also (and so
R. Hisda means R. Simeon of our Mishna). But perhaps the reverse is the
case--R. Simeon holds the value of the seeds only, while the first Tana
holds the expenses also? This presents no difficulty; for as usual the
second Tana adds something. But perhaps the entire Mishna is in
[accordance](errata.htm#15.md)with R. Simeon and is not complete, but
should read thus: If one sells fruits and they were sown and did not
sprout, even if they were seeds of flax, he is not responsible. Such is
the decree of R. Simeon b. Gamaliel, who holds that only for garden
seeds that cannot be used for eating the seller is responsible.
Therefore we must say that R. Hisda means R. Simeon b. Gamaliel of the
following Boraitha: "If one delivered wheat for grinding of fine meal,
but the miller did not properly grind it, but made it into bruised grain
or bran; or if meal were delivered to a baker and he did not bake it
properly, but when he took it out it fell to pieces; or if an ox were
delivered to a slaughterer, and he made it illegal, each of these
persons is responsible, as they are considered bailees for hire." R.
Simeon b. Gamaliel said, that they not only have to pay the damages, but
also for the shame of the owner in the eyes of the guests who were
invited to the meal, as well as for the shame of the guests themselves;
and so the same R. Simeon used to say: There was a great custom in
Jerusalem, if one ordered a banquet for guests, and the host spoiled it,
he had to pay for his own shame, and for the shame

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

of the guests. There was also another great custom in Jerusalem: "a flag
was put at the door where a banquet was to be given, and the invited
guests had to enter only when the flag was still at the door, but when
it was taken off they were not to enter any more."

MISHNA *II*.: If one buys fruit, he has to accept a quarter' of a kabh
of dust on a saah; of dry figs, he has to accept ten wormy ones in a
hundred; on a cellar of wine, he must accept ten harsh ones on each
hundred; if he sells him earthen jugs made in Sharon he has to accept
ten unglazed ones on each hundred.

GEMARA: R. K'tina taught: By a quarter of a kabh of dust is meant peas,
but not earth proper. Is that so? Did not Rabba b. Hyya Ktuspha'h say in
the name of Rabba: If one has cleaned off little stones from the barn of
his neighbor he has to pay him the value of wheat (*i.e.*, as if they
were there, he may put them in the measure, but to put them
intentionally he is not allowed)? Peas, he has to accept a quarter of a
kabh on a saah, but dust he has also to accept, although a less
quantity. You say less than a quarter of dust, but did not the following
Boraitha state: "If one sells wheat, he has to accept a quarter of a
kabh of peas on a saah; if barley, a quarter of chaff on a saah; and if
lentils, a quarter of dust." Is it not to assume that a quarter of dust
is to be accepted for wheat and barley also? With lentils it is
different, because they are not cut, but torn out from earth, and
therefore usually a great deal of dust remains with them, which is not
the case with wheat and barley; but if it is so, infer from this that
for wheat and barley no dust must be accepted at all, while it is stated
above that less than a kabh is to be accepted? Nay, from the statement
that for lentils he has to accept a quarter nothing is to be inferred;
this being stated, lest one say because there is usually much dust more
than this quantity is to be accepted, it comes to teach us that it is
not so.

R. Huna said: If the buyer has found more than the above prescribed
quantity and sieves it, he may sieve the whole quantity he bought,
without leaving any dust at all, and the seller has to fill the measure
without allowing for the prescribed quantity. According to some it is
the strict law, as usually one gives his money for clean fruit, but if
for a trifle of dust, as

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

much as a quarter of a kabh on a saah, the buyer is not very particular
and does not take the trouble to sieve it; but in our case, when he is
compelled to trouble himself with sieving, he may make the whole fruit
extremely clean; and according to others, it is a fine, as usually no
more than a quarter of a kabh ought to be found in a saah, and when
there was found more, it is presumed that the seller put it in
intentionally, and therefore he is fined by the rabbis.

Come and hear an objection from the following Boraitha: "If a planter
undertakes to plant a field with fruit trees, the owner of it must
accept empty space for ten trees on each hundred, but if, however, it
was found empty for more than this, he has to plant trees on the whole
empty space." Hence is R. Huna's above statement law? Said R. Huna b. R.
Jehoshua: This is not a support to R. Huna, as an empty place for more
than ten trees is to be considered as a separate field, and the planter
who undertook to plant the owner's fields is to be considered as if he
had to begin the planting in this empty field, and therefore he has to
plant the whole field, which case is not similar to that of R. Huna.

"*If he sold a cellar of wine*," etc. Let us see how is the case.
Whether the seller said to the buyer, "I sell you a cellar of wine" or
"this cellar of wine," it is a difficulty from the following Boraitha.
"If he said 'I sell you a cellar of wine,' all of it must be good; if
'*this* cellar of wine,' he must give him wine which is sold in the
retail stores; but if he said, 'I sell you *this* cellar,' even if it
was found to be all vinegar, the sale is valid." Our Mishna speaks of
the case wherein the seller said, "*a* cellar of wine," and there is no
contradiction of the cited Boraitha as it should read, and the buyer has
to accept the ten spoiled ones in the hundred. But has not R. Hyya
taught: If one sells a barrel of wine, he must give the buyer all good
wine? With one barrel it is different, as a barrel contains only one
kind of wine; but has not R. Z'bid in the name of the school of R.
Ossiah taught in "a cellar of wine" all must be good, in "the cellar of
wine" the seller must give the buyer all good wine, but the latter must
accept ten bad in the hundred; and this is the word *Outzar* ("treasure
of wine") which the sages have taught in our Mishna? Therefore it must
be said that our Mishna treats of the case wherein the seller said

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "this cellar," and
the contradiction from the above Boraitha in the case, if "this cellar,"
presents no difficulty, as R. Z'bid says, if the seller told the buyer,
"I sell you wine for keeping," and the Boraitha says the words "for
keeping" were not said, and therefore (the Halakha prevails thus) if the
seller said, "a cellar of wine for keeping," all of it must be good; if
"*this* cellar of wine for keeping," the buyer must accept ten in the
hundred; if "*this* cellar of wine," without the addition "for keeping,"
the seller may give the buyer wine that is sold in retail stores.

The schoolmen propounded a question; How is it if the seller said, "a
cellar of wine," without the addition "for keeping"? On this point R.
Aha and Rabhina differ. According to one the buyer has to accept ten in
the hundred, and according to the other he has not, the one who says "he
must accept" inferring it from R. Z'bid, who states in the case of "a
cellar of wine," all of it must be good, and it was explained above that
he speaks of the case in which the seller added "for keeping," from
which it is to be inferred that if these words were not added, the buyer
must accept; and the other, who says the buyer must not, infers from the
above Boraitha, which states in the case of "a cellar of wine" all of it
must be good; and it was explained above that the Boraitha treats of the
case wherein "for keeping" was not said. But to him who infers from R.
Z'bid, is not the Boraitha contradictory? He may say the Boraitha is not
completed, but should read thus: This is said, if the seller told the
buyer "for keeping," but if not, the buyer must accept, and if the
seller said "this cellar of wine" without any addition, he may give the
buyer wine which is sold in the stores; but to him who infers from the
Boraitha, is not R. Z'bid contradictory who, as explained, said that the
seller told the buyer the wine was "for keeping"? He may say that the
same is the case if the seller did not say "for keeping," and the above
explanation was only in order that the Boraitha and R. Z'bid might not
contradict each other; in reality, however, R. Z'bid does not agree with
the Boraitha.

R. Jehudah said: On wine which is sold in stores the usual benediction
may be made. (The benediction is, "Blessed be Thou the Lord our God King
of the Universe who hast created the products of the vine.") and R.
Jehudah means to say that

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

although the wine in stores is usually bad, it is still called the
product of the vine. R. Hisda, however, said: What have we to do with
such a wine (*i.e.*, how can such wine be called a product of the vine)?

An objection was raised: In the case of moulded bread and sour wine, and
any dish of which the appearance is spoiled, the benediction should be
"That all is created by His words" (hence it contradicts R. Jehudah).
Said R. Z'bid: R. Jehudah admits that over wine made of kernels, which
is usually sold on the corners of streets, the right benediction may be
said. Said Abayi to R. Joseph: "There is R. Jehudah, and there is R.
Hisda, each of them with his opinion; I would like to know how is yours,
master?" And he answered, "I am aware of the following Boraitha: 'If one
examine a barrel of wine for the purpose of separating heave-offering
from it, for all others, and he did so for a month or two, and
thereafter it was found that the wine turned into vinegar, three days is
considered certain, and further on doubtful.' How is this to be
understood? Said R. Johanan thus: The first three days from the
examination it is to be considered certainly wine, and thereafter it is
to be considered doubtful. Why so? Because usually wine becomes sour
from the top, and when he tasted it, it was not sour, and if you say it
had become sour immediately after he tasted it, the smell only was
vinegar-like, but the taste still of wine (as the sages had a tradition
that less than three days from the beginning it becomes not vinegar) and
such is considered wine. R. Jehoshua b. Levi, however, said that all he
separated in the last three days is certainly vinegar, but previous to
that it is doubtful. Why so? Because usually wine begins to turn sour
from the bottom, and maybe when he tasted it it was sour already, of
which he was not aware; and even should I admit that wine begins to turn
sour from the top, my decision is still correct as it may be that it
began to turn sour immediately after being tasted, and I hold that if it
smells of vinegar, though the taste is still of wine, it must be
considered vinegar" (hence according to R. Jehoshua b. Levi the wine
which is sold in stores is not considered wine at all, and according to
R. Johanan it is considered wine).

The sages of the South taught in the name of R. Jehoshua b. Levi thus:
The first three days it should be considered as wine,

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

the last three days as vinegar, and in the days between as doubtful. But
does this statement not contradict itself? The first three days it
certainly is wine, hence if the smell is of vinegar and the taste of
wine, it is considered wine; and thereafter they said, the last three
days it is certainly vinegar, from which it is to be inferred that if
the smell is of vinegar and the taste of wine, it is considered vinegar.
The case was that it was found wholly strong vinegar, and it is stated
above that it takes no less than three days after it turns sour to
become wholly vinegar; hence it is to be supposed that in the last three
days it was already vinegar. However, according to which of these two
was the conclusion of R. Joseph? In this, also, R. Mari and R. Z'bid
differ, one saying that his conclusion was in accordance with R.
Johanan, and the other saying it was in accordance with R. Jehoshua b.
Levi.

It was taught: If one sells a barrel of wine and it turns sour,
according to Rabh the first three days it is considered tinder the
control of the seller, and thereafter "it is considered under the
control of the buyer." Samuel, however, maintains that the seller is not
responsible even when it was still in his barrel, as this is to be
considered the fate of the buyer.

R. Joseph acted in accordance with Rabh concerning beer of dates, and
according to Samuel with wine, the Halakha, according to Samuel,
however, prevails in every respect. <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md)

MISHNA *III*.: If one sells wine and it turns sour, the seller is not
responsible; if, however, it was known that the nature of his wine was
to turn sour (and the buyer was not aware of it), the sale is void. If
he said, "I sell you wine, prepared with spices, in good order," the
wine must remain in good order until the feast of Pentecost. (Afterward
it may become spoiled by heat.) If the seller sold the buyer old wine,
it must be from last year; and if he said "very old," it must be aged
not less than three years.

GEMARA: Said R. Jose b. Hanina: All this is said of the case wherein it
was delivered to the buyer in his own jugs; but if it was placed in the
jugs of the seller, the buyer might say: "Here are your jugs and your
wine." Why then may not

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

the seller claim: You ought not to keep it so long? It means that while
selling, the seller told the buyer "for keeping." But what compels R.
Jose to such a difficult interpretation, in which the jugs were the
buyer's, and the seller says "for keeping"? Why is it not simply said
that the jugs were the seller's and he said nothing? Said Rabha: It is
because the further statement of the Mishna, "that if it was known that
the nature of the seller's wine was to turn sour the sale is void" was a
difficulty to him. Why, then, let the seller claim he ought not to keep
it so long? We must then say, that the Mishna treats of the case wherein
the seller told the buyer "for keeping" (he therefore interpreted the
whole Mishna, that such was the stipulation), and infer from this that
so it is. He, however, differs with R. Hyya b. Joseph, who said that the
fate of one causes the spoiling of his wine; as it is written
\[Habakkuk, ii. 5\]: "And even the wine of a proud man rebels."

Said R. Mari: If one is proud, he is not tolerated even by his family,
as the above verse reads "the proud man whose house will not stand,"
which is to say that he is not tolerated by his household. R. Jehudah in
the name of Rabh said: A commoner who disguises himself in the garment
of a scholar, cannot enter into the habitation of the Holy One, blessed
be He; and this is deduced from an analogy of expression, *Nvie*, which
is to be found in Ex. xv. 13. The Hebrew expression in the above cited
verse is also *Y'nvie* (literally, "dwelling," "inhabit").

Rabha said: "If one sells a barrel of wine to a storekeeper (with the
stipulation that he shall sell it at retail and then pay the owner), and
a half or a third of the wine turns sour, the law is that the seller
must accept the return of his wine; and this is said only in case the
faucet was not changed by the storekeeper, but if it was changed and
placed near to yeast, there is no responsibility, and there is also no
responsibility if the storekeeper kept the wine over the market day." He
said again: "If one has accepted wine for half interest, with the
intention of taking it to the suburb of Dwulchpht (where usually wine is
dear), and by the time it reached there the price was lowered, the law
is that the owner has to accept the return of the wine." The schoolmen
propounded a question: How is it when the same was vinegar? Said R.
Hillel to R. Ashi:

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When we were at R.
Kahana's he said to us, the same is the case with vinegar, as he agrees
with R. Jose b. Hanina's statement above.

"*Old wine*," etc. A Boraitha in addition to our Mishna states that if
it was said, "very old wine, it must keep its good quality until the
feast of tabernacle in the third year."

MISHNA *IV*.: If one sells to one a place for the purpose of building a
wedding-house for his son or a widow-house for his daughter, and the
same is the case if a contractor undertakes to build such for him, the
size must be not less than four ells in length by six in breadth; such
is the decree of R. Aqiba. R. Ishmael, however, maintains that this is
the size of a stable. If one wishes to build a stable for cattle, he
builds it four by six. The smallest house is no less than six by eight,
a large one eight by ten, and a triclinum (restaurant) ten by ten, and
the height must be a half of its length and of its width. An example of
this, said R. Simeon b. Gamaliel, was the building of the Temple.

GEMARA: Why does the Mishna state "a wedding-house for his son and a
widow-house for his daughter"? Let it state a wedding or a widow house
for his son or daughter. The Mishna incidentally teaches us that it is
not a good custom for a son-in-law to dwell with his father-in-law, as
it is written in the book of Ben Sira: "I have weighed everything on the
scale and did not find a thing to be lighter than bran; however, a groom
who resides in the house of his father-in-law is lighter than bran, and
still lighter than he is an invited guest who brings with him an
uninvited companion, and still lighter is the one who answers before he
has heard thoroughly the question, as it is written \[Prov. xviii. 13\]:
'When one returneth an answer before he understandeth (the question), it
is a folly unto him and a shame.'"

"*If one wishes to build a stable*," etc. Who said this? According to
some, R. Aqiba himself, and he said so; and although this is the size of
a stable for cattle, it nevertheless happens that human beings live in
such a building (and as the seller or the contractor did not stipulate
the size, the minimum may be taken). Others say R. Ishmael taught this
saying: That if one wishes to build a stable, it is the size of four by
six.

"*Triclinum*," etc. There is a Boraitha: For a *quantir*,

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

twelve ells square is needed. What does it mean? A fore yard?

"*An example of this*," etc. Who taught this? Some say R. Simeon b.
Gamaliel, and it should read thus. Whence is this deduced? Said R.
Simeon b. Gamaliel: All must be judged according to the building of the
Temple, and some say that the first Tana taught an example of it (and he
was about to finish his statement with "the building of the Temple," but
R. Simeon b. Gamaliel interrupted him saying:) Do you want to compare
all common buildings with the building of the Temple; do all people
build such buildings?

We have learned in a Boraitha: Anonymous teachers say the height must be
not less than the length of the crossbeams of the ceiling. But why not
say, simply, the height must be as the width? If you wish, it may be
said that usually a house is wider at the top than at the bottom; and if
you wish, it may be said that, because the ends of the beams are placed
in the enclosures of the wall, they are longer than the width of the
house.

MISHNA *V*.: If one possesses a well, situated on the other side of his
neighbor's house (by inheritance, or even bought from him with a path),
so that when water is needed he must pass through the house, he may
enter and leave at the time people usually enter and leave. However, he
is not allowed to take his cattle to the well, but he has to take water
for them outside of the house and water them. The owner of the well, as
well as the owner of the house, has a right to put a lock on it.

GEMARA: A lock on what? Said R. Johanan: Both locks may be put on the
well. It is right that the owner of the well should put a lock on his
well, so that no one can use the water; but for what purpose should the
owner of the house put a lock on it? Said R. Elazar: Lest his neighbor,
while passing his house to the well in his absence, should remain alone
with his wife.

MISHNA *VI*.: If one has a garden inside of his neighbor's garden, he
may enter and leave only when people are wont to do so. He must not take
buyers with him to his garden, and be also has no right to pass through
his neighbor's garden for the purpose of entering another field
conjoining this one, when he has no business in his own garden; and only
the owner of

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

the outside garden has a right to sow the path. If, however, a path was
designated to him by court, on the side, with the consent of both
parties, then he may enter and leave whenever he pleases and may also
take with him buyers; however, the right to pass through to another
field is not given, and neither of them has the right to sow the path.

GEMARA: R. Jehudah in the name of Samuel said: If one says, "I sell you
a place of one ell for digging a well to water your dry land," it must
contain the width of two ells, and he also has to add him two ells from
his field to the edges of the well, on which to erect walls to prevent
the overflow of the water; and if he said, "I sell you an ell for making
a sewer," it must be one ell wide and one-half ell to each edge. But who
has a right to sow the edges (while the walls were not as yet trade)? R.
Jehudah in the name of Samuel said: The owner of the field; and R.
Nharnan in the name of Samuel said: The owner of the field may plant
trees there, but not sow it, as by sowing he harms the water.

R. Jehudah in the name of Samuel said again: If the walls of a channel
fall, the owner of it may repair it from the material of the field upon
which the walls were placed; as certainly they fall on the same field
where they were placed (but the material was scattered by the wind all
over the field). R. Papa, however, opposed, saying that the owner of the
field may claim that the water of "your well has underwashed the
material and caused it to fall"; therefore he gave another reason, that
such a stipulation must have been in existence when he hired that place,
for otherwise he would not have wasted his money.

MISHNA *VII*.: If there was a public thoroughfare through one's field
and he took it for himself and designated another one at the side of his
field, what he has given is considered the public's, and to that which
he took for himself he does not acquire title. If one sells a path in
his field for a private thoroughfare it must be four ells, for the
public it must be no less than sixteen. A way for the government has no
limit. The way for carrying a corpse to the grave has also no limit;
however, the space where the people stand for condoling was determined
by the judges of Ziboras of a space where four kabhs may be sown.

GEMARA: Why should he not acquire title to that thoroughfare

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

he took for himself, when he designated another one for the public; let
him take a stick with which to drive off intruders, or do you want to
infer from this that one cannot take. the law in his own hands, even
when he suffered damage? Said R. Zebid in the name of Rabha: It is to be
feared that if this would be allowed, one would give to the public a
crooked way; but R. Mesharshia in the name of Rabha said that our Mishna
treats of a case wherein the owner of the field has designated such. R.
Ashi, however, maintains that a way which is placed; at one side is
considered crooked, because it is near to one who resides near to this
side, while it is far to him who resides on the other side, (and
therefore he does not acquire title) to that which he took. But let him
say to the public, "take your way and return mine" (and the Mishna
states what he has given is lost). It is in accordance with R. Eliezer
of the following Boraitha: "R. Jehudah said in the name of R. Eliezer,
if the public has chosen a way for itself, what was done remains." But
may the public be robbers, according to R. Eliezer? Said R. Gid'l in the
name of Rabh: He speaks in case the public has lost a way in this field
(*i.e.*, some time ago there was a thoroughfare which afterwards was
lost). If so, why then said Rabba b. R. Huna in the name of Rabh that
the Halakha does not prevail with R. Eliezer? The one who has taught
this statement was not aware of the other statement (*i.e.*, R. Gid'l
does not approve the statement of Rabba b. R. Huna in the name of Rabh).
But according to Rabba b. R. Huna, what is the reason of our Mishna's
statement, that of R. Jehuda, who said above ([p.
145](t0707.htm#page_145).md) that a path of which the public took charge
must not be spoiled? By which act did the public acquire title to the
thoroughfare, according to R. Eliezer? By passing, as we have learned in
the following Boraitha: If one passed (in an ownerless field) on its
length and breadth he acquired title to the place he has passed, so is
the decree of R. Eliezer. The sages, however, maintain that passing has
no effect at all, and title is not acquired unless he makes a hazakah.
Said R. Elazar: The reason of R. Eliezer is the following verse
\[Genesis, xiii. 17\]: "Arise, walk through the land in the length of it
and in the breadth of it, for unto thee I will give it." The sages say
this cannot be taken for a support, however, as Abraham was beloved by
Heaven, and it was said to him for

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

the purpose of making easier for his children the subjection of the
land. Said R. Jose b. Hanina: The sages admit to R. Eliezer in case of a
footpath between vineyards, because it was made for passing, title is
also given by passing. When such a case came before R. Itz'hak b. Ami he
decided that the plaintiff should get a footpath upon which he should be
able to carry a bundle of branches on his shoulders, which in turning
here and there should not touch the walls. But this is said in a case
wherein the places for the walls are not yet designated; but if they
were, the space should be given him, so as to put one foot after the
other.

"*For a private*," etc. There is a Boraitha: Anonymous teachers say: "As
much as an ass with its load could pass." The judges of the exile said:
Two cubits and a half. And R. Huna said: The Halakha prevails with them.
But did not R. Huna say elsewhere that the Halakha prevails with the
anonymous teachers? The limit of both is "equal."

"*A public thoroughfare is sixteen ells*." The rabbis taught: A private
way is four ells, a way from one city to the other is eight ells, a
public way is sixteen ells, and the way to the cities of refuge (Num.
xxxv. ii) thirty-two. \[Said R. Huna: Whence is this deduced? From the
Scripture (Deut. xix. 3): "*The* way to *them*." It should be "a way,"
and the word "the" makes it double.\] The way of the government has no
limit, as the king has the right to erect partitions, houses, and no one
has a right to prevent him, and the way for burying a corpse has no
limit, because of the honor of the dead. <span

MISHNA *VIII*.: If one sells a place for digging a grave, or an
undertaker makes a grave for one, the inside of the cave must be four by
six, and opening into it eight niches for coffins, three on each side
and two at the top and bottom. The length of the niches is four ells,
the height seven spans, and the width six. R. Simeon, however, said: The
inside of the cave must be six by eight, the niches must be thirteen,
four on each side, three on the upper side, and one on the right side of
the door and one on the left. He also makes a fore yard at the mouth of
the cave six ells square, as much as the coffin with its carrier needs.
He also has to open to this fore yard two,

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

caves from two sides. R. Simeon, however, said four to all its four
sides. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel, however, maintains that all must be done
according to the rock (*i.e.*, if the earth is soft more niches could be
made, but if rocky the number must be limited accordingly).

GEMARA: The two niches which R. Simeon requires, one on the right side
of the door, etc., how shall he dig them? If their length should be dug
from the wall of the cave under the fore yard, then they will be trodden
down; furthermore, there is a Mishna to the effect that one who stands
in the yard of a grave is clean, but if the niches should be dug under
the yard the one who stands above would not be clean. Said R. Jose b. R.
Hanina: He made the niches like an upright bolt; *i.e.*, placed the
bodies in an upright position. But did not R. Johanan say that asses are
buried in like manner? According to him, the niches should be made in
the corners. But then each of them would come in contact with the other.
Said R. Ashi: If he makes those in the corners deeper (according to R.
Simeon, who said that four niches must be on each side), if they were
all equally dug they would come in contact. It must be said that he digs
some of them deeper, and the same may be said here. <span
id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md) R. Huna b. R. Jehoshuah, however,
maintains that he makes the niches crooked. (Says the Gemara:) This
statement does not hold, as according to it he would have to make eight
inches in the space of eleven and one-fifth ells, which is
impossible. <span id="fr_65"></span>[2](#fn_65.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_61"></span>[217:1](t0716.htm#fr_61.md) The translation of
"hazakah" is chiefly "occupancy"; however, this term is applicable to
everything which is the habit of persons, animals, etc.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[223:1](t0716.htm#fr_62.md) The text treats
concerning the benedictions on wine, beer, etc., for which the proper
place is the Tract Benediction, and to which it will be transferred

<span id="fn_63"></span>[229:1](t0716.htm#fr_63.md) The continuation of the
text about graves and condolence, etc., we have translated to Tract
Great Mourning, page 60.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[230:1](t0716.htm#fr_64.md) The text is so
complicated here that the commentators have to make many illustrations,
and after all the matter is hardly understood. However, according to our
method we could not omit this, as it is essential from the historical
point of view to know how these graves are made. We have done our best
to make it intelligible.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[230:2](t0716.htm#fr_65.md) In the text are also
mathematical calculations by the rule that one ell square contains one
ell and two-fifths when crooked, which is not exactly correct. We have
already mentioned this in a foot-note in Erubin, and therefore we have
omitted the whole discussion here.
