# CHAPTER VII.

RULES AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING ROCKS AND PITS IN GROUND SOLD; THE
QUANTITIES OF GREATER OR LESS MEASURE WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT VOID A SALE
OF FIELDS, VILLAGES, ETC.

MISHNA *I*.: If one says: "I sell you earth the size where one kur can
be sown, and there were crevices ten spans deep, or rocks ten spans
high," they are not measured, but if less than that size they are
measured. If, however, he said to him, "about the size of a kur," and
there were crevices or rocks even more than the size of ten spans, they
are measured.

GEMARA: Said R. Itz'hak: The statement of the Mishna about rocks and
crevices which are measured when they are less than ten spans holds good
only when all of them together do not measure four kabhs, but not if
they do. Said R. Uqba b. Hama: Even then they are measured only when
they are scattered within five kabhs space (but in less they are not
measured); and R. Hyya b. Abba in the name of R. Johanan says that five
kabhs do not suffice, and they are measured only when they are scattered
within the greater part of the field, which is at least sixteen kabhs,
as a kur is thirty kabhs; and R. Hyya b. Abba himself questioned: How is
the law according (to R. Johanan's theory) if the greater part of the
rocks in question were scattered within the smaller part of the field,
and the smaller part of them within the larger part of the field (and if
altogether they measured four kabhs)? These questions are not
decided. <span id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66.md)

There is a Boraitha: "If there were a single rock (but it bears a
separate name; *e.g.*, 'the west rock') even if of less than ten spans,
it is not measured; and also if the rock were placed

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

near to the boundary, whatever size it may be it is not measured." <span
id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67.md)

MISHNA *II*.: "I sell you earth of the size wherein a kur can be sown,
measured with a line." If there were a trifle less, he may deduct; if a
trifle more, the buyer has to return it. If, however, the seller says
"about this size, a little more or less," even if there were less than a
quarter of a kabh on each saah, the sale is valid; but if it were more
than that size, an account must be taken. In case the buyer has to make
return, it shall be in money; however, if he wishes to return him land,
he may do so. And why was it said that the buyer should return the
seller money? To favor the seller, so that if there were a trifle more
the buyer should not have the right to return him this trifle, which the
seller could not use; but if there were a kabh and a half more than the
prescribed size, it means in the case of nine kabhs of land in a field
and a half kabh in a garden, and according to R. Aqiba even a quarter of
a kabh, then the buyer may return the land, and not only the land which
is in excess of the prescribed size, but even that of this prescribed
size itself is to be returned with the other.

GEMARA: The schoolmen propounded a question: If the seller said "the
size of a kur," without any addition, how is the law? Come and hear. If
the seller says, "I sell you an estate the size of a kur," or "about the
size of a kur, a little less or more, I sell you," and thereafter it
were found a quarter of a kabh less or more to a saah, the sale is
valid. Hence we see that even if be does not add to the words "the size
of a kur," it is the same as if he would say "about." Nay, the Boraitha
is to be explained thus: The last part of the Boraitha explains the
first part. If one says, "I sell you of the size of a kur," "about" is
to be understood in case he should add a trifle less or more. R. Ashi
objected: If this were so, why the repetition "I sell you, I sell you"?
Therefore the Boraitha is to be explained as above, that the size of a
kur means "about," and so it is.

"*It shall be in money*." We see from this that the advantage of the
seller and not the buyer is taken into consideration; but

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

valid? If, however, the estate is larger, the court compels both the
seller to sell and the buyer to buy; hence we see that the advantage of
both is taken into consideration? (*I.e.*, that even have we not learned
in the following Boraitha: If there were less or more than seven kabhs
and a half on a kur, the sale is if the seller insists that the excess
should be returned to him, he is not to be listened to if it is an
advantage for the buyer to have it.) The Boraitha treats that at the
time it was found over the prescribed size, the estate was lower in
price and the seller willing to sell. Therefore we say to the buyer,
"You may reckon it at the existing price," and the same is said to the
seller, "If you do not wish the estate to be returned to you, you must
accept the existing price." But have we not learned in another Boraitha
that if the buyer compensates the seller, he must reckon at the previous
rate? That Boraitha speaks that when the reverse was the case, the price
was low at the time of the sale and became higher after it was known
that there was an excess over the prescribed size.

"*It means in the case of nine kabhs*," etc. Said R. Huna: This applies
even in a valley which is of more than ten kurs. R. Na'hman, however,
says seven and a half to each kur; but if there were a kabh and a half
more (which counts nine kabhs) even to one kur, all must be returned,
even if to the other kurs the addition were not over the prescribed
size. Rabha objected R. Na'hman from our Mishna, which states that if he
left nine kabhs in a field, etc. Does not the Mishna mean at least two
kurs as the size of the usual field? Nay, it means one kur. Farther on,
in a garden, a half of a kabh is given as the minimum of excess. Does it
not mean at least two saahs, as usually a garden is called of that size?
Nay, it means one saah, and according to R. Aqiba one quarter. Does it
not mean, if the garden was a saah? Nay, it means if it was half a saah.
R. Ashi questioned: If one sold a field, and afterwards, but before the
money was paid, it became a garden, and there were found more than a
quarter to a saah, but it should not reach the size of nine kabhs or
*vice versa*, how should the prescribed size be reckoned--as that of a
field or that of a garden? This question remains undecided.

There is a Boraitha: "If the estate over the prescribed size sold was
conjoined with the other estate of the seller, even if

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

that were but a trifle, the buyer has to return the seller the estate."
R. Ashi questioned: How is the law if there were a well between this
estate sold and the other estate of the seller, a channel, a public
thoroughfare, or a row of trees, should these constitute lines of
demarcation or not? This question remains undecided.

"*And not only the land which is in excess*," etc. How is this to be
understood? Taught Rabhin b. R. Na'hman: Not only that which was over
the prescribed size the buyer returns the seller, but all the quarters
to each kur, although the rest be not over the prescribed size, he must
return.

MISHNA *III*.: "I sell you the estate with a measurement, a trifle more
or less." The last words, "more or less," nullify those preceding them.
"I sell you a trifle more or less to be measured with a line." The last
words here nullify the preceding ones (and the seller must give the
purchaser a just measurement; so that if the land were in excess, the
excess must be returned, and if less the seller must supply the
deficiency), such is the decree of ben Nanas.

GEMARA: Said R. Abba b. Mamal in the name of Rabh: "The colleagues of
ben Nanas differ with him." What came he to teach us? Have we not
learned in the Middle Gate, p. 269, Mishna 8, that it happened in
Ciphorius that one rented a bath-house for twelve golden dinars a year?
The payment was to be one dinar monthly; and thereafter the year was
made intercalary. When the case came before R. Simeon b. Gamaliel and R.
Jose they decided that the payment for the intercalated time should be
made at the same rate as for the ordinary time. If from that Mishna one
says that the last words, "one dinar monthly," are to be interpreted as
a retraction of the first words, "twelve a year," the last words, "a
dinar monthly," may also be interpreted as explaining the former,
"twelve a year" (over which the sages differed with ben Nanas); however,
here, in that the last words cannot be interpreted as an explanation,
but as a retraction of the former, the sages agree with him. He comes to
teach us that they differ also in this case. R. Jehudah in the name of
Samuel said: This which is taught in our Mishna is in the words of ben
Nanas, but the sages say that the shorter expression must always have
the greater weight (*i.e.*, "with a measurement" is shorter than "a

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

trifle less or more"), no matter whether the shorter phrase were said
before or after the longer one. Says the Gemara: Shall we assume that
with the expression "this" Samuel meant to say that he himself does not
agree with him? Do not both Rabh and Samuel say (p. 188) that if one
said "a kur for thirty selas," he may retract even at the last saah; and
if he added each saah for one sela, to all which was measured title is
acquired, which corresponds with the decision of ben Nanas? Therefore we
must say that he meant to say "this," and I agree therewith. But is that
so? Did not Samuel say (Middle Gate, p. 270): "The decision was so made
. . ." but if they had appeared in the beginning, would it be entirely
the owner's; and if in the end, the renter's? (This, at all events,
cannot correspond with ben Nanas' decision.) Therefore it must be said
again that by the word "this" he means that "I do not agree," and the
reason of his decision in the case of each saah for selah is because
that which was measured is considered already in his hands, and the same
is the case with the rent for the intercalary month; if at the end of
the month, it belongs to the renter, because it is already in his hand.
R. Huna said: It was said in the college of Rabh: If one said: "I sell
this to you for an *istra* a hundred *moahs*, he must give him a hundred
moahs; but if he says a hundred moahs an istra he has to give him an
istra although it is less in value than a hundred moahs."

What came he to teach us--that the last expression must be considered?
Has not Rabh said this already concerning the case of the cited Mishna
(page 270): "If I were there, I should give it to the owner of the
house" (and that is because the last words were "a dinar monthly")? Lest
one should say that in one case the last words ("hundred moahs," or
*vice versa*) are to be considered as an explanation to the first words,
he comes to teach us that it is not so.

MISHNA *IV*.: If one says, "I sell you this estate, the size of a kur,
with its marks and boundaries;" and afterwards it were found that the
size is less than stipulated--if it were less than a sixth of the whole
size, the sale is valid; but if there were a sixth wanting, the buyer
may deduct from the payment.

GEMARA: It was taught: R. Huna and R. Jehudah differ in the explanation
of our Mishna. According to the former

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

the Mishna means that an exact sixth should be considered as less than a
sixth, and the Mishna is to be explained thus: "With less than a sixth
wanting, a sixth inclusive, the sale is valid." If, however, more than a
sixth is wanting, it may be deducted. According to R. Jehudah the Mishna
means that an exact sixth is to be considered as more, and it is to be
explained thus: "With less than a sixth wanting the sale is valid; a
sixth, however, or more wanting is to be deducted."

An objection was raised from the following Tosephtha: "With its marks
and boundaries, and there was a sixth less or a sixth more, it parallels
a case wherein the court appraises an estate, and the sale is valid."
Now we know that in a case wherein the court appraises, if there were an
error as to an exact sixth, it is considered as if it were more, and the
appraisement is void; hence this contradicts R. Huna? R. Huna may say
that there is no contradiction, as the Tosephtha ends with the words
"the sale is valid," and if this paralleled the case wherein the court
appraises, how could it be valid in case there were more than a sixth?
Does not the law provide that in the case of an error of the court in
more than a sixth, the appraisemerit is void? It must be said then that
it is parallel in one respect but not in the other; and it is to be
explained thus: It parallels the case wherein the court appraises with
an error of less than a sixth (which does not affect the appraisement),
but it does not parallel the case in which the error of the court is of
a sixth or more and affects the appraisement, which differs from our
case, as the purchaser has only to deduct the money value of the
deficiency, while the sale is still valid. <span
id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68.md)

R. Papa bought an estate from some one who told him that it measured the
size of twenty saahs. After it was measured it was found that there were
only fifteen; and the case came before Abayi, who decided that the sale
was valid, because the seller had used the qualifying words "as you see
its marks and boundaries." But have we not learned that if there were
more than a sixth lacking its value is to be deducted, and here there is
a fourth part? In the first case the condition is not known to the buyer
before the sale; but in the latter case, as the condition was known to
R. Papa and he saw it at the time he

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

bought, it must be supposed that he had considered and accepted it.
Rejoined R. Papa: But did he not tell me that it measured twenty? He
probably meant to say that "these fifteen are better than twenty
elsewhere."

There is a Boraitha: R. Jose said: "Some brothers divided their
inheritance by lot, and when to each of them his lot fell, all of them
acquired title to their shares." Why so? Said R. Elazar: At the time the
land of Israel was allotted to the tribes. But was there not also the
Urim v'tumim, as it is said farther on that the high priest Elazar had
on the Urim v'tumim, and then the lots were cast? Said R. Ashi: By their
arrangement prior to allotment (whereby the estate was divided into
shares of equal value) they had prepared themselves that each should
acquire title to the share which the lot should cast for him, and
therefore no other ceremony was necessary.

It was taught: To two brothers who had divided their inheritance between
them came a third brother (of whose existence they were not previously
aware). Their division is null and void according to Rabh. Samuel,
however, maintains that each of the two must relinquish a third of his
inheritance to the third brother (*e.g.*, they inherited six fields, and
each of them must give one of these to the newcomer, so that the three
brothers may have two fields apiece). Said Rabha to R. Na'hman:
According to Rabh, who says that the division is null and void, it must
be said he holds that since all of them did not share in the first
division, the inheritance must be redivided. Would the same be the case
with three partners, two of whom have divided (in the presence of three
persons who are considered a Beth Din) in the absence of the third one,
and there is a decision (Middle Gate, p. 74) that such holds good? The
cases are dissimilar. In the latter case the partners divided the
property into three shares, and as it was done in the presence of a Beth
Din the division holds good; but in the former case the two brothers had
divided the inheritance into two parts only, as they were unaware of the
third brother's existence.

Said R. Papa to Abayi: According to Samuel's decision that the first
division is valid, it must be said he holds that such an act, done in
accordance with the law, must not be abrogated, although thereafter it
appears that the brothers took more than belonged to them; but did not
both Rabh and Samuel say: If

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

one says, "I sell you a kur for thirty selas," the seller may retract
even at the last saah (above, [p. 235](#page_235).md)? (We see then that
even when done in accordance with the law an act may still be
abrogated.) There is, however, here a difference. The rabbis enacted
that law to please both the seller and the buyer. (*I.e.*, in case the
price should become lower, before the buyer has received the property,
it is to his advantage to retract; and in case the price becomes higher,
the advantage is for the seller. Hence this law is beneficial to both.)

It was taught: If brothers divided their inheritance and a creditor of
their father came and took away the share of one of them, according to
Rabh the former division is null and void. Samuel, however, said that
such was this brother's lot, and it did not concern the other. R. Assi,
however, maintains, not as Rabh, that the division is void, and they
must divide the remainder, and not as Samuel, that it does not at all
concern the other one; but that the second brother must surrender one
quarter of his estate and a quarter of the money he has inherited. Rabh
holds that the heirs, even after their division, are still to be
considered heirs (hence if one of them has lost the property through his
father's debt, he is still an heir to the remainder), while Samuel holds
that at the time they divide they are considered buyers (each of them
buying his share of his brother) without any security; and consequently
each has no further concern after the division. R. Assi was doubtful
whether they are to be considered heirs of buyers; therefore the half
which ought to be taken from the one who did not suffer loss is
considered doubtful money, and there is a rule that doubtful money is to
be divided. Said R. Papa: The Halakha concerning the two cases, that of
the third brother as well as that wherein the share of one was taken
away by their father's creditor, prevails in accordance with Samuel, who
says the division holds good, and it is for them to divide from their
shares in payment of the debt. Amimar, however, said: The Halakha
prevails in accordance with Rabh, who said that the division is void and
the property must be redivided, and so the Halakha prevails.

The rabbis taught: If there are three who have qualified as a Beth Din
to appraise the estate of one deceased, for the support of his widow and
daughters, and if one says that in his opinion the estate is worth
twenty-five selas (a moanah of

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 100 zuz), and the
two others say two hundred or *vice versa*, the opinion of the
individual is of no effect; but if one appraises the estate at one
hundred zuz, which are twenty-five selas, the second for twenty, and the
third for thirty, the value is fixed at one hundred zuz. R. Eliezer b.
R. Zadok, however, says that it should be taken for ninety zuz, and
anonymous teachers say that a third of the difference between the second
and third valuations must be added to the second, which will give 93
1/3, zuz. The reason of him who says the estate is worth one hundred zuz
is that the opinion of the arbitrator is to be taken into consideration,
and the reason for R. Eliezer's opinion that the estate is worth ninety
zuz is that he who appraised it at eighty underestimated by ten zuz,
while he who appraised it at 100 overestimated by ten zuz, and as there
is a majority who appraised it at not more than 100 zuz, the third, who
appraised it at twenty zuz over a moah, is not to be taken into
consideration at all. Why not say that the one who said 100 zuz has
underestimated by ten and he who says thirty has overestimated by ten,
and the estate should therefore be valued at 100? Because the majority
declare it not worth more than 100 zuz, or one moah. The anonymous
teachers maintain that the estate is worth 93 1/3 zuz, because the one
who estimated its value at twenty selas (eighty zuz) underestimated by
13 1/3, and the one who said 100 zuz overestimated by 13 1/3, although
he had intended to say 103 1/3 zuz, but thought he would not like to
make his difference too large. And why not say that the one who said
thirty selas (120 zuz) has overestimated by thirteen, and the estimate
should be fixed at 113 zuz? The opinion of the majority that the estate
is not worth over a moah is to be taken into consideration. Said R.
Huna: The Halakha prevails with the anonymous teachers. Said R. Ashi:
The reason of the anonymous teachers is not acceptable; should we decide
according to them? There is a Boraitha that the judges of the exile are
in accordance with the anonymous teachers, and R. Huna said again that
so the Halakha prevails, but R. Ashi objected again for the same reason
stated above.

MISHNA *V*.: If one says "I sell you the half of the field" (the half of
the value is meant), the better one against the inferior is to he
appraised, and the seller has a right to give the buyer the latter. The
same is the case when he said "I sell you

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

the southern half of this field," and the buyer takes the half
determined on by the seller. The seller, however, has to give space for
a partition, and for a large and a small ditch. What is the breadth of a
large ditch? Six spans. And of a small one? Three.

GEMARA: Said R. Hyya b. R. Abba in the name of R. Johanan: The buyer has
to take the inferior. And he (when he heard this statement from R.
Johanan) said to him: Does not the Mishna say "the better one against
the inferior is to be appraised"? And should not this be explained to
mean that each of them should take half of both good and inferior? And
he answered: It seems to me that you have eaten too many dates in
Babylon (so that you have no time to descend into the depths of the
Mishna). Does not the Mishna contain the same expression, in the latter
part, <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md) concerning the sale of the
south side of his field? And why the repetition? It should read "he
should take a half at the south side," and we would understand it to
mean half of the size. We must then say that it is repeated to teach
that also in that case the half of the value is meant, as the same was
in the first part.

"*The partition*," etc. There is a Boraitha: "The large ditch must be
outside and the small one inside of the field, but both beyond the
partition, so that beasts may not jump over the partition in the field."
Why then the small ditch? Does not the large one suffice for this
purpose? Because it is six spans wide, the beasts could enter in it and
jump over. But does not the small ditch suffice? Because it is small,
the beasts could stand on the edge of it and jump over. And how much
shall the space be between the large and the small ditch? One span.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_66"></span>[231:1](t0717.htm#fr_66.md) In the text are some
other questions: If the rocks were placed round, or square, etc.; and
these need many illustrations, and all remain at last undecided. As they
are of no importance, we have omitted them.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[232:1](t0717.htm#fr_67.md) The text contains
questions of no importance--*e.g.*, if the rocks were placed round,
crooked, etc.--which remain undecided. We have therefore omitted the
whole discussion.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[236:1](t0717.htm#fr_68.md) We are compelled to
explain this in accordance with R. Gershom, as Rashbam's explanation is
still more complicated.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[240:1](t0717.htm#fr_69.md) The Mishna repeats the
same language concerning the southern part which we, according to the
sense, have translated "the same is the case."
