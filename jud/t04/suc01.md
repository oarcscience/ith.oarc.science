TO THE PRESIDENT OF "TEMPLE ISRAEL," NEW YORK,

DANIEL P. HAYS, ESQ.

In consideration that through his influence, this Congregation is the
first and unique among the reformed to establish a Succah in connection
with their Temple, the Editor takes much pleasure in dedicating the
tract which treats about the Succah, to him, to the Rabbi, and all the
associates who took part in introducing same.

Very respectfully,

MICHAEL L. RODKINSON,

New York, Tuesday ‏פּסח שני‎, April 25th, 1899.
