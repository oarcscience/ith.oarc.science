# CHAPTER III.

REGULATIONS CONCERNING FISHING AND HUNTING ON FESTIVALS.

MISHNA: It is not allowed to catch fish from aquaria on festivals, nor
to give them food; but one may hunt beasts or birds in parks, and feed
them. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says: Not all aquaria and parks are
regarded in the same light. This is the general rule. In case the
animals have to be hunted it is prohibited; but when no hunting is
required, it is not.

GEMARA: There is a contradiction. We have learned in a Tosephta that in
parks beasts and fowls must not be caught on the festival, and must not
be fed. The contradiction between the Tosephta and Mishna concerning the
beasts could be explained that the Tosephta is in accordance with R.
Jehudah, who prohibits this (Sabbath, p. 216); but the contradiction
about fowls, how can it be explained? And if it be said, that here also
there is no difficulty, because the Tosephta meant an unroofed park,
while the Mishna spoke of a roofed park, did not the Mishna in Tract
Sabbath state that according to all a fowl must not be caught in a
house, and a house is certainly meant a roofed one? Said Rabha bar R.
Huna: The Tosephta meant a bird called Durur in Arabic, which it is very
difficult to catch, and which never becomes domesticated. As the
disciples of R. Ishmael taught: Why is this fowl named Durur? Because to
it the house and the field are the same. Now, when we know this, the
contradiction about beasts can also be explained, that the Mishna speaks
of a small park, and the Tosephta of a great one, where it is difficult
to catch. What is called a small park, or a great park? Said R. Ashi: If
the shadows of the two walls on the ground touch, then it is small, but
otherwise it is great.

"*R. Simeon b. Gamaliel says*," etc. Said R. Joseph in the name of R.
Jehudah quoting Samuel: The Halakha prevails according to R. Simeon b.
Gamaliel. Said Abayi to him: Is there any one that differs from him,
that it is necessary for you to declare that the Halakha prevails
according to R. Simeon b.

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

Gamaliel? Said the former: And what difference is it to you? Rejoined
Abayi: Shall the Gemara be like a song, to learn it without knowing any
reason for each decision?

"*This is the general rule*," etc. What is meant by "have to be hunted"?
The same authority says in the name of the same authority: If one must
say, bring a net to catch it. Said Abayi to R. Joseph: Of geese and
chickens it is usually said, bring a net, we will catch them.
Nevertheless we have learned in a Boraitha that whoso catches geese and
chickens is not culpable? Said Rabba bar R. Huna in the name of Samuel:
The latter come to their places in the evening, and the owner is
responsible for their feeding (therefore whoso catches them is not
culpable), but animals of a park do not do so, and the owner is not
obliged to feed them.

MISHNA: If nets have been spread for fish or wild game on the eve of a
festival, it is not allowed to take from them, on the festival, unless
it is known that they have been caught before its commencement. It once
happened that a Gentile brought on the festival a present of fish to
Rabban Gamaliel, when he said: It is allowed to use them, but I do not
wish to accept presents from that man.

GEMARA: Is the deed of R. Gamaliel not in contradiction with the
teaching of the Mishna? The Mishna is not completed. It must be read
thus: If it is doubtful whether a thing was prepared from the day
before, it is prohibited; but R. Gamaliel permits it; and it once
happened also that a Gentile brought fish on a festival, in the morning,
as a present to R. Gamaliel, and he said: They are permitted, etc. R.
Jehudah in the name of Samuel said: The Halakha does not prevail
according to R. Gamaliel. According to others, R. Jehudah declared his
decision about the following Boraitha: Beasts from parks may be
slaughtered, but not from nets (because it is not known on what day they
were found there, on the festival or before it). R. Simeon b. Elazar
said: If one found the nets disturbed on the eve of a festival, it is
certain that they had been caught before the festival, and they are
permitted; but if he came on the festival, and saw them disturbed, it is
certain they were caught during the festival, and they are not allowed.
Is this saying not contradictory in itself? It says: If he found it
disturbed on the eve of a festival, it is certain that they were caught
before the festival, and they are allowed, from which it is to be
understood, that if it was doubtful, it is not allowed; and in the
latter part it says:

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

{If he found it disturbed on the festival, etc., it is certain that they
were caught during the festival, and they are not allowed, from which it
is to be inferred that when there is a doubt it is permissible? It means
to say thus: If he found it disturbed on the eve, it is certain that
they were already caught, and are permissible; but if it was doubtful,
it is to be considered that they were caught on the festival, and are
not permissible. Said R. Jehudah in the name of Samuel: The Halakha
prevails according to R. Simeon b. Elazar.

"*When he said, it is allowed*," etc. Allowed what? Rabh said: They are
permitted to be received, but Levi said, they are permitted to be eaten.

Said Rabh: A man should never absent himself from the house of learning,
even for one hour, because I and Levi both were in the college when
Rabbi declared this Halakha. In the evening he said: They are permitted
to be eaten; but in the morning he said: They are permitted to be
received. I, who was in the college in the morning and heard his second
decision, gave up the first; but Levi, who was not, did not.

R. Papa said: The Halakha is as follows: If a Gentile brought a present
to an Israelite on a festival, if the same kind of productions are found
yet on the trees or ground, it is prohibited; and even in the evening,
one must wait till the time when such a thing may be gathered and
brought. But if that kind of production is no longer found on trees or
on the field, then, if the present has been carried from within the
legal limit, it may be accepted, but if from beyond the legal limit it
may not. And if it has been brought for one Israelite, another may use
it.

Rabba bar R. Huna said in the name of Rabh: When one has choked a pond,
on the eve of a festival, and on the morrow he found there fish, they
are permitted. Said R. Hisda: From the teaching of our Master we can
infer that a beast which was overnight in the garden need not have been
prepared on the preceding day (may be used). Said R. Na'hman: My
colleague has attempted to decide the quarrel of great men. In the case
of the fish, the man does nothing; but in this case, he must catch it.
But how could R. Hisda decide that it has not to be prepared, did we not
learn in a Boraitha, that a beast that was overnight in a garden must
have been prepared, and a bird must have had its wings bound that it
should not be exchanged for another? And this law is one of those which
it has been testified, that they were said by Shemaia and Abtalian? This
objection remains.

{p. 49<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>

MISHNA: It is not allowed to kill on a festival an animal suffering from
a mortal disease, unless there is time to eat thereof, on that day, at
least the size of an olive, roasted. Rabbi Aqiba allows it, if there be
only time to eat thereof the size of an olive, raw, even in the very
place where it is slaughtered. If it has been killed in the field, the
entire carcass may not be carried home on poles or sticks, but only
piecemeal, by hand.

GEMARA: Said Rami bar Abba: The taking off the skin, and the cutting of
a burnt-offering (which could be burnt without this) is only to teach
the latter generations, that one shall not eat meat of a slaughtered
animal before the skin is taken off, and was not cut in the usual
pieces. Is this also a necessary teaching? Yea, as we have learned in a
Boraitha, a man shall not commence eating garlic or onions from the
roots, but from the leaves; otherwise his taste is coarse. Likewise, a
man should not empty his goblet at a draught, otherwise he resembles a
drunkard. <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md)

A Boraitha states in the name of R. Meir: Why was the Law given to
Israel? Because they are bold (difficult to be vanquished). The
disciples of R. Ishmael taught: It is written \[Deut. xxxiii. 2\]: "From
his right hand he gave a fiery law unto them." The Holy One, blessed be
He, said: The Israelites are so bold that a fiery law must be given to
them. According to others, the law of this people is like fire, because
if such a law had not been given to them, no nation and tongue could
stand before them. And this is as R. Simeon b. Lakish said: The boldest
nation of all nations is Israel. <span id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21.md)

"*The entire carcass may not be brought on poles*." The rabbis taught: A
blind man should not walk with his stick on a festival, nor a shepherd
with his bag (pouch); also, a man must not be carried in a chair. It
matters not whether it is a man or a woman. This is not so? Did not R.
Jacob bar Iddi send a message that an old man was in his neighborhood
and he was carried in a litter (*Lectica*), and they went to R. Joshuah
b. Levi and asked him whether it was lawful, and his answer was, that if
he was needed by many people, he could do so. And our Masters use as a
sup. port to this opinion words of Ahi Shakia, who said: I have carried
R. Huna in a chair on the festival from Hini to Shilli, and back. And R.
Na'hman bar Itz'hak told: I have carried Mar Samuel

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

from the shadow into sunshine, and back. The reason is stated, because
if many people needed him it was allowed.

Says R. Na'hman to Hama bar Adda, the messenger of Zion: When you go to
Palestine, turn down from your road and ascend the "Ladder of Tzur" and
visit R. Jacob bar Iddi and ask him: How is their custom with a litter?
When he arrived there, R. Jacob bar Iddi was dead, and he found R.
Zrika, and asked him: How is your custom in regard to litters? And he
answered: So said R. Ammi: One may be carried in them, provided he shall
not put his hands on the shoulders of the bearers. What is meant by
this? Said R. Joseph the son of Rabha: He shall not be carried in a
palanquin (a kind of litter which required that he who is carried should
hold by the shoulders of the bearers). Is that so? Did not R. Na'hman
allow his wife Yalta to be carried in a palanquin? The case with Yalta
was different; she was timid.

Amemar and Mar Zutra were carried on the Sabbath before the festivals on
a palanquin, because there was a great crowd and it was feared they
would be injured. According to others: Because it was so crowded by the
people who came to hear, that they could not pass through.

MISHNA: If a first-born animal fall into a pit on the festival (and it
is not known whether it was injured), R. Jehudah says: An expert may
descend and see whether it had already an in. curable and permanent
blemish, in which case it may be drawn up and killed, but not otherwise.
R. Simeon, however, said: If a blemish in a first-born animal was not
recognized on the eve of the festival, this is not considered prepared,
and must not be killed on the holiday.

GEMARA: On what point do they differ? Shall we assume that the point is,
if it is allowed to examine blemishes on the festival, that according to
R. Jehudah it is allowed, and according to R. Simeon it is not, then let
him say so plainly. Why do they differ here when it fell in a pit? This
case was necessary, lest one say that, because here is pity for the
living thing which falls in the pit, it shall be allowed to be taken out
for the purpose of slaughtering it, if it has a blemish, as R. Joshua
said further on (Chap. V., [p. 75](bet10.htm#page_75).md). Therefore it
comes to teach us that even in this case there is yet a difference of
opinion.

If it is so, then the Mishna should say, he shall *bring* it up and
slaughter it? And the difference on this point is only whether it should
be slaughtered or not? The case is, when he has already brought it up,
lest one say that when it is brought up

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

it may be slaughtered. Slaughtered! is it not a first-born without a
blemish? That means, if it got a blemish. But if it has the blemish now,
is it not yet Muktzah? The case is when it has a blemish which has to be
examined on the eve of the festival, and now through its fall it has got
a permanent blemish, and it can be slaughtered without any examination,
lest one say that because a blemish was from yesterday, the owner had it
in his mind, and might be slaughtered to-day, the Mishna comes to teach
us that it is not so.

The rabbis taught: Of a first-born animal which was without blemish (if
it fall into a pit on a festival), R. Jehudah the Nassi said: An expert
shall descend and see whether it had a blemish, and then it may be drawn
up and slaughtered; and if not, it shall not be slaughtered. Said R.
Simeon b. Menasia to him: Did not the sages say that blemishes must not
be examined on a festival? How so? If it got a blemish on the preceding
day it must not be examined on the festival; but if it got the blemish
on the festival, R. Simeon said that it could not be killed, because it
was not prepared from the day before. They all agree, however, that if
it was born on a festival with a blemish, it is considered as prepared.
Rabba bar R. Huna lectured: If the animal was born with a blemish, the
examination may be commenced on the festival. Said R. Na'hman to him:
Abba, <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) we have learned if he has
transgressed and had already examined, the examination can be useful,
and thou sayest that they may *commence* the examination? Said Abayi: It
seems to me that Rabba bar Huna is right, because the Boraitha teaches
three cases. If it got a blemish on the eve it must not be examined on
the festival. From this we may infer that it must not be examined, but
that if it has already been examined, it may be used. (The second case
is) if the blemish was got on the festival, R. Simeon said that it is
not prepared. From this we see that, even if it has been examined and a
real blemish found, it must also not be used. (And the third case is)
all agree that if it was born with a blemish on a festival, it is
considered prepared. Consequently, the examination may be commenced.

(Is that so?) We know that when R. Oshija came from Palestine he brought
a Boraitha. Either when he got a blemish on the eve of the festival, or
on the festival, according to the

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

sages it is not to be considered prepared (and the Boraitha must be in
accordance with R. Simeon, who says that it must not be examined on the
festival; and nevertheless the Boraitha teaches that even if the blemish
was from the eve of the festival, it is also not to be considered as
prepared, we can say, then, that if it was born with a blemish, it is
permissible only when it was examined, but it is not allowed to commence
the examination, as R. Na'hman said above?) Yea, it can be said so, but
the following Boraitha is yet a contradiction to him (why, then, should
you prefer the Boraitha which R. Oshiya brought to *the former*?)
Because the former Boraitha came from the sources of Adda bar
Ukhmi, <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) who was known to be erratic
in the Boraithas which he taught. Said R. Na'hman bar Itz'hak: It seems
from our Mishna also that it is in accordance with the Boraitha of R.
Oshiya, because it states: R. Simeon said: If the blemish was not
recognized on the eve, etc., it is not considered prepared. Now let us
see what is meant by "recognized"? Shall we assume that it was not
visible at all? This would be self-evident. We must then say that it was
not examined whether it was a permanent blemish or a temporary one;
nevertheless it states that it is not considered prepared, even when one
slaughtered it. (Consequently the latter part of the Mishna, which
states that "all agree," etc., "it is prepared," must be explained as R.
Na'hman corrected.)

Hillel asked of Rabha: Does the law of Muktzah exist for a half of
Sabbath (*i.e.*, whether a thing is fit for one half of Sabbath, but not
for the other half)? How can such a case be? If it was fit in twilight,
then it was fit for the whole Sabbath; and if it was not fit at
twilight, then it was not fit for the whole Sabbath?

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

He meant to say it was fit at twilight, but afterwards it got wet from
rain, and dried again, as it was in the beginning, and not fit during
one part of Sabbath., and then fit again. How is it? The answer was:
There is no law of Muktzah for a half of Sabbath. Shall we assume that
the above Boraitha, which declares that if it was born with a blemish it
shall be considered as prepared, is a support to Rabha's decree? Because
the first-born, when it was yet in the womb of its mother, was fit along
with its mother (because it was not reckoned a firstling before its
birth); and as soon as it is born, it is not fit; and after its being
examined by an expert and found blemished it becomes again fit (from
this we see that the law of Muktzah does not exist for a half of
Sabbath, as it was fit before its birth, became unfit at birth, and
became fit again after examination).

Nay, said Abayi in the name of R. Saphra: It may be that the case was,
the expert was by when it was born, and saw it was fit from its birth.

R. Jehudah the second possessed a firstling, and sent it to R. Ammi on a
festival for examination. At first he thought he would not examine it.
Said R. Zrika, or according to others R. Jeremiah, to him: If R. Simeon
and R. Jehudah differ, the Halakha prevails according to R. Jehudah.

At another time he sent it to R. Itz'hak of Naph'ha, and the same
happened again. Said R. Abba to R. Zrika: Why did not you let people do
a thing in accordance with R. Simeon? And he answered him: Have you
heard any decision that the Halakha is according to R. Simeon? And he
said: Yea, so I have heard from R. Zera. Said some one of the disciples
present: If I will be worthy to go to Palestine, I would like to learn
the Halakha from the mouth of R. Zera. Later when he came to Palestine,
he asked R. Zera: Did the Master say that the Halakha prevails according
to R. Simeon? And he answered: I did not say it is so, but I said: It
seems so to me, because the Mishna relates, R. Simeon said: If the
blemish was not recognized while it was yet day, it is not prepared, and
the Boraitha teaches the same in the name of the sages (in plural). And
I thought the Boraitha did so because the Halakha prevails accordingly.
How is it in reality? Said R. Joseph: Come and hear. I will base my
decision on the words of great men, that R. Simeon ben Pazzi in the name
of R. Joshuah b. Levi, quoting R. Jose b. Saul in the name of Rabbi,
upon the authority of the Holy Assembly of Jerusalem, said that R.
Simeon (b. Menasseh) and his colleagues

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

decide the above Halakha according to R. Meir. How can they have decided
it according to R. Meir? They lived (the Holy Assembly of Jerusalem) in
an earlier age than he. Say, they decided it in accordance with the
*system* of R. Meir (this will be explained in Tract B'choroth).

Ammi of Vardinaa was the examiner of the firstlings of the Nasi; and he
did not examine on festivals. When this was told to R. Ammi, he said, he
does right. Is it so? Did not R. Ammi himself examine the blemishes of
the firstlings? Nay, he used to see them the preceding day, but he kept
his decision until the morrow, when he asked the owner how the animal
had come by the blemish. As it happened when a man brought a firstling
before Rabha on the eve of a festival, after noon, and at that time
Rabha was washing his head. He raised his eyes, and looked on the
blemish, and told the man: Go away to-day, and come to-morrow. The next
day he asked him what was the cause of the blemish, and he answered: I
have given it barley on one side of thorns, and it was on the other
side; when it wanted to eat, it put forth its head between the thorns
and thus tore its lip. And Rabha asked him: Perhaps you did it
intentionally? And he said: No.

MISHNA: An animal which dies on the festival may not be removed thereon.
It happened once, when Rabbi Tarphon was questioned on the subject, and
also concerning a separate piece of dough, which had become polluted, he
went to the college and inquired. They told him: They may not be removed
from the spot.

GEMARA: Shall we say that this anonymous Mishna is not in accordance
with R. Simeon (see Sabbath, p. 375)? Nay, the Mishna can be explained
in accordance with him, but he owns that animals that died on Sabbath
are prohibited. This would be right according to Mar bar Amemar, who
said in the name of Rabh that R. Simeon owns it; but according to Mar b.
R. Joseph, who declares in the name of Rabha that R. Simeon differs,
even when the animals died on Sabbath, and said that they may be used?
(What can be said to that?) Zera explained this Mishna, that it refers
to an animal that was consecrated for sacrifice. And it seems Zera is
right in his explanation, because the Mishna speaks further on about
Hala that became unclean; and as the Hala was a consecrated thing, so
must be also the animal in question.

MISHNA: An association for the purpose of jointly purchasing

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

an animal may not be formed on the festival; but if this was arranged
before the festival, the animal so purchased may be slaughtered and
shared on the festival.

GEMARA: What is meant by "may not be formed"? Said R. Jehudah in the
name of Samuel: The price of the animal must not be fixed on the
festival; but how shall it be done? Said Rabh: Two animals shall be
brought, and placed side by side, and it shall be said: The value of
this animal shall be as the value of that. We have learned also in a
Boraitha: One shall not say to his neighbor: I will be a partner with
you in this animal for one Sela or more; but he may say: I would be a
partner with you for one half, third, or quarter of it.

MISHNA: R. Jehudah said: (A butcher who sells meat on a festival) may
weigh it against a vessel or hatchet; but according to the sages he may
not even look on the scales at all.

GEMARA: What is meant by "at all"? Said R. Jehudah in the name of
Samuel: Even to preserve the meat from mice, he must not put it on the
scales. Said R. Iddi bar Abbin: That is, when the scales hang on the
lever. R. Jehudah in the name of Samuel says again: A butcher who is a
specialist must not weigh the meat on his hand. He says again: The same
must not weigh the meat in water. R. Hyya bar Ashi said: It is not
permitted to make a hole in the meat, to use it as a handle. Said
Rabina: But if he made it with his hand, not with a tool, it is allowed.
R. Huna said: One may make a sign upon the meat, as Rabba bar R. Huna
would cut the meat in the shape of a triangle for a sign. R. Hyya and R.
Simeon the Great used to weigh one piece against the other, and they did
it according to R. Joshua, as we learn in the following Boraitha: R.
Joshua said: One may weigh one piece against the other. And R. Joseph
said: The Halakha prevails according to R. Joshua, because there is a
Mishna in Tract B'choroth in accordance with his decision.

MISHNA: Knives may not be ground or set on the festival; but it is
permitted to sharpen one knife with the other.

GEMARA: Said R. Huna: It is only on a whetstone, but on wood one may.
Said R. Jehudah in the name of Samuel: Even on a whetstone it is only
prohibited to sharpen, but to remove the fat from it one may. We may
infer from this, that on wood it is allowed even to sharpen.

Who is the Tana who holds that on a whetstone it is not permitted? Said
R. Hisda: It is at any rate not according to R.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Jehudah, as we
have learned in a Boraitha: R. Jehudah allows to make on a festival even
the arrangements for the preparation of food (Sabbath, p. 309).

Said Rabha to R. Hisda: Shall we lecture in thy name that the Halakha
prevails according to R. Jehudah? And R. Hisda answered: It may be the
will of the Lord that all good things like this shall ye lecture in my
name.

R. Nehemiah b. R. Joseph said: Once I was standing before Rabha, and saw
that he took the knife and made passes with it over a basket. And I said
to him: Does Master intend to sharpen it, or to remove the fat? And he
said: To remove the fat. But I saw that he intended to sharpen it. From
this it is understood that the Halakha prevails thus, but is not to be
proclaimed to the people. Abayi told that the same thing happened to him
and his Master, Rabba.

The schoolmen propound a question: May one give the slaughtering-knife
to the wise for examination on the festival? R. Mari the son of R. Bizna
allowed this, but the rabbis prohibited. R. Joseph, however, said: A
scholar (Talmud Hakham) may examine the knife for his own use, and then
lend it to others. R. Joseph said again: A knife that becomes blunt may
be sharpened by pressure, provided that the knife becomes only blunt,
but not injured.

R. Jehudah in the name of Samuel said: A spit that became crooked must
not be repaired on a festival. Is not this self-evident? He meant to
say, that even with the hand, without the aid of tools, it is not
allowed. The same says again: After the meat has been roasted on the
spit, it may not be handled more (because the blood defiling it makes it
unfit for use until cleaned). Said R. Adda bar Ah'bah in the name of R.
Malkiya: He may, nevertheless, take it to put into a corner, the same as
it is permitted to do with a thorn that is seen in public ground.
(Sabbath, p. 75.)

MISHNA: One must not say to a butcher: Give me meat for a Denar; but the
butcher may slaughter the animal, and divide it among the customers.

One may say to another (on the festival), fill me this vessel, but it
must not be a vessel appropriated to measure with. R. Jehudah says: If a
measure is used it must not be quite filled. Abba Saul b. Batnit used to
fill his measures on the day before the festival, and delivered them to
the customers on the festival. The same Saul said: One may do so even on
the intermediate

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

days, on account of the froth in the measure. The sages, however, say:
One may do so also on week-days in order to let out the entire contents
of his measure into the vessels of his customers.

GEMARA: What is meant by "vessel appropriated to measure with"? Said
Rabha: That is, he shall not mention the kind of measure, but if the
vessel is a measure he may do so. And R. Jehudah comes to teach that
even this must not be done. From this we see that, about the enjoyment
of the festival, R. Jehudah is more rigorous, and the sages are more
lenient; but did we not learn in the Mishna about the scales ([p.
55](#page_55).md), that R. Jehudah is more lenient and the sages are more
rigorous? And this would be a contradiction to that teaching? It
presents no difficulty. The above Mishna referred to a thing which was
not a weight, but this speaks of a vessel that is a measure. This
reconciles the contradiction between one teaching of R. Jehudah. and the
other. And as regards what sages teach about the scales? They merely say
that a man shall not do as is usually done on week-days, but here he
does not do as on week-days, because it is not usual that a man should
give wine to his guest to drink from a measure.

"*Abba Saul b. Batnit*," etc. A Boraitha taught: One may do it in the
intermediate days to prevent interruption in the house of learning (if
he will busy himself with the measuring, he will fail to go to the
college).

The rabbis taught: Abba Saul collected three hundred pitchers of wine
barely from the froth of the measures; <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) and his colleagues collected the same
amount from what remained in the measures after emptying them for the
customers. Both brought this wine to the treasurers of charity at
Jerusalem. The treasurers said to them: It is not necessary for you to
do so (because it is your own). But they replied: We do not wish to use
(because we do not consider it ours). And the treasurers rejoined: If
you are so rigorous towards yourselves, go and dispose of it for the

R. Hisda accompanied Rabbana Uqba, and the latter lectured: One must not
measure barley to give it to cattle; but one may nevertheless take a Kab
full, or two Kabs, and give it to the cattle without fear. But the baker
(cook) may measure the quantity of spices for putting into the pots,
lest he spoil the flavors.

R. Jeremiah bar Abba in the name of Rabh said: A woman may measure the
flour on a festival for her dough, for the purpose of separating a due
share of the first dough. Samuel, however, prohibited to do so. But did
not the disciples of Samuel teach in his name that it is allowed? Said
Abayi: Now, when the disciples declared in his name that it is
permitted, and from himself it was beard that it is not, we may assume
that he retracted his decision in order to teach us how to act.

The rabbis taught: One must not resieve flour on the festival; but R.
Papias and R. Jehudah b. Bthera both permit it. All agree, however, that
if some dust or a chip fell into the flour, that may be done. One
disciple taught in the presence of Rabina that if a chip has fallen into
it, he shall remove it with the hand. And Rabina rejoined that this is
by an *a fortiori* argument, not allowed, because it looks as though he
sifts it.

Rabha bar R. Huna the Minor lectured at the gate of Nehardai: One may
resieve flour on the festival. Said R. Na'hman to the people of
Nehardai: Go and tell Abba, Take thy favor and put it on the thorns
(*i.e.*, he did not any good with his lecture). Go and see how many
sieves are used in Nehardai on the festival (even before his lecture).

The wife of R. Joseph has sifted flour on the back of a sieve, and he
said to her: See, I want to have good bread (it means, you should not
make any change). The wife of R. Ashi sifted the flour on the back of
the table (to show a change from the week-days). Said R. Ashi: My wife
is the daughter of Rami bar Hama, who was very particular in his deeds,
and if she had not seen it done in the house of her father, she would
not do it.

MISHNA: One may go to a shopkeeper with whom one is used to deal, and
say to him: "Give me so many eggs or nuts," because the master of a
house is used to count similar articles by numbers.

GEMARA: The rabbis taught: One may go to his shepherd who is an
acquaintance, and ask him for one goat or one sheep; to his butcher, to
ask him for a shoulder or leg; to the birdseller, and ask him for one
old or young pigeon, to his baker, and

ask him for a loaf or roll; and to his grocer, and ask him for twenty
eggs or fifty nuts or ten peaches or five pomegranates or one
lemon--provided one does not mention any numbers of measures. R. Simeon
b. Elazar said: Provided one does not mention the prices.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[48:1](bet08.htm#fr_20.md) See Tract Pesachim, p.
171.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[48:2](bet08.htm#fr_21.md) This is explained in our
periodical "Hakol," also in our "Lebaker Mishpat," and we will touch
upon it in our present translation.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[51:1](bet08.htm#fr_22.md) Rabba's name was *Abba*,
and Rabba means Rab Abba. R. Na'hman as a colleague addresses him by
name.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[52:1](bet08.htm#fr_23.md) This name is mentioned
only once in the whole Babylonian Talmud. In the Palestinian Talmud,
however (Chap. I., Halakha 3) is mentioned R. Adda bar Uikhuma. The
different pronunciation of the two Talmuds is usual, and so this Amora
is the only one who was erratic. We are surprised why Zacuto and
Heilprin, in "Seder-Hadoroth," ascribed this to Adda bar Abhimi, who is
also mentioned only once in the whole Talmud. (In our edition, Vol.
III., p. 24, and in the old edition the same saying is repeated, 9 *b*
and 12 *a*), and there is not to be found even a hint that he was
erratic. Also in the Palestinian Talmud the same is mentioned twice
(Berakhoth, Chap. I., Halakha 3), with whom two great men of the
Amoraim, R. Tanhurn and R. Hezekiah, communicated. There it is also said
that he was a disciple of R. Zera (Zeera--according to the pronunciation
of the Palestinian Talmud). Why, then, should it be ascribed to such a
man that he was erratic? Moreover, Heilprin does not mention Adda bar
Ukhmi among the Amoraim at all, although he mentions his name in the
paragraph of Adda bar Abhimi, and gives also all our citation mentioned
above. We also do not know the sources from which Heilprin states that
according to others it is Abba bar Abhimi.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[57:1](bet08.htm#fr_24.md) Rashi explains thus: It
was known to him how many lugs there had been in his barrel, and also
how many he sold out to his customers, and the remainder which was in
the barrel he considered was left because of the froth of the measures,
and during the year it amounted to three hundred pitchers. And his
colleagues who sold oil, which makes no froth, collected the same number
from the remainder of the measures, as there is always some oil left in
them, and during many years they collected from this the same amount.
