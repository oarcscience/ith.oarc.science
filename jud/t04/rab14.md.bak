# CHAPTER XIV.

A. A cemetery must not be considered vilely; *e.g.*, no aqueduct may be
drawn through it, nor a path made; no cattle must feed there, nor may
one use it as a *compendiarius*, nor pick wood or grass therefrom. If he
has picked he must derive no benefit from it, and if he picked them only
to clean the grave, he must burn them on the same place.

B. Though inheritances are movable from place to place and changed from
one family to another, with graves, however, it is different; they are
not movable or changeable from one family to another. A new grave may be
measured, divided, and sold, but

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

not an old one; there is, however, a new one which must be considered as
old, and *vice versa*, namely: When there were in an old grave even ten
corpses, but were buried without the permission of the owner, it must be
considered as a new grave and may be measured, divided, and sold; if,
however, it was with his permission, even if it was a miscarriage, it
must be considered an old one, and nothing may be done with it.

C. No occupancy must be considered with the graves of the exiles;
*e.g.*, in time of a pest or war, the graves are not secured to the
corpses by occupancy. <span id="fr_133"></span>[C1](#fn_133.md) R. Simeon
b. Gamaliel said: Miscarriages do not acquire their graves, the same is
the case with all who are buried without the permission of the owner. A
woman who has inherited a grave, she and her offspring are to be buried
in it. Such is the decree of R. Meir; R. Jehudah, however, said: She,
but not her offspring; however, he owns that all her offspring who
existed during her life, may be buried with her. If her father requires
she should be buried in his grave, and her husband says in his, the
father has the preference; if she has children, then the husband has the
preference; if her will states that she shall be buried with her
children, it should be done so. If the father says she should be buried
with her husband, or *vice versa*, she is buried with her husband,
because it is his duty to feed, redeem, and bury her, and he must
provide all the necessaries, such as a hearse, flutes, and mourners, and
where an oration is held, he must provide also that. If he declines to
do all that, it is done by the court on his account against his will.

D. There are three kinds of graves: One that is found, <span
id="fr_134"></span>[D1](#fn_134.md) one that is known, and one which
injures the public. The first is permissible to vacate, and if it was
vacated, the place is clean, and a benefit may be derived from it; the
second is not permissible to vacate; if it was vacated, the place is
unclean, <span id="fr_135"></span>[D2](#fn_135.md) and no

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

benefit may be derived from it; and the third is permissible to vacate;
the place is clean, <span id="fr_136"></span>[D3](#fn_136.md) but no
benefit may be derived from it.

E. A cemetery which surrounds the city on three sides, must be vacated;
if on two sides, if they were opposite they can remain; if they were
joined, they must be removed. <span id="fr_137"></span>[E1](#fn_137.md) All
graves may be removed for the necessity of the community. R. Aqiba,
however, said: With the exception of those of a king and a prophet, as
there was the grave of the prophetess Huldah, in Jerusalem, and it was
never touched. His contemporaries rejoined: That is no proof, as there
was a cavern from the grave to the brook Kidron, which drew off the
uncleanness. <span id="fr_138"></span>[E2](#fn_138.md)

F. One who sells the graves of his family, (it is considered as if) he
did nothing. The same is the case if he sold the place of lamenting. The
rabbis taught: One who sold his grave, <span
id="fr_139"></span>[F1](#fn_139.md) the way to it, or standing-place, and
the house of lamenting, his family may come and reclaim them against his
will, because it is a disgrace to the family that they should be sold to
someone else.

G. The rabbis taught:  <span id="fr_140"></span>[G1](#fn_140.md)There must
be not less than seven standings and sittings after the burial, <span
id="fr_141"></span>[G2](#fn_141.md)to signify the seven times "vanity" is
mentioned in Ecclesiastes \[i. 2\]: "Vanity of vanities, saith Koheleth,
vanity of vanities: all is vanity." Said R. A'ha the son of Rabha to R.
Ashi: Explain me how they used to do, <span
id="fr_142"></span>[G3](#fn_142.md) and he rejoined: As we have learned in
the following Boraitha: R. Jehudah said: Formerly in Jehudah they have

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

made not less than seven standings and sittings for a dead body, and the
funeral director used to say: "Arise, dearests, arise!" and "Sit down,
dearests, sit down!" Said the sages to him: If that was all, let them do
so also on the Sabbath. <span id="fr_143"></span>[G4](#fn_143.md) The
sister of Rama bar Papa was the wife of R. Ivjah, and she died. He made
for her a standing and a sitting. Said R. Joseph: He has erred in two
things. First, this do only the relatives of the second degree, who are
not obliged to mourn, and he was one of the mourners; and, secondly,
this is to be done only on the day of burial, and he did so on the day
after. Said Abayi: He has also erred in this: It is usually done near
the cemetery, and he did this in the city. Said Rabha: He erred also in
this: It is only done where it is customary, and in his place it was not
customary at all. An objection was raised: It is said above that the
sages said to R. Jehudah: "If that was all, let them do also on the
Sabbath." Now if this is to be done only in the cemetery, and on the
first day, can this occur on Sabbath? The answer was, They meant to say,
in a city which is near the cemetery, and when the consolers returned
from the funeral which ended at twilight.

Whoever reminds a mourner of his dead after twelve months are over, is
to be blamed for renewing his wound. Said R. Simeon b. Gamaliel: One
whose wife died and has married again within a twelvemonth, one who
wishes to talk to him about his dead, shall do so in the market, but not
in his house.

All eatables may be brought to the house of a mourner-oval. shaped
bread, meat, and fish; and if an assembly does that, also herbs and
pulse. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Where it is customary, even
cooked food.

H. Ten goblets of wine have the sages ordered in the mourning house:
three before eating, to give an appetite; three during the meal, to
soften the food in the stomach, and four after the meal, for the four
blessings contained in the after-meal benediction. Afterwards they have
added four more: one for the sake of the sections of the city who have
occupied themselves with the burial; one for the sake of the presidents
of the congregations (for their advancing money for the sake of the
burial of the poor); one for the Temple (to console for its
destruction),

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

and one in memory of Rabban Gamaliel (who was the first to command to be
buried in linen garments, as said above). When the sages have seen that
they became drunk, they have restored the original number.

One who pronounces the meal benediction in the house of a mourner, what
shall he say in the fourth blessing? "The good One who does good to
all." R. Aqiba, however, said: "The truthful judge, the Ruler of His
creatures. O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good; because unto
eternity endureth His kindness." <span id="fr_144"></span>[H1](#fn_144.md)

### CHAPTER XIV.

C. The Hebrew term for occupancy is *Hazakah*, which means a
surety--that is, if the property is in the possession of one a long time
it is sure to be his, even if he has no documents for it.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[59:D1](rab14.htm#fr_134.md) *D*. It means that if
it was found that there was a corpse buried without the permission of
the owner, the place, after it is vacated, is considered clean, because
no precautionary measures were taken for such a one.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[59:D2](rab14.htm#fr_135.md) A precautionary
measure was taken to consider all graves unclean, even after their
vacation, lest one use the ground when they are not yet vacated.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[60:D3](rab14.htm#fr_136.md) *D*. For the sake of
the public, no precautionary measure is to be taken for this.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[60:E1](rab14.htm#fr_137.md) *E*. Taken from Tract
Nazir, Palestinian Talmud, as the Mishna here is very complicated, after
all the different corrections of the commentaries.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[60:E2](rab14.htm#fr_138.md) There is a law
concerning defilement, that a hole of one span which reaches the air
draws off the uncleanness. This will be explained in Tract Teharoth.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[60:F1](rab14.htm#fr_139.md) *F*. It was the
custom then that each family had cares for the purpose of burying there
the members of the family. The standing place means where the consolers
stood or sat after the burial, and it was near the grave, and there was
also a place where the lamenters stood.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[60:G1](rab14.htm#fr_140.md) *G*. Transferred from
Baba Bathra, 100*b*.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[60:G2](rab14.htm#fr_141.md) The custom was that
when they returned from the burial they used to walk a few steps and
then sit down and console the mourners or weep for the dead, and then
rise and go on; and to repeat this seven times, so that they should
remember the life of a human being is but vanity of vanities.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[60:G3](rab14.htm#fr_142.md) As in our place it is
not customary.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[61:G4](rab14.htm#fr_143.md) *G*. If that was all,
without lamentation, it could be done also on the Sabbath, if they
returned from burial on the eve of Sabbath at sunset.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[62:H1](rab14.htm#fr_144.md) *H*. This passage is
brought here at the conclusion of this tract, as it is usual to conclude
each tract with a good expression.

FESTIVALS.
