# CHAPTER II.

REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE ORDER OF PROCEDURE ON THE LAST SEVEN
FAST-DAYS, AND THE PRAYERS TO BE RECITED ON THOSE DAYS.

MISHNA: What is the order of procedure on the fast-days? The ark
containing the Holy Scrolls is to be brought into an open place in the
city, ashes of burnt substances are to be strewed on that ark, on the
head of the Nassi (prince), on the head of the chief of the Beth Din
(court of justice); and other persons shall also themselves strew ashes
on their heads. The eldest among them shall then address them in
heart-moving terms, as follows: "My brethren! Consider that it is not
written, anent the (repentance of the) Ninevites, that God regarded
their having wrapped themselves in sackcloth and considered their
fast-days, but that 'God saw their *works*, that they had turned from
their evil way' \[Jonah, iii. 10\], and the tradition of the prophets is
(as it is written): 'Rend your hearts, and not your garments'" \[Joel,
ii. 131.

After standing up to pray, the people shall place at the praying-desk,
to minister, an old experienced person who has children and whose larder
is empty, so that his mind may be entirely devoted to his prayer. This
person shall say twenty-four benedictions; namely, the eighteen
benedictions of the daily prayer, with the addition of six more, which
are as follows: The texts of Zikhronoth (remembrance of His creatures)
and of Shophroth (sounding of the cornet); the chapters \[Psalms, cxx.\]
"Unto the Lord, when I was in distress, did I call, and he hath answered
me"; \[ibid. cxxi.\] "I lift up my eyes unto the mountains," etc.;
\[ibid. cxxx.\] "Out of the depths have I called to thee, O Lord; and
\[ibid. cii.\] "A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed." R.
Jehudah said: It was not necessary to mention the Zikhronoth and
Shophroth, but the following passages are to be read instead, namely:
\[I Kings, viii. 37\]: "If there be famine in the land, if there be
pestilence," etc.; and \[Jeremiah, xiv.\] "The word of the Lord

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought"; and the concluding is
then added to each.

To the first he (the reader) shall say additionally: "May He who
answered Abraham on Mount Moriah answer you, and listen to your (prayer
and) cry on this day. Blessed art thou, O Lord, Redeemer of Israel!" To
the second he shall say: "May He who answered our ancestors on the Red
Sea answer you, and listen favorably unto your cry this day. Blessed art
thou, O Lord, who rememberest all things forgotten (by man)!" To the
third he shall say: "May He who answered Joshua in Gilgal answer you,
and listen to your cry this day. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who deignest
to listen to the sound of the cornet!" To the fourth he shall say: "May
He who answered Samuel in Mizpah answer you, and listen this day to your
cry. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hearkenest to (our) cry!" To the
fifth he shall say: "May he who answered Elijah on Mount Carmel answer
you, and listen favorably to your cry on this day. Blessed art thou, O
Lord, who hearkenest to prayer!" To the sixth he shall say: "May He who
answered Jonah in the bowels of the fish answer you, and listen unto
your cry this day. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who answerest in the time
of distress!" To the seventh he says: "May he who answered David and his
son Solomon in Jerusalem answer you, and listen unto your cry on this
day. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hast compassion on the earth!"

It happened in the days of R. Halaphta and R. Hanina the son of
Teradion, that a minister advanced to the praying-desk and completed the
entire benediction without any (of the congregation) answering thereto
"Amen." (The sexton then proclaimed): "Sound, priests! Sound!" (The
minister who said the prayers then continued): "May He who answered our
father Abraham on Mount Moriah answer you, and listen favorably to your
prayer this day." (The sexton then called): "Sound an alarm, sons of
Aaron! Sound an alarm!" (The previous minister continued): "May He who
answered our ancestors on the Red Sea answer you, and listen favorably
to your cry this day." When the sages were informed of this, they said:
"This was not our custom, except at the eastern door (of the Temple) and
on the Temple mount."

On the first three fasts, the priests who had the weekly watch of the
Temple fasted, but only part of the day, and the ministering priests did
not fast at all. On the second three fast-days, the

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

priests on the weekly watch fasted the whole day, but the ministering
priests only fasted part of the day; but on the last seven fast-days
both classes of priests fasted the whole day. So said R. Jehoshua. But
the sages say: "The first three fasts were not kept by either of the two
classes; on the second three fasts the priests on weekly watch would
fast part of the day, but the officiating priests would not fast at all.
On the last seven, however, the priests on the weekly watch would fast
the whole day; but the officiating priests would fast only part of the
day."

The priests having the weekly watch may drink wine at night, but not
during the day, <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) but the officiating
priests may drink it neither by day nor by night. The priests of the
weekly watch and the standing men (commoners attending the public
sacrifices as the representatives of the congregation at large) are not
allowed to shave their beards or to wash their clothes; but on Thursday
they are permitted to do so, in honor of the approaching Sabbath. (Moed
Katan, p. 25.)

Wherever it is mentioned in the "Roll of Fasts" that "no lamentation and
mourning is to be made" on certain days, it is also prohibited to do so
on the day preceding, but permitted on the day following. R. Jose,
however, says: "It is prohibited to do so on both the day preceding and
the day following." Where it is said, however, "No fasts are to be kept
thereon," it is allowed to fast on the day preceding and following days.
R. Jose, however, says: "It is prohibited on the preceding, but allowed
on the following day."

Public fasts must not be ordered to commence on a Thursday, in order not
to raise the price of victuals in the markets; <span
id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md) but the first three fasts must be kept on
Monday, Thursday, and the following Monday. But the second three fasts
may follow on Thursday, Monday, and the following Thursday. R. Jose
says: "Even as the first fasts are not to be commenced on Thursday, so
also are the second and last fasts not to commence on that day."

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

Public fasts are not to be ordered to take place on the feast of the New
Moon, on that of Dedication (Hanukah), nor on that of Lots (Purim); but
if the fast had already been commenced on one of those feasts, it need
not be broken. Such is the decree of Rabban Gamaliel. R. Meir, however,
says, that although Rabban Gamaliel said that the fast need not be
broken, he admits that on those days people are not to fast the entire
day. Such is also the case with the fast of the ninth of Abh, if it
happen to fall on a Friday.

GEMARA: "*What is the order of procedure on the fast-days*?" Does this
apply also to the first three fast-days? Then it would be a
contradiction to the following Boraitha: The first and the second three
fast-days they enter into the praying-house and pray as usual; but in
the last seven the ark is to be brought into an open place, etc. Said R.
Papa: "Nay; our Mishna also refers to the last seven."

"*On the head of the Nassi (prince)*"; and further, the Mishna teaches
that "other persons shall also strew ashes on their heads." This should
not be so! For did not Rabbi teach in a Boraitha that where an act of
honor is to be accomplished the most prominent persons are commenced
with, while when an act of humiliation is to be performed the lowest in
rank are first considered? The strewing of ashes on the heads of the
prince and of the chief of the Beth Din first is also an act of honor;
for they are told that they are more worthy of praying for mercy for us
and for all the world.

"*Other persons shall also strew ashes on their heads*." Why must the
prince and the chief of the Beth Din have someone else to strew ashes on
their heads? Can they not do so themselves? Said R. Abba (or Ada) of
Kisri: "The humiliation of disgracing one's self by one's own hands is
not equal to that of being disgraced by the hands of others (where
prominent persons are concerned, but as for common people it does not
matter)." On what part of the head are the ashes put? Said R. Itz'hak:
'On the place where the phylacteries are generally worn, as it is
written \[Isaiah, lxi. 3\]: 'To give unto them ornament in the place of
ashes,' implying that where ornaments (phylacteries) were worn ashes
were put."

Why do they congregate in an open place? Said R. Hyya bar Abba: "In
order that they might say: 'We have prayed privately and were not
answered, hence we shall humiliate ourselves by praying in public." And
Resh Lakish said: "In

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

order that they might say: 'We have been driven from our abodes, and may
our banishment be the means of our forgiveness.'" Why is the ark brought
into an open place? Said R. Jehoshua ben Levi: "In order that they might
say: 'We had a hidden treasure, but through our transgressions that also
has become profaned.'" Why do they clothe themselves in sackcloth? Said
R. Hyya bar Abba: "In order that they might say: 'We are now like the
beasts of the field.'" Why are ashes strewn on the ark? Said R. Jehudah
ben Pazi: "In order to say that this is an allusion to what is written
\[Psalms, xci. 15\]: 'With him I am in distress,' meaning that the
Shekhina shares the distress of the people." Resh Lakish said: "In order
to say that this is an allusion to the passage: 'In their affliction he
was afflicted.'" Said R. Zera: "When I saw the rabbis strew ashes on the
ark, my whole body trembled."

Why are ashes strewn on the heads of all? Concerning this, R. Levi bar
Hama and R. Hanina differ. One says that this is equal to saying: "We
are now before thee, O Lord, as ashes"; and the other says: "It is for
the purpose of begging the Lord to remember the ashes of Isaac." For
what purpose did they go out to the cemeteries? <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) Concerning this, R. Levi bar Hama and R.
Hanina also differ. One says, in order that they might say they were now
equal to the dead; while the other says that it was for the purpose of
having the souls of the departed pray for them.

Why was the Mount called Mount Moriah \[II Chronicles, iii. 1\]?
Concerning this there is again a difference between R. Levi bar Hama and
R. Hanina. One says that Moriah is the equivalent of Horaah (*i.e.*,
enactment), while the other says that Moriah is the equivalent of Mora
(fear); for when the Temple was built, other nations were awed.

"*In heart-moving terms*." The rabbis taught: If the eldest among them
was also a scholar he would address them; otherwise a scholar, even if
he was younger, would address them, and if there was no scholar among
them a prominent man would do it. And he would say to them: "Brethren!
It is not written, anent the repentance of the Ninevites, that God
regarded their having wrapped themselves in sackcloth and considered
their fast-days,

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

but that 'God saw their works, that they had turned from their evil
way'" \[Jonah, iii. 10\].

Concerning the Ninevites it is written \[Jonah, iii. 8\]: "But let man
and beast be covered with sackcloth." How was it done? They separated
the suckling animals from their mothers and said: "Sovereign of the
Universe! If Thou wilt not have mercy upon us, we will not have mercy
upon them." And further on: "Let men call unto God with might." What is
meant by "with might"? That means to say that they said: "Lord of the
Universe! Who of the two should give way unto the other? The oppressed
and the one who cannot be oppressed, the righteous and the wicked?"
(Now, as we are the oppressed and Thou canst not be oppressed, shouldst
Thou not overlook our iniquity?) Further, it is written \[ibid.\]: "And
let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence which
is in their hands." What is meant by "the violence which is in their
hands"? Said Samuel: "If a man had wrongfully appropriated a beam which
he had used in building a house, he would tear down the house and
restore the beam to its rightful owner."

R. Ada bar Ahabha said: "If a man confesses to a wrong committed, and
repents it without making proper restitution therefor, he is equal to a
man holding a dead reptile in his hands and bathing himself in order to
become clean; for, as a man who has a dead reptile in his hands, even
should he bathe in all the legal baths in the world, would not become
clean until he had rid himself of the reptile--but if he threw away that
unclean thing a bath measuring forty Saahs would cleanse him--so it is
with a man who had committed a wrong: unless he made proper restitution
all confession and repentance is in vain, as it is written \[Proverbs,
xxviii. 13\]: 'He that concealeth his transgressions will not prosper;
but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them will obtain mercy'; and as it is
written \[Lamentations, iii. 41\]: 'Let us lift up our heart and our
hands unto God in the heavens.'"

"*After standing up to pray*." The rabbis taught: At prayer, though
there be the eldest and a scholar present, neither should be placed at
the reading-desk unless they were experienced in prayer; but only one
who has had thorough experience. R. Jehudah said: "The minister should
be a man who has children and cannot provide for them, who works hard in
the field but has empty storehouses, who has good manners, who is
modest, who is popular, who has an attractive, sweet voice, who can read
the entire Holy Writ, and is competent to learn Midrash, Halakhoth,

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

and Haggadoth, and is conversant with all the benedictions." The rabbis
looked among themselves and cast their eyes upon R. Itz'hak bar Ami, who
had all those qualities.

(R. Jehudah said:) "'Who has children and cannot provide for them and
who has empty (store) houses.' Is that not one and the same thing?" Said
R. Hisda: "By an empty house is meant one free from sin." What is meant
by "good manners"? One who never had a bad reputation since his earliest
youth.

"*With the addition of six more*." Are there not seven additional
benedictions? as the Mishna states further on: "To the seventh he says,"
etc. Said R. Na'hman b. Itz'hak: By the seventh is meant the seventh to
the long benediction, as we have learned in a Boraitha: He says
twenty-four benedictions, namely: the eighteen benedictions of the daily
prayer, with the addition of six more, and those six are said between
the benediction of redemption and healing, and the benediction of the
redemption is made longer. After each benediction the congregation
answers "Amen." Such was the custom, however, only outside of the
Temple, but in the Temple the reader would say: "Blessed be the Lord the
God of Israel, from the beginning to the end of the world"; and they
would conclude by saying: "Blessed be the Redeemer of Israel." But no
"Amen" was answered; and why not? Because in the Temple it was not
allowed to answer "Amen." Whence do we deduce this? Because it is
written \[Nehemiah, ix. 5\]: "Arise, bless ye the Lord your God from
eternity to eternity. And let men bless thy glorious name, which is
exalted above all blessing and praise." This signifies, that after each
blessing the Lord's name should be praised (but not that "Amen" should
be said).

The rabbis taught: To the first benedictions the reader would say:
"Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel, from the beginning unto the end
of the world. Blessed be the Redeemer of Israel!" and the people
answered after him: "Praised be the name of the glory of His kingdom for
ever and ever." The Chazan (sexton) of the congregation then says:
"Sound, priests, sound!" The reader then continues: "May He who answered
Abraham on Mount Moriah answer you, and listen to your cry on this day."
The priests then sound, make an alarm, and sound again. To the second,
the reader says at the conclusion: "Blessed be the Lord, who remembereth
all things forgotten (by man)"; and the people answer: "Praised be the
name of the glory of His kingdom for ever and ever." The Chazan then
says: "Sound

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

an alarm, children of Aaron, sound an alarm!" The reader then says: "May
He who answered our ancestors on the Red Sea answer you, and listen
favorably unto your cry this day." The priests then make an alarm,
sound, and then make another alarm; and such is the manner of procedure
with everyone of the benedictions. The Chazan says alternately, "Sound!"
and "Sound an alarm!" until all the benedictions are said.

Thus did R. Halaphta proceed in Sepphoris and R. Hanina ben Teradon in
the city of Sikhni; and when the sages were informed of this, they said:
"This was not customary except at the eastern door of the Temple, and at
the Temple Mount."

"*R. Jehudah said: 'It was not necessary to mention the Zikhronoth,'*"
etc. Said R. Ada of Jaffa: "The reason of R. Jehudah's dictum is, that
the Zikhronoth and Shophroth are only mentioned on the New Year day, on
the day of the jubilee, and during times of war."

"*To the sixth . . . to the seventh he shall say*," etc. Let us see!
Jonah lived after the time of David and Solomon, why is he mentioned
first? Because he must conclude the benediction to the seventh with,
"Blessed be thou, O Lord, who hast compassion on the earth," therefore
he must mention Jonah first. We have learned in a Boraitha: It was said
upon the authority of Symmachos that instead of the benediction, "who
hast compassion on the earth," the benediction, "who makest humble those
that are arrogant," is said.

"*On the first three fasts, the priests*," etc. The rabbis taught: Why
was it said that the priests on the weekly watch were allowed to drink
wine at night and not during the day? Lest the officiating priests be
overwhelmed with work and those on the weekly watch would be required to
assist them. And why was it said that the officiating priests must not
drink either during the day or at night? Because they were compelled to
work day and night.

"*The priests of the weekly watch and the standing men*," etc. What was
the reason that they were not allowed to shave their beards? "In order
that they may not enter upon their duties while they are ugly to look
upon," said Rabba bar bar Hana in the name of R. Johanan. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md)

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

"*Wherever it is mentioned in the, Roll of Fasts*," etc. The rabbis
taught: It says in the "Roll of Fasts": These are the days on which
fasting is not permitted, and on some of them it is not even allowed to
mourn. From the first of Nissan on, until and including the eighth, on
which days it was resolved that the strife carried on between the
Pharisees and the Bathusees concerning the continual daily
offering <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) should be amicably
concluded by adopting the decree of the Pharisees, it was enacted that
no mourning or lamenting should be permitted; and from the eighth day of
Nissan until after the Passover festival it was established when the
feast of Pentecost should be celebrated, <span
id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md) and for that reason on those days no
mourning or lamenting is allowed.

The Master said: "From the first day of Nissan," etc. Why does he say
from the first? That is the day of the New Moon, and in itself a
feast-day when one must not mourn--why does he not say from the second
day of Nissan? Said Rabh: "He said 'from the first day of Nissan' so as
to provide that even on the day preceding that, one must not mourn." But
the first day of Nissan being a feast of the New Moon, it is
self-understood that on the preceding day one must not mourn; for such
is the law concerning all days preceding a feast-day! Nay; but the feast
of the New Moon is a biblical feast-day, and no additional measure need
be enacted to provide for its faithful observance; and mourning on a day
preceding a feast-day is only prohibited as a precautionary measure,
lest the mourning be continued on the feast-day itself. If the
feast-day, however, is a biblical one, such a measure is not necessary
and is only enacted for rabbinical feast-days.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

The Master said: "From the eighth day until after the festival," etc.
Why does he say "until after the festival"? Why not until the festival?
Surely one must not mourn on the festival itself! Said R. Papa: "In the
same manner as Rabh said, that the first day of Nissan is mentioned in
order to provide for the day preceding it as a day on which one must not
mourn, so in this case it says 'until after the festival' in order to
include the day following the festival among the days on which it is not
allowed to mourn; and this will be in accordance with the dictum of R.
Jose, who says in this Mishna 'that it is prohibited to mourn on both
the day preceding and following.'"

It was taught: R. Hyya bar Assi said in the name of Rabh that the
Halakha prevails according to R. Jose, and Samuel said that the Halakha
prevails according to R. Meir.

R. Na'hman ordained a fast-day on the thirteenth day of Nissan, and he
was reminded by the sages that that was the day of Torainos; but he
replied that the day of Torainos was abolished, for on that day Shmaia
and Ahia his brother were slain. Why was R. Na'hman reminded that the
day was that of Torainos, he could have been apprised of the fact that
it was the day before the feast of Nikanor? Said R. Ashi: "If the day
was abolished as the feast-day of Torainos, should it be kept as a
precautionary day for the observance of the day of Nikanor?"

What is Nikanor and what is Torainos? We have learned in a Boraitha:
Nikanor was one of the Greek viceroys, and every day he would lift up
his hand and vow that if ever Judea and Jerusalem came into his hands he
would crush them. After the Maccabees conquered him in battle, his
thumbs and big toes were cut off and hung up in the gates of Jerusalem,
and it was said that the mouth which had vowed against Jerusalem and the
hands which had been lifted up against it should be made to suffer.

What is Torainos? It was said: When Torainos desired to slay Lolainos
and his brother Papos in Ludkia (Lydda), he said to them: "If ye be of
the same nation as Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, let your God come and
save you from my hands as He did them from the hands of Nebuchadnezzar."
They answered: "Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were truly righteous men
and Nebuchadnezzar was a just king, deserving of being the means through
which a miracle was to be performed. But we have incurred the death
penalty before Heaven in any event, and if thou shouldst not slay us,
God has other agents who will

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

accomplish this--for instance, lions, bears, and other wild beasts who
could kill us; and thou art a wicked man, who art not worthy of having a
miracle occur through thee, and God hath given us into thy hands in
order to hold thee to account for our blood which thou wilt have shed."
Still, he had them executed, and it was said that he did not leave his
place before two envoys arrived from Rome, and his skull was split into
pieces.

"*Public fasts are not to be ordered*," etc. What is meant by "but if
the fast had already been commenced"? Said R. Aha: "If three fast-days
had already been kept"; and R. Assi said: "Even if one had been kept."

R. Jehudah said in the name of Rabh: All (of) this (clause of the
Mishna) is in accordance with the dictum of R. Meir in the name of
Rabban Gamaliel; but the sages said that one must complete his fast. Mar
Zutra went and preached in the name of R. Huna, that the Halakha
prevails that one must fast under those circumstances and, moreover,
complete the fast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_19"></span>[33:1](taa07.htm#fr_19.md) This regulation is a
general one and applies to ordinary days as well as to fast-days.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[33:2](taa07.htm#fr_20.md) Precautions were taken
in every instance to prevent exorbitant prices being charged for
victuals and at times even existing ordinances were abrogated for this
purpose. Thus no fast-days were ordered to commence on Thursday in order
that the dealers in articles of food might not take advantage of the
greater demand produced by the necessity of laying in an extra supply
for the day preceding the fast and for Sabbath.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[40:1](taa07.htm#fr_21.md) In the Palestinian
Talmud it is stated, in addition to what is taught in this Mishna, that
they would clothe themselves in sackcloth, go out to the cemeteries, and
sound the cornet.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[43:1](taa07.htm#fr_22.md) The proper time when
kings, officials, and the common people may shave their beards will be
explained and discussed in Tract Sanhedrin, and for that reason the
discussion pertaining thereto is here omitted.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[44:1](taa07.htm#fr_23.md) The strife carried on
between the Pharisees and the Bathusees concerning the continual daily
offering was as follows: The Bathusees maintained that because it is
written \[Numbers, xxviii. 4\]: "The one sheep shalt *thou* prepare in
the morning and the other sheep shalt *thou* prepare toward evening," it
is permitted for an individual to bring the continual daily offering,
while the Pharisees held that the offering must be brought by the
congregation from communal funds, basing their claim upon the passage
\[ibid. 2\]: "Shall *ye* observe," etc.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[44:2](taa07.htm#fr_24.md) The Pharisees and
Bathusees also disputed about the date when the feast of Pentecost was
to be celebrated, the latter claiming that as it is written \[Lev.
xxiii. 15\]: "And ye shall count unto you, from the morrow after the
Sabbath . . . seven complete weeks," the day of Pentecost must
necessarily fall on the first day of the week; but the Pharisees,
through R. Johanan ben Zakkai, maintained that the passage implies that
counting must be commenced on the day following the first day of the
festival, and therefore the feast of Pentecost would fall on the sixth
day of the month of Sivan.
