# CHAPTER IV.

A. For relatives of the first degree--*e.g.*, father, mother, son,
daughter, brother, wife, and sister--a priest may defile himself. R.
Aqiba said: For those of the second degree <span
id="fr_42"></span>[A1](#fn_42.md) he mourns and is prevented also from
services, which he must not perform when his dead is not buried; but he
must not defile himself.

B. R. Simeon b. Elazar, however, said: He may defile himself for his
grandfather and his grandson, but the sages <span
id="fr_43"></span>[B1](#fn_43.md) say: For whomsoever he is obliged to
perform all the ceremonies of mourning, are to mourn with him, but not
otherwise. If it was doubtful, however, whether the deceased was his
brother or son, or not, he mourns and is considered an Orvan, but he
must not defile himself.

C. For his betrothed he must neither mourn nor defile himself. The same
is the case with his divorced wife, although he has children by her.

The rabbis taught: Over all those of which it is written in the chapter
relating to priests \[Lev. xxi.\], that a priest may defile himself on
them, an ordinary person must mourn, and they are the following: wife,
father and mother, brother and sister, son and daughter. To these were
added: his brother and virgin sister by his mother, and his married
sister either by his mother or by his father. And also over all their
second degree of consanguinity. Such is the dictum of R. Aqiba. R.
Simeon b. Elazar, however, holds that it extends only to his grandson
and his grandfather. The sages, however, laid down the

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

following rule: "Over whom one is bound to mourn, *with* him he must
mourn." <span id="fr_44"></span>[C1](#fn_44.md) Does not the rule of the
sages state the same thing stated by the first Tana? There is a
difference as to those who are *with* him in the same house. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[C2](#fn_45.md) Rabh once said to Hyya his son, and so
also said R. Huna to Rabba his son: "In her (wife's) presence observe
mourning, but not in her absence." Mar Uqba's brother-in-law died, and
he was inclined to observe both the seven and the thirty days. When R.
Huna came to him and found him mourning, he said: "Dost thou desire to
partake of the mourning-meal? The rule that one must observe mourning
out of respect for his wife, extends only to father-in-law and
mother-in-law." We have also so learned in a Boraitha: "Ameimar's
grandson died, and he rent his garment. When subsequently his son
arrived he rent again in his presence, and when he afterwards
recollected that he was seated at the time he rent, he arose and rent
once more."

D. \[What is the term for Aninuth? <span id="fr_46"></span>[D1](#fn_46.md)
From the time of death till the interment, such is the dictum of R.
Meir. The sages, however, say: One day only.\] If a high-priest has
married a widow against the written Law; or an ordinary priest has
married a divorced woman, or one who has performed Halitzah, he may
mourn for her, and has to keep the term of Aninuth, but must not defile
himself.

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

E. For his sister, if she is betrothed, <span
id="fr_47"></span>[E1](#fn_47.md) R. Meir and R. Jehudah say he may defile
himself. R. Jose and R. Simeon hold that he must not. <span
id="fr_48"></span>[E2](#fn_48.md)

F. If he has married a virgin but without virginity, <span
id="fr_49"></span>[F1](#fn_49.md) according to R. Jose and R. Meir he
defiles, and according to R. Simeon he may not. If he has married a
forced <span id="fr_50"></span>[F2](#fn_50.md) or a seduced woman, all
agree that he may not. If he married a *vigaros*, <span
id="fr_51"></span>[F3](#fn_51.md) all agree that he may.

G. The general rule which R. Simeon laid down is: For every woman who
was fit for the high-priest when she was yet a virgin he may defile
himself, but not otherwise.

H. For all those of whom it was declared that a priest may defile
himself, it is not meant as a permission but as an obligation. So also
said R. Aqiba; R. Ishmael, however, said: It is meant as a
permission. <span id="fr_52"></span>[H1](#fn_52.md)

I. It happened to Joseph the priest that his wife died on the eve of
Passover, and he was reluctant to defile himself, so his colleagues
pushed him on her and defiled him against his will, saying: It is not a
permission but an obligation.

J. Until what time may he defile himself? R. Meir said: That whole day;
R. Jose said: Until three days; R. Jehudah in the name of R. Tarphon
says: Until the grave is closed.

K. It is related that when R. Simeon b. Jehozadok died at Lud, his
brother Johanan came from Galilee to defile himself with him, after the
grave was already closed. When the sages were asked about it they
decided: He must not defile himself; however, the grave may be opened to
enable him to see him.

L. It happened that a youth died and left his property to strangers, and
left out his family. His relatives complained,

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

and demanded an examination. <span id="fr_53"></span>[L1](#fn_53.md) When
the sages were asked, they decided not to do so, because as soon as the
grave is closed the corpse must not be moved. According to others: As
soon as one dies, his hair is changed. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[L2](#fn_54.md)

M. An ordinary priest who is defiling himself with relatives must not do
the same with a stranger, even at the same time, in case the stranger
has sufficient attendants; but if he has not he may defile himself, and
afterward retire to an undefiled place. The same is the case when he
begins, and others come to relieve him.

N. When there were two roads, one short but unclean and the other long
but clean, if the people went on the long one he should accompany them,
and if the people took the short road he should go with them, for the
honor of the people.

O. If he was engaged in burying his dead, so long as he is in the grave
he may receive from strangers for burial, but if he was out he must not
return.

P. If he has defiled himself on the same day, R. Tarphon makes him
culpable to a sin-offering, and R. Aqiba makes him free. All agree,
however, that he is culpable when he does so on the morrow, because he
has added one more day to be unclean, as he must count seven days after
the last defilement.

Q. A priest may defile himself for relatives even if they are not fit
for the priesthood; *e.g.*, for his son, daughter, <span
id="fr_55"></span>[Q1](#fn_55.md) brother or sister, begotten by a
temple-servant or bastard, except for those begotten by a slave or a
Gentile. <span id="fr_56"></span>[Q2](#fn_56.md)

R. A high-priest who defiles himself with the dead, or bares his head,
or rends his garments, is liable to the punishment of stripes.

S. For all uncleanness for which a Nazarite must shave off his hair, he
is liable to stripes; otherwise he is not.

T. A high-priest who enters a cemetery is liable to stripes.

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

U. If he enters the yard of a cemetery, or if he goes outside of
Palestine, he is liable to chastisement (rabbinically).

V. If he enters a field where there is a lost grave, he is not culpable
till he traverses every bit of it.

W. A priest may defile himself by going outside of Palestine to attend a
civil or criminal court; to sanctify the month; to intercalate the year,
and to save his field from the idolaters. He may bring a complaint and
sign it in their courts; however, he must first make a declaration that
he is going for this purpose.

X. He may also leave Palestine for the purpose of studying the Law, or
to get married. Said R. Jehudah: He may do the former when there is
nobody in the place to learn from; otherwise he may not. R. Jose,
however, said: Even if there is one to learn from he may do so, because
not everyone can teach. It happened to Joseph the priest that he went to
his master to study the Law; he went outside of Palestine to R. Jose in
Zaidin.

Y. A priest may defile himself with a piece of bone of his father's
body, even if it was as large as a grain of barley; R. Jehudah, however,
said: He must not. A priest must not defile himself with a limb cut off
a living body, be it even that of his father. <span
id="fr_57"></span>[Y1](#fn_57.md)

Z. It happened to Joseph Parkass that he had an abscess on his foot, and
the surgeon came to cut it off. He said to him: If thou wilt leave of it
a bit of the size of a hair, let me know. When the surgeon told him that
he did so, he summoned his son Nehemiah and said: My son, till here thou
art obliged to attend me, but no farther. For the sages said: One must
not defile himself for a limb cut off a living body, be it even that of
his father. When the sages heard of it, they said: The following
passage: "My life is in my hand continually, yet thy Law do I not
forget." \[Ps. cxix. 109\], applies to him; and also: "There is many a
righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness" \[Prov. vii. 15\].

AA. If he was on the road and he found a Meth-Mitzvah, <span
id="fr_58"></span>[AA1](#fn_58.md)

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

he is obliged to attend to it. What is to be considered such? If he
would call for help and his cry could not be heard in the nearest town;
but when it is heard, it is not considered as such (and he must not
defile himself).

BB. It is always considered a Meth-Mitzvah unless there are sufficient
people to attend to its funeral.

CC\. If there was a high-priest and a Nazarite, the high-priest shall
defile himself but not the Nazarite, according to R. Eliezer; for the
latter must bring an offer for his defilement, and the former not. The
sages, however, say: Rather let the Nazarite bring a hundred offers than
cause defilement even to an ordinary priest; because the sanctification
of the priest is from birth and forever, and the Nazarite's is only
temporary.

DD. All agree that if there was an anointed high-priest and an
unanointed one who is recognized only by his many garments, <span
id="fr_59"></span>[DD1](#fn_59.md) the latter must defile himself and not
the former; when there was the latter and an overseer, or an overseer
and an ex-overseer, or an ex-overseer and a priest anointed for the war,
or he and a common priest, or a common priest and a Levite, or he and an
Israelite, the second of each pair always must defile himself but not
the first. If both are equals, the quickest of the two must do so; and
if both are quick, the one that expresses the desire shall do so.

EE. If it was found between a ploughed and an abandoned field, it shall
be buried in the latter; between a ploughed and a sown field, it shall
be buried in the former; between a sown field and an orchard, or an
orchard and a field in which *persea* grows,

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

it shall be buried in the former. If both places are equal in value, it
shall be buried in the nearest one; and if they are equal in distance,
it can be buried wherever desirable.

FF. Said R. Aqiba: "The following incident was the commencement of my
reward to be counted among the wise. I once arose early and found a
slain body. I burdened myself with it for three legal limits of the
Sabbath, until I brought it to a cemetery, and I buried it. When I
related this to the sages, they told me that my every step was
considered as if I had shed blood. <span id="fr_60"></span>[FF1](#fn_60.md)
Whereupon I drew the following *a fortiori* conclusion: When, having in
view to perform a meritorious deed, I have transgressed so much, how
much the more would I have sinned if I had had no such intention!"
Whenever R. Aqiba was reminded of this incident he said: This was the
commencement of my reward. <span id="fr_61"></span>[FF2](#fn_61.md)

### CHAPTER IV.

A. Grandfather, grandmother, grandson, etc.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[12:B1](rab04.htm#fr_43.md) *B*. The sages differ
with R. Aqiba, who says: That for the second degree he must not mourn at
all, and it is to be understood so: Whoever is obliged to perform all
the mourning ceremonies, *e.g.*, not to sit in a chair, not to put on
the shoes, etc., which are customary for the first degree, then also the
priest must mourn and defile himself; but for the second degree, for
whom he is not allowed to defile himself, the mourning is also
unnecessary for him. The case where mourning without defilement can be
found is only when it is doubtful, the doubtfulness meaning when the
woman who bore the child was suspected.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[13:C1](rab04.htm#fr_44.md) *C*. *E.g.*, for a
father for whom one is bound to mourn, if the father mourns for his
father, the son may mourn with him. The same is the case with a son for
whom the father is bound to mourn, if the son mourns for his son the
father mourns with him. (Rashi.)

<span id="fn_45"></span>[13:C2](rab04.htm#fr_45.md) It means that according
to the sages the grandfather or the grandson is bound to mourn only when
the father or the son is mourning in the house. (Rashi.)

<span id="fn_46"></span>[13:D1](rab04.htm#fr_46.md) *D*. The term "Onen" in
the Talmud means one of the relatives of the deceased, just after he
departed and before the burial. It is derived from Genesis \[xxxv. 18\]:
"Ben Oni." (See Leeser's translation, who did not translate *Ben Oni*,
but inserted the words as written. He nevertheless translates Deut.
xxvi. 14: "I have not eaten thereof in my mourning," the Hebrew term for
which is the same, which is surprising.) The law of an Onen is, that
only the high-priest may perform his service when a death occurs in his
family; an ordinary priest, however, must not; and if he does, he
violates the law. Hence is the question here, how long the term of
Aninuth must be kept. According to R. Meir, even if there are several
days from death to interment, the entire law of it must be observed; but
according to the sages only one day, as it is explained elsewhere--from
morning till evening.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[14:E1](rab04.htm#fr_47.md) *E*. The high-priest.
See Lev. xxi. 3. When she, however, is not married, but betrothed; hence
the difference of opinion.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[14:E2](rab04.htm#fr_48.md) The names are corrected
according to Tract Jebamoth, p. 60.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[14:F1](rab04.htm#fr_49.md) *F*. Without
virginity--through sickness, or she has lost it through something else;
and according to the sages, the high-priest was not allowed to marry one
who had lost her virginity, whatever the reason.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[14:F2](rab04.htm#fr_50.md) Forced--Deut. xxii. 28.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[14:F3](rab04.htm#fr_51.md) *Vigaros*, also without
virginity, but only through age; therefore all agree that in marrying
her he does not commit any transgression, as he himself could not know
it.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[14:H1](rab04.htm#fr_52.md) *H*. See Elias Wilna.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[15:L1](rab04.htm#fr_53.md) *L*. If he was of age
to make a will.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[15:L2](rab04.htm#fr_54.md) It is difficult to
understand the real meaning of it. It seems to us that it means that the
examination of the hair could decide nothing, as it could have grown
after the death.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[15:Q1](rab04.htm#fr_55.md) *Q*. If they were born
by a woman whom he married unlawfully.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[15:Q2](rab04.htm#fr_56.md) According to the
Talmud, an illegitimate child begotten by parents of two different
creeds without being married, must be considered according to the creed
of the mother; hence they are not his children.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[16:Y1](rab04.htm#fr_57.md) *Y*. The law is, if a
whole limb was separated from a living body it is a subject of
defilement; but if flesh was separated from that limb, even if it was
more than the size of an olive, it is not. However, when the limb was
separated from a corpse, and flesh separated from it the size of an
olive, it defiles.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[16:AA1](rab04.htm#fr_58.md) *AA*. This expression
is used in the whole Talmud about one who died without relatives, or if
he died somewhere far from them, or in a lonely place. "Meth" means a
corpse, "Mitzvah" means a commandment, and together they express: A
corpse which anybody who finds is commanded to attend to its burial.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[17:DD1](rab04.htm#fr_59.md) *DD*. There is a
tradition that in the time of King Josiah the oil of anointment made by
Moses was concealed, and from that time the ascent of a high-priest was
made only with his prescribed garments, and in the Talmud such a
high-priest was called by the name of "who was known by his many
garments." Hence if it happened that an anointed ex-high-priest were in
company with a high-priest who was elected after the oil of anointment,
was concealed, the latter, though he is a high-priest, must defile
himself, because his degree in sanctification is considered lower than
that of the former; and so is it with all the pairs--the second is lower
in sanctification than the first.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[18:FF1](rab04.htm#fr_60.md) *FF*. Because the law
is that it must be buried on the place where it is found.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[18:FF2](rab04.htm#fr_61.md) *I.e.*, From the
answer of the sages he learned that he knew nothing of the Law, and he
began to study until he reached his eminence.
