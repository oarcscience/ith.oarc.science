# TRACT SUCCAH.

## CHAPTER I.

REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE BUILDING OF A LEGAL BOOTH FOR THE FEAST OF
TABERNACLES, ITS WALLS, AND ROOFING.

MISHNA: A booth which is higher than twenty ells is not valid. R.
Jehudah, however, says it is. One which is not ten spans high, one which
has not three walls, or which has more sun than shade, is not
valid. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)

GEMARA: Whence do we deduce this? Said Rabha: It is written \[Lev.
xxiii. 43\]: "In order that your generations may know that I caused the
children of Israel to dwell in booths." Up to twenty ells a man knows
that he is living in a booth, but higher than twenty ells he does not
know, because his eyes do not frequently perceive the roof. R. Zera
said: From the following passage \[Isa. iv. 6\]: "And a tabernacle shall
it be for a shade in the daytime from the heat." Up to twenty ells a man
sits in the shade of the roof, but if it is higher than twenty ells a
man sits in the shade of the walls (but not of the roof). Said Abayi to
him: According to your theory, if one has made a booth between two
hills, it is also not legal (because there is no shadow from the roof at
all)? And he answered: What comparison is this? if the hills were
removed, he would sit in the shadow of the roof; but here, if the walls
would be taken away, there would be no shade at all. Rabha said: From
the following passage \[Lev. xxiii. 42\]: "In booths shall ye dwell
seven days." The Law commands that for seven days one shall remove from
his permanent dwelling into a temporary dwelling. Up to twenty ells,
ordinarily a man makes a temporary dwelling; but higher than this it is
not usual to make a temporary dwelling. Said Abayi to him: According to
you, if one has

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

made iron walls, and covered them with a legal roof, would it also be
unlawful for a booth? Rabha answered: I mean to say this: Up to twenty
ells, which is an ordinary height for a temporary dwelling, even if one
makes it a permanent dwelling, he can fulfil his duty; but over twenty
ells, which is the ordinary height only of a permanent dwelling, even if
one has made it a temporary dwelling, it is also unlawful? According to
whom is the following saying of R. Joshia in the name of Rabh: The sages
and R. Jehudah differ only when the walls do not reach the roof; but if
the walls do reach the roof, all agree that the booth is valid though
the walls be higher than twenty ells? It is in accordance with Rabha,
who says that the sages make it invalid because the eye cannot reach the
roof; but when the walls are attached to the roof, the eye is able to do
so.

According to whom would the following saying of R. Hannan in the name of
Rabh be: that they differ only about a booth less than four ells square,
but when it is four ells square all agree that it is valid? This is in
accordance with R. Zera, who says: The rabbis make it unlawful because
of the lack of shadow, and in a booth four ells square there is a
shadow. And according to whom is the following saying of R. Harman b.
Rabha in the name of Rabha: They (the sages and R. Jehudah) differ when
the booth is only of a size to accommodate a man's head and greater part
of body, and his table; but if it is of a larger size, then if it is
higher than twenty ells, is it also valid? It is not, according to any
one. An objection was raised: We have learned in a Boraitha: A booth
which is higher than twenty ells is not valid. R. Jehudah, however,
makes it valid, even if its height is forty or fifty ells; and he said:
It happened that the Queen Helen, in the city of Lud, was sitting in a
booth which was higher than twenty ells, and the older sages were
entering and going out of it, and they did not object. And the sages
answered him: This is not proof. She was a woman, and it is not
obligatory for a woman to sit in a booth at all. And he rejoined:
Everybody knows that she had seven male children; and besides this, all
her acts were only in accordance with the will of the sages.

Now, it is right according to him who said that they differ in a case
where the walls of the booth do not reach the roof, because usually a
queen is sitting in a booth whereof the walls reach not the roof, that
air may come in; but according to him who said that even in case of a
small booth they differ, is it customary that a queen should sit in a
small booth? Said Rabba bar R. Adda:

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The case was of a
booth separated into chambers. But is it customary that a queen should
sit in a booth separated into chambers? Said R. Ashi: Yea, the case was
that of a large booth with chambers, and the sages differ about the
chambers. They hold that she sat in a separate chamber, but her children
were sitting in a lawful booth, and therefore the elders did not object;
but R. Jehudah said, her children sat with her, and nevertheless they
did not object.

R. Samuel bar Itz'hak said: The Halakha prevails that the booth must be
large enough to accommodate the head, the greater part of the body, and
a table. Said R. Abha to him: According to whose opinion is this? And he
answered: It is according to Beth Shammai, and nevertheless one shall
not deviate from this law. R. Na'hman bar Itz'hak opposed this: Where do
you find that Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel differ about a small booth?
Perhaps they differ about a large booth, and the case was that the man
was sitting at the entrance of the booth, and the table was in the
house. Beth Shammai prohibit this as a precautionary measure, lest he
incline himself toward the table, and then he will not be sitting in the
Succah at all, and Beth Hillel does not call for such a precautionary
measure. And a support to this I can bring from the following Boraitha:
If one whose head and greater part of body was in the booth, and his
table was in the house, Beth Shammai say it is not lawful, and according
to Beth Hillel it is. Now, if they differed about the size of the booth,
it should be said: if one sat in a booth which cannot contain more than
the head and greater part of the body. And another Boraitha stated that
Rabbi says if a booth does not contain four ells square it is invalid;
but the sages say, if it contains the space for the head and the greater
part of the body it is valid? Nay, they differ in both cases, and the
Boraitha is not complete, and must be read thus: if one was sitting with
his head and greater part of his body in the booth, and the table was in
the house, he did not fulfil his duty, according to Beth Shammai; but
Beth Hillel say he did, and a booth which cannot contain more than the
greater part of the body and the head is unlawful, according to Beth
Shammai; but Beth Hillel say it is.

Who is the Tana of the following teaching of the rabbis: In a house
which is not four ells square, it is not obligatory to have a Mezuzah (a
battlement), <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) and it is not subject to
being defiled

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

by plagues, and it is retained at the jubilee year in a fortified town
\[Lev. xxv. 29\], and a man possessing such a new house must not be kept
from going to war, and an Erub must not be made in it, and it is not
counted as a house to combine with the houses of the alley, and an Erub
(from the courts) must not be deposited in it, and it must not be
regarded as a house on the border between two towns, and brothers and
partners do not divide it? Shall we assume it is according to Rabbi, not
the sages? Nay, we can say that it is in accordance even with the sages.
Do the sages allow a dwelling of less than this size? Only when it is a
Succah which is temporary; but a house which is a permanent dwelling
even the sages agree must be at least four ells square. Then men can
live in it; but if less, it is not called a house at all.

If the booth was higher than twenty ells, and one put in pillows and
feather-beds, it is not considered as made lower thereby; even when he
renounces their use for any other purposes, because we ignore his
resolve, as people in general do not do it. But if one puts there straw,
and renounces it, it is considered as made lower; and so much the more,
loose earth. But if one puts there straw which he does not renounce,
although he does not purpose to remove it, and also sand, which he does
not renounce--in that case Jose and the sages differ (Tract Ahaloth,
Chap. xv. 6). If the booth was higher than twenty ells, and from the
roofing hung down small twigs, then if they are so numerous that there
is more shadow than sunshine, they are considered to make it lower; but
if less than that, they do not make it lower. If it was high only ten
spans, and small twigs hung down from the roof, Abayi thought that if
there was more sun than shadow between the twigs, it m-as valid. Said
Rabha to him: It is an unendurable dwelling, and nobody would live in
it. (Therefore it is not valid.)

If it was higher than twenty ells, and one constructed in it a bench
along the whole middle wall, if the bench is as large as the legal size
of a booth (seven spans and a trifle), then the booth is valid (the
whole booth because of a crooked wall); but if he constructed a bench
along a side-wall, if from the edge of the bench to the opposite wall it
is four ells, it is not valid; but if less than this, it is valid
(because the bench legalizes two walls, the third being without the
legal limit). If he constructed a bench in the midst of the booth, if
from the edge of the bench to each of the walls it is four ells, it is
not valid; but if less, it is valid, because of a crooked wall on all
sides. If, however, he put the bench on

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

one side, then if it is less than four ells of the wall, it is valid
(because of a crooked wall on one side); but if it is four ells, it is
not. If the booth was less than ten spans in height, and he dug in it a
pit to make it ten spans high, if from the edge of this pit to the wall
is three spans, it is invalid; but less than that, it is valid. Why,
then, in the case when it is twenty ells high, are less than four ells
needed to make it valid, while here, when it is ten spans high, less
than three spans are needed? Because there a wall is in existence, and
to make it invalid one must have four ells; but in the case of ten
spans, the wall is not considered a wall at all, and to make it a wall
less than three spans are wanted (because then it is Lavud, *i.e.*,
considered as attached to the ground of the pit when it would be ten
spans high). (See Sabbath, p. 12, note §.)

The rabbis taught: If one has placed four poles and roofed them,
according to R. Jacob, it is valid in cases when the poles admit of
partition, as will be explained further, for a booth, but according to
the sages it is invalid. Said R. Huna: They differ only about the edge
of the roof. R. Jacob holds the theory of Gud Assik (see Erubin, note,
p. 6) applies here, and the sages hold that it does not. But about the
middle of the roof they all agree it is invalid. R. Na'hman, however,
said: They differ even about the middle of the roof. The schoolmen
propounded a question: Does R. Na'hman mean to say they differ about the
middle, but about the sides all agree that it is valid? Or does he mean
to say, they differ even about the middle? This question is not decided.

The rabbis taught: If one drove into the ground four poles and roofed
them, R. Jacob said, it should be seen whether each of the poles is so
thick that if it would be divided it would reach a span on each side
(see illustration of enclosures, Erubin, p. 18), then they must be
considered as enclosures and the booth is valid; but if they have not
such a thickness, it is not valid. And this is according to his theory
elsewhere, that the enclosures of a booth must be not less than a span
at each side. But the sages said, the booth is not valid unless there
are two walls as usually; and the third wall is sufficient, even if it
is one span.

"*If less than ten spans*." Whence is this deduced? It was taught: Rabh
and Mar Hanina, R. Johanan and R. Habiba, taught

\[in the whole section of Moed, whenever these names are mentioned, they
put R. Jonathan in the place of R. Johanan\], the ark was nine spans,
and the cover to it one span, together it is

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

ten. As it is written \[Ex. xxv. 22\]: "And I will meet with thee there,
and I will speak with thee from above the cover." And we have learned in
another Boraitha: R. Jose said that the Shekhina never descended, and
Moses and Elijah never ascended the heaven. As it is written \[Psalms,
cxv. 16\]: "The heavens are the heavens of the Lord, but the earth hath
he given to the children of man"; but is it not written \[Ex. xix. 20\]:
"And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai"? And the answer is, that He
did not come down lower than ten spans <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)
from the ground. (Now, when He says, "I will speak to thee from above
the cover," that means ten spans higher. From this we see that ten spans
are counted as separate premises; hence ten spans is the minimum height
of a dwelling.)

It is true, the ark is nine spans, because it is written \[Ex. xxv.
10\]: "And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two ells and a half
shall be its length, and one ell and a half its breadth, and an ell and
a half its height" (and as an ell is six spans, the height of one and a
half is nine spans). But where do we find that the cover is one span?
From the teaching of R. Hanina as follows: Of all the utensils that
Moses made, the Law had prescribed before the length, the breadth, and
the height. In case of the cover, however, the length and the breadth
are written, but not the height; and we must go and draw this lesson
from the meanest of the utensils, as it is written \[ibid., ibid. 25\]:
"And thou shalt make unto it a rim of a hand's breadth round about." As
the height of the rim is a span, we infer that the height of the cover
is also a span. But why from the meanest of the utensils--why not from
the utensils themselves? Because there is a rule, when much is grasped
at, nothing is grasped; but when little is grasped, it is retained. R.
Huna said: We infer it from this passage \[Lev. xvi. 14\]: "On the face
of the cover, eastward"; if less than a span, it would not be called
face. But where do we find that the distance between the roof and ground
should be ten spans? Perhaps the roof itself should be included?
Therefore we say this theory they draw from the Temple; as it is written
\[in I Kings, vi. 2\]: "And the house which King Solomon built unto the
Lord was sixty ells in length, and twenty in breadth, and thirty ells in
height"; and \[ibid., ibid. 26\]: "The height of the one cherub was ten
cubits, and so was the other"; and a Boraitha states, as

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

we have found in the Temple, that the cherubim were a third of the
height of the house, so also in the tabernacle in the desert they were
one-third. Now, the height of the tabernacle was ten ells, as it is
written \[Ex. xxvi. 16\]: "Ten ells shall be the length of each board."
How many spans are in ten ells? Sixty. A third thereof is twenty: take
off ten, which was the height of the ark with the cover, ten is left.
And it is written \[ibid. xxv. 20\]: "And the cherubim shall spread
forth their wings on high, overshadowing the cover." Hence we see that
the Torah calls "overshadowing" when above ten spans. Therefore we infer
that the roofing overshadowing the booth must be above the ten spans.

This would be right according to R. Meir, who said that all the ells
mentioned in the Torah measure six spans; but according to R. Jehudah,
who says that the ells of a building measured six spans, but other ells
only five spans, what can be said? If so, the ark with its cover would
be only eight and a half: then remain for the cherubim eleven and a
half. Shall we say that the booth must be high at least eleven and a
half? According to R. Jehudah the size of a booth is (Sinaic). (As it is
said in Tract Erubin, p. 5)

"*One which has not three walls*." The rabbis taught: Two walls must be
as usually, but the third one may be even one span. R. Simeon, however,
said: Three must be as usually, and the fourth one may be a span. In
what point do they differ? The rabbis hold, the bases are the Massorah
(*i.e.*, if we came to draw something from Scripture the basis must be
the Massorah) and as \[in Lev. xxiii.\] "in booths" is mentioned three
times, and the Hebrew term for this is ‏בסכת‎, ‏בסכת‎, ‏בסוכות‎; <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) that is, two of them are written in the
singular and one in plural, and from each term in the singular we infer
the necessity of one wall, and from the term in the plural two, which
make four: take off one expression intended as a commandment to make
booths in general, we infer from the two which are superfluous the
necessity of three walls; that is, two as usually, and the third one the
tradition reduces to a span in case it is valid. But according to R.
Simeon the basis must be the biblical words as they *read*; and as all
three *read* in the plural, we infer the necessity of six walls: take
off one term as a general commandment, we have left four; hence three
must be as usually, and the fourth tradition reduces to one span. And if
you wish, we will say: that all

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

agree that the basis must be the Massorah, but the point whereon they
differ is, one holds that the first verse, where the commandment is
written, we also take into consideration to infer the necessity of a
wall--consequently it is four walls; and one holds that the first must
not be taken into consideration, and it is only three. R. Mathua said:
R. Simeon infers his theory from the following passage \[Isa. iv. 6\]:
"And a tabernacle shall it be for a shadow in the daytime from the heat,
and for a refuge, for a covert from tempest and from rain" (*i.e.*, if
it is not three walls, it cannot be a protection from wind, etc.).

Where shall be placed the wall which is one span wide? Said Rabh: One
may place it where one wall ends, no matter which; it was taught that
the same was said by Samuel in the name of Levi, and so also it was
decided in the college. R. Simon, and according to others R. Joshuah b.
Levi, said: The wall which is a span shall be wide as a span made by the
palm when extended, and one shall place it at a distance of less than
three spans from another wall, so that the theory of Lavud should apply.

R. Jehudah said: A booth that was made as an entry is valid (the two
walls need not be adjacent, but may be opposite, while the wall of one
span can be placed at any side one likes). R. Simeon, and according to
others R. Joshuah b. Levi, said: Such a booth is lawful only when one
places an enclosure four spans and a trifle wide, and at a distance of
less than three spans from the wall, so that the theory of Lavud can
apply: then it will be counted together seven spans and a trifle, which
is the lawful width for a booth. Why is it said there that it is
sufficient when it is wide as an extended span, and here that an
enclosure of four spans is needed? There, where there were two walls, as
usually, a span is enough; but here, in which case they are opposite, an
enclosure of at least four spans is required. Said Rabha: And to it must
be added an appearance of a door (on the other side). R. Ashi found R.
Kahna, who made a third wall extended a span wide, and on the other side
an appearance of a door; and he said to him: Does not the Master hold
with Rabha, who said that an appearance of a door is sufficient for a
third wall? And he answered: I hold with the saying of Rabha, as it is
interpreted above, that an appearance of a door must be added too.

Again: "*Two walls as usually*," etc. Said Rabha: This booth is
considered private ground in reference to a Sabbath falling in the Feast
of Tabernacles, so that things may be carried

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

from another private ground into this booth, and *vice versa* (although
for a legal private ground three walls are needed), because as the two
walls are considered a Succah, it is considered also private ground for
this Sabbath. Rabha said again: If one has made a roof above an entry
which has a side-beam, it is valid for a booth. <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) And the same said again: If one has roofed
the enclosure of a w ell (see illustration in Erubin, p. 18), it may be
used as a booth.

"*If there is more sun than shadow, it is not valid*." The rabbis
taught: If there is more sunshine than shadow from the roof, but not
from the walls. R. Joshiah, however, said: Even if it is more sunshine
from the walls, it is also invalid. Said R. Yemar bar Shlomiah in the
name of Abayi: What is the reason of R. Joshiah's decree? Because it is
written \[ Ex. xl. 3\]: "Thou shalt cover the ark with a vail"; now the
vail was a partition, and the Torah says: "Thou shalt cover with it"; we
may infer from this, the partition shall be equal in law to the cover
(or roof). And what will the rabbis say to the query of R. Joshiah? The
rabbis explained the expression, "Thou shalt cover it," that it means he
shall fold the vail a little towards the ark, so that it shall seem as a
cover.

Abayi said: Rabbi, R. Joshiah, R. Jehudah, R. Simeon, and Rabban
Gamaliel, the school of Shammai, R. Eliezer, and the anonymous teachers
all hold that a booth must be considered not as a temporary but as a
permanent dwelling. (Rashi explains that it means that it should be
possible to turn it into a permanent dwelling.) Rabbi, as we have
learned above, that a Succah that was not four ells square is invalid;
R. Joshiah, from the statement just mentioned; R. Jehudah, as he
declares valid a booth which is higher than twenty ells; R. Simeon, as
he requires four walls (three as usually, and one, one span wide);
Rabban Gamaliel, as he declares invalid (farther on) a booth constructed
on board a vessel or on a wagon; Beth Shammai, as they declare in a
Mishna, farther on, that it is invalid if it can contain a man's head
and greater part of body, while his table is in a house; R. Eliezer, as
he declared a Succah constructed in the shape of a pyramid is invalid;
and the anonymous teachers, who declare invalid a circular Succah.

R. Johanan said: A booth which is made like a lime-kiln (*i.e.*, round),
if its circumference is large enough that twenty-four

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

persons may sit at the walls, it is valid; but if not, it is;
invalid. <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) And this teaching is
according to Rabbi, who said that a booth which is not four ells square
is not considered a booth at all.

R. Levi in the name of R. Meir said: Of two booths of potters which are
one within the other, the innermost is not valid-for a legal booth, and
is liable to have a Mezuzah, but the outermost may be used as a legal
booth, and needs not a Mezuzah. Why so? Let the outer one be considered
as a passage to the innermost, and a passage is not exempt from a
Mezuzah? Because of both booths the outer one is only temporary, and it
is exempt from a Mezuzah.

The rabbis taught: The booths of strangers, made only for the summer,
booths for women (to make the toilet), booths made for animals, or
booths made by Samaritans for the feast, and everything whatever called
a booth is valid as a religious tabernacle, provided that it is roofed
according to the Law. What is meant, "according to the Law"? Said R.
Hisda: If it was roofed for this end, what is meant by the saying:
"Anything whatever that is called a booth is valid"? To include the
booths of shepherds, of those who watch dried figs, watchmen outside of
the towns, and of those who watch fruit (all these are booths if they
are roofed according to the Law, and are valid for religious purposes).

MISHNA: An old Succah, Beth Shammai hold, is not valid, but Beth Hillel
hold it is valid. What is called an old. Succah? One which was
constructed thirty days before the festival; but if it has been
constructed on purpose for the festival, even though it be one year old,
it is valid.

GEMARA: What is the reason of Beth Shammai's opinion? It is written
\[Lev. xxiii. 34\]: "The feast of the booths shall be seven days unto
the Lord." From this we infer that the booths must be made for the
purpose of the feast. And what would Beth Hillel say to this passage?
They infer from it another theory in accordance with R. Shesheth, who
says in the name of R. Aqiba: Whence do we know that the wood that was
used for the booths, must not be used for another purpose all the seven
days? Because it is written: "The feast of the booths shall be seven
days unto the Lord." And we have learned in a Boraitha:

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> R. Jehudah b.
Bethyra said: In the same manner that the name of the Lord rests on the
feast-offering (and this prohibits the eating of the feast-offering till
the pieces are offered on the altar), so does the name of the Lord rest
on the booth, to prohibit the use of the material of which it is
constructed during the seven days. But did not Beth Shammai also infer
this prohibition from the same passage? Yea, we must therefore say that
the reason of Beth Shammai is another passage \[Deut. xvi. 13\]: "A
feast of tabernacle . . . seven days." Infer from this that the booth
must be made for this purpose. And what do Beth Hillel infer from the
above passage? They infer from it that a Succah may be made during the
intermediate days also, while Beth Shammai do not allow it.

MISHNA: If one constructs his Succah under a tree, it is the same as if
he made it in his house (under the roof). Should he construct one Succah
above another, the upper one is valid, but the lower one is not. R.
Jehudah says: Should the upper one not be inhabited, the lower one is
valid.

GEMARA: Rabha said: The Mishna refers only to a tree under which there
is more shadow than sunshine; but if the sunshine is more than the
shadow, it is valid. And I infer this, because the Mishna teaches that a
booth which was made under a tree is as if made in a house, why does it
express it thus? Let it say, it is invalid? We must therefore assume
that it means: As in a roofed house there is more shadow than sunshine,
so is it also under a tree, under which the same is the case. But if
there is more sunshine than shadow, what is the use, since the branches
of the tree, which are invalid, will combine with the roofing of the:
booth to shut out the sunshine, and thus make the Succah invalid? Said
R. Papa: The case is when one has cut off the branches. If they have
been cut off, is it not self-evident that the booth is valid? One might
say, we shall take a precautionary measure (lest any make it under a
tree which has its branches) and he comes to teach us that such
precautionary measures are not to be taken.

"*One Succah. above another*," etc. The rabbis taught: It is written
\[Lev. xxiii. 22\]: "Ye shall sit in booths." We may infer, in booths,
but not in a booth which is under a booth, or under a tree, or in a
house. On the contrary, it is written in the "booths" in the plural
(that can mean, in this and in that)? Said R. Na'hman bar Itz'hak: It
reads plural, but it is written in the singular.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

What distance must be between the upper and the lower Succah, that the
second should be invalid? Said R. Huna: One span, as we find this
measure in the law of defilement (Ahaloth, Chap. III. 7): R. Hisda and
Rabba bar R. Huna both said: Four spans. The reason is, that we do not
find any distance considered to be of any significance if it is less
than four spans. Samuel, however, said:-Ten; and his reason is, that as
to make it valid it must be no less than ten spans, so as make it
invalid there must be ten spans. When R. Dimi came from Palestine, he
said that in the west they so interpret: If the roof of the lower one
could not bear the pillows and feather-beds of the upper one, then the
lower is valid. From this we may infer that the first Tana holds that,
although the lower one cannot bear the pillows in the upper one, it is
nevertheless invalid? We may say that the difference between the first
Tana and the sages is in a case in which the roof of the lower one could
bear it, but not easily (according to him it is invalid, according to
them it is valid).

MISHNA: If a cloth be spread over the (roof of the Succah as a screen)
against the sun, or below (the roof, inside) to catch the falling
leaves, or if one spread a cloth over a (four-post) bed-tester, the
Succah is not valid, but one may spread a cloth over two bed-posts.

GEMARA: Said R. Hisda: The case is if one spread a cloth to catch
leaves; but if he did it only for ornament, it is allowed. Is not this
self-evident? Did not the Mishna say plainly "to catch leaves"? One
might say the same is the case when it is an ornament also, but the
Mishna mentioned a thing, it is usually so done; he comes to teach it is
not so. It was taught: That such ornaments do not make it lower (if it
was more than twenty ells high, it is not lowered thereby, or if it was
ten spans they do not make it invalid). Said R. Ashi: But if the cloth
was hung before a side-wall, it makes it smaller. It happened once that
the shirt of Menymin, the servant of R. Ashi, was soaked in water, and
he spread it on the roof of the booth to dry. Said R. Ashi to him: Take
it off, for one might say, we cover the roof with a thing which is
subject to defilement. But everybody will see that it is wet? I mean to
say, that when it will be dry, you shall take it off.

It was taught: If the ornaments of the Succah are four spans under the
roof, R. Na'hman said the Succah is valid, but R. Hisda and Rabha bar R.
Huna both say it is invalid. But sages were once the guests of the
exilarch, and R. Na'hman made them

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

sleep in a booth where the ornaments were four spans beneath the roof;
and they kept silent, and said nothing. Then he asked them: Did the
Masters retract their decision? And they answered: We are delegates for
a religious purpose, and therefore we are free from the duty of a
Succah.

R. Jehudah in the name of Samuel said: One may sleep in a nuptial bed,
because its canopy is not considered as a roof (being slanting) even
when it is ten spans high. An objection was raised: We have learned, who
sleeps under a canopy in a booth does not fulfil his duty? There is the
case when the canopy is not of a nuptial bed, but different, like a
roof. Rabha bar R. Huna lectured: One may sleep under a canopy, although
it is like the roof, and high ten spans; and it is according to R.
Jehudah, who said that a temporary tent cannot make a permanent one be
ignored, as we have learned in a Mishna. R. Jehudah said: Our custom was
to sleep in the booth under the bed in the presence of the elders. But
let him say: The Halakha prevails according to R. Jehudah? If he would
say so, one might say it is only the case with a bed because it is made
to be slept on, but not underneath it (and therefore cannot make the
permanent tent ignored); but in the case of a bed with a canopy, which
was made for sleeping in, it may be thought different. Therefore he
teaches us there is no difference.

MISHNA: If one has trained a vine, or gourd, or ivy over the booth, and
covered it, it is not valid; but should the covering be the greater part
of the roof (and they the smaller part), or if they had been cut off, it
is valid. This is the rule: Everything subject to defilement, and not
growing from the ground, must not be used as a roof to the booth; but
everything not subject to defilement, and growing from the ground, may
be used.

GEMARA: R. Joseph was sitting in the presence of R. Huna, and said: To
the Mishna which says, if they are cut off, the Succah is valid. Said
Rabh: They (the remainder of the roof) must nevertheless be shaken
(after having been cut off). Said R. Huna to him: This said Samuel. R.
Joseph turned away his face from him and said: Did I say to you Samuel
did not say it? I told You Rabh said, and Samuel may have said it also.
Rejoined R. Huna: But I tell you that only Samuel said it, and not Rabh,
because, according to the latter, it is valid without shaking, as it
happened once that R. Amram the Pious made fringes \[Num. xv. 38\] on
the garment of his wife, but he did not cut asunder the heads of the
thread; and later, when he came to ask about

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

it, R. Hiya b. Ashi said to him: So said Rabh: The cutting asunder of
the thread, this makes the fringes lawful. From this we see that
according to Rabh the cutting off makes it valid, though nothing but
this was done. And the same is the case here also. Cutting off makes
valid. Shall we assume that the point of difference between the Tanaim
of the following Boraitha is the same as that of Rabh and Samuel?
Namely, we have learned in an addition to the Mishna: If a myrtle bough
has more berries than leaves, it is invalid till the latter are made
fewer; but it is not allowed to do so on a festival (Succah, Chap.
III.). If, however, one transgressed, and cut off the berries on a
festival, the myrtle bough is invalid according to R. Simeon b. R.
Jehozodok, but is valid according to the sages. Now, the schoolmen
thought the point on which R. Simeon and the sages differ is whether the
cutting is a final preparation, for they thought all agree that the
Lulab should be tied together n the beginning with the other branches,
drawing a lesson from the Succah, about which it is said: "Ye shall
*make*," *i.e.*, you shall commence to make, but not use what is made
already. And R. Simeon says it is invalid, because he does not regard
the cutting as a final preparation, and the Lulab, being tied with an
invalid myrtle, is invalid; but the sages hold the cutting is a final
preparation, and therefore the Lulab is valid. Hence the point whereon
they differ is the same as that whereon Rabh and Samuel differ: whether
the cutting off is a final preparation (and then shaking is not needed)
or not. Nay, all agree that the cutting off is *not* considered a final
preparation, but R. Simeon and the sages differ whether the Lulab has to
be tied together at all, or not; R. Simeon maintains that it must, and
the sages say, it must not; as we find in a Boraitha that the sages make
no difference whether it was tied or not, and only R. Jehudah maintained
that if untied it is invalid. But according to whom would be the
following teaching: There is a merit in tying the Lulab; it is, however,
valid if it is untied? This is in accordance with the rabbis, and the
merit is because it is nicer when tied, as it is explained elsewhere
that the word \[Ex. xv. 2\] ‏ואנוהו‎ means, "beautify your religious
performances for the Lord's sake."

"*This is the rule: everything subject to defilement*," etc. Whence is
all this deduced? Said Resh Lakish: It is written \[Gen. ii. 6\]: "But
there went up a mist from the earth." As a mist is not subject to
defilement, and ascends from the earth, so also must the Succah be a
thing not subject to defilement,

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

and growing from the earth. This would be right according to those who
said that the booths in the desert were of clouds of glory; but
according to those who say that they were ordinary booths, what can be
said? Namely, as we learn in the following Boraitha: It is written
\[Lev. xxxiii. 43\]: "I caused the children of Israel to dwell in
booths": these were clouds of glory, R. Eliezer said. But R. Aqiba said:
They were ordinary booths. Said R. Ashi: It is written \[Deut. xxi.
13\]: "Of thy threshing-floor and wine-press." *Of* thy threshing-floor,
but not the threshing-floor itself; *from* thy wine-press, but not the
wine-press itself. R. Hisda said: From the following passage \[Nehem.
viii. 15\]: "Go forth unto the mountain and fetch olive leaves, and
oleaster leaves, and myrtle leaves, and palm leaves, and leaves of the
three-leaved myrtle, to make booths, as it is written." Are not the
leaves of the myrtle and those of the three-leaved myrtle the same? Said
R. Hisda: The myrtle leaves for the Succah, and the three-leaved myrtle
for a Lulab.

MISHNA: Bundles of straw, of wood, and of twigs must not be used to
cover the Succah; all of these are become valid, however, if the bundles
are loosed. As side-walls, however, all of these may be used.

GEMARA: R. Jacob said: I have heard from R. Johanan two things which he
explained to me, namely: the above Mishna, and the Mishna farther on,
"Should one hollow out a space in a stack (of sheaves) to use it as a
Succah, it is not considered such." Of one of them he says the reason is
that it is only a precautionary measure, lest one make his storehouse
for a Succah, which biblically is allowed; and of the other he said the
reason is, because it is written: "Ye shall make," from which we infer,
it must not be ready-made (and this is biblical). But I don't know for
which Mishna the reasons are respectively given. Said R. Jeremiah: Let
us see. R. Hiya bar Abba said in the name of R. Johanan: Why is it
prohibited to cover with bundles of straw, wood, or twigs? Because it
may happen a man comes from the field in the evening with his bundle on
the shoulder and puts it on the roof for the purpose of drying, and
later he resolves to leave it there as a roof to the booth, and it is
said, "Ye shall make it," but not have ready-made. Now, as we see that
the reason for this is biblical, that for our Mishna must be a
precautionary measure, Then why was R. Jacob doubtful? Because he had
not heard the saying of R. Hiya in R. Johanan's name. Said R. Ashi: What
is the difference? Does,

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

then, the law, "shall make," apply only to our Mishna, and not to the
other Mishna farther on, or does the precautionary measure apply only to
the other Mishna, and not to ours? Both are alike (and why, then, does
he make a difference between them?). R. Johanan can say that his
teaching is correct, because our Mishna states, they must not cover it;
that means, to commence it, and it is a precautionary measure, but if he
has covered, it is valid. But there it is said, It is not a Succah, even
after it has been covered; it is even biblically not a Succah.

Said Rabha bar bar Hana: I have heard in the name of R. Johanan three
things: If he has roofed it with bundles of flax it is invalid, but if
with unsoaked flax, it is valid; and as for *Hushne* \[meaning
uncertain\] flax, I am in doubt about it. Rabha bar bar Hana added to
this: What he meant by Hushne flax, I don't understand. Does he mean,
flax soaked and dried, but not brushed; or brushed already, but not made
into bundles?

R. Hanan bar Abba said: With thorns and weeds a Succah may be covered.
Abayi, however, said, if they have no leaves, one may; but if they have
leaves, one must not. Why so? Because, when the leaves fall down, this
will trouble him, and he will leave the booth and go out. R. Gidl said
in the name of Rabh: The roots of a tree may be used to cover with,
although they are intertwined, because a bundle made by nature is not
called a bundle. And even if he tied together the extremities, he may
nevertheless use them, because as at the base they intertwine naturally,
the bundle at the top is not considered such.

R. Hisda in the name of Rabbina b. Shila said: Branches (stalks) of
διχρα may be used for covering, though they are intertwined, because a
bundle made by nature is not considered as a bundle. And although one
ties them together himself, he may nevertheless use them, because as at
the base they intertwine naturally, the bundle at the top is not
considered such. So also we have learned in a Boraitha: The stalks of
διχρα may be used as covering.

Maremar lectured: The bundles they sell out in the market in Syria may
be used to cover, although they are tied together, because they tied
them only to know the number. Huts of reeds, used by fowlers, if they
are untied at the top, may be used as a covering for a booth although
they are yet tied together below? Said R. Papa: One loosens them at the
bottom also. R. Huna the son of R. Joshuah, however, said: Even if they

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

were not untied at the base, they also may be used, because a bundle
that cannot hold together is not called a bundle.

R. Abba said in the name of Samuel: If of herbs by which the sages said
a man can fulfil his duty to eat bitter herbs on Passover was made a
tent, they bring defilement, when a corpse or part of a corpse was in
it, to all vessels that are in the tent; but if a partition was made of
them they do not prevent the defilement to spread further, and if they
are used to cover a Succah, they make it invalid, because when they
become dry they crumble and fall. Therefore, even if they are wet, they
are considered not to exist at all, and in place of a roof an empty
piece of space.

MISHNA: One may cover with thin boards, according to R. Jehudah, but R.
Meir prohibits it. If one has put a deal board four spans wide over the
booth, it is valid, provided that one sleep not under it (the board).

GEMARA: Said Rabh: They differ only about boards that are four spans
wide. R. Meir prohibits it as a precautionary measure, lest he come to
make a ceiling, and R. Jehudah does not take this measure; but if they
were less than four spans, all agree that it may be used. Samuel,
however, says, on the contrary: They differ only if it is less than four
spans; but if more, all agree it is prohibited. If it is less than four
spans and even less than three (they differ), how can it be? Is it not
considered a stick? Said R. Papa: Samuel meant to say thus: If it is
four spans, all agree it is not valid; less than three, all agree it is
valid. They differ only from three to four; one holds because it is not
of the prescribed size (four spans), it is valid, because they are
considered as sticks; and another holds, as it is more than three, to
which the theory of Lavud cannot apply, we take the precautionary
measure. Come and hear: Two sheets, if put in the middle of the roof,
each of which is less than four, but whose combined width is four spans
or more, make the booth invalid; but two boards of the same sizes do not
combine to make it invalid. R. Meir, however, said: The same is the case
with both. It would be right according to Samuel, who said that they
differ when it is less than four spans; but if it is four spans, all
agree it is invalid, because then it would be explained that the
combined width makes the Succah invalid if it is on the side of the roof
(attached to a wall), and their combined width is four ells, not four
spans (for otherwise, if the roof is by the wall, it is valid up to four
ells because it is considered as a crooked wall continued). But

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

according to Rabh's opinion, this can be only according to R. Meir;. but
according to R. Jehudah, what can be meant by the expression "combined
width," since according to him, if they are less than four spans, they
are considered sticks? R. Jehudah does not mean combined width, but only
uses the same expression as R. Meir (without a particular meaning).

We have learned in a Boraitha according to Rabh, and in another Boraitha
according to Samuel: according to Rabh, if one has covered the Succah
with boards of cedar that are less than four spans wide, all agree they
are valid; but if they are four spans, R. Meir makes it invalid, and R.
Jehudah makes it valid. Said R. Jehudah: It happened once, in a time of
danger, we brought boards four spans wide, and roofed a balcony and used
it as a Succah, and the sages answered him: A dangerous time does not
prove. According to Samuel: If one has roofed the booth with cedar
boards four spans wide, all agree it is invalid; if less, according to
R. Meir, it is invalid; according to R. Jehudah, valid. R. Meir agrees,
however, that if there was between one board and the other the width of
a board, one may lay between anything fit, and the Succah is valid. And
R. Jehudah agrees, that if one board was wide four spans, it is valid,
but one must not sleep under it, and who does so does not fulfil the
duty of a Succah.

It was taught: If one placed the boards on their edges on the Succah, R.
Huna said the booth is invalid, but R. Hisda and Rabba bar R. Huna both
said it is valid. It happened once R. Na'hman came to Sura: R. Hisda and
Rabba bar R. Huna visited him and asked him the law about the boards in
question, and he said: They are considered as iron spits, and certainly
invalid. Said R. Huna to them: Did I not tell you that R. Na'hman agrees
with me? And they answered him: Did the Master explain to us the reason
of this, and we did not accept it? Rejoined R. Huna: Did you ask me for
the reason, and I did not tell it to you?

MISHNA: If small rafters, over which is no ceiling, are to be used for a
booth, R. Jehudah says: Beth Shammai hold, the rafters must be loosened,
and the middle one out of every three removed. But Beth Hillel hold: One
must either loosen them, or else remove one of every three. R. Meir
says: One must remove one out of three, but one need not loosen.

GEMARA: It is right according to Beth Hillel, as their reason is because
it is written: "Ye shall *make*," and not have

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

ready-made. Hence either of the two is sufficient. But what is the
reason of Beth Shammai? If the reason is the same, why must he do both?
Is not one sufficient? It is as a precautionary measure, and Beth
Shammai meant to say thus: Although one has loosened, it is not valid
until he removes one of every three. If it is so, then Beth Shammai said
the same as R. Meir. R. Meir meant to say, Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel
did not differ, if one has removed same, though they were not loosened.

MISHNA: If one roofs his booth with iron spits, or with boards of a
bedstead, if there is as wide a space between them (covered with
anything fit) as one of them, it is valid. If one should hollow out a
space in a stack (of sheaves) to use it as a Succah (although of the
prescribed size), it is not considered as a Succah at all.

GEMARA: Shall we assume that the decision of R. Huna the son of R.
Joshuah, who says, that if the open spaces of a fence equal the fence
proper it is not valid (Erubin, p. 35), contradicts this Mishna? R. Huna
can explain the Mishna, that it means an interspace a trifle wider than
the spit or board itself, so as to allow it to be taken out and replaced
without difficulty. But can it not be made precisely to fit? (Rashi
explains this question thus: At the first glance the answer of R. Huna
is that, whenever the thing is mentioned to be of the same width, it is
meant to be a trifle less wide, so as to be removed without difficulty:
and to this comes the question, why should it be so made? can it not be
made to fit precisely? And to this question the answer of R. Ammi will
be farther on. But Tospheth oppose to this another explanation, which is
still more complicated, and we have therefore translated the text
literally.) Said R. Ammi: Yea, but this Mishna means, it is only valid
then, when it is a trifle more. Rabba, however, said: The Mishna can be
explained even if it was precisely; but if it was laid lengthwise, it
should be placed crosswise, and *vice versa* (and above them the lawful
roofing, so that the fit must be more than the unfit roofing, and thus
the fit portion above neutralizes the unfit portion below).

"*With boards of a bedstead*." Shall we assume that this is a support to
R. Ammi bar Tibiumi, who said that if one covered the Succah with broken
utensils it is invalid? Nay, the Mishna can be explained as R. Hanan
said in the name of Rabbi. If the side-board of the bedstead was laid
with two short boards, or two short boards with the side-board, which is
subject to defilement (as will be explained, Kelim, Chap. XIX. 9). What
is meant

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

by broken utensils? Said Abayi: Remnants of silken togas, that measure
less than three fingers square, and are of no value to either rich or
poor (Sabbath, p. 272). We have learned in a Boraitha in accordance with
R. Ammi bar Tibiumi: The remainders of a mat of bark or reeds, although
they are less than of the prescribed size to be subject to defilement,
must not be used to cover a Succah. A mat of sticks, if it is large, may
be used to cover it (because a large one is only made for a covering,
and is not a utensil subject to defilement); but if small, it may not.
R. Eliezer, however, said, that even a large one is subject to
defilement, and may not be used.

"*If one should hollow*," etc. R. Huna said: The case is, when there is
no hole of the size of one span in length by seven in width; but if
there was, it is a Succah. <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) We have
learned so also in a Boraitha: If one hollows out a space in a stack to
use it as a Succah, it is a Succah. And this Boraitha must be explained
as the decree of R. Huna to prevent the contradiction to our Mishna.

MISHNA: If one suspends textile walls from the roof downwards, if they
do not reach the ground within three spans, it is invalid. If they stand
on the ground and are high ten spans, it is valid. R. Jose, however,
said: Even when the walls do not reach the ground by more than three
spans the law of ten spans applies to both cases (and in either case it
is valid).

GEMARA: On what point do they differ? One holds that a hanging partition
makes the Succah valid, and the other that it does not. We have learned
in the Mishna in Erubin, Chap. VIII. p. 206, concerning a wall that was
between two courts and a partition was made, and R. Jehudah said there:
The partition is not more effectual than the wall which is between them.
Said Rabba bar bar Hana, in the name of R. Johanan: R. Jehudah's decree
there is of the same system as R. Jose's in our Mishna, who says that a
hanging partition makes valid. In reality, however, it is not so. R.
Jehudah does not agree with R. Jose, and *vice versa*. Because R.
Jehudah, who allows it there, does so because Erubin of the courts are
rabbinical; but here, in the case of the Succah, which is biblical, he
would not allow it. And, on the contrary, R. Jose,

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

who allows it here, does it because the Succah is only a positive
commandment; but concerning Sabbath, where there is a capital
punishment, he would not allow it. And if it be asked, What happened in
Ziporeth (which will be related farther on), according to whose opinion
was it? Not according to R. Jose, nor in accordance with R. Jehudah, but
according to R. Ishmael bar Jose. Namely: When R. Dimi came from
Palestine, he told that it happened once (in Ziporeth) that they had
forgotten to bring the holy scrolls on the eve of Sabbath, and on the
morrow they put sheets on the pillars and brought the holy scrolls, and
read them (and these hanging partitions were made at the command of R.
Ishmael).

R. Hisda in the name of Abimi said: A mat which is large four spans and
a trifle can be used as a side-wall to the Succah. How shall it be
placed? It shall be hung in the middle, less than three spans from the
ground, and less than three spans from the roof, because we apply the
law of Lavud to both places. Is not this self-evident? One may say that
two Lavuds in one case do not apply, he comes to teach us that we may.

MISHNA: If the roof is three spans distant from the walls, the Succah is
invalid. If the roof of a house was broken, and it was covered, then if
there are four ells between the wall and the covering, it is invalid;
but if less it is valid. The same is the case with a court surrounded by
balconies. If the top of a large Succah was covered with something
unfit, if it is distant four ells it is not valid.

GEMARA: Rabha said: I once found the rabbis of the college sitting and
declaring: Air makes the Succah invalid with three spans, but unfit
covering makes it invalid only with no less than four ells; and I said
to them: Where do you find that air makes invalid with three spans? In
our Mishna, which teaches if the roof was at a distance of three spans
it is invalid? Then, learn also from it that unfit covering should not
make the Succah invalid if it is less than four *ells*? as it teaches
farther on, that a house whose roof was broken, and it was covered in
the middle, if there is from the covering to the wall four ells, then it
is invalid? And they answered: Leave alone this teaching, because Rabh
and Samuel both said that this teaching is only because we consider it
as a crooked wall. And I rejoined: If it is so, what would be according
to your opinion? If there would be air less than three spans, and unfit
covering less than four ells., in the same place, it certainly would be
valid; but if one covered the

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

vacant space with iron spits, it would make it invalid. Now, the air,
which is so rigorous that it makes invalid by three spans, will not be
equal to an invalid covering which is so lenient that it makes invalid
only by four ells? And they said to me: And according to your theory,
that unfit covering makes invalid only when it is four ells, how would
the case be if empty air less than three spans were added to it? Would
it not be valid? But if one puts iron spits over the empty place, would
it not make it invalid? Now, then, does not the same question apply to
your theory also? And I rejoined again: What comparison is this? In my
opinion, unfit covering makes invalid with four ells, because that is
the prescribed quantity, and the same is with air; and as both
quantities are not equal, they do not combine together to make the
Succah invalid. But according to your opinion, that the reason is not
because it is a prescribed quantity, but because the roof is separated
from the wall, then the question is, what is the difference whether it
be separated from the wall by air less than three spans and unfit
covering, or by iron spits and unfit covering? Said Abayi to him: And
even according to the Master's opinion, that because the quantities are
not equal they do not combine, this can be said only of a large Succah,
where unfit covering makes not invalid unless it is four ells; but in a
small Succah, where unfit covering makes it invalid with three spans,
are not the quantities then equal? Consequently they must combine, even
in a large Succah. Answered Rabha: In a small Succah it is not because
the prescribed quantities are equal, but because the prescribed size for
a Succah does not remain.

Abayi said: If there was air three spans wide in a large Succah, and one
diminished it by sticks or iron spits, it is considered as diminished;
but if it was a small Succah, if with sticks it is lawful, but with iron
spits it is not. But this is the case only when it is near the wall. If
in the middle of the roof, however, R. A'ha and Rabina differed:
According to one, the law of Lavud applies also in the middle, and
according to the other it can only be applied when they are at the side.

R. Jehudah bar Ilai lectured: If the roof of a house was broken, and one
covered it with fit covering, it is valid for a Succah. Said R. Ishmael
bar Jose to him: Rabbi, explain your decision, because my father had
explained thus: If it is less than four ells from the wall, then it is
valid; but if four or more, it is invalid. Again lectured the same: An
*abruma* (a small fish not distinguishable from prohibited reptiles) is
permitted. Said R. Ishmael

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

to him: Rabbi, explain the decision, for so said my father: From one
place it is permitted, from another it is not. Accordingly, Abayi said:
The small fish called Tza'hntha (smelt), of the river Bab, are permitted
(and from another not).

It was taught: If one has covered a balcony which has small pillars
(less than three spans one from the other), it is valid for a Succah:
but if it has no pillars, Abayi said it is valid, because the edge of
the roof downward may be considered as making (forming) a wall; but
Rabha said it is invalid, because he does not hold this theory. Said
Rabha to Abayi: According to thee, who holdest this theory, even if the
middle wall of the Succah was broken, let it also be valid, as the edge
of the roof is considered to descend and make a wall. Said Abayi: I
yield to thee in this point, because it looks like an open entry. An
objection was raised from our Mishna: If a court is surrounded by
balconies, etc., why? Let it also be considered that the edge of the
roof makes it a wall? Rabha explained, in accordance with Abayi's
opinion, that the case is that the edge projected not over the wall, but
was even with it.

R. Ashi found R. Kahna, who had roofed a balcony that had no small
pillars, and he asked him: Does not the Master hold what Rabha said,
that when there are no pillars the Succah is invalid? And he took him
outside and showed him that there were pillars not visible inside, but
only outside; and it was taught in Erubin (p. 17), if it was seen from
outside, and not from inside, it is regarded as a side-beam, and a
side-beam is the same as a small pillar.

A Boraitha taught: A vestibule, outside of the booth, is considered as
the booth itself. What is meant by this? Said Ullah: A vestibule formed
by sticks projecting beyond the Succah. Are not three walls needed? When
there are. But is it not needed that there be more shadow than sunshine?
If there was. But is not a prescribed size needed? If it was. If so,
what comes he to teach us? Lest one say, that because the Succah was
made for sitting inside, shall the outside not be considered a Succah at
all, he comes to teach us it is not.

MISHNA: If one makes a Succah in the form of a cone, or leans the roof
against a wall, R. Eliezer says it is not valid, because it has no roof;
but the sages declare it is valid.

GEMARA: A Boraitha taught: R. Eliezer admits, if one placed it one span
over the ground, or separated it one span from the wall, the Succah is
valid. What is the reason of the sages?

for the theory of Lavud applies to them, and they are regarded as
upright. They hold that the slanting parts of a tent are considered as
the tent itself. Abayi found R. Joseph sleeping in a nuptial bed in a
Succah. Said Abayi to him: According to whom do you do so? According to
R. Eliezer? Then you left the majority of rabbis, and followed an
individual. Answered he: The Boraitha teaches the contrary: That R.
Eliezer makes it valid, but the sages say it is invalid. Rejoined Abayi:
Then you leave a Mishna, and act according to a Boraitha. And he
answered: The Mishna is written according to an individual's opinion, as
we have learned in a Boraitha: if one makes a booth in the form of a
cave, or leans the roof on a wall, R. Nathan said that R. Eliezer makes
it invalid, because it has no roof, but the sages permit this.

MISHNA: A large reed mat made for sleeping on is subject to defilement,
and a Succah must not be covered with it; but if it was made to cover a
booth, it may be used, and is not subject to defilement. R. Eleazar
said: There is no difference whether it is large or small, but only the
use for which it was made is considered; if for sleeping, then it is
subject to defilement, and must not be used; but in the other case, if
for covering, it is not subject to defilement, and may be used.

GEMARA: Did not the Mishna contradict itself? In the first part it says,
if it was made for sleeping, then it is subject to defilement, etc., but
if the purpose for which it was made was not expressed, it must be
considered as for a covering. And the second part says, "If it was
*made* for a cover"; from this we may infer, if the purpose was not
expressed we consider it for sleeping? Said R. Papa: In case of a small
one, if the purpose was not expressed, all agree it may be considered as
for sleeping; but in case of a large one, the first Tana holds that
where no purpose was expressed it is considered to have been made for
covering. But R. Eliezer holds, that even a large one is also usually
made for sleeping, and the expression in the Mishna, "if it was made for
sleeping," is to be explained so: if it was made, say it is for the
purpose of sleeping, unless he expressed another purpose.

The rabbis taught: A mat made of bark or papyrus, if large, may be used
for a cover; but if small, it may not. If it is of reeds, or *hilath*, a
large one may be used for covering; but if they are woven together, it
may not. R. Ishmael bar Jose said in the name of his father: Both may be
used to cover, and the same said R. Dosa.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

We have learned (Edioth, III. 4): "All hutzlahs <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) are liable to become unclean from a corpse,
so is the decree of R. Dosa; but the sages said: They are liable to
become unclean only by pressing." What are *hutzlahs*? Said R. Simeon
bar Lakish: It means ordinary mats, and the same is according to his
theory elsewhere, where he said: I would sacrifice myself to bring back
to life R. Hiya and his children, because in the ancient time, when the
Torah was forgotten by Israel, Ezra came from Babylon, and reëstablished
it again; when afterwards it was again forgotten, Hillel the Babylonian
came up from Babylon and restored it again; and when it was again
forgotten, came R. Hiya and his children and restored it again. And they
said to this: That R. Dosa and the sages did not differ about the mats
of the city of Usha, that they are subject to defilement, and that the
mats of Tiberia are not; what they do differ about is the mats of other
places: one holds that because nobody sits on them, they are equal to
those of Tiberia; and the others hold that because it can happen that
somebody should sit upon them, they are equal to the mats of Usha.

We learned in a Boraitha: R. Hananiah said: When I came into the exile,
I found an old man who said to me that to cover a Succah with a mat is
lawful; afterwards, when I came to R. Joshuah my father's brother, he
admitted this theory. Said R. Hisda: This is only when it is not seamed.
Said Ullah: The mats from the city of Mehuzah, but for their scams,
would be lawful to be used for covering. So also we have learned in a
Boraitha: Mats may be used for covering, provided they have no seams.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[10:1](suc03.htm#fr_6.md) The Gemara interprets this
law by a geometric calculation how much space a person needs, and the
relation of a circle and a square, with illustrations, which do not
belong here, and therefore we omit.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[20:1](suc03.htm#fr_7.md) The reason is because a
hole of a span constitutes a legal tent in the law of defilement, and
the covering above it is called roofing. Now, if one enlarged this hole
to the size prescribed for a Succah, from the base upwards, so that he
diminished the covering, he is considered to have made a new roofing and
thus a new tent for this purpose, and it is a valid Succah. (Rashi.)
