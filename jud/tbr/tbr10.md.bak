# BERAKOTH (BENEDICTIONS)

### I. ON RECITING THE SHMA‘.

#### The Time of Reciting the Shma‘ in the Evening.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>I. 1. AT what time does one begin to
recite <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md). the Shma‘ <span
id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md) in the evening? <span
id="fr_7"></span>[3](#fn_7.md) At the hour that the priests enter (the
Temple precincts) to eat their portion <span id="fr_8"></span>[4](#fn_8.md)
\[and they may say it\] until the end of the first watch. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[5](#fn_9.md) Such is the opinion of R. Eliezer. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[6](#fn_10.md) But the Majority <span
id="fr_11"></span>[7](#fn_11.md) say: until midnight.

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>Rabban Gamaliel <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) says: until the first sign of gray of dawn
ascends. <span id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md)

2\. An incident \[is told of him\], that his sons came from a
banquet. <span id="fr_14"></span>[3](#fn_14.md) They said to him: We have
not recited the Shma‘. He said to them, If the first sign of gray of
dawn has not ascended you are under obligation to recite.

3\. And this does not apply \[to the Shma‘\] alone, but to everything
which the Majority limit to midnight—the religious duties extend to the
time that the first sign of gray of dawn ascends. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[4](#fn_15.md)

\[So\] the duty of burning the fat pieces and the limbs of the
sacrifices, and the eating of the paschal lambs, <span
id="fr_16"></span>[5](#fn_16.md) lasts until the first sign of gray of dawn
ascends, and so the duty of consuming all the things that are to be
eaten on one day lasts until the first sign of gray of dawn ascends. If
so, why did the Majority say \[of the Shma‘\], until midnight? Solely to
keep men far from transgression.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

**T**. I. 1. At what time does one begin to recite the Shma‘ in the
evening? At the hour that men go indoors to eat their meal on
Sabbath-eve. Such is the opinion of R. Meir. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) But the Majority say: At the hour that the
priests are fit to eat of their portion. The sign for this is the coming
out of the stars. And though there is no proof for this (in Scripture)
yet there is a technical reminder of it in "*and half of them held the
spears from the rising of the morning till the stars came out*." <span
id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md)

R. Simeon <span id="fr_19"></span>[3](#fn_19.md) says: Sometimes a man
recites it twice in the night, once before the first gray of dawn has
ascended, and once after this. Thus he fulfils his obligation both for
the day and for the night.

Rabbi <span id="fr_20"></span>[4](#fn_20.md) says: There are four
watches <span id="fr_21"></span>[5](#fn_21.md) in the night. An *‘Onah* is
the twenty-fourth part of an hour, and an *‘Eth* the twenty-fourth part
of an ‘Onah, and *Rega‘* the twenty-fourth part of an ‘Eth.

R. Nathan <span id="fr_22"></span>[6](#fn_22.md) says: There are three
watches in the night, for it is said: "*in the beginning of the middle
watch*," <span id="fr_23"></span>[7](#fn_23.md) and every "middle" has one
after it and one before.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_5"></span>[1:1](tbr10.htm#fr_5.md) *recite*, not "say," for
the Shma‘ is recited in half-chanting fashion.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[1:2](tbr10.htm#fr_6.md) *Shma‘*, *i.e.* Deut.
64<sup>4-9</sup>; 11<sup>13-21</sup>; Num. 15<sup>37-41</sup>. See SA,
pp. 40-42, Oesterley and Box, pp. 364-368. "The Unity of God is the
basis of the Jewish Creed, the Love of God the basis of the Jewish Life.
This Love towards God was to be exerted with heart, and soul, and might.
. . The Shma‘ thus enshrines the fundamental *dogma* (Monotheism), the
fundamental *duty* (Love), the fundamental *discipline* (Study of the
Law), and the fundamental *method* (union of 'Letter' and 'Spirit') of
the Jewish religion" (Abrahams in SA, pp. lii. *sq*).

<span id="fn_7"></span>[1:3](tbr10.htm#fr_7.md) *evening*. Mentioned first,
for the Jewish day begins then. The morning Shma‘ is discussed in *M*.
2.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[1:4](tbr10.htm#fr_8.md) *portion*. Priests who were
unclean were not allowed to eat consecrated food till sunset (Lev.
22<sup>7</sup>), "the coming out of the stars," see *T*.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[1:5](tbr10.htm#fr_9.md) *the first watch*. See *T*.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[1:6](tbr10.htm#fr_10.md) *R. Eliezer*, *i.e.* R.
E. ben Hyrkanos, flourished c. 90-130 A.D. His wife, Imma Shalom, was
the sister of R. Gamaliel II.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[1:7](tbr10.htm#fr_11.md) *the Majority*. Lit. wise
men, Scholars. But the term is used of the mass of scholars of repute
and standing in contrast to a few or one.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[2:1](tbr10.htm#fr_12.md) *Rabban Gamaliel*. R.
Gamaliel II., grandson of Gamaliel I. He held the chief authority from
about 90-110 A.D. The *Halaka*, *i.e.* the Rule, here follows his
opinion. The title *Rabban* is confined to certain members of the
patriarchal house, Gamaliel I. and II., Simeon, son of Gamaliel II., and
Gamaliel III., also Jochanan ben Zakkai is so called (Strack, p. 85).

<span id="fn_13"></span>[2:2](tbr10.htm#fr_13.md) *the first sign of gray
of dawn ascends*. There are three phrases which refer to the dawn:

(*a*) "the pillar of the dawn ascended" (*‘alah ‘ammud ha shachar*),
here paraphrased as the first sign of gray in the sky.

(*b*) "the shining out of the Sun" (*hanetz chammah*), *M*. I. 4 (2).

(*c*) the sun itself is seen (*T*. I. 2 end).

<span id="fn_14"></span>[2:3](tbr10.htm#fr_14.md) *From a banquet*. *i.e.*
after midnight.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[2:4](tbr10.htm#fr_15.md) The reason is given in
the end of this mishna.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[2:5](tbr10.htm#fr_16.md) *And the eating of the
paschal lambs*, omitted in B.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[3:1](tbr10.htm#fr_17.md) *R. Meir*. See [p.
25](tbr25.htm#page_25.md).

<span id="fn_18"></span>[3:2](tbr10.htm#fr_18) Neh. 4<sup>21</sup> (15.md).

<span id="fn_19"></span>[3:3](tbr10.htm#fr_19.md) R. Simeon ben Eleazar, c.
160-200.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[3:4](tbr10.htm#fr_20.md) *Rabbi*. R. Judah the
Prince, the Son of R. Simeon ben Gamaliel II., born on the day of R.
Aqiba's death—for "the sun rises, the sun sets"—*i.e.* 135 A.D., at Usha
in Galilee. He lived and taught there and in the neighbourhood. He is
the accepted compiler of our present Mishna (see Introduction, [p.
ix](tbr03.htm#page_ix).md). The date of his death is not known, some
critics placing it as early as 193 A.D., others nearly as late as 220
A.D.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[3:5](tbr10.htm#fr_21.md) *four watches*. He
accepted the Roman system, and apparently the division of the day into
twenty-four hours.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[3:6](tbr10.htm#fr_22.md) *R. Nathan*. Contemporary
with R. Judah. He came from Babylon to Palestine, and is the reputed
author of the *Aboth de R. Nathan*, which Strack calls a "Tosephta to
the Pirqe Aboth" (p. 69).

<span id="fn_23"></span>[3:7](tbr10.htm#fr_23.md) Judg. 7<sup>19</sup>.
