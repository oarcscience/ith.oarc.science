### On Mistakes (*continued*). R. Chanina's Knowledge of the Effect of His Prayers.

5\. He who is praying and makes a mistake—it is a bad omen for him. And
if he is the representative of the congregation <span
id="fr_266"></span>[4](#fn_265) it is a bad omen for those that bid him
represent them, because a man's representative is like himself. <span
id="fr_267"></span>[5](#fn_266) They tell of R. Chanina b. Dosa that he
used to pray over the sick and say: This one will live, and this one
will die. They said to him: Whence knowest thou \[this\]? He said to
them: If my prayer is fluent <span id="fr_268"></span>[6](#fn_267) in my
mouth I know that he \[the sick

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>man\] is accepted, and if not I know
that he is rejected.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_262"></span>[41:1](tbr35.htm#fr_263) B prefixes: "He that
says, Let the good say the Benediction, lo, this smacks of heresy
(*minûth*)," as suggesting the division of members into worthy and
unworthy. But it would not appear to have any connexion with
Christianity.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[41:2](tbr35.htm#fr_264) *after the priests*.
The blessing from Num. 6<sup>24-26</sup> was given by the priests
between the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Benedictions (SA, p. 53). If the
leader said "Amen" he was in danger of forgetting the last Benediction.
The priests face the people, and the leader faces the priests and says
the blessings word for word for them to repeat. To each of the three
blessings the people say Amen. See Maimonides.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[41:3](tbr35.htm#fr_265) *his hands*. Literally
"his palms," perhaps the palms of the hands were held up towards the
congregation.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[41:4](tbr36.htm#fr_266) *the representative of
the congregation* (*shliach tsibbur*). In his duties for the occasion;
it was not a permanent office (Elbogen, p. 488).

<span id="fn_266"></span>[41:5](tbr36.htm#fr_267) *like himself*. Cf.
Matt. 10<sup>40</sup>. See my *Manual of Christian Evidences for Jewish
People*, §§ 339 *sq*.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[41:6](tbr36.htm#fr_268) *fluent*. Cf. *M*. IV.
3 (p. 31).
