#### The Going forth from Egypt.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span> I. 8 (5). We make mention at night
of the going forth from Egypt. <span id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md) R.
Lazar <span id="fr_65"></span>[2](#fn_65.md) ben Azariah said: Lo, I was
about seventy years old, and I had not the merit of \[understanding
why\] the Going forth from Egypt should be said at night until Ben
Zoma <span id="fr_66"></span>[3](#fn_66.md) expounded it, to the effect,
that it is: "That thou mayest remember the day of thy going forth from
the land of Egypt all the days of thy life" <span
id="fr_67"></span>[4](#fn_67.md)—"the days of thy life" are the days,
"all <span id="fr_68"></span>[5](#fn_68.md) the days of thy life" are the
nights. But the Majority say: "The days of thy life" (are thy days) in
this world, "all the days of thy life" are to include the days of
Messiah. <span id="fr_69"></span>[6](#fn_69.md)

**T**. I. 10. We make mention of the Going forth from Egypt at nights.
R. Eleazar ben Azariah said: Lo, I was about seventy years old, and had
not the merit of hearing that the Going forth from Egypt should be said
at nights until Ben Zoma expounded it to the effect that it is said:
"*that thou mayest remember the day of thy going forth, from the land of
Egypt all the days of thy life*"; <span id="fr_70"></span>[7](#fn_70.md)

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "The days of thy
life" are the days, "all the days of thy life" are the nights. Such are
the words of Ben Zoma. But the Majority say: "the days of thy life" mean
this world, "all the days of thy life" are to include the days of
Messiah. <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71.md) Ben Zoma said to the
Majority: What! Are we to make mention of the Going forth from Egypt in
the days of Messiah? Lo, it says: "*Therefore, behold the days come,
saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, As the LORD liveth, which
brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but, As the
LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of
Israel out of the north country*," <span id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_72.md)
etc. They said to him: \[The meaning is\] not that the Going forth from
Egypt should be rooted out of their remembrance, but that you should
make \[the going forth from\] Egypt an addition to \[the deliverance
from\] the kingdoms; the kingdoms are the principal thing, and Egypt is
extra. <span id="fr_73"></span>[3](#fn_73.md) Similarly in, "Thy name shall
not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name." <span
id="fr_74"></span>[4](#fn_74.md) \[The meaning is\] not that the name of
Jacob should be rooted out from him, but that \[you should\] make Jacob
an addition to Israel—Israel is the principal thing, and Jacob is extra.

11\. Similarly \[we read\]: "*Remember ye not the former things, neither
consider the things of old*." <span id="fr_75"></span>[5](#fn_75.md)
"Remember ye not the former things"—these are the yoke of the
\[heathen\] kingdoms. "Neither consider the things of old"—these are the
yoke of Egypt. "*Behold, I will do a new thing; now shall it spring
forth; shall ye not know it?*" <span id="fr_76"></span>[6](#fn_76.md)—this
is the

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

war with Gog. <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_77.md) We may speak in
parables and ask, To what may this be compared? <span
id="fr_78"></span>[2](#fn_78.md) To one whom a wolf attacked, and he was
delivered out of its power, and he used to tell the tale of the incident
of the wolf. But afterwards a lion attacked him; and he was delivered
from it. He forgot the incident of the wolf, and used to narrate the
incident of the lion. Afterwards a serpent attacked him, and he was
delivered out of its power. He forgot the incidents of the two former,
and used to narrate the incident of the serpent. Even so with Israel—the
later calamities cause the former to be forgotten.

12\. Like unto it is: "*As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her
name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be*." <span
id="fr_79"></span>[3](#fn_79.md) At first, lo, she was princess over her
people, now, lo, she is princess over the peoples of the world, for it
is said: "for Sarah shall her name be." <span
id="fr_80"></span>[4](#fn_80.md)

13\. Like unto it is: "*Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram,
but thy name shall be Abraham*." <span id="fr_81"></span>[5](#fn_81.md) At
first, lo, thou wast father over Aram, but now, lo, thou shalt be father
for all who come into the world. <span id="fr_82"></span>[6](#fn_82.md) For
it is said: "*for the father of a multitude of nations have I set
thee*." <span id="fr_83"></span>[7](#fn_83.md)

14\. Although He afterwards called Abraham, Abram, <span
id="fr_84"></span>[8](#fn_84.md) this was not in blame but in praise;

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (and) Joshua,
Hoshea, <span id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85.md) it was not in blame but in
praise. He was Abram while God had not held converse with him, and he
was Abram after He had held converse with him. He was Hoshea while he
had not entered on \[his\] greatness, and he was Hoshea after he had
entered on \[his\] greatness. *Moses, Moses, Abraham, Abraham, Jacob,
Jacob, Samuel, Samuel*, are expressions of affection and encouragement.
They both hold good while He had not held converse with them, and both
after He had held converse with them. Thus both hold good while they had
not entered on \[their\] greatness, and both after they had entered on
\[their\] greatness.

15\. Like unto it is: "*In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his
dwelling-place in Zion*." <span id="fr_86"></span>[2](#fn_86.md) Yet, with
what object does Scripture restore to it (Jerusalem) its former
name? <span id="fr_87"></span>[3](#fn_87.md) Lo, He says: "*For this city
hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my fury*." <span
id="fr_88"></span>[4](#fn_88.md) Perchance even now it \[is mentioned\] in
anger and fury? We are expressly told: "*The mountain which God hath
desired for his abode*." <span id="fr_89"></span>[5](#fn_89.md) Lo, it \[is
mentioned\] with desire and longing. He would teach us that her
desolation hath made an atonement for her. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[6](#fn_90.md) Whence do we learn that the Shekinah does
not return to the midst of her \[Jerusalem\] until she is made a
"mountain"? We are expressly told: "*In Salem also is his tabernacle,
and his dwelling-place in Zion*," \[and\] we find that when it was
\[called\] Salem it was called a "mountain." That means to say that the
Shekinah does not return to the midst of her until she is made a
"mountain." For it is said: "*And Abraham* 

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

*called the name of that place The LORD will see: as it is said to this
day, In a mountain will the LORD be seen*." <span
id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91.md) And it says: "*Remember, O LORD, against
the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem*." When? When they root up her
foundations from her—"who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation
thereof." <span id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_92.md)

II\. 1. He who recites the Shma‘ <span id="fr_93"></span>[3](#fn_93.md)
must make mention of "the Going Forth from Egypt" in "True and
sure." <span id="fr_94"></span>[4](#fn_94.md) Rabbi says: he must make
mention in it of "Kingdom." <span id="fr_95"></span>[5](#fn_95.md) Others
say: he must make mention in it of "the smiting of the Firstborn" and
"the parting asunder of the Red Sea." <span
id="fr_96"></span>[6](#fn_96.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_64"></span>[10:1](tbr14.htm#fr_64.md) *the going forth from
Egypt*, mentioned briefly in the third Biblical part of the Shma‘ (Num.
15<sup>41</sup>) and enlarged upon in the *Ge’ullah* (*supra*, [p.
4](tbr11.htm#page_4).md).

<span id="fn_65"></span>[10:2](tbr14.htm#fr_65.md) *R. Lazar*. So C. An
abbreviation of Eleazar. Cf. Lazarus.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[10:3](tbr14.htm#fr_66.md) *Ben Zoma*. Simeon hen
Zoma flourished in the first third of the second century. A saying
attributed to him is, "If thou puttest thyself to shame in this world,
thou shalt not be put to shame by the Holy One, blessed be He, in the
world to come." (Bacher, *Die Agada der Tannaiten*, i. p. 432.)

<span id="fn_67"></span>[10:4](tbr14.htm#fr_67.md) Deut. 16<sup>3</sup>.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[10:5](tbr14.htm#fr_68.md) For "all" cannot be
superfluous. It must add something to the thought of "the days of thy
life." Ben Zoma agreed with R. Aqiba as to the value of each letter (see
[p. 5](tbr11.htm#page_5).md).

<span id="fn_69"></span>[10:6](tbr14.htm#fr_69.md) See *T*. on all this
mishna.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[10:7](tbr14.htm#fr_70.md) Deut. 16<sup>3</sup>.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[11:1](tbr14.htm#fr_71.md) So far the Mishna. The
Tosephta now adds Ben Zoma's objection to such a reference to the days
of Messiah, and the reply of the Majority, appending in §§11-15 several
illustrations of their argument.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[11:2](tbr14.htm#fr_72.md) Jer. 23<sup>7, 8</sup>.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[11:3](tbr14.htm#fr_73.md) The metaphor is that of
a meal (see [p. 47](tbr38.htm#page_47).md). Observe the common sense of the
Majority.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[11:4](tbr14.htm#fr_74.md) Gen. 35<sup>10</sup>.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[11:5](tbr14.htm#fr_75.md) Isa. 43<sup>18</sup>.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[11:6](tbr14.htm#fr_76.md) *Ibid*. *v*. 19.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[12:1](tbr14.htm#fr_77.md) *the war with Gog*. See
Ezek. xxxviii., xxxix. A summary expression for the last great attack of
the Gentile nations upon Jerusalem before the coming of the Messiah. Cf.
Rev. 20<sup>8</sup>.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[12:2](tbr14.htm#fr_78.md) Lit.: "They parable a
parable: to what is the matter like?" Cf. Mark 4<sup>30</sup> (parallel,
Luke 13<sup>18</sup>); also Luke 7<sup>31</sup>.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[12:3](tbr14.htm#fr_79.md) Gen. 17<sup>15</sup>.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[12:4](tbr14.htm#fr_80.md) The final letter of
*Sarai* may be explained as meaning "my," *i.e.* she ruled over Abraham
and his people. But *Sarah*, her proper name, suggests no such
limitation. See the Gemara, T B. 13*a*.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[12:5](tbr14.htm#fr_81.md) Gen. 17<sup>5</sup>.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[12:6](tbr14.htm#fr_82.md) *for all who come into
the world.* Cf. John. 1<sup>9</sup>.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[12:7](tbr14.htm#fr_83.md) Gen. 17<sup>5</sup>. At
first Ab-Ram = Father of Aram; afterwards the insertion of "h" suggests
Ab(r)-ham (ôn), "Father of a multitude."

<span id="fn_84"></span>[12:8](tbr14.htm#fr_84.md) Neh. 9<sup>7</sup>.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[13:1](tbr14.htm#fr_85.md) Deut. 32<sup>44</sup>.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[13:2](tbr14.htm#fr_86.md) Ps. 76<sup>2</sup>.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[13:3](tbr14.htm#fr_87.md) *its former name*.
*i.e.* Salem. This is another example of the use of a former name, and
even this was not employed in anger.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[13:4](tbr14.htm#fr_88.md) Jer. 32<sup>31</sup>.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[13:5](tbr14.htm#fr_89.md) Ps. 68<sup>18</sup>.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[13:6](tbr14.htm#fr_90.md) *an atonement for her*.
The thought that afflictions atone may be present even in Isa.
40<sup>2</sup>, and, in any case, is exceedingly common in later Jewish
books. So especially of death, see *infra*, [p. 84](tbr60.htm#page_84.md).

<span id="fn_91"></span>[14:1](tbr14.htm#fr_91.md) Gen. 22<sup>14</sup>.
But the Tosephta plays on the consonants, disregarding the traditional
interpretation.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[14:2](tbr14.htm#fr_92.md) Ps. 137<sup>7</sup>. The
Edomites made Jerusalem once more a mere mountain, and thus unwittingly
secured its further blessing.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[14:3](tbr14.htm#fr_93.md) The author is speaking
of the recitation in the morning, *cf*. [p. 4](tbr11.htm#page_4.md).

<span id="fn_94"></span>[14:4](tbr14.htm#fr_94.md) The section recalling
the Exodus (Num. 15<sup>37-41</sup>) is followed by the prayer "True and
sure" (*’Emeth wyatzib*). SA, p. 42.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[14:5](tbr14.htm#fr_95.md) The thought of God's
Kingdom is found in the present form of the prayer *’Emeth wyatzib*, and
also in the portion beginning "For the first and for the last ages."

<span id="fn_96"></span>[14:6](tbr14.htm#fr_96.md) Both these occur in the
portion beginning "Thou hast been the help of our fathers" (SA, p. 43).
