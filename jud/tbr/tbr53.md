#### Parenthesis: When the Benediction must not be said.

7 (6). They do not say a Benediction over the lamp nor over the spices
that belong to heathen; <span id="fr_424"></span>[3](#fn_423.md) nor over
the lamp nor over the spices that are for the dead; <span
id="fr_425"></span>[4](#fn_424.md) not over the lamp nor over the spices
that belong to idol-worship. <span id="fr_426"></span>[5](#fn_425.md) They
do not say a Benediction over the lamp until they enjoy its light.

**T**. VI. 7. If one has a lamp (*nêr*) hidden in his bosom, <span
id="fr_427"></span>[6](#fn_426.md) or within a lantern and sees the flame

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

without using its light, or uses its light without seeing the flame—we
do not say the Benediction <span id="fr_428"></span>[1](#fn_427.md) over it
until he sees the flame and uses its light. If it be a lantern with
glass, one says the Benediction over it, although it is not
extinguished. <span id="fr_429"></span>[2](#fn_428.md)

In the case of a lamp belonging to a Gentile we do not say the
Benediction over it. An Israelite who lights \[his lamp\] from a
Gentile's, and a Gentile who lights \[his lamp\] from an Israelite's—we
say the Benediction over it \[in each case\].

At what time does a man begin to say the Benediction? As soon as it
becomes dark. If he has not said it as soon as it becomes dark, he says
it at any time during the night. If he has not said it during all the
night, he may not say it later.

Fire <span id="fr_430"></span>[3](#fn_429.md) and hybrids <span
id="fr_431"></span>[4](#fn_430.md) were not \[made in\] the six days of
creation. But they were thought of <span id="fr_432"></span>[5](#fn_431.md)
in the six days of creation. R. Judah says: The fire of Gehinnom which
was created on the second day of creation is never extinguished. For it
is said: "*And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the
men that have transgressed against Me:* \[*for their worm shall not die,
neither shall their fire be quenched*\]." <span
id="fr_433"></span>[6](#fn_432.md)

8\. In the case of the fire and spices of a bath, <span
id="fr_434"></span>[7](#fn_433.md) one does not say the Benediction over
them. If one is standing in a spice—shop all the day one says the
Benediction only once. If one enters and goes out repeatedly, one says
the Benediction each single time.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_423"></span>[70:3](tbr53.htm#fr_424.md) *heathen*. Their light
or fire might have been kindled on sabbath, or even their spices used
for idolatry.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[70:4](tbr53.htm#fr_425.md) *that are for the
dead*. The lamp is therefore not used for light, but for the honour of
the dead, and lends itself to superstition. Similarly the burning of
spices over the dead may be only for health's sake, or from
superstitious motives.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[70:5](tbr53.htm#fr_426.md) *idol-worship*. The
"heathen" are mentioned above as regards possession; this phrase refers
to the use of lamp or spices although the exact ownership is not known.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[70:6](tbr53.htm#fr_427.md) *in his bosom*
(*chêqo*). One MS. of *T*. J., *Berakoth* VIII. 7 (12<sup>b</sup>),
edited by *M*. Lehmann, 1875, reads *tiqo*, "his case" (θήκη), and this
is preferred by Laible.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[71:1](tbr53.htm#fr_428.md) *the Benediction*,
over the sabbath light kindled just before the entrance of sabbath.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[71:2](tbr53.htm#fr_429.md) It has been burning
before sabbath, and will continue to burn.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[71:3](tbr53.htm#fr_430.md) *Fire*. Introducing
the fire of Gehenna, which burns continually.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[71:4](tbr53.htm#fr_431.md) *hybrids*. These are
discussed in the parallel passage, *T*. J. VIII. 6 (12<sup>b</sup>).

<span id="fn_431"></span>[71:5](tbr53.htm#fr_432.md) *thought of*. So
plainly in *T.J*.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[71:6](tbr53.htm#fr_433.md) Isa. 66<sup>24</sup>.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[71:7](tbr53.htm#fr_434.md) *the fire and spices
of a bath*. They do not properly belong to the idea of a sabbath.
