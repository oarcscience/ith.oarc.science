<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>five. If there are six they may be
divided, and so up to ten. <span id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_394.md) But not
ten until there be twenty.

**T**. V. 19. In the case of twenty persons they are divided \[into two
groups\], provided that there be none among them who separated himself
from the invitation. <span id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_395.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_388"></span>[63:1](tbr44.htm#fr_389.md) B. adds: "In the case
of a thousand besides the speaker, he says, Bless ye. In the case of a
myriad one says, Let us bless the Loan our God, the God of Israel, the
God of hosts, who dwelleth between the cherubim, over the meal that we
have eaten."

<span id="fn_389"></span>[63:2](tbr44.htm#fr_390.md) *According to the
wording of his blessing*. C has, literally, "According to the subject
which he says, blesses" (sic).

<span id="fn_390"></span>[63:3](tbr44.htm#fr_391.md) Ps. 68<sup>26</sup>.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[63:4](tbr44.htm#fr_392.md) *in the synagogue*.
Where people are going and coming, so that their number is not known, in
contrast to a private meal, where it is. Aqiba implies that the practice
in the synagogue should guide that elsewhere. Cf. [p.
69](tbr51.htm#page_69.md).

<span id="fn_392"></span>[63:5](tbr44.htm#fr_393) The *Halaka* (Rule.md)
follows R. Ishmael (Bartenora).

<span id="fn_393"></span>[63:6](tbr45.htm#fr_394.md) *to separate*. Into
two or more divisions, to say the Grace after the meal. For three is the
lowest number for a religious company. Therefore four or five may not be
divided. Cf. [p. 50](tbr40.htm#page_50.md).

<span id="fn_394"></span>[64:1](tbr45.htm#fr_395.md) *ten*. For ten also is
a company. Therefore also the numbers from eleven to nineteen may not be
divided.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[64:2](tbr45.htm#fr_396.md) *from the invitation*.
By having already said the Benediction for himself.
