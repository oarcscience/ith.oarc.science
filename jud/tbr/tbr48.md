#### The Order of Washing Hands, and Mixing the Cup.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VIII. 2. The School of Shammai say:
Men wash their hands <span id="fr_405"></span>[4](#fn_404) and
afterwards mix the cup. And the School of Hillel say: Men mix the cup
and afterwards wash their hands. <span id="fr_406"></span>[5](#fn_405)

**T**. VI. 2. The School of Shammai say: Men wash their hands, and
afterwards mix the cup. Perchance \[any\] moisture which is on the
outside of the cup <span id="fr_407"></span>[6](#fn_406) becomes unclean
through the hands, and makes the cup unclean again.

But the School of Hillel say: The outside of the cup is unclean in any
case. Another reason \[given\]

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

is: The washing of hands is only joined to a meal. (Hence) men mix the
cup, and after that wash their hands. <span
id="fr_408"></span>[1](#fn_407)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_404"></span>[66:4](tbr48.htm#fr_405) *wash their hands*. By
pouring water over them.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[66:5](tbr48.htm#fr_406) On this mishna see
*T*.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[66:6](tbr48.htm#fr_407) *on the outside of the
cup*. Hence the need to clean the outside, Matt. 23<sup>25</sup>.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[67:1](tbr48.htm#fr_408) *wash their hands*.
The common . text adds: "For if thou sayest, men wash first, perchance
the liquid on the hands will become unclean through the cup, and will
make the hands unclean again. But they mix the cup, and afterwards wash
their hands." The meaning is that if the hands are damp from washing,
and one takes hold of a cup whose outside is already unclean, the hands
then become unclean and one would eat with unclean hands.
