#### The Order of the Benedictions over Wine and Food: When "Amen" may not be said.

9 (8). Suppose that wine comes to them after the food, and there is
there only that \[one\] cup, <span id="fr_438"></span>[4](#fn_437) the
School of Shammai say: One says the Benediction over the wine, and
afterwards the Benediction over the food. But the School of Hillel say:
One says the Benediction over the food, and afterwards the Benediction
over the wine. <span id="fr_439"></span>[5](#fn_438) They answer "Amen"
after an Israelite who says the Benediction, but they do not say "Amen"
after a Cuthæan (*i.e.* 

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span> Samaritan) who says the Benediction, until one hears
all the Benediction. <span id="fr_440"></span>[1](#fn_439)

**T**. III. 26. We answer "Amen" after an Israelite when he is saying
the Benediction, but we do not answer "Amen" after a Samaritan when he
is saying the Benediction, until one hears the whole of the
Benediction. <span id="fr_441"></span>[2](#fn_440)

V. 21. In the case of a heathen who says the Benediction in the Name (of
the Loan), they respond "Amen" after him. In the case of a Samaritan who
says the Benediction in the Name (of the LORD), they do not respond
"Amen" after him until the whole Benediction is heard. <span
id="fr_442"></span>[3](#fn_441)

22\. If one is offering sacrifices <span id="fr_443"></span>[4](#fn_442)
in Jerusalem <span id="fr_444"></span>[5](#fn_443) one says: "Blessed be
He who hath brought us to this time"; and when they eat one says:
"Blessed be He who sanctified us by His commands, and commanded us to
eat this sacrifice." If one is offering meal-offerings in Jerusalem one
says: "Blessed be He who kept us alive and brought us to this time";
when they eat he says: "Blessed be He who bringeth forth bread from the
earth."

23\. If ten are walking on a journey, although they all eat of one
loaf, <span id="fr_445"></span>[6](#fn_444) each single one says the
Benediction for himself. If they have sat down to eat, although each
single one eats of his own loaf, one says the Benediction for them
all. <span id="fr_446"></span>[7](#fn_445)

24\. In the case of workmen who are doing their work near the master of
the house, behold, these say two Benedictions. One says the first
Benediction,

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

and he includes that for Jerusalem <span id="fr_447"></span>[1](#fn_446)
along with that for the Land, <span id="fr_448"></span>[2](#fn_447) and
seals it with that for the Land. If they are working with him for their
food, <span id="fr_449"></span>[3](#fn_448) or the master of the house
says the Benediction for them, they say four Benedictions. <span
id="fr_450"></span>[4](#fn_449)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_437"></span>[72:4](tbr55.htm#fr_438) *that* \[*one*\]
*cup*. No other wine having been drunk during the meal, *cf*. *M*. VI.
8.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[72:5](tbr55.htm#fr_439) *and afterwards the
Benediction over the wine*. Presumably the School of Shammai feared that
the blessing over the wine might be forgotten if that for the food was
given first. But the School of Hillel did not consider that there was
any danger of this, for the Benediction over the food could not include
that over the wine, so it might be said first.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[73:1](tbr55.htm#fr_440) See *T*.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[73:2](tbr55.htm#fr_441) See [p.
9](tbr13.htm#page_9).

<span id="fn_441"></span>[73:3](tbr55.htm#fr_442) A heathen proselyte
has learned the ordinary Jewish form. But a Samaritan may say something
heretical.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[73:4](tbr55.htm#fr_443) *sacrifices*. *i.e.*
animal.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[73:5](tbr55.htm#fr_444) *in Jerusalem*. This
seems therefore to be earlier than 70 A.D., unless the rule is purely
academic. That no sacrifices were offered after the destruction see
Schürer, *Geschichte* <sup>4</sup>, I. 652-655 (E. *T*. I. ii. 268-272).

<span id="fn_444"></span>[73:6](tbr55.htm#fr_445) 1 Cor.
10<sup>17</sup>.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[73:7](tbr55.htm#fr_446) If it is to be a
common meal all must sit down.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[74:1](tbr55.htm#fr_447) *that for Jerusalem*.
The third Benediction in the Grace after meals (SA, p. 282).

<span id="fn_447"></span>[74:2](tbr55.htm#fr_448) *that for the Land*.
The second (SA, p. 280).

<span id="fn_448"></span>[74:3](tbr55.htm#fr_449) *for their food*. Not
for wages.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[74:4](tbr55.htm#fr_450) *they say four
Benedictions*, *i.e.* to themselves, saying the "Amen" aloud after their
master. Observe that in the first case the master would not want his men
to spend more time away from their work than was necessary. In the
second case he would not so much mind.
