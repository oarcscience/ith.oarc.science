#### On One Benediction exempting Another.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VI. 5. If a man has said the
Benediction over the wine that comes before the meal he lets the wine
that is after the meal go free. <span id="fr_298"></span>[3](#fn_297.md) If
he has said the Benediction over the *hors d'œuvre* that is before the
meal, he lets the *hors d’œuvre* that comes after the meal go free. If
he has said the Benediction over the piece of bread he lets the *hors
d’œuvre* go free; if over the *hors d’œuvres* <span
id="fr_299"></span>[4](#fn_298.md) he does not let the piece of bread go
free. The school of Shammai says: nor anything that is cooked in the
pot. <span id="fr_300"></span>[5](#fn_299.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_295"></span>[47:1](tbr38.htm#fr_296.md) Cf. M. VI. 8.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[47:2](tbr38.htm#fr_297.md) *rice*. Not one of the
"seven" kinds (see [p. 53](tbr40.htm#page_53).md), or the five seeds (see
[p. 46](tbr38.htm#page_46).md).

<span id="fn_297"></span>[47:3](tbr39.htm#fr_298.md) *lets . . . go free*.
Literally "he exempts the wine that is after the meal," and so always in
this phrase. The present regulation refers only to sabbaths and
feast-days, on which a man intends when he says the Benediction over the
wine before the meal to partake of wine also after the meal (Bartenora).

<span id="fn_298"></span>[47:4](tbr39.htm#fr_299.md) *the* hors d’œuvres*.*
The plural suggests that there may be more than one.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[47:5](tbr39.htm#fr_300.md) *nor anything that is
cooked in the pot*. Such as groats.
