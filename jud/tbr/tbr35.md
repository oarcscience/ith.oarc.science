#### Three Examples of Benedictions at Wrong Times. On Mistakes made by the Leader.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>V. 3. He that saith: "Over a bird's
nest <span id="fr_259"></span>[3](#fn_258.md) do Thy mercies extend," and
"For good let Thy name be remembered," <span
id="fr_260"></span>[4](#fn_259.md) and "We praise, we praise," <span
id="fr_261"></span>[5](#fn_260.md) must be stopped. As for him that passes
before the Ark <span id="fr_262"></span>[6](#fn_261.md) and makes a mistake
let another pass in his stead. Let him not decline \[when asked to say
prayers at that time\]. Where does he begin? At the beginning of the
Benediction in which he \[the former\] made the mistake.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>4. He <span
id="fr_263"></span>[1](tbr36.htm#fn_262.md) that passes before the Ark must
not answer Amen after the priests <span
id="fr_264"></span>[2](tbr36.htm#fn_263.md) \[for fear of\] distraction. If
no priest is there he must not lift up his hands \[to bless\]. But if he
has confidence that if he lifts up his hands <span
id="fr_265"></span>[3](tbr36.htm#fn_264.md) \[to bless\] he can return to
his prayer, he is permitted to do so.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_256"></span>[40:1](tbr34.htm#fr_257.md) *the cup*. At the end
of the sabbath, SA, p. 216.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[40:2](tbr34.htm#fr_258.md) *the thanksgiving for
the lan*d. In the Benediction after the meal, SA, p. 280. The Erfurt
text is ungrammatical, but the Vienna and the ordinary text read "who
has not made mention of the covenant in the Benediction for the land."
The covenant is "that which Thou hast sealed in our flesh."

<span id="fn_258"></span>[40:3](tbr35.htm#fr_259.md) *Over a bird's nest*.
Deut. 22<sup>7</sup>. The prayer would continue "and therefore have
mercy upon us." But this implies that Deut. 22<sup>7</sup> was recorded
to exhibit God's mercy. It was not so. For otherwise God would not allow
birds and beasts to be killed. That passage is to be accepted as God's
decree, without our making use of it for such a purpose (*Tosaphoth Yom
Tob*). It is possible, as the following cases are connected with
heretical opinions, that the remembrance of Matt. 10<sup>29</sup> may
also have had some influence.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[40:4](tbr35.htm#fr_260.md) *For good, etc*. It
seems to deny that evil is permitted by God as well as good.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[40:5](tbr35.htm#fr_261.md) *We praise, we
praise*. Twice over. The speaker may be referring to more than one
divine principle (*cf*. the next mishna and *M*. IX. 8 (5), [p.
87](tbr63.htm#page_87.md), and the common argument for the Trinity from the
threefold use of "Holy" in Isa. vi. 3).

<span id="fn_261"></span>[40:6](tbr35.htm#fr_262.md) *him passes before the
Ark*. [p. 19](tbr18.htm#page_19.md) note. It was correct for him who was
invited to lead the Tephillah to decline the first time, but to yield to
a second and third invitation (Gemara *T*. B. 34<sup>a</sup>).
