#### The Recitation of the Shma‘ if a Relation is Dead, and at the Burial.

III\. 1. He whose dead lieth before him <span
id="fr_141"></span>[6](#fn_141.md) is exempt from the recitation of the
Shma‘, <span id="fr_142"></span>[7](#fn_142.md)† and from the
Phylacteries. <span id="fr_143"></span>[7](#fn_142.md)† In the case of
those who

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>carry the bier, and them who take
their places, and them who take the places of these, <span
id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_143.md) including those who are in front of the
bier and those who are behind it, and also those who are required for
the bier—they are under obligation to recite the Shma‘. Both classes are
exempt from the Prayer. <span id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_144.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_141"></span>[21:6](tbr22.htm#fr_141.md) *before him*. In the
house, unburied.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[21:7](tbr22.htm#fr_143.md) †† So C. But B has
"and from the Tephillah, and from all the commandments that were spoken
in the Law."

<span id="fn_143"></span>[22:1](tbr22.htm#fr_144.md) *who take the places
of these*. For it is meritorious to assist in carrying the corpse.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[22:2](tbr22.htm#fr_145.md) This appears to he the
meaning of C. But the text is in great disorder, and B runs: "They that
carry the bier, and they who take their places, and they who take the
places of these, including those who are in front of the bier, and those
who are behind it—as for those who are in front of the bier, if they are
required, they are exempt (from reciting the Shma‘); and as for those
that are after the bier, if they are required they are under obligation
(to recite the Shma‘); but both alike are exempt from the Prayer."
