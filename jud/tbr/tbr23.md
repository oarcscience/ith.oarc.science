#### After the Burial.

2\. When they have buried the dead person and have returned, then if
they are able to begin and to finish, <span
id="fr_146"></span>[3](#fn_145) before they reach the line \[of
mourners\] <span id="fr_147"></span>[4](#fn_146) let them begin. But if
they cannot, let them not begin. They who are standing in the inner line
are exempt, but the outer are under obligation \[to recite the Shma‘\].

**T**. II. 11. When they have buried the dead person and are standing in
a row. They in the inner row which sees the face (of the bearers) are
free (from obligation to recite), but they in that which does not see
the face are under obligation. R. Judah says: If only one row is there
they that attend out

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

of respect are under obligation, they that attend as mourners are free.
Suppose they have gone down for the lamentations, they who see the face
are free, but they who form the second row after them are under
obligation, and all they who take part in the lamentations leave off for
the recitation of the Shma‘, but do not leave off for the Prayer. It is
recorded that once our Rabbis left off for the recital of the Shma‘ and
for the Prayer.

stand in two parallel rows while the mourners pass between them, and to
say, 'May God console you together with all those who mourn for Zion and
Jerusalem'" (Jewish Encyclopedia, v. 530).
