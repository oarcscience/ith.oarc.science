#### The Words of the Invitation depend on the Number Present.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VII. 4 (3). How is the invitation
worded? <span id="fr_385"></span>[1](#fn_384) In the case of three
persons they say: "Let us bless." <span id="fr_386"></span>[2](#fn_385)
If there are three besides the speaker, he says: "Blessed be He." <span
id="fr_387"></span>[3](#fn_386) If there are ten he says: "Let us bless
our God." If there are ten besides the speaker he says: "Blessed be He."
It is all the same whether there be ten or ten myriads. <span
id="fr_388"></span>[4](#fn_387)

5 (3 *cont*.). In the case of a hundred he says: "Let us bless the LORD
our God." In the case of a hundred besides the speaker he says: "Blessed
be He." In the case of a thousand they say: "Let

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>us bless the LORD our God, the God
of Israel, the God of hosts." <span
id="fr_389"></span>[1](tbr45.htm#fn_388)

In the case of a myriad besides the speaker, he says: "Blessed be He."
According to the wording of his blessing <span
id="fr_390"></span>[2](tbr45.htm#fn_389) so do they respond after him:
"Blessed be the LORD our God, the God of Israel, the God of hosts,
dwelling between the cherubim for the meal that we have eaten."

R. Jose, the Galilean, says: According to the number of the congregation
do they frame the Benediction, for it is said, "By congregations bless
ye God the LORD, from the fountain of Israel." <span
id="fr_391"></span>[3](tbr45.htm#fn_390)

6 (3 *cont*.). R. Aqiba says: How do we find it in the synagogue? <span
id="fr_392"></span>[4](tbr45.htm#fn_391) It is all one whether there be
many or few; they say, Bless ye the LORD." R. Ishmael says: "Bless ye
the LORD who is blessed." <span id="fr_393"></span>[5](tbr45.htm#fn_392)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_384"></span>[62:1](tbr44.htm#fr_385) *How is the invitation
worded?* The formulæ are essentially the same as in SA, p. 279. See also
Abrahams' notes.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[62:2](tbr44.htm#fr_386) "*Let us bless*."
Observe the gradation. Here no name is mentioned, for ten alone is a
fully religious assembly; where there are ten, "our God"; where a
hundred, "the LORD our God" where a thousand, "the LORD our God, the God
of Israel, the God of hosts"; where a myriad, there is the addition of
"dwelling between the cherubims."

<span id="fn_386"></span>[62:3](tbr44.htm#fr_387) *Blessed be He*. B has
"Bless ye" wherever "Blessed be He" comes in this and the next mishna
(in C.).

<span id="fn_387"></span>[62:4](tbr44.htm#fr_388) *myriads*. See the
next mishna (in C.).
