#### Posture in Reciting the Shma‘.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>I. 5 (3): The School of
Shammai <span id="fr_38"></span>[4](#fn_38.md) say: In the evening all
should turn on their side, <span id="fr_39"></span>[5](#fn_39.md) and so
recite, and in the morning stand, for it is said: "*and when thou liest
down, and when thou risest up*." <span id="fr_40"></span>[6](#fn_40.md) But
the School of Hillel say: Every one recites according to his own way,
for it is said: "*and when thou* 

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>*goest in the way*." <span
id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) If so, why is there said: "and when thou
liest down and when thou risest up?" This refers to the time when men
are in the habit (lit. way) of lying down, and the time when they are in
the habit of standing.

6\. (3 *cont*.). R. Tarphon <span id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md) said: I
was on a journey and I turned on my side to recite in accordance with
the School of Shammai, and I put myself in danger because of robbers.
They said to him: Thou didst deserve to be guilty of thy own life
because thou didst trangress the words of the School of Hillel.

**T**. I. 4. An incident is told of R. Ishmael <span
id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_43.md) and R. Eleazar ben Azariah, that they were
resting in a certain place, and R. Ishmael had turned on his side and R.
Eleazar ben Azariah was upright. When the time of reciting the Shma‘
arrived, R. Ishmael was upright and R. Eleazar ben Azariah was turned on
his side. R. Ishmael said to him: What is this, Eleazar? He said to him:
Brother Ishmael, people asked a man, Why so fine a beard? He said to
them, With a view to the barbers. <span id="fr_44"></span>[4](#fn_44.md) So

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I who was upright
turned on my side, and thou who wast on thy side raised thyself upright.
He \[*i.e.* R. Ishmael\] said to him: Thou didst turn on thy side to
fulfil \[the Law\] according to the opinion of the School of Shammai,
and I stood upright to fulfil \[it\] according to the opinion of the
School of Hillel. <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](tbr13.htm#fn_45.md) According
to another account, that the disciples should not see \[what we do\],
and make a fixed rule according to thy opinion.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_35"></span>[5:1](tbr11.htm#fr_35.md) *R. Judah ben Il‘ai*, in
the third generation of mishna teachers, 130-160 A.D., and so always
with "R. Judah" alone.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[5:2](tbr11.htm#fr_36.md) *R. Aqiba*. Put to death
by the Romans c. 132 A.D. for helping Barcochba. He insisted on the
inspiration of every letter of Scripture, and Aquila's over-literal
translation was made under his influence. He formed a kind of mishna,
which was used by R. Judah (see Strack, p. 19).

<span id="fn_37"></span>[5:3](tbr11.htm#fr_37.md) *R. Eleazar ben Azariah*.
A wealthy priest and an elder contemporary of R. Aqiba. Said to be a
descendant of Ezra.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[5:4](tbr12.htm#fr_38.md) *Shammai*. He and Hillel
flourished in the last quarter of the first century B.C. The followers
of Shammai and of Hillel formed the two principal divisions of the
Pharisees, the Shammaites being much the stricter, and being the leading
party until 70 A.D. Some of our Lord's words about the Pharisees have
special reference to them.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[5:5](tbr12.htm#fr_39.md) To-day, as of old, the
Shma‘ is usually recited in a sitting posture (SA, p. lvi).

<span id="fn_40"></span>[5:6](tbr12.htm#fr_40.md) Deut. 6<sup>7</sup>.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[6:1](tbr12.htm#fr_41.md) Deut. 6<sup>7</sup>.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[6:2](tbr12.htm#fr_42.md) *R. Tarphon*. He had
attended the Temple service in his youth, but flourished in the first
quarter of the second century A.D. He is sometimes identified with the
Trypho of Justin's *Dialogue*, but, apart from the question of date (for
Trypho does not give the impression of being at all an old man), rather
absurdly, for the latter shows very little acquaintance with Jewish
casuistry.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[6:3](tbr12.htm#fr_43.md) *R. Ishmael ben Elisha*
was a contemporary of R. Aqiba, and a pupil of R. Nechuniah ben ha-Qanah
(see [p. 30](tbr27.htm#page_30).md). He lived on the border of Edom, and
his hermeneutical principles differed from those of R. Aqiba, for he
taught that the words of Scripture should be interpreted by the general
usage of human speech. His influence may be seen especially in the
*Mekilta* (the midrash on Exodus), and in the *Siphre* (on Numbers and
Deuteronomy).

<span id="fn_44"></span>[6:4](tbr12.htm#fr_44.md) *barbers*. The narrative
is given also in the *Siphre* on Deut. 6<sup>7</sup> (ed. Friedmann, P.
74<sup>b</sup>), and the *Yalqut* on the same passage <span
id="page_7">p. 7</span>(§ 842). The meaning of Eleazar's words seems to
be, Your praise of my beard means that it is fit for the barbers, and
must he cut short. I, by lying down, showed my agreement with you, but
you then stood upright to show you did not accept my approval. It is a
case in which praise produces the opposite.
