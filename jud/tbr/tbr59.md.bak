#### Parenthesis:—Prayers in Vain.

4\. (3 *cont*.). One utters over evil the abstract for good, and over
good the abstract <span id="fr_472"></span>[5](#fn_471.md) for evil <span
id="fr_473"></span>[6](#fn_472.md) He that calleth out for what is already
past—lo, this is a prayer in vain.

5\. (3 *cont*.). How so? If his wife is with child and he says: "May it
be Thy pleasure that my wife bears a male child"—lo, this is a prayer in
vain. <span id="fr_474"></span>[7](#fn_473.md) Or if he is on a journey,
and hears shrieks in the city, and says: "May it be Thy pleasure that
these be not in my house"—lo, this is a prayer in vain. <span
id="fr_475"></span>[8](#fn_474.md)

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

T. VII. 7. R. Meir used to say: Behold, it says, "*And thou shalt love
the LORD thy God with all thy heart*," <span
id="fr_476"></span>[1](#fn_475.md) etc.—with thy two natures, with thy good
nature and with thy evil nature. "*With all thy soul*,"—even when He
takes away thy soul. Another explanation is: "With all thy soul,"
with <span id="fr_477"></span>[2](#fn_476.md) the soul which He created in
thee, for it is said: "*Let my soul live, and it shall praise
Thee*." <span id="fr_478"></span>[3](#fn_477.md) And it says: "*All my
bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto Thee?*" <span
id="fr_479"></span>[4](#fn_478.md) Ben Azzai says: "With all thy
soul,"—Give thy soul to His commandments. There are words which are
foolish prayers. <span id="fr_480"></span>[5](#fn_479.md) How so? A man
gathers a hundred *kors*, <span id="fr_481"></span>[6](#fn_480.md) and
says, May it be Thy good pleasure that they be two hundred. A man
collects a hundred flasks <span id="fr_482"></span>[7](#fn_481.md) and
says: May it be Thy good pleasure that they be two hundred. Behold this
is a prayer in vain. But he ought to pray that a blessing be gathered
with them, and not a curse.

8\. R. Dosethai bar Jannai, <span id="fr_483"></span>[8](#fn_482.md) says
in the name of R. Meir: Behold, He saith in \[the passage about\]
Isaac: <span id="fr_484"></span>[9](#fn_483.md) "*And I will bless thee,
and will multiply thy seed*." <span id="fr_485"></span>[10](#fn_484.md)
Isaac expounded the words and said: Seeing that no blessing rests on one
save by the work of one's hands—he arose and sowed. <span
id="fr_486"></span>[11](#fn_485.md) For

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

<span class="margnote">T.</span>

it is said: "*And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in that year a
hundred measures*," etc., and a hundred quantities. <span
id="fr_487"></span>[1](#fn_486.md) A hundred measures, for they measured
them a hundred times, for each one there was a hundred in what they
measured. <span id="fr_488"></span>[2](#fn_487.md)

9\. He who performs any commandment must say a Benediction. He who makes
himself a *sukkah* <span id="fr_489"></span>[3](#fn_488.md) says: "Blessed
be He who enabled us to reach this season." <span
id="fr_490"></span>[4](#fn_489.md) When he enters in to dwell in it he
says: "Blessed be He who sanctified us by His commandments, and
commanded us to dwell in a *sukkah*." And when he has said the
Benediction over it on the first day, he need not say the Benediction
again.

10\. He that makes himself a *Lulab* <span
id="fr_491"></span>[5](#fn_490.md) says: "Blessed be He who brought us to
this time," and when he takes it up he says: "Blessed be He who
sanctified us by His commandments, and commanded us concerning the
taking up of the Lulab," and he must say the Benediction over it, all
the seven days (of the Festival).

He that makes for himself *Tsitsith* <span
id="fr_492"></span>[6](#fn_491.md) says: "Blessed be He who brought us to
this time," when he wraps himself in (the shawl on which they are) he
says: "to wrap oneself in Tsitsith."

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

<span class="margnote">T.</span>

He that makes for himself *Tephillin* <span
id="fr_493"></span>[1](#fn_492.md) says: "Blessed be he who brought us to
this time," and when he lays them <span id="fr_494"></span>[2](#fn_493.md)
he says: "Who sanctified us by His commandments, and commanded us to lay
*Tephillin*." When does he begin to lay them? At dawn. If he has not
laid them at dawn, he lays them at any time in the day.

11\. He who kills an animal for food <span
id="fr_495"></span>[3](#fn_494.md) needs a Benediction for himself. He
says: "Who sanctified us by His commandments, and commanded us
concerning slaughter."

He who covers blood needs a Benediction for himself concerning the
covering of blood.

12\. He who performs the ceremony of circumcision <span
id="fr_496"></span>[4](#fn_495.md) needs a Benediction for himself. He
says: "Who sanctified us by His commandments, and commanded us
concerning circumcision."

The father of the boy needs a Benediction for himself: "Blessed be He
who sanctified us by His commandments, and commanded us to make him
enter into the covenant of Abraham our father."

And they that stand by say: "As Thou hast made him enter the covenant,
so mayest Thou make him enter the law and the marriage canopy."

13\. He who says the Benediction <span id="fr_497"></span>[5](#fn_496.md)
says: "He who sanctified the beloved <span
id="fr_498"></span>[6](#fn_497.md) from the womb set a statute in his
flesh; his offspring did He seal <span id="fr_499"></span>[7](#fn_498.md)
with the sign of the holy covenant. Therefore in reward for this did the
living God, our Portion and our

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

Rock, give commandment to deliver <span id="fr_500"></span>[1](#fn_499.md)
the beloved of our race for the sake of His covenant which He set in our
flesh. Blessed be He who maketh the covenant!" <span
id="fr_501"></span>[2](#fn_500.md)

14\. He who makes a journey to separate Contributions <span
id="fr_502"></span>[3](#fn_501.md) and Tithes says: "Blessed be He who
sanctified us to separate Contribution and Tithes." When does he begin
to say the Benediction over them? At the moment that he separates them.

15\. In the case of ten persons who are performing ten religious duties,
each single person says a Benediction for himself. If all of them are
performing one religious duty, one says the Benediction for them all. A
single person who performs ten religious duties says a Benediction over
each one. If he is performing one religious duty, the whole day, he says
the Benediction only once. If he leaves off and then goes on performing
it, he says one over each single time \[that he begins afresh\].

<span id="fn_471"></span>[78:5](tbr59.htm#fr_472.md) *the abstract*. See
*M*. IV. 3 note ([p. 30](tbr27.htm#page_30).md).

<span id="fn_472"></span>[78:6](tbr59.htm#fr_473.md) *for good . . . for
evil*, SA, p. 292.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[78:7](tbr59.htm#fr_474.md) *a prayer in vain*.
Yet the Rule is that such a prayer may be made until the 40th day after
conception (T.B. 60<sup>a</sup>).

<span id="fn_474"></span>[78:8](tbr59.htm#fr_475.md) Because in each case
the fact is already fixed.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[79:1](tbr59.htm#fr_476.md) Deut. 6<sup>5</sup>.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[79:2](tbr59.htm#fr_477.md) *with*. Laible takes
this as "for," which may be right.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[79:3](tbr59.htm#fr_478.md) Ps. 119<sup>175</sup>.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[79:4](tbr59.htm#fr_479.md) Ps. 35<sup>10</sup>.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[79:5](tbr59.htm#fr_480.md) *foolish prayers*. Cf.
*M*.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[79:6](tbr59.htm#fr_481.md) *kors*. The *kor* was
a dry measure equivalent to a *homer*, about 80 gallons.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[79:7](tbr59.htm#fr_482) flasks (*chabiyoth*.md).
Earthen vessels used, in this case, for holding wine; of no fixed size.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[79:8](tbr59.htm#fr_483.md) *R. Dosethai bar
Jannai*. In the fourth generation of mishna-teachers, c. 160-200 A.D.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[79:9](tbr59.htm#fr_484.md) in \[the passage
about\] Isaac. Cf. Mark 12<sup>26</sup> "in \[the place concerning\] the
Bush;" and perhaps Rom. 112 "in Elijah." *Vide supra*, [p.
36](tbr33.htm#page_36.md).

<span id="fn_484"></span>[79:10](tbr59.htm#fr_485.md) Verbally in Gen.
26<sup>24</sup>, but essentially in vv. 3, *sq*., which makes it easier
for ver. 12 to be quoted immediately. But in any case "there is no
before nor after in the Law" (T. B. *Pesachim*, 6<sup>b</sup>).

<span id="fn_485"></span>[79:11](tbr59.htm#fr_486.md) *he arose and sowed*.
For the anacoluthon Laible compares Matt. 9<sup>6</sup>.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[80:1](tbr59.htm#fr_487.md) *a hundred
quantities*. Zuckermandel's text has "kinds" (*minim*), but read
*minyanim*, with the *Breshith Rabba*, § 64, on Gen. 26<sup>12</sup>.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[80:2](tbr59.htm#fr_488.md) *in what they
measured*. Rashi on Gen, 26<sup>12</sup> says, "For they valued it (the
land), how much it was likely to produce, and it produced a hundred for
each one they valued it."

<span id="fn_488"></span>[80:3](tbr59.htm#fr_489.md) *a sukkah*. Every Jew
must observe the Feast of Tabernacles by making, and, as far as
possible, living in, a booth, *i.e.* a structure of which the essential
part is the roof. This is made of branches which must not be so closely
interwoven as to prevent three stars being seen through it.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[80:4](tbr59.htm#fr_490.md) *who enabled us to
reach this season*. These are the closing words of the meditation given
in SA, p. 232, which also includes the next prayer.

<span id="fn_490"></span>[80:5](tbr59.htm#fr_491.md) *a Lulab*. *Vide
supra*, [p. 33](tbr31.htm#page_33.md).

<span id="fn_491"></span>[80:6](tbr59.htm#fr_492.md) *Tsitsith*. *Vide
supra*, [p. 16](tbr16.htm#page_16.md).

<span id="fn_492"></span>[81:1](tbr59.htm#fr_493.md) *Tephillin*, or
Phylacteries. *Vide supra*, [p. 17](tbr17.htm#page_17.md).

<span id="fn_493"></span>[81:2](tbr59.htm#fr_494.md) *lays them*. *i.e.*
binds them on head or arm.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[81:3](tbr59.htm#fr_495.md) *He who kills an
animal for food*. The Hebrew word is *ha-shôchēt*.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[81:4](tbr59.htm#fr_496.md) *circumcision*. The
service may be found in SA, pp. 304 *sq*., where the prayers here
mentioned are incorporated.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[81:5](tbr59.htm#fr_497.md) *He who says the
Benediction*. In SA, p. 304, the *Mohel* himself, *i.e.* he who
circumcises the child. The following prayer is on p. 305.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[81:6](tbr59.htm#fr_498.md) *the beloved*. Isaac,
Gen. 22<sup>2</sup>, "thine only son," R.V.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[81:7](tbr59.htm#fr_499.md) *seal*. Cf. Rom.
4<sup>11</sup>.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[82:1](tbr59.htm#fr_500.md) *to deliver*. The
Vienna MS., the common text, and T. J. IX. 4 (3), p. 14<sup>a</sup>
bottom, add "from the pit." And so T. B. *Sabb*. 137<sup>b</sup>, where
Rashi explains, "from Gehenna," for no circumcised person stays in
Gehenna always.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[82:2](tbr59.htm#fr_501.md) The common text adds
Benedictions to be used at the circumcision of proselytes and slaves,
taken from *T*. B. Sabb. 137<sup>b</sup>.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[82:3](tbr59.htm#fr_502.md) *Contributions*. See
[p. 59](tbr41.htm#page_59.md).

<span id="fn_502"></span>[82:4](tbr60.htm#fr_503.md) The prayers are given
in *T*.
