#### On Reciting the Shma‘ inaudibly or irregularly.

4\. (3). He who recites the Shma‘ not loud enough for himself to hear
has fulfilled his obligation. R. Jose <span
id="fr_109"></span>[4](#fn_109) says he has not. If he has recited
without expressing the letters exactly, R. Jose says he has fulfilled
his obligation. R. Judah says he has not. He who recites in an irregular
order <span id="fr_110"></span>[5](#fn_110) has not fulfilled his
obligation. If he has recited and made a mistake he must return to the
place where he made the mistake.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

**T**. II. 3. He who recites the Shma‘ in an irregular order has not
fulfilled his duty, and so also in the Hallel, <span
id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_111) and so in the Prayer, <span
id="fr_112"></span>[2](#fn_112) and so in the Roll. <span
id="fr_113"></span>[3](#fn_113)

4\. He who recites the Shma‘ and makes a mistake, and leaves out one
verse in it, must not begin and recite that verse by itself, <span
id="fr_114"></span>[4](#fn_114) but he begins with that verse and
finishes until the end, and so in the Hallel, and so in the Prayer, and
so in the Roll. He who enters into the synagogue and finds that the
congregation have said half the Shma‘, and finishes with them, should
not begin and recite from the beginning of it as far as that place, but
begins from the beginning and finishes to the end. And so in the Hallel,
and so in the Prayer, and so in the Roll.

5\. He who is reciting the Shma‘ and makes a mistake and does not know
where he made it, returns to the beginning of it. If he has made the
mistake in the middle of the section <span
id="fr_115"></span>[5](#fn_115) he returns to the beginning of the
section; if he has made the mistake between the first \[verse\]
\[where\] "write" \[is said\] and the second, <span
id="fr_116"></span>[6](#fn_116) he returns to the first.

6\. They who are engaged in writing books of Scripture, Tephillin, <span
id="fr_117"></span>[7](#fn_117) and Mezuzoth, <span
id="fr_118"></span>[8](#fn_118) break off

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

their task for the recitation of the Shma‘, but do not break off for the
Prayer. Rabbi says: Just as they do not break off for the Prayer, so
they do not break off for the recitation of the Shma. R. Chananiah ben
Aqabia <span id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119) says: Just as they break
off for the recitation of the Shma, so they break off for the Prayer. R.
Eleazar bar Zadoq said that when Rabban Gamaliel and his court of
justice <span id="fr_120"></span>[2](#fn_120) were at Jabneh they were
busy with the needs of the congregation, \[and\] did not break off for
fear of failing in attention to the subject before them.

7\. A porter—although the burden is on his shoulders—behold such a man
recites \[the Shma‘\]. But at the time that he is unloading and loading
he does not recite (it), for his mind is not settled between one and the
other. He should not pray (the Prayer) until the time that he
unloads. <span id="fr_121"></span>[3](#fn_121)

of Esther. Each of these three is composed of more than one section.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[17:4](tbr17.htm#fr_114) *by itself*. For it
