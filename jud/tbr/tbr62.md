#### Against Irreverence for the Temple.

8*a* (5*b*). A man must not behave irreverently when opposite the
eastern gate, <span id="fr_521"></span>[6](#fn_520) for it is set
opposite the Most Holy Sanctuary. He must not enter the Temple area with
his staff, and his

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>shoe(s), <span
id="fr_522"></span>[1](tbr63.htm#fn_521) and with his purse, and with
the dust on his feet. <span id="fr_523"></span>[2](tbr63.htm#fn_522) Nor
should he make it a short cut, <span
id="fr_524"></span>[3](tbr63.htm#fn_523) much less spit there. What of
wearing shoes? For this is out of respect; it is forbidden to enter with
them. And spitting? For this comes from contempt. It is the
regulation. <span id="fr_525"></span>[4](tbr63.htm#fn_524)

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

**T**. VII. 19. A man may not enter the Temple area with money tied up
in his linen cloth, <span id="fr_526"></span>[5](tbr63.htm#fn_525) or
with dust which is on his feet, or with his money-bag tied to him on the
outside \[of his dress\]. For it is said: "*Keep thy feet when thou
goest to the house of God*." <span
id="fr_527"></span>[6](tbr63.htm#fn_526) R. Jose, son of R. Judah, says:
Behold, He says: "*For none might enter within the king's gate clothed
with sackcloth*." <span id="fr_528"></span>[7](tbr63.htm#fn_527) How
many arguments from the less to the greater are there in this case! And
so spitting (is forbidden) by the same argument. For as with a shoe, in
connexion with which there is no customary contempt, the Law says: <span
id="fr_529"></span>[8](tbr63.htm#fn_528) Do not enter in—with a shoe,
how much less with spitting in which there is customary contempt.
