### The Eighteen Prayers and their Abstract.

3\. Rabban Gamaliel used to say: a man prays the Eighteen
\[Benedictions\] every day. R. Joshua used to say the abstract <span
id="fr_192"></span>[6](#fn_191.md) of the Eighteen. R. Joshua <span
id="fr_193"></span>[7](#fn_192.md) used to say: If his Prayer

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

is fluent <span id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_193.md) in his mouth he prays
the Eighteen, *M*. and if not the abstract of the Eighteen. <span
id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_194.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_191"></span>[30:6](tbr28.htm#fr_192.md) *the abstract*. The
word (*mê‘eyn*) is properly "after the appearance of," but is used here
almost as an independent substantive, "a resemblance of," "a
paraphrase," "an abstract" (see Levy, *Neuh. u. Chald. Wörterbuch*,
1883, iii. 640).

The oldest "abstract" of the Eighteen Benedictions seems to be the
*Habinenu* (SA, p. 55 with Abraham's note), where, however, the rubric
orders that the first three prayers of the Eighteen precede it. The
early (Palestinian) form (*c*. 254 A.D.) is given in Dalman *Worte*,
Appendix, p. 304; Staerk, p. 20.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[30:7](tbr28.htm#fr_193.md) *R. Joshua*. B. has R.
Aqiba. But this may be due to the similarity of the sayings ascribed to
the latter in *T*. III. 3. "R. Joshua" in the Mishna is R. Joshua ben
Chananiah, a mishna teacher of the second generation, c. 90-130 A.D. "I
said, I care <span id="page_31">p. 31</span> not if my lot be as that of
Joshua ben Chananja: after the last destruction he earned his bread by
making needles, but in his youth he had been a singer on the steps of
the Temple, and had a memory of what was, before the glory departed"
("George Eliot," *Daniel Deronda*, e. XL., 1876, iii. 179).

<span id="fn_193"></span>[31:1](tbr28.htm#fr_194.md) *fluent*. Cf. M. v. 5.
[p. 41](tbr35.htm#page_41). T. iii. 3. [p. 29](tbr26.htm#page_29.md).

<span id="fn_194"></span>[31:2](tbr28.htm#fr_195.md) *the abstract of the
Eighteen*. If he remember the Eighteen without difficulty, let him pray
them in full.
