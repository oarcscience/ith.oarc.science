#### The Prayer not to be Mechanical: Prayer when in Danger.

4\. R. Eliezer used to say: He that maketh his prayer a fixed
portion <span id="fr_196"></span>[3](#fn_195)—his prayer is not true
supplication. R. Joshua used to say: He that travelleth in a dangerous
place prays the Prayer in a shortened form, the abstract of the
Eighteen, and says: *Save, O LORD, Thy people, the remnant of
Israel;* <span id="fr_197"></span>[4](#fn_196) and at every branch-road
of their journey let their needs be before Thee. Blessed art Thou, O
LORD, that hearest prayer.

**T**. III. 7. If one is walking in a place of danger and of robbers he
prays the Prayer in a shortened form. What is the Prayer in a shortened
form? R. Eliezer says: "Do Thy will in heaven above, and give quietness
of spirit to them that fear Thee in the earth, and do that which is good
in Thine eyes, blessed art Thou that hearest prayer." R. Jose says:
"Hear the voice of the prayer of Thy people Israel, and perform their
request quickly, blessed art Thou that hearest prayer." R. Eleazar bar
Zadoq says: "Hear the voice of the cry of Thy

people Israel, and perform their request quickly, blessed art Thou that
hearest prayer." Others say: "The needs of Thy people are many and their
intelligence is short, let it be acceptable before Thee, O LORD our God,
that Thou shouldest give to each one all his needs, and (to) every
creature sufficient for its wants, blessed art Thou that hearest
prayer." R. Eleazar bar Zadoq said, My father used to pray the Prayer in
a shortened form on sabbath eves: "Of Thy love, O LORD our God, with
which Thou hast loved Israel Thy people, and of Thy compassion, O our
King, with which Thou hast had compassion on the sons of Thy covenant,
Thou hast given to us, O LORD our God, this great and holy seventh day
in love." And over the cup <span id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_197) he used
to say: "Who did sanctify the sabbath day"; and he did not add the
"seal."
