#### The Time of Reciting the Shma‘ in the Morning.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>I. 4 (2). At what time does one
begin to recite the Shma‘ in the mornings? As soon as one can
distinguish between blue and white. <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24)
R. Eliezer says: Between blue and leek-green, <span
id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25) and one may finish it until the sun first
shines out.

R. Joshua <span id="fr_26"></span>[3](#fn_26) says: Until \[the end of\]
the third hour, <span id="fr_27"></span>[4](#fn_27) for such is the
practice of kings’ sons, <span id="fr_28"></span>[5](#fn_28) to arise at
the third hour. He who recites from that time and later has no
loss; <span id="fr_29"></span>[6](#fn_29) he is like a man who reads in
the Law. <span id="fr_30"></span>[7](#fn_30)

**T**. I. 2. At what time does one begin to recite the Shma‘ in the
mornings? Others <span id="fr_31"></span>[8](#fn_31) say: When it is
light enough to recognize one's companion <span
id="fr_32"></span>[9](#fn_32) at the distance of four cubits. Its legal
recitation is at the moment that the sun first shines out, so that a man
may join the *Ge’ullah* <span id="fr_33"></span>[10](#fn_33) to the
*Tephillah*, <span id="fr_34"></span>[11](#fn_34) and thus be praying
the Tephillah in the daytime.

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

R. Judah <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](tbr12.htm#fn_35) said: Once I was
walking behind R. *T*. Aqiba <span
id="fr_36"></span>[2](tbr12.htm#fn_36) and behind R. Eleazar ben
Azariah, <span id="fr_37"></span>[3](tbr12.htm#fn_37) and the time of
reciting the Shma‘ arrived. I supposed that they would neglect reciting
it because they were occupied with the requirements of the congregation.
I recited and said my mishna portion, and, after this, they began, and
the sun was already visible over the tops of the mountains.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_24"></span>[4:1](tbr11.htm#fr_24) *blue and white*. Between
the colours of the threads in the Tsitsith, the "Fringe" of the
Prayer-scarf (Tallith).

<span id="fn_25"></span>[4:2](tbr11.htm#fr_25) *blue and leek-green*.
*i.e.* rather later, because the two colours require a better light to
distinguish them.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[4:3](tbr11.htm#fr_26) *R. Joshua*. R. J. ben
Chananiah, c. 90-130 A.D.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[4:4](tbr11.htm#fr_27) *the third hour*. c. 9
a.m. See note, [p. 28](tbr25.htm#page_28).

<span id="fn_28"></span>[4:5](tbr11.htm#fr_28) *kings’ sons*. *i.e.*
persons who are not obliged to rise early.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[4:6](tbr11.htm#fr_29) *has no loss*. For he may
still recite the Benedictions that precede and follow the Shma‘
(Bartenora).

<span id="fn_30"></span>[4:7](tbr11.htm#fr_30) *in the Law*. And he
receives the same reward (Bartenora).

<span id="fn_31"></span>[4:8](tbr11.htm#fr_31) *Others*. *i.e.* than
those mentioned in *M*. I. 4.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[4:9](tbr11.htm#fr_32) *to recognize one's
companion*. Compare *The Pilgrimage of Etheria*, written in the end of
the fourth century. "The arrival in Jerusalem thus takes place at the
hour when one man begins to be able to recognize another, that is, close
upon but a little before daylight." (English translation, 1919, p. 53;
see also p. 72.)

<span id="fn_33"></span>[4:10](tbr11.htm#fr_33) *the Ge’ullah*. The one
long Benediction that follows the Shma‘ in the morning (Staerk, pp. 6
*sq*.; SA, pp. 42-44,) and the first of the two that follow it in the
evening (Staerk, pp. 8 *sq*.; SA, pp. 98 *sq*.). It is called Ge’ullah
(redemption) because the latter part recalls the redemption from Egypt.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[4:11](tbr11.htm#fr_34) *the Tephillah*. *i.e.*
*the Prayer par excellence*. It consists of <span id="page_5">p.
5</span> nineteen separate prayers, or Benedictions, the original number
being *Eighteen*, whence the name *Shemoneh Esreh*. It is often (though
not in the Mishna or Tosephta of *Berakoth*) called the *Amidah*,
because it was said standing. It is essentially pre-Christian, and
perhaps pre-Maccabean. Both the Palestinian (the earlier) and the
Babylonian (the later and normal) forms are given in Dalman's *Worte*,
Appendix, Staerk, pp. 9 *sqq*., see further SA, pp. lv. *sqq*.
