### II.—PRAYER, ESPECIALLY THE PRAYER *PAR EXCELLENCE* (THE "EIGHTEEN BENEDICTIONS").

#### The Three Times of Prayer.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>IV. 1. THE Morning Prayer \[may be
said\] until midday. R. Judah says \[only\] till the fourth hour. <span
id="fr_173"></span>[2](#fn_172.md) The Afternoon Prayer until the
evening. <span id="fr_174"></span>[3](#fn_173.md) R. Judah says \[only\]
till half the afternoon. <span id="fr_175"></span>[4](#fn_174.md) The
Evening Prayer has no fixed law, and the Additional Prayers <span
id="fr_176"></span>[5](#fn_175.md) may be said the whole day. <span
id="fr_177"></span>[6](#fn_176.md)

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

III\. 1. Just as a fixed law was given <span
id="fr_178"></span>[7](#fn_177.md) for reciting the Shma‘, so did the
Majority set a time for the Prayer. Why did they say: The Morning

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Prayer \[may be
said\] until midday? Because the *T*. morning continual burnt-offering
was offered until midday. <span id="fr_179"></span>[1](#fn_178.md) R. Judah
says: Until the fourth hour. And why did they say: The Afternoon Prayer
until the evening? Because the continual burnt-offering between the
evenings <span id="fr_180"></span>[2](#fn_179.md) was offered until the
evening. R. Judah says: Until the division of the afternoon? The
eleventh hour *minus* a quarter. <span id="fr_181"></span>[3](#fn_180.md)

2\. The evening prayer has no fixed law. R. Eleazar bar Jose <span
id="fr_182"></span>[4](#fn_181.md) says: \[It ends\] with the closing of
the gates. <span id="fr_183"></span>[5](#fn_182.md)

3\. If a man has prayed the additional prayers either while the morning
continual burnt-sacrifice is offered, or up to a time when the morning
continual burnt-sacrifice is no longer offered—he has accomplished his
duty. R. Aqiba says, if his prayer flows freely in his mouth, it is a
good sign for him, but if not, it is a bad sign for him. He used to
say: <span id="fr_184"></span>[6](#fn_183.md) Everyone in whom the mind of
man finds pleasure, the mind of God <span
id="fr_185"></span>[7](#fn_184.md) finds pleasure \[also\]; if the mind of
man does not find pleasure in him the mind of God 7 does not find
pleasure in him.

Everyone whose own mind finds pleasure in what he does <span
id="fr_186"></span>[8](#fn_185.md)—it is a good sign for him; if his own
mind does not find pleasure in what he does it is a bad sign for him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_172"></span>[28:2](tbr26.htm#fr_173.md) *the fourth hour*.
Until the end of it, which is the third part of the day (Bartenora), say
so a.m.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[28:3](tbr26.htm#fr_174.md) *the evening*. i.e.
sunset, say 6 p.m.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[28:4](tbr26.htm#fr_175.md) *half the afternoon*.
The afternoon (*Minchah*) lasts from the ninth hour and a half, say 3.30
p.m., for two and a half hours, so that the half of this would be about
4.45 p.m. (cf. Bartenora).

<span id="fn_175"></span>[28:5](tbr26.htm#fr_176.md) *the Additional
Prayers*. Special prayers for Sabbaths and Feast days (SA, pp. 559-573,
233-238). Special sacrifices are ordered in Num. 28<sup>29</sup>.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[28:6](tbr26.htm#fr_177.md) *the whole day*. B
adds, "R. Judah says \[the Additional Prayers may be said\] until the
seventh hour," say 1 p.m.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[28:7](tbr26.htm#fr_178.md) The Vienna MS. and the
common text read, "Just as the Law appointed a fixed law," and this may
be right.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[29:1](tbr26.htm#fr_179.md) *was offered until
midday.* "The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning" (*ba bôqer*),
clearly not later than midday (Ex. 29<sup>39</sup>)

<span id="fn_179"></span>[29:2](tbr26.htm#fr_180.md) *between the
evenings*. Exod. 29<sup>39</sup>, R. V. margin.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[29:3](tbr26.htm#fr_181.md) *the eleventh hour*
minus *a quarter*. 4.45 p.m. see mishna, note.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[29:4](tbr26.htm#fr_182.md) *Eleazar bar Jose*.
Eleazar, son of Jose the Galilean ([p. 55](tbr40.htm#page_55).md), a mishna
teacher of the third generation, c. 130-160 A.D.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[29:5](tbr26.htm#fr_183.md) *the closing of the
gates*. Presumably the Temple gates were closed at dusk.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[29:6](tbr26.htm#fr_184.md) See *Aboth* III. 53
(15), where however the saying is attributed to R. Hananiah ben Dosa.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[29:7](tbr26.htm#fr_185.md) *God*. Lit.: the
Place, in Whom are all things, "for He is the Place of the world, and
the world is not His place." See C. Taylor on Aboth. II. 18 (17); Lukyn
Williams on Col. 1<sup>17</sup>.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[29:8](tbr26.htm#fr_186.md) *what he does*. Lit.:
"what is his," but the reference seems to be not to his possessions, but
to his occupations and actions.
