#### At Various Natural Phenomena, and at Good or Bad Tidings.

*M*. IX. 2. At <span id="fr_455"></span>[1](#fn_454) shooting
stars, <span id="fr_456"></span>[2](#fn_455) and at earthquakes, and at
lightnings, and at thunder, and at wind(s), one says: "Blessed be He
whose power filleth the world." At mountains and hills, at seas and
rivers and at deserts, he says: "Blessed be the Maker of the works of
creation." R. Judah says: He who sees the Great Sea <span
id="fr_457"></span>[3](#fn_456) says: "Blessed be He who made the Great
Sea." \[This he says\] when he sees it at intervals. <span
id="fr_458"></span>[4](#fn_457) At rains, and at good tidings, he says:
"Blessed be the Good and the Doer of good," and at ill reports he says
"Blessed be He who judgeth in truth."

**T**. VII. 1. The Benediction in the invitation <span
id="fr_459"></span>[5](#fn_458) is derived from the Law, for it is said:
"*And thou shalt eat and be full, and thou shalt bless*" <span
id="fr_460"></span>[6](#fn_459)—this is the Benediction in the
invitation; "*the LORD thy God*"—this is the first Benediction; "*for
the. . . land*"—this is the Benediction for the land; "*good*" this is
\[the Benediction for\] Jerusalem; and so it says: "*this goodly
mountain, and Lebanon*." <span id="fr_461"></span>[7](#fn_460) "*Which
he hath given thee*," <span id="fr_462"></span>[8](#fn_461)—this is
\[the Benediction\] "who art Good and doest good." Whence do we learn
that just as thou blessest Him after it (*i.e.* the meal), so thou
blessest Him before it? It is expressly said: "*which he gave thee*,"
*i.e.* from the

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

time that He is giving it thee and whence \[do we learn that we bless
Him\] even for the mountains and for the hills? <span
id="fr_463"></span>[1](#fn_462) It is expressly said: "*for the land*."
Whence even for the Law and even for the commandments? It is expressly
said: "*Who gave thee*," and in another place he says: "*And I will give
thee the tables of stone*." <span id="fr_464"></span>[2](#fn_463) R.
Meir says: Whence \[do we learn that\] just as thou sayest a Benediction
over what is good, so thou sayest a Benediction over what is evil. It is
expressly said: "*Which the LORD thy God gave thee*," <span
id="fr_465"></span>[3](#fn_464)—"thy God" means "thy Judge," in every
judgment which He adjudges thee, whether for good or for punishment.

3\. He who sees a negro, or a man with red spots, or one with white
spots, or a humpback, or a dwarf, says: "Blessed be He who makes
creatures different." \[He who sees\] one who has lost a limb, or a lame
man, or a blind man, or one afflicted with boils, says: "Blessed be He
that judgeth in truth."

4\. If one sees beautiful persons and beautiful trees he says: "Blessed
be He who has beautiful creatures thus in His world." <span
id="fr_466"></span>[4](#fn_465)

5\. He who sees the bow in the cloud says: "Blessed be He who is
faithful in His. covenant, remembering the covenant." <span
id="fr_467"></span>[5](#fn_466)

6\. If one walks in a burial-ground one says: "Blessed be He who knows
the number of you all; He will judge you; He will raise you up; Blessed
be He who is faithful in His word, restoring the dead to life."

He who sees the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the planets, says:
"Blessed be He who maketh the things of Creation." R. Judah says:

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

He who says a Benediction over the sun—lo, this is another way. <span
id="fr_468"></span>[1](#fn_467) And so R. Judah used to say: "He who
seeth the sea continually, and any change takes place in it, must say a
Benediction." <span id="fr_469"></span>[2](#fn_468)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_454"></span>[76:1](tbr57.htm#fr_455) SA, pp. 291 *sq*., has
similar, but not quite identical, forms. Cf. Abrahams’ notes.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[76:2](tbr57.htm#fr_456) *shooting stars*, or,
"comets."

<span id="fn_456"></span>[76:3](tbr57.htm#fr_457) *the Great Sea*. The
Mediterranean.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[76:4](tbr57.htm#fr_458) *at intervals*. Cf.
*T*. VII. 6 (p. 78). At intervals of thirty days (Bartenora), thus
excluding persons who live on the coast.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[76:5](tbr57.htm#fr_459) *The Benediction in
the invitation*. See [p. 59](tbr41.htm#page_59).

<span id="fn_459"></span>[76:6](tbr57.htm#fr_460) Deut. 8<sup>10</sup>.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[76:7](tbr57.htm#fr_461) Deut. 3<sup>25</sup>.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[76:8](tbr57.htm#fr_462) Deut. 810.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[77:1](tbr57.htm#fr_463) *for the mountains and
for the hills*. *i.e.* on seeing them.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[77:2](tbr57.htm#fr_464) Exod. 24<sup>12</sup>.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[77:3](tbr57.htm#fr_465) *the LORD thy God gave
thee*. This is the sense of Deut. 8<sup>10</sup>, but verbally the
quotation is found in 26<sup>11</sup>, where it refers to "good," and
also in 28<sup>53</sup>, where it refers to punishment.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[77:4](tbr57.htm#fr_466) The common text has,
"who created beautiful creatures."

<span id="fn_466"></span>[77:5](tbr57.htm#fr_467) *remembering the
covenant*. His faithfulness is seen in His remembering it. The reference
is to Gen. 9<sup>15</sup>.

<span id="fn_467"></span>[78:1](tbr57.htm#fr_468) *another way*. For
this common use of "way" in the sense of manner of life ordered by
religion, and so religion itself, *cf*. Acts 9<sup>2</sup>,
19<sup>9-23</sup>, 2<sup>24</sup>, 24<sup>22</sup>, and the
all—comprehensive John 14<sup>6</sup>. Even the word Halaka is properly,
we may suppose, "method of walk."

<span id="fn_468"></span>[78:2](tbr57.htm#fr_469) Cf. [p. 76](#page_76).
