#### Various Regulations respecting Benedictions at Meals.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>6. If men are already seated <span
id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_300.md) each says the Benediction for himself.
If they have reclined \[on their couches to eat\] one says it for them
all. <span id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_301.md) If wine comes to them in the
midst of the meal each one says the Benediction for himself. <span
id="fr_303"></span>[3](#fn_302.md) If after the meal one says it for them
all. And he says it over the spices put on the coals, <span
id="fr_304"></span>[4](#fn_303.md) even though the spices are not brought
in until only after the feast. <span id="fr_305"></span>[5](#fn_304.md)

**T**. IV. 8. In what manner is the order of the feast? The guests enter
and sit on benches \[and\] on chairs until they have all entered. When
they have all entered and are given water <span
id="fr_306"></span>[6](#fn_305.md) for their hands, each one washes one
hand. When they have mixed them the cup each one says the Benediction
for himself. When the *hors d’œuvres* have been brought each one says
the Benediction for himself.

If they have gone upstairs <span id="fr_307"></span>[7](#fn_306.md) and
reclined, and are

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

given water for their hands, although he washes one hand \[before\], he
\[now\] washes both his hands. When the cup is mixed for them, although
he has said the Benediction over the first he says one \[again\] over
the second. When the *hors d’œuvres* have been brought, although he has
said the Benediction over the first he says one \[again\] over the
second, and one person says it for them all. He that comes after three
*hors d’œuvres* is not allowed to enter.

9\. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: This was a great custom in
Jerusalem; a towel was spread on the top of the doorway; all the time
that the towel was spread guests could enter; when the towel was removed
guests were not allowed to enter.

10\. And further there was another custom in Jerusalem. They used to
entrust the meal to a cook. If anything in the meal was faulty they used
to fine the cook. Everything had to be for the honour of the host, and
everything for the honour of the guests.

11\. The rule in a feast is that if one goes out to relieve nature, he
washes one hand; if to speak with his companion and he breaks off \[from
the meal\], he washes both hands, <span id="fr_308"></span>[1](#fn_307.md)
Where does he go to wash? He comes and reclines in his place, and
washes, and dries his hands, <span id="fr_309"></span>[2](#fn_308.md) and
returns the napkin to the guests.

12\. Ben Zoma was asked: Why when wine comes in the middle of food does
each one say the Benediction for himself? He said to them: because the
gullet is not empty. <span id="fr_310"></span>[3](#fn_309.md)

13\. If rice is brought them and wine, one says a

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Benediction over
the rice and lets the wine go free; <span
id="fr_311"></span>[1](#fn_310.md) if radishes and unripe dates, one says a
Benediction over the radishes and lets the unripe dates go free. <span
id="fr_312"></span>[2](#fn_311.md)

V. 5. What is the order of reclining? When there are two couches, the
eldest <span id="fr_313"></span>[3](#fn_312.md) reclines at the head of the
first, and the second to him, below him; <span
id="fr_314"></span>[4](#fn_313.md) and when there are three couches the
eldest reclines at the head of the middle one, the second to him above
him, the third to him below him. So they go on arranging them.

6\. The order of washing hands—how is it \[arranged\]? Up to the number
of five \[persons\] they begin with the eldest; from five and onwards
they begin with the youngest.

The order of mixing the cup—how is it \[arranged\]? In the middle of the
meal they begin with the eldest; and after the meal they begin with him
who says the Benediction. If \[the latter\] wishes to assign the honour
to his teacher, or to one who is older than himself, he is permitted to
do so.

7\. Two wait each for the other at a dish; <span
id="fr_315"></span>[5](#fn_314.md) but three do not wait. <span
id="fr_316"></span>[6](#fn_315.md) He who says the Benediction stretches
his hand out first \[to take the food\]. If he wishes to assign the
honour to his teacher, or to one who is older than himself, he is
[permitted](errata.htm#2.md) to do so.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

8\. A man may not take a bite of a piece and then return it to the dish,
for fear of infection.

9\. A man may not drink of a cup and give it to his companion, because
men's taste differs. <span id="fr_317"></span>[1](#fn_316.md)

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VI. 7. If salted relish <span
id="fr_318"></span>[2](#fn_317.md) is brought before him at first, and a
piece of bread with it, he says the Benediction over the salted relish,
and lets the piece of bread go free, for the piece of bread is an
accompaniment to it. This is the general rule: In the case of everything
which is the principal food, with other food accompanying it, one says
the Benediction over the principal food, and lets the accompaniment go
free.

**T**. IV. 14. In the case of salted fish, and a piece of bread—one says
a Benediction over the salted fish and lets the piece go free. R.
Chananiah ben Gamaliel says: In the case of a bit of bread that comes
first, before the meal, and a bit of bread that comes with the salted
fish after the meal, a Benediction is required before it and after it.

Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: Pieces of bread are a great sign to
guests. So long as the guests see the pieces they know that something
more is coming after them; <span id="fr_319"></span>[3](#fn_318.md) when
\[they see\] a whole loaf and beans they know that nothing else comes
after them.

15\. We say <span id="fr_320"></span>[4](#fn_319.md) the Benediction over
that corn which is of the choicest. How so? In the case of a whole loaf
of Lesbian flour <span id="fr_321"></span>[5](#fn_320.md) and a whole loaf
of

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

home-grown? One says the Benediction over the whole loaf of Lesbian. In
the case of a piece of Lesbian and a whole loaf of home-grown? One says
the Benediction over the whole loaf of homegrown. If there is wheaten
bread and barley bread? One says the Benediction over the wheaten. If
there is a piece of wheaten and a whole loaf of barley? One says the
Benediction over the piece of wheaten. If barley bread and spelt bread?
One says the Benediction over the barley bread. But is not spelt
superior to barley? Yes, but barley is one of the seven kinds, and spelt
is not. This is the general principle: In the case of everything that is
one of the seven kinds or a kind of corn. Rabban Gamaliel says: One says
three Benedictions after it; and the Majority say, One Benediction.

Now there is an incident in \[the life of\] Rabban Gamaliel and some
Elders, who were reclining at a meal in Jericho. Dried dates <span
id="fr_322"></span>[1](#fn_321.md) were brought before them. R. Aqiba made
haste and said one Benediction after it. Rabban Gamaliel said to him:
Aqiba, why dost thou put thy head between contending parties? <span
id="fr_323"></span>[2](#fn_322.md) He said to him: Rabbi, thou hast taught
us to incline after the greater number; although thou sayest so, yet the
Rule is according to the words of those who are more numerous. <span
id="fr_324"></span>[3](#fn_323.md)

R. Judah says in the name of Rabban Gamaliel: In the case of everything
which is one of the seven

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

kinds and is not a kind of corn, and in the case of corn which is not
made into bread, Rabban Gamaliel says a man says three Benedictions
after it, and the Majority say: One Benediction. In the case of anything
which is not one of the seven kinds, and is not a kind of corn, Rabban
Gamaliel says: One Benediction, and the Majority say: A man does not say
any Benediction at all.

16\. There is an incident in the life of R. Tarphon, who was sitting in
the shadow of a dovecot on a sabbath in the afternoon. A bucket of cold
water was brought before him. R. Tarphon said to his disciples: In what
manner shall he who drinketh water to satisfy his thirst say the
Benediction? His disciples said to him: "Teach us, O our Rabbi." He said
to them: "Thou that createst souls and that which they need." He said to
them: "Shall I discuss this?" They said to him: "Teach us." He said to
them: Behold He said: "*and they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted
up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a travelling company of
Ishmaelites*," <span id="fr_325"></span>[1](#fn_324.md) etc. But is it not
the custom of Arabs to he carrying nothing but skins of evil odour and
resin? But \[we read\] that they set that righteous man <span
id="fr_326"></span>[2](#fn_325.md) among their precious things. <span
id="fr_327"></span>[3](#fn_326.md) Now behold these words yield the
argument of the less to the greater: If this happened at a time when the
righteous were under \[God's\] anger, and mercy was shown them, how much
more in the time of His mercy!

17\. Like that \[are the words\] "*So they drew near, and carried them
in their coats*," <span id="fr_328"></span>[4](#fn_327.md) etc. And do not
these words yield an argument of the less to the

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

greater? If at the time of God's wrath against the righteous mercy is
shown to them, how much more at the time that He has mercy upon them!
Like that expression thou findest it said: <span
id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_328.md) "The lion had not eaten the carcase, nor
torn the ass."  <span id="fr_330"></span>[2](#fn_329.md) And, behold, the
words yield an argument of the less to the greater. If at the time of
God's wrath against the righteous mercy is shown to them, how much more
at the time that He has mercy upon them! He said to them: Shall I
discuss it? They said: Teach us, O our Master. He said to them: Why did
Judah deserve the kingdom? They said to him:  <span
id="fr_331"></span>[3](#fn_330.md) Because he made confession  <span
id="fr_332"></span>[4](#fn_331.md) about Tamar.

18\. There is an incident of four elders who were sitting in the portico
of R. Joshua. These were they: Eleazar ben Mattai, Chananiah ben
Chakinai, and Simeon ben Azzai, and Simeon the Temanite. <span
id="fr_333"></span>[5](#fn_332.md) They were occupied with what R. Aqiba
had taught them: Why did Judah deserve the kingdom? Because he made
confession about Tamar. They added further of themselves: "*Which wise
men tell from their fathers, and have not hid it; unto whom alone the
land was given, and no stranger passed among them*." <span
id="fr_334"></span>[6](#fn_333) He <span id="fr_335"></span>[7](#fn_334.md)
said to them: What! Is a reward given for transgression? <span
id="fr_336"></span>[8](#fn_335.md) But <span
id="fr_337"></span>[9](#fn_336.md) why did Judah deserve the kingdom?
Because he delivered his brother from death, for it is said: "*And
Judah* 

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

*said unto his brothers, What profit*," etc.? "*Come, and let us sell
him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him*." <span
id="fr_338"></span>[1](#fn_337) He <span id="fr_339"></span>[2](#fn_338.md)
said to them: It is sufficient unto the deliverance that it should atone
for the sale. <span id="fr_340"></span>[3](#fn_339.md)

But why did Judah deserve the kingdom? Because of his humility. For it
is said: "*Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of
the lad*," <span id="fr_341"></span>[4](#fn_340.md) etc. Even Saul deserved
the kingdom only because of his humility, for it is said: "*Lest my
father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us*," <span
id="fr_342"></span>[5](#fn_341.md) etc. He accounted his servant like
himself. But Samuel did not so, but \[said\]: "*Lo, thy father hath left
the care of the asses, and taketh thought for you, saying, What shall I
do for my son?*" <span id="fr_343"></span>[6](#fn_342.md) And when he was
fleeing from the princedom, what does it say? "*Therefore they asked of
the LORD further, Is there yet a man to come hither? And He
said*," <span id="fr_344"></span>[7](#fn_343.md) etc. He <span
id="fr_345"></span>[8](#fn_344.md) said to them: But was he \[Judah\] not a
surety, and the end of being surety is to become free from
suretyship. <span id="fr_346"></span>[9](#fn_345.md) But why did Judah
deserve the kingdom? Because he sanctified the name of God \[lit.: the
Place\] at the Sea, for when the tribes came and stood on \[the edge
of\] the sea, this one said: I am going down first, and this said: I am
going down first; the tribe of Judah made haste and went down first, and
sanctified the name of God at the sea. And concerning that time does it
say: "*Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul. I sink
in deep mire*," <span id="fr_347"></span>[10](#fn_346.md) etc., and so it
says: "*When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the* 

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

*house of Jacob from a people of strange language; Judah became his
sanctuary, Israel his dominion*." <span id="fr_348"></span>[1](#fn_347.md)
Judah, because he sanctified the name of God at the Sea: therefore
Israel became his, *i.e.* Judah's, dominion.

19\. If \[during the meal\] they have moved to conduct a bride
home, <span id="fr_349"></span>[2](#fn_348.md) and have left there \[at the
meal\] even one old man, or even a sick man, it is not necessary for
them to say a Benediction in irregular order; <span
id="fr_350"></span>[3](#fn_349.md) and, when they return, it is not
necessary for them to say it as at the beginning. If they have not left
anyone there, even an old man, or a sick man, it is necessary for them
to say a Benediction in irregular order, and when they return it is
necessary to say it as at the beginning.

20\. In the case of the master of the house who is reclining and
eating, <span id="fr_351"></span>[4](#fn_350.md) and his partner calls him
to speak with him, it is not necessary to say a Benediction in irregular
order, and when he returns it is not necessary to say it as at the
beginning. If he withdraws \[voluntarily and for some time\] it is
necessary to say a Benediction in irregular order, and when he returns
it is necessary to say it as at the beginning.

21\. In the case of workmen who are picking figs, or cutting dates, or
plucking olives, although they repeatedly break off and eat (some of
what they pick), it is not necessary for them to say the Benediction in
irregular order, and when they return it is not necessary for them to
say the

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Benediction as at
the beginning. If they withdraw it is necessary to say the Benediction
in irregular order, and when they return it is necessary for them to say
the Benediction as at the beginning.

VI\. 8. If one has eaten figs, and grapes, and pomegranates, he says
three Benedictions <span id="fr_352"></span>[1](tbr41.htm#fn_351.md) over
them. <span id="fr_353"></span>[2](tbr41.htm#fn_352.md) This is the opinion
of Rabban Gamaliel. But the Majority say: One Benediction \[which is\]
the summary of three. R. Aqiba says: even if he eats vegetable *potage*
as his meal, he says three Benedictions over it. And he who drinks water
to satisfy his thirst says \[the Benediction\], "For all came into
existence by His word." <span id="fr_354"></span>[3](tbr41.htm#fn_353.md)
R. Tarphon says: \[He says\], "Thou that createst souls and their
needs." <span id="fr_355"></span>[4](tbr41.htm#fn_354.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_300"></span>[48:1](tbr40.htm#fr_301.md) *already seated*.
*i.e.* without any previous intention of having a meal together. They
were seated, as it were, by chance, not in the regular order of
reclinings at a feast together.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[48:2](tbr40.htm#fr_302.md) For they are plainly
of one company.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[48:3](tbr40.htm#fr_303.md) *for himself*. The
mouths of the others may not be empty, and they cannot say Amen with
safety. Also they may not be paying attention. The answer is attributed
to Ben Zoma in *T*. IV. 12.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[48:4](tbr40.htm#fr_304.md) *spices put on the
coals*. To sweeten the room after the meal, or in honour of the guests
(Krauss, i, 238, 690; iii. 63). Cf. *infra*, [p. 68](tbr50.htm#page_68.md).

<span id="fn_304"></span>[48:5](tbr40.htm#fr_305.md) *after the feast*.
When the closing Benediction will have been already said.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[48:6](tbr40.htm#fr_306.md) *are given water*.
Zuckermandel's text (Erfurt MS.), not the Vienna MS. or the ordinary
text, has two terms for this (*wnāthalu* *wnāthnu*).

<span id="fn_306"></span>[48:7](tbr40.htm#fr_307.md) If they have gone
upstairs, *i.e.* into the special dining-room. Cf. the "upper room"
(ἀνάγαιον) of the Last Supper (Mark 14<sup>15</sup>, parallel Luke
22<sup>12</sup>).

<span id="fn_307"></span>[49:1](tbr40.htm#fr_308.md) *both hands*. Long
absence makes it almost like beginning the meal afresh.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[49:2](tbr40.htm#fr_309.md) *dries his hands*.
This is what we expect, but both Zuckermandel's and the common text (the
latter in brackets) read *whi.tpiach*, which usually means "and makes
his hands wet." But it may perhaps mean, "and claps his hands," *i.e.*
to dry them.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[49:3](tbr40.htm#fr_310.md) Cf. *M*. VI. 6 ([p.
48](#page_48).md).

<span id="fn_310"></span>[50:1](tbr40.htm#fr_311.md) *lets the wine go
free*. It is treated as sauce for the rice.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[50:2](tbr40.htm#fr_312.md) *lets the unripe dates
go free*. Similarly they are treated as condiments to the radishes.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[50:3](tbr40.htm#fr_313.md) *the eldest*. The
position at meals is determined by age, but in the lecture hall, or the
tribunal, by learning. See Krauss, iii. 45, where there is also a
picture of an early model of a meal, reproduced from Benzinger.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[50:4](tbr40.htm#fr_314.md) *below him*. Persons
reclined on their left side that their right hands might be free.
"Below" therefore means on the right, "above" on the left. In John
13<sup>23</sup>, <sup>25</sup>, St. John himself was on the right of our
Lord, and perhaps St. Peter on our Lord's left.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[50:5](tbr40.htm#fr_315.md) *Two wait*. Presumably
because being less than three they cannot form a religious company (vide
infra, pp. [59](tbr41.htm#page_59), [62](tbr43.htm#page_62.md),
[63](tbr44.htm#page_63).md) and each is equal to the other.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[50:6](tbr40.htm#fr_316.md) *three do not wait*.
They do form a company and have a leader, who helps himself first.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[51:1](tbr40.htm#fr_317.md) *men's taste differs*.
So Krauss, iii. 53, 264.

<span id="fn_317"></span>[51:2](tbr40.htm#fr_318.md) *salted relish*. After
eating much sweet fruit—"fruits of Gennesareth," *T*. B.
44<sup>a</sup>—to prevent weakness of the stomach.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[51:3](tbr40.htm#fr_319.md) *after them*. For the
pieces of bread served as spoons.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[51:4](tbr40.htm#fr_320.md) *We sa*y. When bread
of different kinds is set before us.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[51:5](tbr40.htm#fr_321.md) *a whole loaf of
Lesbian flour* (*shlêma shel glusqin*). In view of the succeeding
phrases *glusqin* is the material, and represents fine flour of some
special brand. Jastrow (p. 246<sup>b</sup>) says it equals <span
id="page_52">p. 52</span> "Lesbian," with a guttural before it. But in
form the connexion with κόλλιξ, κολλίκιον, a thick roll, is more
probable. In the latter case the classical implication that, κόλλιξ was
a roll made of coarse grain does not apply to the term when hebraized.
See Krauss, i. 105, 472.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[52:1](tbr40.htm#fr_322.md) *Dried dates*.
(*Kôthbôth*.) See Krauss, ii. 246.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[52:2](tbr40.htm#fr_323.md) *thy head between
contending parties:* i.e. why deviate from the established rule?

<span id="fn_323"></span>[52:3](tbr40.htm#fr_324.md) Aqiba argues that
although Gamaliel and his companions asserted that three Benedictions
ought to have been said, yet this was not the opinion of the real
majority of scholars.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[53:1](tbr40.htm#fr_325.md) Gen. 37<sup>25</sup>.
The passage continues, "came from Gilead, with their camels bearing
spicery, and balm, and myrrh."

<span id="fn_325"></span>[53:2](tbr40.htm#fr_326.md) *that righteous man*.
Cf. Wisd. 10<sup>5</sup> *sq*.; and perhaps 2 Pet. 2<sup>8</sup>.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[53:3](tbr40.htm#fr_327.md) R. Tarphon's words end
here (see Bacher, *Ag. Tann*. I. 354 n. 3). He is explaining how God
gives persons what they need.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[53:4](tbr40.htm#fr_328.md) Lev. 10<sup>5</sup>
The Erfurt MS. has, "and they brought them near," *wayqārbūm*, but this
can hardly be right.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[54:1](tbr40.htm#fr_329.md) *thou findest it
said*. Literally, "thou sayest." But it is a technical expression used
of a further deduction from a fresh passage. See Bacher, *Terminologie*,
I. 76.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[54:2](tbr40.htm#fr_330.md) 1 Kings
13<sup>28</sup>.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[54:3](tbr40.htm#fr_331.md) *They said to him*.
Bacher, *Ag. Tann.* I. 354, n. 5, would omit these words, because
Tarphon naturally gives the answer.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[54:4](tbr40.htm#fr_332.md) *he made confession*.
(*Hodah*.) The same root as Judah.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[54:5](tbr40.htm#fr_333.md) On these four
contemporaries (c. 100-130 A.D.) see Bacher, *Ag. Tann*. I. pp. 352-354.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[54:6](tbr40.htm#fr_334.md) Job 15<sup>18
*sq*</sup>.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[54:7](tbr40.htm#fr_335.md) *He*. Namely R. Aqiba,
or perhaps R. Tarphon, § 16.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[54:8](tbr40.htm#fr_336.md) *for transgression*.
In spite of the quotation from Job, Judah's confession of sin might
deserve pardon for his sin, but not a reward.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[54:9](tbr40.htm#fr_337.md) *But*. Introducing a
