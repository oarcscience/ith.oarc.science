### III.—BENEDICTIONS AT, AND ESPECIALLY AFTER, MEALS, AND ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS.

#### The Proper Forms for the Different Foods.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VI. 1. What is the form of the
Benediction over fruits? <span id="fr_275"></span>[4](#fn_274.md) Over the
fruits of trees a man says: "Thou that createst the fruit of the tree";
with the exception of wine, for over wine he says: "Thou that createst
the fruit of the vine." Over the fruits of the earth he says: "Thou that
createst the fruit of the ground"; with the exception of a piece of
bread, for over a piece of bread he says: "Thou that bringest forth
bread from the earth." Over vegetables he says: "Thou

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>that createst the fruit of the
ground." R. Judah used to say: "Thou that createst different kinds of
herbs."

2\. If a man has said over the fruits of trees the Benediction: "Thou
that createst the fruit of the ground" <span
id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_275.md) he has fulfilled his obligation. Over
the fruits of the earth, "Thou that createst the fruit of the tree"—he
has not fulfilled it. <span id="fr_277"></span>[2](#fn_276.md) And if he
has said over them all, "By whose word all things exist," he has
fulfilled it. <span id="fr_278"></span>[3](#fn_277.md)

3\. Over anything that has not grown out of the earth \[*e.g.* animal
food\], he says, "By whose word all things exist." Over vinegar, and
over locusts, <span id="fr_279"></span>[4](#fn_278.md) and over \[fallen\]
unripe fruits, he says: "By whose word all things exist." <span
id="fr_280"></span>[5](#fn_279.md) R. Judah says: Anything which belongs to
a kind that has to do with a curse <span id="fr_281"></span>[6](#fn_280.md)
must not have a Benediction said over it.

4\. If a man has in front of him many kinds \[of fruit\], R. Judah says:
If among them there is one of the seven kinds he says the Benediction
over it. <span id="fr_282"></span>[7](#fn_281.md)

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span> But the Majority say: He says the Benediction over
whichever of them he likes.

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

T. IV. 1. Let not a man taste anything until he pronounces a
Benediction, for it is said: "*The LORD'S is the earth, and the fulness
thereof; the world and they that dwell in it*." <span
id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_282.md) He that getteth enjoyment out of this
world without a Benediction, behold, he has defrauded (the LORD), <span
id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_283.md) to such a degree that at last all the
commands are loosed for him. <span id="fr_285"></span>[3](#fn_284.md) Let
not a man make use of his face, his hands, and his feet, save for the
honour of his Owner, for it is said: "*The LORD hath made everything for
His own purpose*." <span id="fr_286"></span>[4](#fn_285.md)

2\. In the case of date-honey, cider, and vinegar made from late grapes,
we say Benedictions over them in the same way that we say Benedictions
over brine (pickle). <span id="fr_287"></span>[5](#fn_286.md)

3\. In the case of unmixed wine, they say over it the Benediction: "Thou
that createst the fruit of the tree," <span
id="fr_288"></span>[6](#fn_287.md) and take of it for washing the hands. If
one has put water into it they say over it the Benediction: "Thou that
createst the fruit of the vine," and they do not take of it for washing
the hands. These are the words of R. Eliezer. But the Majority say:
unmixed or mixed are all one. <span id="fr_289"></span>[7](#fn_288.md) They
say over it the Benediction: "Thou that createst the fruit of the vine,"
and do not take of it for washing the hands.

4\. If they have brought before him different

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

kinds of dessert he says the Benediction over them: "Thou that createst
different kinds of sweetmeats." <span id="fr_290"></span>[1](#fn_289.md)
Over the seeds <span id="fr_291"></span>[2](#fn_290.md) he says: "Thou that
createst different kinds of seeds." And over the herbs he says: "Thou
that createst different kinds of herbs." And over the vegetables he
says: "Thou that createst the fruit of the ground." R. Judah says:
"Blessed is He that causeth the earth to produce by His word." R. Meir
says: Even if he has seen the piece of bread and says: "Blessed be He
who created this piece of bread; how beautiful is it!"—this is its
Benediction. <span id="fr_292"></span>[3](#fn_291.md)

5\. If he has seen figs, and has said: "Blessed be He who has created
these figs; how beautiful they are"—this is their Benediction. R. Jose
says: Everyone who changes the formula which the Majority formed in a
Benediction has not fulfilled his obligation. R. Judah says, If anything
is changed from its natural condition, and one then makes a change in
the Benediction of it, he has fulfilled his obligation. <span
id="fr_293"></span>[4](#fn_292.md)

6\. He that cheweth \[grains of\] wheat says the Benediction over them,
"that createst different kinds of seeds." If he has baked them or boiled
them, at the time when the grains remain \[distinct\], he says the
Benediction over them: "Who bringest bread out from the earth," <span
id="fr_294"></span>[5](#fn_293) and (after the meal.md) he says three
Benedictions over them. <span id="fr_295"></span>[6](#fn_294.md) If the
grains do not remain \[distinct\] he says the Benediction over them:
"who createst different

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

kinds of foods," and he says One Benediction after them. <span
id="fr_296"></span>[1](tbr39.htm#fn_295.md)

7\. He that cheweth rice <span id="fr_297"></span>[2](tbr39.htm#fn_296.md)
says the Benediction over it: "who createst different kinds of seeds."
If he has baked it, or boiled it, so long as the grains remain
\[distinct\], he says the Benediction over them: "who createst different
kinds of foods," and does not say any Benediction after it at all. This
is the general principle, that in the case of everything which begins
with (the Benediction) "who bringest out bread," one says three
Benedictions after it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_271"></span>[43:1](tbr37.htm#fr_272.md) *the Pharisees*. The
word does not occur in either of the two forms of the *Shemoneh Esreh*,
though in the best text of the Babylonian "the pious" (*hachasidim*) are
mentioned in No. 13 (SA, p. 48).

<span id="fn_272"></span>[43:2](tbr37.htm#fr_273.md) *the Proselytes . . .
the Elders*. See the common text of No. 13.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[43:3](tbr37.htm#fr_274.md) *David . . .
Jerusalem*. So the Palestinian and the common text of No. 14 (SA, p.
49). But David is not mentioned in the best text of the Babylonian form.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[43:4](tbr38.htm#fr_275.md) On Grace at meals,
both before and after, see SA, pp. 278-286. The Grace before meals was
very short (SA, p. 278), that after was elaborate and the rules
following refer to variations in it.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[44:1](tbr38.htm#fr_276.md) *The ground*. Instead
of "the tree" SA, p. 290.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[44:2](tbr38.htm#fr_277.md) *he has not fulfilled
it*. A tree fairly comes under things that grow from the ground, and the
Benediction may therefore pass. But a vegetable is not a tree, and to
call it so in a Benediction spoils the Benediction.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[44:3](tbr38.htm#fr_278.md) SA, p. 290. For this
gives glory to Him to whom it is due. The phrase "by whose word" may
underlie John 1<sup>3</sup>.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[44:4](tbr38.htm#fr_279.md) *locusts*. Matt
3<sup>4</sup>.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[44:5](tbr38.htm#fr_280.md) *exist*. Some MSS.
(not B.) add, "over milk and over cheese and over eggs, 'by whose
word,'" etc.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[44:6](tbr38.htm#fr_281.md) *a curse*. Because of
corruption as in the case of vinegar (from wine), fallen fruit, cheese,
or by being symbols of destruction as in the case of locusts (Joel
2<sup>1-11</sup>).

<span id="fn_281"></span>[44:7](tbr38.htm#fr_282.md) *i.e.* the Benediction
that corresponds to whichever of the seven kinds (see [p.
57](tbr40.htm#page_57).md) he chooses.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[45:1](tbr38.htm#fr_283.md) Ps. 24<sup>1</sup>.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[45:2](tbr38.htm#fr_284.md) *defrauded* (*the
LORD*). The verb *ma‘al* suggests Lev. 5<sup>15</sup>.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[45:3](tbr38.htm#fr_285.md) *loosed for him*. One
duty neglected leads to total disregard of the Law. Cf. Jas.
2<sup>10</sup>. For "loosed" *cf*. Matt. 5<sup>19</sup>.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[45:4](tbr38.htm#fr_286.md) Prov. 16<sup>4</sup>.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[45:5](tbr38.htm#fr_287) *brine* (*pickle*.md).
The Latin word *muries* is used. For the Benediction they must be
treated as liquors, not as fruits.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[45:6](tbr38.htm#fr_288.md) *the fruit of the
tree*. Unmixed wine was usually not drunk, it must therefore not have
the same Benediction as wine mixed with water. Cf. [p.
64](tbr45.htm#page_64.md).

<span id="fn_288"></span>[45:7](tbr38.htm#fr_289.md) *are all one*. Because
both are from the vine.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[46:1](tbr38.htm#fr_290.md) Not verbally in SA,
and so with most of the Benedictions in this section.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[46:2](tbr38.htm#fr_291.md) *the seeds*. Food,
other than bread, prepared from any of "the five species of grain"
(wheat, barley, rye, oats and spelt (*cf*. SA, p. 287). Cf. *infra*, pp.
[47](#page_47), [53](tbr40.htm#page_53.md).

<span id="fn_291"></span>[46:3](tbr38.htm#fr_292.md) *this is its
Benediction*. It is unnecessary to repeat the usual formula of SA, p.
278.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[46:4](tbr38.htm#fr_293.md) R. Judah grants that
R. Jose is right if the figs are uncooked, but not otherwise.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[46:5](tbr38.htm#fr_294.md) *out from the earth*.
SA, p. 278.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[46:6](tbr38.htm#fr_295.md) SA, p. 286, short old
form; pp. 280-282, long form.
