### A Bridegroom and the Shma‘. Gamaliel.

<span class="margnote">M.</span>II. 6 (5 *cont*.). A bridegroom is
exempt from reciting the Shma‘ on the first night, and until the Sabbath
is over, if he has not consummated the marriage. <span
id="fr_129"></span>[7](#fn_129.md) \[Connected with this is\] an incident
in the life of Rabban Gamaliel, who married and recited the Shma‘ on the
night he married. They said to him: Didst thou not teach us that a
bridegroom is exempt from reciting the Shma‘ on the first night? He said
to them: I will not listen to you,

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>that I should resign the kingdom of
heaven, for a single hour. <span id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_130.md)

**T**. I. 3. Bridegrooms and all who are occupied with fulfilling
(other) commandments are free from the duty of reciting the Shma‘. For
it is said: *When thou sittest in thine house*, <span
id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_131.md) which excludes those who are occupied
with fulfilling commandments. *And when thou walkest in the way* <span
id="fr_132"></span>[3](#fn_132.md) excludes bridegrooms.

II\. 10. The groomsmen <span id="fr_133"></span>[4](#fn_133.md) and all the
marriage guests <span id="fr_134"></span>[5](#fn_134.md) are free from the
Prayer, and from the phylacteries, the whole seven days (of the
wedding-feast). But they are bound to observe the recitation of the
Shma‘. R. Shela <span id="fr_135"></span>[6](#fn_135.md) said, The
bridegroom is free from obligation, but all the marriage guests are
under obligation.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_129"></span>[19:7](tbr19.htm#fr_129.md) But he must say the
Shma‘ in the morning.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[20:1](tbr19.htm#fr_130.md) Cf. Matt.
16<sup>23</sup>.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[20:2](tbr19.htm#fr_131.md) Deut 6<sup>7</sup>.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[20:3](tbr19.htm#fr_132.md) *ibid*. "The way" is
interpreted as an euphemism for marriage; *cf*. Gen. 19<sup>31</sup>.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[20:4](tbr19.htm#fr_133.md) *The groomsmen* (*ha
Shôshbînim*). Observe the plural. The *shôshbîn* was equivalent to our
"best man," but while at some periods and in some places only the
bridegroom had one, sometimes it was only the bride that had one, and
again sometimes both had. In any case many of the preliminaries of the
marriage were carried out by the *shôshbîn*. (Cf. John 3<sup>29</sup>.
See Krauss, ii, 457.)

<span id="fn_134"></span>[20:5](tbr19.htm#fr_134.md) *and all the marriage
guests* (*wkŏl* *bnê ha chuppah*). Literally, "and all the sons of the
marriage-chamber." This is the phrase in Matt. 9<sup>16</sup>.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[20:6](tbr19.htm#fr_135.md) *R. Shela*. Placed
sometimes among the Tannaim, or mishna teachers, but more usually among
the very earliest of the Amoraim, or commentators upon the mishna
itself. He was head of the School in Nehardea in Babylon about 200 A.D.
