#### Women Slaves and Children excluded. The Quantity of Food over which Grace must be said.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VII. 3 (2). Women, and slaves, and
little children, <span id="fr_376"></span>[4](#fn_375.md) are not invited
\[to say the Benediction\]. What is the least account of food which
qualifies for the invitation? Not less than the size of an olive. R.
Judah says not less than the size of an egg.

**T**. V. 14. All are under obligation to say in the case of the
Benediction after the meal: priests, Levites, and Israelites and
proselytes and slaves, freedmen, priests of illegitimate birth, <span
id="fr_377"></span>[5](#fn_376.md) Nethinim, and bastards, eunuchs of men,
and eunuchs by birth, <span id="fr_378"></span>[6](#fn_377.md) and eunuchs
of all kinds. <span id="fr_379"></span>[7](#fn_378.md) All are under
obligation, and can set the majority free from obligation. <span
id="fr_380"></span>[8](#fn_379.md) Persons of uncertain or double sex

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

are under obligation, but cannot set the majority free from the
obligation.

13\. One who is of double sex sets one like himself free \[from his
obligation\], but no one else; one who is of uncertain sex sets neither
free.

16\. One who is half a slave and half of free birth sets neither one
like himself nor any one else free \[from their obligation\].

17\. Women and slaves and children do not set the majority free from
their obligation. \[Yet\] in fact they say: <span
id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_380.md) A woman says the Benediction for her
husband, a son for his father, a slave for his master.

18\. A child who can eat anything about the size of an olive we include
in the invitation to say the Benediction, but him who cannot eat
anything about the size of an olive we do not. We do not insist on
preciseness with a child, whether he says, "Let us bless," or says,
"Blessed be He." We do not take him up for this, but the precisians do
take him up for this.

20\. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: If they have gone upstairs, and
have reclined at meat, and he dips his hands (in the dish) with them,
although he has not eaten with them \[any\] corn as much as an olive,
behold these invite him. <span id="fr_382"></span>[2](#fn_381.md)

11\. If a sweet relish comes to him in the middle of the meal, one says
the Benediction over the meal, and lets the sweet relish go free.

12\. R. Mona <span id="fr_383"></span>[3](#fn_382.md) says in the name of
R. Judah, A bit of bread that comes with dessert after food requires a
Benediction before it and after it.

13\. The first water (for washing before the meal) is a matter of
choice; the latter <span id="fr_384"></span>[4](#fn_383.md) (after the
meal) a

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

matter of obligation. In the case of the first water if one wishes to
leave off, one leaves off; but in the case of the latter water, if one
wishes to leave off one does not.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[60:5](tbr43.htm#fr_377.md) priests of
illegitimate birth (*chālālim*), *e.g.* sons of a priest who had married
a widow.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[60:7](tbr43.htm#fr_379.md) The language is that
of Deut. 23<sup>1</sup>.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[60:8](tbr43.htm#fr_380.md) *can set . . . free
from obligation*. By one of them saying the Benediction on behalf of
those who are present.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[61:1](tbr43.htm#fr_381.md) *they say*. *i.e.*
This is the Rule.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[61:2](tbr43.htm#fr_382.md) *these invite him*,
viz., to say the Benediction after the meal.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[61:3](tbr43.htm#fr_383.md) *R. Mona*. His usual
name, as it seems, is Mana. Evidently a mishna-teacher of the fourth
generation, c. 160-200 A.D.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[61:4](tbr43.htm#fr_384.md) *The first water . . .
the latter*. These become technical expressions for the ceremonial
washing before and after meals, and <span id="page_62">p. 62</span>
occur in the proverb: "\[The neglect of\] the first water makes one eat
pork \[for the host thinks one a Gentile\], and \[the neglect of \] the
latter water commits murder," *i.e.* one duty neglected brings about the
commission of a serious, but relatively small, sin, a second the
commission of a great one. The proverb is given summing up an
illustration of its truth, in T. B. *Yoma*, 83 *b*.
