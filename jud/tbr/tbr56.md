### BENEDICTIONS ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS.

#### Benedictions at Scenes of Miracles, or of Past Idolatry.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>IX. I. He who sees a place in which
miracles were wrought for Israel <span id="fr_451"></span>[5](#fn_450.md)
says: "Blessed be He who wrought miracles for our fathers in this
place." In the, case of a place from which idolatry was uprooted, he
says: "Blessed be He who uprooted idolatry from our land."

**T**. VII. 2. He that seeth idolatry says: Blessed be He who is slow to
anger. \[He that seeth\] a place from which idolatry was uprooted says:
Blessed be He who hath uprooted idolatry from our land; may it be
pleasing in Thy sight, O LORD our God, that idolatry be uprooted from
our land, and from all places in Israel, and mayest Thou turn the hearts
of them that worship idols to worship Thee.

He that seeth hosts <span id="fr_452"></span>[1](#fn_451.md) says: Blessed
be He who is wise in all these mysteries, for none of their countenances
is alike, nor their knowledge alike. <span

Ben Zoma saw hosts in the Temple area. He said: Blessed be He who
created all these to serve me. How much did Adam toil, and tasted not
one mouthful, until he had ploughed, and sowed, and reaped, and
harvested, and threshed, and winnowed, and sifted, and ground, and
bolted, and kneaded, and baked, and after that he ate! But I arise at
dawn and I find all these things already done for me. How much did Adam
toil, and clothed himself with not a single garment until he had shorn,
and cleansed, and beaten, and dyed, and spun, and weaved, and sewed, and
after that he clothed himself! But I arise at dawn and find all these
things already done for me. How many trades (*i.e.* tradesmen) are
anxious and rise early! But I arise at dawn and I find all these already
done for me.

And so Ben Zoma used to say: "What does a good guest say? Remember the
landlord for good! How many kinds of wine hath he brought before us! How
many kinds of portions of meat hath he brought before us! How many kinds
of fine bread hath he brought before us! All that he did, he did only
for my sake. But what does an evil guest say? Well, what have I eaten of
his? One bit of bread have I eaten of his; one portion of meat have I
eaten of his; one cup have I drunk of his; all that he did, he did only
for the sake of his wife and his children. And so it says "*Remember
that thou magnify His work, whereof men have sung*." <span
