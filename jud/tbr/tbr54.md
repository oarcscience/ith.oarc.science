#### If the Benediction after a Meal has been forgotten.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VIII. 8 (7). In the case of him who
has eaten, and has forgotten, and not said the Benediction—the School of
Shammai say: Let him return to his place <span
id="fr_435"></span>[1](#fn_434.md) and say it. The School of Hillel say:
Let him say it in the place where he remembers it. <span
id="fr_436"></span>[2](#fn_435.md) How long after may he say the
Benediction? Until the food in his bowels is consumed. <span
id="fr_437"></span>[3](#fn_436.md)

at the table.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[72:2](tbr54.htm#fr_436.md) The School of Hillel
presuppose the forgetfulness to be by pure accident: the School of
Shammai suggest that he should have been more careful.

hungry.
