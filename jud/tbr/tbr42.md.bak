<span class="margnote">. **M**.</span>VII. 1. Three persons who have

*Dmai* <span id="fr_366"></span>[2](#fn_365.md) and First Tithes from which
their Contribution has been taken, <span id="fr_367"></span>[3](#fn_366.md)
and Second Tithes <span id="fr_368"></span>[4](#fn_367.md) and consecrated
things <span id="fr_369"></span>[5](#fn_368.md) which have been
redeemed, <span id="fr_370"></span>[6](#fn_369.md) and the attendant who
eats as much as an olive, and the Cuthæan (Samaritan)—one gives no such
invitation <span id="fr_371"></span>[7](#fn_370.md) with respect to them.

2 (1). But as for him who eats Tebel, <span
id="fr_372"></span>[8](#fn_371.md) and First Tithes from which their

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>which have not been redeemed, also

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_364"></span>[59:1](tbr42.htm#fr_365.md) *to give an
invitation*. One of those present must invite the other two to join with
him in a Benediction at the end of a meal. SA, p. 279, with Abrahams'
note; *vide supra*, [p. 50](tbr40.htm#page_50.md).

<span id="fn_365"></span>[59:2](tbr42.htm#fr_366.md) *Dmai*. Literally,
"suspicion" or "talk." Fruits about which there is a suspicion whether
they have been tithed or not. The third treatise of the Mishna deals
with this subject, and is so called. For the duty of tithing see Lev.
27<sup>30</sup>.

<span id="fn_366"></span>[59:3](tbr42.htm#fr_367.md) *First Tithes from
which their Contribution has been taken*. For the Contribution see Num.
15<sup>19-21</sup>, and Driver's note on Deut. 12<sup>6</sup>. It is
said to have varied from the sixtieth to the fortieth part of the whole
untithed produce. The remainder was tithed.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[59:4](tbr42.htm#fr_368.md) *Second Tithes*, Num.
18<sup>26</sup>. The Second Tithe was taken from the remainder after the
First Tithe.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[59:5](tbr42.htm#fr_369.md) *consecrated things*.
As for example, Firstlings, Lev. 27<sup>26</sup> *sq*.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[59:6](tbr42.htm#fr_370.md) *which have been
redeemed*. This refers to the two last cases, for only if they were
redeemed could they be eaten. Redemption was made by giving the value of
the thing plus a fifth of that value, Lev. 27<sup>13, 31</sup>.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[59:7](tbr42.htm#fr_371.md) *one gives no such
invitation*. B omits the negative, and rightly, in view of the next
clause.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[59:8](tbr42.htm#fr_372.md) *Tebel*. Food from
which no Contribution or Tithe has been taken.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[60:1](tbr42.htm#fr_373.md) *the stranger*.
Neither Jew nor Samaritan.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[60:2](tbr42.htm#fr_374.md) *he eats with them*.
He makes a third person, enabling the formal invitation to be given. It
is understood that he is a Jew.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[60:3](tbr42.htm#fr_375.md) *until they give him
permission*. For his presence is not necessary.
