If there are two companies that are eating in one house when some of them [can] see the others, behold, they join themselves together to give the invitation [to say the Benediction]. But if not, then they give the invitation each party to themselves.</p>  
<p>They do not say the Benediction over the wine until one puts water into it. This is the opinion of R. Eliezer.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_397"></A><A HREF="#fn_396"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> But the Majority say: They say the Benediction.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_396"></A><A HREF="tbr46.htm#fr_397">64:3</A> <i>R. Eliezer</i>. His reason was that until water was mixed with the wine there was some doubt whether it was drunk (cf. <A HREF="tbr38.htm#page_45">p. 45</A>). The Majority assume it would be. The fact that our Lord spoke a Benediction over the wine at the Last Supper (Mark 14<sup>23</sup>; Matt. 26<sup>27</sup>; Luke 22<sup>17</sup>; and apparently 1 Cor. 11<sup>23-25</sup>). This supplies no evidence that water had been already mixed with it, if He followed the opinion of the Majority.</P>
