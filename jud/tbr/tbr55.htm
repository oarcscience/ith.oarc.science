<p>V. 21. In the case of a heathen who says the Benediction in the Name (of the Loan), they respond "Amen" after him. In the case of a Samaritan who says the Benediction in the Name (of the LORD), they do not respond "Amen" after him until the whole Benediction is heard.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_442"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

If one is offering meal-offerings in Jerusalem one says: "Blessed be He who kept us alive and brought us to this time"; when they eat he says: "Blessed be He who bringeth forth bread from the earth."</p>

Presumably the School of Shammai feared that the blessing over the wine might be forgotten if that for the food was given first.
