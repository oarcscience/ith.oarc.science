#### The Shma‘, etc., in cases of Sexual Uncleanness.

4\. He who is ceremonially unclean <span id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_148.md)
repeats the Shma‘ in his heart only, and does not say a Benediction
either before it or after it. But at a meal he says the Benediction
after but not before. <span id="fr_150"></span>[3](#fn_149.md) R. Judah
says: he says the Benediction before them and after them. <span
id="fr_151"></span>[4](#fn_150.md)

5\. Should one have begun to stand in the Prayer and then remember that
he is ceremonially unclean let him not make a pause, but say the

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>short form. Should one have gone
down to bathe, <span id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_151.md) if he can come out
and cover himself and recite, before the sun actually rises, let him
come out and cover himself and recite. But if not, let him cover himself
with water and recite. But he must not cover himself with dirty water,
nor with water used for steeping flax, <span
id="fr_153"></span>[2](#fn_152.md) until he has poured water into them. And
how far should he move from them, and from excrement? Four cubits.

6\. A man with a running issue, and a woman, at certain times, require
the bath. But R. Judah exempts them. (Summary only.)

**T**. II. 12. One ceremonially unclean and ill, who has poured over
himself nine qabs <span id="fr_154"></span>[3](#fn_153.md) of water, lo, he
recites (the Shma‘). But he does not set others free from their
obligation <span id="fr_155"></span>[4](#fn_154.md) until he enters into a
bath <span id="fr_156"></span>[5](#fn_155.md) containing forty
*seahs* <span id="fr_157"></span>[6](#fn_156.md). R. Judah says: He must
enter into a bath containing forty *seahs* in any case. <span
id="fr_158"></span>[7](#fn_157.md) They that have an issue, whether male or
female, and women in their separation, and they who are recovering from
childbirth, are permitted to read (aloud) in the Law, and to learn in
Mishna, and in Midrash, and in Halakoth and

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

Haggadoth, but they who are ceremonially unclean are forbidden all. R.
Jose says: Such a man learns in the Halakoth to which he is accustomed,
so long as he does not lay the mishna in order before others. <span
id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_158.md)

13\. One ceremonially unclean who has no water to bathe himself, lo, he
recites the Shim', but not loud enough for himself to hear it, and he
does not say the Benedictions either before or after it. Such is the
opinion of R. Meir. <span id="fr_160"></span>[2](#fn_159.md) But the
Majority say: he recites the Shma‘ and that aloud for himself to hear
it, he says the Benedictions before and after it. R. Meir said: Once we
were sitting in front of R. Aqiba and were reciting the Shma‘, but not
aloud for us to hear it, because of a quaestor who was standing at the
door. They said to him: A time of danger is no proof. <span
id="fr_161"></span>[3](#fn_160.md)

14\. Lo, if a man is standing in the open country naked, or doing his
work naked—lo, he must cover himself with straw or stubble or anything
else, and so recite \[the Shma‘\], in accordance with the saying, It is
not praiseworthy for a man to be standing naked; for when the Holy One,
blessed be He, created man He did not create him naked. For it is said:
"*When I made the cloud his garment and thick darkness his
swaddling-band*." <span id="fr_162"></span>[4](#fn_161.md) "When I made the
cloud his garment"—this means the sac; "and thick darkness his
swaddling-band—this means the placenta. Lo, a man who has an apron of
cloth or of leather girded on his loins, lo, he recites \[the Shma‘\].
But in either case the man does not say the Prayer until he covers his
heart.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

15\. A man may not put his head within \[the part of his dress that is
over\] his bosom, and so recite the Shma‘. <span
id="fr_163"></span>[1](#fn_162.md) But if his under-garment is girt closely
underneath it is allowable. Two men who sleep under one rug are not
permitted to recite the Shma‘ \[thus\]. But one covers himself with his
covering and so recites, and the other covers himself with his covering
and so recites. If they are his son or his daughter while they are still
young it is allowable.

16\. Si puer possit comedere quantitatem olivae, <span
id="fr_164"></span>[2](#fn_163.md) recedunt ab ejus stercore et urina
quatuor cubitos; non est recedendum nisi ab excrementis hominis, et
canum, quando in illis ponunt pelles. <span
id="fr_165"></span>[3](#fn_164.md) Scaphium excrementi, et matulam urinae,
si fuerit secum in domo, se removet quatuor cubitos, et legit. Si fuerit
ante lectum, injicit quantulumcunque aquarum, et legit; si minus, non
legit. R. Zakkai dicit, Si in illud injiciat quartarium <span
id="fr_166"></span>[4](#fn_165.md) aquae, legit; si minus, non legit.
Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel dicit, Si fuerit ante lectum, non legit, si
post lectum, legit. R. Simeon ben Eleazar dicit, Vel si domus pateat
decem cubitos, et scaphium excrementi in illa sit, non legit, nisi prius
operiat, et sub lecto deponat.

17\. A man may not enter into filthy alleys, and recite the Shma‘. And
not only so but even if he enter while he is reciting, lo, he leaves off
until he goes out of the legal limits <span
id="fr_167"></span>[5](#fn_166.md) of all that place, and then recites.

18\. A man may not stand and pray when he

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

feels he ought to relieve nature.' For it is said: *Prepare to
meet* <span id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_167.md) *thy God, O Israel*. <span
id="fr_169"></span>[2](#fn_168.md)

19\. Non mingit in loco ubi oravit, nisi quatuor cubitos recesserit. Qui
minxit non in illo loco orat, nisi quatuor cubitos recesserit. Si urina
siccetur aut absorbeatur, licet.

20\. He who enters into a bath—in a room where men are standing clothed,
recitation and Prayer, and it is needless to say religious greeting, may
take place there. He \[also\] puts on his Tephillin, and it is needless
to say he does not take them off (if he has already put them on). If it
is a room where men are standing, some naked and some clothed, religious
greeting may take place there, but not recitation and Prayer. He does
not take off his Tephillin and does not put them on to begin (his
devotions). If it is a room where men are standing naked religious
greeting may not take place there, and it is needless to say <span
id="fr_170"></span>[3](#fn_169.md) that he does not put on his Tephillin.

21\. Hillel the Elder <span id="fr_171"></span>[4](#fn_170.md) says: Show
not thyself naked, show not thyself clothed; show not thyself standing,
show not thyself sitting; show not thyself laughing, show not thyself
weeping; for it is said: "*A time to laugh and a time to weep;* 

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>a time to embrace and a time to
refrain from embracing." <span id="fr_172"></span>[1](#fn_171.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_148"></span>[23:2](tbr25.htm#fr_149.md) Lev. 15<sup>16</sup>.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[23:3](tbr25.htm#fr_150.md) *not before*. It was
ordered only by the Rabbis, not by the Law.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[23:4](tbr25.htm#fr_151.md) *them*. Both the Shma‘
and the meal (*vide supra*, [p. 19](tbr18.htm#page_19).md).

<span id="fn_151"></span>[24:1](tbr25.htm#fr_152.md) Lev. 15<sup>16</sup>.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[24:2](tbr25.htm#fr_153.md) *water used for
steeping flax*. This would presumably be disagreeable in both smell and
appearance. The growth of flax had of old, and probably will have in the
immediate future, an important place in the commercial life of
Palestine. One part of the preparation of the flax was for its stalks to
be soaked in a water-hole large enough for them to decay, when the
fibres would be more easily separated (Krauss, i. 139 *sq*.).

<span id="fn_153"></span>[24:3](tbr25.htm#fr_154.md) *nine qabs*. A qab is
four *logs*, or a sixth part of a *seah* (Krauss, ii. 393 *sqq*.).

<span id="fn_154"></span>[24:4](tbr25.htm#fr_155.md) As their leader in
prayer.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[24:5](tbr25.htm#fr_156.md) *a bath*. On the bath,
*cf*. Krauss, i. 217-233.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[24:6](tbr25.htm#fr_157.md) *forty seahs*. A
*seah* was over 213 pints. Observe that the regulation completely
excludes a mere sprinkling.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[24:7](tbr25.htm#fr_158.md) *in any case*. For his
own sake as well as for that of others.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[25:1](tbr25.htm#fr_159.md) *before others*. He
may learn for himself, but may not set it in order before others, for
the purpose of discussing it.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[25:2](tbr25.htm#fr_160.md) *R. Meir*. A mishna
teacher of the third generation, e. 130-160 A.D. He was pupil first of
R. Ishmael and then of R. Aqiba. His edition of the mishna depended on
that of R. Aqiba and was the basis of our mishna by R. Judah.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[25:3](tbr25.htm#fr_161.md) The fact that R. Meir
was in danger at the time is no proof that others who are not in
personal danger may say the Shma‘ so low.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[25:4](tbr25.htm#fr_162.md) Job 38<sup>9</sup>.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[26:1](tbr25.htm#fr_163.md) The object of the
whole of this, as of the preceding, section is to forbid any
unseemliness of act or thought while engaged in religious devotions.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[26:2](tbr25.htm#fr_164.md) *quantitatem olivae*.
It therefore does not apply to a baby.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[26:3](tbr25.htm#fr_165.md) *for tanning*. See
Krauss, ii. 261, 627.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[26:4](tbr25.htm#fr_166.md) *quartarium*. Either
as regards the whole vessel, or perhaps of a *log*.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[26:5](tbr25.htm#fr_167.md) *the legal limits*.
The word (*reshuth*) properly means the territory over which the
individual, or, in this case, the town, has rights. But here the phrase
seems to be used in the narrower sense of the town itself, exclusive of
outlying lands belonging to it.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[27:1](tbr25.htm#fr_168.md) *meet*. The same
Hebrew word as that translated "recite."

<span id="fn_168"></span>[27:2](tbr25.htm#fr_169.md) Amos 4<sup>12</sup>.
The recitation of the Shma‘ must always be seemly and decorous.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[27:3](tbr25.htm#fr_170.md) *and it is needless to
say*. The Erfurt MS. reads "(not) recitation and Prayer, and he puts off
his Tephillin, and it is needless to say that he does not put them on."

<span id="fn_170"></span>[27:4](tbr25.htm#fr_171.md) *Hillel the Elder*.
The next Hillel was so very much junior (Patriarch 330-365 A.D.) that
the epithet can hardly be given for the purpose of comparison with him.
It is rather a title of honour, and of supremacy in learning and wisdom.
In the *Siphra* (*Kdoshim* III. 7) on Lev. 19<sup>32</sup> we find: "R.
Jose the Galilean says, Elder (*ZaKêN*) means nought else than \`He who
has acquired wisdom' (*Zeh shKaNah chokmah*), for it is said 'The LORD
acquired me (KNani) as the beginning of His way' (Prov. 8<sup>22</sup>).
He is, by the bye, never called "Rabbi Hillel," except, as it seems, in
C of *Aboth* II. 5.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[28:1](tbr25.htm#fr_172.md) Eccles. 3<sup>4,
5</sup>. Observe that the words quoted are not consecutive. The passage
may mean that each duty has its fitting time, and it is ostentatious to
allow ourselves to be caught by the time for reciting the Shma‘ when we
are not duly prepared for it. So our Lord urges men not to pray standing
at the corners of the streets (Matt. 65). Cf. the warning at the end of
*M*. II. 8 ([p. 21](tbr20.htm#page_21).md).

But Bacher (*Ag. der Tanis*. I. 8) explains the passage as only the
development of another saying by Hillel (*Aboth* II. 5), "Separate not
thyself from the community." Then it will mean, Do not be doing things
at times when others are doing the opposite. But the former explanation
seems to suit the context better.
