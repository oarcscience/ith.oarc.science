### On Praying when Entering and when Leaving a Town.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>IX. 6 (4). He that enters into a
town prays two prayers—one on his entrance, and one on his exit. <span
id="fr_503"></span>[4](tbr59.htm#fn_502.md) Ben Azzai <span
id="fr_504"></span>[5](#fn_503.md) says: Four, two on his entrance, and two
on his exit. And one gives praise for

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>what is past, and calleth out for
what is about to come. <span id="fr_505"></span>[1](#fn_504.md)

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

**T**. VII. 16. He that entereth into a town prays two prayers, one on
his entrance and one on his exit. Ben Azzai says, Four; two on his
entrance and two on his exit. What does he say on his entrance? "May it
be pleasing before Thee, O LORD our God, that Thou wilt cause me to
enter this town in peace." If he has entered in peace he says: "I
acknowledge <span id="fr_506"></span>[2](#fn_505.md) before Thee that Thou
hast caused me to enter in peace. May it be pleasing before Thee, O LORD
my God, that Thou wilt bring me out of this town in peace." If he has
gone out in peace he says: "I acknowledge before Thee, O LORD my God,
that Thou hast brought me out of this town in peace, and even as Thou
hast brought me out in peace so mayest Thou cause me to walk in peace
and mayest uphold me in peace until I reach my home in peace."

17\. He that entereth into a \[public\] bath <span
id="fr_507"></span>[3](#fn_506.md) prays two prayers, one when he enters
and one when he goes out. When he enters he says: "May it be pleasing
before Thee, O LORD my God, that Thou wilt cause me to enter in peace,
and wilt bring me out in peace And let no mischief happen to me, <span
id="fr_508"></span>[4](#fn_507.md) and if any mischief happen to me let my
death be

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

an atonement  <span id="fr_509"></span>[1](#fn_508.md) for all my
iniquities, and deliver Thou me from this and all like it in the future
that is to come." <span id="fr_510"></span>[2](#fn_509.md) If he has gone
out in peace he says: "I acknowledge before Thee, O LORD my God, that
Thou hast brought me out in peace. Even so may it be pleasing before
Thee, <span id="fr_511"></span>[3](#fn_510.md) O LORD my God, that I may
come to my home in peace."

18\. R. Judah says: There are three Benedictions which one must say
every day: "Blessed be He who did not make me a Gentile"; "Blessed be He
who did not make me a woman"; "Blessed be He who did not make me an
uneducated man." <span id="fr_512"></span>[4](#fn_511.md) Blessed be He who
did not make me a Gentile—"*All the nations* (Gentiles) *are as nothing
before Him*." <span id="fr_513"></span>[5](#fn_512.md) Blessed be He who
did not make me a woman—for a woman is under no obligation to keep the
commandments. <span id="fr_514"></span>[6](#fn_513.md) Blessed be He who
did not make me an uneducated person—for no uneducated person fears
sin. <span id="fr_515"></span>[7](#fn_514.md)

They say in parables, To what is the matter like? To a king of flesh and
blood who told his servant to boil him some broth, though he had never
boiled him broth in his life. The result was he burnt the broth and
provoked his master. \[He told him\] to make him a fold to his shirt,
though he had never made him a fold to a shirt in his life.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

The result was that he soiled the shirt, and *T*. provoked his
master. <span id="fr_516"></span>[1](#fn_515.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_503"></span>[82:5](tbr60.htm#fr_504.md) *Ben Azzai*. Simeon
ben Azzai (a shortened form of Azariah) was one of the famous four, Ben
Azzai, Ben Zoma, Elisha ben Abujah, and Agiba (*c*. 110-135).

<span id="fn_504"></span>[83:1](tbr60.htm#fr_505.md) *for what is past . .
. for what is about to come*. *i.e.* the substance of his two prayers
both on entering and on leaving. They are thus four in all.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[83:2](tbr60.htm#fr_506.md) *I acknowledge*
(*môdeh ani*). *i.e.* in open thankfulness and praise. Cf.
ἐξομολογεῖσθαι Matt. 11<sup>25</sup>; Luke 10<sup>21</sup>; Rom.
14<sup>11</sup>, 15<sup>9</sup>.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[83:3](tbr60.htm#fr_507.md) *a* \[*public*\]
*bath*. It was dangerous more especially because of its elaborate
heating apparatus.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[83:4](tbr60.htm#fr_508.md) *happen to me*
(*ye’ra‘ bî*). Jastrow (p. 1382<sup>b</sup>) translates the parallel
passage in the Gemara, *T*. B. 60<sup>a</sup>, "that no mischief or sin
may occur through me," but the immediate reference to death seems to
preclude this.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[84:1](tbr60.htm#fr_509.md) *let my death be an
atonement*, cf. *supra*, [p. 13](tbr14.htm#page_13.md). Cf. *Yoma* VIII. 8:
"Death and the Day of Atonement make atonement, with repentance."

<span id="fn_509"></span>[84:2](tbr60.htm#fr_510.md) *all like it, in the
future that is to come*. *i.e.* the fire of Gehenna.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[84:3](tbr60.htm#fr_511.md) *even so . . . before
Thee*. Cf. Matt. 11<sup>26</sup>; Luke 10<sup>21</sup>.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[84:4](tbr60.htm#fr_512.md) *an uneducated man*
(*bôr*). The first two of these Benedictions are in SA, pp. 5 *sq*., but
for the third is given, "Who hast not made me a bondman."

<span id="fn_512"></span>[84:5](tbr60.htm#fr_513.md) Isa. 40<sup>17</sup>.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[84:6](tbr60.htm#fr_514.md) *the commandments*.
*i.e.* the many religious duties, not the fundamental duties towards God
and man.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[84:7](tbr60.htm#fr_515.md) *no uneducated person
fears sin*. How can he, in Rabbinic opinion, for he has no accurate
knowledge of what constitutes sin?

<span id="fn_515"></span>[85:1](tbr60.htm#fr_516.md) *provoked his master*.
The point of the parable is, that less is expected from a Gentile, a
woman, and an uneducated person. They are all ignorant of the specific
religious duties.
