This is a translation of Tractate Berakoth, a portion of the Mishna
which deals with prayer: specifically when, where and how to pray. It
includes the Mishna and the Tosephta commentary. This translation was
produced by a Christian scholar in the early 20th century. While
Williams is not hesitant to reference Christian texts, he is primarily
interested in how the rules expressed in this Mishna influenced the
early Christians, not in making a sectarian point. This adds some
comparative interest. In addition, the extensive scholarly apparatus
increases the value of this edition, the only complete public domain
translation of this part of the Mishna.
