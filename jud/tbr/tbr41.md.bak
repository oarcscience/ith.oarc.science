#### The Entrance on the Sabbath, the Meal, and the Benedictions.

**T**. V. 1. A man does not eat on the eve of the sabbath from the
afternoon <span id="fr_356"></span>[5](#fn_355.md) and onwards, so that he
may enter on the sabbath with desire. These are the words of R. Judah.
R. Jose says: He continues to eat until the time that it is getting
dark.

2\. An incident \[is related\] of Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel and R.
Judah and R. Jose, that they were reclining at a meal in Accho, and the
holy

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

day drew on. <span id="fr_357"></span>[1](#fn_356.md) Rabban Simeon ben
Gamaliel said to R. Jose: Let us leave off for the sabbath. <span
id="fr_358"></span>[2](#fn_357.md) He said to him: Every single day dost
thou prefer my words of Judah, and now thou preferrest the words of
Judah to mine! "*Will he even force the queen with me in the
house?*" <span id="fr_359"></span>[3](#fn_358.md)

He said to him: If so let us not leave off. Perhaps you \[two\] will
decide the Rule in Israel. <span id="fr_360"></span>[4](#fn_359.md) They
say that they did not move thence until they had decided the Rule
according <span id="fr_361"></span>[5](#fn_360.md) to the words of R. Jose.

3\. In the case of guests who are reclining at a meal near the master of
the house, and the holy day has drawn on, they move with the darkness to
the Lecture Hall, <span id="fr_362"></span>[6](#fn_361.md) and, when they
return, mix them the cup, saying over it the sanctification of the
day. <span id="fr_363"></span>[7](#fn_362.md) Such are the words of R.
Judah. R. Jose says: Each eats on until the time that it is dark. <span
id="fr_364"></span>[8](#fn_363.md)

4\. When the first cup is mixed for him (the master of the house) he
says over it the Benediction after the meal, and makes mention of the
Benediction

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

of the sabbath in the Benediction after the meal. And at the second
\[cup\] he says over it the sanctification of the day.

began, for darkness came on.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[58:2](tbr41.htm#fr_358.md) *Let us leave off for
the sabbath*. For this meal belongs to the weekday; let us honour the
sabbath by beginning a fresh one.

Or perhaps, according to the Vienna MS., and T. J. *Pesachim* 37

the other.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[58:5](tbr41.htm#fr_361.md) *according to the

In order to be occupied with Torah when the sabbath begins.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[58:7](tbr41.htm#fr_363.md) *the sanctification of
the day*. This was originally said only in the house, and its use in the
synagogue "arose from the custom of entertaining and lodging wayfarers
in the Synagogue precincts, and thus the rite was part of the meal
provided for the communal guests" (Abrahams on SA, p. 124). See also
Elbogen (p. 111), who dates the observance in the synagogue from the
earliest Gemara teachers in Babylon (c. 200 A.D.).

<span id="fn_363"></span>[58:8](tbr41.htm#fr_364.md) *dark*. For not until
then is it necessary to light the sabbath lamp, and to say the necessary
prayer.
