#### The Order of the Benedictions about Various Objects at the End of Sabbath.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VIII. 5. The School of Shammai say:
Lamp and food and spices <span id="fr_417"></span>[5](#fn_416.md) and
*Habdalah*. <span id="fr_418"></span>[6](#fn_417.md) But the

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span> School of Hillel say: Lamp and spices and food and
Habdalah.

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

**T**. VI. 6. R. Judah said: The School of Shammai and the School of
Hillel had no dispute about the Benediction after the meal, that it is
pronounced at the beginning (of the prayer), or over the *Habdalah* that
it is pronounced at the end. About what did they dispute? About the lamp
and about the spices. For the School of Shammai say \[the Benediction\]
over the lamp, and afterwards \[over\] the spices; and the School of
Hillel say: Spices, and after that, Lamp.

He who entereth into his house at the end of sabbath says the
Benediction over the wine, and over the lamp, and over the spices, and
says the *Habdalah*. And if he has only one cup he reserves it for after
the meal, and strings them altogether \[in a Benediction\] after it; and
one says the *Habdalah* at the end of sabbath, and at the end of a
festival, and at the end of the Day of Atonement, and at the end of a
sabbath for a festival, <span id="fr_419"></span>[1](#fn_418.md) and the
end of a festival for the ordinary day of the feast.

He who is accustomed \[to use such forms\] says many *Habdaloth*, <span
id="fr_420"></span>[2](#fn_419.md) and he who is not accustomed says one or
two.

In the Lecture Hall, the School of Shammai say: One person says the
Benediction for them all, and the School of Hillel say: Each single one
says the Benediction for himself. <span id="fr_421"></span>[3](#fn_420.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_416"></span>[68:5](tbr51.htm#fr_417.md) *spices*. As the
custom of burning spices at the close of meals (*M*. VI. 6, *supra*, [p.
48](tbr40.htm#page_48).md) "was intermitted on the sabbath, the bringing in
of spices became associated with the end of the sabbath" (Abrahams on
SA, p. 216).

<span id="fn_417"></span>[68:6](tbr51.htm#fr_418.md) *Habdalah*, [p.
39](tbr33.htm#page_39.md).

<span id="fn_418"></span>[69:1](tbr51.htm#fr_419.md) *for a festival*. When
a sabbath immediately precedes a festival.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[69:2](tbr51.htm#fr_420.md) *Habdaloth*. The
plural may refer to vanity in the Benedictions, or in the citations from
Scripture, or to the enumeration of various "distinctions."

<span id="fn_420"></span>[69:3](tbr51.htm#fr_421.md) *Each . . for
himself*. Perhaps because they are continually coming and going. Cf.
*supra*, [p. 63](tbr44.htm#page_63.md).
