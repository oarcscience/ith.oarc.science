### <span class="smallcaps">Humility as a Worldly Advantage—Contentment</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Humility</span> is profitable to man in this
world, because it makes him rejoice in his lot. For the whole

world, and all it contains, is insufficient to satisfy the ambition of
him into whom pride and a sense of greatness have entered, and he will
look with contempt on whatever share of it falls to his lot; whereas,
the humble man assigns no special rank to himself, but is content with
whatever comes to him, and finds it sufficient. And this induces
restfulness of soul, and minimises anxiety. He will eat what comes his
way, and dress in the raiment that is readily found; and a small share
of the world satisfies him.

The humble also bear troubles with greater fortitude than do the proud.
