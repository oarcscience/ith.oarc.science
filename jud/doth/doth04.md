*The Duties of the Heart*, by Rabbi Bachye, tr. by Edwin Collins,
\[1909\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span class="smallcaps">Seek no Reward but Wisdom's Self</span>

<span class="smallcaps">But</span> it is forbidden to us to study it for
purposes of worldly advantage; but from the single motive of <span
class="smallcaps">Love Alone</span>. The Rabbis say: "Do things for the
sake of the work itself, and speak the words \[of the law\] for their
own sake. Thou shalt neither make the *Torah* a crown, to magnify
thyself with it, nor a spade to dig with." And they say, in reference to
words of Psalm cxii., "'Happy is the man who fears the Eternal, and
delighteth greatly in His Commandments,' Rabbi Eliezar explains
delighteth greatly in His Commandments, themselves, and not in the
merit, or in any reward, spiritual or material, attached to their
performance, as we have learned,' 'be not like servants that serve their
master for the sake of receiving a reward, but be ye like servants who
serve their master with the intention of receiving no reward, and let
the awe of Heaven be upon you.'"
