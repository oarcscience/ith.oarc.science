*The Duties of the Heart*, by Rabbi Bachye, tr. by Edwin Collins,
\[1909\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span class="smallcaps">Gratitude is due for Good Intentions</span>

<span class="smallcaps">All</span> admit that our obligation to
benefactors is in proportion to their intention to benefit us, and that
even if, through some accident or hindrance, their deeds fall short of
their goodwill, and they fail to do us good; . . . while, on the other
hand, we owe no debt of gratitude to those by whose acts we are
benefited without their intending to do us good. It will now be shown
that while in almost all the motives to human benevolence self-interest
plays a part, the benevolence of God is entirely disinterested.
