### (<span class="smallcaps">From the Gate of Humility.</span>)

### <span class="smallcaps">The Danger of Pride</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> man who does good works is more

mischance; and its effect on conduct is injurious in the extreme.
Therefore, among the most necessary of virtues is that one which
banishes pride; and this is humility.
