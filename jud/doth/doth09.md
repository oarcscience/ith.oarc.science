*The Duties of the Heart*, by Rabbi Bachye, tr. by Edwin Collins,
\[1909\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span class="smallcaps">The Dual Duty of the Dual Man</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Man</span> is made up of body and soul; and both
alike are given us by the beneficence of the Creator. The one is
visible, and the other invisible. We are therefore bound to serve Him
with a twofold service. That of the body and its members can be
fulfilled by the visible activities of man; but the second is a hidden
service, which is the fulfilment of the duties of the heart—to
acknowledge the Unity of God in our hearts, to believe in Him, to love
Him, resign our souls to Him, and make His name the unifying central
thought of all our conduct.
