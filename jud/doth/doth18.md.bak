<span class="smallcaps">When</span> you understand the mystery of
movement and the dynamic laws of the universe, and realise how these, in
their working, are among the greatest wonders of the wisdom of God, and
you recognise how great has been the mercy of the Creator to His
creatures in the operation of these laws, then it will be clear to you
that all your movements are bound and controlled by the pleasure of the
Creator, blessed be He, and His providence, and His will—the smallest
and least important as well as the greatest, the obvious as well as
those that are hidden—with one great exception: that.
