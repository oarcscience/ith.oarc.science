This slim volume translates from the Rabbi Bachye, who wrote one of the
first systematic treatments of philosophical Ethics in 12th century
Spain. This was during a period of Jewish intellectual
cross-fertilization with Islamic culture. Although Bachye was an
orthodox Rabbi, he treats Ethics (the Duties of the Heart, in his words)
as a universal science, derived from first principles such as the belief
in God. This short book also runs very deep.

According to the introduction to this book, this was the first text to
be published in the [Wisdom of the East](../../woe/index.md) series. So if
you collect these you might want to be on the watch for copies of this
specific volume. The particular edition we ended up using is a second
printing, but there is no reason to suggest that it had any differences
with the first edition.
