### <span class="smallcaps">The Gates of Knowledge</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Three</span> gates the Creator has opened to
mankind, so that they may enter into the domain of spirituality, ethical
conduct and the laws divine, that guide us in our works and daily life
to health of body and of mind and soul. The first is the lofty portal of
pure Reason, with all obstructing errors cleared away; the second is the
book of the Torah, <span id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2.md) revealed to Moses,
the prophet; the third is built up of traditions.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2"></span>[17:\*](doth06.htm#fr_3.md) *Torah*, literally
guide, instruction, but generally translated "Law," is a word used in
Hebrew literature with several distinct meanings:—(1) The Pentateuch, as
distinguished from the rest of the Bible; (2) Scripture, any part of the
O.T., as distinguished from The Talmud Rabbinic opinions and traditions;
(3) The *Contents* of the Bible and Talmud, together with scientific,
medical, ethical, or other facts or theories, studied for the purpose of
elucidating the spiritual meaning, or practical application, of the
Mosaic Law; (3a) the habit of studying *Torah* in the sense (3), *i.e.*,
Religion, hygiene and ethics, etc., based upon principles traceable to
the Pentateuch.
