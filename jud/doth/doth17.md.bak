### <span class="smallcaps">The Examination of Creation Shows the Goodness of the Creator</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> way in which man can most readily
arrive at a knowledge of God is by a critical study of the works of
creation in general, and of man in particular.

The result of this examination will be to show you that the Creator is
not only wise but infinitely good and beneficent, and that His goodness
is over all His works.
