### (<span class="smallcaps">From the Gate of Unity</span>.)

### <span class="smallcaps">Belief in the Existence of One Creator as the Basis of Ethics</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Perfect</span> recognition of the existence and
unity of God forms the only sure basis for right thought and conduct.
For gratitude to the beneficent Creator of the universe, and admiration
of creation, involve the reasoned resolve to benefit all His creatures,
study His works, and raise our souls, perfecting them; and tends to love
of Him, resulting in obedience to His will, whether revealed through
Nature or through human agency, or in our innate faculties for
recognising justice and the good.

The love of God, and the consequent acceptance of the yoke of duty in
obedience to His will, is, in the Scripture passage that strikes the
key-note of the faith of Israel, placed after the injunction to
understand that the Creator exists, that the Eternal is God, and that He
is One. (Hear and understand, <span id="fr_6"></span>[\*](#fn_5.md) O
Israel, the Eternal is our God, the Eternal is One) (Deut. vi.).

The unity of conduct, and the concentration of our love and striving
after good, require belief in One, and only one, Creator, the source of
good.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_5"></span>[23:\*](doth15.htm#fr_6.md) Bachye is only following
many Hebraists, and not at all straining the sense, when he renders
"Shemang," in this verse, "Understand," or hearken, instead of "hear."
