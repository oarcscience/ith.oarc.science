### <span class="smallcaps">Contemplation Leading to Communion with God</span>

<span class="smallcaps">If</span> the believer will constantly meditate
on the fact that the Creator sees all his thoughts and deeds, and will
think it over with his own soul, the Creator will be constantly with
him, and he will see Him with his mind's eye, and be in constant awe and
reverence of Him; and he will examine all his conduct. And when this has
become a constant habit of his mind, he will, helped by God, have
reached the highest degree of the pious ones, and the most exalted rank
of the righteous. He will not lack anything; nor will he choose anything
more than the Creator has chosen for him. His will depends upon the will
of the Creator, and his love on the love of the Creator; and that is
loved by him which He loves, and that is contemned by him which is
contemned by the Creator.

A man should commune with himself in reference to the desires of his
heart and his worldly

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

tastes; and a careful consideration of the ends they serve will lead him
to look with contempt on ephemeral possessions; and his thoughts and
desires will be fixed on the highest good, and on what is of eternal
value to his mind and soul; and he will learn to strive only for what is
barely necessary of the things of this world. He will desire to be kept
from both poverty and riches, so that he may have enough for simple
healthy life; and he will yearn after wisdom and spiritual possessions,
of which no one can rob him.

Another subject for self-communing is the question as to whether we have
made proper provision for the journey we must one day make, to another
world, just as a traveller does not wait till he is on a journey before
making provision for his necessities while travelling.

Another subject that should not be neglected, in the communing with
one's own soul, is the inclination of the soul to seek the fellowship of
the sons of men and the advantages of solitude and of separation from
men, and the evil of associating ourselves with their follies when we
are not forced to do so. Too much talking is calculated to lead to the
talking of slander and the telling of lies, and even to the taking of
false oaths. One of the *Chassideem* said to his disciples: "The *Torah*
permits our swearing by the name of the Creator to what is true, but I
counsel you not to take an oath by the holy name of God, whether to the
truth or to a lie. Say simply 'Yes,' or 'No.' Too much social
intercourse also leads to boasting and displaying one's knowledge.

The pure of heart will always love solitude. But

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

here again the temptation to complete solitude must also be guarded
against. For the society of philosophers, the pious, and of great men,
is of great advantage.

One should also consider well, in communing with his soul, whether he
has made the best use of any wealth that he may possess, doing good with
it. And he should meditate also on the many ways in which one man can
help another; and consider that he should love for others what he loves
for himself, and hate for others what he hates for himself, rejoicing in
their joy and grieving at their sorrow. And he should be full of
compassion for them, and ward off from them, to the utmost of his power,
anything that may injure them; as it is said (Levit. xix.), "And thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
