*The Duties of the Heart*, by Rabbi Bachye, tr. by Edwin Collins,
\[1909\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span class="smallcaps">All Conduct is Conditioned by the Heart</span>

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> is quite clear to me that even the
duties of the body and its members can never be perfectly fulfilled,
except with a willing heart, and a soul that delights to do them, and
when our heart is really full of yearning for the work that they
involve. And should the thought arise in our minds that our moral
obligation requires only outward acts of goodness, and that our hearts
are not in duty bound to choose

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

the service of The Infinite <span id="fr_5"></span>[\*](#fn_4) and to
delight in it, then the obligation to ethical conduct would also be
removed from the body and its members. For no act of any kind is done
completely unless the soul delights in doing it.

Moreover, with regard to any sinful conduct, it is not the act itself,
but the sinful intention, by which one incurs guilt. It is only when the
heart co-operates with the bodily members in the commission of an
offence that guilt is incurred; so that it is the intention of the heart
that is the principal element in either virtue or vice, and he who does
a meritorious action unintentionally is still without merit. Thus the
essential thing in all conduct is the intention of the heart.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_4"></span>[21:\*](doth10.htm#fr_5) The Rabbis frequently
used this term for God. Hashem = <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
name, *i.e.*, the Divine name of four letters, derived from *hajah*, to
exist, which was thought too sacred to pronounce in come-on speech, and
the meaning of which connotes absolute, infinite existence.
