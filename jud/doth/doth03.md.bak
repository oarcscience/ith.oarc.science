# THE DUTIES OF THE HEART

### <span class="smallcaps">Wisdom, the Highest Good</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> supreme benefit, and the highest good
bestowed by the Creator on human beings (after the gift of existence and
the perfected faculties of perception and intelligence), is Wisdom.
This, indeed, is the very life of their spirits. It is the lamp of their
reason, which enables them to come to the will of God, and delivers them
from all disaster in this world and in the world to come.

This Wisdom, or Philosophy, is of three kinds: the Philosophy of Nature,
dealing with the properties and accidents of Matter; the Philosophy of
Number and Measurement, the Mathematical Wisdom, including Astronomy and
Music; and Philosophy, properly so called, including the knowledge of
God, and the knowledge of His laws, and the rest of the sciences that
are concerned with life and mind, and with human souls and spiritual
beings. But all divisions of Wisdom are gates which the Creator, Blessed
be He, has opened to human beings to enable them to attain to religion
and the

world. Only some of these sciences are more necessary to the subject of
Religion, and other divisions are more necessary for the attainment of
worldly advantage. The highest form of Wisdom, the Divine Wisdom, is
that which is most necessary to Religion. It is our duty to study this
philosophy, in order, by means of Reason and discriminating
intelligence, to attain to our religion, to morality and the laws of
life that make for the health of our bodies and our souls. <span
