### <span class="smallcaps">Habits of those that love God.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> customs of the lovers of the Eternal
are too numerous to recount. Nevertheless, I will mention a few of them
that come opportunely to my mind.

These men have learned to know their God with a practical and fruitful
knowledge. <span id="fr_25"></span>[\*](#fn_22) . . . They have
recognised His delight in them and how He shapes their way, and they
perceive that it is He who makes their lives to

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

flow as a gentle stream, <span id="fr_26"></span>[\*](#fn_23) and that
it is He who nourishes and supports them. They have recognised His rule
and His restraining power in all those affairs—whether of religion,
ethics, holiness, and physical purity, or of the world—in which He has
given them permission to occupy themselves, and liberty of choice as to
their conduct. And it has become clear to them, and they firmly believe,
that all their affairs and their every movement are conducted by the
decree of the Creator, blessed be He, and by His pleasure. And they have
resolved <span id="fr_27"></span>[†](#fn_24) not to be guided by their
own preferences, but to rest in perfect trust upon the Creator, trusting
that He will choose what is best and what is proper for them.

  .     .     .     .     .     .     .

Even where they cannot show in actual deed the carrying out of their
good intentions, and even when weakness prevents the attainment of their
ideals in the fulfilment of God's law, they will choose to do these
things at any future time when they may be enabled to by the help of
God, and they will hope and pray for that time, appointed by Him. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[‡](#fn_25)

The longing after pleasures is rooted out, because there has entered
into them a longing to serve the Creator, and the fire of passion is
extinguished in their hearts, and all fierce heat of the imagination, by
reason of the strong light of the service of God that envelopes their
hearts, even as the light of a lamp pales and wanes in the light of the
sun.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

They are humble because of the fear of God. . . . When one speaks with
them they are wise, and when one questions them they show knowledge, and
when any sin against them they are meek.

If thou lookest at them, light seems to have descended on them, and if
you could look into their hearts you would find them contrite before
God. They are simple in worldly affairs, but at home in discourse about
God. For their hearts are full of the love of God. . . . They have
rejected all ways of corruption and chosen the best paths.

  .     .     .     .     .     .     .

They find obedience to the commandments given in the Pentateuch
inadequate to satisfy their yearning to serve God and do His will . . .
and they learn the ways of the Prophets and the customs of the pious to
seek therein examples of doing the will of God, so that they may follow
it.
