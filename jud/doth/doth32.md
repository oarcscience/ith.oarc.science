### <span class="smallcaps">Consistent Humility and Sincerity</span>

<span class="smallcaps">He</span> who is humble before God should be
meek and modest in all the affairs of the world; both in what is seen
and in what is secret; in his speech and in his actions; in his bodily
activities, and when at rest; and what is in his heart and mind must not
be the opposite to what is manifest about him; and all his actions must
be well pondered and suitable, equal, equable, and constant, and must
tend in the direction of humility and lowliness, both towards God and
man . . . and our sages say, <span id="fr_11"></span>[\*](#fn_10.md) "Be
lowly of spirit in the presence of every man."
