### <span class="smallcaps">The Proper Study of Mankind is Man</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Although</span> it is incumbent upon us to
investigate and study the whole universe, so as to understand the wisdom
and goodness of the Creator, the subject most necessary to study, as
well as the nearest and most obvious, is the evidence of divine wisdom
shown in all that concerns the human species. For man is the universe in
little (microcosm), and the proximate cause of the existence of the
great world (macrocosm). And it is our duty to study the origin of man
and his history; his birth, and the composition and structure of his
component parts, and the members and organs of his body, their relations
to each other, and the functions and purposes of every one of them; and
the necessity of his being made as he is, in structure, form, and
appearance. And then we

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

must consider the objects of his being and all his mental qualities and
characteristics, and the powers of his soul, and the light of his
reason, and all the essentials and accidentals of his being, and his
passions and desires, and his relation to the scheme of Creation.

From the standpoint of this study much of the mystery of the universe,
and many of the secrets of this world, will become clear to us, because
of the likeness of man to the world; and it has been said by some of the
wise men that Philosophy is man's knowledge of himself: that is to say,
such knowledge of man will enable us to recognise the Creator from the
signs of His wisdom displayed in man. This is the meaning of what Job
said: "And from my flesh I shall see God."

  .     .     .     .     .     .     .

The tongue is the pen of the heart, and the messenger of the distant
hidden soul.

  .     .     .     .     .     .     .

In speech one can see the superiority of man over the lower animals.

  .     .     .     .     .     .     .

It is the fools who think they know everything, and in their pride
neglect that study of the world and man, which would compel gratitude to
God, and life devoted to His service and the doing of good works.

  .     .     .     .     .     .     .

When you have studied all that can be known of

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

the universe, do not think that you know all about the wisdom and power
of God. For in the world, we know, God has only manifested just so much
of His wisdom and power as were necessary for the good of man. Not
according to the reach of His wisdom and power is their manifestation in
the phenomenal world (for they are infinite), but in accordance with the
needs of His creation and of His creatures.
