### <span class="smallcaps">Humility and Egotism</span>

<span class="smallcaps">He</span> who has true humility will be free
from all pride, conceit, self-praise and self-glorification, even in his
secret thoughts, when he is occupied in works of charity or other
virtuous or righteous acts, whether commanded or not; and in his own
soul he will account them as nothing in comparison to the greatness of
his obligation to God.
