### <span class="smallcaps">Aids to the Cultivation of Humility</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Among</span> the aids to the cultivation of
proper humility are the contemplation of the greatness of man's
obligation to the Creator and the thought of how small is his fulfilment
of his duties, whether those commanded by his own Reason or by
Scripture. Another is contemplation of the wonders of the universe and
on the insignificance of man in comparison with even this earth, while,
in comparison with the greatness of the Creator, the whole universe,
even the highest sphere, <span id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_9.md) is as
nothing.

If a man fills his mind with these and similar thoughts, he will be
continually humble, until humility has become a part of his very nature,
and all pride and arrogance and haughtiness are removed from his

heart, and this will deliver him from sin and error; as our sages, of
blessed memory, say: "Think of three things and thou wilt never fall
into sin; whence thou comest, whither thou goest, before whom thou hast
to render an account."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9"></span>[35:\*](doth30.htm#fr_10.md) In summarising, I have,
here, been careful not to modernise the *form* of B's thought too much.
Of course, its substance is as valid now as in the days of the
Copernican astronomy.
