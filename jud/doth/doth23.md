### <span class="smallcaps">The Motive Forces that Impel Man to Grateful Service</span>

<span class="smallcaps">There</span> are two distinct motive forces
impelling man to humble and grateful service of God. One of them is
inherent in human reason, implanted in man's intelligence, and hidden
deep within the very roots of his being; the second is acquired by means
of his hearing and understanding. This second is the Torah. <span

The service due to the humility of hope and fear is that which arises
from the acquired, external motive which enforces the obligation with
rewards and punishments in this world and in the world to come; the
second kind is induced by the working of the hidden motive force of
Reason, innate in human nature, and bound up with the union of man's
soul to his body. Both kinds of humility are praiseworthy, and both lead
to a right way of life and conduct; but the one is the complement of the
other, and the motive of the Torah is the stepping-stone to both, while
the motive of Reason, and the way of proof, is the preferable and nearer
to God.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Reason is free
from all suspicion of hypocrisy, and from all admixture of hope or fear.
It springs from a philosophic knowledge of how the creature is indebted
to the Creator, and is not restricted to actual outward acts, but will
include the ethical working of the heart and mind—the fulfilment of the
duties of the heart.
