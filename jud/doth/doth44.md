### <span class="smallcaps">The Motives to Repentance.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> first and chief motive to repentance
is when a man comes to recognise the nature of his God, and examines and
ponders over the continuity of God's goodness to him, and what a debt of
grateful service he owes to Him. . . . The second motive to repentance
is when warnings and rebukes come to man from the Creator, and make him
ashamed of the evil of his doings, either through the agency of a
prophet in his generation, or through the Bible, or by the mouth of some
teacher of the service of God. For no age or generation is without such
men, as our sages say: "Ere yet the sun of Moses had set, the sun of
Joshua rose; before the sun of Eli had set, that of Samuel his pupil
shone forth; before the sun of Elijah had set rose that of Elisha." On
the day when R. Akiba died was born our holy teacher, <span

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

in this way it will be found that in every age and in all countries
there will never be wanting men to call people to God, and to His
service, and to teach the Torah.

The third motive to repentance is . . . when a man returns to God
because of trials and fear of punishments.

The fourth motive to repentance is when a man is only awakened to repent
when he is shaken by troubles and sorrows, and sees in them a punishment
for sin, and wakes up from his sleep \[of apathy\], and returns to God.

But happy is he who is moved to repentance in the first manner.
