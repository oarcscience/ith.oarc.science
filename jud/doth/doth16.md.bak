### <span class="smallcaps">The Only True Unity.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> word One, in common speech, denotes
both accidental, transitory unity and a unity that is essential and
permanent. It is this essential and permanent unity that is true unity .
. . Even where the word one, in the sense of accidental unity, does not
refer to obviously collective units or composite wholes, such as
species, one army, etc., but is spoken of one man, even then it denotes
a plurality.

For it denotes a being composed of substance and form, of what is
essential and what is accidental; a being to whom existence and the loss
of existence come from without; a being subject to composition and
dissolution, change and subdivision, to classification, or association
with others of like kind. Such unity is not true unity. Lay this well to
heart.

Even when denoting absolute unity, the word One may be applied to a
thing that is one of a number. . . .

But essential, absolute, real, objective unity, that is unchangeable and
cannot be multiplied, and cannot be numbered among the qualities of
matter, to which being or the loss of being cannot be caused from
without, that is without beginning and without end, that cannot be moved
and cannot be compared to anything or have anything compared with it, or
be classed with anything, because it is One and unique from every point
of view and in every aspect: this alone is the true unity, the root and
cause of all collective or composite things. Such is the significance of
the word One, when we speak of the unity of God.
