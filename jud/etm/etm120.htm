<p>&sect; 1. A virgin is espoused on the fourth day [of the week], a widow on the fifth; because in towns the Bethdin sits twice a week, [namely] on the second and on the fifth [day], so that should he [the bridegroom] have to complain of non-virginity, he [presents himself] early [the next morning] before the Bethdin.</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. [If the person espoused is] a virgin, her Ketubah is two</p>  
<p><a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="green">p. 242</font></A></p>  
<p>hundred dinar; [if] a widow, [it is] a maneh.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_784"></A><A HREF="#fn_779"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> A virgin [who is] a widow, or divorced, or has performed chalitza, after betrothment [only, the marriage ceremony not having been completed, or the marriage consummated, in all such cases] their Ketubah is two hundred dinar, and they are amenable to the accusation of non-virginity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_785"></A><A HREF="#fn_780"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> A proselyte, a captive, and a bondwoman, who have been ransomed, converted, or manumitted at less than three years and one day [old], their Ketubah is two hundred dinar, and they are amenable to the accusation of non-virginity.</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. A minor,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_786"></A><A HREF="#fn_781"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> with whom an adult [male] has had carnal intercourse, a nubile maiden who has had such intercourse with a minor,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_787"></A><A HREF="#fn_782"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and [a virgin] fractured by accident,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_788"></A><A HREF="#fn_783"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> their Ketubah is two hundred dinar. Such is the dictum of R. Meir: but the sages hold [in the case of a virgin] fractured by accident [that] her Ketubah [is only a] maneh.</p>  
<p>&sect; 4. A virgin [who is] a widow or divorced, or has performed chalitza after espousals [only, the ceremony having been completed, but the marriage not consummated, in all such cases] their Ketubah is a maneh, and they are not amenable to the accusation of non-virginity. A proselyte, a captive, and a bondwoman, who have been ransomed, converted, or manumitted at more than three years and one day [old], their Ketubah is a maneh, and they are not amenable to the accusation of non-virginity.</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. He who in Judea has partaken [of the betrothment meal] at his father-in-law's without [any] witness [present], cannot prefer an accusation of non-virginity, because he was alone with her&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_789"></A><A HREF="#fn_784"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> [the bride].

<p>&sect; 6. He who espouses a wife, and discovers she has not her virginity, should she say, "After thou didst betroth me &#8207;&#1504;&#1488;&#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1497; &#1494;&#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1508;&#1495;&#1492; &#1513;&#1491;&#1498;&#8206;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_790"></A><A HREF="#fn_785"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> while he replies, "No, it is not so, but before I had betrothed thee [thou hadst lost thy virginity], consequently my bargain [with thee] was concluded in error:"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_791"></A><A HREF="#fn_786"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> [in his case] R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar say, "She is worthy of belief;" but R. Joshua saith, "Not by her assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to have been deflowered previous to her betrothment, and that she deceived him, unless she adduces proof to [support her assertion]."</p>  
<p>&sect; 7. Should she assert, "I have been fractured by accident," while he replies, "No, thou hast been deflowered by a man," R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar say, "She is to be believed;" but R. Joshua saith, "Not by her assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to have been deflowered by a man, unless she adduces proof to [support] her assertion."</p>  
<p>&sect; 8. If she is seen conversing [intimately] with a man in the street, and being asked, "Who is that man?" she replies, "He is A.B., a priest [or of legitimate Israelitish descent]," R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar say, "She is to be believed;" but R. Joshua saith, "Not by her assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to have been deflowered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_792"></A><A HREF="#fn_787"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> by a nethin or a bastard,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_793"></A><A HREF="#fn_788"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> unless she adduces proof to [support] her assertion."</p>  
<p>&sect; 9. If she is pregnant, and being asked, "by whom?" she replies, "By NN., who is a priest," R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar say, "She is to be believed;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_794"></A><A HREF="#fn_789"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> but R. Joshua saith, "Not by her assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to be pregnant by a nethin or a bastard, unless she adduces proof to [support] her assertion."</p>  
<p>&sect; 10. R. Jos&eacute; said, "It [once] happened that a girl went down</p>

<p>to draw water from the fountain, and she was violated [by a person unknown]." R. Jochanan ben Nouri decided, "That if the majority of the townsmen were [of pure descent and] qualified to intermarry with the sacerdotal race, this girl might be espoused by a priest."</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_784"></A><A HREF="etm120.htm#fr_789">242:7</A> In Judea the custom was for the father-in-law to make a repast at the time of betrothing, during which bride and bridegroom were left alone. This was done to accustom them to each others society; but the law presumes that he abused the opportunity, and therefore has no right to complain.</P>
