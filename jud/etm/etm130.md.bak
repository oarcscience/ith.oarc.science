### CHAPTER XI.

§ 1. A widow must be maintained out of the property of the
orphans, <span id="fr_939"></span>[1](#fn_934.md) and her earnings belong
to them; and they are not bound to \[defray the cost of\] her funeral.
Her heirs, who inherit her Ketubah, are bound to \[defray the cost of\]
her funeral.

§ 2. A widow, whether \[she become such\] after betrothment only, or
after \[actual\] marriage, may sell <span
id="fr_940"></span>[2](#fn_935.md) without applying to the Bethdin. R.
Simeon saith, "\[A widow\] after actual marriage, may sell without
applying to the Bethdin; <span id="fr_941"></span>[3](#fn_936.md) but \[a
widow\] after betrothment \[only\], must not sell, without \[previous
application to\] the Bethdin, because she \[the last named\] is not
entitled to her maintenance \[out of the husband's estate\]; and any
woman who is not entitled to a maintenance, must not sell, without
\[previous application to\] the Bethdin."

§ 3. Should she have sold, mortgaged, or given away \[to the whole
amount of\] her Ketubah, or \[to\] a part thereof, she must not sell the
remainder, <span id="fr_942"></span>[4](#fn_937.md) without \[previous
application to\] the Bethdin; but the sages hold, "She may make four or
five different sales <span id="fr_943"></span>[5](#fn_938.md) \[if\] she
sells for her necessary maintenance, \[and she may do it\] without
\[previous application to\] the Bethdin. \[In that case, however\] she
inserts \[in the deed of sale\], 'I make this sale for my \[necessary\]
maintenance.' A divorced woman must not sell without \[applying to\] the
Bethdin."

§ 4. Should a widow, whose Ketubah is two hundred dinar, sell part of
the land liable to her Ketubah \[to\] the value of one hundred dinar for
two hundred, or \[to\] the value of two hundred dinar for one hundred,
\[in either case it is held that\] she has received the full amount of
her Ketubah. <span id="fr_944"></span>[6](#fn_939.md) Should her Ketubah be
one hundred dinar,

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

and she has sold to the amount of one hundred and one dinar, the sale is
void; even though she offers to make good the one dinar to the orphans,
her sale is void. <span id="fr_945"></span>[7](#fn_940.md) R. Simeon ben
Gamaliel saith, "Her sale is always valid, <span
id="fr_946"></span>[8](#fn_941.md) unless she thereby prevents the orphans
from having a field of nine kab seed corn, or a garden of half a kab
seed corn." According to R. Akivah, "\[A garden of\] one-quarter kab
seed corn." <span id="fr_947"></span>[9](#fn_942.md) Should her Ketubah
amount to four hundred dinar, and she sells to one a hundred dinar
worth, and to another a hundred dinar worth, and to the last purchaser
she sells to the value of one hundred and one dinar for one hundred, her
last sale is void, but all her preceding sales are valid.

§ 5. Should a judicial appraisement be made either one-sixth too high,
or one-sixth too low, the sale \[made in consequence of such valuation\]
is void; but R. Simeon ben Gamaliel maintains "That the sale is valid,
for if it were otherwise, what would be the good of judicial
authority? <span id="fr_948"></span>[10](#fn_943.md) But if they \[the
Bethdin\] make public advertisement \[of the land to be sold\], even
though they sold what was actually worth one hundred dinar for two
hundred, or what was \[actually\] worth two hundred dinar for one
hundred, their sale is valid."

§ 6. She who refuses \[to cohabit with her husband\], <span
id="fr_949"></span>[11](#fn_944.md) or \[who is related to him in\] the
secondary \[degree of consanguinity\], <span
id="fr_950"></span>[12](#fn_945.md) or an ‏אילונית‎, <span
id="fr_951"></span>[13](#fn_946.md) are not entitled to any Ketubah, or
\[compensation for\] usufruct, <span id="fr_952"></span>[14](#fn_947.md) or
maintenance or \[compensation for\] wear and tear. <span
id="fr_953"></span>[15](#fn_948.md) If at the time of marriage he \[the
husband\] knew that she \[the bride\] was an ‏אילונית‎, she is entitled
to her Ketubah. A widow \[married\] to a high priest; a divorced woman,
or one who has performed \[the ceremony of\] *Chalitza*, <span
id="fr_954"></span>[16](#fn_949.md) \[married\] to an ordinary priest; a
bastardess,

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

or Nethineth <span id="fr_955"></span>[17](#fn_950.md) \[married\] to an
Israelite; or a daughter of Israel married to a bastard or Nethin, are
all entitled to their Ketubah.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[271:1](etm130.htm#fr_939.md) The children of her
deceased husband.

<span id="fn_935"></span>[271:2](etm130.htm#fr_940.md) The land on which
her Ketubah is secured.

<span id="fn_936"></span>[271:3](etm130.htm#fr_941.md) Because her Ketubah
is to supply her with her necessary maintenance. And as she could expend
it, had she received the amount in ready money without applying to the
Bethdin, she is entitled to raise money without any such application.

<span id="fn_937"></span>[271:4](etm130.htm#fr_942.md) Any addition to the
standard amount of two hundred dinar for a virgin, and one hundred for a
widow which may he settled upon her.

<span id="fn_938"></span>[271:5](etm130.htm#fr_943.md) She may sell the
land piecemeal, so as, by different sales, to realise the amount of her
Ketubah.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[271:6](etm130.htm#fr_944.md) She does not enjoy
the profit arising from her sale, although she must bear the loss
arising therefrom.

<span id="fn_940"></span>[272:7](etm130.htm#fr_945.md) Because she sold
what was not her own.

<span id="fn_941"></span>[272:8](etm130.htm#fr_946.md) And she need only
make good the dinar.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[272:9](etm130.htm#fr_947.md) A piece of land
equal to nine kab seed corn, is called a field, and to one-half kab seed
corn, is called a garden: of less size it is only a plot of ground.

<span id="fn_943"></span>[272:10](etm130.htm#fr_948.md) As that is resorted
to, because it is binding, and prevents disputes that might arise from
difference of opinion in cases of private valuation.

<span id="fn_944"></span>[272:11](etm130.htm#fr_949.md) Who having during
her minority been given in marriage by her mother or brothers, refuses
to live with her husband after she grows up. (Vide Treatise Niddah,
chap. VI. § 11.)

<span id="fn_945"></span>[272:12](etm130.htm#fr_950.md) (Vide Treatise

has enjoyed of her property.

<span id="fn_948"></span>[272:15](etm130.htm#fr_953.md) Which her property
has undergone during that time.

<span id="fn_949"></span>[272:16](etm130.htm#fr_954.md) Vide Treatise
Yebamoth, chap. I. § 2, note 2.

<span id="fn_950"></span>[273:17](etm130.htm#fr_955.md) Vide Treatise
Yebamoth, chap. VII. § 1.
