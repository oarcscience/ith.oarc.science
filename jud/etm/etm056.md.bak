### CHAPTER IX.

§ 1. All the roofs of a town <span id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_239.md)
\[form\] one reshuth, provided always there be not one roof, ten hands
higher or ten hands lower \[than the rest\]. Such is the dictum of R.
Meir; but the sages hold \[that\] every roof forms a separate reshuth.
R. Simeon saith, "Roofs, as well as courts and wood-stores \[inclosed
places, form\] one reshuth,

\[for \[the carrying and conveying of\] all \[such\] utensils as were
actually\] therein \[when\] the Sabbath-rest \[began\], but not for
those utensils \[which were\] in the house \[when\] the Sabbath-rest
\[began\]."

§ 2. If a large roof he next adjoining a small one, \[the owners of\]
the large \[roof\] are permitted \[to carry utensils thither from the
house\], but \[the owners of\] the small \[roof\] are prohibited \[so to
do\]. If a large court opens into a small one, through a gap \[or breach
in the wall\], \[the inmates of\] the large \[court\] are permitted \[by
means of erub to carry or convey through the breach\], but \[the inmates
of\] the small \[court\] are prohibited \[so to do\], because it \[the
smaller court\] is considered as a door \[entry\] to the large
\[court\]. If a court \[through the fall of its walls\] is laid open
towards the public reshuth, whosoever brings any thing from a private
reshuth into the court, or

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

from the court into a private reshuth, is guilty. Such is the dictum of
R. Eleazar. The sages hold, "that \[whoever brings any thing\] from the
court into the public reshuth, or from the public reshuth, is absolved;
since \[by the fall of its walls, and the consequent opening\] the court
is become like carmelith."

§ 3. A court, \[the corner walls of which have fallen down on the
Sabbath, so\] that \[it\] has been laid open towards the public reshuth
on two sides; and also a house \[which by the fall of the corner wall is
thus\] laid open on two sides; or an entry, the beam and posts of which
have been removed, it is permitted \[to the inmates to carry or convey
thence\] on that \[particular\] Sabbath; but it is prohibited \[so to
do\] for the future, \[on any subsequent day of rest\]. Such is the
dictum of R. Jehudah; but R José saith, "If it were permitted on that
\[particular\] Sabbath, it would also be permitted for the future; but
if it is prohibited for the future \[on any subsequent day of rest\], it
is also prohibited on that \[particular\] Sabbath."

§ 4. If an attic be built over two \[adjoining\] houses—likewise
bridges, the avenues to which are open at both ends—it is lawful \[to
carry or convey\] underneath on the Sabbath. Such is the dictum of R.
Jehudah; but the sages prohibit it. Moreover, R. Jehudah further said,
"It is lawful to combine, by \[means of\] erub, an alley that is open at
both ends," but the sages prohibit it.
