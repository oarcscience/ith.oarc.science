### CHAPTER VI.

§ 1. When one person says to another, "Receive this Get for my wife,"
or, "Bring this Get to my wife," he may, if he likes, take it back
again; <span id="fr_1044"></span>[1](#fn_1039.md) but when the wife said
\[to the messenger\], "Receive for me my Get," the husband cannot resume
it. Therefore, should a husband say to the messenger, "I do not wish
that you should receive it for her \[as her messenger\], but go and give
it her \[as my messenger\]," he may, if he likes, resume it again.
Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "Also, when the wife said, 'Fetch me
my Get,' the husband cannot take it back."

§ 2. A wife who had said, "Receive for me my Get," must produce two
\[sets or\] pairs of witnesses; two must testify \[and say\], "She
uttered this \[order\] in our presence," and two more to say, "The
messenger received the Get, and tore it up <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[2](#fn_1040.md) in our presence;" the same witnesses
may however testify to the truth of both assertions, or one of the first
and one of the second pair of witnesses may conjoin with them a third
person to bear testimony. A betrothed girl may either receive her Get
herself, or her father may receive it for her. R. Jehudah saith, "That
right cannot be possessed at the same time by both parties; but her
father only has a right to receive her Get." Any female who is too young
to take proper care of her Get, cannot be divorced at all.

§ 3. When a female minor said, "Receive my Get for me," the Get is
ineffective until it has reached her hands. Therefore, should the
husband wish to revoke the Get, he is at liberty to do so, because a
minor has not the power of appointing a messenger \[or deputy\]; but if
her father said \[to the messenger\], "Go and receive my daughter's
Get," the husband cannot revoke it. When a husband says,

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Give this Get to
my wife in the place N. N." and the messenger gave it her elsewhere, the
Get is void. \[But if the husband had only said\] "My wife is in the
place N. N." and the messenger gave it her in another place, it is
valid. When a woman says, "Receive for me my Get in such a place," and
the messenger received it for her in another place, it is void; but R.
Eleazar declares it valid. If she said, "Bring me my Get from such a
place," and he fetched it from elsewhere, it is valid.

§ 4. When a wife says, "Bring me my Get," she may \[if married to a
priest\] continue to eat heave till the Get has been delivered into her
hands. When she said to a messenger, "Receive my Get for me," she may
not, from that instant, eat any longer of the heave. If she said,
"Receive my Get for me, and bring it to the place N. N." she is
permitted to eat heave till the time the Get can have reached that
place; but R. Eleazar prohibits it immediately. <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[3](#fn_1041.md)

§ 5. When a husband says, "Write a Get, and give it to my wife," or,
"Divorce her," or, "Write a letter \[‏אגרת‎\] and give it her," they are
to write the Get, and give it her. If he said, "Release her," or,
"Provide her her maintenance," or, "Do with her as is customary," or,
"Do with her as is proper," what he has said amounts to nothing.
Formerly, it was held that when a criminal was led out with an iron
collar \[to the place of execution\], and he said, "Write a Get for my
wife," they should write it, and deliver it to her. It was afterwards
decided, also those that are about going to sea, or to travel with a
caravan \[in the desert\]. R. Simeon Sazuree saith, "Also those who are
dangerously ill."

§ 6. If a person who was cast into a pit, called out from thence, that
whoever should hear his voice should write a Get to his wife, they shall
write it and deliver it to her. When a person in health says, "Write a
Get for my wife," he must be considered as if joking with her. It once
happened that a person in health said, "Write a Get for my wife," and
then went on his roof, from whence he fell and died; Rabbon Simeon ben
Gamaliel saith, "The sages decided upon that occasion, that if he fell
down with premeditation \[on his part\] the Get is valid, but not if the
wind blew him down." <span id="fr_1047"></span>[4](#fn_1042.md)

§ 7. If a husband says to two \[men\], "Give a Get to my wife," <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[5](#fn_1043.md) or to three, "Write a Get, and give it
to my wife," they shall write,

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

and deliver it to her. <span id="fr_1049"></span>[6](#fn_1044.md) If he
said to three, "Give a Get to my wife," the latter can depute others to
write it, because he constituted them a tribunal. Such is the dictum of
R. Meir, and this doctrine R. Hanina of Ono <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[7](#fn_1045.md) brought with him from prison; <span
id="fr_1051"></span>[8](#fn_1046.md) \[he said\] "I have received a
tradition, that when the husband said to three men, 'Give my wife a
Get,' that they may depute others to write it, because the constituted
them a tribunal." R. José saith, "We tell this emissary, <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[9](#fn_1047.md) We \[also\] have a tradition, that
when a husband had said even to the Great Tribunal in Jerusalem, 'Give
my wife a Get,' the latter are bound to study \[the laws of Get\], <span
id="fr_1053"></span>[10](#fn_1048.md) write a Get, and deliver it to the
wife." When a husband says to ten \[men\], "Write ye and deliver a Get
to my wife," one of that number shall write, and two others sign it, but
if he said, "Write it all of ye," then one shall write, and all must
sign it. Therefore, if one of them should die, <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[11](#fn_1049.md) the Get becomes void.
