### CHAPTER VII.

§ 1. The precept concerning the prohibition of eating the "sinew which
shrank" \[‏גיד הנשה‎\] is obligatory in and out of the Holy Land, during
and after the existence of the Temple, in animals slaughtered for
profane use \[‏חולין‎\], and in respect also to consecrated sacrifices,
and applies to wild and domestic animals, and to both the right and left
thighs of the animal; it does not apply to fowl, since these have no
"hollow in the thigh." It applies to a fœtus in embryo, <span
id="fr_1238"></span>[1](#fn_1233) and its suet \[‏חלב‎\] it is permitted
to use. <span id="fr_1239"></span>[2](#fn_1234) According to R. Meir,
"The assertion of butchers in respect to their having removed the ‏גיד
הנשה‎ is not to be relied on;" but the sages hold, "That they may be
relied on in this respect, and in that of the removal of ‏חלב‎, or
suet."

§ 2. It is lawful to send to a non-Israelite a thigh having the ‏גיד
הנשה‎ yet within it, <span id="fr_1240"></span>[3](#fn_1235) because its
existence is easily ascertained. In removing the ‏גיד הנשה‎ the whole
sinew must be carefully cut out. R. Jehudah saith, "It suffices if
enough was removed so as to fulfil the precept." <span
id="fr_1241"></span>[4](#fn_1236)

§ 3. A person who eats the quantity of an olive in size of a ‏גיד הנשה‎,
incurs the penalty of forty stripes. Should a person have eaten the
whole of that sinew, and it was under the mentioned size, he has
nevertheless incurred the same penalty. If a person eat the size of an
olive of the sinews of each hip, eighty stripes are to be inflicted on
him; but according to R. Jehudah, forty stripes only.

§ 4. If a hip was boiled with the ‏גיד הנשה‎ within it, if that sinew
was of sufficient size to impart a flavor to the hip, this latter may
not be used. How is this to be calculated? In the same proportion as
meat boiled with turnips. <span id="fr_1242"></span>[5](#fn_1237)

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

§ 5. When the Guid Anashé was boiled with other sinews, if that sinew
can be recognised \[it must be removed, and\] the other sinews are
prohibited, if it could have imparted a flavor to them. <span
id="fr_1243"></span>[6](#fn_1238) But when it cannot be recognised, all
the sinews are prohibited. The broth \[or liquid in which it is boiled\]
may not be used if the Guid Anashé imparted a flavor to it; <span
id="fr_1244"></span>[7](#fn_1239) and it is even so if a piece of
Nebelah, or of a fish prohibited to be eaten, should have been boiled
with other pieces of meat or fish allowed to be eaten: if the first
mentioned pieces can be recognised, they are to be removed, and if they
could have imparted a flavor to the other pieces, the latter may not be
used. If they could not be recognised, all the pieces are prohibited;
and thus in respect to the broth, which may not be used, if the flavor
of the prohibited pieces could have been imparted to it.

§ 6. The prohibition of the Guid Anashé applies to clean animals, and
not to unclean ones. R. Jehudah saith, "It must be observed also in
respect to unclean animals;" for he argued thus, "The Guid Anashé was
prohibited since the time of the sons of Jacob \[i.e. *before* the
promulgation of the law\], when it was not yet prohibited to use unclean
animals as food." <span id="fr_1245"></span>[8](#fn_1240) The sages
replied, "This precept was first promulgated at Sinai, but it was
written \[incidentally\] in its place." <span
id="fr_1246"></span>[9](#fn_1241)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1233"></span>[343:1](etm157.htm#fr_1238) Found full grown
in the matrix of the dam, and which it was desired to use as food.

<span id="fn_1234"></span>[343:2](etm157.htm#fr_1239) Commentators of
this Mishna differ whether this permission to use the suet applies to
that on the ‏גיד הנשה‎, or to that of the fœtus.

<span id="fn_1235"></span>[343:3](etm157.htm#fr_1240) It need not be
apprehended that he might sell it to an Israelite, who, knowing that it
originally came from an Israelite, might suppose that the sinew had been
removed.

<span id="fn_1236"></span>[343:4](etm157.htm#fr_1241) It suffices to cut
out the upper part, without cutting into the flesh to remove the smaller
filaments.

<span id="fn_1237"></span>[343:5](etm157.htm#fr_1242) That is, the Guid
Anashé must be considered as if it were meat, and the hip <span
id="page_344">p. 344</span> as the same quantity of turnips if the sinew
was of a size that the same quantity of meat would impart a flavour to
the turnips, the hip may not be used. The Halacha is not according to
this Mishna, for it is held that the Guid Anashé cannot communicate any
flavor whatever.

<span id="fn_1238"></span>[344:6](etm157.htm#fr_1243) See the last
sentence of the preceding note.

<span id="fn_1239"></span>[344:7](etm157.htm#fr_1244) That is, if it was
of sufficient size to impart a flavor to the proportion of liquid in
which it was boiled.

<span id="fn_1240"></span>[344:8](etm157.htm#fr_1245) And as there was
thus no distinction between clean and unclean animals, the prohibition
must apply to both kinds.

<span id="fn_1241"></span>[344:9](etm157.htm#fr_1246) Namely, in the
relation of the event of the wrestling of Jacob with the angel (Gen.
xxxii. 33), the *occasion* from which this precept arose is mentioned.
