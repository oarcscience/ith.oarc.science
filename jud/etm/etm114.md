*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER XII.

§ 1. The ceremony of *Chalitzah* must take place before three judges,
who may be laymen. <span id="fr_740"></span>[1](#fn_735.md) If it is
performed with a shoe, <span id="fr_741"></span>[2](#fn_736.md) it is
valid, but not if with a shoe made of felt, or of cloth. The *Chalitzah*
is also valid when it is performed with a sandal which has a leather
strap at the heel, but not if it is not furnished with such a strap. If
it is tied under the knee, it is valid, but not if it was tied above the
knee.

§ 2. If *Chalitzah* was performed with a sandal which does not belong to
the man, or with a wooden sandal \[covered with leather\], or on the
right foot, with a sandal belonging to the left foot, it is valid. If
with a sandal which is too large, but with which the man may walk
nevertheless, or with one too small \[to cover the whole foot\], but
which nevertheless covers the greater part of the foot, the *Chalitzah*
is valid. If that ceremony was performed at night it is valid, but R.
Eleazar declares it void. A *Chalitzah* performed on the left foot is
void, but R. Eleazar declares it to he valid.

§ 3. If the woman took off the shoe, and did expectorate \[before the
brother-in-law\], but did not pronounce the words \[necessary to be
spoken on that occasion\], the *Chalitzah* is valid; if she spoke the
words and expectorated, but did not take off the shoe, the *Chalitzah*
is valid; if she took off the shoe and spoke the words, but did not
expectorate, the *Chalitzah* is void, according to R. Eleazar; but valid
according to R. Akivah. R. Eleazar thus expounds the text (Deut. xxv.
9), "Thus shall it be done," &c. viz. "All acts there prescribed must be
performed, and the omission of any renders the *Chalitzah* void." But R.
Akivah replied, "The same text affords a proof of my opinion, for it is
there stated, 'Thus shall it be done to the man;' which proves that it
only relates to the acts of the man." <span

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

§ 4. When a deaf and dumb man had performed to him the ceremony of
*Chalitzah*, or if a deaf and dumb woman performed it, or when a woman
performed it to a minor, the *Chalitzah* is void. A female who, during
her minority performed a *Chalitzah*, must repeat it on attaining her
majority, otherwise the first *Chalitzah* is void.

§ 5. When a woman gave *Chalitzah* in the presence of two, or even of
three judges, if one of them happens to be related to her, or
incompetent to give evidence, the *Chalitzah* is void: but R. Simeon and
R. Jochanan Hasandelar declare it valid. It happened once that a man
received *Chalitzah* from a woman in a prison, where none but themselves
were present, and when that case was submitted to R. Akivah, he declared
it a valid *Chalitzah*.

§ 6. The due performance of the precept of *Chalitzah* is as
follows:—The man and his sister-in-law shall appear before the tribunal
\[Beth Din\] who are to advise him according to circumstances, for it is
said (Deut. xxv. 8), "The elders of his city shall call him, and speak
unto him," &c., she shall say (Deut. xxv. 7), "My husband's brother
refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not
perform to me the duty of a husband's brother." He shall then say, "I
like not to take her (Deut. xxv. 8)." This was always said in the Holy
language \[Hebrew\], "Then shall the brother's wife come unto him, and
spit out before him;" viz. so that the judges can plainly see her
expectorate. Then shall she answer and say, "So shall it be done with
the man that will not build up his brother's house" (Deut. xxv. 9). Thus
far was it read formerly, but when R. Hyrcanus had the whole
passage <span id="fr_743"></span>[4](#fn_738.md) read under an oak in the
village Atam \[‏עיטם‎\], it became customary ever after to read the
whole section. The injunction of the law (Deut. xxv. 16), "His name
shall be called in Israel the house of him that hath his shoe loosened,"
is obligatory on the judges only, <span id="fr_744"></span>[5](#fn_739.md)
but not on the disciples present; but according to R. Jehudah, it is
incumbent on every one present at the ceremony to call out three times
\[‏חלוץ הנעל‎\], Unshod one! Unshod one! Unshod one!

*Chalitzah* instead of marrying his sister-in-law by *Yeboom*, as
otherwise his domestic felicity may be seriously compromised hereafter,
all which they are to represent to him, and when the match is a suitable
one in point of <span id="page_226">p. 226</span> age, they shall advise
