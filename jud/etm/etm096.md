*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER II.

§ 1. Any one who reads the Meguillah in an irregular manner, does not
acquit himself of his obligation; nor in case he reads it by heart, or
translated in any language he does not understand; but it is lawful to
read it to those who understand foreign languages, <span
id="fr_586"></span>[1](#fn_583.md) in that foreign language. One who speaks
a foreign language, who has it read to him in Hebrew, will be released
from his obligation.

§ 2. Should any person read it so as to make long pauses between the
parts, and slumber meanwhile, he will be released from his obligation.
If any one should read the Meguillah whilst writing, expounding, or
correcting it, with intention of thereby becoming released from his
obligation, he will have fulfilled it, but not if he had no such
intention. If the Meguillah was written with paint, ruddle, gum, vitriol
black, on papyrus, or on rough vellum, the obligation is not properly
fulfilled; but it must be written in Hebrew characters, on good
parchment, and with ink.

§ 3. If an inhabitant of an \[open\] town <span
id="fr_587"></span>[2](#fn_584.md) had gone to an \[anciently\] walled
town, <span id="fr_588"></span>[3](#fn_585.md) or one of \[an anciently\]
walled town had gone to an \[open\] town; if he intend to return \[when
the Meguillah is read\] to his place, he shall read it at the same time
they read it in his place; if not, he shall read it with the inhabitants
of the place in which he then is. From whence is it necessary to have
commenced the reading of the Meguillah, so as to have duly fulfilled the
obligation? R. Meir saith, "It is obligatory to read the whole." R.
Jehudah says, "It suffices if he commenced ‏איש יהודי‎ (Esther ii. 5)."
R. José saith, "\[Even if\] from ‏אחר הדברים האלה‎ (Esther iii)."

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

§ 4. All are qualified to read the Meguillah, with the exception of a
deaf or a foolish person, or a minor; but R. Jehudah allows it to be
said by a minor. The following religious acts may not be done before
sun-rise on the day on which they are obligatory, viz.:—To read the
Meguillah, to circumcise, to bathe \[on the seventh day of the
purification of an unclean or defiled person\], to sprinkle \[the
unclean as a purification\]; nor may a woman \[who had experienced her
menses beyond the usual time, and who was to\] wait a day \[before she
might bathe\] <span id="fr_589"></span>[4](#fn_586.md) do so before the
sun-rise of that day. But if any of these acts have been done at any
period after day-break, they are valid.

§ 5. The following religious acts may be done during the whole of the
day \[on which they are obligatory\], viz.:—The reading of the
Meguillah; of the Hallel; the sounding of the cornet; the use of the
loolab, or palm-branch; the prayer at the additional offering; the
additional offering; the confession of sin on sacrificing the
bulls; <span id="fr_590"></span>[5](#fn_587.md) the confession to be made
on bringing the \[second\] tithe; the confession of sin by the high
priest on the day of atonement; the imposition of hands \[on a
sacrifice\]; the slaughtering of a sacrifice; the waving of the
offering; the bringing it to the altar; the taking of the handful of
flour (Lev. ii. 2); the burning with incense of the fat of a sacrifice
on the altar; the pinching or wringing off the head of fowls brought as
sacrifices (Lev. i. 15); the receiving of the blood of a sacrifice; the
sprinkling thereof on the altar; the giving the bitter waters to drink
to a woman suspected of adultery; the striking off of the heifer's neck
(Deut. xxi. 4); and the purification of a leprous person.

§ 6. The following acts may be done during the whole of the night: the
cutting of the sheaves for the "omer," and the burning with incense of
the fat and members of a burnt-offering on the altar (Lev. vi. 9). This
is the rule:—Whatever is commanded to be done by day, may legally be
done during the whole of the day; and whatever is commanded to be done
by night, it is lawful to do during the whole of the night.
