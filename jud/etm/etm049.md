------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER II.

§ 1. Inclosures \[partitions\] must be made round wells: \[they must be
made of\] four double deal-boards, \[placed at the corners of the well
so that the four deal-boards\] appear like eight. Such is the dictum of
R. Jehudah; but R. Meir saith, "Eight \[deal-boards must be used\],
which appear \[as if there were\] twelve, \[namely\] four double
deal-boards and four single ones; their height must be ten hands, their
width six hands, whatever may be their thickness; \[the interspace\]
between them \[must not be wider\] than to pass two teams of cattle,
each team of three beasts abreast." Such is the dictum of R. Meir; but
R. Jehudah saith, "each team of four beasts abreast," <span
id="fr_187"></span>[1](#fn_187.md) that is to say, of cattle yoked together
in a team,

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

but not walking loose \[unyoked\], so that one enters as the other
passes out.

§ 2. It is permitted to bring the inclosure quite close to the well;
provided always that the head and greater part of the body of a cow
\[animal\] be within \[the inclosure\] while it drinks. It \[the
inclosure\] may \[likewise\] be placed at some distance from the well,
provided that more deal-boards \[be used\].

§ 3. R. Jehudah saith, "\[The greatest distance from the well, at which
it is permitted to place an inclosure is\] two beth saah;" <span
id="fr_188"></span>[2](#fn_188.md) but they \[the sages\] said to him,
"\[The size of\] two beth saah is only applicable to a garden or a
wood-store, but as for a pen \[for cattle\], or a fold, or a drying
\[bleaching\] ground \[behind the house\], or a court \[in front of the
house\], even though it be of the size of five beth kur, <span
id="fr_189"></span>[3](#fn_189.md) yea, even of ten beth kur, it is lawful
\[to carry or move things therein on the day of rest\]." It is
\[therefore\] permitted to place \[the inclosure\] at any convenient
distance \[from the well\], provided that more deal-boards \[be used\].

§ 4. R. Jehudah saith, "If a public thoroughfare interrupts \[passes
through\] the inclosure, it must be closed up \[with boards\], at the
sides \[towards the thoroughfare\]; but the sages hold, it is not
necessary. Whether it be a public cistern, or a public well, or a
private well, \[such an inclosure of\] boards must be made for it; but
to a private cistern, a partition ten hands high is to be made. Such is
the dictum of R. Akivah; but R. Jehudah ben Babah saith, "An inclosure
of deal-boards must be made only for a public well; for all others \[it
is sufficient to\] make a girth \[rope fence\], ten hands high."

§ 5. Moreover, R. Jehudah ben Babah also said, "If a garden or
wood-store be somewhat above seventy amoth square, and is encompassed
\[inclosed\] by a wall ten hands high, it is lawful to move \[carry
things\] therein; provided always that there is a watch-box, or dwelling
\[of some kind within the garden or store\], or that it be close to the
town;" but R. Jehudah saith, "Even though there be nothing \[else\]
within it than a cistern, or a reservoir, or a cave, it is lawful to
move, carry things within it \[the garden or store\]." R. Akivah saith,
"Even though there be not one of all these \[objects\] within \[the
garden or wood-store\], it is lawful to move \[carry things\] therein
\[on the day of rest\], provided it do not measure much above seventy
square amoth." R. Eleazar saith, "If the length \[of such a

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

garden of wood-store\] exceed its width by even a single amah, it is not
permitted to move \[carry things\] therein;" but R. José saith, "Even
though its length be twice its width, it is lawful to move \[carry
things\] therein."

§ 6. R. Elai said, "I heard from R. Eleazar, that even though it \[the
garden or wood-store\] should be an entire beth kur \[in extent\], it is
permitted to move or carry things therein on the day of rest. I also
heard from him, that if one of the householders of a court had
forgotten, and not \[joined in\] the erub, it is unlawful for him to
carry any thing out of, or into, his house; but to them \[the other
inmates of the court\] it is permitted \[so to do\]. Moreover, I heard
from him, that a man might fully acquit himself of his duty <span
id="fr_190"></span>[4](#fn_190.md) on the Passover, by using
‏עקרבנין‎; <span id="fr_191"></span>[5](#fn_191.md) and I inquired among
all his disciples, seeking a companion \[who had likewise heard him
pronounce these opinions\], but I could not find \[meet with one\]."

<span id="fn_187"></span>[73:1](etm049.htm#fr_187.md) The space in width
allowed for an ox is 1⅔ ell; so that, according to the opinion of R.
Meir, the interspace must not exceed 11 ells; while R. Jehudah allows
14⅓ ells.
