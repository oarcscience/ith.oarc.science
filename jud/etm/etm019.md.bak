### CHAPTER VIII.

§ 1. It is prohibited to sow kilaim in a vineyard, to allow it to grow
if it has sprung up spontaneously, or to receive any benefit therefrom.
It is prohibited to sow kilaim of seeds, and to allow it to grow; but it
is lawful to eat of it, and, *à fortiori*, to derive benefit therefrom.
Kilaim of clothing may lawfully be applied to any purpose, except that
of dressing or clothing one's self therewith. It is permitted to rear
kilaim of cattle; but it is unlawful to breed from them; and also to
cause them to copulate with each other, \[as a mule, gotten on a mare by
an ass, with one by a stallion out of a she-ass\].

§ 2. It is prohibited to plough with, to cause to draw, or to drive a
team composed of domestic animals of diverse kinds, or of wild animals
of diverse kinds; or with a team composed of a domestic animal and a
wild one, a wild with a domestic one, an unclean beast with a clean one,
or a clean with an unclean one.

§ 3. Whosoever drives \[a team\] of kilaim shall bear the punishment of
the forty \[stripes\]; and whoever sits in the waggon or carriage is
also liable to the punishment of forty stripes; but R. Meir absolves the
last named \[person\]. It is also prohibited to fasten to a team a third
animal not of the same kind as the other two, \[as an ass to a team of
two oxen\], even though it should not assist in drawing.

§ 4. It is prohibited to tie a horse \[in order to break it in\], to
tine sides of, or behind, a waggon \[drawn by oxen\], and also \[to
tie\], for the purpose of draught, \[a Lybian ass\] <span
id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61.md) with a camel. R. Jehudah saith, "Whatever
is foaled by a mare may be joined with each other, although the sire
should have been an ass; and, in like manner, whatever is foaled by a
she-ass may be joined together, although tine sire should have been a
horse; but it is unlawful to join what has been foaled by a mare with
that which has been foaled by a she-ass."

§ 5. It is prohibited to cause the ‏פרוטיות‎ <span
id="fr_62"></span>[2](#fn_62.md) to copulate; but it is

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

allowed to do so with the ‏רמך‎. <span id="fr_63"></span>[3](#fn_63.md) The
‏אדני שדה‎ <span id="fr_64"></span>[4](#fn_64.md) is a wild animal; R. José
saith, "its dead carcase, even like that of a human being, causes all
that is under the cover of a tent to contract pollution." The porcupine
and the ‏חולדת הסניים‎ <span id="fr_65"></span>[5](#fn_65.md) will, as R.
José says, according to Beth Shammai, "cause a person to contract
pollution who has carried any portion of their carcases, which has the
size of an olive, or who has touched any part of it of the size of a
lentil."

The urus, or buffalo, must be considered as a domestic animal; R. José,
however, saith, "as a wild animal. The dog as a wild animal;" but R.
Meir saith, "as a domestic one." The hog as a domestic animal; the zebra
as a wild animal. The elephant and the monkey as wild animals. It is
lawful for a human being to draw, plough, or drive \[together\] with any
of these animals.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_61"></span>[29:1](etm019.htm#fr_61.md) Heb. ‏לובדקים‎ The
explanation of Maimonides and Bartenora has here been adopted. They
state it to be a kind of ass, greatly exceeding the ordinary size, and
resembling the camel.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[29:2](etm019.htm#fr_62.md) Mules, of which it
cannot be ascertained whether the dam was a mare or a she-ass.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[30:3](etm019.htm#fr_63.md) The term ‏בני הדמכים‎
has, in the English version of Esther, been rendered (viii. 14), "mules
and camels," which cannot be meant here; but the true meaning, and which
fully applies here, appears to be that given by Aben Ezra, in his
Commentaries on Esther, *ad loc. cit.* "Mules foaled by mares, which are
stronger than those foaled by she-asses."

<span id="fn_64"></span>[30:4](etm019.htm#fr_64.md) The description of this
animal, given by various commentators of the Mishna, is, that of an
absolutely fabulous one, which cannot have been meant by the text.
According to Dr. Jost's surmise, "It may be a kind of ape, perhaps an
ouran outang, or Chimpanzee."

<span id="fn_65"></span>[30:5](etm019.htm#fr_65.md) Wild weasel. According
to others, a Chinese weasel; but, according to the opinion of
Maimonides, "a kind of fox or martin."
