<p>&sect; 1. Man may move even four or five kupoth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of straw or grain [to make room] for guests, or to enable disciples to obtain instruction in the law; but [he must] not [move] an entire store. [The following articles] may [likewise] be removed: clean heave-offering,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> doubtful fruit,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> first tithes, of which the heave-offering has been taken, second tithes, and consecrated things which have been redeemed, and dried broad-beans [as these last] are food for the [&#8207;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;&#8206;] poor. [According to another version (&#8207;&#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;&#8206;) goats.] But it is not lawful to move &#8207;&#1496;&#1489;&#1500;&#8206;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> nor first-tithes of which the heave-offering has not been taken; nor second-tithes, nor consecrated things which have not been redeemed; nor yet arum,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> nor mustard. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel permits arum to be moved, as it is food for [tame] ravens.</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. Bundles of straw, bundles of stalks, and bundles of reeds, if intended as fodder for cattle, may be moved; if not, they must not be moved. A basket may be set on end for chickens to climb up and down on; a runaway hen may be chased back [home] again; calves and young asses may be walked [to and fro to take exercise] in the public reshuth; a woman may also walk her child. R. Jehudah saith, "When [may she do this]? If it [the child] lift up one [leg] as it sets the other down; but if it trails [its leg behind] it is prohibited [for the mother] to walk [lead] her child, [on the Sabbath]."</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. A man must not deliver [of its young] an animal that calves on the festival; but he may [otherwise] support [assist] it. [If] a woman is to be delivered on the Sabbath, the midwife must be called in to her from one place to another. The Sabbath may be violated for her sake; the navel-string is to be tied; R. Jos&eacute; saith, "it may also be cut." Whatever is necessary for [appertains to] circumcision, may be done on the Sabbath.</p>
