*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. The Meguillah <span id="fr_564"></span>[1](#fn_561.md) is read
\[sometimes\] on the 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, or on the 15th \[of the
month Adar\], neither earlier nor later. Cities which, from the time of
Joshua, the son of Nun, were surrounded with walls, read it on the
15th. <span id="fr_565"></span>[2](#fn_562.md) Villages and large \[open\]
towns <span id="fr_566"></span>[3](#fn_563.md) shall read it on the 14th,
but inhabitants of villages may read it in advance on the day of
assembly. <span id="fr_567"></span>[4](#fn_564.md)

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

§ 2. How is this \[to be understood\]? When the 14th happens on Monday,
inhabitants of villages and of large \[open\] towns shall read it on
that day, and those of walled cities on the day following. When it
happens on Tuesday or Wednesday, the inhabitants of villages shall read
it in advance on \[the preceding Monday\] the day of assembly, those of
large \[open\] towns on that day \[viz. on the 14th\] and those of
walled towns on the day following. <span id="fr_568"></span>[5](#fn_565.md)
When it happens on Thursday, inhabitants of villages and of large
\[open\] towns shall read it on that day, and those of walled towns on
the day following. If it happen on Friday, the inhabitants of villages
shall read it in advance on \[the preceding day\] the day of assembly,
and those of large \[open\], and of walled towns, on that day \[viz. on
the 14th\]. When it happens on the Sabbath, inhabitants of villages and
of large \[open\] towns shall read it in advance on \[the preceding
Thursday,\] the day of assembly, and those of walled towns on the day
following \[the Sabbath\]. <span id="fr_569"></span>[6](#fn_566.md) When it
happens on Sunday, inhabitants of villages shall read it on \[the
preceding Thursday\] the day of assembly, and those of large \[open\]
towns on that day \[i.e. on the 14th\], and those of walled cities on
the day following.

§ 3. What must be considered as a large \[open\] town? Any town in which
there are ten unemployed men. <span id="fr_570"></span>[7](#fn_567.md)
Should there be less than that number, it is \[legally\] considered as a
village. It was said with respect to these, that "it may be done sooner,
but not later," but the time of the delivery of wood for the
priests, <span id="fr_571"></span>[8](#fn_568.md) the fast on the 9th of
Ab, the festive sacrifice, and the day of assembly \[of the
people\], <span id="fr_572"></span>[9](#fn_569.md) are to be postponed to a
later day, but must not be kept before \[their proper time\] and
although it was said \[in respect to the reading of the Meguillah\] that
it may be done earlier, but not later, it is yet permitted on these days
to pronounce funeral orations, <span id="fr_573"></span>[10](#fn_570.md)
and to fast on them; also to give the alms \[obligatory to be given\] to
the poor

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[on Pureem\]. R.
Jehudah says, "When \[is it allowed to read the Meguillah before its
proper time\]? In places where it is customary \[for the country
people\] to assemble \[in the towns\] on Mondays and Thursdays; but
where that does not take place, it \[the Meguillah\] may only be read on
its proper day."

§ 4. If the Meguillah had been read in the 1st Adar, and the year
declared \[by the Sanhedrin\] to be intercalary, it must be again read
in the 2nd Adar. There is no difference between the ‏פורים‎ of the 1st
Adar, and that in the 2nd, but the reading of the Meguillah and the
gifts to the poor \[which are obligatory on the 2nd\].

§ 5. There is no difference between the Sabbath and festivals, except
the preparation of food. <span id="fr_574"></span>[11](#fn_571.md) There is
no difference between the Sabbath and the day of atonement, excepting
that those who knowingly and wilfully profane the Sabbath are punished
by man, whilst those who wilfully profane the day of atonement are
punished \[by God\] by utter excision.

§ 6. There is no difference between one who by vow has interdicted
himself from receiving any benefit from another, and one whose vow was
limited to the interdiction of accepting any food from another, except
that it is not lawful for the first to set his foot in the house \[or
property\] of the other, and to borrow vessels \[of the other\] which
are not used for the preparation of food. There is no difference between
vows and freewill-offerings, except that in the case of the first
mentioned, the person who thus vows is liable for the risk, <span
id="fr_575"></span>[12](#fn_572.md) but he is not liable for the last
mentioned.

§ 7. There is no difference between a person labouring under an
\[involuntary\] emission \[of semen\] who has experienced it twice \[on
the same day, or on two following days\], and one who has experienced it
thrice \[in the same time, or within three days\], excepting that the
last mentioned must bring a sacrifice. There is no difference between a
leprous person who has only been shut up, <span
id="fr_576"></span>[13](#fn_573.md) and one \[whom the priest has\]
declared as leprous, excepting that the latter must go with rent
clothes, and suffer the hair of his head to grow wild. <span
id="fr_577"></span>[14](#fn_574.md) There is no difference between the
leper declared clean after being shut up, and one who has been cured of
that disease, excepting that the latter must be shaved, and bring
offerings of birds.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

§ 8. There is no difference between the \[Holy\] books <span
id="fr_578"></span>[15](#fn_575.md) and Tephilin \[Phylacteries\] and
Mezuzzoth \[scrolls placed on the door posts (Deut. vi. 8, 9)\], except
that the first mentioned may be written in any language, but the latter
in Hebrew <span id="fr_579"></span>[16](#fn_576.md) only. Rabbon Simeon ben
Gamaliel says, "The permission to write the \[Holy\] books \[in another
language\] was limited to the Greek language only."

§ 9. There is no difference between a high priest anointed with the
sacred oil, and one whose dignity was marked by additional
\[sacerdotal\] vestments only, <span id="fr_580"></span>[17](#fn_577.md)
except the bull which the first mentioned is to offer, in case he gave a
wrong decision, which led to a transgression of a precept <span
id="fr_581"></span>[18](#fn_578.md) \[of the law\]. There is no difference
between an officiating high priest and his late substitute, <span
id="fr_582"></span>[19](#fn_579.md) except the bull offered on the day of
atonement, and the tenth of the ephah \[of flour\] \[which the first
mentioned, or real high priest, alone might offer\].

§ 10. There is no difference between a large high place and a small
one, <span id="fr_583"></span>[20](#fn_580.md) except the paschal
offering. <span id="fr_584"></span>[21](#fn_581.md) This is the rule:—All
offerings which are brought in consequence of vows, and all
peace-offerings, may be offered on a small high place, but not
sacrifices of any other kind.

§ 11. There was no difference between \[the tabernacle at\] Shiloh and
\[the temple at\] Jerusalem, except that at the former place it was
lawful to eat of sacrifices having a minor degree of holiness, and of

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

the second tithe, in any place from whence \[Shiloh\] might be seen; but
in Jerusalem it was lawful to eat these within the walls only. In both
places, however, sacrifices which were most holy <span
id="fr_585"></span>[22](#fn_582.md) might only be eaten within the hangings
\[of the court of the sanctuary\]. The holiness of Shiloh had
\[subsequently\] a period in which it became lawful \[to offer
sacrifices elsewhere\]; but the holiness of Jerusalem has no such
period.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_561"></span>[180:1](etm095.htm#fr_564.md) We retain this
Hebrew word \[which has been already explained above\] in order to avoid
tedious circumlocutions.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[180:2](etm095.htm#fr_565.md) This was thus
ordered, to honour the Holy Land, that they should, even as in Shushan,
read the Meguillah on the 15th of Adar.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[180:3](etm095.htm#fr_566.md) Under this term, all
open places larger than villages, and all towns not walled in, during
the time of Joshua, are here to be understood.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[180:4](etm095.htm#fr_567.md) Namely, on Mondays
or on Thursdays, for on these days the country people came to town to
attend the markets, or the synagogues in which the law is read on these
days, or the tribunals of justice, if they had any lawsuit, as the Beth
Din sate on these two days.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[181:5](etm095.htm#fr_568.md) This, as well as the
preceding part, refers to the time when messengers were sent out to
announce the day of the new moon, on the evidence of witnesses who had
seen it, as mentioned in Treatise Rosh Hashanah; but, according to our
present calendar, the 14th of Adar \[i.e. ‏פורים‎\] can never now happen
on Monday, Wednesday, or Saturday.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[181:6](etm095.htm#fr_569.md) On Sunday.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[181:7](etm095.htm#fr_570.md) Under this term are
designated certain men hired by a Jewish congregation to *abstain* from
work during the hours of prayer in the synagogues, and to attend there
at these times, so that there may always be the legal number
\[*minyan*\] present during the prayers.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[181:8](etm095.htm#fr_571.md) See Treatise
Taanith, chap. iv. § 5.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[181:9](etm095.htm#fr_572.md) See Deuteronomy.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[181:10](etm095.htm#fr_573.md) As mourning over,
and in praise of, an eminent deceased person.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[182:11](etm095.htm#fr_574.md) Which is allowed on
the latter, but not on the Sabbath.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[182:12](etm095.htm#fr_575.md) In case the animal
he has vowed to offer should be stolen, have strayed, or otherwise been
lost, he will be bound to replace it by another.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[182:13](etm095.htm#fr_576.md) Levit. xiii. 4, &c.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[182:14](etm095.htm#fr_577.md) Levit. xiii. 45.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[183:15](etm095.htm#fr_578.md) Under this term are
comprised all the books of the sacred Scriptures, the Pentateuch
excepted.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[183:16](etm095.htm#fr_579.md) This is rendered
according to the commentary of Rashi. The expression in the original is
‏אשורית‎ \[Assyrian\], but Rashi derives it from the root ‏אשר‎,
"happiness," and applies it as a title given to the Hebrew writing or
character *quasi* a happy or beautiful style of writing.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[183:17](etm095.htm#fr_580.md) This was the case
during the latter part of the first, and the whole period of the
existence of the second Temple, when high priests were no longer
consecrated to their high ministration, by being anointed with the
sacred oil.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[183:18](etm095.htm#fr_581.md) See Leviticus iv.
3, and the Commentaries.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[183:19](etm095.htm#fr_582.md) In the original
‏כהן משמש‎, and ‏כהן שעבר‎, by the first designation the actual high
priest is understood, who, owing to circumstances which rendered it
unlawful for him to minister, had returned to his ministration on the
cessation of the impediment. The second expression is applied to the
priest who, in the interim, had acted as his substitute.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[183:20](etm095.htm#fr_583.md) High places are the
altars on which they used to sacrifice before the erection of the Temple
at Jerusalem: by large high places, the public altar; and by small high
places, the altars of private persons are meant (See Judges and Samuel,
*passim*).

<span id="fn_581"></span>[183:21](etm095.htm#fr_584.md) And other
offerings, for which a particular time is prescribed.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[184:22](etm095.htm#fr_585.md) See Treatise
Zebachim.
