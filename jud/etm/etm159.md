### CHAPTER IX.

§ 1. The skin \[of a slaughtered animal\], <span
id="fr_1258"></span>[1](#fn_1253.md) the broth, the meat dissolved by
boiling, that which adheres to the bottom of a saucepan, <span
id="fr_1259"></span>[2](#fn_1254.md) the fragments of meat adhering to the
skin <span id="fr_1260"></span>[3](#fn_1255.md) when it is removed from the
animal, bones \[containing marrow\], sinews, horns and hoofs, are
computed together to form \[with the edible matter or flesh in them\]
the quantity of the size of an egg, when they are liable to contract and
communicate pollution to other edibles, but not the pollution of
Nebelah. Thus also, if a person slaughters an unclean animal for a
heathen, it pollutes edibles while it struggles, but it does not
communicate the pollution of a dead body till life is extinct, or, if
its head had been quite chopped off. There are consequently more cases
in which edibles contract pollution than there are in respect to
pollution by Nebelah. R. Jehudah saith, in reference to the fragments of
meat adhering to the skin, "If any of these, when computed together, are
of the size of an olive in any one place, guilt is thereby
incurred." <span id="fr_1261"></span>[4](#fn_1256.md)

§ 2. In the following instances the skin is to be considered as
flesh:—human skin, that of the domestic swine, <span
id="fr_1262"></span>[5](#fn_1257.md) and, according to R. José, also that
of wild swine, the tender skin on the hump of a young camel, <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[6](#fn_1258.md) and that of the head of a young calf,
the skin \[between\] the split hoofs, that over the matrix, and that of
an animal fœtus in embryo, also that under the tail, and those of the
ferret, the chameleon, the lizard, and the snail. R. Jehudah saith,
"That of a lizard must be considered like a weasel\[’s skin\]." <span
id="fr_1264"></span>[7](#fn_1259.md) If any of these had been tanned or
converted into leather, or that they had been sufficiently trodden \[in
the process of converting the skin into leather\], they are clean,
excepting human skin. R. Jochanan ben Nouri saith, "The eight creeping
things have skins." <span id="fr_1265"></span>[8](#fn_1260.md)

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

§ 3. When a person removes the skin of a domestic or wild animal,
whether clean or unclean, <span id="fr_1266"></span>[9](#fn_1261.md) large
or small, in order to cover himself therewith, <span
id="fr_1267"></span>[10](#fn_1262.md) pollution is contracted and
communicated when as much skin is removed as can be taken hold of, <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[11](#fn_1263.md) and if to make a bottle of
skin, <span id="fr_1269"></span>[12](#fn_1264.md) until the skin over the
breast is removed. <span id="fr_1270"></span>[13](#fn_1265.md) If the
skinning was commenced from the legs, the whole is considered as
connecting, and subject to contract and communicate pollution. The skin
covering the neck is not considered as connecting by R. Jochanan ben
Nouri, but the sages do so consider it until the whole skin is removed.

§ 4. When there is the size of an olive of flesh on a skin in one spot,
any person who-touches the filaments proceeding therefrom, or the hairs
on the skin which are opposite \[and touch the said flesh\], is unclean.
If there were two pieces of flesh of the size of two half olives each,
it pollutes by being carried, but not by the mere touching it. Such is
the dictum of R. Ishmael, but R. Akivah holds "That they do not pollute
either by being carried or touched," but he admits, "That if the size of
two half olives were stuck on a skewer and moved, it is unclean." Why,
then, does \[R. Akivah\], in respect to the skin, hold it to be clean?
Because the skin prevents their contact.

§ 5. Whoever touches a marrow-bone of a dead body, <span
id="fr_1271"></span>[14](#fn_1266.md) or of a consecrated sacrifice, <span
id="fr_1272"></span>[15](#fn_1267.md) whether the said bones are open or
closed, is unclean. Whoever touches a marrow-bone of an animal that is
Nebelah, or of creeping animals, is clean when the bone is closed, but
if it is open ever so little, pollution is contracted by contact with
it. Whence is it proved that \[the marrow-bone of a Nebelah\] does also
pollute the person carrying it? Because it is said \[Lev. xi. 24, 25\],
"Whoever toucheth \[the carcase\]," and "Whoever beareth aught of the
carcase," &c., which proves that whatever communicates by

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

being touched, does also communicate it by being carried, and that which
cannot communicate pollution by contact, cannot communicate it by being
carried.

§ 6. The egg of a creeping animal, in which the young animal is already
developed, is clean, but when it has the smallest perforation it renders
unclean. In respect to a mouse which is yet half flesh and half
earth, <span id="fr_1273"></span>[16](#fn_1268.md) if the flesh is touched
it renders unclean, but not if only the earth thereof had been touched.
R. Jehudah saith, "Whoever touches the earth which immediately adjoins
the fleshy part is also unclean."

§ 7. Members, <span id="fr_1274"></span>[17](#fn_1269.md) or pieces of
flesh which had been forcibly torn off a \[live\] animal, <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[18](#fn_1270.md) but which are yet pendant to it, are
subject to contract and communicate pollution like other edibles, while
they remain thus pendant in their place, <span
id="fr_1276"></span>[19](#fn_1271.md) but require the susceptibility of
contracting pollution to be communicated to them, <span
id="fr_1277"></span>[20](#fn_1272.md) before they contract it. When the
animal was slaughtered they may contract pollution by its blood,
according to R. Meir, but R. Simeon saith, "They do not thereby contract
it." When the animal dies of itself, it requires the susceptibility of
contracting pollution to be communicated to it before it is
unclean. <span id="fr_1278"></span>[21](#fn_1273.md) The \[pendulous\]
member does, however, pollute as a member taken off an animal while yet
alive, but not as Nebelah. Such is the dictum of R. Meir; but R. Simeon
saith, "That member or the pieces of flesh \[above mentioned\] are
clean."

§ 8. A limb or piece of flesh torn from a human body, but yet pendant to
it, is clean \[if the person is alive\], <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[22](#fn_1274.md) but should he die, the flesh is
clean, but the limb pollutes as a limb severed from a living being, but
not as a part of a dead body. Such is the dictum of R. Mein; but R.
Simeon holds the said limb to be clean.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1253"></span>[347:1](etm159.htm#fr_1258.md) Containing a piece
of meat of less size than that of an egg.

<span id="fn_1254"></span>[347:2](etm159.htm#fr_1259.md) Or, as Maimonides
explains the original expression, ‏קייפה‎, the spice put in to render
the meat palatable.

<span id="fn_1255"></span>[347:3](etm159.htm#fr_1260.md) The original word
‏אלל‎, is variously explained. (See ‏זבחים‎, chap. III. § 4, and the
Commentary of Bartenora.) The rendering we have given is corroborated by
the end of this Mishna, and appears the most plausible.

<span id="fn_1256"></span>[347:4](etm159.htm#fr_1261.md) Pollution is
communicated by Nebelah when of the size of an olive only.

<span id="fn_1257"></span>[347:5](etm159.htm#fr_1262.md) Because it is soft
and edible.

<span id="fn_1258"></span>[347:6](etm159.htm#fr_1263.md) Which has not yet
carried any burden.

<span id="fn_1259"></span>[347:7](etm159.htm#fr_1264.md) Whose skin does
not contract pollution.

<span id="fn_1260"></span>[347:8](etm159.htm#fr_1265.md) And their skin,
not being deemed the same as their flesh, does not contract pollution,
even as that of the weasel.

<span id="fn_1261"></span>[348:9](etm159.htm#fr_1266.md) That is, whether
the animal and he that skins it is clean, or that the animal is unclean,
and he that skins it is clean.

<span id="fn_1262"></span>[348:10](etm159.htm#fr_1267.md) Or, to spread it
over a bed or table.

<span id="fn_1263"></span>[348:11](etm159.htm#fr_1268.md) Viz., two
handbreaths.

<span id="fn_1264"></span>[348:12](etm159.htm#fr_1269.md) For this purpose
the skin is not cut open the whole length of the animal, but is cut
round, from the neck to the tail, so as to form a bag, which in eastern
countries is used to put liquids in.

<span id="fn_1265"></span>[348:13](etm159.htm#fr_1270.md) Because the
breast is the most difficult part of the operation.

<span id="fn_1266"></span>[348:14](etm159.htm#fr_1271.md) When a person
touches or carries any part of a dead body, should it even be so small
as a grain, he contracts pollution in consequence.

<span id="fn_1267"></span>[348:15](etm159.htm#fr_1272.md) Which remained
after the third day \[‏פיגול‎ and ‏נותר‎\]. These render the person who
touches them unclean. (See Treatise Yadaim.)

<span id="fn_1268"></span>[349:16](etm159.htm#fr_1273.md) It was anciently
supposed that some species of mice were produced on dunghills, &c., from
the soil, so that one part of the body was animated before the other.

<span id="fn_1269"></span>[349:17](etm159.htm#fr_1274.md) That is, pieces
consisting of flesh, bone, and sinews, are thus called.

<span id="fn_1270"></span>[349:18](etm159.htm#fr_1275.md) In a manner that
it will never heal nor grow again.

<span id="fn_1271"></span>[349:19](etm159.htm#fr_1276.md) That is, it is
not unclean of itself, as Nebelah, but it can contract pollution by
coming in contact with a ‏שרץ‎, or creeping animal.

<span id="fn_1272"></span>[349:20](etm159.htm#fr_1277.md) By being
moistened.

<span id="fn_1273"></span>[349:21](etm159.htm#fr_1278.md) Because, as it
was torn off while the animal was alive, it cannot be considered as
Nebelah.

<span id="fn_1274"></span>[349:22](etm159.htm#fr_1279.md) Because the
expression of the text is, "When a man *dieth* within a tent," &c.
(Numbers xix. 15.)
