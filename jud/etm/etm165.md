*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. A quarter lug of water is poured on \[the hands of\] one person,
also on \[the hands of\] two <span id="fr_1296"></span>[4](#fn_1291)
\[persons\], half a lug on three or four, a whole lug and upwards on
five, or ten, or even one hundred \[persons\]. <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[5](#fn_1292) R. José saith, "Provided always, there
be not less for the last \[person using the water\] than a quarter \[of
a lug\]." They

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

may add <span id="fr_1298"></span>[6](#fn_1293) \[water\] for the second
\[ablution\], but they must not add \[any\] for the first.

§ 2. From all \[kinds of\] vessels they may pour on the hands, even from
vessels \[made\] of cow-dung, or vessels of stone, or of earth. But they
must not pour \[water\] on the hands out of the sides \[fragments\] of a
vessel, or the bottom of a tub, or the bung of a cask: nor \[must a
man\] give to his neighbour \[water\] out of the hollow of his \[own\]
hand, because they must not draw, or consecrate, or sprinkle the water
of purification, <span id="fr_1299"></span>[7](#fn_1294) or pour
\[water\] on the hands, except \[it be\] in a vessel. \[In cases of
uncleanness arising from the tent\] <span
id="fr_1300"></span>[8](#fn_1295) they cannot preserve \[therefrom\], by
means of a close cover, \[any utensils\] except \[whole\] vessels
\[only\]; nor can they preserve \[the contents of\] an earthen vessel,
\[into which a dead reptile has fallen, from contracting uncleanness\],
except \[closed\] utensils \[only\]. <span
id="fr_1301"></span>[9](#fn_1296)

§ 3. Water which \[on account of its bad smell\] is unfit for
\[domestic\] animals to drink, is unfit \[for ablution, if contained\]
in \[any kind of\] vessels; but on the ground \[in a ditch\], it is fit
\[for ablution, by immersing the hands therein\]. Should ink, gum, or
vitriol black drop into it \[the water\], so that its colour be changed,
it becomes unfit \[for ablution\]. If it has been used for any purpose,
or he \[a man\] has soaked his bread therein, it \[the water\] becomes
unfit \[for ablution\]. Simeon, the Temanite, said, "\[What!\] even
though he intended to soak something in one vessel and it dropped into
another? \[No\] it continues fit \[for ablution\]."

§ 4. Has he rinsed vessels therein \[the water\], or \[used it\] to
rinse out measures, it becomes unfit; but if he rinsed therein vessels
which already had been rinsed \[clean\], or new ones, \[the water so
used\] continues fit \[for ablution\]. R. José prohibits it\[s use\] in
\[the case of\] new vessels.

§ 5. Water in which the baker has dipped rolls is unfit \[for
ablution\], but has he only dipped his hands therein it continues fit.
All are qualified to pour water on \[other persons’\] hands, even the
deaf and dumb, idiot or minor. A man may hold a cask between his knees
to pour the water \[over his hands\]. An ape may pour water

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

on \[a person's\] hands. R. José declares these two \[last-mentioned
modes of pouring water on the hands as legally\] improper.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1291"></span>[357:4](etm165.htm#fr_1296) This, according to
Maimonides, only applied to second ablutions.

<span id="fn_1292"></span>[357:5](etm165.htm#fr_1297) This hyperbole is
used to express any indefinite number.

<span id="fn_1293"></span>[358:6](etm165.htm#fr_1298) Should the vessel
not contain water sufficient for a proper ablution.

<span id="fn_1294"></span>[358:7](etm165.htm#fr_1299) Vide Numbers xix.
13, and Treatise Parah \[the red heifer\].

<span id="fn_1295"></span>[358:8](etm165.htm#fr_1300) Vide Numbers xix.
14, and Treatise Oholoth \[of tents\].

<span id="fn_1296"></span>[358:9](etm165.htm#fr_1301) Food or beverage
of any kind, contained in a vessel into which a dead reptile has fallen,
becomes unclean; but close vessels which may be therein contained do not
become unclean.
