### CHAPTER V.

§ 1. The prohibition against slaughtering an animal and its young on the
same day \[Lev. xxii. 28\], is obligatory in the Holy Land, and out of
it, during and after the existence of the Temple, with respect to
animals slaughtered for profane use \[i.e. to eat them\], and to those
slaughtered as consecrated sacrifices, as follows. When a person
slaughtered an animal and its young \[on the same day\] without the
temple-court \[not as holy sacrifices, but\] as animals slaughtered for
profane use though both animals are Cashér, yet in slaughtering the
second, he incurred the penalty of the forty stripes. <span
id="fr_1226"></span>[1](#fn_1221.md) Should he have slaughtered them
outside the temple-court as holy sacrifices, he has incurred the penalty
of utter excision \[‏כרת‎\] for the slaughter of the first. Both animals
are Pasool, and he has moreover incurred the penalty of forty stripes
for the slaughtering of each animal. Should he have slaughtered them as
‏חולין‎ \[i.e. for profane or ordinary use\] within the temple-court,
both animals are Pasool; and for the slaughter of the second, he
incurred the penalty of forty stripes. If both were consecrated
sacrifices, and were slaughtered within the temple-court, the animal
first slaughtered is a valid sacrifice, and the person who slaughtered
it has not incurred any penalty for so doing; but he incurred the
penalty of the forty stripes for the slaughter of the second animal, and
that animal is unfit for sacrifice.

§ 2. If the animal first slaughtered was ‏חולין‎, and the other a
consecrated sacrifice, and they were slaughtered outside the
temple-court, the first animal is Cashér, and the person who slaughtered
it has not incurred any penalty; but for the slaughter of the second he
incurred that of the forty stripes, and the animal is an unfit
sacrifice. If the first animal was consecrated, and the second ‏חולין‎,
and both were slaughtered outside the temple-court, he who slaughtered
the

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

first incurred the penalty of utter excision, and the animal is an unfit
sacrifice; the second animal is Cashér, and for the slaughtering of
each, the penalty of the forty stripes has been incurred. If the first
animal was ‏חולין‎, and the second a consecrated sacrifice, and they
were slaughtered inside the temple-court, both are Pasool; and for the
slaughter of the second, the penalty of forty stripes has been incurred.
If the first animal was consecrated, and the second ‏חולין‎, and they
were slaughtered within the temple-court, the first animal is Cashér,
and the person who slaughtered it has not incurred any penalty but that
of the forty stripes for the slaughter of the second, and that animal is
Pasool. If both animals were ‏חולין‎, and one of them was slaughtered
outside, and the second inside the temple-court, the first animal is
Cashér, and he who slaughtered it has not incurred any penalty but that
of the forty stripes for the slaughter of the second, and that animal is
Pasool. If both animals were consecrated sacrifices, and one of them was
slaughtered outside, and the second inside the temple-court, the person
who slaughtered them has incurred the penalty of excision for the
slaughter of the first \[both animals are Pasool\], and that of the
forty stripes for the slaughter of each. If both animals were ‏חולין‎,
and one of them was slaughtered within, and the second without the
temple-court, the first animal is Pasool, and he who slaughtered them
has not incurred any penalty but that of the forty stripes for the
slaughter of the second, but that animal is Cashér. If both were
consecrated animals, and one of them was slaughtered inside, and the
other outside of the temple-court, the first animal is Cashér, and the
person who slaughtered it has not incurred any penalty but that of the
forty stripes for the slaughter of the second, and that animal is an
unfit sacrifice.

§ 3. When one of the animals was found to be Terefá, or that one had
been slaughtered for idolaters, or that one is a cow of a sin-offering,
or an ox condemned to lapidation, <span
id="fr_1227"></span>[2](#fn_1222.md) or a calf whose neck was to be struck
off, <span id="fr_1228"></span>[3](#fn_1223.md) R. Simeon absolves \[the
person who slaughtered the second animal on the same day\] from any
penalty; but the sages hold "That he incurred that \[of the forty
stripes\]." <span id="fr_1229"></span>[4](#fn_1224.md) When one of the
animals becomes Nebelah by being improperly slaughtered; or when it was
killed by a knife being thrust up its nostrils; or that the trachea and
œsophagus were forcibly torn off, the law against slaughtering an animal
and its young on the same day is not

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

applicable: When a cow and its calf were bought by two persons, one
buying the cow and the other the calf, the first buyer has a right to
slaughter his purchase first; but if the other buyer anticipated him in
slaughtering his, he has acquired his right. <span
id="fr_1230"></span>[5](#fn_1225.md) Should a person have slaughtered a cow
and her two calves on the same day, he has incurred a penalty of eighty
stripes; but if he slaughtered the two calves first, and then the cow,
he has only incurred \[one\] penalty of forty stripes. If he slaughtered
\[on the same day\] a cow and its young, and the calf of that young cow,
eighty stripes shall be inflicted on him. If he slaughtered \[on the
same day\] a cow, then the calf of its young, and lastly the young
itself, the forty stripes shall be inflicted on him. Symmachus, <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[6](#fn_1226.md) in the name of R. Meir, saith, "eighty
\[stripes\]." At four periods of the year a seller of cattle is bound to
inform the buyer that he had sold the dam or leer young on the same day
for the purpose of being slaughtered, viz. on the day preceding the last
day of the Feast of Tabernacles, on those preceding the first day of
Passover, the Feast of Weeks, and of the New Year; and according to R.
José the Galilean, also on the day preceding the Day of Atonement in
Galilee. R. Jehudah saith, "When is he bound to give that information?
Only if there should not be a day's interval between the sale of one of
the animals and that of the other; but if there was such an interval,
the mentioned information is not required from the seller." Yet R.
Jehudah admits, "That in case he sold the dam to a bridegroom, and the
young to his bride, he is bound to inform them thereof, because it is to
be supposed that both animals will be slaughtered on the same day."

§ 4. On the mentioned four periods \[or days\], a butcher can be
compelled to slaughter cattle against his will. <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[7](#fn_1227.md) Even if he had an ox worth a thousand
dinars, and there was a purchaser for only a single dinars worth of
meat, he will be compelled to slaughter it. Hence, should the animal die
meanwhile \[naturally\], the loss <span
id="fr_1233"></span>[8](#fn_1228.md) falls on the purchaser; but it is not
so at other times, for when the animal then dies of itself, the loss
falls on the seller \[or butcher\].

§ 5. The expression of the law, "One day," when treating of the
prohibition of slaughtering an animal and its young in one \[and the
same\] day, is to be understood, that the day and the night which

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

preceded it are to be reckoned together \[as forming one day\]. For thus
was it expounded by R. Simeon ben Zomah, "The term 'one day' is used in
the History of the Cosmogony, and also in the precept relative to the
prohibition of slaughtering an animal and its young \[on the same day\],
to teach us, that even as in the first instance, the night and the day
which followed it made 'one day,' <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[9](#fn_1229.md) thus also must it be understood in the
second or present instance."
