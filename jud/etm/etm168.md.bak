### CHAPTER IV.

§ 1. On that day <span id="fr_1320"></span>[1](#fn_1315.md) they divided
and decided, <span id="fr_1321"></span>[2](#fn_1316.md) "That a trough used
to wash the feet \[and capable of\] containing from two lug to nine
kab—which has been split \[near the bottom <span
id="fr_1322"></span>[3](#fn_1317.md)\], may become unclean from
pressure," <span id="fr_1323"></span>[4](#fn_1318.md) although R. Akivah
contended that \[such\] a trough always remains like what it is
named. <span id="fr_1324"></span>[5](#fn_1319.md)

§ 2. On the same day they decided, "That all sacrifices which have been
brought under an improper designation, <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[6](#fn_1320.md) are valid, but do not absolve the
owners from their obligation, <span id="fr_1326"></span>[7](#fn_1321.md)
except the paschal sacrifice, and the sin-offering; the paschal
sacrifice in due season, and the sin-offering at all times." R. Eleazar
saith, "The trespass-offering likewise: the paschal sacrifice in its due
season, and the sin or trespass-offering at all times." R. Simeon ben
Azai said, "I have it as a tradition from the mouths of seventy-two
elders, on the day they inducted R. Eleazar ben Azariah into the
president's seat, that all sacrifices \[which may be eaten\] that have
been brought under an improper designation, are valid, but do not
absolve the owners of their obligation, except the paschal sacrifice and
the sin-offering."

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ben Azai only
added the burnt-offering, but the sages did not coincide with him.

§ 3. On the same day they argued: \[The land of\] Ammon and \[of\] Moab,
how are they \[affected\] by the Sabbatical year \[of agrarian rest\]?
R. Tarphon decided, "\[That Israelites residing in those countries must
pay\] tithes for the poor;" but R. Eleazar bell Azariah decided, "\[They
must pay\] second tithes." <span id="fr_1327"></span>[8](#fn_1322.md) R.
Ishmael then said, "Eleazar ben Azariah, it behoves thee to prove thy
assertion, for thou enactest a more rigid observance; and whosoever
enacts a more rigid observance, with him rests the onus of making good
his decision." R. Eleazar ben Azariah replied, "Ishmael, my brother, I
have not deviated from the regular order \[series\] of the years, <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[9](#fn_1323.md) but my brother Tarphon has deviated
therefrom, therefore, the onus probandi rests on him." R. Tarphon
\[then\] replied, "Egypt is out of the land \[of Israel; abroad\], and
Ammon and Moab are out of the land \[of Israel; abroad\]: even as Egypt
\[pays\] tithe for the poor in the Sabbatical year, so Ammon and Moab
\[must likewise pay\] tithe for the poor during the Sabbatical year." R.
Eleazar ben Azariah replied, "Babylon is out of the land \[of Israel;
abroad\], and Ammon and Moab are out of the land \[of Israel\]: even as
Babylon \[pays\] second tithe during the Sabbatical year, so Ammon and
Moab \[must likewise pay\] second tithe during the Sabbatical year." R.
Tarphon \[further\] replied, "Egypt being near \[adjoining to the land
of Israel\], is subjected to tithe for the poor, in order that the poor
in Israel may be thereby supported during the Sabbatical year; so
likewise Ammon and Moab, which are near \[adjoining the land of
Israel\], must also be subjected to tithe for the poor, in order that
the poor in Israel may be thereby supported during the Sabbatical year."
To this R. Eleazar ben Azariah replied, "Thou seekest to increase the
money \[contributed for the poor\], but in truth thou losest souls;
wouldst thou be the cause that heaven should send down neither dew nor
rain, as it is said, 'Shall a man defraud God? Yet ye have defrauded me.
But ye say, In what have we defrauded thee? In

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

tithes and heave-offerings.'" <span id="fr_1329"></span>[10](#fn_1324.md)
R. Joshua then said, "Behold, I will answer for my brother Tarphon,
although not according to his mode of argumentation. \[The regulation
concerning\] Egypt is newly established; \[whereas that concerning\]
Babylon is established of old; the subject before us \[also relates to a
regulation to be\] newly established. Let, therefore, \[one\] new
regulation be subjected to conclusions drawn from \[another\] new
regulation; but let not a new regulation be subjected to conclusions
drawn from an old established regulation. \[Moreover, the regulation
concerning\] Egypt is established by the elders \[of the great
Sanhedrin; whereas the regulation concerning\] Babylon is established by
the prophets \[their predecessors\]; the subject before us \[also
relates to a regulation to be\] established by elders. Let, therefore,
\[one\] regulation established by elders be subjected to conclusions
drawn from \[another\] regulation established by elders, but let not a
regulation by elders be subjected to conclusions drawn from a regulation
by prophets." They \[the sages\] then divided, and \[the majority\]
decided, "That Ammon and Moab must pay tithe for the poor during the
Sabbatical year." When R. José ben Dormiskith came to R. Eleazar \[ben
Hyrcanos\], at Lydda, he \[R. Eleazar\] inquired of him, "What had ye
new in the Beth Medrash \[College\] to-day?" He \[R. José\] replied,
"They divided and decided, that Ammon and Moab must pay tithe for the
poor in the Sabbatical year." \[On hearing this\], R. Eleazar wept, and
exclaimed, "The secrets of the Lord are for those who fear him, and his
covenant to be made known to them; <span
id="fr_1330"></span>[11](#fn_1325.md) go forth and tell them, Ye need be
under no apprehension on account of the decision you have adopted, for I
have it as a tradition from the mouth of Rabbon Jochanan ben Zachai, who
heard it from his teacher, who heard it from his teacher, even up to the
decision of Moses from Sinai, that Ammon and Moab pay tithes to the poor
during the Sabbatical year.'"

§ 4. On that day came Judah, an Ammonitish proselyte, and stood before
them in the Medrash. He said to them \[the sages\], "How

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

am I \[situated with respect\] to coming into the congregation \[of
Israel\]?" <span id="fr_1331"></span>[12](#fn_1326.md) Rabbon Gamaliel
answered him, "Thou art prohibited." R. Joshua answered him, "Thou art
permitted." Rabbon Gamaliel then said, "The Scripture saith, 'An
Ammonite and a Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the
Lord, even to their tenth generation,' and so forth." <span
id="fr_1332"></span>[13](#fn_1327.md) To this R. Joshua replied, "Are then
the Ammonites or Moabites still in their own land? Sennacherib, king of
Assyria, did already long ago march up and intermix the nations, as it
is said, 'I have removed the bounds of the nations, have plundered their
treasures, and laid low the might of the inhabitants.'" <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[14](#fn_1328.md) "\[But\]," said Rabbon Gamaliel to
him, "the Scriptures declare, 'And afterwards I will bring again the
captivity of the children of Ammon,' <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[15](#fn_1329.md) and \[therefore\] they are already
returned." \[To this\] R. Joshua replied, "The Scriptures \[also\]
declare, 'I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel' \[and
Judah\], <span id="fr_1335"></span>[16](#fn_1330.md) but \[nevertheless\]
they are not yet returned;" upon which they \[the sages\] permitted him
\[the Ammonitish proselyte\] to come into the congregation.

§ 5. The Targum \[Chaldee passages\] in Ezra and Daniel makes the hands
unclean. Targum written in Hebrew characters, and Hebrew written in
Targum \[Syriac\] characters or in Hebrew characters, do not make the
hands unclean. In no case do \[sacred Scriptures\] make \[the hands\]
unclean, unless the writing be Assyrian \[square\] characters on
parchment with ink.

§ 6. The Sadducees said, "We blame \[object to\] you Pharisees, because
you say, 'Sacred Scriptures make the hands unclean, but the books
Hameram <span id="fr_1336"></span>[17](#fn_1331.md) do not make the hands
unclean.'" Rabbon Jochanan ben Zachai replied \[ironically\], "And have
we nothing else to object to the Pharisees but this? They also assert
that the bones of an ass are clean, but the bones of Jochanan the high
priest are unclean." They \[the Sadducees\] replied, "According to their
love \[the estimation in which the bones are held\] is their
uncleanness,

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

so that no one may turn the bones of his father and mother into spoons."
He answered them, "In like manner \[are\] the sacred Scriptures;
according to their love \[the high estimation in which they are held\]
is their uncleanness; whereas the books Hameram, which are not beloved
\[held in no esteem\], do not make the hands unclean."

§ 7. The Sadducees said, "We blame \[object to\] you Pharisees, that ye
declare the stream \[which flows when water is poured from a clean
vessel into an unclean one\] to be clean." <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[18](#fn_1332.md) The Pharisees replied \[with much
better right\], "We \[may\] blame \[object to\] you Sadducees, that ye
declare a streamlet of water which flows from a burial ground to be
clean." <span id="fr_1338"></span>[19](#fn_1333.md) The Sadducees
\[further\] said, "We blame \[object to\] you Pharisees, because ye say,
'If mine ox or mine ass cause any damage, I am bound \[to make
compensation\], but should my bondman or bondwoman cause any damage, I
am absolved \[from making compensation\];' if I am bound for mine ox and
mine ass, respecting which there are no duties enjoined on me, \[does it
not follow that\] for my bondman or bondwoman, respecting whom there are
duties enjoined on me, it is just that I should \[also\] be bound \[to
compensate\] for the damage he \[or she\] occasions?" \[But\] they \[the
Pharisees\] replied, "Not the same rule which applies to mine ox or mine
ass, that are not possessed of reason, can apply to my bondman or
bondwoman, who are possessed of reason; for, should I offend them, they
may \[maliciously\] set fire to the growing corn of another person, in
order that I might be bound to pay for it."

§ 8. A Galilean Sadducee said, "I blame \[object to\] you Pharisees,
that you insert the name of the sovereign in the same document \[letter
of divorce\] with Moses." <span id="fr_1339"></span>[20](#fn_1334.md) The
Pharisees replied \[with much better reason\], "We \[might\] blame
\[object to\] thee, Galilean Sadducee, that ye inscribe the \[name of
the\] sovereign with the Holy Name on the same page: and not only that,
but ye inscribe the sovereign first, as it is said, 'And Pharaoh said,

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Who is the Lord
that I should hearken to his voice to let Israel go?'" <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[21](#fn_1335.md) \[But when he was punished, he
exclaimed, "The Lord is righteous."\] <span
id="fr_1341"></span>[22](#fn_1336.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1315"></span>[363:1](etm168.htm#fr_1320.md) The day on which
R. Eleazar ben Azariah was appointed president of the school at Jabneh
(Jamniah).

<span id="fn_1316"></span>[363:2](etm168.htm#fr_1321.md) The ayes and the
noes divided, and the majority decided.

<span id="fn_1317"></span>[363:3](etm168.htm#fr_1322.md) So that it cannot
contain water sufficient to wash one foot at a time, and is, therefore,
no longer a bathing trough.

<span id="fn_1318"></span>[363:4](etm168.htm#fr_1323.md) Should an unclean
person sit thereon.

<span id="fn_1319"></span>[363:5](etm168.htm#fr_1324.md) Though unfit for
use, it still is a trough, and as such, not liable to become unclean
from pressure. (Vide Treatise Kelim, chap. 1. § 2.)

<span id="fn_1320"></span>[363:6](etm168.htm#fr_1325.md) If bound to bring
a sacrifice of one kind, he designates it as a different kind. (Vide
Treatise Sebachim, chap. I. §§ 2, 3.)

<span id="fn_1321"></span>[363:7](etm168.htm#fr_1326.md) He is still bound
to bring his sacrifice.

<span id="fn_1322"></span>[364:8](etm168.htm#fr_1327.md) The tithe for the
poor was Cholin \[common food\], and might be eaten in any place,
whereas the second tithe was consecrated, and could only be eaten in
Jerusalem. (Vide Deut. xiv. 22, and Treatise Maasar Sheni.)

<span id="fn_1323"></span>[364:9](etm168.htm#fr_1328.md) It was an
established rule that the year in which the tithe was paid to the poor,
should be succeeded by a year in which the second tithe was consumed in
Jerusalem; and as the sixth year was fixed for payment of tithe to the
poor, the seventh year, in all countries not subject to the agrarian
rest, entailed the obligation of second tithe.

<span id="fn_1324"></span>[365:10](etm168.htm#fr_1329.md) Malachi iii.
8:—R. Eleazar ben Azariah assumes that the tithe spoken of by the
prophet cannot be tithe for the poor, which is Cholin, or profane; but
that it must be second tithe, because that is consecrated like the
heave, in connexion with which it is mentioned.

<span id="fn_1325"></span>[365:11](etm168.htm#fr_1330.md) Ps. xxv. 14.—Some
explain, that R. Eleazar wept for joy, because they had adopted the
right decision; others will have it that he wept for grief, because they
had forgotten and put to the vote an ‏הלכה למשה מסיגי‎

<span id="fn_1326"></span>[366:12](etm168.htm#fr_1331.md) To marry an
Israelitish woman.

<span id="fn_1327"></span>[366:13](etm168.htm#fr_1332.md) Deut. xxiii. 3.

<span id="fn_1328"></span>[366:14](etm168.htm#fr_1333.md) Isa. x. 13.—The
"removal of bounds" is expressive of the custom to transplant conquered
nations from their own country to some other land.

<span id="fn_1329"></span>[366:15](etm168.htm#fr_1334.md) Jer. xlix. 6.

<span id="fn_1330"></span>[366:16](etm168.htm#fr_1335.md) Amos ix. 14.

<span id="fn_1331"></span>[366:17](etm168.htm#fr_1336.md) ‏ספרי המירם‎
According to Bartenora, from ‏המיר‎, to change, or substitute falsehood
in lieu of truth—books written against revealed religion. Others
consider it to mean the writings of Homer, the Greek poet.

<span id="fn_1332"></span>[367:18](etm168.htm#fr_1337.md) Vide Treatise
Maksheerin, chap. V. § 9.

<span id="fn_1333"></span>[367:19](etm168.htm#fr_1338.md) If a streamlet of
water which flows from so unclean a place as a cemetery, is by the
Sadducees allowed to be clean, surely the water which flows out of a
clean vessel is, with much more reason, to be considered as clean.

<span id="fn_1334"></span>[367:20](etm168.htm#fr_1339.md) In dating the
document, the year of the sovereign's reign is inserted, and the whole
closes with the formula, "According to the Law of Moses and of Israel."
This mention of the sovereign, and the year of his reign, the Sadducee
considers as an insult to Moses.

<span id="fn_1335"></span>[368:21](etm168.htm#fr_1340.md) Exod. v. 2.—The
name of the heathen sovereign cannot be considered as an insult to
Moses, since, in the passage quoted, the name of Pharaoh is coupled with
that of the Lord, and even precedes it.

<span id="fn_1336"></span>[368:22](etm168.htm#fr_1341.md) Exod. ix.
27.—This sentence forms no part of the Pharisee's reply, and has no
connexion with what precedes, but is only introduced that the Treatise
may not conclude with Pharaoh's blasphemy.
