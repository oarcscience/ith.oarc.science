### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. There are four periods of commencement of years: viz.—on the first
of Nissan is a new year for \[the computation of the reign of\]
kings, <span id="fr_462"></span>[1](#fn_461.md) and for festivals; <span
id="fr_463"></span>[2](#fn_462.md) the first of Elul is a new year for the
tithe of cattle, <span id="fr_464"></span>[3](#fn_463.md) but according to
R. Eleazar and R. Simeon, it is on the 1st of Tishri. The 1st of Tishri
is New Year's \[day\] for the ordinary or civil year, for the
computation of the seventh years \[or years

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

of release\] <span id="fr_465"></span>[4](#fn_464.md), and of the jubilees;
also for the planting of trees, <span id="fr_466"></span>[5](#fn_465.md)
and for herbs. <span id="fr_467"></span>[6](#fn_466.md) On the first of
Sebat is the new year for trees, <span id="fr_468"></span>[7](#fn_467.md)
according to Beth Shammai; but Beth Hillel say, "it is on the fifteenth
of the same month."

§ 2. The world is judged at four periods in each year; on pass- over, in
respect to the growth of corn; <span id="fr_469"></span>[8](#fn_468.md) on
the feast of weeks, concerning the fruit of trees; on the feast of new
year, when all human beings pass like lambs before God's throne, in
order to be judged; as it is said (Ps. xxx. 9), "He who hath fashioned
all their hearts, understandeth all their works;" and on the feast of
tabernacles judgment is passed concerning the water \[or rain\].

§ 3. Messengers were sent out <span id="fr_470"></span>[9](#fn_469.md) for
the following six months: for Nissan, on account of the Passover; for
Ab, on account of the fast; for Elul, on account of the feast of new
year; for Tishri, on account of the regulation of the festivals; <span
id="fr_471"></span>[10](#fn_470.md) for Kislev, on account of the feast of
dedication; for Adar, on account of the feast of lots; and also for
Iyar, during the existence of the second Temple, on account of the
little \[or second\] Passover.

§ 4. For the new moons of two months \[the witnesses\] may profane the
Sabbath: <span id="fr_472"></span>[11](#fn_471.md) viz. for those of
Nissan, and of Tishri; because, on these months only, the messengers
went to Syria, and the festivals are regulated by them; and during the
existence of the Temple it was lawful to profane the Sabbath for any
month, on account of the regulation of the offerings \[on the feast of
new moon\] in their proper day.

§ 5. Whether the moon had been seen high on the horizon, <span
id="fr_473"></span>[12](#fn_472.md) or had

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

not appeared thus high, the Sabbath may be profaned \[by the
witnesses\]. R. José says, "If the moon appeared high on the horizon the
Sabbath may not be profaned by them \[to announce it\]."

§ 6. It happened once, that more than forty pair of witnesses passed
through on the Sabbath, when R. Akivah detained them at Lydda \[‏לוד‎\];
Rabbon Gamaliel then sent word, saying, "If thou thus detainest the
people, thou wilt be the cause of their straying in future" \[they will
refuse to come\].

§ 7. When father and son have seen the new moon, they must both go to
the tribunal of judgment \[Beth Din\], not that they may be combined
together to act as witnesses, but in order that, should the evidence of
either of them be invalidated, the other may join to give evidence with
another witness. R. Simeon says, "Father and son, and relatives in every
degree, may be allowed as competent witnesses to give evidence as to the
appearance of the new moon." R. José says, "It once happened that Tobias
the physician, his son, and his freed slave, saw the new moon in
Jerusalem, \[and when they tendered their evidence\] the priests
accepted his evidence, and that of his son, but invalidated that of his
freed slave; but when they appeared before the 'Beth Din,' <span
id="fr_474"></span>[13](#fn_473.md) they received his evidence, and that of
his freed slave, but invalidated that of his son."

§ 8. The following are considered incompetent witnesses: gamblers with
dice, usurers, <span id="fr_475"></span>[14](#fn_474.md) pigeon
breeders, <span id="fr_476"></span>[15](#fn_475.md) those who trade in the
produce of the Sabbatical year, and also slaves. The rule is, that all
evidence that cannot be received from a woman cannot be received from
any of these.

§ 9. A person who has seen the new moon, but is unable to go \[to give
evidence\], must be brought \[if unable to walk\] mounted on an asses or
even in a bed. Persons afraid of being waylaid by robbers may take
sticks with them; <span id="fr_477"></span>[16](#fn_476.md) and if they
have a long way to go, it will be lawful for them to provide for
themselves, and carry their food. <span id="fr_478"></span>[16](#fn_476.md)
Whenever \[witnesses\] must be a day and a night on the road, it will be
lawful to profane the Sabbath to travel thereon, to

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

give their evidence as to the appearance of the new moon. For thus is it
written (Lev. xxiii. 4), "These are the feasts of the Lord, the holy
convocations, which *ye* shall proclaim in their appointed seasons."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_461"></span>[156:1](etm085.htm#fr_462.md) The reign of Jewish
kings, whatever the period of accession might be, was always reckoned
from the preceding Nissan; so that if, for instance. a Jewish king began
to reign in Adar, the following month \[Nissan\] would be considered as
the commencement of the second year of his reign. This rule was observed
in all legal contracts, in which the reign of kings was always
mentioned.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[156:2](etm085.htm#fr_463.md) This is in respect
to a person who has neglected to observe his vow, the period of which
neglect may not extend above three festivals from the time of the vow,
of which the festival in Nissan, or Passover, is the first.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[156:3](etm085.htm#fr_464.md) In order to keep the
tithes of different years distinct.

announce to other places the day on which the Sanhedrin had fixed the
day of the last new moon.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[157:10](etm085.htm#fr_471.md) The day of
Atonement, and feast of Tabernacles; inasmuch, as it was possible that
the Sanhedrin might have made the preceding month Elul intercalary
‏מעוברת‎.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[157:11](etm085.htm#fr_472.md) To travel thereon
to Jerusalem, to acquaint the Sanhedrin of their having seen the new
moon.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[157:12](etm085.htm#fr_473.md) When it is to be
supposed it had also been seen at Jerusalem; and that, consequently, the
Sabbath need not be profaned by the witnesses travelling thereon to
Jerusalem.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[158:13](etm085.htm#fr_474.md) The tribunal of
judgment—the Sanhedrin.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[158:14](etm085.htm#fr_475.md) This includes all
games of hazard; usurers and gamblers being considered as reputed
thieves. (See Sanhedrin, c. iii.)

<span id="fn_475"></span>[158:15](etm085.htm#fr_476.md) Those who breed and
train pigeons for gambling purposes; such as, betting on their velocity
of flight, or to train them to entice the pigeons of others to the
dovecote, &c.

Sabbath.
