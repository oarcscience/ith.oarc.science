*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. Fifteen classes of women release themselves, their rivals, <span
id="fr_662"></span>[1](#fn_659.md) and the rivals of these, *ad infinitum*,
from the obligation of *Chalitzah* and *Yeboom;* these are \[when the
widow of the deceased is\], (1) the \[illegitimate\] daughter of the
brother, or (2) her daughter, or (3) the daughter of his
\[illegitimate\] son, or (4) his wife's daughter, or (5) her son's
daughter, or (6) her daughter's daughter, or (7) his mother-in-law, or
(8) the mother of his mother-in-law, or (9) the mother of his
father-in-law, or (10) his uterine or maternal sister, or (11) his
mother's sister, or (12) his wife's sister, or (13) the widow of his
uterine or maternal brother, or (14) the widow of a brother who had not
been contemporary with him, <span id="fr_663"></span>[2](#fn_660.md) or
(15) his daughter-in-law. <span id="fr_664"></span>[3](#fn_661.md) All
these release their rivals, and the rivals of these, *ad infinitum*,
from the obligation of *Chalitzah* and *Yeboom*. If, however, any of
these had died, or refused her consent, <span
id="fr_665"></span>[4](#fn_662.md) or had been divorced, or is unfit for
procreation, <span id="fr_666"></span>[5](#fn_663.md) their rivals may be
married by *Yeboom;* yet, refusal of consent, or of unfitness \[to
procreate\], cannot be applied in respect to his mother-in-law, or the
mother of his father-in-law.

§ 2. How is this release of rivals \[by the mentioned classes of women\]
to be understood? When a person's daughter, or one of the mentioned
forbidden degrees \[of intermarriage\] was married to

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

his brother, who at his decease \[without issue\] left another wife
besides her, then, even as the daughter is released \[as he may not
marry her\], thus also is her rival released. If such a rival of the
daughter should marry the second \[or other\] brother, who at his
decease left another wife besides her, then, even as the rival of his
daughter is released \[as he may not marry the former rival of his
daughter\], thus does the rival of that rival become also released, and
thus in the same manner even if there should be a hundred \[brothers\].
How is it to be understood that when these have died, it is permitted to
marry their rivals by *Yeboom?* If his daughter, or one of the mentioned
degrees prohibited to intermarry, was married to his brother, who had
another wife besides, and his daughter had died, or had been divorced
before the decease of his brother \[to whom she had been married\], then
is he permitted to marry her by *Yeboom*. If any of these relatives had
been qualified to refuse her consent, and did not refuse, her rival must
perform the ceremony of *Chalitzah*, but cannot be married to her
brother-in-law by *Yeboom*.

§ 3. In the case of the \[hereafter to be mentioned\] six more rigidly
prohibited degrees of relationship, in which the women may be married to
others only \[viz. to strangers and not to the brothers\], it is
permitted to him to marry their rivals, after the decease of their
husband; viz. his mother's, his father's wife's, his father's sister's,
of a sister of father's side, of the wife of his father's brother, and
of the wife of his brother by father's side.

§ 4. Beth Shammai permit brothers to marry \[by *Yeboom*\] the rivals of
women \[who are in forbidden degrees of relationship to them\]; but Beth
Hillel prohibit it. If such had performed the ceremony of *Chalitzah*,
they are disqualified according to Beth Shammai to marry a priest; but
Beth Hillel declare them qualified. If the brother-in-law had married
any of them \[by *Yeboom*\], Beth Shammai permit them, in case they had
again become widows, to marry a Cohen; but Beth Hillel prohibit it: and
although one school prohibits what the other permits, and one declares
as an invalid marriage that which by the other is considered a valid
one, yet the disciples of either school did not refrain from
intermarrying with each other; and also in respect to those laws of
clean and unclean things, in which they differ in opinion, they did not
refuse to lend each other vessels to be used for purposes which both
schools considered as clean and lawful to be used. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_659"></span>[201:1](etm105.htm#fr_662.md) By this appellation,
the Mishna designates the several wives of one man, who are called
‏צרות‎ \[i.e. troubles, adversaries, or rivals\], to each other,
inasmuch as Kimchi observes in his Commentary \[to 1 Sam. i. 6, where
this word occurs\], they are most often sources of trouble, jealousy,
and vexation to each other.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[201:2](etm105.htm#fr_663.md) This will be
explained in the next chapter.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[201:3](etm105.htm#fr_664.md) Namely, the widow of
his son, who subsequently had married his \[deceased\] brother.

<span id="fn_662"></span>[201:4](etm105.htm#fr_665.md) A girl betrothed in
her infancy may afterwards refuse to ratify the contract on becoming of
age, when she objects to the husband to whom she had been betrothed by
her parents, or brothers; see further, chap. XIII. of this Treatise.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[201:5](etm105.htm#fr_666.md) The ‏אילונית‎, by
which term the Mishna describes a female whose voice is like that of a
man, and whose formation differs in other respects from persons of her
sex.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[202:6](etm105.htm#fr_667.md) And with respect to
those about which they differed, they used to give each other
notice.—<span class="smallcaps">Bartenora</span>.
