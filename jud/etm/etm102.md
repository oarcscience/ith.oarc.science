*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER III.

§ 1. The following may \[privately\] shave \[trim their hair\] on the
Moed:—he who arrives from beyond seas, or returns from captivity, or has
been discharged from prison, or an excommunicated \[person\] whom the
sages have absolved; likewise, he who has consulted a sage and been
absolved, <span id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_634) also the nazir, <span
id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_635) and the leper, who from \[a state of\]
uncleanness is restored to cleanness.

§ 2. The following may wash \[their garments\] on the Moed:—he who
arrives from beyond seas, or returns from captivity, or has been
discharged from prison, and an excommunicated person whom the sages have
absolved; also, he who consulted a sage, and by him had been absolved.
Towels, barber's napkins, and bathing-towels \[may be washed during the
Moed\]. Men and women who have had a running issue; women after their
courses or lying-in; \[in short\] all \[persons\] who from \[a state
of\] uncleanness are restored to cleanness, are permitted \[to wash
their garments\], but all other persons are forbidden \[so to do\].

§ 3. The following \[documents\] may be written during the Moed:
contracts of betrothing, <span id="fr_639"></span>[3](#fn_636) bills of
divorce, <span id="fr_640"></span>[4](#fn_637) and receipts \[in
discharge

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

of debts\]; <span id="fr_641"></span>[5](#fn_638) also wills or
codicils, <span id="fr_642"></span>[6](#fn_639) deeds of gift,
premonitions, <span id="fr_643"></span>[7](#fn_640) appraisements, <span
id="fr_644"></span>[8](#fn_641) and deeds of maintenance, <span
id="fr_645"></span>[9](#fn_642) certificates of ‏חליצה‎, <span
id="fr_646"></span>[10](#fn_643) and of refusal, <span
id="fr_647"></span>[11](#fn_644) arbitration-bonds, <span
id="fr_648"></span>[12](#fn_645) decrees of the Beth Din, and powers of
attorney.

§ 4. They must not write bonds \[to secure payment\] of debts during the
Moed; but if he \[the lender\] has no faith in him \[the borrower\], or
if he has nothing to eat, then \[the bond\] may he written. <span
id="fr_649"></span>[13](#fn_646) They must not write rolls of the Law,
Tephilin, or Mezoozoth, during the Moed, and must not correct a single
letter even in the roll of the law of ‏עזרא‎, (Ezra), \[another version
has of the ‏עזרה‎, Azarah, outer court of the Temple <span
id="fr_650"></span>[14](#fn_647)\]. R. Jehudah saith, "A man may write
Tephilin and Mezoozoth for his own use, and he may also spin sky blue
wool for Zizith, in his lap."

§ 5. He who buried his dead \[relative\] three days before the
commencement of the festival, is freed from the seven \[days of deep
mourning\]; if \[he buried his dead\] eight days \[before the
festival\],

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

he is freed from the thirty \[days of mourning\], because they \[the
sages\] held that the Sabbath enters \[into the computation\], but does
not supersede \[the mourning, whereas\] the festivals supersede \[the
mourning\], but do not enter \[into the computation <span
id="fr_651"></span>[15](#fn_648)\].

§ 6. R. Eleazar saith, "Since the destruction of the Temple, the
festival of weeks \[Pentecost\] is \[in respect to mourning, to be
considered\] like the Sabbath." R. Gamaliel saith, "The new year and the
day of atonement are \[to be considered\] like festivals;" but the sages
hold not with the dictum of the one or of the other, but \[decide that\]
the festival of weeks is like other festivals, and the new year and day
of atonement are like the Sabbath." <span
id="fr_652"></span>[16](#fn_649)

§ 7. They are not to rend their garments, nor lay bare their
shoulder, <span id="fr_653"></span>[17](#fn_650) not eat the
funeral-meal \[during the Moed\], unless they be near relatives of the
deceased; <span id="fr_654"></span>[18](#fn_651) the funeral-meal is not
to be

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

taken except on a couch, standing up properly. <span
id="fr_655"></span>[19](#fn_652) \[The food for such a meal\] is not
placed before the mourners on a table, nor in a silver tureen, nor in a
dish, but in wicker baskets. <span id="fr_656"></span>[20](#fn_653) The
mourning prayer must not be said during the Moed, but the rows are
formed, <span id="fr_657"></span>[21](#fn_654) and the \[usual form of\]
consolation is pronounced, and the people assembled are at once
dismissed.

§ 8. They must not set down \[rest\] the bier in any public place, that
the mourning may not spread. The bier of women \[must\] at no time \[be
there set down\], on account of \[the\] respect \[due to the sex of the
deceased\]. The mourning-women may wail during the Moed, but not clap
\[their palms together\]. R. Ishmael saith, "Those nearest to the bier,
may clap \[the palms of their hands together\]." <span
id="fr_658"></span>[22](#fn_655)

§ 9. On the festivals of the new moon, of dedication, and of purim, they
\[the mourning-women\] may wail \[aloud\] and clap \[the palms of their
hands together\], but must not sing lamentations \[funeral dirges\]; but
when the corpse is interred, they must neither wail aloud, nor sing
dirges. What is \[meant by the expression\] wailing? When all of
them <span id="fr_659"></span>[23](#fn_656) join in one chorus. What is
\[meant by the expression\] lamentation \[dirge\]? When one recites and
the others respond \[or repeat after her\], as it is said, "Teach your
daughters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation." <span
id="fr_660"></span>[24](#fn_657) But of future \[ages\] that are to come
it is said, "Death shall be swallowed \[destroyed\] for ever, and the
Lord will wipe away tears from off all faces," &c. <span
id="fr_661"></span>[25](#fn_658)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_634"></span>[196:1](etm102.htm#fr_637) From a vow he had
made not to have his hair cut for a certain period; which vow he repents
of, and desires to annul, but could not, before the Moed, meet with a
sage who would consent to absolve him.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[196:2](etm102.htm#fr_638) Vide Numbers vi.
1–21; in case the time of his vow expires during the Moed. This is also
the case with all the permissions here granted, i.e. the person arriving
from beyond seas, or returning from captivity, &c., must so arrive or
return on the Moed.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[196:3](etm102.htm#fr_639) The marriage
subsequently to be completed under the nuptial canopy, and by
consummation, when a regular marriage contract is granted. (Vide
Treatise Kedushin.)

<span id="fn_637"></span>[196:4](etm102.htm#fr_640) Granted by men who
have been drawn to serve in the wars, and who must leave during the
Moed.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[197:5](etm102.htm#fr_641) In cases where the
acknowledgment has been lost, and the debtor refuses payment.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[197:6](etm102.htm#fr_642) To the will of a
person dangerously ill, or dying.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[197:7](etm102.htm#fr_643) ‏פרוזבולין‎ (Vide
Treatise Sheviith, chap. X. § 7); a legal deed, by means of which the
lender gave notice to the Beth Din, that he reserved unto himself the
right of enforcing payment against the debtor at any time. It was
introduced by the elder Hillel in consequence of poor people being
exposed to great distress, because the wealthy refused to accommodate
them with any loans, which, according to Deut. xv., they could not
recover after the seventh, or Sabbatical year. This notice had to be
given before the seventh year commenced.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[197:8](etm102.htm#fr_644) Appraisements made
by order of the Beth Din, in case the debtor's real property was to be
assigned to his creditors.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[197:9](etm102.htm#fr_645) By which the Beth
Din allowed aliments to the wife and children out of a man's estate, or
by which he undertook to maintain his step-daughter.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[197:10](etm102.htm#fr_646) Vide Treatise
Yebamoth, chap. XII. § 1 and 6.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[197:11](etm102.htm#fr_647) Vide Treatise
Yebamoth, chap. XIII. § 1.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[197:12](etm102.htm#fr_648) Lest one of two
litigants, who has agreed to submit his disputes to arbitration \[a
method of settling differences much encouraged by the Mishna\], withdraw
his consent; which, when the arbitration bonds have actually been
signed, he no longer has the power to do.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[197:13](etm102.htm#fr_649) As the bond may he
executed after the Moed, unless the lender has so little faith in the
honesty of his debtor as to suspect he might, at a later period, deny
the loan, and contend it was a gift. The words, "if he has nothing to
eat," are by some made to refer to the debtor, while others apply it to
the writer of the bond, whose subsistence depends on his earnings.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[197:14](etm102.htm#fr_650) The roll of the law
written by Ezra himself; others suppose it to have been that roll of the
law which was kept in the outer court of the Temple, that the Mishna
here instances as most venerable.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[198:15](etm102.htm#fr_651) The Sabbath is
included in the number of the seven days of deep mourning, but does not
supersede them; for if it did, there never could be seven days of deep
mourning completed, as the intervening Sabbath would reduce the number.
The festivals are not included in the number of the days of mourning, as
they entirely supersede the seven days of deep mourning; and the portion
of the thirty days mourning, which has expired before the festival, is
carried forward till after the festival, and then added to the number of
days, which complete the thirty. The mourning properly commences from
the time the coffin is closed, hence the expression of the Mishna, "who
buried his dead." The degrees of consanguinity which exact the full
mourning \[Sheebah, the seven days of deep mourning, and Sheloshim, the
thirty days of mourning\], are: first, father; second, mother; third,
son; fourth, daughter; fifth, brother; sixth, sister; and seventh,
spouse. The *halachah* is, that should a man bury his dead relative,
even one hour before the festival comes in, he is freed from the seven
days of deep mourning.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[198:16](etm102.htm#fr_652) In the days of the
second Temple, the sacrifices which every Israelite was bound to offer
on the Pentecost, could, in case of omission, be brought during the six
days next after the feast. This alone, according to the opinion of R.
Eleazar, assimilated the Pentecost with the other two festivals of
longer duration; a similarity which he thought ceased with the cessation
of the extended privilege, at the destruction of the Temple. The
*halachah* is, that all the festivals, including the new year and day of
atonement, equally supersede the seven days of deep mourning.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[198:17](etm102.htm#fr_653) A sign of mourning
anciently exhibited, but now in desuetude.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[198:18](etm102.htm#fr_654) In one of the seven
degrees of consanguinity enumerated in note 15 to the preceding
paragraph. The exception to this rule is at the death of a distinguished
sage, or chief of a congregation, who is considered as an ornament to
the human race, and dear to all men as if he were their nearest
relative.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[199:19](etm102.htm#fr_655) At all other times
the couches, which in the east are used as chairs, are turned over, as
the mourners must not use them in the ordinary way.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[199:20](etm102.htm#fr_656) That no distinction
he made between rich and poor.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[199:21](etm102.htm#fr_657) Vide Treatise
Berachoth, chap. III. § 2, and note thereto.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[199:22](etm102.htm#fr_658) It was the custom
in the times of the Mishna, to hire women whose profession it was to
attend funerals, where they wailed, clapped their hands, &c.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[199:23](etm102.htm#fr_659) The hired mourners.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[199:24](etm102.htm#fr_660) Jer. ix. 20.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[199:25](etm102.htm#fr_661) Isa. xxv. 8.
