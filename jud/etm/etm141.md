### CHAPTER VII.

§ 1. If a person seized with Cardiacos <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1](#fn_1050.md) should say, "Write a Get for my
wife," <span id="fr_1056"></span>[2](#fn_1051.md) his words are not to be
noticed. If he said \[before he was taken ill\], "Write a Get for my
wife," and when seized with the Cardiacos, he said, "Do not write it,"
his last words are not to

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

be noticed. When a person became dumb, and on being asked, "Shall we
write a Get for your wife?" nods his head \[in token of assent\], he
shall be questioned three times, and if he \[by his motions or
gestures\] answers rightly the questions proposed to him, both
affirmative and negative, they may in that case write a Get and deliver
it to his wife.

§ 2. If a person \[in health, or a sick person acquainted with the Law\]
is asked, "Shall we write a Get for your wife?" and he answered, "Write
it;" and they ordered the notary in consequence, who wrote it, and the
witnesses, who signed it: although it was duly written, attested and
delivered to the husband, who delivered it to his wife, nevertheless it
is ineffective, because it is only then valid when the husband himself
orders the notary to write, and the witnesses to attest it.

§ 3. \[When a husband says to his wife\] "This is your Get in case I
die," or, "If I die of this illness," or, "To take effect after my
decease," his words are vain; <span id="fr_1057"></span>[3](#fn_1052.md)
but if he said, "Here is your Get, to take effect from this day," or,
"from this moment, if I should die," it is a valid Get. If he said, "To
take effect from this day and after my death," it is doubtful whether
such Get is valid or not: <span id="fr_1058"></span>[4](#fn_1053.md) and in
case he dies \[without leaving issue\], his widow must perform the
ceremony of Chalitzah to her brother-in-law, but the latter may not
marry her by Yeboom. <span id="fr_1059"></span>[5](#fn_1054.md) If he said,
"This is your Get from this day if I die of this illness," and he rose
\[from his sick bed\], went out into the street, and became ill again
and died: if he died in consequence of a relapse of the former illness
the Get is valid, but not otherwise.

§ 4. Under the mentioned circumstances <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[6](#fn_1055.md) the wife may not meet the husband but
in the presence of witnesses. <span id="fr_1061"></span>[7](#fn_1056.md) A
slave or a bondwoman is a competent witness for this purpose, her own
bondwoman

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

excepted, because a mistress is usually quite familiar with such a
one. <span id="fr_1062"></span>[8](#fn_1057.md) How is she to be considered
during that interval? <span id="fr_1063"></span>[9](#fn_1058.md) According
to R. Jehudah, "As a married woman in every respect," but according to
R. José, "As one whose divorce is doubtful."

§ 5. If he \[a husband\] says, "Here is your Get, on condition that you
give me two hundred zooz," she is divorced from the moment she accepts
the Get, and is bound to pay the stipulated amount. If he said, "On
condition that you give me \[two hundred zooz, or any other sum\] within
thirty days," and she consented and paid the amount agreed upon within
the time stipulated, she is duly divorced, but not if she did not pay it
within that time. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel relates, "That once at Sidon a
husband said to his wife, 'Here is your Get, on condition that you give
me my ‏אצטלית‎,' <span id="fr_1064"></span>[10](#fn_1059.md) and she lost
it: <span id="fr_1065"></span>[11](#fn_1060.md) the sages decided that the
Get should be still valid, if she paid him a sum equal to the value
thereof."

§ 6. If a husband says to his wife, "Here is your Get, on condition that
you wait on my father," or "suckle my child" \[the period allowed for
the general duration of suckling a child is two years\]. What period is
she bound to suckle it? R. Jehudah saith, "Eighteen months only, and if
during that period the child or the father should die, the Get is
valid." If he said, "Here is your Get, on condition that you wait on my
father for two years," or "suckle my child two years," and either the
child or the father dies, or that the latter refuses her services,
without being angry with her, the Get is not valid: but Rabbon Simeon
ben Gamaliel considers it valid under the mentioned circumstances, for
he establishes it as a rule "That every impediment which does not
proceed from the part of the wife does not render the Get void."

§ 7. Should a husband say to his wife, "Here is your Get if I do not
return within thirty days," <span id="fr_1066"></span>[12](#fn_1061.md) and
intending to travel from Judea

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

into Galilee he returned after having proceeded to Antipatris <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[13](#fn_1062.md) only, he has voided his condition. If
he said, "Here is thy Get if I do not return within thirty days," and
intending to travel from Judea to Galilee returns from the village
Otenai, <span id="fr_1068"></span>[14](#fn_1063.md) he has voided his
condition. <span id="fr_1069"></span>[15](#fn_1064.md) If he said, "Here is
thy Get if I do not return within thirty days," and intending to travel
beyond sea he went only as far as Acco <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[16](#fn_1065.md) and returned, he has voided his
condition. If he said, "Here is thy Get if at any time I should stay
away for thirty days from thee," though he should frequently go and
return for that period, the Get is valid, provided he did not remain
alone with her.

§ 8. When a husband said to his wife, "Here is thy Get if I do not
return within a twelve-month," and he died within that twelvemonth, the
Get is void; but if he said, "This is thy Get from the *present moment*,
if I do not return within a twelvemonth from this day," and he died
within that time, the Get is valid.

§ 9. When a husband said, "If I do not return within a twelvemonth from
this day, write ye, and deliver a Get to my wife;" if they wrote it
within the twelve-month, but did not deliver it till after that time,
the Get is void. If he said, "Write ye, and deliver a Get to my wife if
I do not return within a twelve-month from this day;" if they wrote it
within that time, but did not deliver it till after the expiration
thereof, the Get is void. R. José saith, "It is valid in similar cases."
If they wrote and delivered it after the expiration of the twelve-month,
and the husband died meanwhile; if the delivery of the Get preceded the
death of the husband, the Get is valid, but not if posterior to that
event; and where it cannot be ascertained which event was prior to the
other, she is to be considered as one whose divorce is doubtful.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1050"></span>[295:1](etm141.htm#fr_1055.md) Hebrew
‏קוֹרְדִיָקוֹם‎, and in other copies of the Mishna ‏קַרְדִקוֹם‎. This
word, which signifies a species of disease, is probably derived from the
Latin. Commentators differ widely as to what disease is here alluded to.
Maimonides explains it to be a determination of blood to the vessels of
the brain, affecting the patient's reasoning faculties. According to the
"Aruch" the word is of Greek origin, and signifies an affection of the
digestive organs. This is corroborated by Celsus, who describes a
similar disease under the same name. But De Pomis, and the modern
lexicographers, explain it to be a preternatural palpitation of *the
heart*.—"Affectus *cordis* in quo sentitur pulsatio præter naturam." (De
Pomis, Lexicon ad literam.)

<span id="fn_1051"></span>[295:2](etm141.htm#fr_1056.md) That is, "To
divorce her," and in this sense throughout.

<span id="fn_1052"></span>[296:3](etm141.htm#fr_1057.md) Because the right
of divorce does not exist after death, as that event dissolves the
marriage tie.

<span id="fn_1053"></span>[296:4](etm141.htm#fr_1058.md) Because it is
uncertain whether the husband really meant that the Get should be
effective from that day if he were to die, and the condition being
confirmed by the event of his death, the Get should be valid; or,
whether he said at first, "The Get is to be effective from that day,"
and he then changed his mind, saying, "\[It will not take effect\] till
after my decease," in which case it is void, for the reason stated in
the preceding note.

<span id="fn_1054"></span>[296:5](etm141.htm#fr_1059.md) On account of the
doubt as to the validity of the Get.

<span id="fn_1055"></span>[296:6](etm141.htm#fr_1060.md) Viz. when the
husband said, "This is your Get from this day and when I die."

<span id="fn_1056"></span>[296:7](etm141.htm#fr_1061.md) Lest he might have
intercourse with her.

<span id="fn_1057"></span>[297:8](etm141.htm#fr_1062.md) And perhaps she
may not be ashamed before her, &c. (Compare chap. VIII. § 9 of this
Treatise.)

<span id="fn_1058"></span>[297:9](etm141.htm#fr_1063.md) This does not
relate to the last mentioned case, but to that of a husband who is
dying, and says to his wife, "From this moment, and while I am alive
thou shalt be divorced by this Get, provided I *now* die and do not
recover."

<span id="fn_1059"></span>[297:10](etm141.htm#fr_1064.md) This word is of
Greek origin ("stolium"), and signifies an ornamental or state dress.
According to De Pomis it is a kind of cloak or upper garment. "Stola" in
Latin, probably the same as the English word "stole."

<span id="fn_1060"></span>[297:11](etm141.htm#fr_1065.md) And of course
could not give that *identical* dress.

<span id="fn_1061"></span>[297:12](etm141.htm#fr_1066.md) According to the
Gemarah the following words must be added to this and the following
proposition, "If I arrive at Galilee or—" i.e., that the husband <span
id="page_298">p. 298</span> made a double condition, viz., "If I arrive
in Galilee the Get shall be valid *immediately*, but if not, it shall be
valid only in case I do not return within thirty days."

<span id="fn_1062"></span>[298:13](etm141.htm#fr_1067.md) A place on the
extreme limits of Judea.

<span id="fn_1063"></span>[298:14](etm141.htm#fr_1068.md) Situated on the
confines of Galilee.

<span id="fn_1064"></span>[298:15](etm141.htm#fr_1069.md) And the Get in
this and in the preceding cases is void.

<span id="fn_1065"></span>[298:16](etm141.htm#fr_1070.md) A sea-port on the
Mediterranean, now called Acre.
