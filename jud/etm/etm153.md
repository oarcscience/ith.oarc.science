### CHAPTER III.

§ 1. The following internal wounds or defects render animals
Terefá: <span id="fr_1204"></span>[1](#fn_1199.md) when the œsophagus is
perforated; <span id="fr_1205"></span>[2](#fn_1200.md) when the trachea is
split or torn across in its width; when the membrane or thin skin
\[which is innermost and nearest\] to the brain is perforated; when the
heart is perforated till within the cavity of its two ventricles; when
the spine is broken, and the spinal chord is severed; when the liver is
wanting, and not a vestige thereof remains; when there is a perforation
through the two membranes covering the lungs; when the lungs are
deficient \[of any of their lobes\]; R. Simeon saith, "\[An animal is
only then Terefá\] when the lungs are perforated within the bronchial
tubes;" when there is a hole in the maw, or in the gallbladder, or in
the thin or small intestines; when there is a hole in the interior or
lower stomach, or that the greatest part of the external fleshy part
thereof is torn; R. Jehudah saith, "If a hand-breadth is torn off in
large cattle \[oxen or cows, it is Terefá\], but in a small one \[a
calf, &c.\] when the greatest part thereof is torn; when there is a
perforation in the omasum \[many plies\] and the magnus venter

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

or upper stomach, beyond the place where they are connected; <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[3](#fn_1201.md) when the animal fell off a roof; when
the greater part of its ribs are fractured, or when it had been hugged
by a wolf \[with its fore-paws or claws\]; R. Jehudah saith, "The hug of
a wolf causes small cattle only to become Terefá, but large ones only
become so when a lion had struck its claws or fangs in them." Small
birds are Terefá when a sparrow-hawk had struck its talons in them; and
large birds \[as fowls, geese, &c.\] when they were struck by a
\[falcon, eagle, or other\] large bird of prey. This is the rule. "When
an animal under similar circumstances cannot survive, it is Terefá."

§ 2. The following cases are Cashér: when the trachea is perforated or
split. Of what size may the deficient part be? According to Rabbon
Simeon ben Gamaliel, "As large as an \[Italian\] asser." <span
id="fr_1207"></span>[4](#fn_1202.md) When the bones of the skull are
wounded, but the interior skin of the brain is uninjured; when there is
a perforation in the heart, but not quite through to within the
ventricles; when the vertebræ of the spine are broken, but the spinal
chord was not severed; when the liver is deficient, but a small piece
thereof of the size of an olive remained; when the omasum and the upper
stomach are pierced one within the other; when the animal is deficient
of milt or kidneys, or nether jaw, or matrix, or when through fear
\[from the appearance of any of the phenomena of nature\] caused by the
hand of God, its

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

lungs had become dessicated. R. Meir considers also an animal whose skin
was stripped off as Cashér, but the other sages consider it Pasool,

§ 3. The following defects render fowl Terefá: when the œsophagus is
perforated; when the trachea is torn off; when a weasel bit it on the
head, in a place where it may render it Terefá \[viz. near the brain\];
when the stomach or thin intestines are perforated; when it had fallen
into the fire; when its viscera <span id="fr_1208"></span>[5](#fn_1203.md)
had become scorched, if they had turned yellow it is Terefá, but when
they remained red it is Cashér; <span id="fr_1209"></span>[6](#fn_1204.md)
when a person had trodden on it, or knocked it against a wall, or that
it was trodden upon by cattle, and it struggles and lives twenty-four
hours after the accident \[and was then slaughtered\], it is Cashér.

§ 4. The following cases are Cashér in fowl: when the trachea is
perforated or split; when it was bitten by a weasel on its head, in a
place where it does not render it Terefá; when the crop is perforated,
and, according to Ribi, even when that organ is entirely deficient; when
the intestines protruded from the body without being perforated; when
its wings or legs are broken, or when its large feathers are plucked
off; R. Jehudah saith, "It is Pasool when stripped of its plumage."

§ 5. When an animal became ill through plethora of blood, or suffered
from a bad state of bile, or viscosity of mucus, or that it had fed on
the plant rosebay \[or the oleander\], or that it had swallowed fowl's
dung, or drank noxious water, it is Cashér; but when it had swallowed
poison, <span id="fr_1210"></span>[7](#fn_1205.md) or had been bitten by a
venomous serpent, although it is not prohibited as Terefá, yet it is
forbidden to be eaten, on account of the danger it may cause to the
persons eating thereof.

§ 6. The signs by which the clean animals, domestic and wild, may be
distinguished \[from the unclean and prohibited ones\] are mentioned in
the Holy Law, but not those of fowl. The sages have, however,
established, "That every \[predaceous\] bird, which strikes its talons
into its prey, is of the unclean: every bird which has an additional
claw, <span id="fr_1211"></span>[8](#fn_1206.md) a crop, and of which the
internal coat of the stomach

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

may be readily peeled off, is of the clean species." R. Eleazar ben
Zadok saith, "Every bird which \[when placed on a perch\] divides its
toes equally, is an unclean one."

§ 7. Of locusts, all the species are clean which have four feet, four
wings, and four leaping legs, and whose wings cover the greatest part of
its body; R. Jehudah saith, "Only then when they are called by the name
‏חגב‎." <span id="fr_1212"></span>[9](#fn_1207.md) Of fishes, are clean,
those furnished with fins and scales; R. Jehudah saith, "When they have
at least two scales and one fin." Scales are attached to the body of the
fish, and fins are the organs by which it moves through the water.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1199"></span>[332:1](etm153.htm#fr_1204.md) The word Terefá
\[‏טרפה‎\], in its ordinary acceptation, signifies an animal or bird
which was struck down, or mortally wounded, by another beast or bird of
prey. The flesh of an animal so struck it is not lawful to eat, as
appears from Exodus xxii. 31. When an animal has a wound, of which it is
held that it cannot survive, whether it is owing to accidental falls,
wounds, deficient organisation, or to any other cause, it is considered
Terefá, or prohibited to eat thereof, as of the flesh of a torn animal.

<span id="fn_1200"></span>[332:2](etm153.htm#fr_1205.md) Through both its
coats, the outer one of which is red, and the inner one white.

<span id="fn_1201"></span>[333:3](etm153.htm#fr_1206.md) For the proper
understanding of this Mishna, it is necessary to know, that the ox, and
other ruminants, have four stomachs. In the first two they ruminate, or
chew the cud of the grass, &c., they have but slightly macerated in
eating. After undergoing there a second maceration, it passes thence by
a narrow opening into the third and fourth stomachs, where it is finally
converted into nourishment. The first two of these \[for the second
stomach is only a prolongation of the first\] are called, in Hebrew,
‏בית הכוסות‎; the third stomach is called, in Hebrew, ‏מסס‎ \[the ‏ה‎
prefixed being only the denoting ‏ה‎, or article; but, according to
Buxtorf, it is derived from the Latin name, *omasum*\]; the fourth is
called ‏קיבה‎ or maw, where the food is farther prepared for being
absorbed by the lacteals and converted into chyle, for which purpose it
passes through the ‏דקין‎ small intestines. The following are the
Hebrew, English, and Latin names of the four stomachs:—the first
"stomach," or "paunch," "magnus venter rumen," or "penula;" the second
stomach is called "the honey-comb bag," "bonnet," or "king's-hood," in
English, and "reticulum arsineum," in Latin; these first two are here
called ‏בית הכוסות‎; the third is called the "many plus," or, rather,
"many plies,"—"omasum," in Latin, and ‏מסס‎ in Hebrew; the fourth is
called the "'red. abomasum faliscus ventriculus intestinalis," and
‏קיבה‎ in Hebrew.

<span id="fn_1202"></span>[333:4](etm153.htm#fr_1207.md) Vide Treatise
Kedushin, chap I., § 1, and note 4.

<span id="fn_1203"></span>[334:5](etm153.htm#fr_1208.md) Namely, the heart,
liver, and crop, which are naturally of a red color.

<span id="fn_1204"></span>[334:6](etm153.htm#fr_1209.md) In aquatic birds
when the mentioned parts have turned red from the accident, because they
are yellow in a sound state.

<span id="fn_1205"></span>[334:7](etm153.htm#fr_1210.md) Namely, a poison
which affects man, but is innoxious to cattle.

<span id="fn_1206"></span>[334:8](etm153.htm#fr_1211.md) Namely, that which
is placed behind, and above the front ones.

<span id="fn_1207"></span>[335:9](etm153.htm#fr_1212.md) This Hebrew word
signifies "locust."
