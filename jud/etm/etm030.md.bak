------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER VIII.

§ 1. Whoever carries out wine sufficient to mix a goblet \[of
wine\], <span id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114.md) \[such as is used at grace
after meat\], milk equal to a mouthful, honey sufficient to spread upon
a sore, oil sufficient to anoint a small limb \[joint\], water
sufficient to form a colyrium \[wash for one eye\], or of any other kind
of beverage, quarter of a lug, and also of whatever can be poured out
\[liquids\], quarter of a lug. R. Simeon saith, "For all \[the articles
here enumerated\] the legal quantity is one quarter lug; and the
\[various\] quantities here specified are only for those who conserve
\[keep the articles\].

§ 2. Whoever carries out rope sufficient to make a handle for a box,
\[basket\], or reed sufficient to make a hook for \[whereon to hang\] a
fine, or a coarse sieve; R. Jehudah saith, "Sufficient to take measure
for a child's shoe, paper sufficient to write thereon a toll-bill <span
id="fr_115"></span>[2](#fn_115.md), and, \[lastly, whoever carries out\] a
toll-bill of blotted paper, sufficient, to wrap a small balm flask
therein, is guilty."

§ 3. Vellum sufficient for an amulet, \[double wove parchment sufficient
to write a mezoozah thereon\], single wove parchment sufficient to write
thereon the smallest section \[parashah\] of the Tephilin, which is ‏שמע
ישראל‎, ink sufficient to write two letters, paint sufficient to dye one
eye. <span id="fr_116"></span>[3](#fn_116.md)

§ 4. Bird-lime sufficient to put on the top of the lime twig; pitch, or
sulphur, sufficient to fill up a tube of quicksilver; wax sufficient to
stop up a small leak \[in a wine cask\]; loam sufficient to make an

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

orifice \[for a bellows\], or the crucible of a gold refiner. R. Jehudah
saith, "sufficient to make a stand \[for such a crucible\], lime
sufficient to cover the little finger of a maiden." R. Jehudah saith,
"sufficient to cover one of her temples." R. Nehemiah saith, "sufficient
to anoint one of her temples \[withal\]." <span
id="fr_117"></span>[4](#fn_117.md)

§ 5. Red loam sufficient to seal a bale of goods. Such is the dictum of
R. Akivah; but the sages hold, "sufficient to seal a letter therewith."
Dung, or fine sand, sufficient to manure a cabbage-stalk. Such is the
dictum of R. Akivah; but the sages hold, "sufficient to manure a leek
therewith." Coarse sand sufficient to fill a trowel, reed sufficient to
make a writing-pen, and should it be thick or split, sufficient to boil
the lightest of eggs <span id="fr_118"></span>[5](#fn_118.md), \[which\],
mixed with oil, \[lies\] in a hot shell.

§ 6. Bone sufficient to make a spoon. R. Jehudah saith, "sufficient to
make \[a fitting\] for a key." Glass sufficient to scrape the top of a
weaver's shuttle therewith, a lump of mould, or a stone, large enough to
throw at a bird. R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, "large enough to throw at a
beast."

§ 7. Potsherds large enough to put between deals to poise them. Such is
the dictum of R. Jehudah; but R. Meir saith, "large enough to shovel up
ignited fuel therewith." R. José saith, "large enough to receive
\[hold\] quarter \[of a lug\]." R. Meir saith, "Although there is not
\[any absolute\] proof in support \[of my\] assertion, there is an
indication \[of my\] assertion; for it is said, 'There shall not be
found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the
hearth.'" <span id="fr_119"></span>[6](#fn_119.md) But R. José replied,
"\[Can you\] thence \[adduce\] a proof? \[Does not the sentence conclude
with the words\], 'or to take water withal out of the pit?'" <span
id="fr_120"></span>[7](#fn_120.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_114"></span>[48:1](etm030.htm#fr_114.md) The goblet holds one
quarter lug. The proportion in mixing is three parts water to one part
wine. Consequently, the quantity here meant, is, one-sixteenth of a lug.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[48:2](etm030.htm#fr_115.md) The toll-bill
contained two large sized letters.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[48:3](etm030.htm#fr_116.md) In the East it is
customary for women to dye their eye-lashes, and paint their eye-lids,
with paint prepared out of a root called hennah.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[49:4](etm030.htm#fr_117.md) It is an eastern
custom to apply an ointment made of lime to the forehead, as a cosmetic
to smoothen the skin.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[49:5](etm030.htm#fr_118.md) The egg of a domestic
fowl is considered as the lightest and quickest boiled of eggs.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[49:6](etm030.htm#fr_119.md) Isa. xxx. 14.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[49:7](etm030.htm#fr_120.md) Isa. xxx. 14.
