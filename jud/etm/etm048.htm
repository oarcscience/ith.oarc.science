<p>&sect; 1. Should an entry be higher than twenty amoth, [its height] must be lessened [by lowering the cross-beam]. R. Jehudah saith, "This is not necessary; should it be wider than ten amoth [its width] must be lessened; but if it has tine form [appearance] of a door [gate], even though it be wider than ten amoth, it is not necessary to lessen [its width]."</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. To legalize [the carrying or conveying within] an entry [to a place inclosed on three sides], Beth Shammai hold, "[that] a post and a beam [are required];" but Beth Hillel hold, "[that either] post or beam [is sufficient];" R. Eleazar saith, "two posts." On the authority of R. Ishmael, a disciple stated before R. Akivah "Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel did not differ [in opinion] as to an</p>  
<p><a name="page_72"><font size="1" color="green">p. 72</font></A></p>  
<p>entry less than four amoth wide, [for they both agreed that] such [an entry] becomes legalized either through a beam or a post." On what did they differ? [Respecting] entries upwards of four amoth wide, and up to ten amoth: of these Beth Shammai hold, "that a post and a beam are required;" while Beth Hillel hold, "[that either] post or beam [is sufficient]." R. Akivah said, "They differ as to the one and as to the other."</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. The beam in question must be wide enough to receive an &#8207;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1495;&#8206;, which is half of a brick, three hands in length and in width; it is, however, sufficient that the beam be one hand wide, so as to hold a half brick lengthwise.</p>  
<p>&sect; 4. [The beam must be] wide enough to hold a half brick, [and also] sound enough to bear one. R. Jehudah saith, "It must be wide [enough], even though it be not sound [enough]."</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. [Should the beam] be of straw or of reed, it is [in law] regarded as if it were of metal; should it be crooked [bent outwards], it is [in law] regarded as if it were straight; should it be cylindrical, it is [in law] regarded as if it were square. Whatever [measures] three hands in its circumference, holds one hand in width.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 6. The posts in question, must be ten hands high, be their breadth and thickness whatever it may: R. Jos&eacute; saith, "Their width must be three hands."</p>  
<p>&sect; 7. [Such] posts may be made out of any thing, even of that which is possessed of life; [this last, however,] R. Jos&eacute; prohibits. [A living animal tied on a grave to close it up] communicates uncleanness [even after it be removed therefrom]. R. Meir saith it is clean, "A letter of divorce for a woman may also be written thereon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> [a living animal];" but R. Jos&eacute;, the Galil&aelig;an, pronounces it "[the letter of divorce so written] null, [not valid in law]."</p>  
<p>&sect; 8. Should a caravan encamp in a valley, and a fence be made around it with the cattle's gear, it is lawful to move things within the fence [on the day of rest]; provided always that the fence be ten hands high, and the gaps [open spaces] therein, do not exceed [in extent] the actual fencing. Every gap [avenue] which is about ten hands [wide], is permitted; for it is considered as a door [gate], [hut gaps which are] more than ten hands wide are prohibited.</p>

<p>&sect; 9. [The caravan may also be] fenced round with three ropes, one above the other; provided always there be between each rope less than three hands [interspace], and that the measure [width or thickness] of the three ropes [together] exceed one hand, so that the whole make up [the] ten hands.</p>  
<p>&sect; 10. The caravan may also be fenced round with cane-laths; provided always the interspace between cane and cane be less than three hands. [All these regulations are limited to] spoken of a caravan [only]. Such is the dictum of R. Jehudah; but the sages maintain, "[that] the caravan is [especially] spoken of, solely [in order to adduce an instance] from that which actually exists."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Any partition which is not [constructed on the principle] of warp and shoot is not a [lawful] partition. Such is the dictum of R. Jos&eacute; bar Jehudah; but the sages hold, "[the constructing it according to] either one of the two [principles is sufficient]." Four immunities have been granted [to warriors] in a camp: they may bring wood from any place [without respecting the rights of ownership]; they need not wash their hands before meals; they may eat of &#8207;&#1491;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#8206;;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and they are absolved from the obligation of erub.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>
