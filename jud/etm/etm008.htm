<p>&sect; 1. Three men who have eaten together, are bound to join in the &#8207;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206; [preparation to say grace after meat]. If a person has eaten of &#8207;&#1491;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#8206; [that which is subject to the doubt, whether it has paid tithe or not], or of first tithe, from which the heave offering has been taken; or of second tithe or consecrated things which have been redeemed: also, if the waiter [or attendant] has partaken of their meal, a quantity of the size of an olive,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> [or if] a Samaritan makes up the party, the &#8207;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206; [preparatory benediction before grace] must be said. But if things untithed have been eaten, or first tithes, of which the heave offering has not been taken, or consecrated things which have not been redeemed; or if the waiter has eaten [any quantity] less than the size of an olive [of that meal], or [if] an idolator [makes up the party] the &#8207;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206; is not to be said.</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. Women, slaves, and infants cannot be included in the number required for the &#8207;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206;. Which is [the smallest] quantity [of food that qualifies] for the &#8207;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206;? The size of an olive. R. Jehudah saith the size of an egg.</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. Which is the form of the &#8207;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206;? If three [form the party] he [who says grace] says, "Let us bless Him of whose gifts we have eaten." If three [form the party] besides himself, he says, "Bless ye Him," &amp;c. If ten [form the party] he says, "Let us bless our God," &amp;c. if ten, exclusive of himself, he says, "Bless ye our God," &amp;c. Whether there be ten or ten myriads&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the form of</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> &#8207;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206; remains the same. If there are exactly one hundred, he says, "Let us bless the Lord our God," &amp;c. if there are one hundred exclusive of himself, he says, "Bless ye the Lord our God," &amp;c. If there are one thousand, he says, "Let us bless the Lord our God, the God of Israel." If there are a thousand exclusive of himself, he says, "Bless ye the Lord our God, the God of Israel," &amp;c. If there are a myriad, he says, "Let us bless the Lord our God, the God of Israel, the God of hosts, who is enthroned amidst the cherubim," &amp;c. If there are a myriad exclusive of himself, he says, "Bless ye," &amp;c. &amp;c. And in the same manner as he pronounces the preparatory invocation, those who sit at the table make the responses. [Thus, for instance] they say, "Blessed be the Lord our God, the God of Israel, the God of hosts, who is enthroned amidst the cherubim, for the food we have eaten." R. Jos&eacute;, the Galilean, saith the [form of] invocation ought to be arranged according to the number of persons assembled; for it is said, Bless ye God in the congregations, the Lord, ye who spring from the fountain of Israel."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> R. Akivah saith, "How do we find it at the synagogue? whether there be many or few [assembled] the minister says, 'Bless ye the Lord.'" R. Ishmael saith, "Bless ye the Lord, who is ever blessed."</p>  
<p>&sect; 4. When three men have eaten together, they are not at liberty to separate [without joining in the &#8207;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206;]; neither may four or five, but six may [divide into two parties], and so may any number up to ten. But ten may not separate [without joining in the &#8207;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206;], nor may any number less than twenty, [who can again form two parties].</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. If two separate parties have dined in the same house, should some of each party be able to see some of the other company, they may join in the &#8207;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206;: but if they cannot so see each other, each party says the &#8207;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206; by itself. The blessing on the wine should not be said until it has been mixed with water. Such is the dictum of R. Eleazar; but the sages say the blessing may be said [without its being mixed].</p>
