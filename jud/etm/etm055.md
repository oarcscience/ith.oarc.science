*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER VIII.

§ 1. How are techoomin <span id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_228.md) to be
combined? A man places a cask \[of wine\], and says, "This is for all my
townsmen, for all who go to the house of mourning, and for all who go to
the house of feasting." Whosoever joins \[in the combination\] while it
is yet day-light \[on the eve of the day of rest\], is permitted \[so to
do\]; but after dusk it is prohibited, because the erub must not be
deposited after dark.

§ 2. How much is the legal quantity \[of food required to effect the
combination of techoomin\]? Food for two meals for every one \[who joins
therein\], for working-day meals, but not for Sabbath meals. Such is the
dictum of R. Meir; but R. Jehudah saith, "for Sabbath-meals, but not for
work-day meals." Both however intend to render the observance more
easy. <span id="fr_229"></span>[2](#fn_229.md) R. Jochanan ben Berokah
saith, "\[It is sufficient to effect the combination if there be\] a
loaf

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

for a *pundion*, when the price of four saah flour is one selah." <span
id="fr_230"></span>[3](#fn_230.md) R. Simeon saith, "two-thirds of a loaf
\[such as go\] three to the kab of flour." <span
id="fr_231"></span>[4](#fn_231.md) Half \[of such a loaf is the standard
time for remaining\] in the house of a leper; <span
id="fr_232"></span>[5](#fn_232.md) and the half of a half \[of such a loaf
of unclean food\] to make the body unclean. <span
id="fr_233"></span>[6](#fn_233.md)

§ 3. If the inhabitants of a court and the inhabitants of a gallery \[in
the court\] should have forgotten to join in erub, whatever is above ten
hands high \[from the ground\] is considered as belonging to the
gallery; and whatever is less than ten hands high \[from the ground\] is
to be considered as belonging to the court. The mould \[dug and heaped
up\] out of a ditch \[or trench\], or a stone, \[if either be\] ten
hands high, \[belongs\] to the gallery; \[but if\] less than this \[ten
hands high, it belongs\] to the court. When is this the case? \[If the
heap or stone be\] close \[to the gallery\], but \[if either be\]
separated \[therefrom\], even though it be ten hands high, \[it
belongs\] to the court. What is \[considered as\] close? Whatever is at
less distance than four hands.

§ 4. If a man deposit his erub \[for combining courts\] in a gateway
\[porter's lodge\], or in a hall \[entry\], or in a gallery, it is no
\[legal\] erub. Should any dwell there \[who has not joined in the
erub\], he cannot render the court unlawful \[to prevent the other
inmates to carry or convey therein\]. If a man deposit his erub in a
straw store, or in a stable, or in a wood-shed, or in a granary, it is a
\[legal\] erub; and he who dwells there renders the court unlawful \[if
he has not joined in the erub\]. R. Jehudah saith, "If the householder
has reserved to himself the right of keeping his utensils there \[in
such a loft, stable, shed, or granary\], he \[who dwells there\] does
not render the court unlawful."

§ 5. If a person quits his house, and goes to take his Sabbath-rest

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

in another town \[without joining in the erub\], whether he be a heathen
or an Israelite, he renders the court unlawful \[for the other inmates
to carry or convey therein\]. Such is the dictum of R. Meir. R. Jehudah
saith, "he does not render it unlawful." R. José saith, "a heathen
renders it unlawful, but an Israelite does not, as it is not the custom
of an Israelite to return on the day of rest." R. Simeon saith, "Even
though he has quitted his house, and is gone to take his Sabbath-rest
with his daughter, in the same town, he does not render \[the court\]
unlawful, since he has in thought renounced his habitation \[for the
time\]."

§ 6. If a cistern be between two courts it is not lawful to draw water
therefrom \[on the Sabbath\], unless there be a partition made ten hands
high, either above \[round the well\] or below \[within the water\], or
in the basin. R. Simeon hen Gamaliel saith, "Beth Shammai hold, \[the
partition must be made\] below \[within the water\];" but Beth Hillel
hold, "above \[round the well\]." R. Jehudah saith, "The partition is
not more effectual than the wall which is between them \[the two
courts\]."

§ 7. If a streamlet of water runs through a court, it is not lawful to
draw water therefrom, unless there be a partition ten hands high, where
it \[the streamlet\] flows in \[to the court\], and \[another\] where it
flows out \[again\]. R. Jehudah saith, "The wall above it is to be
considered a partition." R. Jehudah further said, "It so happened, that,
in \[the town of\] Ebal, they drew water from a streamlet on the
Sabbath, with the sanction of the elders;" but the sages replied,
"\[That was\] because it did not hold the legal size \[of a
carmelith\]." <span id="fr_234"></span>[7](#fn_234.md)

§ 8. If there be a balcony above the water <span
id="fr_235"></span>[8](#fn_235.md) it is not lawful to draw water
\[therein\] on the Sabbath, unless a partition be made ten hands high,
either above or below the balcony. So, likewise, if there be two
balconies, one above the other. Should a partition have been made for
the upper, but not for the lower one, it is unlawful to draw water from
either, unless they have been combined by erub.

§ 9. If a court be less than four amoth square, it is not lawful to pour
any water therein on the Sabbath, unless there be made a sewer capable
of holding two saah below the outlet, either outside of, or within, the
court. If \[however\] it \[the sewer\] be outside, it must be vaulted
\[over\]; whereas, inside, it needs not be vaulted \[over\].

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

\[§ 10. R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, "A kennel which is vaulted over, to
the extent of\] four amoth, in the public reshuth, it is lawful to pour
water into on the Sabbath;" but the sages hold that, even though the
court or the roof be one hundred amoth long, it is not lawful \[to pour
water direct\] down the kennel; but the water may be poured out on the
roof, so as to drop into the kennel. The entry \[hall\] may be added to
the \[court in computing the four amoth\] mentioned in the preceding
Mishna." <span id="fr_236"></span>[9](#fn_236.md)

§ 11. So, likewise, if there be two habitations facing each other \[in
one court\], and the inmates of the one \[habitation\] have made a
sewer, <span id="fr_237"></span>[10](#fn_237.md) but the inmates of the
other have not \[joined in making it\], those who made the sewer are
permitted \[to throw water down it\]; but those who made it not are
prohibited \[to throw water down it\]. <span
id="fr_238"></span>[11](#fn_238.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_228"></span>[88:1](etm055.htm#fr_228.md) Vide Introduction to
the present Treatise.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[88:2](etm055.htm#fr_229.md) Each of them
considers his quantum as the less: R. Meir, because the food for
working-days is coarse, of which no more is taken than just enough to
satisfy nature; R. Jehudah, because, on the Sabbath three meals are
taken, so that the quantity for each meal is smaller than on other days.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[89:3](etm055.htm#fr_230.md) A saah is equal to
six kab; the selah is four dinar; a dinar is six manah; the manah, two
pundion; and the pundion, two eesar; so that at this price, a loaf for a
pundion is equal to half a kab of flour; the kab is equal to twenty-four
eggs; the loaf, therefore, to twelve eggs.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[89:4](etm055.htm#fr_231.md) Equal to two-ninths
of a kab, or five and one-third eggs.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[89:5](etm055.htm#fr_232.md) Whosoever remains in
the house of a leper time sufficient to eat half such a loaf \[two and
two-thirds of an egg\], renders his clothes unclean, and must wash them.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[89:6](etm055.htm#fr_233.md) Whosoever eats of the
size of one-fourth such loaf \[one and one-third egg\], renders himself
unclean, and cannot partake of any thing consecrated till he has bathed.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[90:7](etm055.htm#fr_234.md) Vide Introduction to
Treatise Sabbath.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[90:8](etm055.htm#fr_235.md) With an aperture for
drawing water.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[91:9](etm055.htm#fr_236.md) Thereby to free the
inmates from the necessity of making a sewer.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[91:10](etm055.htm#fr_237.md) Vide § 9 of this
chapter.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[91:11](etm055.htm#fr_238.md) Unless they be
joined by erub.
