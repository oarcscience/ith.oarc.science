------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. A virgin is espoused on the fourth day \[of the week\], a widow on
the fifth; because in towns the Bethdin sits twice a week, \[namely\] on
the second and on the fifth \[day\], so that should he \[the
bridegroom\] have to complain of non-virginity, he \[presents himself\]
early \[the next morning\] before the Bethdin.

§ 2. \[If the person espoused is\] a virgin, her Ketubah is two

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

hundred dinar; \[if\] a widow, \[it is\] a maneh. <span
id="fr_784"></span>[2](#fn_779.md) A virgin \[who is\] a widow, or
divorced, or has performed chalitza, after betrothment \[only, the
marriage ceremony not having been completed, or the marriage
consummated, in all such cases\] their Ketubah is two hundred dinar, and
they are amenable to the accusation of non-virginity. <span
id="fr_785"></span>[3](#fn_780.md) A proselyte, a captive, and a bondwoman,
who have been ransomed, converted, or manumitted at less than three
years and one day \[old\], their Ketubah is two hundred dinar, and they
are amenable to the accusation of non-virginity.

§ 3. A minor, <span id="fr_786"></span>[4](#fn_781.md) with whom an adult
\[male\] has had carnal intercourse, a nubile maiden who has had such
intercourse with a minor, <span id="fr_787"></span>[5](#fn_782.md) and \[a
virgin\] fractured by accident, <span id="fr_788"></span>[6](#fn_783.md)
their Ketubah is two hundred dinar. Such is the dictum of R. Meir: but
the sages hold \[in the case of a virgin\] fractured by accident
\[that\] her Ketubah \[is only a\] maneh.

§ 4. A virgin \[who is\] a widow or divorced, or has performed chalitza
after espousals \[only, the ceremony having been completed, but the
marriage not consummated, in all such cases\] their Ketubah is a maneh,
and they are not amenable to the accusation of non-virginity. A
proselyte, a captive, and a bondwoman, who have been ransomed,
converted, or manumitted at more than three years and one day \[old\],
their Ketubah is a maneh, and they are not amenable to the accusation of
non-virginity.

§ 5. He who in Judea has partaken \[of the betrothment meal\] at his
father-in-law's without \[any\] witness \[present\], cannot prefer an
accusation of non-virginity, because he was alone with her <span
id="fr_789"></span>[7](#fn_784.md) \[the bride\]. A widow, whether she be
\[the daughter\] of an Israelite or of a priest has \[always\] her
Ketubah \[of\] a maneh. The sacerdotal

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bethdin fixed the
Ketubah for a virgin \[of sacerdotal race\] at four hundred zooz, but
the sages did not \[interfere to\] prevent them.

§ 6. He who espouses a wife, and discovers she has not her virginity,
should she say, "After thou didst betroth me ‏נאנסתי זנסתפחה שדך‎" <span
id="fr_790"></span>[8](#fn_785.md) while he replies, "No, it is not so, but
before I had betrothed thee \[thou hadst lost thy virginity\],
consequently my bargain \[with thee\] was concluded in error:" <span
id="fr_791"></span>[9](#fn_786.md) \[in his case\] R. Gamaliel and R.
Eleazar say, "She is worthy of belief;" but R. Joshua saith, "Not by her
assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to have been deflowered
previous to her betrothment, and that she deceived him, unless she
adduces proof to \[support her assertion\]."

§ 7. Should she assert, "I have been fractured by accident," while he
replies, "No, thou hast been deflowered by a man," R. Gamaliel and R.
Eleazar say, "She is to be believed;" but R. Joshua saith, "Not by her
assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to have been deflowered
by a man, unless she adduces proof to \[support\] her assertion."

§ 8. If she is seen conversing \[intimately\] with a man in the street,
and being asked, "Who is that man?" she replies, "He is A.B., a priest
\[or of legitimate Israelitish descent\]," R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar
say, "She is to be believed;" but R. Joshua saith, "Not by her assertion
are we to be guided: she is presumed to have been deflowered <span
id="fr_792"></span>[10](#fn_787.md) by a nethin or a bastard, <span
id="fr_793"></span>[11](#fn_788.md) unless she adduces proof to \[support\]
her assertion."

§ 9. If she is pregnant, and being asked, "by whom?" she replies, "By
NN., who is a priest," R. Gamaliel and R. Eleazar say, "She is to be
believed;" <span id="fr_794"></span>[12](#fn_789.md) but R. Joshua saith,
"Not by her assertion are we to be guided: she is presumed to be
pregnant by a nethin or a bastard, unless she adduces proof to
\[support\] her assertion."

§ 10. R. José said, "It \[once\] happened that a girl went down

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

to draw water from the fountain, and she was violated \[by a person
unknown\]." R. Jochanan ben Nouri decided, "That if the majority of the
townsmen were \[of pure descent and\] qualified to intermarry with the
sacerdotal race, this girl might be espoused by a priest."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_779"></span>[242:2](etm120.htm#fr_784.md) One hundred dinar;
the same proportion is observed whatever be the description of coin
named in the Ketubah.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[242:3](etm120.htm#fr_785.md) Vide Deut. xxii.
13–21. If sustained it deprives them of their Ketubah.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[242:4](etm120.htm#fr_786.md) A girl less than
three years and one day old.

<span id="fn_782"></span>[242:5](etm120.htm#fr_787.md) A boy less than nine
years and one day old.

<span id="fn_783"></span>[242:6](etm120.htm#fr_788.md) The expression of
the text is ‏מכת עץ‎, one struck by a tree or wood; it means a maiden
bruised or fractured \[from any cause other than coition\], so that the
signs of virginity have disappeared.

<span id="fn_784"></span>[242:7](etm120.htm#fr_789.md) In Judea the custom
was for the father-in-law to make a repast at the time of betrothing,
during which bride and bridegroom were left alone. This was done to
accustom them to each others society; but the law presumes that he
abused the opportunity, and therefore has no right to complain.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[243:8](etm120.htm#fr_790.md) A figurative
expression, denoting that her person (which is his possession) has
become defiled.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[243:9](etm120.htm#fr_791.md) If she was violated
subsequent to the betrothment, she does not forfeit her Ketubah; whereas
if it happened previously, her concealing it is held to be a fraud
practised upon him, the contract which he concluded in error becomes
void, and she forfeits her whole Ketubah.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[243:10](etm120.htm#fr_792.md) A striking instance
of the rigid seclusion to be observed by women in the East, and the
jealous suspicions to which they are subject.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[243:11](etm120.htm#fr_793.md) Vide Treatise
Yebamoth, ch. II., § 4, note 1.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[243:12](etm120.htm#fr_794.md) In which case she
and her child—if a daughter—might marry priests, which otherwise they
cannot do.
