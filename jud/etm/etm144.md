# XXIX. TREATISE KEDUSHIN,

###### OR, OF BETROTHING.

### <span class="smallcaps">Introduction</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">Under</span> this title, several laws relative
to the acquisition of a woman as a wife are mentioned. It is called
‏קדושין‎ from ‏קדש‎ "to consecrate, or set apart;" as by that act a
woman is "set apart," as it were, for her husband only. Several other
regulations, not immediately connected with the subject of the treatise,
are (as is usual in the Mishna) occasionally introduced.
