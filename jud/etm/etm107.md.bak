*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER III.

§ 1. When, of four brothers, two married two sisters, and they who had
married the sisters, died: the sisters must give *Chalitzah*, but may
not be married to the brothers-in-law by *Yeboom;* and if they had
prematurely <span id="fr_681"></span>[1](#fn_677.md) married them, they
must send them away. R. Eleazar saith, "According to Beth Shammai such a
marriage is valid; but according to Beth Hillel, they must be
separated." <span id="fr_682"></span>[2](#fn_678.md)

§ 2. If one of these sisters is prohibited to marry one of the brothers,
owing to a prohibited degree of relationship between them, <span
id="fr_683"></span>[3](#fn_679.md) \[although\] he may not marry her, yet
may he marry her sister, and both sisters are prohibited to the other
brother. If one of these sisters is prohibited only on account of legal
prohibition \[by the Rabbins\], or of holiness of station, <span
id="fr_684"></span>[4](#fn_680.md) she must perform *Chalitzah*, but he may
not marry her by *Yeboom*.

§ 3. When one of the sisters is prohibited to marry one brother, and
another sister the other brother, owing to prohibited degrees of
relationship between them, then she who is prohibited to one brother,
may marry the other; and this is the case to which allusion was made
\[above\] where \[it\] is said, "When, of two sisters, one only can be
\[lawfully\] married by *Yeboom*, she must either perform the ceremony
of *Chalitzah*, or be married by *Yeboom*." <span
id="fr_685"></span>[5](#fn_681.md)

§ 4. When, of three brothers, two were married to two sisters, <span
id="fr_686"></span>[5](#fn_681.md)

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

or to a mother and a daughter, or to a grandmother and her
grand-daughter, either her son's, or daughter's daughter, then these
women must perform *Chalitzah*, but cannot be married by *Yeboom*. R.
Simeon releases them from the obligation of *Chalitzah*. If any of these
could not be married \[to the third brother\] on account of prohibited
degree of relationship to him, he may not \[indeed\] marry her; but he
may marry her sister. If one of the sisters is prohibited to him, only
on account of legal prohibition \[by the Rabbins\], or on account of
holiness of station, she must perform *Chalitzah* to him, but he may not
marry her by *Yeboom*.

§ 5. When, of three brothers, two are married to two sisters, and the
third brother is unmarried, if one of the married brothers died, and the
single brother made a promise of marriage to the widow, and subsequently
the second brother died also, in this case, Beth Shammai teach, he must
keep his wife \[i.e. her to whom he promised marriage\], and the other
is as sister of his wife, released from the duty of *Chalitzah*; but
Beth Hillel decide, he must separate from his wife by *Get* and
*Chalitzah*, and from his sister-in-law by *Chalitzah*. To this case was
the remark applied: "Unhappy he, for \[the loss of\] his wife, and
unhappy he, for \[the loss of\] his sister-in-law." <span
id="fr_687"></span>[6](#fn_682.md)

§ 6. When, of three brothers, two are married to two sisters, and one to
a stranger: <span id="fr_688"></span>[7](#fn_683.md) if one of them who
married the sisters died, and the brother who had married the stranger
marries the widow, and then also dies, the first widow is released, as
sister of his wife and the second as her rival, but if he \[i.e. the
second deceased\] had only promised marriage to the widow, the stranger
must perform the ceremony of *Chalitzah;* but the brother-in-law may not
marry her by *Yeboom*. When, of three brothers, two married two sisters,
and the third a stranger: should the brother who married the stranger
die, and one of those who had married the sisters, marries the widow,
and also dies, the one widow is free, as being a wife's sister, and the
other as her rival; but if he only promised marriage to the stranger,
and then dies, she must perform *Chalitzah*, and may not be married to
her brother-in-law by *Yeboom*.

§ 7. When, of three brothers, two are married to two sisters,

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

and one to a stranger: if one of them who married the sisters died, and
he who had married the stranger marries the widow, and then the wife of
the second brother dies, and also the third brother, who had married the
stranger, then the widow will be for ever prohibited to the second, or
surviving brother, because she was for some time prohibited to him \[as
wife's sister\]. When, of three brothers, two were married to two
sisters, and one to a stranger, if it should happen that one of those
married to the sisters, divorced his wife; and that the brother married
to the stranger died, and the widow was married to the brother who gave
the divorce, and that this latter also died, then the following rule
becomes applicable: <span id="fr_689"></span>[8](#fn_684.md)—namely, that
in all cases where the husbands died, or when the woman had been
divorced, their rivals are permitted to marry.

§ 8. In all \[the mentioned fifteen classes <span
id="fr_690"></span>[9](#fn_685.md)\] where the Kedushin, or divorce, is
doubtful, the ceremony of *Chalitzah* must be performed by their rivals;
but these may not be married by *Yeboom*. What is meant by a doubtful
*kedushin* \[betrothment\]? When the man threw the marriage-bond, and it
is uncertain whether it fell nearest to him or to her, <span
id="fr_691"></span>[10](#fn_686.md) then it is a doubtful betrothment. A
doubtful divorce is,—when the husband did himself write the letter of
divorce, without the signature of witnesses, or that it was signed by
witnesses, but with the omission of date, or when it is properly dated,
but attested by one witness only,—then is it a doubtful divorce.

§ 9. When three brothers have married three strangers \[i.e. not related
to each other\], and one of the brothers died, and the second brother
promises marriage to the widow, and dies: <span
id="fr_692"></span>[11](#fn_687.md) the woman must perform *Chalitzah* to
the surviving brother, but he may not marry them by *Yeboom*, for it is
said (Deut. xxv. 5), "Her husband's brother shall go in unto her," &c.,
i.e. her who reverts to him by the death of one of his brothers, but not
her who reverts to him by the death of two brothers. R. Simeon saith,
"He may marry either, and must have the ceremony of *Chalitzah*
performed to him by the other." When, of two brothers married to two
sisters, one dies, and afterwards the wife of the surviving brother also
dies, then he may never marry his brother's widow; because, there was a
time

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

when she was prohibited to him, \[namely, during the life of his wife,
her sister.\]

‏שנים שקדשו שתי נשים. ובשעת בניסתן לחפה החליפו את של זה לזה ואת של זה
לזה. הרי אלו חיבים מאום אשת איש. ואם היו אחין. משום אשת אח. ואם היו
אחיות. משום אשה אל אחותה. ואם היו נדות. משום נדה. ומפרישין אותן שלשה
חדשים. שמא מעברות הן. ואם היו קטנות שאינן ראויות לילד. מחזירין אותן מיד.
ואם היו כהנות. נפמלו מן התרומה׃‎

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_677"></span>[206:1](etm107.htm#fr_681.md) There is another
reading of this part of our Mishna, in which the prohibition is
attributed to Beth Shammai, and the permission to Beth Hillel; as it is
generally the case that Beth Shammai prohibit, and Beth Hillel permit,
except in the cases mentioned in Treatise Eduyoth.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[206:2](etm107.htm#fr_682.md) *Ex. gr.* if she
happen to be his mother-in-law, &c.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[206:3](etm107.htm#fr_683.md) This is explained in
the preceding chapter.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[206:4](etm107.htm#fr_684.md) See the preceding
chapter.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[206:5](etm107.htm#fr_686.md) Namely, one brother
to one of the sisters, and another to the other sister.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[207:6](etm107.htm#fr_687.md) As would they say,
"He is to be pitied for losing thus, without any fault on his part, both
his wife and sister-in-law."

<span id="fn_683"></span>[207:7](etm107.htm#fr_688.md) By the word
"stranger" must be understood, a woman not in any way related to the
sisters before her marriage.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[208:8](etm107.htm#fr_689.md) See the preceding
chapter, § 10.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[208:9](etm107.htm#fr_690.md) See chap. I. § 1, of
this Treatise.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[208:10](etm107.htm#fr_691.md) Compare chap. VIII.
i 1, 2, 3, of Treatise Gittin.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[208:11](etm107.htm#fr_692.md) Before he
consummated the marriage.
