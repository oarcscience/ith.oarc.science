### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. From what time is the mention of God's power, as manifested in the
descent of rain, to be commenced \[in the prayers\]? R. Eleazar says
from the first day of tabernacles; R. Joshua says from the last day of
that festival: for said R. Joshua to \[R. Eleazar\], "Since the descent
of rain on the festival of tabernacles is to be considered an
unpropitious event, <span id="fr_516"></span>[1](#fn_513.md) why should it
be mentioned \[in the prayers\]?"

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> To this R. Eleazar
answered, "I also am not of opinion that they should be prayed
for, <span id="fr_517"></span>[2](#fn_514.md) but only that they should be
mentioned with the words, 'Thou causedst the wind to blow, and the rain
to descend in its proper time.'" "If so," replied R. Joshua, "this
mention might be made at all seasons of the year."

§ 2. Prayers for rain are not to be said sooner than shortly before the
commencement of the rainy season. R. Jehudah says, "The last <span
id="fr_518"></span>[3](#fn_515.md) of the ministers of the congregation who
on the last day of the feast of tabernacles officiates at the
reading-desk \[‏תיבה‎\], shall mention the rain, <span
id="fr_519"></span>[4](#fn_516.md) but not he who officiates first. <span
id="fr_520"></span>[5](#fn_517.md) On the first day of Passover the first
minister still mentions it, but not he who officiates last." <span
id="fr_521"></span>[6](#fn_518.md) Till how long is the rain to be prayed
for? R. Jehudah says till after the Passover; R. Meir says till the
month of Nissan is passed, because it is said \[Joel ii. 23\], "And he
will cause to come down for you the rain, the early rain and the late
rains in the first month."

§ 3. On the third of Mar-Cheshvan <span id="fr_522"></span>[7](#fn_519.md)
prayers for the rain are to be said, <span
id="fr_523"></span>[8](#fn_520.md) but according to Rabbon Gamaliel, on the
seventh of the same month, namely, fifteen days after the feast of
tabernacles, in order that the last Israelites might have reached the
river Euphrates. <span id="fr_524"></span>[9](#fn_521.md)

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

§ 4. If the seventeenth of Mar-Cheshvan has come without the rain having
yet descended, private individuals <span
id="fr_525"></span>[10](#fn_522.md) commence to keep three fast-days, <span
id="fr_526"></span>[11](#fn_523.md) on the preceding nights of which it is
lawful to eat and drink, to work \[on the fast-day\], to bathe, to
anoint the body, to wear \[leathern\] shoes, and to perform the marriage
duty.

§ 5. If the new moon of Kislev has arrived without the rain having yet
descended, the tribunal of justice \[‏בית דין‎\] shall order three
public and general fast-days, on which it is lawful to eat and drink on
the nights preceding them, to work \[on the days of the said fasts\] to
bathe, to anoint the body, to wear \[leathern\] shoes, and to perform
the marriage duty.

§ 6: When these have passed, without their prayers having been
favourably answered, the Beth Din shall decree three more public and
general fasts, on which it will be lawful to eat and drink on the nights
preceding them; but on which it is prohibited to work, to bathe, anoint
the body, wear \[leathern\] shoes, and to perform the marriage duty, the
\[public\] bathing places are also to be closed. Should these fasts also
have passed over without their prayers having been favourably answered,
the Beth Din shall decree seven more fast-days, which altogether make
thirteen public and general fasts, these last fasts differ from the
\[six\] preceding, inasmuch as on them an alarm is sounded \[on the
shophar\], and the shops remain closed, excepting that on Mondays,
towards the evening, the shop-shutters \[of those who sell articles of
food\] may be \[loosely\] leaned on \[that is, not fully closed, but in
a slanting position\], and on Thursdays, they may be entirely taken off,
in honour of the \[approaching\] Sabbath.

§ 7. When these have also passed without their prayers having been
favourably answered, they are to lessen or withdraw themselves from
engaging in joyful transactions, the erecting of buildings, and planting
of gardens for pleasure; from betrothings, weddings, and mutual
greetings, like men who are under the displeasure of the Almighty;
\[pious\] private individuals recommence fasting till the end of the
month Nissan. When Nissan has elapsed without <span
id="fr_527"></span>[12](#fn_524.md) rain

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

it must be considered as a curse, for thus it is written \[1 Sam. xiii.
17\], "Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the Lord, and he
shall send thunder and rain." <span id="fr_528"></span>[13](#fn_525.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_513"></span>[167:1](etm090.htm#fr_516.md) See Treatise Succah,
chap. II. § 9.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[168:2](etm090.htm#fr_517.md) That is, in express
terms, such as, "Grant that the rain may descend," &c., but only as it
were incidentally mentioned.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[168:3](etm090.htm#fr_518.md) Namely, he who reads
the ‏מוסף‎ \[Additional Service\]. See our eighth note page
[165](etm088.htm#page_165.md), Treatise Rosh Hashanah.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[168:4](etm090.htm#fr_519.md) That is, commence to
say in the prayers, ‏משיב הרוח ומוריד הגשם‎, "Causing the wind to blow
and the rain to descend."

<span id="fn_517"></span>[168:5](etm090.htm#fr_520.md) That is, he who
reads the ‏שחרות‎ \[Morning Prayers\], in the Amidah of which he is not
to mention about rain, \[‏משיב הרוח‎, &c.\]

<span id="fn_518"></span>[168:6](etm090.htm#fr_521.md) That is, ‏משיב הרוח‎
is still said in the Amidah of ‏שחרית‎, but not in the ‏מוסף‎ Prayer.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[168:7](etm090.htm#fr_522.md) The word ‏מר‎
\[Mar\] prefixed to the name of the month, is to denote the commencement
of the rainy season in Palestine, or because the word in signifies "a
drop."

<span id="fn_520"></span>[168:8](etm090.htm#fr_523.md) In Palestine the
prayer alluded to is that commencing ‏ברך עלינו‎, in which rain is
prayed for in express terms.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[168:9](etm090.htm#fr_524.md) This treats of
Israelites who used annually to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the
festivals, on the termination of which they returned to their homes out
of the Holy Land; prayers for rain were not said till fifteen days after
the festival, that they might have time to reach the Euphrates \[which
bounds Palestine towards the north\], without being hindered by the rain
on their homeward journey.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[169:10](etm090.htm#fr_525.md) Namely,
particularly pious individuals, not the general body of the nation.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[169:11](etm090.htm#fr_526.md) Namely, Monday,
Thursday, and the following Monday.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[169:12](etm090.htm#fr_527.md) This is translated
according to the text of the Mishna; but the corrected readings have
‏ואם וירדו‎ \[not ‏ואם ולא ירדו‎\], "If Nissan has elapsed and rain
falls," &c.: that this is the true reading, is evident from the text
adduced as proof, in which the Israelites are threatened *with a fall of
rain*.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[170:13](etm090.htm#fr_528.md) All the preceding
texts for rain, apply solely to the Holy Land, and countries of the same
climate.
