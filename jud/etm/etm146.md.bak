### CHAPTER II.

§ 1. A man may betroth a woman either personally or by his proxy, and a
woman may also be betrothed either personally or by her proxy. A father
may likewise betroth his daughter while she is a minor \[‏נערה‎\] either
personally or by his proxy. If a man said to a woman \[offering her
several dates at the same time\], "Be thou betrothed unto me with this
date"—"Be thou betrothed unto me with this." If among these dates there
is any single one worth a Prutha she is betrothed, but not otherwise;
but should he have said,

With this, and this, and this," she will be betrothed if all these dates
have the aggregate value of a Prutha, but not otherwise; but if,
meanwhile, she eat some of them, she will only then be betrothed if
among the last dates \[he gave her\] there was one worth a Prutha.

§ 2. \[Should a man say to a woman\] "Be thou betrothed unto me with
this cup of wine," and it was found to be honey, or if he said "honey,"
and it was found to be wine; or, "with this silver denarius," and it was
found to be a golden one; or, "with this golden one," and it was found
to be silver; or, "on condition that I am rich," and he was found to be
poor; or, "that I am poor," and it was subsequently ascertained that he
was rich, she is not betrothed. R. Simeon, however, says, "If the error
or deception was in her favor the betrothing is valid."

§ 3. If he said, "On condition that I am a priest," and the is a Levite,
or the reverse; "That I am a Netin," <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[1](#fn_1103.md) and he is found to be a bastard, or
the reverse; "That I live in a small town," and it is afterwards
discovered that he lives in a large town, or the reverse; "That my house
adjoins the public baths," and it is found situate remote from it, or
the reverse; "That I have a daughter or bondwoman who understands the
dressing of hair," and it was found that he had not such a one, or the
reverse; "That I have no children," and it is found that he has, or the
reverse: in all these cases the betrothing will be void, even though the
woman declares she was resolved to be betrothed to the man,
notwithstanding his misrepresentation. The above also applies in case
the misrepresentation proceeded from the woman.

§ 4. If a man says to his proxy, "Go and betroth for me the woman A.B.,
in the city C.," and he \[the proxy\] went and betrothed

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

her elsewhere, the betrothment is void; but if he only said, "She is in
the city C.," and the proxy betrothed her elsewhere, the betrothing is
valid. <span id="fr_1109"></span>[2](#fn_1104.md)

§ 5. If a man betrothed a woman on condition that she is not subject to
any vow, and afterwards ascertains that she is, the betrothment is void.
If he married her on the tacit understanding of the non-existence of
such vows, and they are found to exist, he may divorce her, and is not
bound to pay her the amount of her marriage contract. If \[he betrothed
her\] on condition that she has no bodily defects, and she was found to
have them, the betrothing is void. If he married her on a tacit
\[understanding of the non-existence of such defects\], he may divorce
her and is not bound to pay her the amount of her marriage contract. The
same corporeal blemishes which disqualify a priest <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[3](#fn_1105.md) do also disqualify females for
marriage.

§ 6. If a man betrothed two females with the value of a Prutha, <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[4](#fn_1106.md) or one woman with something of less
value than a Prutha, the betrothment is void, even though afterwards he
sent her many bridal presents, because these presents were only sent on
the \[supposed validity of the\] previous betrothment. It is even so
when a minor has thus betrothed a woman.

§ 7. If a person betrothed a mother and daughter at the same time, or
two sisters at the same time, the betrothment is void \[for either\]. It
happened once, that a man was gathering figs in a basket for five women,
two of whom were sisters. The figs did indeed belong to the
females, <span id="fr_1112"></span>[5](#fn_1107.md) but it was fruit of the
Sabbatical year. <span id="fr_1113"></span>[6](#fn_1108.md) The man said,
"All of ye shall be betrothed unto me with this." One of the females
went and accepted the basket for all the others. The sages then decided
"That the betrothment was void, as far as regarded the sisters."

§ 8. When a priest betrothes a woman with his share in the most holy
sacrifices, or with that of sacrifices sacred in a minor degree, the
betrothment is void. <span id="fr_1114"></span>[7](#fn_1109.md) Also,
according to R. Meir, "If he betrothed a woman either knowingly, or
through error, with his share in the second tithe." <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[8](#fn_1110.md) The betrothment is void, according to
R. Jehudah,

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

if he did it inadvertently, but valid, if he did it wilfully. <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[9](#fn_1111.md) If he used consecrated things, the
betrothment is valid, according to R. Meir, if he used them wilfully for
that purpose, but void, if he used them through inadvertence. R. Jehudah
saith, "If he used them through error, the betrothment is valid, but it
is void, if he used them thus wilfully."

§ 9. When a person uses for the purposes of betrothment fruits of
"Orlah," or "Kilaim" of the vineyards; or with an ox condemned to be
lapidated \[Exod. xxi. 29\]; or with a calf whose neck is to be struck
off \[Deut. xxi\]; or with the offering of birds of the leper; or with
the hair of a Nazarite; or with the firstling of an ass \[Exod. xiii.
13\]; or with meat boiled in milk; or with the flesh of animals
slaughtered for profane use in the temple-court: such betrothment is
void; <span id="fr_1117"></span>[10](#fn_1112.md) but if he sold the
mentioned articles, and used their proceeds for this purpose, the
betrothment is valid.

§ 10. When a person betrothes a woman with heave, or with tithe, or with
the oblations due to the priest, <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[11](#fn_1113.md) or with the waters of expiation, or
with the ashes \[of the red heifer\], she is duly betrothed, even when
tine man is an Israelite. <span id="fr_1119"></span>[12](#fn_1114.md)
