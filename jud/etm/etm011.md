*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# II. TREATISE PEAH.

\[Contains laws relating to the corner of the field to be left for the
poor (Levit. xxiii. 22, and Deut. xxiv. 19), and generally such laws as
relate to the rights of the poor on the soil of the Holy Land.\]

# III. TREATISE DEMAI.

\[Contains laws relating to such agricultural produce in the due
liquidation of tithes and heave offerings, of which the payment is
doubtful.\]

N.B. It must be remarked, that the Mishna nowhere confines itself to the
subject only of which it professes to treat; but that remarks and
opinions are occasionally introduced, bearing no reference to the
subject which precedes or succeeds them.
