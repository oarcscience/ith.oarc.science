*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER III.

§ 1. It is prohibited to catch fish from ponds on the festival, or to
feed them on that day; <span id="fr_431"></span>[1](#fn_430.md) but it is
lawful to catch wild animals or fowls in enclosed parks or aviaries, and
to provide them with food. <span id="fr_432"></span>[2](#fn_431.md) Rabbon
Simeon, son of Gamaliel, says, "All fish-ponds and enclosures are not
\[to be considered in\] the sane \[light\], this is the general rule: if
the fish or animals therein require \[on account of its extent\], to be
chased, or some device to be used, in order to take them, they may not
be taken on the festival; but it is lawful to take them if they do not
require such pursuit or device to be used." <span
id="fr_433"></span>[3](#fn_432.md)

§ 2. It is unlawful to take on the festival from nets which have been
spread on the previous day, any fish, wild animal, or fowl, which may
have become entangled therein, unless it is known

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

that they had been caught in the nets previous to the commencement of
the festival. It once happened that a heathen brought, on the festival,
a present of fish to Rabbon Gamaliel; when the latter said, "It is
lawful to use them, but I do not wish to accept presents from that man."

§ 3. It is unlawful to kill on the festival any animal labouring under a
mortal disease, unless there is time to eat thereof on that day, the
\[*minimum*\] quantity of the size of an olive of roasted meat; Rabbi
Akivah allows it, if there be only sufficient time to eat thereof a
piece of the size of an olive of raw meat, even in the very place in
which it is slaughtered. If it had been killed in the fields, the whole
\[carcase\] may not be carried home on a staff or stick, but piecemeal,
by hand.

§ 4. If a first-born animal <span id="fr_434"></span>[4](#fn_433.md) fall
into a pit or hole on the festival, \[and the owner is afraid it should
die there\], R. Jehudah says, "An expert person must go down, and see
whether it had \[already\] an incurable and permanent injury, in which
case, it may be drawn up and killed, but not otherwise." Rabbi Simeon
says, "If the defect or injury had not been known \[for *certain*\] to
exist thereon, previous to the festival, and to be of a permanent
nature, the animal cannot be considered as *prepared* for the feast."

§ 5. An animal \[consecrated for sacrifice\] which had died on the
festival, may not be removed thereon. It happened once, when Rabbi
Tarphon was questioned on the subject, and also concerning a separated
piece of dough \[‏חלה‎\] which had become polluted, he went to the ‏בית
המדרש‎ \[college of the Rabbins\] and enquired: they told him, "They may
not be removed from the spot."

§ 6. An association for the purpose of jointly purchasing an animal, may
not be formed on the festival; but if it was made before the festival,
the animal so purchased may be slaughtered and shared on the festival.
Rabbi Jehudah says, "It is lawful to weigh meat against a vessel or
hatchet;" <span id="fr_435"></span>[5](#fn_434.md) but the sages say it is
unlawful to use the scales at all. <span id="fr_436"></span>[6](#fn_435.md)

§ 7. Knives may not be ground or set on the festival; but it is

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

lawful to sharpen one knife with the other. It is not allowed to say to
a butcher, "Weigh, or sell me for a denar’s <span
id="fr_437"></span>[7](#fn_436.md) worth of meat," but \[the butcher\] has
the animal killed, and shares it among <span
id="fr_438"></span>[8](#fn_437.md) \[his customers\].

§ 8. One person may say to another \[on the festival\], "Fill me this
vessel," but it must not be a vessel appropriated to measure with. R.
Jehudah says, "If a measure is used, it must not be quite filled." Abba
Saul, the son of Botnit, used to fill his measures on the day before the
festival, and delivered them to his customers on the festival; Abba Saul
says, "He used to do so even on the middle-days, <span
id="fr_439"></span>[9](#fn_438.md) on account of the froth in the
measure;" <span id="fr_440"></span>[10](#fn_439.md) the sages say he even
did so on week-days, in order to let out the entire contents of his
measure into the vessels of his customers. <span
id="fr_441"></span>[11](#fn_440.md) It is lawful to go to a shop-keeper,
with whom one is used to deal, and to say to him, "Give me so many
\[mentioning the number\] eggs or nuts," because the master of a house
is used to count similar articles by number.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_430"></span>[149:1](etm081.htm#fr_431.md) Because they may
without injury be left for a day without being fed.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[149:2](etm081.htm#fr_432.md) Because they are
dependant on man for food.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[149:3](etm081.htm#fr_433.md) That is, when in
small ponds, aviaries, or enclosures where they may easily be taken, and
are considered as ‏מוכן‎ prepared for the festival.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[150:4](etm081.htm#fr_434.md) This treats of a
first-born animal which had some bodily injury, but which had not yet
been shown to expert persons to decide whether the injury was permanent
and incurable, in which case it was not consecrated, and might be used.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[150:5](etm081.htm#fr_435.md) After the festival
the vessel or hatchet is weighed, and the meat paid for accordingly, but
it is not lawful to use the ordinary weights on the festival.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[150:6](etm081.htm#fr_436.md) Even to keep meat
in, or for a similar purpose.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[151:7](etm081.htm#fr_437.md) An ancient coin, a
denarius.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[151:8](etm081.htm#fr_438.md) But neither money
nor weight may be mentioned or used in the transaction.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[151:9](etm081.htm#fr_439.md) Because he was
engaged all day in the study of the law with those who came to celebrate
the festival.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[151:10](etm081.htm#fr_440.md) Being exceedingly
scrupulous, he used to fill his measures, and let them remain all night,
that the froth might subside, and in the morning he filled them up with
wine, that his customers might have their full measure of wine.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[151:11](etm081.htm#fr_441.md) When he sold oil he
used to let his measure drain all night into the vessel or utensil of
his customer, that not a drop might adhere to the sides or bottom of his
own measure.
