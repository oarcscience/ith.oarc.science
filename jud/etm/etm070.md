# XVI. TREATISE YOMAH,

###### OR, THE DAY OF ATONEMENT.

### INTRODUCTION.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> first seven chapters treat of the
manner in which the day of atonement <span
id="fr_352"></span>[1](#fn_352) was celebrated in the second temple; the
different sacrifices brought on that day, the preparation of the high
priest for his ministry, and the order of service, as he performed it,
entering fully into minute details of every circumstance connected
therewith. The eighth chapter treats of the general observance of the
day, with respect to fasting, penitence, &c., and the rules and
regulations thereunto appertaining. As the precepts contained in the
first seven chapters are at present in abeyance, the eighth chapter only
has been translated.
