### CHAPTER III.

§ 1. He who introduces his hands into a house that is smitten <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[1](#fn_1300) \[with leprosy, thereby causes\] his
hands \[to become unclean in a\] primary <span
id="fr_1306"></span>[2](#fn_1301) \[degree\]. Such is the dictum of R.
Akivah; but the sages

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

decide, "\[He causes\] his hands \[to become unclean in a\]
secondary <span id="fr_1307"></span>[3](#fn_1302) \[degree\]." Whatever
renders garments unclean <span id="fr_1308"></span>[4](#fn_1303) at the
time of \[coming into\] contact therewith, causes the hands to become
unclean \[in a\] primary degree. Such is the dictum of R. Akivah; but
the sages decide, "\[It causes the hands\] to become \[unclean in a\]
secondary \[degree\]." They \[the sages, moreover\] said to R. Akivah,
"When do we ever find \[that\] the hands \[become unclean in a\] primary
\[degree\]?" He answered them, "How is it possible that they \[the
hands\] can become \[unclean in a\] primary \[degree\] unless the whole
body has \[previously\] become unclean, except in the present
instance." <span id="fr_1309"></span>[5](#fn_1304) Articles of food, and
vessels which have become unclean through liquids, cause the hands to
become unclean \[in a\] secondary \[degree\]. Such is the dictum of R.
Joshua; but the sages decide, "That which is become unclean through an
Ab Hatoomah <span id="fr_1310"></span>[6](#fn_1305) makes the hands
unclean; \[but that winch is become\] unclean through a Ab
Hatoomah <span id="fr_1311"></span>[7](#fn_1306) does not make the hands
unclean." R. Simeon ben Gamaliel said, "It happened that a woman came
before my father, and stated to him, 'My hands got into the empty space
of an \[unclean\] earthen vessel:' he asked her, 'My daughter, from what
\[cause\] did the uncleanness arise?' but I did not hear what she said
to him." The sages replied, "The case is clear; <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[8](#fn_1307) that which is become unclean through
an Ab Hatoomah makes the hands unclean, \[but that which is become
unclean\] through a Ab Hatoomah does not make the hands unclean."

§ 2. Whatever disqualifies heave <span id="fr_1313"></span>[9](#fn_1308)
causes the hands to become

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[unclean in a\]
secondary \[degree\]. One hand makes the other hand unclean. Such is the
dictum of R. Joshua; but the sages decide, "That no secondary can make a
secondary." <span id="fr_1314"></span>[10](#fn_1309) R. Joshua
\[objected and\] said to them \[the sages\], "Are not sacred scriptures
secondaries, and \[nevertheless they do\] make the hands unclean?" <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[11](#fn_1310) \[But\] they answered him, "The
commandments of the \[written\] law cannot be subjected to conclusions
drawn from the dicta of the Sopherim \[scribes\], nor these dicta to
those commandments, nor yet dicta of the Sopherim to others of their
dicta."

§ 3. Leather straps of Tephilin, with the Tephilin \[attached thereto\]
make the hands unclean. R. Simeon saith, "The straps of Tephilin do not
make the hands unclean."

§ 4. The margin in a book of the Law, at the top and at the bottom, at
the beginning and at the end \[thereof\], makes the hands unclean. R.
Jose saith, "\[The margin\] at the end does not make the hands unclean
until the roller is attached to it."

§ 5. A book \[of the Law, in\] which \[the writing\] is obliterated, but
which still contains eighty-five letters, \[a number\] equal to the
Parasha ‏ויהי בנסוע הארון‎, <span id="fr_1316"></span>[12](#fn_1311)
makes the hands unclean. Any Megillah <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[13](#fn_1312) which contains eighty-five letters,
\[a number\] equal to the above named Parasha, makes the hands unclean.
All sacred scriptures make the hands unclean. <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[14](#fn_1313) The Canticles and Ecclesiastes make
the hands unclean. R. Jehudah saith, "Canticles make the hands unclean,
but Ecclesiastes is \[subject to\] a dispute \[difference of opinion\]."
R. José saith, "Ecclesiastes does not make the hands unclean, but the
Canticles are \[subject to\] a dispute." R. Simeon saith, "Ecclesiastes
is one of \[those observances in which\] Beth Shammai \[are\] less
strict, and Beth Hillel more rigid." <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[15](#fn_1314) R. Simeon ben Azai said, "I have it
as a tradition from the mouths of seventy-two elders, on the day they
inducted R. Eleazar ben Azariah into the president's seat, that
Canticles and Ecclesiastes \[both\] make

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

the hands unclean." R. Akivah said, "Mercy forbid! no man in Israel ever
disputed that the Canticles make the hands unclean, as the whole
\[history of the\] world does not \[offer an epoch\] equal to the day on
which the \[book\] Canticles was given to Israel; for all the Kethoobim
\[Hagiographers\] are holy, but the Canticles are holy of holies. The
dispute \[in question, therefore,\] referred to Ecclesiastes \[only\]."
R. Jochanan ben Joshua, the son of R. Akivah's father-in-law, said,
"Even as Ben Azai stated, so was the dispute, and so was \[also\] the
decision."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1300"></span>[360:1](etm167.htm#fr_1305) Vide Leviticus
xiv. 33–48.

<span id="fn_1301"></span>[360:2](etm167.htm#fr_1306) So as by their
touch to render Cholin \[common food\], unfit for use; to render heave
unclean, and what comes into contact therewith unfit for use; to <span
id="page_361">p. 361</span> render sacred things and what comes into
contact therewith unclean, and whatever touches the last named unfit for
use.

<span id="fn_1302"></span>[361:3](etm167.htm#fr_1307) Which only renders
unfit for use in heave, but renders such sacred things unclean as come
in direct contact therewith.

<span id="fn_1303"></span>[361:4](etm167.htm#fr_1308) Such as the
spittle or discharge of a person having a running issue \[menorrhagia\].

<span id="fn_1304"></span>[361:5](etm167.htm#fr_1309) Because the hands
only having been introduced into the house smitten with leprosy, the
rest of the body remains clean.

<span id="fn_1305"></span>[361:6](etm167.htm#fr_1310) ‏אב הטמאה‎, the
parent stock, or generator of uncleanness; whatever contains the
principle of uncleanness in itself, and does not derive it from any
other object, but communicates it to whatever comes in contact
therewith, as a human corpse, a dead reptile, &c. (Vide Treatises
Oholoth, Negaim, and Mikvaoth.)

<span id="fn_1306"></span>[361:7](etm167.htm#fr_1311) ‏ולד הטמאה‎, the
offspring or product of uncleanness; whatever does not contain the
principle of uncleanness in itself, but has derived or contracted it
from some other object. (Vide Treatises Kelim, Taharoth, and Ukzin.)

<span id="fn_1307"></span>[361:8](etm167.htm#fr_1312) R. Gamaliel's
question as to the nature of the uncleanness supports and confirms our
decision.

<span id="fn_1308"></span>[361:9](etm167.htm#fr_1313) So that it becomes
Cholin and must not be eaten by priests.

<span id="fn_1309"></span>[362:10](etm167.htm#fr_1314) One object
unclean in a secondary degree cannot cause another object, with which it
comes in contact, to become unclean in the same degree.

<span id="fn_1310"></span>[362:11](etm167.htm#fr_1315) One of the
eighteen decisions adopted the day Beth Shammai had the majority (Vide
Treatise Sabbath, chap. 1.) is, that whoever touches the sacred
scriptures disqualifies heave until his hands are washed.

<span id="fn_1311"></span>[362:12](etm167.htm#fr_1316) Numbers x. 35,
36. The rabbies consider these two verses as forming a distinct book of
the Law.

<span id="fn_1312"></span>[362:13](etm167.htm#fr_1317) A parchment roll,
containing a portion of the sacred scriptures.

<span id="fn_1313"></span>[362:14](etm167.htm#fr_1318) So as to
disqualify heave. (Vide note 11 of this chapter.)

<span id="fn_1314"></span>[362:15](etm167.htm#fr_1319) Contrary to the
usual practice of these two great schools.
