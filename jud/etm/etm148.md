*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER IV.

§ 1. Ten kinds of families went up from Babylon \[to Palestine, with
Ezra, at the building of the second temple\], viz. 1, priests; 2,
Levites; 3, Israelites; 4, profaned; 5, proselytes; 6, freedmen; 7,
bastards; 8, Netinim; 9, of unknown lineage; and 10, foundlings.

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The three first
mentioned may intermarry. Levites, Israelites, profaned proselytes, and
manumitted slaves may intermarry among themselves; and the last
mentioned six may also intermarry among themselves.

§ 2. Of unknown lineage are all those whose mother is known, but not
their father. A foundling \[‏אסופי‎\] is one who was picked up in the
streets, and knows neither father nor mother. Abba Saul used to call one
of unknown lineage \[‏שתוקי‎\] "a ‏בדוקי‎," i.e. one subject to
examination. <span id="fr_1136"></span>[1](#fn_1131.md)

§ 3. All that are prohibited to enter the congregation \[of the Lord\]
may intermarry; but R. Jehudah prohibits it. R. Jehudah says, "Those
whose prohibition is certain, may intermarry; but not those whose
prohibition is certain, with those whose prohibition is doubtful, or the
doubtful with the certainly prohibited, or the doubtfully prohibited,
among each other. Doubtfully prohibited are those of uncertain lineage,
foundlings, and Samaritans." <span id="fr_1137"></span>[2](#fn_1132.md)

§ 4. A priest, who intends to marry a priest's daughter, must previously
make inquiry <span id="fr_1138"></span>[3](#fn_1133.md) in respect to four
mothers \[i.e. the mother and grandmothers of his intended wife\], which
four \[are in fact\] eight, <span id="fr_1139"></span>[4](#fn_1134.md) viz.
1, the bride's mother; 2, her maternal grandmother; 3, the mother of her
mother's father; 4, the mother of the last mentioned; 5, her father's
mother; 6, the mother of the latter; 7, the mother of the paternal
grandfather; and 8, the mother of the last mentioned. And when he
intends marrying a Levite's or an Israelite's daughter, he must make
inquiries for yet another degree.

§ 5. These inquiries are not necessary in respect to a priest who had
ministered at the altar, or to a Levite who had officiated at the
‏דוכן‎, or choir in the temple, or of an Israelite who had been a member
of the Sanhedrin, and of all those whose ancestors were known to have
held high public offices, or had been appointed wardens or overseers of
the poor; all these are qualified to marry in priest's families without
any previous examination. R. José says, "Also

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

those whose name is to be found signed as a witness in the ancient
archives of the tribunal of Zepporis." <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[5](#fn_1135.md) R. Hanina ben Antigonus saith, "Also
he whose name is inscribed among the royal army." <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[6](#fn_1136.md)

§ 6. The female descendants of a desecrated priest are for ever
disqualified to be married to the priesthood. An Israelite married to a
profaned woman, their daughter is qualified to marry a priest; but the
daughter of a desecrated priest married to an Israelitess, is
disqualified to marry a priest. R. Jehudah saith, "The daughter of a
male proselyte is even as the daughter of a desecrated priest
\[disqualified to be married to a priest\]."

§ 7. R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, "The daughter of an Israelite who had
married a female proselyte, is qualified to be married to the
priesthood; and the daughter of a male proselyte who had married an
Israelite woman is also qualified; but not the daughter of a male
proselyte married to a female proselyte. This applies to proselytes and
to manumitted slaves, even to the tenth generation, and is in force till
the mothers of these are Israelites." R. José is of opinion, "That even
the daughter of a proselyte who had married a female proselyte, is
qualified to be married to the priesthood."

§ 8. A father who says, "This son of mine is a bastard," is not to be
believed: even should both parents admit that the child in the womb of
the female is a bastard, they are not to be believed; but, according to
R. Jehudah, their assertion is to receive credence.

§ 9. When a man empowered a deputy to conclude for him the betrothing of
his daughter, and did subsequently betroth her himself to another man,
if his betrothment was first, it is valid, but if the betrothing through
the deputy had preceded that by the father, that of the deputy is alone
valid; and when it cannot be ascertained which betrothing was prior,
both husbands must give her Get, or, if they

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

should thus agree, one may give her Get, and the other may marry her;
and, in like manner, when a woman empowers a deputy to conclude a
betrothing for her, and she betrothed herself subsequently \[to another
man\], if her betrothing was the first, hers is valid, but if that by
the deputy was prior to hers, then that alone is valid; and when it
cannot be ascertained which betrothment was the first, both husbands
must give her Get, or, if they thus agree, one may give her Get, and the
other may marry her.

§ 10. When a husband and wife departed to a distant country beyond sea,
and he returns with her, and with children, and says, "This is the same
wife that went away with me, and these are her and my children," he need
not bring any further proof as to the legitimacy of either wife or
children; if he says, "My wife died \[abroad\], and these are her
children," he must prove the legitimacy of the children, but is not
required to prove that of the wife.

§ 11. Should he say, "I married a woman abroad, this is she, and these
are her children," he must prove the legitimacy of the wife, but need
not prove that of the children. Should he say, "The wife I married
\[abroad\] is dead, and these are her \[and my\] children," he must
produce proof of the legitimate descent of both wife and children.

§ 12. A man ought not to be in a secluded place alone with two women,
but one woman may be alone with two men; R. Simeon saith, "A man may be
alone with two women, if his wife is with him, and may sleep with them
at the same inn, <span id="fr_1142"></span>[7](#fn_1137.md) because his
wife guards him;" a man may, however, be alone with his mother or
daughter, and even sleep together, but when they are full grown they may
only sleep together when both are dressed.

§ 13. An unmarried man should not keep school, <span
id="fr_1143"></span>[8](#fn_1138.md) nor should a woman do so; <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[9](#fn_1139.md) R. Eleazar saith, "Also, he whose wife
is not with him."

§ 14. R. Jehudah says, "An unmarried man should not tend \[or pasture\]
cattle, nor should two unmarried men sleep together under the same
coverlet;" but the sages permit both. <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[10](#fn_1140.md) All men whose

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

business leads them to be much in the company of females, should avoid
being alone with them; nor should any one have his son apprenticed to a
trade which is to be exercised exclusively among females; R. Meir saith,
"A person should always endeavour to have his son taught a light and
respectable business, and pray \[for success\] to Him to whom belongeth
all riches and property; since there is no trade among whom there are no
poor as well as rich, and neither riches nor poverty are derived from a
trade alone, <span id="fr_1146"></span>[11](#fn_1141.md) but all depends
upon personal merit and moral worth;" R. Simeon ben Eleazar saith,
"Didst thou ever see any animal or bird exercise any trade or
handicraft? and yet they are maintained without trouble or care; they
were created to serve me; would it not follow, that I, who was created
for the sole purpose of worshipping my Creator, should also find my
maintenance without trouble, if it were not that, through my evil
conduct, I have forfeited my maintenance?" Abba Goryom, from Zadyan,
said \[in the name of Abba Guryah\], "A person should not bring up his
children to be ass or camel drivers, barbers, mariners, shepherds, or
shopkeepers, for these are not honest trades." <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[12](#fn_1142.md) R. Jehudah says \[in the name of Abba
Guryah\], "Most of the ass drivers are wicked persons, but the greater
part of the camel drivers are generally honest; most mariners are pious;
the best of physicians is destined for hell, <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[13](#fn_1143.md) and the best butcher is a suitable
companion for Amalek." <span id="fr_1149"></span>[14](#fn_1144.md) R.
Nahorai saith, "I leave every business, and have my son only taught the
Holy Law, for its rewards are partly enjoyed here, but the principal
reward is reserved, to those who occupy themselves therein, in the
future world. It is not thus with other \[worldly\] trades, for when a
man engaged in them becomes

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

ill, or old, or suffers from other woes, and cannot longer work at them,
he must perish of hunger. Not so the law, for it preserves a man from
evil in his youth, and in hoary age it holds out to him the best hopes
and expectations \[of a glorious futurity\]. In respect to his period of
youth, it is said, <span id="fr_1150"></span>[15](#fn_1145.md) 'But they
that trust in the Lord shall have renewed strength;' and regarding the
period of old age, it is said, <span id="fr_1151"></span>[16](#fn_1146.md)
'They shall still bloom in old age, they shall be full of sap and
verdant;' and thus it is said concerning the patriarch Abraham, <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[17](#fn_1147.md) 'Abraham was old, and God had blessed
Abraham in all things.' We find also that Abraham our father observed
the whole law, even before it was given, for thus it is said, <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[18](#fn_1148.md) 'Because that Abraham obeyed my voice
and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[317:1](etm148.htm#fr_1136.md) His mother was
examined whether his father belonged to one of the three first mentioned
classes.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[317:2](etm148.htm#fr_1137.md) Samaritans are now
considered as non-Israelites in every respect.

<span id="fn_1133"></span>[317:3](etm148.htm#fr_1138.md) Whether any of
these had been married to unqualified persons, otherwise the sons born
in such marriage would be disqualified priests.

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[317:4](etm148.htm#fr_1139.md) Viz. four on the
mother's, and four on the father's side. This inquiry is only then
necessary when the reputation of the bride's family is impugned; and
even in that case the assertion of the females themselves, though
unsupported by extraneous evidence, is held to be sufficient.

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[318:5](etm148.htm#fr_1140.md) Because that
tribunal was known to make strict inquiries into the character of
witnesses. This passage \[in the original ‏בערכי הישנה של צפורי‎\] has
been variously explained. Some understand the word ‏חישנה‎ to be the
name of a place near Zippori, and ‏ערכי‎ public registrars of
genealogical lists. But the denoting ‏ה‎ prefixed to the word ‏ישנה‎, as
also the word ‏של‎, which shews it to be in regimen, afford, in our
opinion, sufficient proof that our rendering is the more probable one.
It appears to have been also thus understood by Maimonides. (See his
Commentary, *ad loc.*)

<span id="fn_1136"></span>[318:6](etm148.htm#fr_1141.md) Original
‏באסטרטיא‎, from the Greek "Strateia," or host. It is unlikely, however,
that all the soldiers should be of good family; it is, therefore,
supposed to apply here only to the royal body guards, which were
selected from the best families.

<span id="fn_1137"></span>[319:7](etm148.htm#fr_1142.md) Or rather a
caravansary, where all sleep together in the same room.

<span id="fn_1138"></span>[319:8](etm148.htm#fr_1143.md) The reason is
stated to be, that, as the mothers of the scholars frequently come to
visit them, it may not give occasion for calumny and scandal, either
regarding him or them.

<span id="fn_1139"></span>[319:9](etm148.htm#fr_1144.md) Not to lose her
reputation by the visits of the fathers of her scholars.

<span id="fn_1140"></span>[319:10](etm148.htm#fr_1145.md) The Halacha, or
decision, is against R. Jehudah, because Israelites are not to be
suspected of the commission of so horrid a crime as ——.

<span id="fn_1141"></span>[320:11](etm148.htm#fr_1146.md) Because they
generally only enable men to gain a bare livelihood, or, as it is
sometimes said, "To live to work, and to work to live."

<span id="fn_1142"></span>[320:12](etm148.htm#fr_1147.md) Those who follow
the five first-mentioned trades \[which are mean ones\] are suspected of
pilfering the property of others in the fields, roads, and other
unfrequented places, where their business leads them; also not to keep
faithfully their agreement with their employers.

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[320:13](etm148.htm#fr_1148.md) Because they are
supposed not to be piously inclined, and, in the cure of diseases, to
trust too much to their skill; according to others, because they do not
sufficiently sympathise with the pains of their fellow-creatures, and
will neglect a poor patient, and prove the cause of his death, in order
to attend to their own interest in waiting on a rich patient, &c. It is
almost needless to say, that all the above are not laws, but merely the
expressions of private opinions.

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[320:14](etm148.htm#fr_1149.md) Because it is
supposed that his habits of shedding the blood of animals renders him
cruel towards men, like that blood-thirsty nation the Amalekites.

<span id="fn_1145"></span>[321:15](etm148.htm#fr_1150.md) Isaiah lx. 31.

<span id="fn_1146"></span>[321:16](etm148.htm#fr_1151.md) Ps. xcii. 9.

<span id="fn_1147"></span>[321:17](etm148.htm#fr_1152.md) Gen. xxiv. 1.

<span id="fn_1148"></span>[321:18](etm148.htm#fr_1153.md) Gen. xxvi. 5.
