### CHAPTER XVIII.

§ 1. Man may move even four or five kupoth <span
id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_157) of straw or grain \[to make room\] for
guests, or to enable disciples to obtain instruction in the law; but
\[he must\] not \[move\] an entire store. \[The following articles\] may
\[likewise\] be removed: clean heave-offering, <span
id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_158) doubtful fruit, <span
id="fr_159"></span>[3](#fn_159) first tithes, of which the
heave-offering has been taken, second tithes, and consecrated things
which have been redeemed, and dried broad-beans \[as these last\] are
food for the \[‏עניים‎\] poor. \[According to another version (‏עזיים‎)
goats.\] But it is not lawful to move ‏טבל‎, <span
id="fr_160"></span>[4](#fn_160) nor first-tithes of which the
heave-offering has not been taken; nor second-tithes, nor consecrated
things which have not been redeemed; nor yet arum, <span
id="fr_161"></span>[5](#fn_161) nor mustard. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel
permits arum to be moved, as it is food for \[tame\] ravens.

§ 2. Bundles of straw, bundles of stalks, and bundles of reeds, if
intended as fodder for cattle, may be moved; if not, they must not be
moved. A basket may be set on end for chickens to climb up and down on;
a runaway hen may be chased back \[home\] again; calves and young asses
may be walked \[to and fro to take exercise\] in the public reshuth; a
woman may also walk her child. R. Jehudah saith, "When \[may she do
this\]? If it \[the child\] lift up one \[leg\] as it sets the other
down; but if it trails \[its leg behind\] it is prohibited \[for the
mother\] to walk \[lead\] her child, \[on the Sabbath\]."

§ 3. A man must not deliver \[of its young\] an animal that calves on
the festival; but he may \[otherwise\] support \[assist\] it. \[If\] a
woman is to be delivered on the Sabbath, the midwife must be called in
to her from one place to another. The Sabbath may be violated for her
sake; the navel-string is to be tied; R. José saith, "it may also be
cut." Whatever is necessary for \[appertains to\] circumcision, may be
done on the Sabbath.
