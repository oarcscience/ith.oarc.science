*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. The prohibition to carry or convey \[from one reshuth <span
id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67.md) into another\] on the Sabbath, is twofold;
which \[according to the decision of the sages\], form four
\[prohibitions for him who is\] inside \[of the reshuth\]; and also
twofold which \[according to the decision of the sages\], form four
\[prohibitions for him who is\] outside \[of the reshuth\]. How is this
to be understood? A mendicant stands outside \[of the private
property\], and the master of the house inside \[of it\]: <span
id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_68.md) should the mendicant put his hand in \[to
the private reshuth\], and \[either\] put \[his wallet\] into the
master's hand, or take something out of it \[the master's hand into his
own\], and draw his hand back, \[into the public reshuth, in which he is
standing\], the mendicant is guilty, but the master of the house is
absolved. Should the master stretch out his hand \[into the public
reshuth in which the mendicant is standing,\] and put \[his gift\] into
the hand of the mendicant, or take \[the wallet\] out of it, and draw
his hand back \[into the house or private reshuth in which he is\], the
master of the house is guilty, but the mendicant is absolved. Should the
mendicant put his hand in, and the master take \[the wallet\] out of it,
or put \[his gift\] into it, and the mendicant \[then\] draw his hand
out, both are absolved. Should the master stretch out his hand, and the
mendicant take \[the gift\] out of it, or put \[his wallet\] into it,
both are absolved. <span id="fr_69"></span>[3](#fn_69.md)

§ 2. A man is not to sit down to the barber, near the time of ‏מנחה‎
until he has said his prayers; <span id="fr_70"></span>[4](#fn_70.md) nor
must man \[about that

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

time on the Sabbath-eve\] visit the bath, or the tan-yard; he must not
sit down to his meal, nor yet in judgment; but if he have begun \[to do
either\] he needs not leave off. \[The study of the Law\] is to be
interrupted for the Shemang, but not for the Tephilah. <span
id="fr_71"></span>[5](#fn_71.md)

§ 3. The tailor must not go out with his needle near dusk \[on the
Sabbath-eve\], lest he forget and carry it out with him \[during the
Sabbath\]. The scribe \[writer\] is not to go out with his writing-reed
\[pen\]; nor must a man cleanse his garments of vermin, or read by
candle-light \[on the Sabbath-eve\]. They \[the sages\] have indeed
permitted \[that\] a teacher may superintend children, who are reading
\[by candle-light\], but he \[himself\] must not read. From the same
motive \[to avoid the possible occasion to sin\] a man afflicted with a
running issue, must not take his meals with a woman afflicted with the
same disease. <span id="fr_72"></span>[6](#fn_72.md)

§ 4. The following are among the decisions enacted in the Upper Hall of
Hananiah, the son of Hezekiah, the son of Giorion, when they \[the
sages\] went thither, and went up to visit him. On that occasion the
sages present were counted, and \[the sages of\] the school of Shammai
were found to be more numerous than \[those of\] the school of Hillel.
On that day eighteen enactments were decreed.

§ 5. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to soak the materials for making
ink, or drugs for dying, or vetch \[to feed cattle\] \[on the
Sabbath-eve\], unless there be time sufficient to soak it through,
during the day \[before the Sabbath comes in\]: but Beth Hillel permit
it.

§ 6. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to put bundles of flax into the
oven \[on the Sabbath-eve\], unless there be time sufficient to steam
\[dry\] them during the day; nor to put wool into the dye-kettle, unless
there be time sufficient for the wool to imbibe the dye during the day
\[before the Sabbath comes in\]: all of which Beth Hillel permit. Beth
Shammai declare it unlawful to spread \[set\] nets for game, fowl, or
fish \[on the Sabbath-eve\], unless there be time sufficient for it to
be caught therein during the day \[before the Sabbath comes in\]: but
Beth Hillel permit it.

§ 7. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to sell any thing to a heathen
\[on the Sabbath-eve\], or to help him to load, or to load for him,
unless there be time sufficient for him to reach a neighbouring

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

town \[or village\] during the day \[before the Sabbath comes in\]: but
Beth Hillel permit it.

§ 8. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to deliver skins to a heathen
tanner, or clothes to a heathen laundress \[on the Sabbath-eve\], unless
there he time enough for them to be got ready during the day \[before
the Sabbath comes in\]: all of this Beth Hillel permit to be done, while
the sun remains above the horizon.

§ 9. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "It was the custom in my father's
house, to deliver white garments to the heathen laundress three days
before Sabbath." \[Both schools\] agree, that it is permitted to put
blocks on the oil-press, and the round logs on the wine-press near the
coming in of the Sabbath\]. <span id="fr_73"></span>[7](#fn_73.md)

§ 10. Neither meat, onions, nor eggs, must be fried \[on the
Sabbath-eve\], unless there be time sufficient for them to get quite
done during the day \[before the Sabbath comes in\]. Bread must not be
put into the oven towards dusk \[nightfall\] on the Sabbath-eve, nor
cakes on the coals, unless there be time enough for the surface to
become crusted during the day \[before the Sabbath comes in\], R.
Eleazar saith \[unless there be time sufficient for\] the bottom to
become crusted.

§ 11. It is permitted to put the paschal offering into the oven towards
dusk on the Sabbath-eve <span id="fr_74"></span>[8](#fn_74.md) And the
priests \[in the Temple\] may stir the fire a little in the
hearth-room, <span id="fr_75"></span>[9](#fn_75.md) but in other halls \[of
the Temple\] only if there is time sufficient for the fire to seize on
the greater part of the wood. R. Jehudah saith of coals, "if any part of
them be ignited \[before the Sabbath come in\]."
