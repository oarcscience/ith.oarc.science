### CHAPTER VII.

§ 1. When a widow who \[unlawfully\] married a high-priest, or a
divorced woman, or one who had given *Chalitzah*, had been \[also
unlawfully\] married to an ordinary priest, and brought their husbands
\[as a marriage portion\] the *usufructum* of slaves ‏עבדי מלוג‎, <span
id="fr_709"></span>[1](#fn_704.md) or of slaves which are as an iron
flock, <span id="fr_710"></span>[2](#fn_705.md) ‏עבדי צאן ברזל‎: the
first-mentioned slaves may not eat of the heave, but the last-mentioned
slaves may eat thereof. The term "*usufructum* slaves," denotes, that
the loss of these slaves by death, or the profit that may accrue from
them by their increase, are entirely at the risk, or for the advantage
of the wife; and, therefore, although the husband is bound to maintain
them, yet they may not eat of his heave-offering. Slaves which are as an
"iron flock," are such, whose death is the husband's loss, or their
increase his profit; and as he has thus the entire risk of them, they
may eat of the heave-offering \[as if they had been bought by him\].

§ 2. When an Israelite woman marries a priest, to whom she brought
slaves as her marriage portion, the said slaves may eat of the heave,
whether they are *usufructum* slaves, or \[as the so called\] iron
flock; but if a priest's daughter was married to an Israelite, and
brought him slaves, whether in *usufruct* or as an iron flock, they may
not eat heave.

§ 3. When a priest, who had married an Israelite woman, dies, leaving
her pregnant, her \[iron flock\] slaves may not eat of the heave, on
account of the share \[or interest\] the yet unborn child of

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

the priest has \[in the inheritance of his father\], and the heave
belongs to the heirs \[of the priest <span
id="fr_711"></span>[3](#fn_706.md)\]; because an unborn priest's child may
indeed disqualify a person to eat of heave, <span
id="fr_712"></span>[4](#fn_707.md) but cannot confer the right to give
slaves to eat thereof. Such is the dictum of R. Josh; but the sages
argued against this, and said unto him, "\[If so\] even as you affirm
this in respect to an Israelite woman married to a priest, thus also,
even if she were a priest's daughter married to a priest, and had been
left pregnant by him at his decease, ought also not to be allowed to eat
of the heave, on account of the share of the unborn infant?" \[Because
the slaves are the property of the unborn infant as being the heir; and,
according to R. José, an unborn child cannot confer a right to give
slaves to eat of consecrated heave\].

§§ 4 &5. \*      \*      \*      \*  
           \*      \*      \*      \*

§ 6. A high-priest may occasionally disqualify \[his grandmother to eat
of the heave\], as in the following instance:—when a priest's daughter
was married to an Israelite, and bore him a daughter, which daughter
married a priest, and had a son by him,—that son will be qualified to be
a high-priest, and to minister as such at the altar; he qualifies his
mother \[at the death of his father\] to eat of the heave, but
disqualifies his maternal grandmother, who may well pray that "there be
not many in Israel like my grandson the high-priest, who disqualifies me
from eating of the heave-offering."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_704"></span>[215:1](etm110.htm#fr_709.md) That is, the
property remains vested in the wife, but the husband has, during the
marriage, the use of their services; the term ‏מלוג‎, plucking \[of
poultry\], is here frequently used to describe *usufructum* goods of
which a person has the risk; like a person who contracts to pluck the
geese of another person, the former has a right only in the feathers,
whether much or little, at the risk of the plucking, but has no property
in the geese. This term ‏נכסי מלוג‎ will in future be rendered by us,
"*usufructum* goods."

<span id="fn_705"></span>[215:2](etm110.htm#fr_710.md) Under this term must
always be understood here, a sum, the value of which is immoveably
fixed: namely, If a husband receives certain goods, which in the
*Ketubah* are valued at a certain sum, that sum, and neither more or
less, he is to return, in case of death or divorce, whether he lost or
gained by them, and under any circumstances. The term "iron flock,"
arose from the circumstance of its being usual, in the time of the
Mishna, to entrust flocks to a shepherd, at a certain valuation, and at
the shepherds entire risk; so that if, through whatever cause, the flock
was lost or deteriorated, the shepherd was bound to pay the whole amount
valued.

<span id="fn_706"></span>[216:3](etm110.htm#fr_711.md) For only after a
priest's child is born, can he confer a right to give the slaves to eat
of the heave.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[216:4](etm110.htm#fr_712.md) Such as a priest's
daughter, who, at the death of her Israelite husband, was left pregnant.
