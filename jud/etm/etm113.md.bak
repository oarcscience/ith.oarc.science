### CHAPTER XI.

§ 1. A man may lawfully marry the near relatives of a woman whom he has
violated or seduced, <span id="fr_731"></span>[1](#fn_726.md) but he who
has either violated or seduced the near relatives of his wife, has
become guilty of incest. A man may marry a woman who had been violated
or seduced by his father, or one who had been thus treated by his son.
R. Jehudah prohibits a son to marry a woman who had been violated or
seduced by his father.

§ 2. When the sons of a female proselyte have adopted the Jewish faith
at the same time with their mother \[and one of them dies without
issue\], his brother is not bound to *Yeboom*, nor to receive
*Chalitzah* \[from the widow of his deceased brother\]. <span
id="fr_732"></span>[2](#fn_727.md) Even when the first was conceived before
she participated in the holiness \[of the Jewish community\], but was
born under the Holy covenant, and that the other brother was both
conceived and born under the Holy covenant. The same regulation applies
to a bondwoman whose children were manumitted along with her.

§ 3. When the sons of five women have become intermixed with each other
\[and each woman has another son, of whose identity she is certain\],
when these mixed sons have grown up, married, and died \[without
issue\], then four of the surviving brothers shall cause the widow of
one to perform *Chalitzah* to them, and the fifth brother may marry the
widow; then shall he and three other brothers receive *Chalitzah* from
another widow, whom another brother may marry by *Yeboom* \[and in the
same manner with the remainder\], so that each of these widows must
perform the ceremony of *Chalitzah* four times, and can then be married
by *Yeboom*.

§ 4. When the son of a woman has become interchanged with that of her
daughter-in-law \[and each of them has another son, or sons, besides\],
which sons grew up, married, and died \[without issue\], then the other
sons of the widowed daughter-in-law shall receive *Chalitzah* \[from one
widow\] but may not marry her by *Yeboom*, because it is doubtful
whether she was his brother's wife or that of

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

his father's brother; but the sons of the grandmother may either marry
her by *Yeboom*, or receive *Chalitzah*, because the doubt in this case
is only whether she was wife of his brother, or of his brother's son;
but if the sons whose descent is undoubted die, then those of doubtful
descent who were interchanged, must have the ceremony of *Chalitzah*
performed to them by the widow of the grandmother's son, but may not
marry her by *Yeboom*, because it is doubtful whether she is the
brother's wife or that of his father's brother, the widowed
daughter-in-law need only perform the ceremony of *Chalitzah* to one of
those who were interchanged, and may then marry the other by *Yeboom*.

§ 5. When the son of a woman married to a priest, was interchanged with
that of her bondwoman, both \[sons\] may eat of the heave, but when both
happen to present themselves at the same time at the threshing-floor,
they shall receive but one share of the heave; they may not defile
themselves with a dead body, and may not marry women who are either
qualified or disqualified to be married to a priest. <span
id="fr_733"></span>[3](#fn_728.md) But when they have attained their
majority, and have mutually manumitted each other, they may marry the
women only who are qualified to be married to the priesthood, and may
not defile themselves with a dead body; but if they did so, the forty
stripes are not to be inflicted on them. They may not eat heave, but if
they did eat it, they need not pay back the principal \[of the value
they had eaten\], and an additional fifth, nor has either of them a
share \[in the division of heave among the priests\] at the
threshing-floor, but they are allowed to sell their own heave, and keep
the money themselves. <span id="fr_734"></span>[4](#fn_729.md) They have no
share of the consecrated things of the Temple; <span
id="fr_735"></span>[5](#fn_730.md) consecrated things are not given to
them, <span id="fr_736"></span>[6](#fn_731.md) nor are these consecrated
things exacted from them. They are, moreover, not bound to give the
shoulder, the two cheeks, and maw of their own offering to the priests.
Their first-born cattle must be left to pasture, till they contract a
legal blemish, and with respect to their sacrifices, the most stringent
regulations in force in respect to that <span
id="fr_737"></span>[7](#fn_732.md) of priest and Israelites, are to be
applied to them.

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

§ 6. If a woman who did not wait three months \[to re-marry\] since the
death of her husband \[or since her divorce\], should marry within that
time, and has a son born unto her of whom it is doubtful whether he was
a nine months’ child by the first husband, or a seven months’ child by
the second; if she had other sons by the first and second husbands, then
these sons must, in case of the decease \[without issue\] of their
brother, to whose birth doubt attached, receive *Chalitzah* from his
widow, but may not marry her by *Yeboom*; and he also may only receive
*Chalitzah* from any of his brother's widows, but may not marry them by
*Yeboom*; but if he had half-brothers, either of her first or second
husband, who are not sons of his mother, he may in that case <span
id="fr_738"></span>[8](#fn_733.md) either receive *Chalitzah* of his
brother's widow, or may marry her by *Yeboom*. In respect to his
brothers, one of them must \[in case of his death without issue\]
receive *Chalitzah* from his widow, and then may another brother marry
her by *Yeboom*.

§ 7. If one \[of the two husbands of the said woman\] is an Israelite,
and the other a priest, the son may only marry a woman qualified to be
married to the priesthood. He may not defile himself with a dead body;
but if he did so, the punishment of forty stripes is not to be inflicted
on him; neither may he eat of the heave; but if he did so, he is not
bound to pay the value of the principal and an additional fifth part. He
also shall not receive a share of the priestly oblation at the
threshing-floor; he may sell his own heave, and keep the money for
himself. He has no share in the consecrated things of the Temple, nor
shall consecrated things be given to him; yet, those belonging to
himself cannot be claimed, or exacted from him \[by the priests\]. He is
also free from the payment of the two cheeks, the shoulder, and maw of
his own sacrifice \[to the priests\]; and his firstborn cattle must be
left to pasture till it contracts a legal blemish, and the most
stringent regulations \[regarding sacrifices\] of priests and
Israelites, are to be applied in respect to his sacrifices. If both
\[the husbands of his mother\] were priests, he is bound \[in case of
death\] to mourn for them, and they for him; he may not defile himself
with their dead bodies, nor may they defile themselves with his; he is
no heir to them, but they inherit his property. The punishment attached
to the crime of striking, or cursing a father, cannot be inflicted on
him. <span id="fr_739"></span>[9](#fn_734.md) He may serve in the priests'
division of

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

service at the Temple, of one and of the other, but he does not
participate in the share of either, but if both belonged to one division
\[‏משמרה‎\], he is entitled to one share.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_726"></span>[222:1](etm113.htm#fr_731.md) Such as her mother,
daughter, or sister, because as there was no lawful marriage there
cannot be the guilt of incest incurred by connexion with her relatives.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[222:2](etm113.htm#fr_732.md) Because their
relationship dated from a time when the Mosaical law was not binding
upon them.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[223:3](etm113.htm#fr_733.md) Because those that
are qualified may not be married to a slave, and those that are
disqualified may not be married to a priest. All this applies only
during the minority of these two sons.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[223:4](etm113.htm#fr_734.md) They need not give
it to any priest.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[223:5](etm113.htm#fr_735.md) Such as the skins of
the animals sacrificed, which were shared among the priests.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[223:6](etm113.htm#fr_736.md) Such as the
first-born of cattle, &c.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[223:7](etm113.htm#fr_737.md) This applies more
particularly to the meat-offering.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[224:8](etm113.htm#fr_738.md) When there are no
other brothers.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[224:9](etm113.htm#fr_739.md) In case he
transgressed with either father in that respect, when he has the <span
id="page_225">p. 225</span> benefit of the doubt; but should he strike
or curse both fathers at the same time, he is guilty, inasmuch as it is
certain that his real father is one of the two.
