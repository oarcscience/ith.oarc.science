### CHAPTER IV.

§ 1. In transporting jars of wine from one place to another, on the
festival, care must be taken not to remove them in a basket or
case, <span id="fr_442"></span>[1](#fn_441.md) but they must be removed on
the shoulder, and carried in front of the person; <span
id="fr_443"></span>[2](#fn_442.md) and if any one should thereon carry any
straw, he must not carry it in a basket over his shoulder, but must
carry it in his hand. It is lawful to commence taking, on the festival,
of a heap of straw \[to burn\], but not of the pieces of wood lying in
the yard behind the house.

§ 2. Wood may not be taken from a shed, but the pieces adjoining it
\[i.e. loosely placed against it\] may be used; it is lawful also to

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

fetch it from a wood-stack in a field, and from a wood-store, and even
to gather the dispersed pieces of wood therein. What constitutes a
store? R. Jehudah says, "When it is near the city, and is enclosed."
Rabbi José says, "When it is entered by a door that can be locked, even
if it should be situated at the extreme end of the ‏תחום‎, or Sabbatical
limit."

§ 3. It is not permitted to cut wood from new beams, nor from an old
beam which happened to break on the festival, neither may wood \[allowed
to be used\] be cleft on the festival with an axe, saw, or billhook, but
with a chopping-knife only; when there is a hole in the brick-walls of a
place used to store fruit in, <span id="fr_444"></span>[3](#fn_443.md) it
will be lawful to remove the fruit from that open part: but Rabbi Meir
says, "It is even lawful to remove the bricks to get at the fruit, and
to remove it."

§ 4. It is not permitted to make a cavity in a lump of potter's clay for
the purpose of using it as a lamp, because a utensil is thereby formed;
neither may charcoal be made on the festival, nor the wick of a lamp be
cut in two. R. Jehudah says, "When the ends have been placed in two
lamps, it is allowed to separate them by burning the middle part."

§ 5. It is not permitted to break pieces of earthenware <span
id="fr_445"></span>[4](#fn_444.md) on the festival, or to cut paper to be
placed over salted fish while it is broiled; <span
id="fr_446"></span>[5](#fn_445.md) neither may the fallen mortar be removed
on that day from the oven, but it is lawful to press it close. Two
barrels may not be brought near each other to be used as a trivet to
place a pot on them over the fire, neither may a piece of wood be used
for the purpose of supporting a pot or a door; <span
id="fr_447"></span>[6](#fn_446.md) nor may cattle be driven on the festival
with a stick: but R. Eleazar, son of Simeon, permits it.

§ 6. Rabbi Eleazar says, "A person may take a splinter from the wood
lying near him, to clean his teeth with, and gather in the yard small
pieces of wood and burn them, because whatever is in the yard may be
considered as ‏מוכן‎ prepared for the festival." But the sages

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

allow those pieces only to be picked up which lay near to a person, and
for the purpose of burning them only.

§ 7. Fire may not be produced on the festival from wood, <span
id="fr_448"></span>[7](#fn_447.md) stones, <span
id="fr_449"></span>[8](#fn_448.md) dust, or earth, <span
id="fr_450"></span>[9](#fn_449.md) or from water; <span
id="fr_451"></span>[10](#fn_450.md) neither is it lawful to heat tiles to
broil food thereon. Rabbi Eleazar also said, "A person may place himself
on the eve of the Sabbath, in a seventh or Sabbatical year, <span
id="fr_452"></span>[11](#fn_451.md) in the places where figs or raisins are
kept, and say, From these will I eat to-morrow." But the sages say he
must point out the exact spot, and say, "I will take from here till
there."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_441"></span>[151:1](etm082.htm#fr_442.md) Many at a time as on
working days.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[151:2](etm082.htm#fr_443.md) That is, a few at a
time, and in a manner different from the usual mode.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[152:3](etm082.htm#fr_444.md) The Mishna treats
here of a store, or enclosed place, whose walls consist of loose bricks,
without mortar or lime.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[152:4](etm082.htm#fr_445.md) Used anciently to
place under fish, &c. that it might not be burned, and adhere to the
metal pan in which they were cooked.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[152:5](etm082.htm#fr_446.md) According to some
commentators, it refers to an ancient practice of wrapping the salt fish
to be broiled in papers steeped in oil, or according to others, in
water, to prevent the burning of the fish.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[152:6](etm082.htm#fr_447.md) The permission to
use wood on the festival being given only for the purpose of preparing
food, i.e. as fuel, it may not be used for any other purpose.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[153:7](etm082.htm#fr_448.md) By friction and
rubbing two pieces against each other, as is done by the American
savage.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[153:8](etm082.htm#fr_449.md) By striking hard
stones with steel, &c.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[153:9](etm082.htm#fr_450.md) There are some soils
covering subterraneous fires, or containing so much sulphur and
inflammable substance, that they will spontaneously ignite, particularly
on being stirred with a spade, &c.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[153:10](etm082.htm#fr_451.md) This is explained
by Bartenora, and other commentators of the Mishna, as being effected by
means of the sun's rays on a crystal vessel filled with water, probably
a burning lens, but the means by which the water was ignited is not
mentioned, nor is it probable that the water itself was ignited at all;
perhaps it was used as a lens to collect the rays of the sun. Maimonides
(chap. IV. of Treatise Yom Tob, in Yad Hachazaka, vol. 1) seems to be
doubtful on this subject, and explains it as referring to the volatile
parts of naphtha floating on water, which, by agitation in the sun's
rays, will enflame and light tinder, &c.; but it is by no means
intelligible what the Mishna here *really* means.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[153:11](etm082.htm#fr_452.md) In which there is
no tithe to be separated.
