------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER III.

§ 1. With all kinds of nutriment the erub or junction may be effected,
except with water and salt. All \[kinds of nutriment\] may be bought for
the proceed of the second tithe, except water and salt. He who has vowed
\[to abstain\] from food, is permitted \[to partake\] of salt and of
water. The erub may be made for a nazir <span
id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_192.md) with wine, and for a \[common\]
Israelite <span id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_193.md) with heave-offering.
Symmachus saith, "that ‏חולין‎ <span id="fr_194"></span>[3](#fn_194.md)
\[only must be used\] for \[the erub of a common\] Israelite. The erub
of a cohen <span id="fr_195"></span>[4a](#fn_195.md). \[may be placed\] on
a spot which has formerly been used as a cemetery." R. José saith, "it
may even \[be placed\] in an actual burying-ground, since he \[the
cohen\] may go and eat it outside \[the burying-ground\].

§ 2. For the erub demai <span id="fr_196"></span>[5a](#fn_196.md) may be
used: first, tithes from which the heave-offering has been taken; and,
second, tithes and consecrated things that have been redeemed; and for
priests, ‏חלה‎, <span id="fr_197"></span>[6](#fn_197.md) and
heave-offering.

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But it is not
lawful to use ‏טבל‎, <span id="fr_198"></span>[7](#fn_198.md) or first
tithes, from which the heave-offering has not been taken; or second
tithes, and consecrated things which have not been redeemed. Should any
one send his erub by the hand of a deaf and dumb person, of an idiot, of
a minor, or of one who does not acknowledge \[the legal validity of\]
the erub, <span id="fr_199"></span>[8](#fn_199.md) it is not a \[legal\]
erub: but if he has commissioned another \[proper\] person to receive it
from \[his messenger\], it is a \[legal\] erub.

§ 3. If a man puts it \[the erub\] in a tree higher than ten hands from
the ground, his erub is no \[legal\] erub; \[but if he puts it\] lower
than ten hands, his erub is a \[legal\] erub. If he has put it into a
pit, even though that be a hundred amoth deep, his erub is a \[legal\]
erub. Should he put it on the top of a cane, or pole, that does not
actually grow out of the ground, but is only stuck therein, even though
it be a hundred amoth high, his erub is a \[legal\] erub. If he has put
it into a cupboard, which he locked, and has lost the key, it is a
\[legal\] erub. R. Eleazar saith, "If he does not know where the key is,
it is not a \[legal\] erub." <span id="fr_200"></span>[9](#fn_200.md)

§ 4. Should the erub roll \[or be moved\] out of the limit \[of the
Sabbath distance\], or should a heap \[of mould\] fall on it, or should
it be burned, or if heave-offering get unclean, \[if either of all these
take place\] while yet day, \[before the Sabbath comes in\], it is not a
\[legal\] erub; \[but if it take place\] after dusk, it is a \[legal\]
erub. If \[the time when it took place is\] doubtful, R. Meir and R.
Jehudah say, "This is \[at once driving\] an ass \[and leading a\]
camel." <span id="fr_201"></span>[10](#fn_201.md) R. José and R. Simeon
say, "A doubtful erub is good \[in law\]." R. José further said,
"Abtolymus attested, on the authority of five elders, that a doubtful
erub is good \[in law\]."

§ 5. A man may attach conditions <span id="fr_202"></span>[11](#fn_202.md)
to his erub, and say, "If foes

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

come from the east, my erub \[shall stand good\] for the west; <span
id="fr_203"></span>[12](#fn_203.md) \[if they come\] from the west, my erub
\[shall stand good\] for the east; should they come from both sides, I
\[am at liberty to\] go in what direction I please; should they not come
from either side, I am like \[the rest of\] my townsmen; should a sage
come from the east, my erub \[shall stand good\] for the west; <span
id="fr_204"></span>[13](#fn_204.md) \[should one come\] from the west, my
erub \[shall stand good\] for the east; \[should one\] come from each
side, I \[am at liberty to\] go in which direction I please; \[should\]
none \[come\] from either side, I am like the rest of my townsmen." R.
Jehudah saith, "If one of them \[the two sages who come\] has been his
teacher, he must go to meet his teacher; but if both have been his
teachers, he goes in which direction he pleases."

§ 6. R. Eleazar saith, "When a festival follows next to a Sabbath,
whether before or after it, a man prepares two erubin, and he may say,
'My first erub \[is to stand good\] for the east, and the second for the
west; or the first for the west, and the second for the east. My erub
\[is to stand good for\] the first \[day\]; and the second \[day I am\]
like my townsmen; or my erub \[is to stand good for\] the second
\[day\], but the first \[day I am\] like my townsmen.'" But the sages
hold, "that he can \[only\] prepare his erub for one direction, or it
does not stand good at all; \[likewise\] that he must prepare his erub
for both days, or it does not stand good at all. But how must we do? He
carries it \[the erub\] out \[to the place where he means to deposit
it\] on the \[eve of\] the first \[day of rest\], and remains with it
until dusk, when he carries it \[back with him\]. He then brings \[the
erub\] out again on the second \[day\], remains with it till dark, and
then eats it. It is found \[that thus\] he gains his walk \[beyond the
Sabbath-limit\], and he gains by \[eating\] his erub. Should he eat
\[his erub\] on the first \[day\] it is a \[legal\] erub for the first
\[day\], but is not a \[legal\] erub for the second \[day\]." R. Eleazar
said, "\[Thus\] ye acknowledge to me that they are two \[distinct\]
holy-days." <span id="fr_205"></span>[14](#fn_205.md)

§ 7. R. Jehudah saith, "If a man apprehends that the new year will be
celebrated two days, <span id="fr_206"></span>[15](#fn_206.md) he must
prepare two erubin." He then

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

says, "My erub of the first \[day\] \[shall stand good\] for the east,
and of the second \[day\] for the west; or of the first \[day\] for the
west, and the second for the east. My erub \[shall stand good\] for the
first \[day\], and on the second \[day\] I am like my townsmen; or my
erub \[shall stand good\] for the second \[day\], but on the first \[I
am\] like my townsmen:" but the sages did not coincide with him.

§ S. R. Jehudah further said, "A man may conditionally fix \[select\]
\[the heave-offering of\] a basket of fruit on the first day of the new
year \[festival\], and eat it on the second \[day\]; <span
id="fr_207"></span>[16](#fn_207.md) so, likewise, an egg which is laid on
the first \[day\] may be eaten on the second:" but the sages did not
coincide with him.

§ 9. R. Dosa ben Harkeenass saith, "He who stands before the
reading-desk \[to pray\] on the first holy day of the Rosh-ashanah, must
say, 'Strengthen \[support\] us, O Lord our God, on this day of the new
moon, whether to-day or to-morrow \[be the true one\].' And on the
morrow he says \[the same prayer, with the variation\], 'whether this
day or yesterday \[be the true one\]:'" but the sages did not coincide
with him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_192"></span>[75:1](etm050.htm#fr_192.md) A nazir, by his vow,
must abstain from wine. (Vide Num. vi. 3).

<span id="fn_193"></span>[75:2](etm050.htm#fr_193.md) Whosoever is not a
cohen, or Levite, is a common Israelite, and must not partake of holy
food. (Vide Lev. xxii. 10). The erub here in question is the combining
of limits, for to that or courts bread is indispensable.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[75:3](etm050.htm#fr_194.md) Things not
consecrated.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[75:4a](etm050.htm#fr_195.md) A priest, descendant
of Aaron.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[75:5a](etm050.htm#fr_196.md) Vide chap. I. § 10,
note 4 of this Treatise.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[75:6](etm050.htm#fr_197.md) The first offering of
the dough. (Vide Num. xv. 17, and Treatise Chalah).

<span id="fn_198"></span>[76:7](etm050.htm#fr_198.md) Vide Treatise
Sabbath, chap. XVIII. § 1, note 1.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[76:8](etm050.htm#fr_199.md) Any of the numerous
sectarians who did not acknowledge the authority of tradition and of the
oral law.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[76:9](etm050.htm#fr_200.md) The locks in question
were formed out of leather thongs, which might be cut through if the key
was lost. The doing of this R. Eleazar considers unlawful on the day of
rest.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[76:10](etm050.htm#fr_201.md) The ass a man drives
before him, and the camel he pulls along from behind him; so that he
needs have his eyes both before and behind. It is a proverbial
expression, denoting, that a man is hemmed in all ways. Its application
in the present instance arises from the circumstance, that the erub
prevents him who prepared it from going in any other direction, while
the doubt of its legality prevents his enjoying its privilege, so that
it actually becomes penal.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[76:11](etm050.htm#fr_202.md) He must, however,
deposit a separate club in each of the two directions.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[77:12](etm050.htm#fr_203.md) To fly from them.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[77:13](etm050.htm#fr_204.md) To meet and welcome
him.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[77:14](etm050.htm#fr_205.md) Consequently two
erubin are admissible.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[77:15](etm050.htm#fr_206.md) In the days of the
Mishna, the new moon and new year were fixed, not by astronomical
calculation, as at present, but by actual lunar observation; and it
depended on the early or late appearance of the witnesses whether one or
two days were to be kept. R. Jehudah is of opinion, "that if two days
are celebrated, <span id="page_78">p. 78</span> they form two distinct
holy days, and therefore require two erubin." But the sages did not
coincide with him, as they consider the two days as but one holy day.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[78:16](etm050.htm#fr_207.md) It is not lawful to
select the heave-offering \[consecrated for the use of the priesthood\]
on a holy day. The condition in this instance is: on the first day the
man says, "If this be a working-day, this crateful shall be the
heave-offering for these fruits; but if this be a holy day my selection
is void, and I may eat these fruits as non consecrated." And on the
second day he says, "If yesterday was a working-day, my selection stands
good; but if yesterday was a holy day my selection is void," &c.
