*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER VIII.

§ 1. On the day of atonement, it is forbidden to eat and to drink, to
wash, to anoint, <span id="fr_353"></span>[2](#fn_353.md) to lace on
\[leather\] shoes, and to indulge in sexual intercourse. A king and a
bride \[until the 30th day after her nuptials\] may wash their faces;
and a lying-in woman may lace \[put\] on \[leather\] shoes. Such is the
dictum of Rabbi Eleazar: but the sages prohibit it.

§ 2. Whosoever eats food to the size of a large date, that is, the date
with the kernel, or drinks a mouthful, is guilty. All kinds of

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

food are alike computed by the size of the date, <span
id="fr_354"></span>[3](#fn_354.md) and all liquids by the mouthful; but
food and beverage are not to be joined in the computation. <span
id="fr_355"></span>[3](#fn_354.md)

§ 3. If on one occasion \[through oblivion\], man has eaten and drank,
he needs bring but one sin-offering; if he has eaten and \[also\] done
work, he must bring two \[separate\] sin-offerings; if he has eaten food
which is not edible \[properly and usually adapted for human
sustenance\], or has drunk liquids which are not properly and usually
adapted for beverage—as if, for instance, he leas drunk brine or
fish-lie—he is absolved.

§ 4. Children need not be made to fast, but they are to be \[gradually\]
habituated thereto, a year or two \[before they are by law bound to
fast\], so that they become fluent \[ready and accustomed\] in obeying
the commandments. <span id="fr_356"></span>[4](#fn_355.md)

§ 5. If a pregnant woman, through the smell of food, longs for some on
the Yom Kipur, she is to be fed until she recovers \[is satisfied\]. A
sick person is to be fed by direction of expert \[physicians\]; but if
there be no expert physicians, he is to be fed at his own desire, until
the himself says \[I have\] enough.

§ 6. If a man is seized with bulimy, <span
id="fr_357"></span>[5](#fn_356.md) he is to be fed <span
id="fr_358"></span>[6](#fn_357.md) even with unclean food, until his eyes
become clear \[bright\]. A person who is bitten by a mad dog, on the Yom
Kipur, must not have any of the dogs \[reticule of the liver\] given him
to eat; <span id="fr_359"></span>[7](#fn_358.md) but R. Mathias ben Harash
permits it. Moreover, R. Mathias ben Harash said, "If a person has a
sore throat, it is permitted to put drugs \[medicines\] into his mouth
on the Sabbath, because the disease may endanger his life, and
whatsoever threatens to endanger life supersedes \[the observance of\]
the Sabbath."

§ 7. If a building tumble down, and it is doubtful if any person be
buried beneath the ruins or not; if it is doubtful whether he be dead or
alive, or whether it be a heathen or an Israelite, it is permitted to
remove the ruins from above him on the Sabbath; if he be found alive,
the ruins are to be entirely removed \[so as to extricate him\]; but
should he be dead, he is to be left \[till afterwards\].

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

§ 8. The sin-offering, and trespass-offering for sins done wittingly,
atone \[for sin\]. The Yom Kipur and death, make atonement through
\[sincere\] penitence; penitence makes atonement for slight
transgressions against positive or negative commandments; in grave
transgressions, it obtains a respite <span
id="fr_360"></span>[8](#fn_359.md) until Yom Kipur completes the atonement.

§ 9. He who says, "I will sin, and then repent, I will sin \[again\],
and then do penance," is not permitted \[from on high\] to become
penitent; \[for him who thinks\] "I will sin; the Yom Kipur will atone
for my transgression," Yom Kipur does not make any atonement. A
transgression which a man has been guilty of towards his God, Yom Kipur
will atone for; but a transgression a man has been guilty of towards his
neighbour, Yom Kipur cannot atone for, until he has appeased his
neighbour. For thus R. Eleazar ben Azariah expounds the text, "'From all
your sins before the Lord shall ye be clean:' <span
id="fr_361"></span>[9](#fn_360.md) those transgressions of which man has
been guilty towards his God, Yom Kipur atones for; but for those
transgressions of which man has been guilty towards his neighbour, Yom
Kipur cannot atone, until he has appeased his neighbour." R. Akivah
saith, "Happy are ye, O Israel, before whom do ye cleanse yourselves,
and who cleanses you \[of your transgressions\]? Your father who is in
heaven. For it is said, 'Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and
ye shall be clean;' <span id="fr_362"></span>[10](#fn_361.md) and it is
also said, 'the ‏מקוה‎ <span id="fr_363"></span>[11](#fn_362.md) of Israel
is the Lord;' even as a diving-bath purifies the unclean, so does the
Holy One, blessed be He, cleanse Israel." <span
id="fr_364"></span>[12](#fn_363.md)
