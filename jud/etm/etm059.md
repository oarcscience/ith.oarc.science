*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. On the evening of \[previous to\] the 14th of Nissan, it is
necessary to make search for leaven by the light of a candle; it is not
required to search places in which it is not usual to put leaven. Why
then was it ordered that two rows \[of barrels\] must be searched?
Because it treats there of a warehouse or wine-cellar, in which leaven
is sometimes carried. Beth Shammai decide, "that search must be made
between two rows of barrels over the whole surface of such a warehouse;"
but Beth Hillel say, "It is

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

sufficient to search between the two external rows, which are also the
highest." <span id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_248.md)

§ 2. It needs not be suspected that a weasel might \[possibly\] have
dragged any leaven from one house or place to another; <span
id="fr_249"></span>[2](#fn_249.md) for if so, the same suspicion will
attach to a \[possible\] removal from one court, or even from one city
to another, and \[the search\] would thus become an endless task.

§ 3. R. Jehudah says, "It is necessary to search on the evening before
the 14th \[of Nissan\], or early on the morning of that day, or at the
time \[when all leaven must be removed\];" but the sages say, "If no
search has been made on the evening preceding the 14th, it must be done
on that day: if omitted on that day, it must be done at the time
appointed <span id="fr_250"></span>[3](#fn_250.md) \[for the removal of
leaven\], and in case it was then also omitted, it must be done
afterwards, <span id="fr_251"></span>[4](#fn_251.md) and whatever leaven
remains, must be kept in a well guarded place, that no further search
may become necessary."

§ 4. R. Meir says, "It is lawful to eat \[leaven on the 14th\] the whole
of the first five hours, <span id="fr_252"></span>[5](#fn_252.md) and what
remains must be burned at the commencement of the sixth hour:" but R.
Jehudah says, "It is only permitted to eat \[leaven\] the first four
hours; it must be abstained from during the whole of the fifth hour; and
it must be burned at the commencement of the sixth hour."

§ 5. R. Jehudah also taught, "That formerly, two cakes of
thanksgiving-offering which had become desecrated, were exposed on a
bench or gallery \[of the Temple\]. Whilst they lay there, all the
people did yet eat \[leaven\]: when one was removed, they abstained

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

from eating, but did not burn it; when both were removed, all the people
commenced burning \[the leaven\]." Rabbon Gamaliel says,
"Non-consecrated things may be eaten during the first four hours; but
heave-offering may yet be eaten during the fifth hour: both, however,
must be burned at the commencement of the sixth hour."

§ 6. R. Hanina, the Sagan \[chief or principal\] of the priests, says,
"The priests did never object to burn flesh which had become unclean in
an inferior degree, <span id="fr_253"></span>[6](#fn_253.md) with other
flesh which had become unclean in the first degree, <span
id="fr_254"></span>[7](#fn_254.md) although the \[legal\] impurity of the
first mentioned was thereby increased." R. Akivah added to this, and
said, "The priests did never object to burn the oil of heave-offering,
which had become unclean by being put by an unclean person, who
\[however\] had bathed on that day, into \[a metal\] lamp which had come
in contact with a dead body, although a higher degree of impurity had
thus been added to its former impurity."

§ 7. R. Meir says, "We learn from their words, that it is lawful, on
account of the Passover, to burn clean heave-offering \[of leaven\] with
that which has become unclean;" but R. Jose said to him, "This is not a
\[true\] inference;" R. Eleazar and R. Joshua agree, however, that it is
necessary to burn each separately. Wherein do they differ? Concerning
things whose uncleanliness is doubtful, and things which are certainly
unclean; for R. Eleazar says, "Each of these must be burned separately;"
but R. Joshua says, "They may be burned together."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_248"></span>[98:1](etm059.htm#fr_248.md) This is variously
explained; the plainest exposition seems to be the following:—supposing
100 barrels to be piled up one on the other, in a cellar or warehouse,
in ten rows of ten barrels each; according to Beth Shammai, the front
and top rows must be searched; but Beth Hillel consider it sufficient to
search between the two external rows (i.e. those in a perpendicular
position), in the first only.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[98:2](etm059.htm#fr_249.md) From a place that has
not been searched to one that has.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[98:3](etm059.htm#fr_250.md) The word ‏מועד‎ is
here rendered according to Rashi; others have explained it in its usual
sense, namely, "festival."

<span id="fn_251"></span>[98:4](etm059.htm#fr_251.md) After the search has
been made to serve for the consumption of the family, between that time
and the period when all leaven must be burned, or otherwise removed.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[98:5](etm059.htm#fr_252.md) That is, Till eleven
o'clock. To reduce the rabbinical hours to our modern computation of
time, add six to the hours mentioned in the Mishna.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[99:6](etm059.htm#fr_253.md) That is, the second
degree of impurity.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[99:7](etm059.htm#fr_254.md) This, and the
following section, can only be properly understood by a knowledge of the
laws laid down on this subject in Seder Taharot.
