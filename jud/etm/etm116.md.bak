### CHAPTER XIV.

§ 1. When a deaf and dumb man marries a sound <span
id="fr_756"></span>[1](#fn_751.md) woman, or a sound man marries a deaf and
dumb woman, he may either divorce his wife or keep her, and even as he
married her by certain signs \[made before witnesses\] thus may he
divorce her in the same manner. A sound man who had married a sound
woman, who afterwards became deaf and dumb, may either divorce or keep
her as he pleases, but if she became afflicted with madness, he is not
at liberty to divorce her. Should he become deaf and dumb, or mad, he
may not divorce her at all. R. Jochanan ben Noori asked, "Why may a
woman who became deaf and dumb be divorced, and a husband who thus
became affected may not divorce his wife?" They \[the sages\] replied
unto him, "Because there is a material difference in this respect
between the two parties, for a woman may be divorced with or without her
consent, but the man's consent is necessary to render a divorce valid."

§ 2. R. Jochanan ben Gudgodah testified \[to have been taught\], "That a
deaf and dumb female, who, in her minority, had been disposed of in
marriage by her father, may be divorced by the delivery of a *Get* to
her." They \[the sages\] said unto him, "This also is applicable to the
case where the loss of hearing and speech occurs after marriage."

§ 3. When two brothers who are deaf and dumb are married to two women in
the same state, who are sisters to each other, or to two sisters who are
sound, or that one is sound and the other deaf and dumb, or two deaf and
dumb sisters married to two brothers who are sound, or to two brothers
who are thus afflicted, or that one of

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

the brothers is deaf and dumb, and the other sound, then in all the
mentioned cases the sisters are released from the obligation of *Yeboom*
and of *Chalitzah*. When the deaf and dumb females are not related to
each other, the surviving brother must marry the widow by
*Yeboom*, <span id="fr_757"></span>[2](#fn_752.md) but may divorce them
afterwards. <span id="fr_758"></span>[3](#fn_753.md)

§ 4. If two brothers, one of whom is deaf and dumb, and the other not
so, should marry two sound women, and the deaf and dumb husband dies,
what must the \[surviving\] sound brother who had married the sound
sister do? \[Nothing\] because his brother's widow is free from
*Yeboom*, as sister of his wife. If the sound man married to the sound
woman die, what must the surviving deaf and dumb brother married to the
sound sister do? He must separate from his wife by a *Get*, and his
brother's widow will be for ever prohibited to re-marry. <span
id="fr_759"></span>[4](#fn_754.md)

§ 5. When two sound brothers are married to two sisters, one of whom is
deaf and dumb, and the other sound; when the sound man married to the
deaf and dumb woman dies first, what must the \[surviving\] sound man
married to the sound sister do? \[Nothing\] because the widow is
released as being his wife's sister. When the sound man married to the
sound sister dies first, what must the \[surviving\] sound brother
married to the deaf and dumb sister do? He must separate from his wife
by a *Get*, and from his sister-in-law by *Chalitzah*.

§ 6. When two brothers, one of whom is deaf and dumb, and the other
sound, are married to two sisters, one of whom is deaf and dumb, and the
other sound, if the deaf and dumb husband of the deaf and dumb woman die
first, what must the sound husband of the sound woman do? \[Nothing\]
because the widow is released as his wife's sister. If the sound husband
of the sound woman die first, what must the deaf and dumb husband of the
deaf and dumb woman do? He must separate from his wife by a *Get*, and
his brother's widow is for ever prohibited to re-marry.

§ 7. When two brothers, one of whom is deaf and dumb, and the other
sound, are married to two sound women not related to each

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

other, and the deaf and dumb husband of the sound woman dies first, what
must the \[surviving\] husband of the sound woman do? He must either
receive *Chalitzah* of his brother's relict, or must marry her by
*Yeboom*. If the sound brother, husband of the sound woman, happen to
die first, what must the \[surviving\] deaf and dumb brother, husband of
the sound woman do? He must marry her, but has not the power ever to
divorce her.

§ 8. When two sound brothers are married to two women not related to
each other, one of whom is sound, and the other deaf and dumb, when the
sound husband of the deaf and dumb woman dies first, what must the sound
husband of the sound woman do? He must either marry his brother's
relict, or divorce her as he pleases. When the sound husband of the
sound woman dies first, what must the sound husband of the deaf and dumb
woman do? He must either receive *Chalitzah* from his brother's relict,
or must marry her by *Yeboom*.

§ 9. When two brothers, one of whom is deaf and dumb, and the other
sound, are married to two women not related to each other, one of whom
is deaf and dumb, and the other sound, should the deaf and dumb husband
of the deaf and dumb woman die first, what must the sound husband of the
sound woman do? He must marry his brother's relict by *Yeboom*, but may
divorce her afterwards. When the sound husband of the sound woman dies
first, the deaf and dumb husband of the deaf and dumb woman must marry
her without being at liberty to divorce her.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[231:1](etm116.htm#fr_756.md) Observe, that
wherever in this chapter the word "sound" is mentioned, as applied to
either man or woman, it signifies a person who is in possession of the
faculties of hearing and speech.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[232:2](etm116.htm#fr_757.md) He cannot receive
*Chalitzah* from her, as that ceremony can only be performed by persons
who are in possession of their faculties of hearing and speech.

<span id="fn_753"></span>[232:3](etm116.htm#fr_758.md) By giving her *Get*,
which he may do by signs or gestures, indicative of his assent.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[232:4](etm116.htm#fr_759.md) For the
brother-in-law can as a deaf and dumb person not receive *Chalitzah*
