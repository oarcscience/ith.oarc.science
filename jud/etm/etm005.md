------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER IV.

§ 1. The morning prayer \[may be said\] until noon. R. Jehudah saith,
"until the fourth hour." The ‏מנחה‎ prayer until the evening. R. Jehudah
saith, "until \[the expiration\] of half the time \[appointed for\] the
‏מנחה‎ sacrifice. The evening prayer \[is not limited\] to any fixed
time, and the ‏מוסף‎ \[additional prayer\] \[may be said\] all day. R.
Jehudah saith, "until the seventh hour \[only\]."

§ 2. R. Nehooniah ben Hakanah used to pronounce a short prayer when he
entered the Beth Hamedrash \[College\], and again

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

when he left it. They \[the sages\] asked him, "What occasion
\[authority\] is there for this prayer?" He answered them, "When I
enter, I pray that no cause of offence may arise through me; and when I
quit, I return thanks for my vocation \[as a teacher of the law\]."

§ 3. Rabbon Gamaliel saith, "Man must daily say the eighteen
benedictions." R. Joshua saith, "a compendium of the eighteen
\[benedictions\]." R. Akivah saith, "If the ‏תפלה‎ is fluent in a man's
mouth, he says the eighteen \[benedictions\]; if not, he only says a
compendium of the eighteen \[benedictions\]."

§ 4. R. Eleazar saith, "If a man turns his prayers into a fixed charge
\[or burthen\] they cease to be humble supplications." R. Joshua saith,
"If a man travels in dangerous places, let him say this short prayer,
'Save, O Lord, thy people, the remnant of Israel; at every stage of
their journeying, <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) let their wants be
present before thee. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hearest prayers.'"

§ 5. If a man rides on an ass, he must dismount: if he cannot dismount,
he turns his face towards the Sanctum Sanctorum; and if he cannot turn
his face, he is to direct his mind to that most holy place.

§ 6. If he is seated in a ship, or in a cart, or in a waggon \[on a
raft\], he directs his mind to the Sanctum Sanctorum.

§ 7. R. Eleazar saith, the ‏מוסף‎ \[additional prayer\], is only to be
read in a public congregation. But the sages say, "Whether there be \[a
congregation\] or not, \[this prayer must be read\]." R. Jehudah said,
in the name \[on the authority\] of R. Eleazar, "In all places where
there is a public congregation, single individuals are exempt from
praying ‏מוסף‎."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_16"></span>[6:1](etm005.htm#fr_16.md) The expression in the
original, ‏בכל פרשת העבור‎, is very obscure, and has been variously
rendered. According to some, it means "at every cross-road." According
to others, "even when they \[Israel\] turn away and transgress." The
translation we have adopted seems most in accordance with the context.
