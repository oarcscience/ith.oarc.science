# XVII. TREATISE SUCCAH,

###### OR, OF TABERNACLES.

### <span class="smallcaps">Introduction</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> book contains rules and regulations
for the due observance of the festival of tabernacles. The law
instituting this festival is to be found in the Pentateuch, Levit.
xxiii. 33–43. "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the
children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month
shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the Lord. On the
first day shall be a holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile
work therein. … Also, in the fifteenth day of the 7th month, when ye
have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the
Lord, seven days: on the first day shall be a Sabbath, and on the eighth
day shall be a Sabbath, And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit
of the tree Hadar, branches of palm-trees, and the boughs of
myrtle-trees, and willows of the brook, and ye shall rejoice before the
Lord your God seven days: and ye shall keep it a feast unto the Lord
seven days in the year. It shall be a statute for ever in your
generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month. Ye shall dwell
in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in
booths: that your generations may know that I made the children of
Israel to dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt:
I am the Lord."

The precise manner in which these various enactments and observances are
to be carried out, is the subject of the present Treatise; it also
treats of certain ceremonies and public rejoicings that were celebrated
at Jerusalem, and which have given rise to the Simchath Torah of later
ages.
