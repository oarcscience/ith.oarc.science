*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER IV.

§ 1. In places where it is customary to work till noon on the day before
Passover. work may be done; but not in places where it is not customary
to work thereon. If a person should go from a place where the said
custom prevails, to another place where it does not, or the reverse, he
will be subject to the rigour of the custom, either of the place he came
from, or of that he went to. <span id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_280.md) And
it is always proper not to act differently from the established customs
of a place, on account of the disputes to which such conduct may lead.

§ 2. Even so, when a person brings fruits of the sabbatical year, from a
place where the same are no longer growing in the fields, to another
place where they are yet growing, or the reverse, he is bound to remove
them: R. Jehudah says, they might say to such a person, "Go thou also,
and fetch for thyself similar fruit from the field." <span
id="fr_281"></span>[2](#fn_281.md)

§ 3. In places where it is usual to sell small cattle \[sheep, goats,
&c.\] to non-Israelites, it is lawful to do so, but not in places where
it is not customary. Large cattle may not be sold to them at

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

all, <span id="fr_282"></span>[3](#fn_282.md) neither calves nor foals of
asses, either sound or broken \[legged\]; R. Jehudah permits the sale of
the latter, and Ben Beterah that of the horse.

§ 4. In places where it is usual to eat roasted meat on the night of the
Passover, it may be eaten, but not in places where this custom does not
exist. In places where it is usual to burn a light on the night of the
day of atonement, it may be done; but not in places where this custom
does not exist. The synagogues and schools \[for the study of the law\]
may, however, be lighted; as also dark alleys, and near sick people.

§ 5. In places where it is usual to work on the 9th of Ab, work may be
done; but not where it is not customary. The learned \[in the Holy Law\]
however, must every where abstain from work thereon; Rabbon Simeon, son
of Gamaliel, says, "Every one ought, in this respect, to consider
himself as a learned man;" the sages say, "It was customary, in the land
of Judah, to work till noon on the day preceding the Passover; but in
Palestine they did not work at all \[on that day\];" and with respect to
the evening which precedes it, Beth Shammai prohibit to work
thereon, <span id="fr_283"></span>[4](#fn_283.md) but Beth Hillel allow it
till \[the morrow's\] sunrise.

§ 6. R. Meir says, "Every occupation which had been commenced prior to
the 14th, may he finished on that day; but no new work may be commenced,
although it can be finished thereon. The sages are of opinion that the
three following handicrafts may exercise their calling on the day before
the Passover, namely, tailors, barbers, and laundresses; Rabbi José, son
of Jehudah, says, also the strap-makers. <span
id="fr_284"></span>[5](#fn_284.md)

§ 7. Fowls may, on the 14th, be placed in hatching-coops; a brooding-hen
which had run away \[from her eggs\], may be replaced on them \[during
the middle-days\], and if the hen have died another may be put on the
eggs to replace her. It is lawful to remove on the 14th, the stable-dung
from between the feet of cattle; but it may only be removed to one side
\[not entirely removed\], during the middle-days. It is also permitted
to carry on the 14th, to and from

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

the houses of handicraftsmen, vessels and other articles, although they
are not wanted for use during the festival.

§ 8. The inhabitants of Jericho used to do six things; three of which
were prohibited to them, and three were not. The following are those
riot prohibited: they used to graft palm-trees the whole day of the
14th, they used to read the "Shemang" with hasty involution, <span
id="fr_285"></span>[6](#fn_285.md) and they used to cut down and make heaps
of the new corn before the "omer" was offered,—these were not prohibited
to them; but the following were: namely, they used to allow themselves
the use of plants growing on or near consecrated trees, <span
id="fr_286"></span>[7](#fn_286.md) and also to eat on the Sabbath fruit
which had dropt off the trees, <span id="fr_287"></span>[8](#fn_287.md) and
they suffered herbs to stand in the field as peah; <span
id="fr_288"></span>[9](#fn_288.md) all which the sages prohibited to them.

§ 9. The following six things were done by King Hezekiah; three of which
were approved of, and three were disapproved:—he caused the bones of his
father <span id="fr_289"></span>[10](#fn_289.md) to be transported on a
litter or hurdle of cords \[or ropes\], <span
id="fr_290"></span>[11](#fn_290.md) and this was approved of; he caused the
brazen-serpent to be broken to pieces, <span
id="fr_291"></span>[12](#fn_291.md) and this also was approved of; he
secreted the book of [medicine](errata.htm#0.md), <span
id="fr_292"></span>[13](#fn_292.md) and it was approved. The following

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

are the three things of which they disapproved:—he cut off \[the gold\]
from the gates of the Temple, and sent it to the king of Assyria; <span
id="fr_293"></span>[14](#fn_293.md) he stopped up the water-course of
Gihon; <span id="fr_294"></span>[15](#fn_294.md) and made the month of
Nissan intercalary: <span id="fr_295"></span>[16](#fn_295.md) all of which
were disapproved of.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_280"></span>[104:1](etm062.htm#fr_280.md) That is, he may not
work at all. This prohibition, however, is limited to one whose
intention is to return to his place; but if he came to settle
permanently, he is considered, in this respect, the same as the persons
of the place he intends to live in, and may work or not on the 14th,
according as it may happen to be customary in that place.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[104:2](etm062.htm#fr_281.md) This Mishna cannot
be understood without reference to chap. IX. § 5, of Treatise
Shevingith.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[105:3](etm062.htm#fr_282.md) The reason is, lest
the heathens may put the animals to work on the Sabbath. This
restriction has been subsequently abolished, as appears from Shulchan
Aruch, vol. II. chap. 151, § 4.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[105:4](etm062.htm#fr_283.md) This refers alone to
the Galileans, and others who were accustomed not to work at all on the
14th of Nissan.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[105:5](etm062.htm#fr_284.md) Namely, those who
make leathern straps for sandals, and mend them.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[106:6](etm062.htm#fr_285.md) The solutions given
in the Talmud and by commentators of this strange expression of the
original ‏וכורכין את שמע‎ are various: according to some, the fault of
the inhabitants of Jericho, consisted in not dwelling sufficiently on
the last syllable of the word ‏אחד‎, before commencing the reading of
‏ואהבת‎ and the following verses. According to others, they made this
necessary pause, but did not say the verse ‏ברוך שם כבוד מלכותו לעולם
ועד‎, before commencing ‏ואהבת‎,to, thus wrapping or involving the
verses together, which are prescribed to be read with a pause between
the first verse of the Shemang and the subsequent ones.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[106:7](etm062.htm#fr_286.md) The original
expression ‏גמזיות‎, has also given cause to much interpretation: some
understand by it the parasitical plants growing on a tree, and which
derive their nourishment and growth from the tree itself (*e.g.* the
mistletoe on the apple-trees or oaks). Others read here ‏גוזיות‎, and
explain it, that they pruned the consecrated trees, and used the wood.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[106:8](etm062.htm#fr_287.md) Fruit which has
dropt off a tree on the Sabbath may not be used thereon.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[106:9](etm062.htm#fr_288.md) In order that the
poor may not be led into the error of eating it untithed ‏טבל‎, thinking
it to be peah. (See Treatise ‏שביעית‎.)

<span id="fn_289"></span>[106:10](etm062.htm#fr_289.md) The wicked Ahaz.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[106:11](etm062.htm#fr_290.md) As a mark of
dishonour and expiation; also to shew the people his abhorrence of his
father's wicked career. (See 2 Chron. xxviii. 27.)

<span id="fn_291"></span>[106:12](etm062.htm#fr_291.md) As mentioned 2
Kings xviii. 4: "And broke to pieces the brazen-serpent that Moses had
made, because the children of Israel burned incense to it."

<span id="fn_292"></span>[106:13](etm062.htm#fr_292.md) Because, according
to some commentators, the Israelites trusted to it in case of illness,
and did not pray for help to God. Maimonides rejects this
interpretation, and says, "How could they thus attribute to Hezekiah a
motive <span id="page_107">p. 107</span> that even the lowest capacity
would be ashamed of, and impute folly to the sages of his time who
approved of it. The same might be said to a hungry man about to take
food to allay his craving; were any to say, 'He ought to trust to God,
who can aid him without this:' we would say to such, 'Fools that ye are!
Even as we thank God when we eat, that he caused us to find what will
allay our natural want, and eat it thankfully: thus also we ought to
thank him that he gave us wisdom to find out a cure for our bodily
ailments, and use it accordingly.' It is, indeed, a waste of time to
argue against so obvious an absurdity, if it were not that the above
opinion had been publicly taught. The reason, however, why King Hezekiah
secreted this book of medicine was, because it was therein pretended to
cure diseases by means of astrological spells, talismans, and other vain
and superstitious means, which might lead the people to ignorance and
idolatry."

<span id="fn_293"></span>[107:14](etm062.htm#fr_293.md) See 2 Kings xviii.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[107:15](etm062.htm#fr_294.md) 15 See 2 Chron.
xxxii. 30.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[107:16](etm062.htm#fr_295.md) 2 Chron. xxx. 2.
