### CHAPTER IV.

§ 1. The loolab and willow \[to surround the altar, was sometimes used\]
on six \[days\], and \[sometimes\] on seven \[days of the festival\].
The hallel and the joyous repasts, \[eating of peace-offerings, took
place on\] eight \[days\]. The \[dwelling in the\] succah, and the
pouring out water, \[lasted\] seven \[days\], and the pipes \[were
played on sometimes\] five, and \[sometimes\] six \[days\].

§ 2. \[In which case was\] the loolab \[used\] seven \[days?\] how? When
the first holy day of the festival fell on a Sabbath, the loolab \[was
used on\] seven \[days\]; but, \[when the first day of the festival fell
on\] any other day \[of the week\] the loolab \[is only used\] six
\[days\]. <span id="fr_394"></span>[1](#fn_393.md)

§ 3. \[In which case was\] the willow \[used on\] seven \[days?\] How?
When the seventh day of the willow happened to fall on a Sabbath, \[the
willow was used\] seven \[days\]; but, when the seventh day fell on any
other day \[of the week\], the willow was only used six \[days\].

§ 4. How was the command to take the loolab \[fulfilled\] when the first
holy day of the festival fell on a Sabbath? \[It was the custom that\]
every man brought his loolab to the Temple mount, where it was received
by inspectors, who deposited it in a gallery. The elders placed theirs
in a \[separate\] chamber; and the people were taught to say, "Whosoever
gets hold of my loolab; be it his \[I bestow it on him\] as a gift." On
the \[next\] morning the people came early; the inspectors threw all the
loolabs down before them; every man seized on one, and it often happened
that they hurt each other \[in the scramble\]. When the Beth Din <span
id="fr_395"></span>[2](#fn_394.md) saw that people were thus exposed to
danger, they decreed that every man was to use his loolab in his own
house.

§ 5. How was the command to take the willow \[fulfilled\]? There was a
place below Jerusalem called to ‏מוצא‎: <span
id="fr_396"></span>[3](#fn_395.md) thither the people descended, and
gathered drooping willow branches: these they brought and placed at the
side of the altar, the tips inclining over it. While this was doing, a
blast, a long note, and again a blast were blown.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Every day they
made one circuit round the altar, and recited \[the verse\], "‏אנא ה׳
הצליהח נא‎, ‏אנא ה׳ הושיעה נא‎." R. Jehudah said the words, ‏אני והו
הושיצה נא‎ \[were also said\]. On the particular day for using the
willows \[the seventh of the festival\] they made seven circuits round
the altar. When they withdrew, what did they say? "Beauty is thine, O
altar! Beauty is thine, O altar!" R. Eleazar said, \[they also said\]
"To God and to thee, O altar! To God and to thee, O altar!" <span
id="fr_397"></span>[4](#fn_396.md)

§ 6. As they did on the week-days, so they did likewise on the Sabbath;
excepting only that they gathered the willow branches on the
Sabbath-eve, and put them into golden casks \[filled with water\], that
they might not fade. R. Joshua ben Beroka saith, "They fetched branches
of palms, and threshed \[beat\] them to pieces at the sides of the
altar." \[According to another version, "on the altar."\] Thence the day
was called "the branch threshing-day."

§ 7. Directly afterwards the children threw down their loolabs, and eat
their citrons.

§ 8. How \[was it that\] the hallel and joyous repasts \[took place on\]
eight \[days\]? Because it is deduced that man is bound to recite the
hallel, and to enjoy the repasts \[of his peace-offerings\] in honour of
the last day of the festival, even as on the preceding days thereof. How
\[is it that\] the succah \[is dwelt in\] seven \[days\]? When a man has
taken his last meal therein, he is not directly to pull down his succah;
but, after noon, he moves the furniture back \[into the house\], in
honour of the last day of the festival.

§ 9. How was the pouring out of the water? A golden pitcher, that held
three lugs was filled with water from the \[brook\] Siloah. When they
came \[with it\] to the water-gate, they blew a blast, a long note, and
again a blast. The priest then ascended the stair \[of the altar\], and
turned to the left; two silver basins stood there. R. Jehudah saith,
"they were of gypsum \[stucco\], but had a dark appearance from the
wine." Each was perforated with a small hole, like a nostril \[at the
bottom\]. The one \[for the wine\] somewhat wider, the other \[for the
water\] narrower, that both might get empty at once. The one, to the
west, \[was used\] for the water; the other, to the east, for the wine:
but if the water was poured into the wine basin, or the wine into the
water basin, it was legal. R. Jehudah

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

saith, "They poured out one lug on each of the eight days. To him who
poured out the water the people called, 'Raise thy hand;' for once it
happened that one \[priest charged with this duty\] poured the water
over his feet, <span id="fr_398"></span>[5](#fn_397.md) and all the people
pelted him to death with their citrons."

§ 10. As they did on the week-days so they did likewise on the Sabbath,
except that they fetched the water from Siloah on the Sabbath-eve, in a
golden cask that had not been consecrated, and placed it in a chamber;
if it was upset, or uncovered, they filled again from the laver. For it
was not lawful to bring on the altar, water or wine which had been
uncovered.
