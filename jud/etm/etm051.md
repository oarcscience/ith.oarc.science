### CHAPTER IV.

§ 1. If foes, or an evil spirit \[a fit of insanity\], have caused a man
to go out \[beyond the Sabbath-limit\], he must not \[when recovering
his own free agency\] move further than four amoth; if they \[the foes
or the fit\] have carried him back, it is as if he had not gone out
\[beyond the limit\]. If they have carried him into another town, or put
him into a pen \[prison\] or fold \[for cattle\], he may, according to
Rabbon Gamaliel, and R. Eleazar ben Azariah, "go about throughout its
whole \[extent\];" but R. Joshua and R. Akivah maintain, "that he must
not move further than four amoth." It once happened

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

that they \[these four sages\] came together from Parendisim, <span
id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_208.md) and their vessel kept the sea \[on the
Sabbath\]: Rabbon Gamaliel and R. Eleazar ben Azariah walked about
throughout the whole \[extent of the vessel\]; but R. Joshua and R.
Akivah did not move beyond four amoth, as they wished \[to take\] the
rigid \[observance\] upon themselves.

§ 2. Once \[on the Sabbath-eve\] they \[the sages, being on board a
vessel\] did not enter the haven \[landing-place\] till after dark; they
inquired of Rabbon Gamaliel, "What are we \[to do as\] to descending
\[from the vessel\]?" He answered them, "It is permitted; for I observed
that we had already entered \[within\] the limits \[of the Sabbath
distance\] before dusk."

§ 3. He who is authorised to go out \[beyond the legal distance\] on
business of importance to public or private welfare \[or safety\], and
is told "the thing is already done," has \[the liberty to go\] 2000
amoth in any direction. If he still was within the Techoom \[the lawful
Sabbath distance\], it is as if he had not gone forth at all; for all
those who go forth to save are . \[permitted to\] return to their abodes
\[on the day of rest\].

§ 4. If a man sits down by the road-side \[towards dusk on the
Sabbath-eve\], and then gets up and sees that he is near a town, as it
had not been his intention to enter the town, he must not enter. <span
id="fr_209"></span>[2](#fn_209.md) Such is the dictum of R. Meir; but R.
Jehudah saith he may enter. <span id="fr_210"></span>[3](#fn_210.md) R.
Jehudah said, "It once happened that R. Tarphon entered \[a town\],
although \[it had\] not \[been\] his intention \[so to do\]."

§ 5. He who falls asleep on the road \[the eve of the day of rest\], and
knows not that it is become dark \[night has set in\] has \[when he
awakes\], the right of going 2000 amoth in any direction. Such is the
dictum of R. Eleazar ben Nourie; but the sages hold, that he has \[only
the right to move\] four amoth. R. Eleazar saith, "and he is in
\[forms\] the centre <span id="fr_211"></span>[4](#fn_211.md) \[of these
four amoth\]." R. Jehudah saith, "He can go \[four\] amoth in whichever
direction he pleases;" but R. Jehudah admitted, "that if he \[such a
person\] has

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

made his choice, he cannot \[afterwards\] go back therefrom \[recall or
alter it\]."

§ 6: If there be two \[persons so situated\], and part of the four amoth
\[permitted\] to each are within the limits of the other, <span
id="fr_212"></span>[5](#fn_212.md) they may meet and take their meal
together, in the middle \[of their joint space\]; provided always, that
neither of them exceed his own limits by going into those of his
neighbour. If there are three persons \[so situated\], and \[part of the
four amoth belonging to\] the middle one is swallowed by \[forms part of
the limits belonging to\] the others, \[each of the two outside
ones\], <span id="fr_213"></span>[6](#fn_213.md) he is at liberty to meet
each of them, and each of them may meet him; but the two outside ones
are not permitted to meet each other. R. Simeon saith, "What is this
like? Three courts opening into each other, and also open towards the
public reshuth; if the two outer ones have joined in crab with the
middle one, they are at liberty \[to carry and convey from the middle
court\] to each of the outer ones, and from them into it; but the two
outer ones must not \[carry and convey\] from one to the other."

§ 7. If a man be on the road, and is overtaken by the dusk \[on the eve
of the day of rest\], should he distinguish \[single out\] a tree or
hedge, and say, "Under it \[I will take\] my Sabbath rest," it is \[in
law\] as if he had said nothing; <span id="fr_214"></span>[7](#fn_214.md)
\[but should he say\], "At its basis \[I will take\] my Sabbath rest,"
he may go from the spot on which he stands to the base \[of the tree or
hedge\], 2000 amoth, and from the base unto his domicile 2000 amoth
\[more\]; thus it is found that, after dark, he may go 4000 amoth.

§ 8. If he cannot distinguish \[single out a tree or a hedge\], or
should he not be conversant with the halachah \[decisions of the oral
law\], if he says, "\[I will take\] my Sabbath-rest on the spot \[where
I stand\]," the spot \[which he occupies\] obtains for him 2000 amoth in
any direction; in a circle, according to the dictum of R. Haninah ben
Antigonus: but the sages hold \[that he has 2000 amoth\] square, so that
he gains the angles.

§ 9. This \[rule above laid down\] is the explication of their \[the
sages’\] saying, "The poor prepares his erub with his foot." R. Meir
saith, "This rule \[then\] we apply only to the poor;" but R. Jehudah
replied, "To the poor and to the rich \[alike\], inasmuch as the erub
with bread was only decreed, to make the observance more easy for

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

the wealthy, so that he should not be forced to go out on his own feet
to prepare the erub.

§ 10. If a man \[on the eve of the day of rest\] has been dispatched by
his townsmen, to combine by erub a town \[or village in the vicinity\],
and has been induced to go back by a neighbour \[before he has completed
his errand\], he is permitted to go \[to the place in question\]; but
all his townsmen are forbidden \[to go thither\]. Such is the dictum of
R. Jehudah; but R. Meir saith, "Whosoever can prepare the erub, but does
not prepare it, is \[like at once driving\] an ass \[and leading\] a
camel."

§ 11. Whoever is gone beyond the techoom, even \[the distance of\] a
single amah, must not go back \[the whole techoom\]. R. Eleazar saith,
"\[If he has gone\] two amoth \[beyond the techoom\] he may go back, but
if three amoth, he must not go back." <span
id="fr_215"></span>[8](#fn_215.md) R. Simeon saith, "Even \[should he go\]
fifteen amoth \[beyond the techoom\] he may go back, as the
land-surveyors \[who fix the limits\] are not very exact in their
measurement, as they take into consideration those who might err." <span
id="fr_216"></span>[9](#fn_216.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_208"></span>[79:1](etm051.htm#fr_208.md) This is supposed to
be Brundusium, the usual place of embarkation for those who proceeded
from Rome to Greece and the East.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[79:2](etm051.htm#fr_209.md) That is, he must not
proceed further than the legal distance of 2000 amoth into the town; so
that he has not the same privilege as others who may traverse its whole
extent.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[79:3](etm051.htm#fr_210.md) And is entitled to
partake of the privilege.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[79:4](etm051.htm#fr_211.md) So that he has only
two amoth to move in.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[80:5](etm051.htm#fr_212.md) Supposing they are
six amoth asunder.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[80:6](etm051.htm#fr_213.md) Supposing the two
outside ones are ten amoth asunder.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[80:7](etm051.htm#fr_214.md) So that he must not
move further than four amoth.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[81:8](etm051.htm#fr_215.md) R. Eleazar is of
opinion, that the man has four amoth beyond the techoom, of which four
amoth he forms the centre, so that he may move two amoth.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[81:9](etm051.htm#fr_216.md) According to Rashi,
those who measured the ground did not measure from the end of the line,
but from the end of their hand; so that the portion of the line they
held in their hand was not included in the measurement, which was thus
lessened by fifteen amoth. Others aver, that the legal distance was
purposely shortened by fifteen amoth.
