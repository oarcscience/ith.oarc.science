*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER XII.

§ 1. He who builds, how much must he build to become guilty? Whoever
builds at all \[be it ever so little\], whoever chops a stone, strikes
with a hammer, or uses a plane, or bores a hole; \[whosoever\] at all
\[does either of these\] is guilty. The rule is, whosoever does any
work, which is lasting and durable, <span
id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_138.md) on the Sabbath, is guilty. R. Simeon ben
Gamaliel saith, "He \[likewise is guilty\] who strikes with a hammer on
an anvil, because it appears as if he prepared \[or finished off\] work.

§ 2. Whoever ploughs at all, or weeds, or clears \[away parasite
branches; whoever\] at all \[does either of these\], is guilty. Whoever
gathers wood, if to \[clear\], improve \[the\] ground, any quantity,
\[however small\]; if to burn, sufficient to boil a light egg. Whoever
gathers herbs, if to \[clear\], improve the ground, any quantity,
\[however small\]; if for \[feeding\] a beast, sufficient for a kid's
mouthful.

§ 3. Whoever writes two letters, whether with his right or with

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

his left hand, whether the one letter \[twice\], or two \[different\]
letters, or with different inks, in any language \[or character\], is
guilty. R. José saith, "The writing of two letters was prohibited,
solely because \[they may serve\] to mark \[withal\]; for the boards of
the tabernacle were thus lettered, to know how to match them." Rabbi
saith, "We find short names, \[which are abbreviations\] of larger ones;
as ‏שם‎ \[Sam or Sim\], from Samuel or Simeon; ‏נח‎ \[Noah\], from
Nahor; ‏גן‎ \[Dan\], from Daniel; ‏גד‎ \[Gad\], from Gadiel.

§ 4. Whoever, on one occasion, unwittingly \[off-hand at once\] writes
two letters, is guilty; whether he write with ink, or paint, or ruddle,
or gum, or vitriol, or any \[other\] substance that leaves a \[lasting\]
mark. \[Moreover, whoever writes\] on the two \[angles forming\] corner
walls, or on two tablets \[leaves\] of an account-book, <span
id="fr_139"></span>[3](#fn_139.md) so that the two correspond, <span
id="fr_140"></span>[4](#fn_140.md) is guilty. Whoever writes on his \[own\]
flesh, is guilty. Whoever scratches \[alphabetical characters\] on his
own flesh, R Eleazar \[pronounces\] bound to bring a sin-offering; but
R. Joshua absolves him.

§ 5. Whoever writes with \[any kind of dark\] beverage \[liquid\], or
with the juice of fruit, or with dust from the road, or with writing
sand, or with any \[other\] substance which is not durable, is absolved;
\[whoever writes\] with the back of his hand, or his foot, or his mouth,
or his elbow, or if he writes \[adds\] one letter to writing \[which is
already written\], or writes over writing; \[moreover\], if he intended
to write \[the letter\] ‏ח‎, but actually wrote two ‏ז‎, \[or wrote\]
one \[letter\] on the ground, and one on the boards \[partition\], or
wrote on two walls of the house, or on two leaves of an account-book,
which do not correspond \[cannot be joined\], so that the writing may be
read \[as a whole\]; \[whoever does either of these\] is absolved.
Whoever writes one letter of notaricon <span
id="fr_141"></span>[5](#fn_141.md) is, by R. Joshua ben Bethera, pronounced
guilty; but the sages absolve him.

§ 6. Whoever unwittingly writes two letters on two \[different\]
occasions, \[as\], one in the morning, and one towards evening, is, by
Rabbon Gamaliel, pronounced guilty; but the sages absolve him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_138"></span>[54:1](etm034.htm#fr_138.md) Such work as is done
on the Sabbath remains, either *per se*, or as an integral portion of
something else, *in statu quo*, after the Sabbath.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[55:3](etm034.htm#fr_139.md) ‏פנקס‎, derived from
the Greek πινακος, *pinacos*, and used by the Mishna to designate books
of account, such as are used by commercial men.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[55:4](etm034.htm#fr_140.md) I.e. So that the two
can be joined, and the letters matched, to be read as forming one whole.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[55:5](etm034.htm#fr_141.md) A kind of short-hand
used by law-writers \[notaries, from whom it derived its name\], and
formed by the initial letters of the different words composing a
sentence.
