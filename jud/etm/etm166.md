### CHAPTER II.

§ 1. If he \[a person\] has poured \[water\] on one hand at one gush,
his hand is clean; \[if\] on both hands at one gush, R. Meir declares
them \[still to continue\] unclean, until he has poured \[water\] out of
a quarter-lug \[vessel\] upon them. Should a loaf of heave <span
id="fr_1302"></span>[1](#fn_1297.md) fall \[on the water\], it \[remains\]
clean. R. José \[however\] declares it unclean.

§ 2. Has he poured out his first \[ablution\] in one place, and his
second in another place, should a loaf of heave fall on the first, it
\[becomes\] unclean, if on the second, it \[remains\] clean. Has he
poured out his first and second \[ablutions\] into one place, and a loaf
of heave fall thereon, it \[becomes\] unclean. Should he pour out his
first \[ablution\], and find on his hand a splinter or small stone, his
hands continue unclean, as the second water only purifies the first
\[water\] on the hand. <span id="fr_1303"></span>[2](#fn_1298.md) R. Simeon
ben Gamaliel saith, "Whatsoever is a production of the water, \[and is
found on the hand after the first ablution, does not prevent the hand
from being\] clean."

§ 3. The hands become unclean or clean up to the wrist. How \[is this
meant\]? Should he pour the first \[ablution\] up to the wrist, and the
second \[ablution\] above the wrist, and some of the water runs back
into the hand, that \[continues\] clean. Should he have poured \[both\]
the first and the second \[ablutions\] above the wrist, and some of the
water runs back into the hand, that \[becomes\] unclean. Should he have
poured the first \[ablution\] over one hand, and then the second
\[ablution\] over both hands together, they are unclean. Should he have
poured the first \[ablution\] over both hands, and then the second
\[ablution\] over one hand only, his hand is clean. Should he have
poured \[water\] on one hand, and then rubbed it against its fellow
\[his other hand\], it \[the hand on which he poured the water\] becomes
unclean; \[but if he rubbed it\] against

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

his head, or against the wall, it remains clean. They may \[at once\]
pour \[water\] over \[the hands of\] four or five \[persons\] alongside
of each other or above each other, provided always, they be careful that
the water comes on \[every part of\] their hands.

§ 4. \[Should he be\] in doubt whether it \[the water\] has been used
for any purpose or not; \[should he be\] in doubt whether he had the
prescribed quantity or not; \[or should he be\] in doubt whether \[the
water was legally\] unclean or clean: in all these \[cases of\] doubt he
is clean, because they \[the sages\] decided, "That whenever it is
questionable whether the hands are unclean, \[or\] impart uncleanness,
or are clean, \[they are to be considered as\] clean." R. Jose
\[however\] held "\[That whenever it is questionable whether the hands
are\] clean, they are \[to be considered as\] unclean." How \[is this
rule to be applied\]? Were his hands clean, and two unclean loaves
before him, should he be in doubt whether he touched them or not,
\[or,\] his hands being unclean, and two clean loaves before him, he is
in doubt whether he touched them or not, \[ore\] one of his hands being
unclean and the other clean, there were before him two clean loaves, one
of which he touched, should he be in doubt whether he touched it with
the unclean \[hand\], or with the clean \[one\], \[or,\] his hands being
clean, and there were before him two loaves, one unclean and the other
clean, one of which he touched, should he be in doubt whether he touched
the unclean or the clean \[loaf, or,\] his hands being one unclean and
one clean, and before him two loaves, one unclean and one clean, both of
which he touched, should he be in doubt \[whether he touched\] the
unclean \[loaf\] with the unclean \[hand\], and the clean \[loaf\] with
the clean \[hand\], or the clean \[loaf\] with the unclean \[hand\], and
the unclean \[loaf\] with the clean \[hand\]: in all \[these cases\] the
hands remain as they were, and the loaves as they were. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1297"></span>[359:1](etm166.htm#fr_1302.md) Or, should a man
touch a loaf of heave after having performed his ablutions, but before
his hands are quite dry.

<span id="fn_1298"></span>[359:2](etm166.htm#fr_1303.md) As the splinter or
stone intervenes between his skin and the water, it annuls the effect of
the ablution, as the portion of his hand which it covers remains
untouched by the water, and therefore unclean. And should he even
perform the second ablution for heave, his hand still continues unclean,
the second water having the effect only of purifying the first water,
but not the hand.

<span id="fn_1299"></span>[360:3](etm166.htm#fr_1304.md) What was clean
remains so, and what was unclean also remains so.
