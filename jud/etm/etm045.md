*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER XXIII.

§ 1. A man may borrow of his acquaintance jars of wine or of oil,
provided he does not say to him, "Lend \[trust\] me;" likewise a woman
\[may borrow\] bread from her friends \[acquaintance\]; if he refuses to
trust him, he, \[the borrower\] may leave his *Taleth* \[upper garment
as a pledge\] with the lender, and settle his account with him after
Sabbath. Thus, likewise, in Jerusalem, if the eve of the passover falls
on the Sabbath, a man leaves his *Taleth* with the vendor, takes his
paschal lamb, and settles his account after the holy day,

§ 2. A man may verbally count the number of his guests, and also of his
additional dishes \[*hors d’œuvres*\], but he must not do it from a
written list. He may let his children and household draw \[cast\] lots
at table, \[as to who is to have part of one dish, and who is to have
part of another\], provided he does not \[with strangers\] intentionally
stake a larger portion against a smaller one, on account of
‏קוביא‎. <span id="fr_172"></span>[1](#fn_172)

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They may put lots
on the portions of sacrifices on the holy day, but not on the sacrifices
of the preceding day.

§ 3. He must not hire labourers on the Sabbath, nor may he commission
another to hire them for him. He must not stand \[waiting for\] the dusk
at techoom, <span id="fr_173"></span>[2](#fn_173) in order \[as soon as
the Sabbath goes out\] to hire labourers \[beyond the techoom\], or to
gather fruit \[beyond it\]; but he may await the nightfall at the
techoom, in order to watch \[fruit that is beyond it\]; and, in that
case, he may bring fruit back with him. Abbah Saul laid down the rule,
"Whatever I am permitted to prepare \[for the coming day\] on the
Sabbath, I may get ready for at nightfall."

§ 4. They may await the nightfall close to the techoom, to forward what
is necessary for a bride, and also what is necessary for a corpse, to
bring a coffin and shrouds for it. If a heathen has brought mourning
pipes \[instruments\] on the Sabbath, an Israelite must not mourn
\[play\] thereon, unless they be brought from the vicinity. If a coffin
has been made, and a grave dug for him \[a heathen\], an Israelite may
be buried therein, but if \[it has been done\] on purpose for an
Israelite, he must not at all be buried therein.

§ 5. They may do all that is needful to the corpse \[on the Sabbath\],
anoint and wash it, provided they do not strain its limbs. <span
id="fr_174"></span>[3](#fn_174) The pillow may be moved from under its
head; it may be put on sand, that it keep the longer \[from
putrefaction\]: its jaws may be tied, not to force them closer, but to
prevent them dropping lower. In like manner a beam that has been broken
\[cracked\] may be upheld \[supported\] by a stool or a bedstead, not
that it may again become erect, but that it do not break more. They must
not close the eyes of the dead on the Sabbath, nor \[yet\] on the
week-day, while he is expiring. Whoever closes the eyes of a dying
person the instant he expires, is as if he shed blood \[like a
murderer\].
