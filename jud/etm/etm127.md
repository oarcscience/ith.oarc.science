### CHAPTER VIII.

§. 1. \[Of\] a woman to whom property fell \[by inheritance or gift\]
before she was betrothed, Beth [Shammai](errata.htm#2.md) and Beth Hillel
agree, "That after she is betrothed, whether she sell \[the property\],
or give \[it\] away, it is valid." If it falls to her after she is
betrothed, Beth Shammai hold "That she \[has a right to\] sell;" but
Beth Hillel hold "She must not sell." Both however agree, "That if she
has sold, or given \[it\] away, \[her deed\] is valid." R. Jehudah
related, "They \[litigants\] pleaded before R. Gamaliel, 'As the man
acquires the wife\[’s person\], can it be \[right or reasonable\] that
he should not also acquire her property?' <span
id="fr_886"></span>[1](#fn_881.md) but R. Gamaliel replied, 'We feel
ashamed at the \[rights conceded to the husband on her\] new \[property
which falls to her after marriage\], and ye wish to impose on us \[the
task of conceding similar rights on\] her old \[property, which fell to
her after betrothment\].'" Should the property fall to her after
marriage. both \[Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel\] agree, "That whether she
sell or give \[it\] away, the husband recovers it from the holders."
\[Should

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

the property have fallen to her\] before she was married, R. Gamaliel
saith, "Whether after her marriage she sell \[the property\], or give
\[it\] away, \[her deed\] is valid." R. Hananiah ben Akivah related,
"They pleaded before Rabbon Gamaliel, 'As the man acquires the wife \['s
person\], can it be \[right or reasonable\] that he should not also
acquire her property?' <span id="fr_887"></span>[2](#fn_882.md) But Rabbon
Gamaliel replied, 'We feel ashamed at the \[rights conceded to the
husband on her\] new \[property which falls to her after marriage\], and
ye wish to impose on us \[the task of granting similar rights on\] her
old \[property which fell to her before marriage\].'"

§ 2. R. Simeon distinguishes <span id="fr_888"></span>[3](#fn_883.md)
between property and property. Such property as is known to the
husband <span id="fr_889"></span>[4](#fn_884.md) she must not sell, and
whether she sold or gave \[it away\], it is void. Such property as is
not known to the husband, <span id="fr_890"></span>[5](#fn_885.md) she must
not sell; but if she has sold or given \[it away\], it is valid.

§ 3. Should ready money fall to her \[as inheritance\], land is to be
purchased therewith, of which he \[the husband\] enjoys the usufruct;
should fruit that has been reaped \[gathered from the ground\] fall to
her, land is to be bought \[with the proceeds\] thereof, of which he
\[the husband\] enjoys the usufruct. \[As to\] fruit growing on the
ground, R. Meir saith, "They appraise the field, how much it is worth
with the growing fruit, and how much without \[it\], and for the
difference land is to be bought, of which he \[the husband\] enjoys the
usufruct." But the sages decide, "That the fruit growing on the ground
belong to him \[the husband\], but that fruit reaped \[gathered from the
ground\] belong to her \[the wife\], that land must be bought therewith,
of which he enjoys the usufruct."

§ 4. R. Simeon saith, "In cases where he \[the husband\] has the
advantage when he marries her, he is at a disadvantage if he divorces
her; and in cases where he is at a disadvantage when he marries her, he
has the advantage if he divorces her. Fruit growing on the ground belong
to him at the marriage, but at the \[time of\] divorce belong to her.
Whereas fruit reaped \[gathered from the ground\]

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

belong to her at the marriage, but at the \[time of\] divorce they
belong to him."

§ 5. Should aged bondmen or bondwomen fall to her \[by inheritance\],
they are to be sold to purchase land \[with the produce of the sale\],
of which he \[the husband\] enjoys the usufruct. But R. Simeon ben
Gamaliel saith, "She can forbid the sale, because they \[aged
servitors\] are an ornament to her father's house. Should old
olive-trees and vines fall to her, they are to be sold to purchase land,
of which he \[the husband\] enjoys the usufruct." R. Jehudah saith, "She
can forbid the sale, because they \[old trees\] are an ornament to her
father's house. Should a man incur an expense on his wife's property,
whether he has expended much, and reaped but little \[benefit\], or has
expended little and reaped much \[benefit\], what he has expended he has
expended, and what he has reaped he has reaped. <span
id="fr_891"></span>[6](#fn_886.md) Should he have incurred expense, and
reaped no benefit whatever, he must make oath to the amount of his
expenditure, and \[then\] recovers it out of the property."

§ 6 \[In the case of\] a woman who expects \[to be married by\] Yeboom,
and to whom property falls, Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel both agree,
"That whether she sell, or give \[it away, her deed\] is valid." Should
she die, how are they to dispose of her Ketubah, and of the property
which comes and goes with her? <span id="fr_892"></span>[7](#fn_887.md)
Beth Shammai hold, "The heirs of the husband share \[divide equally\]
with the heirs of the father;" but Beth Hillel hold, "That the property
reverts according to the original title. <span
id="fr_893"></span>[8](#fn_888.md) Her Ketubah of right reverts to the
heirs of the husband, and the property which comes and goes with her, of
right reverts to the heirs of the father." <span
id="fr_894"></span>[9](#fn_889.md)

§ 7. If his \[the Yabam's deceased\] brother left ready money, land must
be bought therewith, of which he enjoys the usufruct. \[If the deceased
left\] fruit, reaped \[gathered off the ground\], land must be bought
therewith, of which he \[the Yabam\] enjoys the usufruct. \[Respecting\]
fruit growing on the ground, R. Meir saith, "They

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

appraise the field, how much it is worth with the growing fruit, and how
much without \[it\], and for the difference land must be bought, of
which he \[the Yabam\] enjoys the usufruct." But the sages decide, "That
fruit growing on the ground belong to him, while that which has been
reaped \[gathered off the ground\] belong to whoever \[he or she\] first
obtains possession thereof. If he \[the Yabam\] first takes possession
thereof, they belong to him; if she \[the widow\] first takes possession
thereof, they belong to her; but \[in that case\] land must be bought
therewith, of which he enjoys the usufruct. After he has espoused her,
she is his wife to all intents, <span id="fr_895"></span>[10](#fn_890.md)
saving always that she has a lien \[for the amount of\] her Ketubah on
the property of her first husband."

§ 8. He cannot say to her, "There is \[the amount of\] thy Ketubah lying
on the table;" <span id="fr_896"></span>[11](#fn_891.md) but the whole of
his property remains liable for her Ketubah. \[Another version has,
"Moreover a man cannot say to his wife, 'There is \[the amount of\] thy
Ketubah lying on the table,' but the whole of his property remains
liable for her Ketubah"\]. Should he divorce her, she has no \[claim\]
beyond her Ketubah. If he takes her back, she is like all \[married\]
women, and has no \[claim\] beyond her Ketubah only.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_881"></span>[261:1](etm127.htm#fr_886.md) As by the act of
betrothing, and also by the marriage-rite, the husband acquires an
absolute and exclusive right to possess and enjoy the wife's person, it
follows that by the same act he acquires an equal right to her property,
which in fact is but an appendage to her person.

<span id="fn_882"></span>[262:2](etm127.htm#fr_887.md) Vide Note 1, [p.
260](etm126.htm#page_260.md).

<span id="fn_883"></span>[262:3](etm127.htm#fr_888.md) Establishes a
different rule of proceeding in differing cases.

<span id="fn_884"></span>[262:4](etm127.htm#fr_889.md) Real property to
which, he knows before marriage, that she must succeed, and which
knowledge may have influenced him in forming the alliance.

<span id="fn_885"></span>[262:5](etm127.htm#fr_890.md) Property which,
before marriage, he did not know she would inherit, and the expectation
of which cannot have influenced him in forming the matrimonial alliance.

<span id="fn_886"></span>[263:6](etm127.htm#fr_891.md) Both the expenditure
and the benefit are for his own account and risk, and he has no claim
upon the property for the surplus of expenditure over the benefit
enjoyed, any more than he is liable to any reclamation for the surplus
of the benefits enjoyed over his expenditure.

<span id="fn_887"></span>[263:7](etm127.htm#fr_892.md) Her personal estate
\[whether landed or otherwise\] which she brought her husband, and which
reverts to her in case of divorce, or at his death.

<span id="fn_888"></span>[263:8](etm127.htm#fr_893.md) and 9. ‏בחזקתן‎, its
inherent force, the source whence it originally was derived. The Ketubah
reverts to the husband who settled it on her; the personal estate to the
father, from whom, or whose relatives, it devolved to her.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[263:9](etm127.htm#fr_894.md) See previous note.

<span id="fn_890"></span>[264:10](etm127.htm#fr_895.md) And all her rights
merge in him.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[264:11](etm127.htm#fr_896.md) By means of such
tender to get rid of the liability.
