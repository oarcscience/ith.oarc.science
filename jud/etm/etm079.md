*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. An egg laid on the festival may be eaten thereon, according to Beth
Shammai; but Beth Hillel are of opinion, it may not be eaten. Beth
Shammai also decide, "that leaven of the size of an olive, and leavened
bread, of the size of a date, \[must be removed before Passover\];" but
Beth Hillel say, "both are to be removed when of the size of an olive
\[only\]."

§ 2. When a person wishes to kill on the festival a wild animal, or

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

fowl, he may, according to Beth Shammai, "remove with a spade, which had
been stuck in the ground \[before the festival\], the loose earth, and
cover the blood therewith." But Beth Hillel will not permit to kill on
the festival, unless the person has prepared the earth to cover with on
the day preceding the feast. Both colleges, however, agree that in case
a person did kill, he may dig with a spade to obtain earth to cover
with. Ashes from the hearth may be considered as "prepared" for use.

§ 3. Beth Shammai say, "It is prohibited to remove a ladder from one
dove-cote to another; it may, however, be removed from one opening to
another of the same dove-cote." But Beth Hillel allow both. Beth Shammai
say, "It is unlawful to remove the birds from their places, unless they
had been shaken \[or touched\] *before* the festival." <span
id="fr_408"></span>[1](#fn_407.md) But Beth Hillel say, "It is unnecessary
to do more than, standing before the next, <span
id="fr_409"></span>[2](#fn_408.md) to say, This and that bird will I take
for the festival."

§ 4. If a person who had prepared for the festival black pigeons, finds
white ones, or having prepared white pigeons, should find black ones; or
two birds, and he find three, they may not be used. If three birds had
been prepared, and two only are found, they may be used, but if they had
been "prepared" within the nest, and are found before the nest, they may
not be used, unless there were no other birds but these in the
dove-cote.

§ 5. The shutters of moveable stalls <span
id="fr_410"></span>[3](#fn_409.md) may not be removed on the festival
according to Beth Shammai; but Beth Hillel allow not only this, but also
to replace then. Beth Shammai say, "The \[large wooden\] pestle may not
be moved for the purpose of using it as a block to cut meat upon;" but
Beth Hillel allow it. Beth Shammai teach, "That it is unlawful to lay
down a skin to be trodden on \[as a preparation for its being tanned\],
or to raise it from the ground, unless the \[*minimum*\] quantity of
meat of the size of an olive be thereon;" but Beth Hillel allow it. Beth
Shammai teach, "That it is unlawful to carry out into a public place on
the festival, a child, a \[loolab\], or palm-branch, &c., or a roll of
the law;" but Beth Hillel allow it.

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

§ 6. Beth Shammai hold it to be unlawful to carry to the priest on the
festival ‏חלה‎, or other gifts \[belonging to the priests\], whether
they had been set apart for that purpose on that day, or on the day
previous; but Beth Hillel allow it. Beth Shammai alleged to them in
support of their decision, the similarity of expression in both, and
said, ‏חלה‎ and other priestly dues are called *gifts* \[‏מתנות‎\], due
to the priests: ‏תרומה‎, or heave-offering, is also one of these gifts;
now, even as heave-offering may not be carried to the priest on the
festival, thus must it be equally unlawful to bring to him any other
priestly "*gifts*" on that day. But Beth Hillel reply, "That which is
affirmed of the heave-offering cannot apply to the other gifts, <span
id="fr_411"></span>[4](#fn_410.md) for that cannot be incurred on the
festival, but the other gifts may."

§ 7. Beth Shammai say, "Spices may be pounded on the festival with a
wooden pestle only, and salt with an earthenware jug, or with a large
wooden spoon." But Beth Hillel say, "Spices may be, as usual, pounded
with a stone pestle, and salt with a wooden spoon."

§ 8. When a person picks pulse on the festival, he may, according to
Beth Shammai, only pick out the eatable part and eat it; but according
to Beth Hillel he may pick it as usual in his lap, in a basket with
holes, or in a large dish, but not on a large table, or through a small
or large sieve. Rabbon Gamaliel says, "It is lawful to pour water
thereon, and remove the part not fit to eat, by hand."

§ 9. Beth Shammai teach, "that it is unlawful for one person to send to
another as a present on the festival, any thing but eatables." <span
id="fr_412"></span>[5](#fn_411.md) Beth Hillel permit to send even cattle,
game, and poultry, <span id="fr_413"></span>[6](#fn_412.md) either dead or
alive; also, presents of wine, oil, fine flour, and pulse, but not
grain. <span id="fr_414"></span>[7](#fn_413.md) But R. Simeon permits also
to send grain. <span id="fr_415"></span>[8](#fn_414.md)

§ 10. It is also lawful to send clothes, sewed or not, even of "Kilaim,"
in case they are used on the festival, but not sandals with iron
nails, <span id="fr_416"></span>[9](#fn_415.md) or unsewed \[unfinished\]
shoes. R. Jehudah says,

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Neither may white
shoes be sent, because they require an artificer to make them fit for
use." <span id="fr_417"></span>[10](#fn_416.md) This is the general rule:
whatever can be used on the festival may be sent as a present thereon.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_407"></span>[145:1](etm079.htm#fr_408.md) To "prepare" them to
he used on the festival.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[145:2](etm079.htm#fr_409.md) Without actually
handling the birds.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[145:3](etm079.htm#fr_410.md) The stalls here
mentioned were used by spice vendors, they had the form of a box, with
moveable lids or partitions, which were taken out and used as a table to
expose thereon the spices for sale.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[146:4](etm079.htm#fr_411.md) And consequently
there is no similarity between them, inasmuch as the obligation to
separate the heave-offering cannot be incurred on the festival it being
unlawful to go to the heap of corn for that purpose (see further ch. V),
but the other gifts, such as ‏חלה‎, &c. *may* become obligatory,
inasmuch as it is permitted to kill cattle, and to make dough on the
festival.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[146:5](etm079.htm#fr_412.md) In slices, or
pieces.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[146:6](etm079.htm#fr_413.md) The whole carcase.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[146:7](etm079.htm#fr_414.md) Because that
requires grinding, which is not permitted on the festival.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[146:8](etm079.htm#fr_415.md) He allows it
inasmuch as it is possible that a small part may be pounded in a mortar
\[which is permitted\], and be made into a cake, to be eaten on the
festival.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[146:9](etm079.htm#fr_416.md) On account of an
event related in Treatise Sabbath, ch. VII. § 2.

<span id="fn_416"></span>[147:10](etm079.htm#fr_417.md) In the country or
place of R. Jehudah white shoes were not worn (Bartenora).
