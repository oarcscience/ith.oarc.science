<p>&sect; 1. He who introduces his hands into a house that is smitten&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1305"></A><A HREF="#fn_1300"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> [with leprosy, thereby causes] his hands [to become unclean in a] primary&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1306"></A><A HREF="#fn_1301"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> [degree]. Such is the dictum of R. Akivah; but the sages</p>

<p>decide, "[He causes] his hands [to become unclean in a] secondary&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1307"></A><A HREF="#fn_1302"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> [degree]." Whatever renders garments unclean&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1308"></A><A HREF="#fn_1303"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> at the time of [coming into] contact therewith, causes the hands to become unclean [in a] primary degree. Such is the dictum of R. Akivah; but the sages decide, "[It causes the hands] to become [unclean in a] secondary [degree]." They [the sages, moreover] said to R. Akivah, "When do we ever find [that] the hands [become unclean in a] primary [degree]?" He answered them, "How is it possible that they [the hands] can become [unclean in a] primary [degree] unless the whole body has [previously] become unclean, except in the present instance."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1309"></A><A HREF="#fn_1304"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Articles of food, and vessels which have become unclean through liquids, cause the hands to become unclean [in a] secondary [degree]. Such is the dictum of R. Joshua; but the sages decide, "That which is become unclean through an Ab Hatoomah&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1310"></A><A HREF="#fn_1305"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> makes the hands unclean; [but that winch is become] unclean through a Ab Hatoomah&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1311"></A><A HREF="#fn_1306"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> does not make the hands unclean." R. Simeon ben Gamaliel said, "It happened that a woman came before my father, and stated to him, 'My hands got into the empty space of an [unclean] earthen vessel:' he asked her, 'My daughter, from what [cause] did the uncleanness arise?' but I did not hear what she said to him." The sages replied, "The case is clear;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1312"></A><A HREF="#fn_1307"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> that which is become unclean through an Ab Hatoomah makes the hands unclean, [but that which is become unclean] through a Ab Hatoomah does not make the hands unclean."</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. Whatever disqualifies heave&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1313"></A><A HREF="#fn_1308"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> causes the hands to become</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> [unclean in a] secondary [degree]. One hand makes the other hand unclean. Such is the dictum of R. Joshua; but the sages decide, "That no secondary can make a secondary."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1314"></A><A HREF="#fn_1309"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> R. Joshua [objected and] said to them [the sages], "Are not sacred scriptures secondaries, and [nevertheless they do] make the hands unclean?"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1315"></A><A HREF="#fn_1310"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> [But] they answered him, "The commandments of the [written] law cannot be subjected to conclusions drawn from the dicta of the Sopherim [scribes], nor these dicta to those commandments, nor yet dicta of the Sopherim to others of their dicta."</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. Leather straps of Tephilin, with the Tephilin [attached thereto] make the hands unclean. R. Simeon saith, "The straps of Tephilin do not make the hands unclean."</p>  
<p>&sect; 4. The margin in a book of the Law, at the top and at the bottom, at the beginning and at the end [thereof], makes the hands unclean. R. Jose saith, "[The margin] at the end does not make the hands unclean until the roller is attached to it."</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. A book [of the Law, in] which [the writing] is obliterated, but which still contains eighty-five letters, [a number] equal to the Parasha &#8207;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; &#1489;&#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1506; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;&#8206;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1316"></A><A HREF="#fn_1311"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> makes the hands unclean. Any Megillah&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1317"></A><A HREF="#fn_1312"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> which contains eighty-five letters, [a number] equal to the above named Parasha, makes the hands unclean. All sacred scriptures make the hands unclean.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1318"></A><A HREF="#fn_1313"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> The Canticles and Ecclesiastes make the hands unclean. R. Jehudah saith, "Canticles make the hands unclean, but Ecclesiastes is [subject to] a dispute [difference of opinion]." R. Jos&eacute; saith, "Ecclesiastes does not make the hands unclean, but the Canticles are [subject to] a dispute." R. Simeon saith, "Ecclesiastes is one of [those observances in which] Beth Shammai [are] less strict, and Beth Hillel more rigid."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1319"></A><A HREF="#fn_1314"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> R. Simeon ben Azai said, "I have it as a tradition from the mouths of seventy-two elders, on the day they inducted R. Eleazar ben Azariah into the president's seat, that Canticles and Ecclesiastes [both] make</p>

<p>the hands unclean." R. Akivah said, "Mercy forbid! no man in Israel ever disputed that the Canticles make the hands unclean, as the whole [history of the] world does not [offer an epoch] equal to the day on which the [book] Canticles was given to Israel; for all the Kethoobim [Hagiographers] are holy, but the Canticles are holy of holies. The dispute [in question, therefore,] referred to Ecclesiastes [only]." R. Jochanan ben Joshua, the son of R. Akivah's father-in-law, said, "Even as Ben Azai stated, so was the dispute, and so was [also] the decision."</p>
