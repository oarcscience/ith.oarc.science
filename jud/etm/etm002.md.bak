# I. TREATISE BERACHOTH

###### CONTAINS LAWS FOR REGULATING THE DAILY PRAYERS AND THE RITUAL OF DIVINE WORSHIP.

### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. From what time is the ‏שמע‎ <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) to be
said in the evening? From the time the priests <span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md) again enter \[the sanctuary\] to eat their
heave offerings, until the close of the first watch <span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md) \[of the night\]. Such is the dictum of R.
Eleazar; but the sages say, "until midnight." Rabbon Gamaliel saith,
"until the break of dawn." It happened \[once\] that his sons returned
from a banquet \[after midnight\]. They said to him, "We have not yet
said the ‏שמע‎." He replied, "If the day is not yet dawned, ye are bound
to say it: and," added he, "not only in this \[instance\], but every
\[duty the performance of which\] the sages say \[is limited\] to
midnight only, the legal obligation does not cease until the break of
dawn. \[Thus in\] the burning of the fat and members \[of sacrifices\]
the legal obligation \[is in force\] till break of dawn. And all
\[offerings\] which must be eaten the slime day \[they have been
brought\] the legal obligation \[extends\] until the break of dawn."
Such being the case, why do the sages say "until midnight" only? To
withhold man from transgression.

§ 2. From what time is the ‏שמע‎ to be said in the morning? From the
time man can distinguish between blue and white. R. Eleazar saith,
"between blue and leek-green." And it may be said, "until the sun shines
forth \[over the mountain tops\]." R. Joshua saith, "until the third
hour," <span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#fn_4.md) for such is the habit of royal
princes who rise at the third hour. He who says the ‏שמע‎ after that
time loses nothing, \[but is\] like any man who reads in the Torah.

§ 3. Beth \[the school of\] Shammai hold, that in the evening, men are
to recline when they say the ‏שמע‎, and in the morning, they are to
stand upright; for it is said, "when thou liest down, and when thou
risest up." <span id="fr_5"></span>[5](#fn_5.md) But Beth Hillel hold, that
every man is to say it his own way, \[in what posture\] he pleases, for
it is said, "when thou walkest by the way." <span
id="fr_6"></span>[6](#fn_6.md) Such being the case, why \[then\] is it
said, "when thou liest down, and when thou risest up"? The meaning is,
at the time when mankind is in the habit to lie down, and at the time
when mankind is in the habit to rise. R. Tarphon said, "Once I came
along the road, and reclined, in order to say the ‏שמע‎, according to
the dictum of Beth Shammai; but I exposed myself to danger from
robbers." They \[the sages\] answered him, "Thou wast guilty against
thyself \[deserving of death\] because thou didst violate the decision
of Beth Hillel."

§ 4. In the morning, two benedictions are said before \[the ‏שמע‎\] and
one after it; and in the evening, two benedictions before and two after
it, one long and one short. <span id="fr_7"></span>[7](#fn_7.md) Where
they, the sages, have adopted the long \[form\] no man is authorised to
shorten \[use the short form\]; and where they have adopted the short
form no man is authorised to lengthen \[use the long form\]. \[Where
they\] close \[with a benediction\] no man is authorised not \[so\] to
close: and \[where they do\] not close \[with a benediction\] no man is
authorised \[so\] to close.

§ 5. The exit from Egypt is to be mentioned at night. R. Eleazar ben
Azariah saith, "Verily I am as a man of 70 years, \[almost 70 years of
age\], but have not succeeded \[to prove\] that the exit from Egypt
ought to be mentioned at night, until Ben Zoma \[thus\] expounded

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[the law\]: 'that
thou mayest remember the day of thy going forth from the land of Egypt
all the days of thy life.' <span id="fr_8"></span>[8](#fn_8.md) 'The days
of thy life,' would denote the days only; but \[the expression\] '*all*
the days of thy life' \[includes\] the nights \[likewise\]. But the
sages say, 'the days of thy life,' \[denote\] the world \[in its present
state\], whereas 'all the days of thy life' \[include\] the future days
of Messiah \[likewise\]."
