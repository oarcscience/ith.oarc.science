*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER III.

§ 1. On a double hearth \[range\], <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86)
cooked victuals may be put \[shortly before the Sabbath\], if it be
heated with stubble or brushwood; \[but if it be heated\] with
olive-kernels or wood, they must not put \[victuals thereon\], until
\[the lower compartment be\] cleaned out, or covered with ashes. Beth
Shammai hold \[that\] warm water \[only\], but not cooked victuals \[may
be placed on a hearth or range so heated\]; but Beth Hillel hold, that
\[both\] warm water and cooked victuals \[may be placed thereon\]. Beth
Shammai hold that they \[may\] take \[any thing\] off \[the hearth\],
but \[must\] not put \[it\] back \[thereon\]: but Beth Hillel hold that
they may also put \[it\] back.

§ 2. If an oven is heated with stubble or brushwood, nothing must be put
either into it or at the top of it. A single hearth which has been
heated with stubble or with brushwood, is \[considered\] like a double
one; but \[if heated\] with olive-kernels or wood, it is \[considered\]
like an oven.

§ 3. An egg must not be put at the side of a hot kettle \[on the
Sabbath\], that it become settled \[done\], nor must it be wrapped in

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

hot cloths \[with that intention\], nor must it be put into hot sand, or
road-\[side\] dust, that it \[the egg\] be roasted \[by the heat of the
sun.\]

§ 4. It once happened that the inhabitants of Tiberias carried a pipe of
cold water through an arm \[streamlet\] of their hot-well; but the sages
explained to them that on the Sabbath. \[this water\] like any \[other
that had been\] heated on the Sabbath-day, is prohibited, either for
washing or drinking; and that on festivals \[this water\] like any
\[other that had been\] heated on the festival, is prohibited for
washing, but permitted for drinking. A ‏מוליאר‎ <span
id="fr_87"></span>[2](#fn_87) that has been cleansed of coals \[it is
lawful to\] drink out of \[on the Sabbath\]; an ‏אנטיכי‎ <span
id="fr_88"></span>[3](#fn_88) even though it has been cleansed of coals
\[it is\] not lawful \[to drink out of\].

§ 5. \[Into the kettle of\] hot water, which has been removed \[from the
fire\], man must not pour \[a small quantity of\] cold water that it get
warm, but he may pour cold water into a kettle or goblet of warm water,
to make that tepid. <span id="fr_89"></span>[4](#fn_89) Into a pot or
kettle which has been moved \[from the fire\] boiling, he must not put
spice; but he may put \[spice to the warm victuals\] in a dish or on a
plate. R. Jehudah saith, "Into all \[kinds of vessels\] he may put
spice, except into \[such food\] things as contain vinegar or bran."

§ 6. It is not lawful to put a vessel underneath a lamp to catch the oil
\[that drops\], but if it has been \[so\] put while yet day \[before the
Sabbath come in\], it is permitted to let it remain; \[but the oil
caught therein\] no use must be made of, as it is not \[part\] of what
was prepared \[for the consumption of the Sabbath\]. A new lamp may be
moved \[from one place to another\], but not an old one \[that has
already been used\]. R. José saith, "All lamps may be moved, except such
as are alight for the Sabbath." A vessel may be placed under a lamp to
catch the sparks, but no water must be put therein, as that
extinguishes.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_86"></span>[41:1](etm025.htm#fr_86) A hearth \[range or
stove\] divided into two compartments: in the lower one fuel is put, and
in the upper one there is room for two dishes.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[42:2](etm025.htm#fr_87) A warming-pan with the
receptacle for the coals at the side; the heat of such a pan is much
less than that of an ‏אנטיכי‎.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[42:3](etm025.htm#fr_88) A double warming pan,
with the receptacle for coals between the two pans.
