*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER XIV.

§ 1. The eight kinds of vermin mentioned in the law <span
id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_145)—whoever catches or wounds one of them,
is guilty. As to all other kinds of reptiles, or worms, whoever wounds
\[bruises\] them is absolved; whoever catches them, if for use, is
guilty; if not for use, is absolved. Whoever catches animals, or birds,
that are \[already\] in his possession, is absolved; whoever wounds
\[bruises\] them is guilty.

§ 2. Man must not make \[prepare\] brine on the Sabbath; but he may make
\[mix\] salt and water wherein to dip his bread, and to put into his
food, to season it. R. José observed, "And is not this \[mixture\]
brine, whether it be more or less salted? The \[only mixture of\] salt
and water which is permitted \[on the Sabbath\], is that in which oil
has been previously put, either to the salt or to the water."

§ 3. It is unlawful to eat Greek hyssop on the Sabbath, because it is
not food \[fit\] for healthy \[people\]; but man may eat wild-rosemary,
and drink ‏אבוב רועה‎; <span id="fr_146"></span>[2](#fn_146) man may eat
of any \[kind of\] food as medicine, and drink any kind of beverage,
except water of ‏דקלים‎, <span id="fr_147"></span>[3](#fn_147) and ‏כוס
עקרים‎, <span id="fr_148"></span>[4](#fn_148) as these are \[only
remedies\] for the jaundice; but a man may drink the *water of Dekalim*
for thirst, and may anoint himself with the oil of *Ikkarim*, but not as
a remedy.

§ 4. He who has the toothache must not rinse his teeth with vinegar, but
he may wash them as usual \[dip something in vinegar and rub them\], and
if he does get cured, he does get cured. He who has pains in his loins,
must not rub them with wine or vinegar; he may \[however\] anoint them
with \[any kind of\] oil, except rose

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

oil. Princes may anoint \[dress\] their wounds with rose oil, as they
are in the habit of so anointing \[themselves\] on week-days. R. Simeon
saith, "All Israelites are \[to be considered as\] princes \[in this
respect\]."

<span id="fn_146"></span>[57:2](etm036.htm#fr_146) "Bloom of the herds;"

antidote against all pernicious liquids.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[57:3](etm036.htm#fr_147) "Water of trees;" the
Talmud explains this designation, by relating that in Palestine there is
a spring between two trees, the waters of which have the effect that the
first goblet promotes digestion, the second acts as a laxative, and the
third as an emetic.
