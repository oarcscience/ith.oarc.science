### CHAPTER IV.

§ 1. When a person received *Chalitzah* from his sister-in-law, and it
was subsequently ascertained that she was then pregnant: <span
id="fr_693"></span>[1](#fn_688.md) if she was delivered of a child she had
borne the full period of gestation, he may marry her relations, and she
his, nor is she thereby excluded from marrying a priest; but if the
child is prematurely born, then he may not marry her relations, nor she
his, and she is excluded from marrying a priest.

§ 2. When a person had married his sister-in-law \[by *Yeboom*\], and
she proved to have then been pregnant, the marriage must be dissolved,
if she be delivered of a child at the full period of gestation, and both
must bring a sin-offering; but if the child is prematurely born, the
marriage need not be dissolved; if it be doubtful whether the child was
born from the first husband in the ninth month, or from the second, in
the seventh month, the marriage must be dissolved, but the child is
legitimate, and both must bring the doubtful trespass-offering.

§ 3. In the case of property accruing to a woman, whilst waiting to be
married by *Yeboom*, the schools of Shammai and Hillel agree, that she
is entitled to sell it or give it away. How are they to act in case of
the death of such a woman, <span id="fr_694"></span>[2](#fn_689.md) with
the amount of her dowry to which she is entitled by her *Ketubah*, and
the private property she brings in with her \[on her marriage\], and
takes back again \[in case of divorce\]? Beth Shammai decide, that it
must be divided between her husband's, and her father's heirs. But Beth
Hillel

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

teach, that her private property remains in its existing power, <span
id="fr_695"></span>[3](#fn_690.md) her marriage portion in that of the
heirs of her husband, and the property she brings and takes back with
her, in that of her father's heirs.

§ 4. As soon as a brother-in-law has married a woman by *Yeboom* \[and
consummated the marriage\], she must be considered as his wife in every
respect, except that the portion allowed her in her marriage contract is
to be charged on her late husband's property.

§ 5. The duty of *Yeboom* is obligatory in the first place on the eldest
brother; should he refuse, all the other brothers must be applied to; if
they also refuse, they must apply again to the eldest, and say unto him,
"The obligation is incumbent on you, \[therefore\] either receive
*Chalitzah* from your sister-in-law, or marry her by *Yeboom*."

§ 6. If he delays, under the pretext of waiting till a young brother
grows up, or till an older brother returns from beyond the seas, <span
id="fr_696"></span>[4](#fn_691.md) or until a deaf or foolish brother is
cured, his excuse is not to be noticed, but they shall say to him, "The
obligation is incumbent on you: either receive *Chalitzah* from your
sister-in-law, or marry her by *Yeboom*."

§ 7. A person who received *Chalitzah* from his sister-in-law, remains
in respect to the inheritance \[of his deceased brother's property\]
upon an equal footing with his other brothers; but if their father is
yet alive, he inherits it; but he that married his sister-in-law by
*Yeboom* acquires thereby all his brother's property. R. Jehudah saith,
"In either case, should the father still be alive, the property devolves
on him." When a person has received *Chalitzah* from his sister-in-law,
he may not marry her relations, nor she his. <span
id="fr_697"></span>[5](#fn_692.md) He may not marry her mother, nor her
grandmother \[whether her mother's or her father's mother\], her
daughter, or grand-daughter, whether of son or of daughter, or her
sister, whilst she is alive. His brothers may marry her, but she may not
marry his father, nor his grandfather, whether his father's or mother's
father, his son, his son's son, his brother, or his brother's son. It is
lawful, however, to marry the

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

relations of the rival of the woman from whom a person has received
*Chalitzah*, but not the rivals of the relation of the woman from whom
he received *Chalitzah*. <span id="fr_698"></span>[6](#fn_693.md)

§ 8. If the brother of one who had *Chalitzah* performed to him by his
sister-in-law, marries her sister and dies, she is bound to perform
*Chalitzah*, but may not be married to her brother-in-law by *Yeboom*,
but when a person had divorced his wife, and his brother marries her
sister and dies, she is released both from *Chalitzah* and from
*Yeboom*.

§ 9. In case the sister of a woman in expectation of being married by
*Yeboom* to her brother-in-law, should meanwhile have been betrothed to
another brother, it is taught in the name of R. Jehudah ben Beterah that
they shall admonish him to delay his marriage until the elder brother
proceeds to an act \[i.e. that of *Yeboom* or of *Chalitzah*\]. As soon
as he \[the elder brother\] has received *Chalitzah* from, or married
his sister-in-law by *Yeboom*, the other brother may marry his betrothed
also, in case the widow should have died; but if the brother-in-law
died, <span id="fr_699"></span>[7](#fn_694.md) he must divorce his
betrothed and receive *Chalitzah* from his sister-in-law. <span
id="fr_700"></span>[8](#fn_695.md)

§ 10. Women who have become subject to *Yeboom*, may not proceed to it
or to the ceremony of *Chalitzah* until after three months have elapsed
\[since the death of their husbands\], other women also shall not be
betrothed nor married \[again\] till after three months, whether they
were virgins <span id="fr_701"></span>[9](#fn_696.md) or not, whether
divorced or widowed,

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

married or only betrothed. R. Jehudah says, "Women who had already been
married may be betrothed immediately, and the betrothed ones married,
except the betrothed in Judah, for there the intercourse of the
bridegroom with his betrothed is less restrained." R. José says, "All
women may be immediately betrothed, except a widow, on account of the
mourning \[she is bound to observe for her deceased husband\]."

§ 11. When four \[of a number of\] brethren die, who had been married to
four women, the eldest \[survivor\] may marry all four by *Yeboom*, if
he wishes it. If a person left two wives at his decease, the marriage by
*Yeboom* or *Chalitzah* by one, releases her rival. If one is qualified
to be married to a priest, and the other is not; if the brother-in-law
receives *Chalitzah*, he must receive it of her who may not be married
to a priest; but if he prefers to marry by *Yeboom*, he can take her who
is qualified \[to be married to a priest\].

§ 12. When a person takes back his divorced wife, or one who had married
the woman from whom he received *Chalitzah*, or her relation, <span
id="fr_702"></span>[10](#fn_697.md) the marriage must be dissolved, and the
issue from such a marriage are bastards, according to R. Akivah; but the
sages say they are not bastards: they agree, however, that the child of
one who had married a relation of the woman from whom he received
*Chalitzah* is a bastard.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[209:1](etm108.htm#fr_693.md) Was left pregnant by
the first husband, and performed *Chalitzah* within three months of her
husband's decease.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[209:2](etm108.htm#fr_694.md) After her
brother-in-law had promised her marriage, but did not consummate it. Who
are her legal heirs?

<span id="fn_690"></span>[210:3](etm108.htm#fr_695.md) It must be shared
among those who have an existing right to it, namely,—her heirs; because
the property is derived from her; and also his heirs, as the risk of the
property is on them. But the school of Hillel has left it undecided,
whether all the heirs are to share alike. (See further, Treatise
Ketuboth, chap. III. § 6.)

<span id="fn_691"></span>[210:4](etm108.htm#fr_696.md) A distant country,
or out of Palestine. See Gitten, chap. I.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[210:5](etm108.htm#fr_697.md) As if she were
actually his wife.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[211:6](etm108.htm#fr_698.md) The reason of this
seems to he founded rather on an apprehension that the real facts of the
case might be misconceived, or rather misrepresented, than on any real
legal prohibition. To explain this rather intricate case, Rashi,
Bartenora, and other commentators of the Mishna, have illustrated it by
the following example:—Suppose A to be a man who received *Chalitzah*
from his sister-in-law B, whose sister C, married to a man not related
to the sisters before marriage, has a rival named D; then A may not
marry D in the event of her husband's death; because, as both sisters, B
and C, appeared before the public tribunal when the *Chalitzah* was
performed by B, every one might not be aware of that fact, and may
suppose it to have been performed by C, so that if A marries her rival
D, who is *the rival of the relation* of her of whom he received
*Chalitzah*, people might say he married her rival \[which is
prohibited\], for they suppose that C and D were the wives of the
deceased brother of A, because \[as they think\] A received the
*Chalitzah* from C; but this misapprehension cannot take place in case
of marrying a sister of the rival, because the women who perform the
ceremony of *Chalitzah* before the public tribunal are not in the habit
of bringing their rivals with them.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[211:7](etm108.htm#fr_699.md) Namely, the eldest,
on whom the duty of *Yeboom* is incumbent.

<span id="fn_695"></span>[211:8](etm108.htm#fr_700.md) This is limited to
the case of his being the only surviving brother.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[211:9](etm108.htm#fr_701.md) When she had been
only betrothed, and he who betrothed her had died or divorced her.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[212:10](etm108.htm#fr_702.md) Which, even as the
preceding, is unlawful.
