<p>&sect; 1. It is prohibited to catch fish from ponds on the festival, or to feed them on that day;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_431"></A><A HREF="#fn_430"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> but it is lawful to catch wild animals or fowls in enclosed parks or aviaries, and to provide them with food.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_432"></A><A HREF="#fn_431"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Rabbon Simeon, son of Gamaliel, says, "All fish-ponds and enclosures are not [to be considered in] the sane [light], this is the general rule: if the fish or animals therein require [on account of its extent], to be chased, or some device to be used, in order to take them, they may not be taken on the festival; but it is lawful to take them if they do not require such pursuit or device to be used."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_433"></A><A HREF="#fn_432"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 2. It is unlawful to take on the festival from nets which have been spread on the previous day, any fish, wild animal, or fowl, which may have become entangled therein, unless it is known</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></A></p>  
<p>that they had been caught in the nets previous to the commencement of the festival. It once happened that a heathen brought, on the festival, a present of fish to Rabbon Gamaliel; when the latter said, "It is lawful to use them, but I do not wish to accept presents from that man."</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. It is unlawful to kill on the festival any animal labouring under a mortal disease, unless there is time to eat thereof on that day, the [<i>minimum</i>] quantity of the size of an olive of roasted meat; Rabbi Akivah allows it, if there be only sufficient time to eat thereof a piece of the size of an olive of raw meat, even in the very place in which it is slaughtered. If it had been killed in the fields, the whole [carcase] may not be carried home on a staff or stick, but piecemeal, by hand.</p>  
<p>&sect; 4. If a first-born animal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_434"></A><A HREF="#fn_433"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> fall into a pit or hole on the festival, [and the owner is afraid it should die there], R. Jehudah says, "An expert person must go down, and see whether it had [already] an incurable and permanent injury, in which case, it may be drawn up and killed, but not otherwise." Rabbi Simeon says, "If the defect or injury had not been known [for <i>certain</i>] to exist thereon, previous to the festival, and to be of a permanent nature, the animal cannot be considered as <i>prepared</i> for the feast."</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. An animal [consecrated for sacrifice] which had died on the festival, may not be removed thereon. It happened once, when Rabbi Tarphon was questioned on the subject, and also concerning a separated piece of dough [&#8207;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;&#8206;] which had become polluted, he went to the &#8207;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#8206; [college of the Rabbins] and enquired: they told him, "They may not be removed from the spot."</p>  
<p>&sect; 6. An association for the purpose of jointly purchasing an animal, may not be formed on the festival; but if it was made before the festival, the animal so purchased may be slaughtered and shared on the festival. Rabbi Jehudah says, "It is lawful to weigh meat against a vessel or hatchet;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_435"></A><A HREF="#fn_434"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> but the sages say it is unlawful to use the scales at all.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_436"></A><A HREF="#fn_435"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 7. Knives may not be ground or set on the festival; but it is</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></A></p>  
<p>lawful to sharpen one knife with the other. It is not allowed to say to a butcher, "Weigh, or sell me for a denar&#8217;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_437"></A><A HREF="#fn_436"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> worth of meat," but [the butcher] has the animal killed, and shares it among&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> [his customers].</p>  
<p>&sect; 8. One person may say to another [on the festival], "Fill me this vessel," but it must not be a vessel appropriated to measure with. R. Jehudah says, "If a measure is used, it must not be quite filled." Abba Saul, the son of Botnit, used to fill his measures on the day before the festival, and delivered them to his customers on the festival; Abba Saul says, "He used to do so even on the middle-days,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_439"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> on account of the froth in the measure;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_440"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> the sages say he even did so on week-days, in order to let out the entire contents of his measure into the vessels of his customers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_441"></A><A HREF="#fn_440"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> It is lawful to go to a shop-keeper, with whom one is used to deal, and to say to him, "Give me so many [mentioning the number] eggs or nuts," because the master of a house is used to count similar articles by number.</p>
