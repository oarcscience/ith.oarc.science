### CHAPTER V.

§ 1. How can the bounds of a town be enlarged \[extended\]? If one house
recede \[from the city wall\], and \[another\] house project
\[therefrom\], or if a ruin recede or project, or if fragments of a wall
ten hands high \[lie beyond the walls\], or if there be any bridges or
cemeteries, with dwelling-houses thereon, the measurement of the town is
commenced from them; and the whole is formed into a kind of square, in
order to gain the angles.

§ 2. An allowance of \[seventy and two-thirds amoth\] space must be made
to the town. Such is the dictum of R. Meir; but the sages hold, "that
such an allowance is to be made only if two towns be so close to each
other, that each only requires seventy and two-thirds

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

amoth \[to bring them within techoom; in that case\] an allowance is
made to both, \[so that they become\] as one."

§ 3. So likewise, if three villages form a triangle, and the two outer
ones require 14⅓ amoth, \[a double allowance to bring them within
techoom of each other\], he \[in idea\] places the third one between
them, so that the three become as if they were one.

§ 4. They are not to measure \[the techoom\], except with a line
\[exactly\] fifty amoth long, neither more nor less; and he \[who
measures\] must not measure except from his breast. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_217.md) If, during the measurement, he arrives
at a deep dale \[cleft\], or heap of stones, he passes \[his line\] over
it, and resumes his measurement, if he arrive at a hillock, he passes
\[his line\] over it, and resumes his measurement, provided always he
does not outstep the techoom \[in so doing\]. If he cannot pass \[his
line\] over \[the hillock, because it is too high\], R. Dostai bar Janai
said of such, \[a circumstance\] I have heard on the authority of R.
Meir, "that they \[who measure\] cut straight through the mountain \[in
idea\]."

§ 5. The measurement must be undertaken by him only who is expert \[in
measuring land\]. \[If the techoom has been carried\] farther to one
place, and less far to another, they abide by the farther
\[measurement\] . If one surveyor \[has carried the limit\] farther than
another, they abide by the farther \[measurement\]. Even a bond-man or a
bond-woman is credible \[entitled to belief\], if either say, "Until
here, is a techoom Sabbath;" for the sages did not intend to enforce a
more rigid observance, but to make it more easy.

§ 6. If a town \[originally the property\] of a single individual,
becomes \[property\] of the public, all \[the householders residing
thereon\] must join in preparing the erub. \[Should the town originally
have been property\] of the public, and is become \[property\] of one
individual, all \[the householders\] are not to join in the erub, but
\[a number\] must be left out equal to the new town in Judæa, in which
there are fifty dwellings. Such is the dictum of R. Jehudah; but R.
Simeon holds, "\[it is sufficient if\] three courts, with two houses in
each \[are left out\]."

§ 7. Should a man \[on the eve of the day of rest\] be at the east \[of
his habitation\], and say to his son, "Place my erub towards the west;"
or \[being\] to the west \[of his habitation\], he say to his son,

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Place my erub to
the east;" if \[the distance\] from the place where he is to his
habitation is \[within\] 2000 amoth, and to his erub further than that,
he must take his Sabbath-rest <span id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_218.md) at
his habitation, but must not take it at his erub; \[if the distance\] to
his erub be \[within\] 2000 amoth, and to his habitation further than
that, he must take \[his Sabbath-rest\] at his erub, but must not take
it at his habitation. If a man has deposited his erub within the limits
of a town, he has \[in law\] done nothing, and it is nothing; if he has
deposited it \[the erub\] out of the techoom, even though but a single
amah, whatever extent of ground he gains in this direction, he loses in
the opposite one. <span id="fr_219"></span>[3](#fn_219.md)

§ 8. The inhabitants of a large town may traverse the whole of a small
town \[that lies within or adjoining their techoom\], but the
inhabitants of the small \[town\] must not traverse the whole extent of
the large town. <span id="fr_220"></span>[4](#fn_220.md) How are they to
do? If an inhabitant of the large town place his erub in the small town,
or an inhabitant of the small town place his in the large towel, each
may traverse either town, and proceed 2000 amoth beyond its confines. R.
Akivah saith, "He has only \[the right to proceed\] 2000 amoth from the
place where he deposited his erub."

§ 9. R. Akivah said to them \[the sages\], "Will ye not grant me, in the
case of him who deposits his erub in a cavern, that he has not \[the
right to proceed\] further than 2000 amoth from the place where he has
\[left\] his erub?" They replied "\[True; but\] when is this the case?
if there are no habitations within the cavern; but if there are
habitations \[prepared\] within it, <span
id="fr_221"></span>[5](#fn_221.md) he may not only traverse the whole of
the cavern, but also proceed 2000 amoth outside of it." \[Consequently,
the observance\] is found less rigid as to the interior \[of a cavern\],
than as to \[the space\] above \[it\]. As to him who measures \[spoken
of before\], he is only allowed \[to carry the techoom\] 2000 amoth
\[from the place whence he started\], even though the end of his
measurement should terminate in a cavern.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_217"></span>[82:1](etm052.htm#fr_217.md) That is to say, while
measuring he invariably holds the line to his breast; this has been
enacted to ensure an uniformity in the measuring.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[83:2](etm052.htm#fr_218.md) The spot from whence
he is entitled to proceed 2000 amoth, in any direction, on the day of
rest.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[83:3](etm052.htm#fr_219.md) The techoom becomes
diminished (to him individually) in one direction, by the same extent
that he has enlarged it in the opposite direction.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[83:4](etm052.htm#fr_220.md) They must not exceed
their legal Sabbath distance of 2000 amoth from the bounds of their
town.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[83:5](etm052.htm#fr_221.md) In Palestine there
are many spacious caverns which are prepared so as to be fit for human
habitations; they have frequently been inhabited, particularly in times
of religious persecution.
