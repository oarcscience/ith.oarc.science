------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER II.

§ 1. What is the order of the \[seven last\] fast-days? The ark
containing the rolls of the law is to be brought in an open place of the
city; ashes of burnt \[substances\] are to be strewed on the heads of
the \[‏נשיא‎\] prince, and of the chief of the tribunal of justice, and
other persons shall also put ashes on their heads; the eldest among them
shall then address them in heart-moving terms: "My brethren, consider
that it is not written in respect to \[the repentance of\] the
Ninevites, that God regarded their having wrapped themselves in
sackcloth, and considered their fast-days, but that 'God saw their
*acts*, and that they had turned from their evil ways' (Jonah iii. 10),
and the tradition of the prophets also is, 'Tear your hearts, and not
your garments' (Joel ii. 13)."

§ 2. When they have stood up to pray, they shall place at the
reading-desk to minister an old experienced person, who has children,
and whose house or family is free \[from transgression\], so that his
mind may be entirely devoted to his prayer: he shall say twenty-four
blessings, namely, the eighteen blessings of the daily prayer
\[Amidah\], to which he shall add six more.

§ 3. Which are as follows:—texts of ‏זכרונות‎ and ‏שופרות‎ <span
id="fr_529"></span>[1](#fn_526.md) \[the Psalms cxx., cxxi., cxxx., and
cii.), "In my distress I cried unto the Lord, and he answered me," &c.,
"I raise my eyes unto the hills," &c., "Out of the depths have I cried
unto thee, O Lord," &c., "A prayer for the afflicted when he is
overwhelmed," &c. R. Jehudah says it was not necessary to mention the
‏זכרונות‎ and ‏שופרות‎, but the following passages instead are to he
read, "When there is famine in the land, when there is pestilence in the
land," &c. (1 Kings viii. 37), and, "The word of the Lord that came to
Jeremiah concerning the dearth," &c. (Jer. xiv.), the concluding
blessing is then added to each.

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

§ 4: To the first blessing <span id="fr_530"></span>[2](#fn_527.md) he
shall say \[in addition\], "May he who answered Abraham on Mount Moriah
answer you, and listen to your \[petition and\] cry on this day. Blessed
art thou, O Lord, Redeemer of Israel!" To the second he shall say, "May
he who answered our ancestors on the Red Sea answer you, and listen
favourably this day to your cry. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who
rememberest all things forgotten \[by man\]!" To the third he shall say,
"May he who answered Joshua in Gilgal answer you, and listen
\[favourably\] this day to your cry. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who
deignest to listen to the sound of the shophar!" To the fourth he shall
say, "May he who answered Samuel in Mizpah answer you, and listen
\[favourably\] to your cry on this day. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who
hearkenest to \[our\] cry!" To the fifth he shall say, "May he who
answered Elijah on Mount Carmel answer you, and listen \[favourably\] to
your cry on this day. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hearkenest to
prayer!" To the sixth he shall say, "May he who answered Jonah in the
entrails of the fish answer you, and listen \[favourably\] to your cry
on this day. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who answerest in the time of
distress!" To the seventh <span id="fr_531"></span>[3](#fn_528.md) he shall
say, "May he who answered David, and his son Solomon, in Jerusalem
answer you, and listen \[favourably\] to your cry on this day. Blessed
art thou, O Lord, who hast compassion on the earth!"

§ 5. It happened in the times of R. Halaphta and R. Hanina, son of
Teradion, that a minister advanced to the reading-desk and finished the
whole of the blessing without any \[of the congregation\] answering
thereupon, "Amen:" <span id="fr_532"></span>[4](#fn_529.md) \[a minister
called\], "Sound, O priests! sound!" \[the minister who said the prayers
continued\], "May he who answered our father Abraham on Mount Moriah
answer you, and listen \[favourably\] to your prayer this day:" \[a
minister called\] "Sound an alarm, sons of Aaron! sound an alarm!" \[the
minister

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

who said the prayers continued\], "May he who answered our ancestors on
the Red Sea answer you, and listen \[favourably\] to your cry this day."
When the sages were informed of this, they said, "This was not our
custom, except at the eastern door \[of the Temple\], and on the
Temple-mountain \[Mount Moriah\]."

§ 6. On the three first fasts, the priests who had the weekly watch of
the Temple <span id="fr_533"></span>[5](#fn_530.md) fasted, but not the
whole day; and the ministering priests did not fast at all. On the
second three fasts, the priests on the weekly duty fasted the whole day;
and the ministering priests fasted, but not the whole day. But on the
last seven, both classes of priests fasted the whole day. Such is the
opinion of R. Joshua; but the sages say, "The three first fasts were not
kept by any of the said priests: on the second three, the priests who
had the weekly duty used to fast, but not the whole day; and the
officiating priests did not fast at all. On the last seven, the priests
on the weekly duty fasted the whole day; and the officiating priests
fasted, but not the whole day."

§ 7. The priests on the weekly duty may drink wine at night, but not
during the day; <span id="fr_534"></span>[6](#fn_531.md) the officiating
priests may not drink it either by day or night. The priests of the
weekly watch, and the standing men <span id="fr_535"></span>[7](#fn_532.md)
are prohibited from shaving their beards, and washing their clothes;
but, on Thursday, <span id="fr_536"></span>[8](#fn_533.md) they are allowed
to do so, in honour of the \[approaching\] Sabbath.

§ 8. Wherever it is mentioned in "The Roll of Fasts," <span
id="fr_537"></span>[9](#fn_534.md) that "no lamentation and mourning is to
be made" on certain days, it is also prohibited to do so on the day
preceding, but allowed on the day following them; but R. José says, "It
is prohibited to do so on the

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

day preceding, and on the day following; where it is said, that 'no
fasts are to be kept thereon,' it is allowed to fast on the day
preceding and following days." R. José says, "It is prohibited on the
preceding, but allowed on the following day."

§ 9. Public fasts are not to be ordered to commence on a Thursday, in
order not to raise the price of victuals in the markets; <span
id="fr_538"></span>[10](#fn_535.md) but the first fasts are to be on
Monday, Thursday, and \[the following\] Monday; but the second three
fasts may follow on Thursday, Monday, and \[the following\] Thursday. R.
José says, "Even as the first fasts are not to be commenced on Thursday,
so also are the second and last fasts not to commence on that day."

§ 10. Public fasts are not to be ordered to take place on the feast of
new moon, nor on that of dedication and of lots \[pureem\]; but if the
fast has been already commenced thereon, it need not be broken. Such is
the opinion of Rabbon Gamaliel. R. Meir says, "Although Rabbon Gamaliel
has said that the fast need not be broken, he agrees that on these days
they are not to fast the whole of the day; and thus is it with the
\[fast of the\] ninth of Ab, when it happens on a Friday." <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_526"></span>[170:1](etm091.htm#fr_529.md) Texts relating to
the kind remembrance of God to his creatures, and those in which the
sounding of the shophar is mentioned; the texts of this kind which are
read in the ‏מוסף‎ of ‏ראש השנה‎, are also to be used on this occasion.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[171:2](etm091.htm#fr_530.md) Commencing ‏ראה נא
בענינו‎, which although not the first in the Amidah, is the first in
which the interpolations of the additional part are introduced.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[171:3](etm091.htm#fr_531.md) Although but six
additional blessings are to be said on these fast-days, yet this is
called the seventh, in respect to its being the seventh blessing in
which additional matter is introduced; for the first blessing ending
‏גואל ישראל‎, "Redeemer of Israel," is one of the eighteen blessings of
the daily Amidah.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[171:4](etm091.htm#fr_532.md) They answered
instead, ‏ברוך שם כבוד מלכותו לעולם ועד‎, "Blessed be the name of the
glory of his kingdom for ever and ever," which was the response made in
the Temple, where *alone* the sacred name was pronounced.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[172:5](etm091.htm#fr_533.md) The priests were
divided into twenty-four ‏משמרות‎, each of which ministered a week in
the Temple; each ‏משמרה‎ was again subdivided into seven ‏בתי אבות‎,
each ‏בית אב‎ officiating on a day in the week, in their regular turn.
The ‏בית אב‎, being thus the active and officiating priests, have
permission to fast on only part of the day, that they may be fit for
their holy ministration.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[172:6](etm091.htm#fr_534.md) This does not relate
to the fasts; but general regulations are here stated.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[172:7](etm091.htm#fr_535.md) A number of
Israelites attended at every public sacrifice, as representatives of the
general body of the nation, to pray that the sacrifice offered for the
nation might be favourably accepted; they are called ‏אנשי מעמד‎,
standing men, because they stood near the priests during the sacrifice.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[172:8](etm091.htm#fr_536.md) In order to compel
their to come to the Temple clean.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[172:9](etm091.htm#fr_537.md) There was a book so
called, in which all remarkable days were enumerated. From extracts
given in the Mishna, it appears that this book, or roll, was written in
Chaldee.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[173:10](etm091.htm#fr_538.md) The price of food
would rise considerably in the markets, when the sellers conjectured
that the accounts received by the Sanhedrin of the existing and probable
future distress of the country, through the want of rain, was so
serious, as to induce them to order a general fast so near the Sabbath.
Another reason why it should not commence on a Thursday is, that this
fear of dearth by the sellers, or the advantage they might take of this
circumstance, would be increased by an additional demand for food, as
the people would have to provide themselves for the evening of the fast,
and for that on the following Sabbath.

<span id="fn_536"></span>[173:11](etm091.htm#fr_539.md) This cannot happen
at present, but might formerly, when the Sanhedrin fixed the day of the
Feast of New Moon by the evidence of witnesses who had seen it.
