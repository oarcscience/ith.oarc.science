*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER II.

§ 1. When a person who brings a Get from a foreign country declares, "It
was written, but not signed in my presence," or the reverse, or, "The
whole \[Get\] was written, but only in part attested <span
id="fr_990"></span>[1](#fn_985.md) in my presence," or, "Only half of the
writing \[of the Get\] but the whole of the signatures were written in
my presence," it is void. <span id="fr_991"></span>[2](#fn_986.md) Also in
case one \[witness\] says, "It was written," and another, "It was signed
in my presence." When two say, "It was written in our presence," and
one, "It was signed in my presence," it is also void. But R. Jehudah
declares it valid. When one declares, "It was written in my presence,"
and two declare "It was signed in our presence," it is valid.

§ 2. If it were both written and signed in the day time, <span
id="fr_992"></span>[3](#fn_987.md) or that both writing and signatures were
done at night, <span id="fr_993"></span>[4](#fn_988.md) or that it was

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

written at night, but signed by day, it is valid. <span
id="fr_994"></span>[5](#fn_989.md) If it were written by day, but signed at
night, it is void, <span id="fr_995"></span>[6](#fn_990.md) but R. Simeon
declares it valid; for he established it as a rule "That all documents
written by day and signed at night are void, except letters of divorce."

§ 3. The writing of a Get may be done with any material, with ink,
paint, <span id="fr_996"></span>[7](#fn_991.md) ruddle, gum, or with
vitriol black, and with every other indelible material, but not with any
liquor, the juice of fruit, nor with any delible material. It may be
written on any thing, even on a leaf of an olive tree or on a cow's
horn. In the latter case, however, the husband is bound to give her
\[the wife\] the cow along with it. He may write it on the hand of a
slave, but then he must give her the slave also; but R. José prohibits
the writing of a Get on any thing endowed with life, or on edible
articles.

§ 4. A Get may not be written on any thing that is yet attached or fixed
to the soil. If it was so written, and it was afterwards severed from
the soil, and then signed and delivered to the woman, it is valid. But
R. Jehudah declares it void, for it must be written and signed on what
is detached from the soil. R. Jehudah ben Beterah saith, "It must not be
written on papyrus, on which an erasure or abrasion appears, nor on
unfinished vellum, because it affords opportunity for falsification;"
but the sages permit it.

§ 5. All are qualified to write a Get, even deaf and dumb, or foolish
persons and minors. A woman may write her own Get, and the husband his
acquittance \[for the amount of the Ketubah he has paid her\], because
the validity of legal documents depends solely on the signature of the
attesting witnesses. All are qualified \[to act as missionaries or
agents\] to bring over a Get, except deaf and dumb or foolish persons,
minors, a blind person, and a non-Israelite.

§ 6. When a minor received \[a commission to deliver\] a Get and became
of age \[before he delivered it\], or a deaf person whilst in that
state, and who afterwards recovered his hearing, or a blind person <span
id="fr_997"></span>[8](#fn_992.md) who subsequently recovered his sight, or
a demented person, who

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

was afterwards cured, or a non-Israelite, <span
id="fr_998"></span>[9](#fn_993.md) who subsequently became a proselyte, the
Get is void. But when a person received it whilst in possession of his
faculty of hearing, and before he delivered he became deaf, and again
recovered his hearing, or a person who could see, had become blind, and
again recovered his sight, or a person of sound mind who had become
demented, and was cured: the Get is valid, because the rule is, that
when the commencement and end <span id="fr_999"></span>[10](#fn_994.md) of
the act took place, whilst the person was in possession of his
faculties, it is valid.

§ 7. Those females who are not considered competent witnesses to testify
to a woman in respect to the decease of her husband, <span
id="fr_1000"></span>[11](#fn_995.md) are to be credited when \[as
messengers\] they bring over a Get to her, viz., her mother-in-law, the
daughter of her mother-in-law, her rival, the wife of her husband's
brother, and her husband's daughter. Why is this difference in respect
to the evidence as to a Get, or as to the death of a husband? Because
there is \[in the first mentioned case\] a document in existence to
confirm the evidence. A woman may bring her own Get with her, but she
must declare at the same time, <span id="fr_1001"></span>[12](#fn_996.md)
"It was written and signed in my presence."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_985"></span>[282:1](etm136.htm#fr_990.md) That is, signed by
one witness only.

<span id="fn_986"></span>[282:2](etm136.htm#fr_991.md) That is, if he was
present only during the writing of the last part of the Get.

<span id="fn_987"></span>[282:3](etm136.htm#fr_992.md) That is, written and
signed on one and the same day.

<span id="fn_988"></span>[282:4](etm136.htm#fr_993.md) That is, during one
and the same night.

<span id="fn_989"></span>[283:5](etm136.htm#fr_994.md) Because a night and
the following day make together a legal day.

<span id="fn_990"></span>[283:6](etm136.htm#fr_995.md) Because it was
ante-dated, as the night belonged to the following day, and not to that
to which the date of the Get referred.

<span id="fn_991"></span>[283:7](etm136.htm#fr_996.md) Original ‏סם‎, which
some explain to be a kind of earth found in the Isle of Samos, hence its
name in Hebrew.

<span id="fn_992"></span>[283:8](etm136.htm#fr_997.md) Because it is
necessary that he should be able to attest and say, "I *saw* the Get
written and signed."

<span id="fn_993"></span>[284:9](etm136.htm#fr_998.md) Because he was not
subject to the Jewish law, and the rule is, that whatever a person is
not obliged to do himself he is not qualified to do for others.

<span id="fn_994"></span>[284:10](etm136.htm#fr_999.md) The commencement of
the act is, when the messenger received the Get from the husband, and
the end is, when he delivers it to the wife.

<span id="fn_995"></span>[284:11](etm136.htm#fr_1000.md) See Treatise
Yebamoth, chapters XV. and XVI.

<span id="fn_996"></span>[284:12](etm136.htm#fr_1001.md) Before the
tribunal, before whom she is to appear to submit the Get for
verification.
