*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. Should an entry be higher than twenty amoth, \[its height\] must be
lessened \[by lowering the cross-beam\]. R. Jehudah saith, "This is not
necessary; should it be wider than ten amoth \[its width\] must be
lessened; but if it has tine form \[appearance\] of a door \[gate\],
even though it be wider than ten amoth, it is not necessary to lessen
\[its width\]."

§ 2. To legalize \[the carrying or conveying within\] an entry \[to a
place inclosed on three sides\], Beth Shammai hold, "\[that\] a post and
a beam \[are required\];" but Beth Hillel hold, "\[that either\] post or
beam \[is sufficient\];" R. Eleazar saith, "two posts." On the authority
of R. Ishmael, a disciple stated before R. Akivah "Beth Shammai and Beth
Hillel did not differ \[in opinion\] as to an

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

entry less than four amoth wide, \[for they both agreed that\] such \[an
entry\] becomes legalized either through a beam or a post." On what did
they differ? \[Respecting\] entries upwards of four amoth wide, and up
to ten amoth: of these Beth Shammai hold, "that a post and a beam are
required;" while Beth Hillel hold, "\[that either\] post or beam \[is
sufficient\]." R. Akivah said, "They differ as to the one and as to the
other."

§ 3. The beam in question must be wide enough to receive an ‏אריח‎,
which is half of a brick, three hands in length and in width; it is,
however, sufficient that the beam be one hand wide, so as to hold a half
brick lengthwise.

§ 4. \[The beam must be\] wide enough to hold a half brick, \[and also\]
sound enough to bear one. R. Jehudah saith, "It must be wide \[enough\],
even though it be not sound \[enough\]."

§ 5. \[Should the beam\] be of straw or of reed, it is \[in law\]
regarded as if it were of metal; should it be crooked \[bent outwards\],
it is \[in law\] regarded as if it were straight; should it be
cylindrical, it is \[in law\] regarded as if it were square. Whatever
\[measures\] three hands in its circumference, holds one hand in
width. <span id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_182)

§ 6. The posts in question, must be ten hands high, be their breadth and
thickness whatever it may: R. José saith, "Their width must be three
hands."

§ 7. \[Such\] posts may be made out of any thing, even of that which is
possessed of life; \[this last, however,\] R. José prohibits. \[A living
animal tied on a grave to close it up\] communicates uncleanness \[even
after it be removed therefrom\]. R. Meir saith it is clean, "A letter of
divorce for a woman may also be written thereon <span
id="fr_183"></span>[2](#fn_183) \[a living animal\];" but R. José, the
Galilæan, pronounces it "\[the letter of divorce so written\] null,
\[not valid in law\]."

§ 8. Should a caravan encamp in a valley, and a fence be made around it
with the cattle's gear, it is lawful to move things within the fence
\[on the day of rest\]; provided always that the fence be ten hands
high, and the gaps \[open spaces\] therein, do not exceed \[in extent\]
the actual fencing. Every gap \[avenue\] which is about ten hands
\[wide\], is permitted; for it is considered as a door \[gate\], \[hut
gaps which are\] more than ten hands wide are prohibited.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

§ 9. \[The caravan may also be\] fenced round with three ropes, one
above the other; provided always there be between each rope less than
three hands \[interspace\], and that the measure \[width or thickness\]
of the three ropes \[together\] exceed one hand, so that the whole make
up \[the\] ten hands.

§ 10. The caravan may also be fenced round with cane-laths; provided
always the interspace between cane and cane be less than three hands.
\[All these regulations are limited to\] spoken of a caravan \[only\].
Such is the dictum of R. Jehudah; but the sages maintain, "\[that\] the
caravan is \[especially\] spoken of, solely \[in order to adduce an
instance\] from that which actually exists." <span
id="fr_184"></span>[3](#fn_184) Any partition which is not \[constructed
on the principle\] of warp and shoot is not a \[lawful\] partition. Such
is the dictum of R. José bar Jehudah; but the sages hold, "\[the
constructing it according to\] either one of the two \[principles is
sufficient\]." Four immunities have been granted \[to warriors\] in a
camp: they may bring wood from any place \[without respecting the rights
of ownership\]; they need not wash their hands before meals; they may
eat of ‏דמאי‎; <span id="fr_185"></span>[4](#fn_185) and they are
absolved from the obligation of erub. <span
id="fr_186"></span>[5](#fn_186)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_182"></span>[72:1](etm048.htm#fr_182) This computation is
but approximative. The exact proportion of the diameter to the
circumference, is as 100 to 314.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[72:2](etm048.htm#fr_183) Vide Treatise Gittin,
chap. II. § 3.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[73:3](etm048.htm#fr_184) Consequently, all
these rules and regulations apply to the single traveller; who also
enjoys the benefit thereof, should he encamp on the day of rest.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[73:4](etm048.htm#fr_185) Fruit or corn,
respecting which it is doubtful whether the legal dues
\[heave-offering\], tithes, &c., have been acquitted or not.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[73:5](etm048.htm#fr_186) Combining the
different tents which compose the camp.
