*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER V.

§ 1. Wherewith may \[a man let\] an animal go out? <span
id="fr_91"></span>[1a](#fn_91.md) and wherewith may \[he\] not \[let\] it
go out? The camel \[he\] may \[let\] go out with its halter, the she
camel with a nose-ring; the Lybian ass with bridle and bit; the horse
with its collar; all \[animals\] that wear a collar may go out
therewith, and be led thereby; \[in case it, the collar, becomes
unclean\] it must be rinsed, and dipped in its place \[without taking it
off.\]

§ 2. The ass goes out with its rug \[while it is tied on him\]. He-goats
may go out with a leather bandage round their privates; sheep with their
tails fastened up or down, and with wrapper; <span
id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_92.md) sire-goats

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

with their udders tied up. R. Jose prohibits all these, excepting the
sheep with wrapper. R. Jehudah saith, "She-goats may go out with their
udders tied up, if \[this be done\] to dry \[up the milk\], but not if
it be done to \[preserve the\] milk."

§ 3. Wherewith may \[a man\] not \[let\] animals go out? The camel must
not go out with a rag tied to its tail, <span
id="fr_93"></span>[3](#fn_93.md) nor with its legs strapped, <span
id="fr_94"></span>[4](#fn_94.md) nor with its fore and hind-legs fastened
together; <span id="fr_95"></span>[5](#fn_95.md) this \[applies\] to all
domestic animals. A man must not fasten camels together and lead them,
but he may hold the \[different\] ropes in his hand, only \[taking
care\] that they do not get twisted. <span id="fr_96"></span>[6](#fn_96.md)

§ 4. An ass must not go out with its rug that had not been fastened on
\[before the Sabbath\], nor with a bell, although it be muffled, nor
with a wooden frame-work round its neck, <span
id="fr_97"></span>[7](#fn_97.md) nor with a strap to its legs. Hens must
not go out with cords <span id="fr_98"></span>[8](#fn_98.md) tied on them,
nor with straps to their feet. Rams must not go out with go-carts to
their tails; <span id="fr_99"></span>[9](#fn_99.md) nor sheep with
sneezing-wood; <span id="fr_100"></span>[10](#fn_100.md) nor calves with a
reed-yoke; <span id="fr_101"></span>[11](#fn_101.md) nor a cow with the
skin of a hedgehog tied to her udders, <span
id="fr_102"></span>[12](#fn_102.md) nor with a strap between her horns. The
cow of R. Eleazar hen Azariah went out \[on the Sabbath\] with a strap
between her horns, which was against the consent of the sages.

that they are supported on small go-carts.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[44:10](etm027.htm#fr_100.md) ‏חנונות‎, according
to some, it is *veratrum* \[white hellebore\], which being put up the
nostrils of a sheep causes it to sneeze, and so to shake off the vermin;
according to others, it is an ointment applied to the newly-shorn sheep,
to protect them against the cold.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[44:11](etm027.htm#fr_101.md) A light yoke, put on

or reptiles from sucking them.
