### CHAPTER X.

§ 1. If a woman whose husband went beyond seas \[or on a distant
journey\], received intelligence of the death of her husband \[attested
by one witness only\], and upon that evidence married again; and it
happens, that after such a marriage, the husband \[who was supposed to
be dead\] returns: she must be separated from both husbands, <span
id="fr_715"></span>[1](#fn_710.md) and must receive *Get* of both. She
loses, with both, her rights to her marriage contract, maintenance,
repayment for the use of *usufructum* goods, and for the wear and tear
of such goods, and must restore whatever she received of either husband:
on that account the offspring of both marriages are deemed
bastards, <span id="fr_716"></span>[2](#fn_711.md) and neither \[husband\]
has a right to her findings or earnings, nor to annul her vows. If a
daughter of an Israelite, she is disqualified to marry a priest; if a
Levite's daughter, of the right of eating tithe; and if a priest's
daughter, of the right to eat heave; and the heirs of neither husband
can claim the amount of her marriage contract. <span
id="fr_717"></span>[3](#fn_712.md) In case of the death of these husbands
\[before they had divorced her\], the brother of one, as well as of the
other, must have the ceremony of *Chalitzah* performed to them by her,
but neither of them may marry her by *Yeboom*. R. José saith, "The
amount of her marriage contract must be charged on the property of her
first husband." R. Eleazar saith, "the first husband has a right to her
findings, her earnings, and to annul her vows;" R. Simeon says, "Carnal
intercourse with her, or the ceremony of *Chalitzah* by the brother of
her first [husband](errata.htm#1.md) releases her rival, and a child from
her first husband \[born at any time\] is legitimate; and if she married
the second time without requiring legal permission, <span
id="fr_718"></span>[4](#fn_713.md) she may return to the first husband."

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

§ 2. If married to the second husband with consent of the tribunal
\[Beth Din\], the marriage must be annulled \[on the return of the first
husband\], but she need not bring a sin-offering; she is bound to do so
\[and be divorced\] if she married without legal consent. <span
id="fr_719"></span>[5](#fn_714.md) The legal permission \[although
erroneous\] has the power, nevertheless of releasing from the obligation
of bringing a sin-offering. But if the Beth Din permitted her to marry,
and she married a person to whom she is prohibited to be married, <span
id="fr_720"></span>[6](#fn_715.md) she is bound to bring the sin-offering,
because the permission of the Beth Din was intended to apply to a legal
marriage only.

§ 3. If a woman whose husband and son are on a distant journey, is
told, <span id="fr_721"></span>[7](#fn_716.md) "Your husband died first,
and your son afterwards," <span id="fr_722"></span>[8](#fn_717.md) marries
again, and is then told the reverse, <span
id="fr_723"></span>[9](#fn_718.md) she must leave her \[second\] husband's
home, and any child from him born before or after this information was
received is a bastard. If they told her, "Thy son died first, and thy
husband afterwards," upon which she married her brother-in-law by
*Yeboom*, and it was afterwards found that the facts were the reverse,
she must leave her husband's house, <span
id="fr_724"></span>[10](#fn_719.md) and any child born before or after this
intelligence, is a bastard. If they told her, "Thy son died first, and
thy husband afterwards," upon which she married, and was afterwards
told, "He was alive then, but is dead now," she must separate from her
husband, and any child born before this latter information was received
is a bastard, but not those born afterwards. If they told her, "Thy
husband is dead," upon which she was betrothed to another man, and her
husband returns, she may go back to the latter; and even if the second
husband should have divorced her, such divorce would not disqualify her
to be married to a priest. For thus R. Eleazar ben Matya expounded the
text (Lev. xxi. 7), "Priests shall not marry a woman divorced from her
husband, that is, they may not marry a woman divorced from her
*husband*, consequently, they may marry her who was divorced from a man
who was not \[yet\] her husband."

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

§ 4. If a man is informed that his wife, who was in a distant country,
had died, upon which he married her sister, and the \[first\] wife comes
back, she may again return to him; he may marry the relations of the
second wife, <span id="fr_725"></span>[11](#fn_720.md) and she may marry
his: after the death of the first wife, he may again marry the second.
If, upon being informed of the death of his wife, he had married her
sister, and was then told, "She was alive at that time, but is dead
now," then any child born before the receipt of this intelligence is
illegitimate, but not those born afterwards. R. José established the
following rule: "Whenever a person causes another to incur the
prohibition of retaining his wife, he also causes that prohibition to
operate against himself in respect to his own wife; and wherever this
first mentioned is not incurred, the latter does also not take
place." <span id="fr_726"></span>[12](#fn_721.md)

§ 5. When a man, who had received information of his wife's death,
married her sister from father's side only, and upon the receipt of
intelligence of the death of this latter, marries her maternal
sister; <span id="fr_727"></span>[13](#fn_722.md) and on the news of the
decease of the last mentioned, marries her sister from father's
side; <span id="fr_728"></span>[14](#fn_723.md) and, finally, on the
reported death of this latter, marries her maternal sister, <span
id="fr_729"></span>[15](#fn_724.md) and it turns out that all these
\[five\] women are yet alive: then the first, third, and fifth wives are
permitted to him, and \[in case of *Yeboom*, such women\] also release
their rivals; but the second and fourth are prohibited to him, and the
intercourse with one of them \[by the brother-in-law, when the duty of
*Yeboom* is incumbent on him\], does not release her rivals; but if
his <span id="fr_730"></span>[16](#fn_725.md) intercourse with the second
wife had taken place after the death of the first, the second and fourth
are permitted to him, and release their rivals; but he may not have the
third and fifth in marriage, and intercourse with any one of them does
not release her rival.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[219:1](etm112.htm#fr_715.md) Because, having
married illegally, and upon insufficient evidence, she is to be treated
as an adulteress in every respect.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[219:2](etm112.htm#fr_716.md) In case she returns
to the first husband and has then children by him.

Ketuboth, chap. IV. § 10.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[220:5](etm112.htm#fr_719.md) Even on the evidence
of two witnesses.

from the obligation of *Yeboom*.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[220:9](etm112.htm#fr_723.md) That the son died
first, &c., which subjects her to the law of *Yeboom;* this information
being received of two witnesses who contradict the testimony of the
former.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[221:12](etm112.htm#fr_726.md) We have rendered
this passage according to the Commentaries of Maimonides and Bartenora.
The literal rendering of this obscure part is as follows: "Whosoever
disqualifies through others, also disqualifies for himself, but
whosoever does not disqualify for others, does not disqualify for
himself."

<span id="fn_722"></span>[221:13](etm112.htm#fr_727.md) Who is a stranger
to the first wife.

<span id="fn_723"></span>[221:14](etm112.htm#fr_728.md) Who is not related

<span id="fn_724"></span>[221:15](etm112.htm#fr_729.md) Who is not related
to the third, and, of course, not to the second and first wives.

husband of the five women.
