# XXIV. TREATISE KETUBOTH <span id="fr_783"></span>[1](#fn_778.md)

<span class="smallcaps">Contains</span> laws regulating marriage
contracts, dowries, and settlements, the matrimonial rights, duties and
obligations of husband and wife, and various other matters appertaining
to the married state.

The word ‏כתובה‎, in its primary signification, denotes a writing or
document generally; but its use is technically restricted to marriage
contracts, which are invariably drawn up according to a set form in the
Chaldee (Aramaic) language. The jointure settled on the wife by virtue
of the marriage contract is called her Ketubah, and in all cases amounts
to a fixed and standing sum which remains of the same amount whether the
parties are rich or poor, though by special covenant it may be enlarged.
The whole of a man's property is liable to the payment of the Ketubah,
and whatever portion of his real property he sells continues subject to
that liability should the remainder of his estate prove insufficient.
