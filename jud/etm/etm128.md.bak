------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER IX.

§ 1. He who in the Ketubah undertakes to his bride, <span
id="fr_897"></span>[1](#fn_892.md) "Right and title have I none to thy
property," does \[nevertheless\] enjoy the usufruct thereof during her
lifetime, and if she dies, he inherits from her. <span
id="fr_898"></span>[2](#fn_893.md) Such being the case, what \[then\] is
the effect of his undertaking to her, "Right and title have I none to
thy property?" That what she sells, or gives away, is valid. Had he
undertaken in writing, "Right and title have I none to thy property, nor
to the usufruct thereof;" he is not entitled to the usufruct during her
lifetime. R. Jehudah saith, "At all events he has the usufruct of the
proceeds

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

of her property, <span id="fr_899"></span>[3](#fn_894.md) unless he
undertakes to her, 'Right and title have I none to thy property, nor to
the fruits thereof, nor to the proceeds of these fruits \[henceforth
and\] for ever.' Had he undertaken to her, 'Right and title have I none
to thy property, nor to the fruits thereof \[or to the proceeds of these
fruits\] <span id="fr_900"></span>[4](#fn_895.md) during thy lifetime, nor
at thy death,' he does not enjoy the usufruct during leer life, and at
her decease he does not inherit of her." R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith,
"At her decease he does inherit of her, because he has contracted \[to
do that which is\] opposed to what is written in the law; and whosoever
contracts \[to do that which is\] opposed to what is written in the law,
his contract is null and void."

§ 2. Should a man dying leave a wife, creditors and heirs, and his
property, either as a trust or as a loan is in the hands of other
persons, R. Tarphon holds, "It must be given up to the weakest among
them." <span id="fr_901"></span>[5](#fn_896.md) But R. Akivah remarked, "No
commiseration \[must interfere with\] the administration of justice;
therefore it \[the property\] must be given up to the heirs, for all
others \[creditors\] must be sworn, <span
id="fr_902"></span>[6](#fn_897.md) whereas the heirs need not be
sworn." <span id="fr_903"></span>[7](#fn_898.md)

§ 3. If he <span id="fr_904"></span>[8](#fn_899.md) has left fruit reaped
\[gathered off the ground\], whichever \[of the parties concerned\]
first obtains possession thereof, is entitled thereto. Should the wife
have taken possession of more than \[the amount of\] her Ketubah, or the
creditor of more than \[the amount of\] his debt, the surplus must,
according to R. Tarphon, be given to the weakest among them; but R.
Akivah remarked, "No commiseration \[must interfere with\] the
administration of justice; therefore it \[the surplus\] must be given up
to the heirs, for all others need be sworn, but the heirs need not be
sworn."

§ 4. He who appoints his wife saleswoman \[in his shop\], or
administratrix \[manager of any part of his property\], may have her

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

sworn <span id="fr_905"></span>[9](#fn_900.md) whenever he pleases. R.
Eleazar saith, "\[He may do so under any circumstances\], even as to her
spindle or her dough."

§ 5. If he has undertaken to her, "Vow or oath will I not impose on
thee," he cannot have her sworn, but he may have her heirs sworn, and
those who act under her authority. \[If he has undertaken to her\] "Vow
or oath will I not impose on thee, nor on thy heirs, nor on those who
act under thy authority, <span id="fr_906"></span>[10](#fn_901.md) he
cannot have her sworn, not her, nor her heirs, nor those who act under
her authority? But his heirs can have her sworn, her, her heirs, and
those who act by her authority. \[If he has undertaken\] "Vow or oath
shall neither I, nor my heirs, nor those who act by my authority, impose
on thee, or on thy heirs, or on those who act by thy authority, <span
id="fr_907"></span>[11](#fn_902.md) neither he, nor his heirs, nor any that
act by his authority," can have her sworn, neither her, nor her heirs,
nor those who act under her authority.

§ 6. If she \[a widow circumstanced as in the preceding § stated\], goes
\[directly\] from her husband's grave to her father's house, or should
she return to the house of her father-in-law, but is not appointed
administratrix \[manager of her deceased husband's property\], his heirs
cannot have her sworn. But if she has been appointed administratrix, the
heirs may have her sworn as to the future, but they cannot have her
sworn as to the past. <span id="fr_908"></span>[12](#fn_903.md)

§ 7. She who prejudices her own Ketubah, <span
id="fr_909"></span>[13](#fn_904.md) cannot recover unless she be sworn.
Should one witness bear testimony that she has \[already\] been paid,
she cannot recover unless she be sworn. \[If she is to be paid\] out of
orphans’ property, or alienated property, or should he \[the husband\]
be absent, she cannot recover unless she be sworn.

§ 8. "Prejudice her Ketubah;" how \[can she do so\]? \[Suppose\] her
Ketubah was a thousand zooz; the husband asserts, "Thou hast received
\[the whole amount of\] thy Ketubah;" to which she replies, No, I have
only received a hundred zooz;" <span id="fr_910"></span>[14](#fn_905.md)
\[in that case\] she cannot recover \[the amount she claims\] unless she
be sworn. <span id="fr_911"></span>[15](#fn_906.md) "Should

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

one witness bear testimony that she has \[already\] been paid;" how \[is
this meant\]? \[Suppose\] her Ketubah was a thousand zooz; the husband
asserts, "Thou hast received \[the whole amount of\] thy Ketubah;" to
which she replies, "No, thou hast only paid me a hundred zooz." Should
one witness bear testimony against her, \[and affirm that\] she has
already been paid, she cannot recover \[the amount she claims\] unless
she be sworn. "Out of alienated property;" how \[is this to be
understood\]? Should he \[the husband\] have sold his property to
others, and she \[seeks to\] recover \[the amount of her Ketubah\] from
the purchasers, she cannot enforce payment unless she be sworn. <span
id="fr_912"></span>[16](#fn_907.md) "Out of orphans’ property;" how \[is
this meant\]? Should he \[the husband\] die, and leave his property to
his orphan children, and she \[seeks to\] recover \[the amount of her
Ketubah\] from the orphans, she cannot enforce payment unless she be
sworn. "If he \[the husband\] is absent;" how \[is this to be
understood\]? If he is gone beyond seas, and she \[seeks to\] recover
\[the amount of her Ketubah\] during his absence, she cannot enforce
payment unless she be sworn. R. Simeon saith, <span
id="fr_913"></span>[17](#fn_908.md) "Whenever she \[a widow\] claims \[the
amount of\] her Ketubah, the heirs of her husband can put her upon her
oath: but if she does not claim \[the amount of\] her Ketubah, the heirs
cannot put her upon her oath.

§ 9. If a woman produces her Get, <span id="fr_914"></span>[18](#fn_909.md)
but does not produce a \[[written](errata.htm#3.md)\] Ketubah, she is
\[nevertheless\] entitled to recover \[the standard amount of\] her
Ketubah. <span id="fr_915"></span>[19](#fn_910.md) Should she produce her
\[written\] Ketubah, but does not produce her Get, but says, "My Get is
lost," to which he \[the husband\] replies, "My receipt \[in discharge
of thy Ketubah\] is lost;" and likewise, in case a creditor produces his
bond, <span id="fr_916"></span>[20](#fn_911.md) but does not produce the
judicial pre-monition: <span id="fr_917"></span>[21](#fn_912.md) \[in
either of these cases\] they \[the wife or the creditor\] do not recover
\[the amount

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

they respectively claim\]. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "Ever since the
time of \[public\] danger began, a woman can recover \[the amount of\]
her Ketubah without producing the Get, and a creditor can recover \[the
amount of\] his bond without producing the judicial pre-monition.
\[Should she produce\] two Gittin and two Ketuboth, <span
id="fr_918"></span>[22](#fn_913.md) she is entitled to recover the amounts
of both Ketuboth. \[Should she produce\] two Ketuboth and one Get, or
two Gittin and one Ketubah, or one Ketubah, one Get, and \[proof of her
husband's subsequent\] decease, <span id="fr_919"></span>[23](#fn_914.md)
she can only recover the amount of one Ketubah; for he who divorces his
wife and takes [her](errata.htm#4.md) back, does only take her back under
the obligation of her first Ketubah. \[Of\] a minor, whom his father
gives in marriage, the Ketubah \[which he has signed\] continues valid,
as it is in virtue thereof that she continues his wife. Should a
proselyte embrace Judaism, together with his wife, her Ketubah remains
legally valid, as it is in virtue thereof that she continues his wife."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_892"></span>[264:1](etm128.htm#fr_897.md) The undertaking must
be entered into previous to marriage, and is valid, even though but
verbal.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[264:2](etm128.htm#fr_898.md) As the undertaking
is held to extend to the fee of the property only, but not to the
usufruct thereof. And after her death he inherits, because the words,
"thy property," lose their legal force at her decease, as the property
is then no longer hers.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[265:3](etm128.htm#fr_899.md) The amount of these
proceeds being vested in land, or otherwise disposed of, so as to become
a fresh source of income.

<span id="fn_895"></span>[265:4](etm128.htm#fr_900.md) These words are in
parenthesis in the text.

<span id="fn_896"></span>[265:5](etm128.htm#fr_901.md) Some commentators
hold that this expression applies to the creditor whose bond bears the
latest date, and whose title is in law held to be the weakest, as he has
no claim on the property which his debtor has alienated prior to that
date. Others apply the expression to the wife.

<span id="fn_897"></span>[265:6](etm128.htm#fr_902.md) Before they can
establish their claim against orphans.

<span id="fn_898"></span>[265:7](etm128.htm#fr_903.md) But succeed to the
property as a matter of course. All these enactments arose from the
axiom, that moveable property is not liable for debt, which axiom,
however, had to be altered when Israelites ceased to be landholders.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[265:8](etm128.htm#fr_904.md) The deceased.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[266:9](etm128.htm#fr_905.md) That she has not
abused his confidence, and the trust reposed in her, and that she has
not applied his property to his detriment, or to her own advantage, or
that of others.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[266:10](etm128.htm#fr_906.md) In case she be
divorced.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[266:11](etm128.htm#fr_907.md) Should she be
divorced during his absence.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[266:12](etm128.htm#fr_908.md) She can only be
called to account for the period after her husband's decease.

<span id="fn_904"></span>[266:13](etm128.htm#fr_909.md) For an explication
of this phrase, vide next §.

<span id="fn_905"></span>[266:14](etm128.htm#fr_910.md) She does admit
payment of part, and in so doing she destroys the integrity of her
Ketubah.

<span id="fn_906"></span>[266:15](etm128.htm#fr_911.md) To the truth of her
statement.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[267:16](etm128.htm#fr_912.md) That her husband
has not paid her any part of her Ketubah, and that there is no other
property out of which she could be paid.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[267:17](etm128.htm#fr_913.md) With reference to
the rule laid down in § 4 of this chapter.

<span id="fn_909"></span>[267:18](etm128.htm#fr_914.md) Act or letter of
divorce. (Vide Treatise Gittin.)

<span id="fn_910"></span>[267:19](etm128.htm#fr_915.md) That is to say, if
the Get be not torn or cancelled, as this is invariably done by the
Bethdin at the time the Ketubah is paid. The fact of her not producing
her written Ketubah is immaterial, for the law enacts that every woman
shall have a Ketubah; it is, therefore, assumed that she has one, even
though it is not in her possession.

<span id="fn_911"></span>[267:20](etm128.htm#fr_916.md) After the
Sabbatical year, which acquits all debts.

<span id="fn_912"></span>[267:21](etm128.htm#fr_917.md) Which alone
preserves his right. (Vide Treatise Shebiith, chap. X., § 4, and Moed
Katan, chap. Ill. § 3, note.)

<span id="fn_913"></span>[268:22](etm128.htm#fr_918.md) One Ketubah being
dated previous to the first Get, and the second Ketubah previous to the
second Get.

<span id="fn_914"></span>[268:23](etm128.htm#fr_919.md) In case her husband
received her again as his wife after the divorce, and she now claims a
double amount, one under the Get and one as a widow.
