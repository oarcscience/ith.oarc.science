*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER IV.

§ 1. The Meguillah may be read either sitting or standing, by one person
only, or by two persons at the same time, they alike fulfil their
obligation. In places where it is usual to say a blessing \[after
reading it\], it is obligatory to say it, but not where it is not
customary. Three men are called \[to read in the Holy Law\] on Mondays
and Thursdays; and in the afternoon of the Sabbath, neither more nor
less than that number may be called, nor shall any section from the
Prophets then be read. <span id="fr_601"></span>[1](#fn_598.md) He who
commences the reading of the Holy Law, shall say the \[first\] blessing
before reading it, and he who concludes the reading, shall say the last
blessing to be said after reading it. <span
id="fr_602"></span>[2](#fn_599.md)

§ 2. On the feast of new moon, on the middle-days of the festivals, four
men are to be called; this number may neither be added to, nor
diminished, nor shall any section in the Prophets then be read. The
first of these \[men\] shall say the \[first\] blessing before reading,
and the last, who concludes the reading, shall say the last blessing
after reading. This is the rule: on all days when an additional offering
is prescribed, and which are not festivals, four men are to be called;
five on festivals; six on the day of atonement; and seven on the
Sabbath; this number may not be diminished, but it may be increased, and
a section from the Prophets must be read on those days. The first of
those who then read in the Holy Law, shall say the blessing before
reading, and he who concludes the reading, shall say the last blessing
after reading.

§ 3. When ten men are not present in the synagogue, the Shemang may not
be repeated, <span id="fr_603"></span>[3](#fn_600.md) nor may any one then
go before the

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

reading-desk \[to act as minister\], nor may priests raise \[then\]
their hands \[to say the priest's blessing\], nor may they \[then\] read
in the law, nor read a section from the Prophets; and when there are not
ten persons present at a burial, the customary sittings, and stoppages
with the corpse <span id="fr_604"></span>[4](#fn_601.md) may not take
place, nor may the blessing for mourners be said, nor the forms used as
condolence to mourners, <span id="fr_605"></span>[5](#fn_602.md) nor the
seven blessings said on the celebration of a marriage, neither may the
persons who join to say the grace after meals mention the Divine
name. <span id="fr_606"></span>[6](#fn_603.md) And on an occasion of
redeeming land that has been consecrated, it is necessary that at least
nine Israelites and a Cohen \[priest\] shall be present, and the same
also at the valuation of a man. <span id="fr_607"></span>[7](#fn_604.md)

§ 4. Not less than three verses of the Holy Law may be read in the
synagogue to each person \[called to read\]. One verse only of the law
may at one time be read to the *meturgeman*, or interpreter, <span
id="fr_608"></span>[8](#fn_605.md) but it is lawful to read three
consecutive verses to him from the Prophets, <span
id="fr_609"></span>[9](#fn_606.md) but if each verse should form a separate
section, one verse only may be read to the *meturgeman* at a time.
Passages may be

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

skipped over \[‏מדלגין‎\] in the reading of the Prophets, but not in
that of the Holy Law. What time may be suffered to elapse to skip from
one passage to another? While the *meturgeman* does not conclude his
interpretation. <span id="fr_610"></span>[10](#fn_607.md)

§ 5. Whoever is accustomed to say in the public \[synagogue\] the
section from the Prophets, in \[the\] public \[synagogue\] shall also
there publicly recite the Shemang, <span
id="fr_611"></span>[11](#fn_608.md) and act as minister before the tebah
\[reading-desk\], and \[if a cohen\] shall say the blessing of the
priests; if a minor, his father, or teacher, shall act for him.

§ 6. A minor may read in the law \[in the synagogue\], and act as
*meturgeman*, but may not publicly recite the Shemang, nor act as
minister at the tebah, nor \[if a priest\] say \[by himself\] the
blessing of priests. A ‏פוחח‎ \[that is, one whose clothes are torn, so
that his arms and legs appear, or, as others explain it, one whose legs
and arms are quite bare,\] may repeat the Shemang, and act as
*meturgeman*, but he may not read in the Holy Law, nor act as minister
before the tebah, nor \[if a priest\] say the blessing of priests; a
blind person may repeat the Shemang, <span
id="fr_612"></span>[12](#fn_609.md) and act as *meturgeman;* but R. Jehudah
says, "One who never beheld the light \[that is, was born blind\], may
not repeat the Shemang."

§ 7. A priest whose hands are deformed, may not raise them \[to bless
the people\]. R. Jehudah also prohibits it to a priest whose hands are
stained with woad or with madder roots, because the people stare at him.
A person who should say, "I will not minister at the tebah in coloured
clothes," may not be permitted to do so in white ones; if he refuses to
minister with sandals to his feet, he may not be permitted to minister
barefooted. <span id="fr_613"></span>[13](#fn_610.md) A person who makes
the tephilin round, <span id="fr_614"></span>[14](#fn_611.md) endangers
himself, <span id="fr_615"></span>[15](#fn_612.md) and has not properly
observed the commandment; a person who places them \[low down\] on his
forehead, or on the palm of his hand, acts in a heretical manner: if he
cover them with gold, he imitates the opponents of tradition.

§ 8. A person who, in his prayers to the Almighty, says, "The

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

good shall \[alone\] bless thee," acts in a heretical manner; <span
id="fr_616"></span>[16](#fn_613.md) if he says, "Even to birds’ nests were
thy mercies extended," or, "For thy goodness be thy name remembered," or
one who says twice, "Modim" \[in the Amidah\], he shall be silenced \[by
authority\]. Also, whoever explains the text (Lev. xviii. 21), ‏ומזרעך
לא תתן להעביר למולך‎) to mean, "Thou shalt not give thy seed to an
Aramite \[heathen\] woman," <span id="fr_617"></span>[17](#fn_614.md) and
those who explain figuratively the section in the law relating to the
prohibition of carnal intercourse between relatives (Lev. xviii), shall
be silenced, and publicly reprimanded. The occurrence of Reuben with
Billah is to be read without being interpreted; that of Tamar \[and
Amnon\] is to be read and interpreted. The \[first part of the\]
occurrence with the golden calf is to be read and interpreted; but the
second part \[commencing Exod. xxxiv. 21\] is to be read, without being
interpreted. The blessing of the priests, and the occurrence of David
and Amnon, are neither to be read nor interpreted; the description of
the Divine chariot (Ezek. i.), is not to be read as an Aphtorah
\[section from the Prophets\], but R. Jehudah permits it; R. Eleazar
says, neither (Ezek. xvi.), "Cause Jerusalem to know her abomination,"
&c.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_598"></span>[188:1](etm098.htm#fr_601.md) In order not to
detain the people too long in the synagogues.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[188:2](etm098.htm#fr_602.md) And those who are
called between, shall not say any blessing; this has, however, been
altered subsequently, on account of people who might have entered the
synagogue in the interval, and who had not heard the first blessing.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[188:3](etm098.htm#fr_603.md) The original
expression ‏אין פורסין את שמע‎, has given rise to various
interpretations. According to Rashi and Bartenora, it is derived from
‏פרס‎, splitting or division: i.e. the Mishna here contemplates the case
of ten persons having entered a synagogue after the congregation had
already said the Shemang, when one of them says Kadish and ‏ברכו‎, and
only one of the two blessings ordered to be read before the Shemang (see
Treatise Berachoth), thus splitting or cutting off one of these two
blessings.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[189:4](etm098.htm#fr_604.md) It was the custom,
in the time of the Talmud, to set down the corpse seven times on its way
to the grave, when the mourners sat down, and when either a funeral
oration \[‏הספד‎\] was pronounced, or compliments of condolence were
made; between each of these seven pauses, they used to say to them,
"Rise ye good people, rise," or, "Sit down good people, sit down."
(Rashi, Bartenora, and Rishbam, in chap. V. of Baba Kammah).

<span id="fn_602"></span>[189:5](etm098.htm#fr_605.md) On returning from
the grave, the persons present, excepting the mourners, used to place
themselves in rows, through which the mourners passed, to whom they
addressed some words of condolence; these rows might not consist of less
than ten persons.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[189:6](etm098.htm#fr_606.md) That is, to say
‏נברך אלהינו‎; this last word is added when ten men are present. See
Treatise Berachoth, chap. IX. § 7.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[189:7](etm098.htm#fr_607.md) That is, in case a
person had said, "I vow the value of my person to the sanctuary," he
must pay to it the amount he would bring if he were sold as a slave.

<span id="fn_605"></span>[189:8](etm098.htm#fr_608.md) It was customary
ever since the time of Ezra, that at the public readings of the law,
each verse was translated by a person called the *meturgeman*, or
interpreter, who translated each verse as it was read in Hebrew into the
vernacular \[which then was Chaldee\], in order that the people should
understand what was read. The Mishna here directs that only one verse
should be read to the *meturgeman* at a time, in order not to confuse
him, and cause him to make errors, as he was bound to translate the
Hebrew text *extempore*. (See more about this custom in Maimonides,
chap. XII. of Hilchoth Tephilah, vol. I. page 78, of the Amsterdam
edition.)

<span id="fn_606"></span>[189:9](etm098.htm#fr_609.md) This is Only if the
*meturgeman* desires it.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[190:10](etm098.htm#fr_610.md) This is rendered
according to the commentary of Maimonides; but this passage is variously
explained.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[190:11](etm098.htm#fr_611.md) See Note
[3](#fn_600), page [188](etm097.htm#page_188.md).

<span id="fn_609"></span>[190:12](etm098.htm#fr_612.md) It is prohibited to
look at the priests whilst saying the blessing ‏ברכת כהנים‎.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[190:13](etm098.htm#fr_613.md) Because it is
supposed that these persons are hypocrites or heretics.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[190:14](etm098.htm#fr_614.md) That is, that for
the head.

<span id="fn_612"></span>[190:15](etm098.htm#fr_615.md) By accidental
contact with any hard substance.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[191:16](etm098.htm#fr_616.md) Because the faith
of Israel is, that the prayers of both good and bad should be jointly
offered to God, even as it is prescribed in the composition of the
incense offered to God, to blend the ill-smelling galbanum with the
other odoriferous aromatics.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[191:17](etm098.htm#fr_617.md) So as to procreate
children for idolatrous worship.
