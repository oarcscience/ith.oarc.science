# XX. TREATISE TAANITH,

###### OR, OF THE FASTS.

### <span class="smallcaps">Introduction</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> Book treats of public fasts, and the
manner in which they are to be observed. These fasts are either
*occasional*, or annual and *permanent:* occasional fasts are those
instituted as means of public repentance, humiliation, and prayer, to
beseech the Almighty's protection and help in respect to some calamity
which then had happened, and which fasts, of course, cease with the
occasion for which they were ordered. The annual and permanent fasts are
those observed on the anniversaries of unhappy events, which, in former
periods of the history of the nation, had befallen them.

This Treatise is chiefly occupied with the first kind of fasts above
mentioned, particularly with those formerly kept in Palestine on account
of a continued drought, which in that, and in other countries having the
same climate, is one of the greatest calamities that can happen to the
inhabitants; the Mishna, therefore, opens with that subject.
