*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER XV.

§ 1. These \[are the kind of\] knots which render \[a man\] guilty: the
camel-drivers’ knot, and the \[sailors’\] boatmen's knot; <span
id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_149) and as he becomes guilty by tying
\[splicing\] them, so does he likewise become guilty by untying them. R.
Meir saith, "A knot which he can untie with one hand only, he does not
become guilty for \[untying\]."

§ 2. There are other knots, the tying or untying of which does not
render guilty, as the camel-drivers’ and \[sailors’\] boatmen's knots
\[do\]: a woman may tie the slit in her chemise, and her cap-ribbons,
and her stay-laces \[girdle\], and her shoe-strings, and her
sandal-laces; \[also\] skins of oil, and of wine, and pots of meat. R.
Eleazar ben Jacob saith, "They may tie a rope before a beast, to prevent
its going out." A pail may be tied \[to a well\] by a girdle, but not by
a rope. R. Jehudah laid down the rule, "Any knot which is not intended
to be lasting \[tied once for good and all\] does not cause \[any one\]
to become guilty.

§ 3. Clothes may be folded even four or five times; on the evening of
the Sabbath, the beds may be made for \[use on\] the Sabbath; but they
must not be made on the Sabbath, for \[to be used\] after the Sabbath is
out. R. Ishmael saith, "The clothes may be folded, and the beds made on
the day of atonement, for \[use on\] the Sabbath." <span
id="fr_150"></span>[2](#fn_150) And the fat of the Sabbath-sacrifices
may be offered on the day of atonement: \[another version adds, "but not
that of the day of atonement on the Sabbath."\] R. Akivah saith, "That
of the Sabbath must not be offered on the day of atonement, nor that of
the day of atonement on the Sabbath."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_149"></span>[58:1](etm037.htm#fr_149) The first is the knot
which fastens the ring to the camel's snout; the second to fasten the
peak of a boat: both are intended to be durable.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[58:2](etm037.htm#fr_150) If the Sabbath come
in as the day of atonement goes out.
