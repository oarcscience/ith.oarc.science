# LXI. TREATISE YADAIM

<span class="smallcaps">Contains</span> regulations for purifying the
hands from uncleanness. These regulations rest entirely on the authority
of tradition, or the oral law, as no commandment of the Pentateuch is
quoted or adduced in their support by the Mishna. In order to eat bread
baked of Cholin, <span id="fr_1293"></span>[1](#fn_1288.md) the hands must
undergo ablution up to the wrist; the quantity of water to be used for
this purpose must not be less than a quarter of a lug. <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[2](#fn_1289.md) In order to eat Teroomah <span
id="fr_1295"></span>[3](#fn_1290.md) of any kind, the hands, in addition to
this first ablution, must undergo another one: hence they are
respectively called the first and second ablution: the last named does
not absolutely require a quarter of a lug of water.

The third chapter of the Treatise points out certain objects that render
the hands \[legally\] unclean. The last chapter treats of various
subjects, and also mentions some objections advanced by the Sadducees,
and how the Tanaim \[sages of the Mishna\] met these objections.
