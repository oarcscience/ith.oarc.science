### CHAPTER II.

§ 1. He who has turned his olives, <span id="fr_633"></span>[1](#fn_630.md)
and \[then\] has a death <span id="fr_634"></span>[2](#fn_631.md) \[in his
family\], or \[otherwise\] is prevented \[from at once putting them to
press\], or has been disappointed by his labourers, may put the first
press-block on \[the olives\], and leaves it \[thereon\] until after the
Moed. Such is the dictum of R. Jehudah; but R. José saith, "He may put
\[the olives\] into the oil press, and finish pressing \[them\], and
bung up \[the casks into which the oil is poured\] in the usual manner."

§ 2. Thus, likewise, he whose wine \[has been pressed but still\] is in
the press-pit, should he \[then\] have a death in his family, or be
\[otherwise\] prevented, or have been disappointed by his labourers, he
may pour \[the wine into casks\], cooper, and bung them up in the usual
manner. Such is the dictum of R. José: but R. Jehudah saith, "He must
only cover \[the pit\] with boards, so that the wine may not grow sour."

§ 3. A man may house his fruit from \[dread of\] thieves, and take flax
out of the buck, that it be not spoiled, provided always he does not
intentionally defer doing it till the Moed: but should he have
intentionally deferred doing it till the Moed, then in all these cases
he forfeits \[the article in question\]. <span

§ 4. They must not purchase houses, slaves, or cattle, excepting for the
use of the festival, or for the use of the vendor, who otherwise might
have nothing to eat. They must not clear away \[remove things\] from one
house to another, though this may be done if both houses are in the same
court. Things \[which have been put into the hands of a craftsman to be
made up or repaired\] must not be brought home from the workshop, <span
id="fr_636"></span>[4](#fn_633.md) but if he \[the owner\] suspects \[that
the things, if left with the workman, may be lost, or that he may exact
a second payment\] he may remove them to another court.

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

§ 5. They may cover dried figs with straw. R. Jehudah saith, "\[They
may\] likewise \[be put\] in layers."

§ 6. Dealers in fruit, in garments, or in utensils, may privately sell
what is required for use on the Moed. Huntsmen \[fishers\], and
manufacturers of peeled barley and grits, may carry on their occupations
in private, as the exigencies of the festival may require. R. José said,
"They have of their own accord adopted the more rigorous observance, and
do not carry on their occupation during the Moed."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_630"></span>[195:1](etm101.htm#fr_633.md) When they are in the
vat, in which case they must at once he pressed, or they rot.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[195:2](etm101.htm#fr_634.md) On account of which,
he must keep the seven days mourning, and abstain from work. Should this
period expire during the Moed, or should the labourers have disappointed
him, longer delay might become fatal to the olives.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[195:3](etm101.htm#fr_635.md) Some explain this to
mean, that he must leave the articles to be spoiled, others, that he
forfeits them, the Beth Din causing them to be distributed.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[195:4](etm101.htm#fr_636.md) Lest the owner be
accused of having placed the things with the workman, and the latter of
having been at work on them during the festival. The rule, however, only
applies to such articles as are not wanted for use on the Moed.
