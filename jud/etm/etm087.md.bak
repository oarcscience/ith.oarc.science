### CHAPTER III.

§ 1. If the Beth Din and all Israel saw the new moon, <span
id="fr_492"></span>[1](#fn_490.md) or if the examination of the witnesses
had already taken place, but it had become dark before the word
"Mekoodash," <span id="fr_493"></span>[2](#fn_491.md) was pronounced, the
month will be intercalary. When the Beth Din alone saw it, <span
id="fr_494"></span>[3](#fn_492.md) two of its members must stand up before
the others as witnesses, <span id="fr_495"></span>[4](#fn_493.md) who shall
then say, "Mekoodash, Mekoodash." When only three forming a Beth Din
have seen it, two of them must stand up as witnesses, and conjoin some
of their learned associates with the single one, <span
id="fr_496"></span>[5](#fn_494.md) and then give their evidence before
these, who are to say, "Mekoodash, Mekoodash," because a single member
of a Beth Din has not this faculty by himself alone.

§ 2. Every kind of horn may be used \[as a shophar, or cornet\] on the
feast of new year, excepting that of a cow, because it is called ‏קרן‎
in Scripture. <span id="fr_497"></span>[6](#fn_495.md) Rabbi José remarked,
"Surely all shophars are called ‏קרן‎ in the text;" for such is the
expression in Joshua vi. 5, ‏במשוך בקרן היובל‎.

§ 3. The cornet used in the temple on the feast of the new year, was a
straight horn of a chamois, <span id="fr_498"></span>[7](#fn_496.md) the
mouth-piece of which was covered with gold, the two trumpets <span
id="fr_499"></span>[8](#fn_497.md) were stationed on each side, the sound
of the cornet was prolonged after that of the trumpets had ceased,
because the obligation of the day applies more particularly to the
sounding of the cornet.

§ 4. On the fast days, two crooked ram's-horns were used, whose
mouth-pieces were covered with silver, and the two trumpets were
stationed in the middle between them; the sound of the trumpets was
prolonged after that of the horns had ceased, because the obligation of
the day applies more particularly to the sounding of the trumpets.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

§ 5. The year of jubilee is like the feast of new year, in respect to
the sounding and the blessings. R. Jehudah says, "On the feast of new
year a ram's-horn was sounded, and on the year of jubilee the horn of a
chamois."

§ 6. It is unlawful to use a shophar which had been rent, and afterwards
joined again together; also one composed of several pieces joined
together. If a shophar had a hole which had been closed, if it hinders
the proper sound, it may not be used; but if it does not affect the
proper sound, it may be used.

§ 7. If any one should sound the shophar within a hole, a cistern, or in
a large vessel of clay \[or earthenware\]—if the person who listens to
the sounding should plainly hear the sounding of the shophar, he will
have acquitted himself of his obligation, <span
id="fr_500"></span>[9](#fn_498.md) but not when he only hears the
reverberation, or echo of that sound; and thus, if a person passes by
the synagogue, or living close to it, should hear the shophar \[on the
feast of new year\], or the reading of the book of Esther \[on Pureem\],
he will have acquitted himself of his obligation, provided he has paid
proper attention, but not otherwise; and although one person should hear
it as well as another, yet the difference \[on which all depends\] is,
that *this* person paid due attention, and the other did not.

§ 8. \[In this manner we find it stated in Scripture, that\] "When Moses
held up his hand, then Israel prevailed," &c. (Exod. xvii. 11.) Could
the hands of Moses animate the contest, or cause it to cease? But it was
thus: whilst Israel looked to heaven for aid, and subjected their will
to their heavenly Father, they prevailed, but when they ceased to do so,
they failed. A similar instance we find (Numbers xxi. 8), "Make thee a
fiery serpent, and set it on a pole, and every one that is bitten when
he looketh upon it shall live." Could this serpent kill or bring to
life? But it was thus: when the Israelites looked to heaven for aid, and
subjected their inclination to the will of their heavenly Father, they
were cured, but when they did not, they perished. A deaf and dumb, or a
foolish person, and a child, cannot relieve others from their obligation
by acting for them. This is the rule—all those who are not bound to the
performance of a religious duty, cannot release others from their
obligation.
