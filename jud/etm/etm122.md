### CHAPTER III.

§ 1. These are the ‏נערות‎ <span id="fr_808"></span>[1](#fn_803.md) who
have \[the right to recover\] a fine. He who is carnally connected with
a bastardess, or a Nethina, <span id="fr_809"></span>[2](#fn_804.md) or

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

with a Samaritan. He, likewise, who is so connected with a proselyte, a
captive and a bondwoman who have been ransomed, converted, or manumitted
at less than three years and one day \[old\]: \[moreover\] he who is
carnally connected with his own sister, or with his father's sister, or
with his mother's sister, or with his \[own\] wife's sister, or with his
brother's wife, or with his father's brother's wife, <span
id="fr_810"></span>[3](#fn_805.md) or with a Niddah: in all these cases he
is finable; for although that these \[the last named series\] are under
\[the denunciations of\] ‏כרת‎ \[excision\], they are not \[sentenced
to\] death by the Bethdin.

§ 2. The following are not subjected to fine:—He who is carnally
connected with a proselyte, a captive, and a bondwoman who have been
ransomed, converted, or manumitted at more than three years and one day
\[old\]. R. Jehudah saith, "A captive <span
id="fr_811"></span>[4](#fn_806.md) who has been ransomed is presumed to
retain her virgin purity, although she be nubile." He who is carnally
connected with his own daughter, or his daughter's daughter, or his
son's daughter, or with his wife's daughter, or her son's daughter, or
her daughter's daughter, is not subject to a fine, because his life is
forfeited, and he is put to death through \[sentence of\] the Bethdin;
and whosoever forfeits life is not subjected to a fine in money, for it
is said, "If no mischief follow, he shall be punished by fine." <span
id="fr_812"></span>[5](#fn_807.md)

§ 3. \[Of\] a damsel who has been betrothed and divorced, R. José the
Galilean saith, "She does not recover any fine;" but R. Akivah saith,
"She does recover a fine, and her fine \[belongs\] to herself."

§ 4. He who seduceth a damsel pays threefold damages, and he who
violateth \[her, pays\] four \[fold\]. The seducer pays \[for her\]
disgrace, deterioration \[in value\], and the fine: in addition to which
the ravisher pays for the \[bodily\] pain \[he has inflicted upon her\].
What is \[the difference\] between the \[punishment of the\] seducer and
\[that of\] the ravisher? The ravisher pays for the \[bodily\] pain; the
seducer does not pay for the \[bodily\] pain. The ravisher must pay at
once, the seducer if he refuses to marry her. The ravisher must drink
out of his polluted vessel, <span id="fr_813"></span>[6](#fn_808.md)
whereas the seducer may, if he likes, divorce her.

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

§ 5. How \[is it to be understood that\] "he must drink out of his
polluted vessel"? Even though she he lame, or though she be blind, or
though she be afflicted with boils \[leprosy, he must marry and cannot
divorce her\]. But if he discovers in her disgraceful conduct \[after
marriage\], <span id="fr_814"></span>[7](#fn_809.md) or she is not
qualified to enter into \[the congregation of\] Israel, he is not
permitted to keep her; for it is said, "Unto him she shall be a wife, a
wife qualified and fitting for him." <span
id="fr_815"></span>[8](#fn_810.md)

§ 6. \[Of\] an orphan, who had been betrothed and divorced, R. Eleazar
saith, The seducer is free \[from penalty\], but the ravisher is
guilty." <span id="fr_816"></span>[9](#fn_811.md)

§ 7. What \[amount of compensation\] is \[due for her\] disgrace? \[In\]
all \[cases\] it is \[computed\] according to \[the rank, station, and
means of\] him who inflicts the disgrace, ands\[her\] who sustains the
disgrace. \[To determine the\] deterioration \[in value\] she is
appraised, as if she were a bondwoman about to be sold; \[and thus it is
ascertained\] what was her value \[before the fact\], and what is her
value \[after it\]. The fine is equal to all men, for whatever is fixed
in the law applies alike to all men. <span
id="fr_817"></span>[10](#fn_812.md)

§ 8. Whenever there is \[a right of\] sale \[vested in the father\], no
fine \[can be inflicted\]; and whenever there is \[the right to
inflict\] a fine, no sale \[can be effected by the father\]. In an
infant there is \[the right of\] sale \[vested in the father\], but she
has no \[right to recover a\] fine. A damsel <span
id="fr_818"></span>[11](#fn_813.md) has a \[right to a\] fine, but \[the
father\] has no \[right of\] sale. \[In\] a nubile girl \[the father
has\] no \[right of\] sale, and she has no \[right to recover a\] fine.

§ 9. He who \[voluntarily\] declares, "I have seduced the daughter of
A.B.," must pay for the disgrace and deterioration, in consequence of
his own confession, but he pays no fine. He who \[voluntarily\]

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

declares, "I have stolen, slaughtered, and sold \[A.B.'s cattle\]," must
pay the value, in consequence of his own confession, but he is not held
to pay the double, the four fold, or the five fold compensation. <span
id="fr_819"></span>[12](#fn_814.md) \[He who says\], "Mine ox has killed
A.B., or A.B.'s ox," must pay in consequence of his own confession;
\[but should he say\], "Mine ox has killed A.B.'s bondman," he does not
pay in consequence of his own confession. <span
id="fr_820"></span>[13](#fn_815.md) The rule is, in any case where the fine
to be inflicted exceeds the actual damage done, no one can be amerced in
consequence of his own confession.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_803"></span>[246:1](etm122.htm#fr_808.md) The ‏נערה‎ damsel
here spoken of, is from twelve years and one day old up to twelve and a
half years, beyond which age, or should she have no signs of puberty,
the fine cannot be exacted. (Vide Deut. xxii. 28, 29.)

<span id="fn_804"></span>[246:2](etm122.htm#fr_809.md) Vide Treatise
Yebamoth, Chap. II. § 4.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[247:3](etm122.htm#fr_810.md) If these two wives
have been divorced before the marriage was consummated.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[247:4](etm122.htm#fr_811.md) The captive spoken
of in the Mishna is an Israelite woman who has been kidnapped, or
carried off by heathens.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[247:5](etm122.htm#fr_812.md) Vide Exodus xxi. 22.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[247:6](etm122.htm#fr_813.md) A figurative
expression, denoting that he is bound to marry his victim, and can never
divorce her.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[248:7](etm122.htm#fr_814.md) Should she become
guilty of adultery.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[248:8](etm122.htm#fr_815.md) Vide Deut. xxii. 29.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[248:9](etm122.htm#fr_816.md) The difference
between the case here laid down and that of § 3 of this Chap. arises
from the fact, that there the fine and compensation goes to the girl's
father, whereas here it goes to herself. It is therefore assumed, that
in consenting to prostitute her person, she renounced her right to a
legal compensation, but she could never renounce her father's right.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[248:10](etm122.htm#fr_817.md) The amount of the
fine is fixed at fifty Shekels. (Deut. xxii. 29.)

<span id="fn_813"></span>[248:11](etm122.htm#fr_818.md) Until the age of
twelve years and one day the father has a right to sell his daughter.
The right to recover a fine in case of seduction or rape begins at that
age, and ends at twelve and a half years. Thenceforward a girl is
nubile, and is, according to Rabbinical definition, no longer entitled
to the designation ‏נערה‎, used in the Law, and to which the right of
recovering a fine is rigidly limited.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[249:12](etm122.htm#fr_819.md) Exodus xxii. 1–4.

<span id="fn_815"></span>[249:13](etm122.htm#fr_820.md) In all the former
instances he has only to make good the positive damage, but does not pay
any fine. But in the present instance the compensation is a positive
fine, as, without reference to the value of the bondman killed, the Law
fixes the compensation in all cases at thirty Shekels silver (Exod. xxi.
32).
