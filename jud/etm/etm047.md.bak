# XIII. TREATISE ERUBIN,

###### OR, THE COMBINATION OF PLACES AND OF LIMITS.

### <span class="smallcaps">Introduction</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> word ‏ערוב‎ \[erub\] signifies
commixture; and is used here to express the means through which the
extreme rigour of the Rabbinical enactment of ‏שבות‎ \[the
Sabbath-rest\] may in some degree be alleviated; inasmuch, as by these
means, places are combined together, which otherwise would be distinct
and separate, so that, without erub, it would be unlawful to carry any
thing from one of them to another. And the distance which \[without
erub\] it is unlawful to exceed, becomes enlarged: and thus, by this
commixture, or combination of places, an extension of immunities or
privileges is obtained.

The present Treatise contains regulations for the ‏ערובי חצרות‎, the
combining of courts; also for ‏ערוב תחומין‎, the combining of limits;
and for ‏ערוב מבוי‎, the combining of streets, also called ‏שתוף‎,
junction. <span id="fr_179"></span>[1](#fn_179.md) The combining of courts
treats of the rules and regulations by the observance of which the
various houses standing in one court, each of which houses forms a
distinct private reshuth, <span id="fr_180"></span>[2](#fn_180.md) are
combined into one general reshuth. This is done, through all the
householders in the court joining together in some article of food,
which they

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

deposit in a certain place; by doing which they are, in law, considered
to declare and proclaim the whole of the court, and all the dwellings
therein to be one general and common abode for all its inmates; who
thereby become entitled to carry and convey from one house to another,
within the limits of the court, on the day of rest.

The combining of limits treats of the rules and regulations, by the
observance of which the distance which may lawfully be traversed on the
day of rest becomes extended. According to the Mishna, no man is allowed
to go beyond 2000 paces from the bounds of his domicile on the day of
rest. He who intends to go further, must deposit food for two meals in
any particular place before the coming in of the day of rest; by doing
which, he is, in law, considered to declare that particular place as his
domicile, and he may then go 2000 paces beyond it.

The combining of streets, treats of the rules to be observed with
respect to narrow streets, which otherwise would be considered as a
private reshuth. And also with respect to public places, inclosed on
three sides, which otherwise would be considered as carmelith; <span
id="fr_181"></span>[3](#fn_181.md) but which, by means of a cross-beam, or
a wire, or a rope, are converted into a private reshuth.

In the practice of these rules the utmost nicety and strictness is
required, which it is the object of this Mishna to teach and to enforce.
