### CHAPTER V.

§ 1. Although they \[the sages\] decided that a virgin receives 200
dinar, and a widow a maneh, yet if he \[the husband\] likes to add even
100 maneh, he can add it. Should she \[the bride\] become widowed or
divorced, whether it occur subsequent to the betrothment or to the
espousals, she receives the whole \[amount settled upon her\]. R.
Eleazar ben Azariah saith, "If subsequent to the espousals she receives
the whole \[amount\], \[but if\] subsequent to the betrothment, a virgin
\[only\] receives 200 dinar, and a widow a maneh, as the settlement was
made solely on condition of the marriage taking place." R. Jehudah
saith, "If he \[the husband\] likes, he gives to a virgin a bond for 200
dinar, and she writes, 'I have received from thee 100 \[dinar\];' or to
a widow \[a bond for\] 100 dinar, and she writes 'I have received from
thee 50 zooz.'" But R. Meir said, "Whoever giveth to a virgin less than
200 dinar, or to a widow less than a maneh \[for their respective
Ketubah\], his intercourse \[with them\] is \[like\] fornication."

§ 2. They allow a virgin twelve months from \[the time\] the husband
proposed \[marriage\] to her, to provide herself \[with an outfit\]. And
even as they allow the woman \[twelve months time\], they also allow
\[it\] to the man to provide himself \[with an outfit\]. A widow is
allowed thirty days. Should the appointed time come, and they are not
married, she is \[to be\] maintained out of his \[property\], and \[if
he is a priest\] she may eat heave. R. Tarphon saith, "They may give her
all \[her maintenance in\] heave," but R. Akivah saith, "They are to
give her half \[her maintenance in\] Choolin, and half in heave."

§ 3. A Yabam <span id="fr_834"></span>[1](#fn_829.md) does not qualify
\[his sister-in-law, who expects to be married by him\] to eat of heave.
If \[out of the twelve preparatory months allowed her\] she has passed
six months \[during the lifetime\] of her \[intended\] husband, and six
months before the Yeboom, or even the whole twelve months before \[the
death of\] her \[intended\] husband, less one day before the Yeboom, or
the whole twelve months before the Yeboom, <span
id="fr_835"></span>[2](#fn_830.md) less one day before her \[intended\]
husband's \[death\], she is not \[entitled\] to eat of heave. Such was
the first \[eldest\] Mishna, but a subsequent Bethdin decided, in no
case is the woman \[entitled\] to eat of heave until she is placed under
the nuptial canopy.

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

§ 4. Should a man by vow consecrate \[the produce of\] his wife's
industry, she \[nevertheless has a right to\] subsist on her earnings.
\[If he consecrate\] the surplus, <span id="fr_836"></span>[3](#fn_831.md)
R. Meir saith, "It is consecrated:" R. Jochanan, the Sandaller, saith,
"It is Choolin \[non-consecrated\]." <span
id="fr_837"></span>[4](#fn_832.md)

§ 5. These are the \[kinds of\] work which the woman is bound to do for
her husband. She must grind corn, and bake, and wash, and cook, and
suckle her child, make his bed, and work in wool. If she brought him one
bondwoman \[or the value of one, for her dowry\], she needs not to
grind, bake, or wash: \[if she brought him\] two \[bondwomen, or the
value of two\], she need not cook nor suckle her child: \[if\] three,
she need not make his bed nor work in wool: \[if\] four, she may sit in
her easy chair. <span id="fr_838"></span>[5](#fn_833.md) R. Eleazar saith,
"Even though she has brought him \[her husband\] a hundred bondwomen, he
can compel her to work in wool, as idleness leads to unchastity." R.
Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "In like manner, should a man by vow <span
id="fr_839"></span>[6](#fn_834.md) interdict his wife from doing any kind
of work, he is bound to divorce her, and to pay \[the amount of\] her
Ketubah, because idleness may lead her to mental aberration."

§ 6. He who by vow interdicts his wife from connubial intercourse, Beth
Shammai hold \[after\] two weeks, Beth Hillel hold after \[one\] week
\[he must either be absolved from his vow by a person properly
qualified, or he must divorce her\]. Students may, for the purpose of
studying the law, be absent without the consent of their wives during
thirty days: workmen during one week. The marriage duty mentioned in the
Law, <span id="fr_840"></span>[7](#fn_835.md) is incumbent on men of
independence <span id="fr_841"></span>[8](#fn_836.md) daily, on workmen
twice a week, \[on\] ass drivers <span id="fr_842"></span>[9](#fn_837.md)
once a week, \[on\] camel drivers <span id="fr_843"></span>[10](#fn_838.md)
once in thirty days, \[on\] navigators <span
id="fr_844"></span>[11](#fn_839.md) once in six months. Such is the dictum
of R. Eleazar.

§ 7. A woman who is refractory against her husband <span
id="fr_845"></span>[12](#fn_840.md) has her Ketubah diminished by \[a
deduction of\] seven dinar every week.

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> R. Jehudah saith
"\[By\] seven terpaïkin." <span id="fr_846"></span>[13](#fn_841.md) How
long is the deduction to be continued? Until it reaches \[the full
amount of\] her Ketubah. R. José saith, "He \[the husband\] continues
the deductions \[so long as she remains refractory\], for should any
inheritance fall to her from any other quarter, he can therefrom recover
them." Thus likewise, should the husband prove refractory against his
wife, <span id="fr_847"></span>[14](#fn_842.md) they increase her Ketubah
by \[the addition of\] three dinar every week. R. Jehudah saith "\[By\]
three terpaïkin."

§ 8. He who provides his wife \[with her maintenance\] through a third
person, <span id="fr_848"></span>[15](#fn_843.md) must not allow her less
than two kab wheat or four kab barley \[a week\]. R. José stated that
this \[double\] allowance of barley was granted only through \[the
decision of\] R. Ishmael \[to those\] who resided near Idumea. <span
id="fr_849"></span>[16](#fn_844.md) He \[the husband\] must \[also\] allow
her half a kab of legumes, half a lug of oil, a kab of dried figs, or a
maneh weight of fig-cake: and if he has none, he must allow her fruits
of another kind in its stead. \[Further\] he must provide her with a
bedstead, a pillow, and a mattress \[another version has: "if he has no
pillow he must provide her with a mattress"\], \[Moreover\] he must give
her a bonnet \[cap\] for her head, a girdle for her loins, shoes every
festival, and wearing apparel to the value of fifty zooz every year. He
must not give her new garments in the summer season nor worn-out ones in
the rainy season; but he must give her garments to the value of fifty
zooz in the rainy season, so that she wears the old ones in the hot
weather, and the worn-out ones belong to her.

§ 9. He must further allow her a meah in money for her petty expences,
and she takes her meals with him every Sabbath evening. Should he not
allow her a meah in money for her petty expences, her earnings belong to
her. <span id="fr_850"></span>[17](#fn_845.md) What quantity of work is she
bound to do for him? Five selah weight \[of spun wool\] for warp <span
id="fr_851"></span>[18](#fn_846.md) in Judea, which \[are equal to\] ten
selah in Galilee, or ten selah weight for shute <span
id="fr_852"></span>[19](#fn_847.md) in Judea, which are \[equal to\] twenty
selah in Galilee. If

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

she is suckling, the quantity of her labor is \[to be\] diminished, and
that of her sustenance increased. To whom do \[all\] the \[above\]
stipulations apply? To the poor in Israel, but with respect to persons
of distinction, every thing is regulated according to rank \[and station
in society\]. <span id="fr_853"></span>[20](#fn_848.md)
