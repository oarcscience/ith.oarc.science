*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER II.

§ 1. A man who is reading in the Torah \[the parasha ‏שמע‎\], when the
time comes for saying \[prayers\], if he devotes his heart \[attention\]
to the prayer, he has acquitted himself \[of the obligation to say the
‏שמע‎\]; but if not, he has not \[so\] acquitted himself. At the close
of the different sections, man salutes out of respect and responds \[to
a salutation\]: but in the middle of a section, he salutes from fear
\[only\] and responds. Such is the dictum of R. Meir. R. Jehudah saith,
"In the middle \[of a section\] he salutes from fear, and responds out
of respect. At the close \[of a section\] he salutes out of respect, and
returns the salutation of any man." <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md)

2\. The \[close of the\] sections are, between the first benediction and
the second: between the second and ‏שמע ישראל‎ \[Hear O Israel\]:
between ‏שמע‎ and ‏והיה אם שמע‎ \[and it shall come to pass, &c\]: <span
id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10.md) between ‏יהוה אם שמע‎ and ‏ויאמר‎ <span
id="fr_11"></span>[3](#fn_11.md) \[and the Lord spake unto Moses\]: between
‏ויאמר‎ and ‏אמת ויציב‎, \[it is true and confirmed\]. R. Jehudah saith,
"Between ‏ויאמר‎ and ‏אמת ויציב‎, man is not to break off." R. Joshua
ben Korha saith, "Why does the ‏שמע‎ precede \[the section\] ‏והיה אם
שמע‎? In order that man may yield homage to the kingdom of heaven,
before he takes upon himself the yoke of the commandments. Why does
\[the section\] ‏יהוה אם שמע‎ precede ‏ויאמר‎? because \[the precepts
of\] ‏והיה אם שמע‎, may be practised by day and by night, <span
id="fr_12"></span>[4](#fn_12.md) whereas the precepts of ‏ויאמר‎ can only
be practised by day." <span id="fr_13"></span>[5](#fn_13.md)

§ 3. He who says the ‏שמע‎, so as not to be audible to his own ears, has
acquitted himself \[of the duty to say it\]. R. José saith,

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "He has not \[so\]
acquitted himself; if he has said it without due attention to the
letters \[spelling and pronunciation\]." R. José saith he has acquitted
himself. R. Jehudah saith he has not. If he has said it in an irregular
order, he has not acquitted himself. If he has made a mistake, he
recommences from where he made the mistake.

§ 4. Labourers may say the ‏שמע‎ on the top of a tree or of a wall;
which they are not at liberty to do with the ‏תפלה‎ \[the 18
benedictions called ‏עמירה‎\].

§ 5. A bridegroom is exempt \[from saying the ‏שמע‎\] on the first night
\[of his nuptials\] and until the expiration of the Sabbath, if he has
not consummated his marriage. It happened that Rabbon Gamaliel said
\[the ‏שמע‎\] on the first night of his nuptials. His disciples said to
him, "Hast thou not taught us, Rabbi, that a bridegroom is exempt \[from
saying the ‏שמע‎\] on the first night of his nuptials?" He answered
them, "I will not listen to you, to withhold my homage from the kingdom
of heaven even for the space of a single instant."

§ 6. He \[R. Gamaliel\] bathed on the first night of his wife's death.
His disciples said to him, "Hast thou not taught us, Rabbi, that a
mourner is prohibited to bathe on the first night?" He answered them, "I
am not like all other men; I am infirm."

§ 7. When his slave Tabbi died, he, \[R. Gamaliel\], received visits of
condolence. His disciples said to him, "Hast thou not taught us, Rabbi,
that visits of condolence are not to be received for slaves?" He
answered them, "My slave Tabbi was not like all other slaves; he was
‏כשר‎ \[pious\]."

§ 8. A bridegroom who wishes to recite the ‏שמע‎, on the first
\[bridal\] night, is at liberty so to do. Rabbon Simeon ben Gamaliel
saith, "Not every one who wishes to assume \[the\] fame \[of superior
piety\] may do so."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9"></span>[3:1](etm003.htm#fr_9.md) As, in those days, the
salutation, "Peace be with ye," conveyed the assurance of friendly
intentions, and of personal safety; to omit saluting, or to neglect
responding to a salutation, might be attended with dangerous
consequences.

teach them to your children." (Deut. xi. 18.)

<span id="fn_13"></span>[3:5](etm003.htm#fr_13.md) It directs, "That ye may
look upon it" \[the fringe\]. (Num. xvi. 39.)
