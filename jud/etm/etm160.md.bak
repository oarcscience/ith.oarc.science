### CHAPTER X.

§ 1. The law concerning the \[right\] shoulder, the two cheeks, and maw,
due as oblation to the priest, is obligatory in and out of the Holy
Land, during and after the existence of the Temple, <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[1](#fn_1275.md) and applies to animals for ordinary
use \[‏חולין‎\], but not to those used as consecrated sacrifices. For it
might have been concluded \[thus\], If in respect to animals slaughtered
for ‏חולין‎, to which the precept of giving the breast and foreleg \[to
the priest\] does not apply, it is nevertheless obligatory to give the
above mentioned oblations: it would follow, *a fortiori*, that these
oblations ought also to be given in respect to consecrated sacrifices
which *are* subject to the gift of the breast and foreleg; but it is
written \[Lev. vii. 34\], "\[For the wave-breast, and fore-leg, &c.\]
and have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons by a statute for
ever." Hence we are taught, that the priest obtains only what is
specified in the text \[viz., the breast, &c.\].

§ 2. All animals, for sacrifice, which had contracted a permanent \[i.e.
incurable\] blemish before they were consecrated, and were ransomed, are
subject to the laws concerning first-born and \[the other sacerdotal\]
oblations, and may, like animals used for ‏חולין‎, be shorn and used for
labor. The young and milk they produce after they were ransomed are also
lawful for use, and no guilt is incurred if they were slaughtered
outside \[the temple\]. They do not render an animal substituted for
them a valid sacrifice, but they must be ransomed after their death.
First-born of animals, and those given as tithe, are excepted. If they
had been consecrated before they had contracted the blemish, or that a
transitory blemish preceded the consecration, and they had subsequently
contracted a permanent one, they are free, after they are ransomed, from
the laws relating to first-born and other oblations; but they may not,
like animals used for ‏חולין‎, be shorn nor used to labor with. The
young and milk they produce may not be used, even after they were
ransomed, and guilt is incurred by any person who slaughtered them
outside \[of the temple\]. They also render an animal substituted for
them a valid sacrifice, and must be buried when they die.

§ 3. If a blemished first-born animal was sold by a priest to an

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Israelite, and had
become mingled with a hundred other animals; if these were slaughtered
by a hundred persons, the firstborn which is among them releases them
all \[of the obligation of paying the sacerdotal dues\]. If they were
all slaughtered by one person, one only of these animals is free. A
person who slaughters for a priest, or for a non-Israelite, is not bound
to pay the oblations; if he had the animals in partnership with one of
these, he must mark them. <span id="fr_1281"></span>[2](#fn_1276.md) If a
priest sold an animal \[to an Israelite\], reserving the oblations, the
Israelite is not bound to give them. Should one \[Israelite\] say to
another, Sell me the entrails of \[this\] cow," and there is yet of the
oblations among it \[viz. the maw\], he \[the buyer\], must give it
himself to the priest, and \[the seller\] need not allow him any
deduction from the purchase-money on that account; but if the animal was
bought by weight, the buyer must pay the sacerdotal dues, and may deduct
it from the purchase-money.

§ 4. If a proselyte had a cow, which he slaughtered before he had
embraced Judaism, he is free from the payment of the oblations, but not
if the slaughtering took place after his conversion. In a doubtful
case <span id="fr_1282"></span>[3](#fn_1277.md) he is free, because the
*onus probandi* lies with him who sets up the claim. What are the limits
of the shoulder? <span id="fr_1283"></span>[4](#fn_1278.md) From the bent
of the knee until the hip-bone: this is also the case in respect to the
shoulder mentioned in the sacrifice of the Nazarite, as also in respect
to the hind-leg down to the hough \[in peace-offerings\]. The \[limits
of the\] leg are, according to R. Jehudah, from the hip-joint until that
of the thigh. The \[limits of the\] two cheeks are from their joints
till the top ring of the trachea.

<span id="fn_1275"></span>[350:1](etm160.htm#fr_1280.md) This commandment
is not at present considered obligatory out of the Holy Land.

<span id="fn_1276"></span>[351:2](etm160.htm#fr_1281.md) That every one may
distinctly perceive that the priest or non-Israelite have a share in the
animals.

<span id="fn_1277"></span>[351:3](etm160.htm#fr_1282.md) Namely, whether
the slaughtering had taken place previous to, or after the conversion.

<span id="fn_1278"></span>[351:4](etm160.htm#fr_1283.md) Namely, that of
the right side fore-quarter, which must be given to the priest.
