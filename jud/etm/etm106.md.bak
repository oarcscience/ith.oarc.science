### CHAPTER II.

§ 1. How is it to be understood that the widow of his brother, who had
not lived contemporary with him \[releases her rival\]? When of two
\[married\] brothers one dies \[without issue\] and another brother was
born after the decease of the first mentioned, and the second \[or
surviving\] brother marries by *Yeboom* his widowed sister-in-law, and
dies, then that sister-in-law is released, having been the wife of a
brother who had not been contemporary with the \[third, or youngest\]
brother. The wife \[widow\] of the second brother is also free, as the
rival of the first mentioned, but if the other brother had only promised
marriage to her and died, <span id="fr_668"></span>[1](#fn_665.md) then the
sister-in-law must perform the ceremony of *Chalitzah*, but her
brother-in-law may not marry her by *Yeboom*.

§ 2. When of two brothers one dies, and the survivor marries his widow
by *Yeboom*, and another \[third\] brother was afterwards born, and the
second brother dies, then the widow of the first brother is free, as
having been the wife of a brother who had not been contemporary \[with
the third, or youngest brother\], and the widow of the second is also
free, as the rival of the first mentioned. If he had only promised her
marriage and died, the second sister-in-law must perform the ceremony of
*Chalitzah*, but the brother-in-law may not marry her; but R. Simeon
says, "\[The third brother\] may marry by *Yeboom* \[in the two last
cases\], whichever he likes, or cause either to perform to him the
ceremony of *Chalitzah*."

§ 3. A rule obtains in respect to marriage by *Yeboom*. Every woman whom
it is unlawful to marry, by reason of being within the degrees of
relationship forbidden to intermarry, may not perform the ceremony of
*Chalitzah*, nor can be married by her brother-in-law by *Yeboom*, and
all women who cannot be so married, owing to other legal
prohibitions, <span id="fr_669"></span>[2](#fn_666.md) or on account of
holiness of station, must perform the ceremony of *Chalitzah*, but may
not be married to the brother-in-law by *Yeboom*. When of two sisters
\[who had been married to two brothers\] one only can be legally married
\[to a third, or surviving brother\], she is bound either to give
*Chalitzah*, or to marry that brother-in-law by *Yeboom*.

§ 4. By legal prohibitions \[to marry as above mentioned\] are meant the
secondary degrees of relationship prohibited by the Rabbins to

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

intermarry.—Prohibited to intermarry on account of holiness of station
are, a widow to a high priest; a woman who had been divorced, or
performed the ceremony of *Chalitzah*, who had \[unlawfully\] been
married to an ordinary priest; a person born in adultery, and a daughter
of the *Nethinin* <span id="fr_670"></span>[3](#fn_667.md) married to an
Israelite, or a daughter of Israel to a *Nethin*, or to one born in
adultery.

§ 5. In every case where there is a surviving brother, though of
illegitimate origin, the widow of the deceased brother of such a one
becomes subject to the law of *Yeboom*; he also possesses all the rights
of a brother, except when he is the son of a bondwoman, or of a strange
\[i.e. non-Israelite\] woman. In every case where there is a son, <span
id="fr_671"></span>[4](#fn_668.md) that son releases his father's wife from
the obligation of *Yeboom*, and even if illegitimate, is amenable to the
penalties of the law against striking or cursing his father; he
possesses, moreover, all the rights of a son, except he were the son of
a bond-woman, or of a strange \[i.e. non-Israelite\] woman.

§ 6. When a person has given ‏קדושין‎ \[i.e. betrothing\] to one of two
sisters, and does no longer know to which of them he gave it, he must
give ‏גט‎, i.e. a letter of divorce to each. If he left at his decease
one brother only, that brother must cause both \[sisters\] to perform
*Chalitzah* to him. If he left two brothers, one must have *Chalitzah*
performed to him, and the other may marry the sister-in-law by *Yeboom*,
but if these brothers had already married the sisters, in
anticipation, <span id="fr_672"></span>[5](#fn_669.md) they are not to be
separated from them.

§ 7. When two men \[who are strangers to each other\] have each of them
betrothed one of two sisters, and neither of these men know which sister
he has betrothed, then each man must give two *Gets* \[letters of
divorce\] to the sisters. If \[the men\] died, and each left a brother,
these brothers must have *Chalitzah* given to them by both sisters. If
one of the men <span id="fr_673"></span>[6](#fn_670.md) had one brother,
and the other two, in the case of one brother only, he must have the
*Chalitzah* performed by both sisters; and in that of the two brothers,
one must have *Chalitzah* performed to him, and the other brother may
marry his brother's widow by *Yeboom*, but if they had already married
the sisters in anticipation, <span id="fr_674"></span>[5](#fn_669.md) they
are not to be separated from them. If

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

each man left two brothers, one brother of each pair must have
*Chalitzah* performed to him by one of the sisters, and the other
brother of each pair can then marry by *Yeboom* one of the sisters
released by the *Chalitzah* performed to the other brother. If two
brothers had already in anticipation <span
id="fr_675"></span>[7](#fn_671.md) received *Chalitzah* from the sisters,
the latter are not to be separated from them.

§ 8. It is proper that the eldest brother should perform the duty of
*Yeboom*; yet, if it were done by a younger brother, the marriage is
valid. When suspected of carnal intercourse with a bond-woman, or with a
non-Israelite woman, he may not marry her, even after \[the first
mentioned\] had been manumitted, or \[the last mentioned\] had become a
proselyte, but if he did marry \[any of these women\], they shall not be
separated; but if a person should be suspected of having had adulterous
intercourse with a married woman, who, in consequence, had been
separated from her husband judicially, then, even if the said suspected
person had already married her, they must be separated.

§ 9. A person who brings to a married woman a *Get* from her husband,
from beyond sea, <span id="fr_676"></span>[8](#fn_672.md) and declares that
the said document was duly written and signed in his presence, <span
id="fr_677"></span>[9](#fn_673.md) may not marry that woman. If a person
should say to a married woman, "Thy husband is dead," or, "I have
murdered him," or, "We have murdered him," such person may not marry
that woman; R. Jehudah saith, "If he says, 'I have murdered him,' the
woman may not marry at all, <span id="fr_678"></span>[10](#fn_674.md) but
if he said, 'We have murdered him,' she may be married." <span
id="fr_679"></span>[11](#fn_675.md)

§ 10. A ‏חכם‎ \[i.e. one learned in the Holy Law\] who had declared
binding a vow made by a woman against her husband, <span
id="fr_680"></span>[12](#fn_676.md) may

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

not marry her; but he may do so in case that woman appeared before him
at the tribunal, and there expressed her refusal, or performed the
ceremony of *Chalitzah;* and in all the above-mentioned cases, if the
men were married at the time \[of the prohibition\], and their wives
died since, they may marry the women prohibited to them before; also, in
case these women had, meanwhile, been married to others, and were
divorced, or had become widows, the females also prohibited to these
men, may marry their sons or brothers.

consummated the marriage.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[203:2](etm106.htm#fr_669.md) This is explained in
the next section.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[204:3](etm106.htm#fr_670.md) *Nethinim* are the
descendants of the Gibeonites, who became proselytes in the time of
Joshua.

illegitimate.

decision of the tribunal, and without waiting for it.

mentioned in the first proposition.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[205:7](etm106.htm#fr_675.md) Of the judicial
decision of the tribunal, and without waiting for it.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[205:9](etm106.htm#fr_677.md) He is bound to make
such declaration. (Gittin, chap. I. § 1.)

<span id="fn_674"></span>[205:10](etm106.htm#fr_678.md) Neither to the
self-accusing murderer, nor to any other person; because the unsupported
evidence of a criminal is not admissible, particularly in this case;
when, perhaps, he may have charged himself with an imaginary crime, in
order to obtain the woman.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[205:11](etm106.htm#fr_679.md) To others, not the
self-accuser. There is, however, a contradiction in this latter part of
the Mishna; for whether such a person committed the crime alone, or in
conjunction with others, he is, doubtless, equally guilty; and,
therefore, why should his evidence be received in the latter case \[and
the woman allowed to marry\], and not in the former? It is, therefore,
explained to mean, that he said, "I was with those who murdered him, but
did not murder him myself."
