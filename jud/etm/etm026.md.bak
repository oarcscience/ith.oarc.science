### CHAPTER IV.

§ 1. Wherein may hot vessels \[saucepans\] be deposited \[to retain

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

the heat\]? And wherein may they not \[be\] deposit\[ed\]? They must not
\[be\] deposit\[ed\] in olive- kernels, in dung, in salt, in lime, or in
sand (whether wet or dry), nor yet in straw, nor in grape-husks, nor in
woolflocks, nor in herbs, while these are wet; but it is permitted to
deposit in them should they be dry. It is permitted to deposit \[the
vessels or saucepans\] under garments or under fruits \[any kind of
grain, &c.\], under pigeon-feathers, or shavings, or under fine flaxen
tow; R. Jehudah prohibits fine, but permits coarse \[flaxen tow\].

§ 2. They may \[be\] deposit\[ed, wrapped\] in skins, and removed
\[taken out of them again: likewise\] in shorn-wool, but must not be
removed \[taken out\] therefrom. How then is man to do? He takes off the
lid \[of the vessel or saucepan\] and the wool falls off. R. Eleazar ben
Azariah saith, "He inclines the vessel to one side, and takes out \[what
he requires\], lest \[were he to remove it\] he cannot put it back
again." <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md) But the sages hold \[that it
is permitted to\] take \[the vessel\] out, and \[to\] put \[it\] back
again. If man has not covered up \[his vessel or pot\] while yet day
\[before the Sabbath comes in\], he must not cover it after dusk; if he
have covered it, and it is become uncovered, he is permitted to cover it
again. He may fill a pitcher, and place it under a pillow or bolster
\[to take the chill off.\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_90"></span>[43:1](etm026.htm#fr_90.md) As the tow or wool
falling together, would fill up the cavity made by the saucepan; and it
is unlawful to make another.
