*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,

### CHAPTER II.

§ 1. With what \[species of wick\] may \[the lamps\] be lighted \[on the
Sabbath\]? and with what may \[they\] not be lighted? \[They\] may not
be lighted with the moss \[that grows upon\] cedars, nor with undressed
flax, nor with floss-silk, <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76) nor with
a wick made of osier, nor with thread \[made of a kind of grass
growing\] in the

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

wilderness, nor with the weeds \[growing\] upon the water; <span
id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_77) \[they may not be lighted\] with pitch,
nor with wax, nor with oil of ‏קיק‎, <span id="fr_78"></span>[3](#fn_78)
nor with \[consecrated\] oil \[profaned and set apart\] for burning, nor
with \[the fat from\] the tails \[of sheep\], nor with tallow. Nahum,
the Mede, opines that \[they\] may be lighted with boiled \[or
clarified\] tallow; but the sages hold, that whether it be boiled or not
boiled it may not be used to light therewith.

§ 2. \[They\] may not be lighted \[even\] on festivals with oil \[set
apart\] to be burnt. R. Ishmael saith, that for the honour of the
Sabbath \[they\] may not be lighted with the dregs of pitch; but the
sages allow all \[sorts of\] oils: with oil of nuts, with oil of radish
\[seed\], with oil of fish, with oil of gourd seed, with oil. of the
dregs of pitch, and with naphtha. R. Tarphon saith, they must not be
lighted but with oil of olives only.

§ 3. Nothing which grows from \[the wood of\] a tree is proper to light
with but flax; <span id="fr_79"></span>[4](#fn_79) and whatever grows
from \[the wood of\] a tree cannot be polluted by the pollution of a
tent <span id="fr_80"></span>[5](#fn_80) but flax. A slip of cloth which
has been folded but not singed, R. Eleazar saith it is unclean, and must
not \[be used to\] light with; \[but\] R. Akivah opines \[that\] it is
clean, and \[may be used to\] light with.

§ 4. A person may not perforate an eggshell, and fill it with oil, and
place it over the lamp, that it may drop \[therein\], and although it be
of earthenware \[it is not permitted\]; but R. Jehudah allows it. But if
the potter had originally thus joined it, it is allowable, because it is
then but one vessel. A person may not fill a dish \[with\] oil and place
it beside the lamp, and put the end of the wick into it, so that it may
attract \[the oil\]; but R. Jehudah permits it.

§ 5. He who extinguishes the lamp because he is afraid of
heathens, <span id="fr_81"></span>[6](#fn_81) of robbers, of an evil
spirit, <span id="fr_82"></span>[7](#fn_82) or that the sick may sleep,
is absolved; but \[if his intention is\] to save his lamp, oil, or wick,
he

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

is guilty; R. José allows it in either case except the wick, because he
thereby forms a coal.

§ 6. For three transgressions women die in childbirth: because they are
not careful of their separation at proper periods, <span
id="fr_83"></span>[8](#fn_83) of separating the first cake of the
dough, <span id="fr_84"></span>[9](#fn_84) and of lighting the lamp
\[for the Sabbath\].

§ 7. A man is obliged to inquire concerning three things in his house on
the eve of the Sabbath, near the dusk of the evening:—Have ye separated
the tithe? Have ye prepared the Sabbatical mixture \[erub\]? Light the
lamps.

§ 8. If it is doubtful whether it be dark or not, <span
id="fr_85"></span>[10](#fn_85) the certainly untithed \[grain or fruit\]
are not to be tithed; neither must the vessels be immersed, nor the
lamps lighted; but it is permitted to tithe that which is doubtful,
prepare the Sabbatical mixture, and cover \[the pots of victuals to
retain their heat.\]
