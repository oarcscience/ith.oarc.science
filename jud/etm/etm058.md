under our jurisdiction or control; it defines what constitutes leaven,
and how to banish or annul it before or during the festival; what bitter
herbs were to be eaten with the paschal sacrifice; laws relative to the
proper observance of the festival, the middle days thereof, and of the
14th of Nissan; also, respecting the observance of the Second Passover,
by those who could not observe it at its proper time (Num. ix.), and
other laws incidentally mentioned, or directly relating to the subject.
