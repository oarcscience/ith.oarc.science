*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER XXII.

§ 1. Should a cask break, sufficient may be saved to serve three meals.
The owner may also call to others, "Come and save for yourselves
\[whatever you can\];" provided, always, \[that\] no portion of the
leakage be \[sponged\] up \[soaked up with a sponge\]. Men must not
squeeze fruits, so as to extract the juice; and if it ooze out by
itself, it is forbidden \[to use it\]. R. Jehudah saith, "If the fruits
are for eating, the juice which oozes out is permitted \[for use\], but
if the fruits are for beverage, the juice which oozes out is forbidden
\[for use\]. If honey-cakes have been broken on the Sabbath-eve, and the
honey oozes out, it is forbidden \[for use\]; but R. Eleazar permits
\[its use\].

§ 2. Whatever has been dressed with hot water on the Sabbath-eve may be
soaked in hot water on the Sabbath; and whatever has not been dressed
with hot water on the Sabbath-eve must only be passed through hot water
on the Sabbath; except stale salt fish, \[small salted fishes\], and
Spanish ‏קוליס‎; <span id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_170.md) as the passing
these through hot water is their proper dressing \[all the cooking they
require\].

§ 3. A man may break open a cask, to eat dry figs out of it; provided
always, he does it not with the intention to prepare the cask for
subsequent use. He must not pierce the bung-hole of a cask; such is the
dictum of R. Jehudah; but the sages permit it. \[According to another
version, R. José permits it\]. He must not spile a cask \[bore a hole in
the side thereof\]: and, if it is spiled, he must not put wax on it,
because he \[thereby\] smoothens it down. R. Jehudah said, "Such a case
was once brought before R. Jochanan, ben Sachai, at Arob, when he
remarked, 'I doubt whether I ought not to have inflicted a sin-offering
on the accused.'"

§ 4. They may put cooked victuals into a cave \[cellar\] to save them;
also put good water \[in a vessel\] into water that is not drinkable, to
keep it \[the former\] cool: likewise cold water \[in a vessel\], into
hot water, to warm \[the former\]. He whose clothes have dropped into
the water while on the road, may unhesitatingly go on with them. As soon
as he arrives at the outmost court \[of the town or village\] he may
spread his clothes in the sun, but not before the people \[publicly\].

§ 5. Whoever bathes in the water of a cavern, or in the hot wells of
Tiberias, though he wipe himself with ten napkins, he must not bring
them away in his hand; but ten persons wiping themselves with one
napkin, their faces, their hands, and their feet, may bring it away in
their hands.

§ 6. They may anoint and rub the stomach with the hands, but not so as
to get fatigued. They must not brush the body with a flesh brush, or
descend into a ‏קורדימה‎; <span id="fr_171"></span>[2](#fn_171.md) they
must not take an emetic, or stretch the limbs of an infant, or put back
a rupture; he who has strained his hand or foot must not pour cold water
on it; but he may wash it in the usual way; and if he does get cured he
does get cured.
