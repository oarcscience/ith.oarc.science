*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. Dry land may be irrigated on the Moed, <span
id="fr_618"></span>[1](#fn_615.md) and also during the Sabbatical year, as
well from a fountain that is newly sprung forth, as from one that is not
newly sprung forth; but they must not irrigate it with rain-water, nor
with water \[drawn\] from a deep well; nor may they make \[dig\]
trenches \[to hold water\] round vines.

§ 2. R. Eleazar ben Azariah saith, "They must not make \[dig\] a fresh
trench \[conduit, or water course\] on the Moed, or during the
Sabbatical year." But the sages hold, that a fresh trench \[water
course\] may be dug during the Sabbatical year, and that those
\[conduits\] which are choked up, may be repaired on the Moed. They may
\[likewise\] repair water reservoirs \[which are\] in the public
reshuth, <span id="fr_619"></span>[2](#fn_616.md) and cleanse them: They
may also repair the roads \[streets\], the market \[public\] places, and
the spring-baths. In short, they may do whatever the exigencies of the
public \[service\] require. They

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

may mark \[whitewash\] tombs, <span id="fr_620"></span>[3](#fn_617.md) and
even send out \[inspectors\] of Kilaim. <span
id="fr_621"></span>[4](#fn_618.md)

§ 3. R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, "They may lead water from tree to tree,
provided always the whole orchard be not irrigated; plants which have
not imbibed <span id="fr_622"></span>[5](#fn_619.md) \[water\] before the
Moed, must not be irrigated during the Moed." <span
id="fr_623"></span>[6](#fn_620.md) But the sages permit the one and the
other.

§ 4. They may \[by means of gins and pit-falls\] catch moles and
field-mice in orchards and fields, but they must not \[do this\] in the
\[usual\] way, <span id="fr_624"></span>[7](#fn_621.md) both on the Moed
and during the Sabbatical year. But the sages hold that in an orchard
\[the vermin may he caught\] in the \[usual\] way, but that in a
corn-field \[it must\] not \[be caught\] in the \[usual\] way. During
the Moed they may pile \[loose stones to stop\] a gap <span
id="fr_625"></span>[8](#fn_622.md) \[in a fence\], but during the
Sabbatical year they repair it in the \[ordinary\] way.

§ 5. R. Meir saith, "Priests make the first inspection of the plague
\[of leprosy\] in order to relieve \[the patient\], but not to restrict
\[him\]." But the sages decide neither to relieve nor to restrict \[in
no case is such an inspection to be undertaken during the Moed\]. <span
id="fr_626"></span>[9](#fn_623.md) R. Meir \[further\] saith, "A man may
collect the bones of his father and mother \[during the Moed, to inter
them\], because it is a satisfaction to him \[relieves his mind\]." But
R. José saith, "It is a grief to him \[afflicts his mind\]. Man is not
to excite \[others to mourn\] over his dead, <span
id="fr_627"></span>[10](#fn_624.md) nor hold a funeral oration for thirty
days before the festival."

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

§ 6. They must not dig graves or burial vaults on the Moed, but they may
prepare \[enlarge\] graves \[previously dug\] on the Moed, and also make
a washing pit during the Moed, and a coffin in the same court where the
corpse lies. \[This, however,\] R. Jehudah prohibits, unless the boards
have been \[previously\] provided.

§ 7. They must not espouse wives on the Moed, neither virgins nor
widows; nor must they be ‏מיבם‎, <span id="fr_628"></span>[11](#fn_625.md)
as that \[the espousal\] is a cause of joy to him individually, <span
id="fr_629"></span>[12](#fn_626.md) but he may receive back his own
divorced wife. A woman may prepare her ornaments on the Moed. R. Jehudah
saith, "She must not apply lime \[chalk as a cosmetic\], because it
\[may\] disfigure her."

§ 8. An ordinary person \[who is not of the craft\] may sew \[make
stitches\] in the \[regular\] way; but the craftsman \[whose trade it is
to sew, must only do it\] zigzag \[during the Moed\]. They may twine
\[the ropes in the sacking of\] bedsteads. R. José saith, "\[They may\]
only tighten \[the ropes\]."

§ 9. They may erect an oven, or a hearth, or a mill, on the Moed \[for
the use of the festival\]. R. Jehudah saith, "New millstones must not be
chipped." <span id="fr_630"></span>[13](#fn_627.md)

§ 10. A railing \[balustrade\] may be made round a roof, or gallery
\[according to the\] workmanship of common men, but not \[according to
the\] workmanship of \[regular\] craftsmen. Rents \[in the roof\] may
also be closed, and \[then\] smoothened with a roller, <span
id="fr_631"></span>[14](#fn_628.md) or with hand and foot, but not with a
trowel. Should the hinges of the door-frame, or the beam, or the lock
\[of the door\], or the key \[thereto\], have been broken, they may be
repaired on the Moed, provided always he does not intentionally put off
the repairs till the Moed. All \[kinds of\] pickled food <span
id="fr_632"></span>[15](#fn_629.md) of which he can eat during the Moed,
may be pickled.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[193:3](etm100.htm#fr_620.md) In order that they
may be distinguished, so that persons avoid contracting uncleanness.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[193:4](etm100.htm#fr_621.md) As such inspectors
were sent out at the cost of the public, it was generally done on the
middle days of the festivals, because, not having any other work to do,
the men hired to act as inspectors were to be had at a smaller charge
than at other times of the year.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[193:5](etm100.htm#fr_622.md) Either by rain or by
the hand of man.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[193:6](etm100.htm#fr_623.md) Any occupation, the
omission of which might cause loss or injury, is permitted during the
Moed. R. Eleazar thinks, that as the plants have done hitherto without
water, further delay cannot injure them. The sages, however, are of a
different opinion.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[193:7](etm100.htm#fr_624.md) Some departure from
the usual way of setting a gin, &c. must be adopted.

<span id="fn_622"></span>[193:8](etm100.htm#fr_625.md) Breaches in the wall
of an inhabited house may be regularly rebuilt.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[193:9](etm100.htm#fr_626.md) R. Meir thinks the
inspecting priest is at liberty to reserve his opinion, should it be
unfavourable, so as not to afflict the sufferer. But the sages hold he
is bound at once to pronounce his opinion.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[193:10](etm100.htm#fr_627.md) Who have been some
time deceased.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[194:11](etm100.htm#fr_628.md) ‏יבם‎, the duty of
marrying the childless widow of a deceased brother. Vide Treatise
Yebamoth.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[194:12](etm100.htm#fr_629.md) And must not
interfere with the general joy arising from the festival.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[194:13](etm100.htm#fr_630.md) Should they be too
smooth, so as not to grind, they may not be chipped or sharpened during
the Moed.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[194:14](etm100.htm#fr_631.md) According to
Bartenora, it must be rendered, "and then smoothened \[with hand and
foot as if\] with a roller."

<span id="fn_629"></span>[194:15](etm100.htm#fr_632.md) Edibles which
require to be cured in salt or in vinegar, as fish, colewort, and the
like.
