<p>&sect; 1. The prohibition to carry or convey [from one reshuth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> into another] on the Sabbath, is twofold; which [according to the decision of the sages], form four [prohibitions for him who is] inside [of the reshuth]; and also twofold which [according to the decision of the sages], form four [prohibitions for him who is] outside [of the reshuth]. How is this to be understood? A mendicant stands outside [of the private property], and the master of the house inside [of it]:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> should the mendicant put his hand in [to the private reshuth], and [either] put [his wallet] into the master's hand, or take something out of it [the master's hand into his own], and draw his hand back, [into the public reshuth, in which he is standing], the mendicant is guilty, but the master of the house is absolved. Should the master stretch out his hand [into the public reshuth in which the mendicant is standing,] and put [his gift] into the hand of the mendicant, or take [the wallet] out of it, and draw his hand back [into the house or private reshuth in which he is], the master of the house is guilty, but the mendicant is absolved. Should the mendicant put his hand in, and the master take [the wallet] out of it, or put [his gift] into it, and the mendicant [then] draw his hand out, both are absolved. Should the master stretch out his hand, and the mendicant take [the gift] out of it, or put [his wallet] into it, both are absolved.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 2. A man is not to sit down to the barber, near the time of &#8207;&#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;&#8206; until he has said his prayers;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> nor must man [about that</p>

<p>time on the Sabbath-eve] visit the bath, or the tan-yard; he must not sit down to his meal, nor yet in judgment; but if he have begun [to do either] he needs not leave off. [The study of the Law] is to be interrupted for the Shemang, but not for the Tephilah.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 3. The tailor must not go out with his needle near dusk [on the Sabbath-eve], lest he forget and carry it out with him [during the Sabbath]. The scribe [writer] is not to go out with his writing-reed [pen]; nor must a man cleanse his garments of vermin, or read by candle-light [on the Sabbath-eve]. They [the sages] have indeed permitted [that] a teacher may superintend children, who are reading [by candle-light], but he [himself] must not read. From the same motive [to avoid the possible occasion to sin] a man afflicted with a running issue, must not take his meals with a woman afflicted with the same disease.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 4. The following are among the decisions enacted in the Upper Hall of Hananiah, the son of Hezekiah, the son of Giorion, when they [the sages] went thither, and went up to visit him. On that occasion the sages present were counted, and [the sages of] the school of Shammai were found to be more numerous than [those of] the school of Hillel. On that day eighteen enactments were decreed.</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to soak the materials for making ink, or drugs for dying, or vetch [to feed cattle] [on the Sabbath-eve], unless there be time sufficient to soak it through, during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]: but Beth Hillel permit it.</p>  
<p>&sect; 6. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to put bundles of flax into the oven [on the Sabbath-eve], unless there be time sufficient to steam [dry] them during the day; nor to put wool into the dye-kettle, unless there be time sufficient for the wool to imbibe the dye during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]: all of which Beth Hillel permit. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to spread [set] nets for game, fowl, or fish [on the Sabbath-eve], unless there be time sufficient for it to be caught therein during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]: but Beth Hillel permit it.</p>  
<p>&sect; 7. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to sell any thing to a heathen [on the Sabbath-eve], or to help him to load, or to load for him, unless there be time sufficient for him to reach a neighbouring</p>

<p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></A></p>  
<p>town [or village] during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]: but Beth Hillel permit it.</p>  
<p>&sect; 8. Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to deliver skins to a heathen tanner, or clothes to a heathen laundress [on the Sabbath-eve], unless there he time enough for them to be got ready during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]: all of this Beth Hillel permit to be done, while the sun remains above the horizon.</p>  
<p>&sect; 9. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "It was the custom in my father's house, to deliver white garments to the heathen laundress three days before Sabbath." [Both schools] agree, that it is permitted to put blocks on the oil-press, and the round logs on the wine-press near the coming in of the Sabbath].&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 10. Neither meat, onions, nor eggs, must be fried [on the Sabbath-eve], unless there be time sufficient for them to get quite done during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]. Bread must not be put into the oven towards dusk [nightfall] on the Sabbath-eve, nor cakes on the coals, unless there be time enough for the surface to become crusted during the day [before the Sabbath comes in], R. Eleazar saith [unless there be time sufficient for] the bottom to become crusted.</p>  
<p>&sect; 11. It is permitted to put the paschal offering into the oven towards dusk on the Sabbath-eve&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> And the priests [in the Temple] may stir the fire a little in the hearth-room,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> but in other halls [of the Temple] only if there is time sufficient for the fire to seize on the greater part of the wood. R. Jehudah saith of coals, "if any part of them be ignited [before the Sabbath come in]."</p>
