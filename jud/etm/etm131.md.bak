*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER XII.

§ 1. He that marries a woman, who stipulates that he is to maintain her
daughter \[by a former husband\] five years, is bound to maintain her
during the five years. \[If he divorces his wife, and\] she marries
another man, with whom she likewise stipulates that he is to maintain
her daughter five years, he is \[also\] bound to maintain her during the
five years. The first husband is not entitled to say, "When she comes to
me I will maintain her," but he must bring her maintenance to the place
where she is with her mother. Neither are the two husbands at liberty to
say, "We will jointly maintain her," but the one must maintain her, and
the other give her the value of her maintenance in money.

§ 2. Should she \[the daughter spoken of in the preceding Mishna\] marry
\[during the stipulated period of five years\], her husband furnishes
her maintenance, and they \[her mother's two husbands\] must give her
the amount of her maintenance in money. Should they die, their own
daughters are maintained out of their unencumbered property. whilst she
must be maintained \[even\] out of their encumbered \[alienated\]
property, because she is \[possessed of the same rights\] as a
\[mortgage\] creditor. Prudent men stipulated, <span
id="fr_956"></span>[1](#fn_951.md) "On condition that I maintain thy
daughter during five years, provided thou art living with me."

§ 3. Should a widow declare, "I will not remove from my husband's
house," the heirs cannot say to her, "Depart to thy father's house and
we will there maintain thee;" but they must maintain her in her
husband's house, and provide her a dwelling in accordance with her
dignity \[rank and station in society\]. <span
id="fr_957"></span>[2](#fn_952.md) Should she declare, "I will not remove
from my father's house," the heirs may reply, "While thou art with us
thou shalt have thy maintenance, but if thou art not with us, thou shalt
not have thy maintenance." Should she object to this, because she
herself is young, and the heirs

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

likewise are young, they are bound to furnish her maintenance, and she
continues in her father's house.

§ 4. While she continues in her father's house, <span
id="fr_958"></span>[3](#fn_953.md) she is entitled at any time to claim
\[the amount of\] her Ketubah: but if she remained in her husband's
house \[she is entitled to claim it only during\] twenty-five years; for
in the twenty-five years she will have done \[herself\] good, <span
id="fr_959"></span>[4](#fn_954.md) \[derived benefits\] equal to \[the
amount of\] her Ketubah. Such is the dictum of R. Meir, which he
advanced on the authority of R. Simeon ben Gamaliel; but the sages hold,
"As long as she remains in her husband's house, she is entitled at any
time to claim her Ketubah; as long as she remains in her father's house,
she is entitled to claim her Ketubah \[only during\] twenty-five years.
If she dies, her heirs can claim \[the amount of\] her Ketubah \[only\]
before the expiration of the twenty-five years."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_951"></span>[273:1](etm131.htm#fr_956.md) In the Ketubah
which, under such circumstances, they signed.

<span id="fn_952"></span>[273:2](etm131.htm#fr_957.md) This comprises the
use of the furniture and utensils which she had been in the habit of
using during the lifetime of her husband, and also the services of the
male and female domestics, to whose attendance she is accustomed.

<span id="fn_953"></span>[274:3](etm131.htm#fr_958.md) Where the husband's
heirs allow her a maintenance.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[274:4](etm131.htm#fr_959.md) The text has ‏שתעשה
טובה‎ "she will have done good." Some commentators interpret, "that she
will have done good to the poor," others "that she will have treated her
neighbours and visitors to an amount equal to her Ketubah." Jost, in his
translation, has adopted their rendering; we have, however, preferred
adopting the simple wording of the text.
