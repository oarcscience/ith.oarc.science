### CHAPTER XV.

§ 1. When a woman departed with her husband to a distant country, and
they had there lived peaceably together, and peace also prevailed in the
world, should the woman return and say, "My husband died \[abroad\],"
she may marry again, or in case of *Yeboom*, be married accordingly to
her late husband's brother. Should this married couple have lived
peacefully together, but that war had then prevailed in the world, or
that they had disagreed with each other, but peace prevailed in the
world, her evidence \[of her husband's death\] is not to receive
credence. <span id="fr_760"></span>[1](#fn_755.md) R. Jehudah says, "She is
in no

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

instance to be believed, except when she appears crying, and with rent
garments." The sages said to him, "This is not of any consequence
\[whether she appears weeping or not\], she may re-marry." <span
id="fr_761"></span>[2](#fn_756.md)

§ 2. Beth Hillel say, "We have heard this applied only in a certain
case, where the woman came back from harvest, and in the province only
in which the occurrence <span id="fr_762"></span>[3](#fn_757.md) took
place." But Beth Shammai replied to Beth Hillel, "It is immaterial
whether the woman came back from wheat harvest, olive gathering, the
vintage, or from another country; the word 'harvest' was used by the
sages for no other reason, than because the occurrence thus happened."
Then Beth Hillel abandoned their former opinion, and adopted that of
Beth Shammai.

§ 3. According to Beth Shammai, such a woman may marry again, and
receive the amount of her *Ketubah*, but Beth Hillel hold, she may
marry, but has no claim to her *Ketubah*. Beth Shammai said unto them,
"You permitted \[the possible case of the commission of\] the grave sin
of adultery, <span id="fr_763"></span>[4](#fn_758.md) and yet you refuse
your permission in money matters, <span id="fr_764"></span>[5](#fn_759.md)
which are of such minor importance." Beth Hillel replied, "\[We decided
thus,\] because we find that her husband's brothers cannot succeed to
the estate of their deceased brother on her unsupported evidence." Beth
Shammai answered, "The sum which her husband promised her we learn from
her marriage-contract. <span id="fr_765"></span>[6](#fn_760.md) For thus it
is there stated: 'In case thou shouldst marry another husband, thou art
to receive what is here assigned to thee.'" Then Beth Hillel abandoned
their former opinion, and taught like Beth Shammai.

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

§ 4. Every one is deemed a trustworthy witness to testify to a woman,
concerning her husband's decease, except her mother-in-law, the daughter
of the latter, her own rival, her sister-in-law, or her husband's \[or
step\] daughter. <span id="fr_766"></span>[7](#fn_761.md) Why is this
distinction made between the evidence \[of a wife\] who alleges to have
received a divorce from her husband, and one who bears witness to his
decease?—Because the written document <span
id="fr_767"></span>[8](#fn_762.md) proves the matter \[more
satisfactorily\]. If one witness said, "Your husband is dead," upon
which the widow received permission to marry again, though another
witness should subsequently contradict this evidence, and say, "Your
husband is not dead," she does not lose her right to re-marry, but when
a witness, \[incompetent to give evidence\] should say, "He is dead,"
and two witnesses \[in the same predicament\] should afterwards say, "He
is not dead," she must even when she was already married \[upon the
first evidence\], have that \[last\] marriage dissolved. When two
\[such\] witnesses say, "He is dead," and another \[such\] says, "He is
not dead," then, even when she did not marry upon the evidence of the
first-mentioned, she may marry after, notwithstanding the last evidence.

§ 5. When one \[of two wives coming from a distant country\] says, "Our
husband is dead," and the other, "He is not dead," she, who averred to
his decease, may marry again, and is entitled to the sum assigned to her
in her *Ketubah*, but she who made the contrary averment, may neither
marry, nor is entitled to the amount of her *Ketubah*. When one wife
declared their husband died \[naturally\], the other, that he was
murdered, R. Meir holds that they may not marry, owing to this
discrepance in their evidence, but R. Jehudah and R. Simeon opine, that
since both agree in the fact of his being no longer alive, they may
marry again. Should one witness say, "The man is dead," and another
testify to the contrary effect, or that one woman says, "He is dead,"
and another, "He is not dead," the wife may not marry again \[upon this
evidence\].

§ 6. When a woman and her husband had gone to a distant country, and the
woman returns, and says, "My husband is dead," she may marry again, and
is entitled to the amount of her marriage contract, but her rival may
not re-marry \[upon her evidence

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

alone\]. If this latter is an Israelitess married to a priest, she may,
according to R. Tarphon, continue to eat heave, but R. Akivah says,
"This is not the proper way to keep her from transgression. She must be
prohibited to marry, and also to eat heave \[any longer\]."

§ 7. Should a wife say, "My husband died first, and my father-in-law
afterwards," she is entitled to marry again, and to receive the amount
of her *Ketubah*, but not her mother-in-law, and if this latter was an
Israelitess married to a priest, she may, according to R. Tarphon,
continue to eat heave; but R. Akivah saith, "This is not the proper way
to keep her from transgression. She must be prohibited to re-marry, and
also to eat heave." If a person had betrothed one of five women, and did
not know with certainty which of them he had betrothed, and each of
these women claims to be the betrothed one, he must give a *Get* to
each, and deposit the amount of a *Ketubah*, <span
id="fr_768"></span>[9](#fn_763.md) when he has no further responsibility.
Such is the dictum of R. Tarphon, but R. Akivah says, "This is not the
proper way to preserve him from transgression. He must give a *Get* and
the amount of a *Ketubah* to each woman." A thief who had robbed one of
five persons, and does not know which, each of the five declaring that
he was the person robbed, must deposit the amount of the theft \[with
the tribunal, for their decision\], after which he has no further
responsibility. Such is the dictum of R. Tarphon, but R. Akivah saith,
"This is not the proper way to preserve him from transgression. He must
pay to each the value of the theft."

§ 8. When a woman went with her husband and son to a distant country,
and she returns and says, "My husband died first, and my son
afterwards," she is to be believed, <span
id="fr_769"></span>[10](#fn_764.md) but if she said, "My son died first,
and afterwards my husband," she is not to receive entire credence for
her words, and only in so far to be regarded, that she is only permitted
to perform *Chalitzah* to her brother-in-law, but cannot be married to
him by *Yeboom*.

§ 9. When she says, "A son was born unto me abroad, who died, and then
my husband also died," she is to receive credence, but if she said, "My
husband died first, and then my son," she is not to be credited, yet her
words are so far regarded, that she is only permitted to receive
*Chalitzah* from her brother-in-law, but cannot be married to him by
*Yeboom*.

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

§ 10. If she says, "A brother-in-law was there born to me," <span
id="fr_770"></span>[11](#fn_765.md) and adds, "My husband died first, and
then my brother-in-law," or, "My brother-in-law died first, and then my
husband," she is to be believed. If she went abroad with her husband and
brother-in-law, and says on her return, "My husband died first, and then
my brother-in-law," or, "My brother-in-law died first, and then my
husband," she is not to be believed. For a woman is not entitled to full
credence when she says, "My brother-in-law dies," as \[it is possible\]
she makes that assertion only \[to be permitted\] to marry again.
Neither when she says, "My sister died," so as to enable her to be
married to her brother-in-law. A man also is not to be believed on his
own assertion, when he says, "My wife died," as it is possible he may
wish to marry her sister.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_755"></span>[233:1](etm117.htm#fr_760.md) Because under the
mentioned circumstances it is to be apprehended that she made this
allegation to become separated from a husband with whom she disagreed,
or that in time of war she might allege that which amounts only to <span
id="page_234">p. 234</span> presumptive evidence as certain; *ex. gr.*,
if her husband promised her to return at a certain time, and did not,
when she presumed him to have been slain, or that she saw him wounded,
and thought he was killed, it being possible that he may yet return, or
be cured.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[234:2](etm117.htm#fr_761.md) For otherwise an
artful woman who pretended to cry, &c. might have an undue advantage
over an artless one.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[234:3](etm117.htm#fr_762.md) This occurrence, to
which frequent allusion is here made, was, that a man while engaged in
the wheat harvest, was killed by the bite of a venomous snake. The wife
alleged this to the *Beth Din*, and when on examination they found this
allegation to be true, they permitted her to marry again, and decreed
that henceforth the \[unsupported\] evidence of a wife may, in a similar
case, be received as valid.

<span id="fn_758"></span>[234:4](etm117.htm#fr_763.md) By granting her
permission to re-marry, when her husband may perhaps be alive, and her
evidence be a false one.

<span id="fn_759"></span>[234:5](etm117.htm#fr_764.md) Namely, the amount
of her *Ketubah* assigned to her at her marriage with the former
husband.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[234:6](etm117.htm#fr_765.md) That is, our opinion
is founded on the very wording of the *Ketubah*.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[235:7](etm117.htm#fr_766.md) Because these
females are suspected of hearing her ill will, and may wish to bring her
to shame.

<span id="fn_762"></span>[235:8](etm117.htm#fr_767.md) Namely, the *Get*
she alleges to have been written and signed in her presence.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[236:9](etm117.htm#fr_768.md) With the *Beth Din*,
and leave it to their decision to give it to her who may be best
entitled to it.

<span id="fn_764"></span>[236:10](etm117.htm#fr_769.md) And released from
the law of *Yeboom*.

<span id="fn_765"></span>[237:11](etm117.htm#fr_770.md) Namely, a brother
of her husband, which subjects her to *Yeboom*.
