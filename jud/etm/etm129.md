### CHAPTER X.

§ 1. \[In the case of\] him who married two wives, and dies, the first
wife has a priority <span id="fr_920"></span>[1](#fn_915.md) before the
second, and the heirs of the first \[wife\] <span
id="fr_921"></span>[2](#fn_916.md) before the heirs of the second wife. Had
he first married one wife, who died, and then married the second, at his
own decease the second wife and her heirs have a priority before the
heirs of the first wife.

§ 2. \[In the case of\] him that married two wives, both of whom died
before his own decease, and when the orphan children claim the Ketubah
of their mothers, \[while\] there is no more \[property\] than the
\[exact amount of the\] two Ketuboth, <span
id="fr_922"></span>[3](#fn_917.md) they divide \[it between the two sets of
orphans, share and share\] alike. But if there is \[any\] surplus
\[property beyond the exact amount of the two Ketuboth, even though that
surplus be but a single\] dinar, the orphans

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

of each mother receive the amount of her Ketubah. <span
id="fr_923"></span>[4](#fn_918.md) Should the orphans <span
id="fr_924"></span>[5](#fn_919.md) propose: "We will appraise the property
of our father one dinar higher \[than the real value\]," they are not to
be listened to, but the Bethdin must cause the property to be appraised.

§ 3. Should there be any property in expectancy, it is not \[to be
considered\] as in \[actual\] possession. <span
id="fr_925"></span>[6](#fn_920.md) R. Simeon saith, "Even though there be
moveable property \[beyond the amount of the two Ketuboth\], it is not
\[to be included in the computation\], but there must be immoveable
property, exceeding \[in value the amount of\] the two Ketuboth \[by at
least\] a dinar.

§ 4. He who married three wives and dies, the Ketubah of one \[wife\]
being one hundred dinar, of one \[wife\] two hundred, and of one, three
hundred \[dinar\], while there is only \[property left to the value of\]
one hundred \[dinar\], they divide \[it between them, share and share\]
alike. <span id="fr_926"></span>[7](#fn_921.md) If there be \[property to
the value of\] two hundred dinar, she \[whose Ketubah amounts\] to a
maneh, receives fifty dinar, while she of two hundred and she of three
hundred dinar receive three gold-pieces \[each gold-piece at twenty-five
dinar\]. Should there be \[property to the value of\] three hundred
dinar, she \[whose Ketubah is\] of one hundred dinar receives fifty, she
of two hundred receives one hundred, and she of three hundred dinar
receives one hundred and fifty \[dinar\]. In like manner, three who join
their funds \[form a co-partnership\], whether they have diminished or
increased their capital, the above is \[the proportion to be observed\]
in which they divide.

§ 5. \[Of\] him who married four wives and dies, the first wife has
priority <span id="fr_927"></span>[8](#fn_922.md) before the second, the
second before the third, and the third before the fourth. The first is
put upon her oath by the second, the second by the third, the third by
the fourth, but the fourth recovers her Ketubah without being
sworn. <span id="fr_928"></span>[9](#fn_923.md) Ben Nanas saith,

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "What! because she
is the last is she to be favored? She likewise cannot recover without
being sworn." Should \[the Ketuboth\] have all been executed on the same
day, whichever \[of them\] precedes the others even by one hour, enjoys
\[the priority\]. <span id="fr_929"></span>[10](#fn_924.md) Therefore in
Jerusalem they inserted the hour. <span id="fr_930"></span>[11](#fn_925.md)
Should all \[the Ketuboth\] have been executed in the same hour, and
there is no more \[property left\] than \[to the value of\] a maneh,
they divide \[it between them, share and share\] alike. <span
id="fr_931"></span>[12](#fn_926.md)

§ 6. \[Of\] him who has married two wives, and sells his land, <span
id="fr_932"></span>[13](#fn_927.md) should the first wife undertake in
writing to the purchaser, "Right and claim have I none against
thee," <span id="fr_933"></span>[14](#fn_928.md) the second \[wife\] may
\[nevertheless\] recover the land from the purchaser. <span
id="fr_934"></span>[15](#fn_929.md) But then the first \[wife\] recovers it
from the second, <span id="fr_935"></span>[16](#fn_930.md) and the
purchaser again recovers it from the first \[wife\], <span
id="fr_936"></span>[17](#fn_931.md) and thus the title \[and possession of
the field\] keeps shifting \[from one to the other\] until they come to
an arrangement. Such is also the case with a creditor, <span
id="fr_937"></span>[18](#fn_932.md) and if the wife proceeds as a
creditor. <span id="fr_938"></span>[19](#fn_933.md)

virtue of the renunciation, has a right to come upon A, who again comes
upon C, and so on, till some arrangement is made.

<span id="fn_933"></span>[270:19](etm129.htm#fr_938.md) Should the land on
