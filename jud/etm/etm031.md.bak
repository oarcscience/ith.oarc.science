*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER IX.

§ 1. R. Akivah saith, "Whence is it \[to be inferred\] that carrying an
idol maketh unclean, even as menstruation doth? From the text, 'Thou
shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth: thou shalt say unto it \[the
idol\], get thee hence.' <span id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_121.md) Even as
the carrying of a menstruous cloth defileth, so does likewise the
carrying of an idol."

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

§ 2. Whence is it \[to be inferred\] that a ship is clean? From the
text, "The way of a ship in the heart \[midst\] of the sea." <span
id="fr_122"></span>[2](#fn_122.md) Whence is it \[to be inferred\] that in
a garden-bed, six hands square, five different kinds of seed may be
sown; \[i.e.\] four \[kinds\] in the four corners of the garden-bed, and
the fifth in the middle? <span id="fr_123"></span>[3](#fn_123.md) From the
text, "For as the earth, bringeth forth her bud, and the garden causeth
‏זְרוּעֶיהָ‎, her seeds, to spring forth." <span
id="fr_124"></span>[4](#fn_124.md) The text does not say, ‏זַרְעָהּ‎ \[her
seed, in the singular, as if of one kind only\], but ‏זְרוּעֶיהָ‎, \[her
seeds of various kinds\].

§ 3. Whence is it \[to be inferred\] that a woman who sheds semen on the
third day \[after coition\] is unclean? From the text, "And be ye ready
against the third day." <span id="fr_125"></span>[5](#fn_125.md) Whence is
it \[to be inferred\] that a circumcised infant is to be bathed
\[washed\] on the third day \[after circumcision\], even though that
falls on the Sabbath? From the text, "And it came to pass on the third
day, when they were sore," <span id="fr_126"></span>[6](#fn_126.md) Whence
is it \[to be inferred\] that a red string is to be tied to the head of
the scapegoat? <span id="fr_127"></span>[7](#fn_127.md) From the text,
"Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall become white as snow." <span
id="fr_128"></span>[8](#fn_128.md)

§ 4. Whence is it \[to be inferred\] that anointing is \[as unlawful\]
as drinking on the day of atonement? Although there is no \[absolute
proof\] for this assertion, there is an indication thereof in the text,
"Let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his
bones." <span id="fr_129"></span>[9](#fn_129.md)

§ 5. He \[is likewise guilty\] who carries out wood sufficient to boil a
light egg, spices sufficient to season a light egg; and \[different
kinds of spice are to be\] computed together. Nut-shells, pomegranate
peels, isatis \[woad\], and madder, sufficient to dye a small cap-cloth;
urine, alum, ‏בורית‎, and ‏קמוליא‎ and ‏אשלג‎, <span
id="fr_130"></span>[10](#fn_130.md) sufficient to wash a small cap-cloth.
R. Jehudah saith, "sufficient to pass over a blood-stain, \[by way of
experiment to see if it can be taken out\]."

§ 6. Pimento the smallest quantity, extract of pitch the smallest
quantity; all kinds of spice \[perfumes\] and of metals \[ores\] the
smallest quantity. Altar stones and altar dust, <span
id="fr_131"></span>[11](#fn_131.md) fragments of rolls of

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

the law, and fragments of their wrappers \[gnawed to pieces by moths\]
the smallest quantity; because these things are preserved to be
secreted. R. Jehudah saith, also, "whoever carries out the smallest
quantity of what has been used for idol-worship; for it is said, 'And
there shall cleave nought of the accursed thing to thine hand.'" <span
id="fr_132"></span>[12](#fn_132.md)

If a man carry out the box of a dealer in spices \[apothecary\],
although there be various kinds \[of spice\] therein, he is \[only\]
bound to bring one sin-offering. Garden seeds, \[rather\] less than the
size of a dried fig. R. Jehudah ben Bethera saith, "Five \[things there
are of which, should a man carry the smallest quantity, he is guilty\],
cucumber seeds two \[grains\],pumpkin seeds two \[grains\],Egyptian
bean-seed \[two grains\], a clean <span id="fr_133"></span>[13](#fn_133.md)
live grasshopper any portion \[however small\], \[if it be\] dead the
size of a dried fig. A vineyard bird <span
id="fr_134"></span>[14](#fn_134.md) any \[the smallest\] portion \[be it\]
dead or alive." R. Jehudah saith, "He likewise \[is guilty\]who carries
out any \[the smallest\] portion of an unclean live grasshopper, because
these are preserved for children to play with."

<span id="fn_130"></span>[50:10](etm031.htm#fr_130.md) Commentators do not
satisfactorily explain the meaning of these three words. Dr. Jost
asserts, that ‏בורית‎ is alkaline salt; that ‏אשלג‎, derived from ‏שלג‎,
snow, is a kind of frothy soap; and that ‏קמוליא‎ is the creta-cimolia,
of which Pliny states (Hist. Nat. lib. v. 57), that it is used for
washing.

eaten. (Vide Lev. xi. 22).

<span id="fn_134"></span>[51:14](etm031.htm#fr_134.md) It is nowhere
explained what particular bird is meant by this designation; probably it
is grasshopper. (Vide Choolin, fo. 65).
