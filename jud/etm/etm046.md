*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,

### CHAPTER XXIV.

§ 1. He who \[on the Sabbath-eve\] is overtaken by the dusk on the road
must give his purse to a heathen. If there be no heathen with him he
must put it on the ass. As soon as he arrives at the outmost court
\[dwelling of the first town or village he reaches\] he

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

takes off all such things as may be moved on the Sabbath; as to those
things which must not be moved he loosens the cords, that they may fall
off by themselves.

§ 2. They may untie bundles of straw for cattle; also to strew green
boughs \[stalks for them\], but they must not undo bundles trebly tied.
Herbs used as fodder, and carob pods, must not be cut up for cattle, be
it large or small \[kine or sheep\]. R. Jehudah permits the cutting up
of carob pods for small cattle.

§ 3. A camel must not be crammed \[to fatten it\]; nor yet forced to
eat; but the food may be put into its mouth. Calves must not be crammed,
but the food may be put into their mouths. Poultry may be fed: water may
be poured on bran, but it must not be kneaded. They must not put water
before bees, or before pigeons in a dovecot; but they may put \[it\]
before geese, and before poultry, and before house pigeons \[tame
ones\].

§ 4. Pumpkins may be cut up for cattle, and carrion for dogs. R. Jehudah
saith, "If the carrion was not such \[if the beast had not died\] on the
Sabbath-eve \[or before\], it must not be cut up; because \[in that
case\] it is not \[part\] of what has been provided \[for the necessary
consumption of the Sabbath\].

§ 5. A man may annul \[disallow\] vows \[of his wife or
daughter\], <span id="fr_175"></span>[1](#fn_175) on the Sabbath, and
consult \[a sage\] as to vows \[relating to objects required\] for the
Sabbath. Window light may be shut out by blinds; a piece of stuff may be
measured, <span id="fr_176"></span>[2](#fn_176) and also a ‏מקוה‎. <span
id="fr_177"></span>[3](#fn_177) It happened in the days of R. Zadock's
father, and of Abbah Saul, that they closed a window with an earthen
vessel, and then tied another vessel to a pole with withies, in order to
ascertain whether, in a covered vessel \[that stood on a kennel between
two houses\] there was an opening one hand high or not. <span
id="fr_178"></span>[4](#fn_178) Thence we learn that \[in certain
cases\] it may become permitted to stop up \[close\], to measure, and to
tie, on the Sabbath.
