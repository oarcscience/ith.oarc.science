### Concerning the Number of Members in the Greater and Lesser Sanhedrins.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>I. 6. The Great Sanhedrin consisted
of seventy-one members, and the Lesser of twenty-three. Whence do we
know that the Great Sanhedrin should consist of seventy-one? It is
written: <span id="fr_121"></span>[4](#fn_120.md) GATHER UNTO ME SEVENTY
MEN OF THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL. These with Moses make

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>seventy-one. R. Jehuda holds that
there should be seventy only. And whence do we know that the Lesser
Sanhedrin should consist of twenty-three? It is written: <span
id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_121.md) AND THE CONGREGATION SHALL JUDGE;
also, <span id="fr_123"></span>[2](#fn_122.md) AND THE CONGREGATION SHALL
DELIVER; one congregation judges and one congregation delivers. Hence we
have twenty. How do we know that a congregation was made up of ten? It
is written: <span id="fr_124"></span>[3](#fn_123.md) How LONG SHALL I
ENDURE THIS EVIL CONGREGATION?--that is the twelve spies, excluding
Joshua and Caleb. And whence do we get the additional three? From the
meaning of the passage: <span id="fr_125"></span>[4](#fn_124.md) THOU SHALT
NOT FOLLOW AFTER THE MANY TO DO EVIL, from which it is to be understood
that one must be with them for good. If so, why is it said: AFTER MANY
TO CHANGE JUDGMENT? To change to good is not the same as to change to
evil, since the former requires but a majority of one, whereas the
latter requires two. <span id="fr_126"></span>[5](#fn_125.md) And since the
court must not be divisible equally they add one more. Hence we have
twenty-three. How many should there be in a city to make it eligible for
a Sanhedrin? A hundred and twenty families. R. Nehemia <span
id="fr_127"></span>[6](#fn_126.md) says: Two hundred and thirty, to enable
the number twenty-three to correspond with the heads of groups of ten
families.

**T**. III. 7. Whence do we know that the Lesser Sanhedrin should
consist of twenty-three? It is

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

written: THE CONGREGATION SHALL JUDGE; also, AND THE CONGREGATION SHALL
DELIVER; that is to say, ten acquit and ten condemn. And the three?
Scripture says: THOU SHALT NOT FOLLOW AFTER THE MANY TO DO EVIL, from
which it is to be inferred that thou art not to be with them for evil
but for good. Perhaps thou art not with them for evil in any way?
Scripture says: AFTER THE MANY TO AFFECT THE VERDICT, as well as for
evil. Since the Law says that we should put to death in accordance with
the evidence of witnesses, and also according to the verdict of the
majority: then as two witnesses are necessary to secure a conviction, so
a majority of two is necessary (for a verdict of condemnation). The
court must not be divisible equally, so one more is added. Hence we have
twenty-three.

Rabbi says: The additional three is adduced from the meaning of the
passage: THOU SHALT NOT FOLLOW AFTER THE MANY TO DO EVIL, from which it
is to be understood that one must be with them for good. If so, why is
it said: AFTER MANY TO CHANGE JUDGMENT? To change to good is not the
same as to change to evil, since the former requires a majority of one,
whereas the latter requires two. And since the court must not be
divisible equally, they add one more. Hence we have twenty-three.

8\. R. Jose <span id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_127.md) the Galilaean
says: <span id="fr_129"></span>[2](#fn_128.md) THOU SHALT NOT
*REFRAIN* <span id="fr_130"></span>[3](#fn_129.md) IN A LEGAL CASE FROM
MAKING A DECISION means: Make the court able to form a definite
decision.

Another explanation: THOU SHALT NOT REFRAIN IN A LEGAL CASE FROM MAKING
A DECISION; therefore Scripture adds one more to the court to form

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

a majority. AFTER RABBIM <span id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_130.md) TO AFFECT
THE VERDICT; *i.e.* that thou mayest not say at the time of the trial,
"It is enough that I hold the same view as my *master*." But say what is
in thy mind.

9\. R. Jehuda says: The (greater) Sanhedrin is of seventy only, since
Moses was included in the number of the elders. It was replied: The
court may not be of an even number.

Thus also used R. Jehuda to say: Every city in which are three rows of
twenty-three, and officers of the judges, and the accuser and the
witnesses, and their refuters and the refuters of their refuters, is
fitted to have a Sanhedrin. R. Nehemia says: There must be two hundred
and thirty in all. And the *Halaka* is according to him. <span
id="fr_132"></span>[2](#fn_131.md) Rabbi says: Two hundred and seventy.

10\. The Sanhedrin can practise both within and without the land of
Israel. It is written: <span id="fr_133"></span>[3](#fn_132.md) AND THESE
THINGS SHALL BE TO YOU FOR A STATUTE OF JUDGMENT UNTO YOU THROUGHOUT
YOUR GENERATIONS IN ALL YOUR DWELLINGS; that is, both within and without
the land. If this is so, why is it written: JUDGES AND OFFICERS SHALT
THOU MAKE THEE IN ALL THY GATES? <span id="fr_134"></span>[4](#fn_133.md)
Within the land of Israel they make them in every city; but outside the
land, they make them in every province. R. Shimeon, the son of Gamaliel,
says: ACCORDING TO THY TRIBES, AND THEY SHALL JUDGE, <span
id="fr_135"></span>[5](#fn_134.md) ordains that each tribe shall be
self-governing.

11\. R. Dostai, <span id="fr_136"></span>[6](#fn_135.md) the son of Jehuda,
says: Those guilty of death who have fled from the land of Israel

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

to another land, can be put to death at once. But those who have fled
from another land to the land of Israel, cannot be put to death unless
judged anew.

this in *M*. 4. I.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[43:6](tsa06.htm#fr_127.md) R. Nehemia was one of
the later pupils of R. Akiba.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[44:1](tsa06.htm#fr_128.md) A distinguished
contemporary of R. Akiba, and, it is said, the only one who ever
successfully opposed him. See for such a clash of opinions, *T*. xiv. 6.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[44:3](tsa06.htm#fr_130.md) R. V. has "neither
shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside." The word here rendered
"speak" has in later Hebrew, in the *piel* conjugation, the meaning
given by R. Jose.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[45:1](tsa06.htm#fr_131.md) Instead of its usual
meaning--"the many," it is here regarded as the plural of Rabbi--"my
master."

<span id="fn_131"></span>[45:2](tsa06.htm#fr_132.md) See Exod. 18. 21. The
least of the judges appointed were rulers over ten. Therefore for a
council of twenty-three there must be a population of not less than two
hundred and thirty.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[45:6](tsa06.htm#fr_136.md) R. Dostai b. Jehuda
belonged to the latter end of the second century. He was possibly a
pupil of R. Shimeon b. Jochai.
