### Footnotes

<span id="fn_379"></span>[119:2](tsa36.htm#fr_383) Meaning uncertain.
The majority of Jewish commentators treat as the name of an idol. A
possible interpretation is, that it is an abbreviation of some
transliterated unorthodox divine name, such as, for example,
κοσμοπλάστης, or a disguised form of the Tetragrammaton. The criminal is

VII. 5). Although he cannot be legally stoned, he may become the object
of irregular justice.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[119:3](tsa36.htm#fr_384) On the ground of
Numb. 25. 6-15.

III. 2), he can only be punished by scourging.

VI. ll. 4; V. v. 2; *Ant*. XV. xi. 5; from which it is to be gathered

The well-known Temple barrier inscription discovered in 1871 reads: "No
man of another nation to enter within the fence and enclosure round the
Temple; and whoever is caught will have himself to blame that his death
follows." Cf. J. Armitage Robinson, *St. Paul's Epistle to the
Ephesians*, p. 160.
