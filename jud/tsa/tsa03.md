# TRACTATE SANHEDRIN

#### MISHNAH AND TOSEFTA

# I.--THE JURISDICTION OF THE VARIOUS COURTS

**Cases which can be tried by Three Judges**.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>I. 1. NON-CAPITAL <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) cases are to be tried by a tribunal of
three judges:--cases of robbery and personal violence, <span
id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md) by three; cases involving whole or half
damages, <span id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16.md) repaying double, <span
id="fr_17"></span>[4](#fn_17.md) or repaying fourfold or fivefold, <span
id="fr_18"></span>[5](#fn_18.md) and cases of forcing, <span
id="fr_19"></span>[6](#fn_19.md) seduction <span
id="fr_20"></span>[7](#fn_20.md) and libel, <span
id="fr_21"></span>[8](#fn_21.md) by three,--so R. Meir <span
id="fr_22"></span>[9](#fn_22.md); but the

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>majority <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) hold that a libel case should be tried by
a court of twenty-three judges, since it is a capital charge.

2\. Cases involving scourging, <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md) by
three  <span id="fr_25"></span>[3](#fn_25.md); the decision as to the
intercalation of the month  <span id="fr_26"></span>[4](#fn_26.md) and the
intercalation of the year, <span id="fr_27"></span>[5](#fn_27.md) by
three,--so R. Meir; but according to R. Shimeon, <span
id="fr_28"></span>[6](#fn_28.md) the son of R. Gamaliel, the case is begun
by three, discussed by five, and concluded by seven. But if it be
concluded by three only, the intercalation holds good.

3\. The "Laying on of the elders' hands,"  <span
id="fr_29"></span>[7](#fn_29.md) and the "Breaking of the heifer's neck "
 <span id="fr_30"></span>[8](#fn_30.md) are to be

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>determined by three according to R.
Shimeon, <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md) but R. Jehuda <span
id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md) says five; decisions as to
"*Ḥaliṣa*" <span id="fr_33"></span>[3](#fn_33.md) and "Refusal," <span
id="fr_34"></span>[4](#fn_34.md) by three; "Fourth year plants" <span
id="fr_35"></span>[5](#fn_35.md) and "Second tithe" <span
id="fr_36"></span>[6](#fn_36.md) of unknown value, by three; cases dealing
with consecrated articles, <span id="fr_37"></span>[7](#fn_37.md) by three;
valuations, if movable property, by three--according to R. Jehuda one of
them should be a priest: if real estate, by nine and a priest: if a man,
by the same number.

**T**. I. i. Non-capital cases are to be tried by three judges; but
according to Rabbi <span id="fr_38"></span>[8](#fn_38.md) they are to be

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

tried by five, so that the decision may be supported by three.
Arbitration may be effected by three,--so R. Meir; but the majority hold
that one suffices. The *Semika* <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md) is
to be decided by three, and the "Laying on of the elders’ hands" by
three; but R. Jehuda holds that it is by five.

2\. Movable vowed property, "Fourth year plants" and "Second tithe" of
unknown value are to be redeemed according to the verdict of three
experienced dealers in the particular commodity, and not according to
that of three who are not experienced.

An animal with an obvious blemish <span id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_40.md) is
to be slaughtered according to the verdict of any three members of the
synagogue,--so R. Meir; but R. Jose <span id="fr_41"></span>[3](#fn_41.md)
says: "Even though it be deformed in the leg and blind in the eye it can
be slaughtered only according to the verdict of an expert." The majority
hold that one who commits libel when the charge involves a non-capital
case is to be judged by three; but if a capital case, by twenty-three.

As three judges are required for legal judgment, so three are necessary
for arbitration. But when a case has been decided by legal judgment,
arbitration is not permitted. R. Eliezer, <span
id="fr_42"></span>[4](#fn_42.md) the son of R. Jose the Galilaean, says:
Every one who arbitrates (after judgment has been passed) is a sinner
and he who praises such an arbitrator blasphemes The Place. <span
id="fr_43"></span>[5](#fn_43.md)

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

Therefore it is said: HE WHO PRAISES THE ARBITRATOR (Heb. *boṣea*)
BLASPHEMES THE LORD. <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md) Let rather the
legal judgment pierce the very mountain. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md) For so used Moses to say: "Let legal
judgment pierce the very mountain;" whereas Aaron was accustomed to make
peace between man and man, as it is written: HE WALKED WITH ME IN PEACE
AND UPRIGHTNESS. <span id="fr_46"></span>[3](#fn_46.md) R. Eleazar, <span
id="fr_47"></span>[4](#fn_47.md) the son of Jacob, says: What does
Scripture mean by "*BOṢEA BEREK* <span id="fr_48"></span>[5](#fn_48.md)
BLASPHEMES THE LORD"? They told a parable: To what can this be compared?
It is like to a man who had stolen a *seâ* <span
id="fr_49"></span>[6](#fn_49.md) of wheat; he ground it and baked it and
set apart the *Ḥalla* <span id="fr_50"></span>[7](#fn_50.md) and fed his
children. When such a one recites the Blessing, he does not bless, but
he blasphemes. Hence it is written: WHEN THE ROBBER <span
id="fr_51"></span>[8](#fn_51.md) BLESSES HE BLASPHEMES THE LORD.

3\. Another explanation: HE WHO PRAISES THE *BOṢEA* <span
id="fr_52"></span>[9](#fn_52.md) BLASPHEMES THE LORD.

*Boṣea* refers to the brethren of Joseph who said: <span
id="fr_53"></span>[10](#fn_53.md) WHAT *BEṢA* HAVE WE IF WE SLAY OUR
BROTHER?

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

R. Jehoshua, <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) the son of Karha, said:
There is a command that we arbitrate, for it is written: <span
id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55.md) EXECUTE THE JUDGMENT OF TRUTH AND PEACE IN
YOUR GATES. But is it not the case that wherever there is true judgment
there is no peace? And where there is peace there is no true judgment?
Then what is the true judgment wherein is peace? This can only be
arbitration. And it is written of David: <span
id="fr_56"></span>[3](#fn_56.md) AND DAVID ACTED WITH JUDGMENT AND
CHARITY <span id="fr_57"></span>[4](#fn_57.md) TO ALL HIS PEOPLE. And is it
not the case that wherever there is judgment there is no charity? And
where there is charity there is no judgment? Then what is the judgment
wherein is charity? This can only be arbitration.

4\. When judgment has been given in a case, justifying him who was in
the right, and condemning him who was in the wrong, if it be a poor man
who has been condemned the judge sends him away and gives him support
out of his own pocket. He is thus found acting with judgment to the one
and with charity to the other.

5\. Rabbi says: When judgment has been given in a case, justifying him
who was in the right, and condemning him who was in the wrong, charity
is dealt to him who was in the wrong since what was stolen is taken from
him; and judgment is meted out to him who was in the right, since what
was his is restored to him.

6\. R. Shimeon, <span id="fr_58"></span>[5](#fn_58.md) the son of Menasia,
says: There are certain times when a man may act as arbitrator

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

and other times when he may not. If two men were to come before another
for judgment, and he, before he have heard their words, or even after he
have heard their words, be unable to determine whom the legal verdict
will favour, it is right that he should say to them: Go and arbitrate
between yourselves. But if, when he has heard their words, he knows whom
the legal verdict will favour, it is not right that he should tell them
to go and arbitrate; for it is written: <span
id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59.md) THE BEGINNING OF STRIFE IS AS WHEN ONE
LETTETH OUT WATER; THEREFORE BEFORE THE MATTER IS LAID BARE <span
id="fr_60"></span>[2](#fn_60.md) LEAVE OFF CONTENTION. Before the verdict
is apparent thou art free to abandon the case; afterwards thou art not
free.

7\. R. Jehuda, <span id="fr_61"></span>[3](#fn_61.md) the son of Lakish,
said: If two men, a strong one and a weak one, were to come before
another for judgment, and he, before he have heard their words, or even
after he have heard them, be unable to determine whom the legal verdict
will favour, it is right that he should say to them: I cannot allow
myself to be implicated in your case, lest the weak be found guilty and
the strong persecute him. But if, when he have heard their words, he
knows whom the legal verdict will favour, it is not right that he should
say: I cannot allow myself to be implicated in your case. For it is
written: <span id="fr_62"></span>[4](#fn_62.md) YE SHALL NOT BE AFRAID OF
THE FACE OF MAN, FOR THE JUDGMENT IS GOD'S.

8\. Said R. Jehoshua, the son of Karha: Whence do we know that if a man
were sitting before the judge, and knew that a poor man (though
condemned) was innocent and a rich man (though acquitted) was guilty, he
should not keep silence?

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

Scripture says: LO TAGURU <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md) BECAUSE OF
MAN. That is to say: Ye shall not store up your words because of man.

9\. The judges should know whom they are judging and before whom they
are judging and who He is who is judging with them. And the witnesses
should know against whom they are testifying and with whom they are
testifying and who He is who bears testimony with them, as it is
written: <span id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64.md) THEN BOTH THE MEN BETWEEN
WHOM THE CONTROVERSY IS, SHALL STAND BEFORE THE LORD. And also it is
written: <span id="fr_65"></span>[3](#fn_65.md) GOD STANDS IN THE
CONGREGATION OF GOD, AND IN THE MIDST OF JUDGES <span
id="fr_66"></span>[4](#fn_66.md) HE JUDGES. So again it is said concerning
Jehoshaphat: <span id="fr_67"></span>[5](#fn_67.md) CONSIDER WHAT YE DO,
FOR YE JUDGE NOT FOR MAN BUT FOR GOD. And lest a judge should say, "Why
do I take this trouble?"--has it not been said, <span
id="fr_68"></span>[5](#fn_67.md) HE IS WITH YOU IN THE MATTER OF JUDGMENT?
Thy concern is only with what thine eyes see.

R. Shimeon, the son of Gamaliel, says: As three judges are required for
legal judgment, so three judges are required for arbitration. Greater is
the force of arbitration than that of legal judgment; for if two judges
have given a legal decision the parties are not thereby bound, <span
id="fr_69"></span>[6](#fn_68.md) whereas if arbitration has been effected
by two judges the parties are bound.

II\. 1. The hallowing of the month and the intercalation of the year are
determined by three judges,--so R. Meir; but the majority hold that in
the intercalation of the year the case is begun by three, discussed by
five, and concluded by seven. If one is in favour of considering the
necessity of intercalation

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

<span class="margnote">T.</span>

and two are not, they proceed no further; the single one remains in a
minority. If two are in favour of considering it and one not, two more
are added, and the five discuss the matter. If two say that it is
necessary to intercalate and three not, they proceed no further; the two
remain in a minority. If three say that it is necessary and two not, two
more are added and the matter is decided by the seven; for the body that
effects the decision cannot be less than seven. If a father be in favour
of intercalating and his son not, the two are reckoned as two; if both
father and son are in favour of intercalating or of not intercalating,
the two count as one. Said R. Jose: Once, I and Eleazar, my son, went up
to intercalate the year, and I said to him, My son, you and I will only
count as one.

2\. There are three signs which make it evident that the year should be
intercalated: the premature state of the corn-crops, the undeveloped
state of the tree products, and the lateness of the spring
equinox. <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_69.md) On the basis of any two of
these they may intercalate, but not on one only; though if they were to
intercalate on the basis of one only the intercalation would hold good
If the premature state of the corn-crops be one of the signs, they
rejoice. <span id="fr_71"></span>[2](#fn_70.md) R. Shimeon the son of
Gamaliel says: Also if it be the lateness of the spring equinox.

3\. On the basis of evidence derived from three countries used they to
intercalate the year: Judaea, the land beyond Jordan, and Galilee. They
may intercalate on the basis of two of these, but not of one only;
though in this latter case the intercalation would hold good. And if
Judaea were one of the two they rejoiced, because it was from there that
the offering of the firstfruits came.

4\. The years could not be intercalated owing to

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>the fact that the season of the kids
or lambs or pigeons had not yet arrived; such could only be regarded as
a subsidiary reason for intercalating. But if the intercalation has been
made on the basis of this evidence, the intercalation holds good. 5. R.
Jannai <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_71.md) said in the name of Rabban
Shimeon, the son of Gamaliel: He used to say: "In that the pigeons are
still tender and the spring lambs thin, it is fitting in my opinion to
add thirty days to this year."

6\. It happened once with Rabban Gamaliel <span
id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_72.md) and the elders, that they were sitting on
the steps in the Temple Mount, with Johanan the scribe on the one side
in front of them. They said to him: Write to our brethren of Upper and
Lower Galilee, "May your peace be increased! We make known to you that
the time of removal of produce is arrived, for paying tithes from the
olive vats." And to our brethren of the upper and lower regions of the
South, "May your peace be increased! We make known to you that the time
of removal of produce is arrived, for paying tithes from the sheaves of
corn." And to our brethren, the exiles of Babylon, and those in exile in
Media, and all the other Israelites in exile, "May your peace be
increased! We make known to you that the pigeons are still tender and
the lambs thin, and that the season of spring is not yet come. It seems
fitting to me and to my colleagues that we add to this year thirty
days."

7\. The year is not to be intercalated unless the spring equinox is
still distant the greater part of a month. How much is the greater part
of a month?

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span>

Sixteen days. R. Jehuda says Two thirds of a month, twenty days. R. Jose
says: Account is taken of the year and if, before Passover, there still
lack sixteen days of the equinox, they intercalate another month. They
may not make the intercalation before the Feast of Tabernacles in the
same circumstances; <span id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_73.md) but R. Shimeon
holds that they may. They may not make an intercalation before the New
Year Feast, and if they do it is not valid. But when the need arises
they intercalate immediately after the New Year. And even then they can
only intercalate Adar. <span id="fr_75"></span>[2](#fn_74.md)

8\. They may not intercalate less or more than a month, and if they do
it is not valid. They may not intercalate for a year in advance, and if
they do it is not valid. And they may not intercalate successive years.
R. Shimeon says: They may intercalate successive years; for it happened
with R. Akiba <span id="fr_76"></span>[3](#fn_75.md) that when he was shut
up in prison, he

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

intercalated three years in succession. It was replied: That forms no
proof, because it is for the court alone to sit and calculate each year
at its proper time.

9\. They may not intercalate a Sabbatic year, nor the year that follows.
In such cases it is customary to intercalate the year preceding the
Sabbatic year.

They may not intercalate a year when there is a famine. R. Meir says: It
is written, AND THERE CAME A MAN FROM BAAL-SHALISHA AND BROUGHT THE MAN
OF GOD BREAD OF THE FIRSTFRUITS, TWENTY LOAVES OF BARLEY, AND FRESH EARS
OF CORN IN HIS SACK, <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_76.md) etc. But is it
not true that there is no place where the produce is ready sooner than
at Baal-Shalisha? And even so, he only offered as firstfruits that
species which he brought to the man of God. Perhaps he brought it before
the time of offering the sheaf? Scripture says: AND HE SAID, GIVE IT TO
THE PEOPLE, THAT THEY MAY EAT <span
id="fr_78"></span>[2](#fn_77.md)--showing that he only brought it after
that it was in the sheaf. And was not that year fitted to be
intercalated? <span id="fr_79"></span>[3](#fn_78.md) And why did not Elisha
intercalate it? Because it was a year of famine, and all the people were
running to the threshing floors.

10\. They may not intercalate a year when there is impurity. (But) it
happened with Hezekiah the king that he did intercalate a year when
there was impurity, as it is written: FOR A MULTITUDE OF THE PEOPLE,
EVEN THE MEN OF EPHRAIM AND MANASSEH, ISSACHAR AND ZEBULUN, HAD NOT
CLEANSED THEMSELVES, YET THEY DID EAT THE PASSOVER OTHERWISE THAN IT IS
WRITTEN. FOR HEZEKIAH HAD PRAYED FOR THEM SAYING, THE LORD PARDON EVERY
ONE, <span id="fr_80"></span>[4](#fn_79) etc. 11. (Therefore.md) R. Jehuda
says: They may intercalate a year when there is impurity. R. Shimeon
says: If they do

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

intercalate such a year the intercalation is valid; (and Hezekiah prayed
for mercy <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_80).md) because he had
intercalated Nisan, whereas you may intercalate Adar only. R.
Shimeon, <span id="fr_82"></span>[2](#fn_81.md) the son of Jehuda, said in
the name of R. Shimeon: Also because he caused the congregation to
celebrate a second Passover. <span id="fr_83"></span>[3](#fn_82.md)

12\. They may not intercalate a year except when it is necessary; but
they may intercalate because of real cases of need, <span
id="fr_84"></span>[4](#fn_83.md) because of ovens <span
id="fr_85"></span>[5](#fn_84.md) and because of the exiles <span
id="fr_86"></span>[6](#fn_85.md) who have left their homes. They may not
intercalate the year because of cold, or of snows, or for the sake of
any exiles who have not gone forth from their homes. All these are
considered as subsidiary reasons; yet if the intercalation has been made
on the basis of these, the intercalation holds good.

13\. They may not intercalate except in Judaea, but if they do so
elsewhere the intercalation holds good. Hanania <span
id="fr_87"></span>[7](#fn_86.md) of Ono testified before Rabban Gamaliel
that they intercalated the year in Judaea only, though if they
intercalated it in Galilee it was valid. <span
id="fr_88"></span>[8](#fn_87.md)

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

<span class="margnote">T.</span>

They can intercalate the year any time during the First Adar. To this it
was replied: It may only be intercalated before the date of the Feast of
Purim. <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_88.md) But R. Jehoshua <span
id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_89.md) and R. Papias came and testified that it
is legitimate to intercalate throughout the whole of Adar.

Rabban Shimeon, the son of Gamaliel, and R. Eleazar, <span
id="fr_91"></span>[3](#fn_90.md) the son of Zadok, said: They may not
intercalate the year nor decide on the needs of the congregation except
by arrangement, in order that the wishes of the congregation may be
consulted. 14. They may not intercalate the year by night, and if they
do so it is not valid. Nor may they carry out the hallowing of the month
by night; and if they do so it is not valid.

A king cannot sit in the Sanhedrin, and neither a king nor a high-priest
can take part in the debate on the intercalation of the year.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_14"></span>[23:1](tsa03.htm#fr_14.md) Lit. "cases of money, or
property"; while "capital-cases" is lit. "cases of souls, or lives." The
distinction is not between charges relating to damage to property and
offences against persons, but between charges which, if the prisoner be
found guilty, can be atoned for by the forfeiture of money, and those
which can be atoned for only by the forfeiture of the prisoner's own
life.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[23:8](tsa03.htm#fr_21.md) The specific instance
given in Deut. 22. 13 ff. is meant. If the charge is not justified the
accuser is fined a hundred pieces of silver; but if the woman is guilty
she is to he stoned. Therefore it is a capital charge, and as such must
be tried before twenty-three judges.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[23:9](tsa03.htm#fr_22.md) R. Meir, flourished
130-160 A.D., was R. Akiba's most famous disciple, and one of the
greatest figures in Jewish literature. He carried on Akiba's labours in
the codifying of the Mishnah, and his material provided the basis for
the final form which it took under the hands of Rabbi Jehuda ha-Nasi. He
was *Hakam*, "advising <span id="page_24">p. 24</span> sage" or
"speaker" (see note on *T*. vii. 7) to the Sanhedrin at Usha under
Rabban Shimeon b. Gamaliel II. So great was his reputation that he
refused to submit to the ceremonial introduced by Rabban Shimeon to
parade the dignity of the office of Patriarch (the ceremony was that
described in *T*. vii. 8), and retired to Asia Minor.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[24:1](tsa03.htm#fr_23.md) Lit. "the wise."
Anonymous opinions represent those of the teachers in general, and after
the demurrer of a single teacher they are normally introduced by the
formula, "the words of the wise" or " the sages say."

<span id="fn_24"></span>[24:2](tsa03.htm#fr_24.md) Deut. 25. 1-3. Cf. Deut.
22. 13 ff.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[24:3](tsa03.htm#fr_25.md) Bomberg text adds:
"*According to R. Ishmael, by twenty-three*." For the argument which is
adduced in favour of this number, see *T*. vii. 4.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[24:4](tsa03.htm#fr_26.md) The normal expression
(see *T*. ii. I) is "hallowing of the month," *i.e.* the official
recognition of the appearance of the New Moon, to ensure the exact time
of observance of the important festivals, whose date is fixed from the
time of the New Moon.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[24:5](tsa03.htm#fr_27.md) The Jewish months are
still lunar months, twelve of which only total 354 days, 8 hours, or
nearly 11 days short of the solar year. This necessitates the insertion
of another month at least every third year. This intercalary month of 30
days--called Adar Sheni, or Ve-Adar, "Second Adar," is inserted between
Adar and Nisan.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[24:6](tsa03.htm#fr_28.md) Son and successor of
Gamaliel II to the Patriarchate of the Jews, and father of Rabbi Jehuda

<span id="fn_31"></span>[25:1](tsa03.htm#fr_31.md) The usual form of
reference to R. Shimeon ben Jochai. He was one of the five most famous
disciples of R. Akiba, and became a member of the Sanhedrin at Usha. R.
Jehuda ha-Nasi himself was one of his pupils at the school which he set
up at Meron (or Teko‘a.) In his old age he carried out, with R. Eleazar
b. Jose, a successful embassy to Rome on behalf of the Jews.

was another famous disciple of R. Akiba, and a follower of his
exegetical methods. He is supposed to be largely responsible for
*Sifra*, the commentary on Leviticus.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[25:3](tsa03.htm#fr_33.md) Lit. "the drawing off"
*scil*. of the shoe. See Deut. 25. 5-10.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[25:4](tsa03.htm#fr_34.md) If a woman during her
minority have been given in marriage she may, on the attainment of her
majority, refuse her consent to the union if her father was not among
those who agreed to the contract. See *M. Yeb*. 13. I.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[25:5](tsa03.htm#fr_35.md) Lev. 19. 23-25.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[25:6](tsa03.htm#fr_36.md) Deut. 14. 22-26.
Rabbinical interpretation recognized three tithes: the First or Levitic
tithe, Num. 18. 21; the Second tithe, which the owner must consume in
Jerusalem, Deut. 14. 22 ff.; and Tithe for the Poor, Deut. 14. 28 ff.;
26. 12. The Second tithe need not be conveyed to Jerusalem in kind, but
might be converted into money (and reconverted at Jerusalem), Deut. 22.
26. A "Board of assessment" is here provided by the *Mishnah* for
valuing the Second tithe before it is converted into money.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[25:7](tsa03.htm#fr_37.md) This and the rest of the
paragraph refer to Lev. 27.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[25:8](tsa03.htm#fr_38.md) The customary
abbreviation employed to allude to R. Jehuda ha-Nasi. He was grandson of
Rabban Gamaliel II, and ultimately succeeded him as *Nasi*, "Prince," of
the Jewish community, and seems to have been not the least distinguished
of a very distinguished family. His chief title to fame rests on his
compiling an authoritative form out of the several *Mishnah* collections
which <span id="page_26">p. 26</span> were then in existence. Our
present Mishnah is accepted as being in all essentials identical with
that drawn up by Rabbi.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[26:1](tsa03.htm#fr_39.md) Ordination to the
position of judge or teacher.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[26:2](tsa03.htm#fr_40.md) Deut. 15. 21.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[26:3](tsa03.htm#fr_41.md) R. Jose ben Halafta,
*c*. 150-280 A.D., was another of R. Akiba's more famous disciples, as
well as a supporter of his master's methods of interpretation.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[26:4](tsa03.htm#fr_42.md) Another pupil of R.
Akiba. He had a great reputation as a Haggadist, and the present passage
is an instance of his use of the method in the stricter sphere of
*Halaka*. He laid down a list of thirty-two rules, by which the
interpretation of the Bible should be governed.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[26:5](tsa03.htm#fr_43.md) A frequent
circumlocution for God, emphasizing the idea of His unique existence and
omnipresence.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[27:1](tsa03.htm#fr_44.md) Ps. 10. 3. Prayer Book
Version: "And speaketh good of the *covetous*, whom God abhorreth." The
root meaning of the word is "to cut;" used metaphorically in O. T. "to
get unjust gain," hence "to act in a covetous manner." In Mishnaic
Hebrew = "Cut, split the difference," and so "arbitrate."

<span id="fn_45"></span>[27:2](tsa03.htm#fr_45.md) That is, there must be
no amendments once a decision has been given by a legally constituted
court.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[27:3](tsa03.htm#fr_46.md) Mal. 2. 6.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[27:4](tsa03.htm#fr_47.md) A younger disciple of R.
Akiba. He survived the Hadrianic persecutions, and became a member of
the Sanhedrin which was afterwards set up at Usha.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[27:5](tsa03.htm#fr_48.md) R. Eleazar interprets
the words as meaning: "If a robber has blessed, he," etc.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[27:6](tsa03.htm#fr_49.md) The third of an Ephah,
or equivalent in modern measure to one and a half pecks.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[27:7](tsa03.htm#fr_50.md) The small cake set apart
in fulfilment Pf the injunction in Num. 15. 20-2I.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[27:8](tsa03.htm#fr_51.md) Adopting the meaning
current in O. T.; cf. Pr. 1. 19; 15. 27; Jer. 6. 13; 8. 10; Hab. 2. 9.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[27:9](tsa03.htm#fr_52.md) This explanation turns
on the meaning "one who gets illegal profit;" *beṣa* = gain wrongly
acquired.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[27:10](tsa03.htm#fr_53.md) Gen. 37. 26,

<span id="fn_54"></span>[28:1](tsa03.htm#fr_54.md) *c*. 150 A.D. He is said
to have been the son of R. Akiba, though this is questioned.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[28:2](tsa03.htm#fr_55.md) Zech. 8. 16.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[28:3](tsa03.htm#fr_56.md) Sam. 8. 15.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[28:4](tsa03.htm#fr_57.md) Heb. *Ṣedāḳā*, R.V.
"Justice"; but here given a meaning which it later acquired.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[28:5](tsa03.htm#fr_58.md) An elder contemporary of
R. Jehuda ha-Nasi. One of his sayings is (*Tos. Yadaim* II. 14):
"Canticles was inspired by the Holy Ghost, while Ecclesiastes expresses
merely the wisdom of Solomon."

<span id="fn_59"></span>[29:1](tsa03.htm#fr_59.md) Prov. 17. 14.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[29:2](tsa03.htm#fr_60.md) So Targum. R. V. "
before there be quarrelling."

<span id="fn_61"></span>[29:3](tsa03.htm#fr_61.md) A teacher who lived at
the beginning of the second century. Little is known of him, and his
name only appears in *Tosefta* and *Mekilta*.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[29:4](tsa03.htm#fr_62.md) Deut. 1. 17.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[30:1](tsa03.htm#fr_63.md) A play of words on *lo
taguru*, ''thou shalt not fear," and *lo te’egoru*, from a root meaning
"gather, collect."

<span id="fn_64"></span>[30:2](tsa03.htm#fr_64.md) Deut. 19. I7.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[30:3](tsa03.htm#fr_65.md) Ps. 82. 1.

6, R. V. and R. V. mg.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[30:5](tsa03.htm#fr_68.md) 2. Ch. 19. 6.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[30:6](tsa03.htm#fr_69.md) See *M*. iii. 6 *b*,
from which it is to be inferred that the judgment decreed by two judges
only is not valid.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[31:1](tsa03.htm#fr_70.md) March 21st, according to
our reckoning.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[31:2](tsa03.htm#fr_71.md) Because the year is
intercalated and a longer period granted for the ripening of the crops.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[32:1](tsa03.htm#fr_72.md) *c*. 200 A.D. One of the
first generation of the *Anoraim*, the scholars who, from the
commencement of the third century, began to comment on the text of the
*Mishnah*.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[32:2](tsa03.htm#fr_73.md) Rabban Gamaliel I, the
Gamaliel of Acts 5. 34. Though he is here, according to the tannaitic
tradition, holding a position not less than that held by Rabban Gamaliel
II, or R. Jehuda ha-Nasi, the New Testament sees in him no more than "a
Pharisee . . . a doctor of the law, had in honour of the people."

<span id="fn_73"></span>[33:1](tsa03.htm#fr_74.md) That is, they may not
fix the Feast of Tabernacles (15th-21st of Tishri; Sept.–Oct.) on the
basis of the autumn equinox (our Sept. 22).

<span id="fn_74"></span>[33:2](tsa03.htm#fr_75.md) *Adar* corresponds
nearly to February and March. The New Year, *Rosh ha-Shana*, commences
with the month *Tishri*, (nearly = our September). For the Jewish
Calendar see Oesterley and Box: *Religion and Worship of the Synagogue*,
pp. 318 ff.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[33:3](tsa03.htm#fr_76.md) R. Akiba was perhaps the
greatest figure in Jewish literature during the early part of the second
century. His teachers were R. Jehoshua b. Hanania and R. Eliezer h.
Hyrcanus; while among his pupils were numbered such men as R. Meir, R.
Jose b. Halafta and R. Shimeon b. Jochai. He was closely connected with
the revolt of Bar Kokba, and met his death at the hands of the Romans.
He is chiefly responsible for the final form which the canon of the Old
Testament has taken, and it was he who began the process of collecting
the mass of oral tradition which was continued by R. Meir and completed
by R. Jehuda ha-Nasi. He was also the initiator of a type of exegesis
which carried the theory of verbal inspiration to its extreme
conclusions: not only every sentence, but every word, every particle,
every letter, and even every peculiar form of a letter was possessed of
a special divine significance, and from every such detail an endless
series of conclusions might be derived, far removed from the mere
literal meaning conveyed by the verse.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[34:1](tsa03.htm#fr_77.md) 2 Kings 4. 42.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[34:2](tsa03.htm#fr_78.md) 2 Kings 4. 43.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[34:3](tsa03.htm#fr_79.md) Because, apparently, of
the lateness of the corn-crops.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[34:4](tsa03.htm#fr_80.md) 2 Chron. 30. 18.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[35:1](tsa03.htm#fr_81.md) This phrase does not
occur in *T*.; but it occurs in the parallel passage in B. 12 *a*, and
is necessary in view of the two following opinions.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[35:2](tsa03.htm#fr_82.md) R. Shimeon b. Jehuda (of
Kefar Akkos or Ikos) is seldom referred to otherwise than as handing
down the dicta of Shimeon b. Jochai, whose younger contemporary he
probably was.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[35:3](tsa03.htm#fr_83.md) Numb. 9. to 10 ff.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[35:4](tsa03.htm#fr_84.md) B. 11 *a* reads
"paths"--*i.e.* when they are impassable for those coming from a
distance to celebrate the Passover at Jerusalem--and also adds
"bridges."

<span id="fn_84"></span>[35:5](tsa03.htm#fr_85.md) That is, the earth ovens
(necessary for roasting the Passover lamb), which had not yet become dry
after the winter rains. For the form of the oven, *tannur*, see
Hastings' *Dictionary of the Bible*, art. "Oven."

<span id="fn_85"></span>[35:6](tsa03.htm#fr_86.md) Jews from a distant part
of the Diaspora, who have already set out on their way to Jerusalem for
the Feast.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[35:7](tsa03.htm#fr_87.md) He was, like most of his
generation, a pupil of R. Akiba. He is chiefly remembered by the feat he
accomplished of obtaining a ruling from Akiba on some disputed point,
although his master was at the time in prison awaiting the death
penalty.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[35:8](tsa03.htm#fr_88.md) B. 11 *b* reporting the
same tradition reads "not valid."

<span id="fn_88"></span>[36:1](tsa03.htm#fr_89.md) Because in an
intercalary year Purim is celebrated not in First, but in Second, Adar.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[36:2](tsa03.htm#fr_90.md) R. Jehoshua ben Hanania,
*c*. 80-130 A.D., was one of the most prominent teachers of his day. He
was a pupil of Jochanan b. Zakkai, and sat in the Jabne Sanhedrin first
under his master, and later under Gamaliel II. He is supposed to have
had a strong restraining influence over the would-be revolters among the
Jews, and not till after his death did they finally break out under Bar
Kokba. Like R. Ishmael b. Shamua, *q.v.*, he favoured the plain meaning
of Scripture, and, on this account, is often represented as in
opposition to R. Akiba.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[36:3](tsa03.htm#fr_91) R. Eleazar (Eliezer.md) b.
Zadok is represented in the rabbinical . writings as a witness of the
sufferings which befell the Jews after the fall of Jerusalem. He later
became a member of the Sanhedrin at Jabne under Gamaliel II.
