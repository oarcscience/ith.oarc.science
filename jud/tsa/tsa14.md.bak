### The Method of Legal Procedure in Capital Cases.

V. I. Witnesses were examined by seven queries: In what Sabbatic period?
In what year? In what month? On what day of the month? On what day? At
what hour? and, Where? According to R. Jose the queries were: On what
day? At what hour? Where? Do you recognize him? Did you warn him? And,
in the case of idolatry, they were asked, What idol was
worshipped? <span id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_259.md) and, How was it
worshipped?

2\. The judge who cross-examines at great length is deserving of praise.
Ben Zakkai <span id="fr_263"></span>[3](#fn_260.md) once carried his
cross-examination into details about fig-stalks!

What is the difference between "queries" and "cross-examination"? If,
during the queries, one answered, "I do not know," <span
id="fr_264"></span>[4](#fn_261.md) the testimony of the witnesses is
worthless; but if, in cross-examination, one say, "I do not know," or if
two say, "We do not <span id="fr_265"></span>[5](#fn_262.md) know," their
evidence holds good. Yet

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>in either case where they contradict
each other's evidence, their evidence is worthless.

**T**. IX. 1 *a*. R. Shimeon, the son of Eleazar, says: "They take the
witness from place to place so that his mind may become confused."

R. Jose says: "The judges need not ask in what Sabbatic period? In what
month? On what day of the month? but only, On what day? At what hour? In
what place? Do you recognize him? Did you warn him? With what did he
kill him? Did he kill him with a sword? Did he kill him with a stick?
Did he strike him on the leg? Did he strike him intentionally on 'the
bird of life'? <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_263.md) In what direction
was he looking when he killed him?" <span
id="fr_267"></span>[2](#fn_264.md)

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>V. 3. If one say "on the second of
the month" and another "on the third," their evidence holds good, since
one and not the other may have known of an intercalation of the month.
If one say "at the second hour" and the other "at the third," their
evidence is valid. If one say "at the third hour" and the other "at the
fifth," their evidence is invalid. R. Jehuda, however, maintains that it
is valid; though if one say "at the fifth hour" and the other "at the
seventh," their evidence is invalid, since at the fifth hour the sun is
in the east, and at the seventh it is in the west.

**T**. IX. 1 *b*. If one say "on the second of the month" and another
"on the third," their evidence is valid because all may not be aware of
an intercalation of the month. If one say "at the second hour"

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

and the other "at the third," their evidence is valid because all may
not know the exact hour. If one say "at the third hour" and the other
"at the fifth," their evidence is invalid. R. Jehuda, however, says: "In
that case their evidence is valid; though if one say 'at the fifth hour'
and the other 'at the seventh,' their evidence is invalid, for all must
know that at the fifth hour the sun is in the east, and at the seventh
in the west."

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>V. 4. The second witness was also
brought in and examined. If their testimony is found to agree, they open
the case for the defence. If one of the witnesses say "I have something
to plead in favour of his acquittal," or if one of the disciples say, "I
have something to plead in favour of his conviction," he is silenced.
But if a disciple say, "I have something to plead in favour of his
acquittal," he is brought up and given a place with the judges, where he
remains all day. If there is reason in his plea he is listened to. Even
if the accused say that he has something to plead in his own defence he
is listened to, but only if his words are reasonable.

B. IX. 1 *c*. If the evidence of the witnesses is found to agree, the
chief judge opens the case for the defendant, and his fellow judges
support him.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>V. 5 *a*. If the accused is found
innocent he is set free; if not, his case is passed over till the
morrow. The judges then go apart in pairs and take some food, but they
drink no wine the whole day. They spend the night discussing the case
and come to the court early on the morrow. He who is in favour of
acquittal says, "I acquitted yesterday

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>and I still acquit," and he who is
in favour of conviction says, "I convicted yesterday and still convict."
He who had previously urged conviction may now acquit, but he who had
previously urged acquittal cannot now turn and urge conviction. If any
err in this matter the judges' clerks must remind them.

**T**. IX. 1 *d*. If they have found for the defendant they set him
free; if not, his case is passed over till the morrow. The judges then
go apart in pairs and take food--but they drink no wine--and discuss all
night the section of Scripture bearing on the case: if it was a case of
murder, they discuss the section dealing with murder; <span
id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_265.md) if a case of incest, they discuss the
section dealing with incest. <span id="fr_269"></span>[2](#fn_266.md) On
the morrow they come early to the court, and the officers call on each
judge to give his verdict. If one answer, "I acquitted yesterday and
still acquit," his decision is accepted; if he say, "I acquitted
yesterday, but now I convict," such a decision is not accepted. If he
say, "I convicted yesterday, but now I acquit," his decision is
accepted; if he say, "I convicted yesterday and I still convict," they
say to him, "Study thy words anew." If one of those who now acquit have
changed his former opinion the judges’ scribes remind him of what he
said before; but if one of those who now convict have changed his former
opinions they do not remind him, but say to him, "Study thy words anew."

V. 5 *b*. If acquitted (by all the judges) the accused M. is set free;
if not, the matter is decided by vote. If twelve acquit and eleven
convict, he is to be acquitted; if twelve convict and eleven
acquit, <span id="fr_270"></span>[3](#fn_267.md) or

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>if even twenty-two acquit or convict
while the remaining one declares himself in doubt, the number of judges
is increased. To what extent are they increased? Two by two until
seventy-one is reached. If thirty-six acquit and thirty-five convict, he
is to be acquitted; if thirty-six convict and thirty-five acquit, <span
id="fr_271"></span>[1](#fn_268.md) the case is tried over among themselves
until one of those who convict agrees with those who acquit.

**T**. IX. 2. If they find for the defendant, they set him free; if not,
the matter is decided by vote. If thirty-six acquit and thirty-five
convict, he is acquitted. If thirty-six convict and thirty-five acquit,
they try the case over among themselves until one of those who convict
say, "I agree with those who acquit."

3\. If one of the disciples say, "I have something to plead on behalf of
the defendant," the judges accept him in a friendly way and bring him up
and seat him with them. If there be reason in his plea they include him
as a judge, and he remains with them always; and if not, he still
remains with them the whole of that day, so that his rise should not be
his fall.

4\. If one say, "I have something to plead on behalf of the defendant,"
they listen to him; but if it be against the interests of the defendant,
they silence him with a rebuke.

A witness cannot plead either for or against the defendant; but R. Jose,
the son of R. Jehuda, says that he may plead for, but not against, the
defendant.

If twelve acquit and eleven convict, he is acquitted; if twelve convict
and eleven acquit, they

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

add to the number of judges until they persuade one to acquit or two to
convict.

R. Jose said, "If any one of the judges retract they vote anew, it may
be once, twice, or three times; and whether or not there is reason in
his words, they listen to him. Beyond this, they listen only if his
words be reasonable; otherwise, they do not listen."
