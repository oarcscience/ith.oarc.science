### Cases which must be tried by the Lesser Sanhedrin.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>I. 4. Capital cases are to be tried
by twenty-three judges:--The two parties in an unnatural crime, by
twenty-three, as it is written: <span id="fr_92"></span>[4](#fn_91.md) AND

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span><span class="contnote">\[paragraph

also: <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_92.md) AND THE BEAST YE SHALL SLAY;
the ox subject to the penalty of stoning, <span
id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_93.md) by twenty-three, as it is written: <span
id="fr_95"></span>[3](#fn_94.md) THE OX SHALL BE STONED AND ITS MASTER ALSO
SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH, master and ox suffer the like death; the
lion, <span id="fr_96"></span>[4](#fn_95.md) the bear, the leopard, the
panther and the serpent, <span id="fr_97"></span>[5](#fn_96.md) their death
is to be determined by twenty-three. R. Eleazar <span
id="fr_98"></span>[6](#fn_97.md) holds that it would be right for any one
to put them to death at once (without trial), but R. Akiba maintains
that their death is to he determined by twenty-three judges.

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

III\. 1. If an ox have caused death--and it is all one whether it be an
ox or any other beast or living creature or bird that has caused
death--its death is at the hands of twenty-three judges. R. Eleazar
says: If an ox have caused death, its death is at the hands of
twenty-three judges; but in the case of the rest of beasts and living
creatures and birds, any one who kills them before trial acquires merit
in the sight of Heaven. For it is written: AND THOU SHALT SLAY THE WOMAN
AND THE BEAST; and again: THE BEAST YE SHALL SLAY.

2\. The ox subject to the penalty of stoning is to be tried by
twenty-three, for it is written: THE OX SHALL BE STONED AND ITS MASTER
ALSO SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH; as is the death of the master, so is the
death of the ox. As the death of the master is by stoning and being
thrown down and at the hands of twenty-three judges, so the death

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

of the ox is by stoning and being thrown down and at the hands of
twenty-three judges. <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_98.md)

3\. What is the difference between the trial of the ox and the trial of
the man? In the case of the ox they may begin the case on one day and
finish the same night; or begin and finish the case during the same day,
no matter whether they are arriving at a verdict of innocent or guilty;
they may decide by a majority of one whether for conviction or
acquittal; all may argue in favour either of conviction or acquittal;
and he who had urged acquittal may change and urge conviction. <span
id="fr_100"></span>[2](#fn_99.md) But in the case of the man, all such
procedure is illegal.
