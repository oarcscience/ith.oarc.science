### Those who may be killed untried.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VIII. 7. These may be saved (from
sin) at the cost of their lives: <span id="fr_370"></span>[1](#fn_366.md)
he who pursues after his fellow to kill him, or after a male, or after a
betrothed damsel. But he who pursues after a beast, or he who defiles
the Sabbath, or he who commits idolatry, may not be saved (from sin) at
the cost of his life.

**T**. XI. 10. He who pursues after his fellow (to kill him) may be
saved (from sin) at the cost of his life. How do they do this? They
wound one of his limbs; and if even so they cannot prevent him, they
forthwith kill him.

11\. He who pursues after a male, whether it be in a house or the open
field, may be saved (from sin) at the cost of his life; if it be after a
betrothed damsel, whether in a house or the open field, he may be so
killed. If it be a betrothed damsel or any of the prohibited degrees
enjoined in the Law, he may be so killed; but if it be a divorced widow
of a high-priest, or an ordinary priest's wife who had been subjected to
the *ḥaliṣa* ceremony, he may not be saved (from sin) at the cost of his
life. R. Jehuda says: Also, should she say, "Let him alone!" he may not
be so killed, even though by leaving him alone he commit a capital
crime.

R. Eleazar, the son of R. Zadok, says: He who commits idolatry may be
saved (from sin) at the cost of his life.
