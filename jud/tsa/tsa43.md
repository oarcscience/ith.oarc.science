### (4) The False Prophet.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>XI. 5. " The false prophet " <span
id="fr_495"></span>[5](#fn_488) is he who prophesies what he has not
heard, and what was not told

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

<span class="margnote">M.</span>him; <span
id="fr_496"></span>[1](#fn_489) whereas he who suppresses his prophetic
message, or regards as exaggerated the words of another prophet, or
transgresses his own words, his death is left in the hands of Heaven, as
it is written: I WILL REQUIRE IT OF HIM. <span
id="fr_497"></span>[2](#fn_490)

**T**. XIV. 13. He who prophesies in order to abrogate anything of what
is written in the Law, is guilty. R. Shimeon says: If he prophesy in
such a way as partly to abrogate and partly to support, he is free from
penalty. If he have prophesied in the name of an idol, even if he
maintain it one day and withdraw it another, he is guilty.

He who prophesies what he has not heard, like Zedekiah the son of
Chenaanah <span id="fr_498"></span>[3](#fn_491); or prophesies what has
not been told him, like Hananiah the son of Azzur <span
id="fr_499"></span>[4](#fn_492)--who heard what Jeremiah the prophet was
prophesying in the upper street and went and prophesied otherwise in the
lower street; or suppresses his prophetic message, like Jonah, the son
of Amittai <span id="fr_500"></span>[5](#fn_493); or regards a prophetic
message as exaggerated, like the companion of Micah <span
id="fr_501"></span>[6](#fn_494); or transgresses his own words like
Iddo <span id="fr_502"></span>[7](#fn_495); or changes his prophecy; or
a stranger who ministers in the Temple; or a priest who ministers before
he is fully cleansed, <span id="fr_503"></span>[8](#fn_496) or before he
has made the atonement offering after his cleansing, or who ministers
without the proper garments, or with hands and feet unwashed, or with
hair unkempt, or after having

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

drunk wine: all of these are to die. By what means are they to die? At
the hands of Heaven.
