### Cases which must be tried by the Greater Sanhedrin.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>I. 5. A tribe, a false prophet, or a
high-priest can only be tried by a court of seventy-one judges; an
aggressive war can only be waged by the authority of a court of
seventy-one; an addition to the City or to the Temple court-yards <span
id="fr_101"></span>[3](#fn_100.md) can only be carried out by the authority
of a court of seventy-one; the institution of separate tribal Sanhedrins
can only be carried out by the authority of a court of seventy-one; and
the condemnation of a beguiled city <span
id="fr_102"></span>[4](#fn_101.md) can only be effected by the authority of
a court of seventy-one. A frontier town should not be condemned, <span
id="fr_103"></span>[5](#fn_102) nor three (at the same time.md), but only
one or two.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

T. III. 4. They may not burn the red heifer <span
id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_103.md)nor "break the heifer's neck" <span
id="fr_105"></span>[2](#fn_104.md) nor pronounce sentence on an elder who
defies the court, <span id="fr_106"></span>[3](#fn_105.md) nor decide in
the case of "the ox of communal forgetfulness," <span
id="fr_107"></span>[4](#fn_106.md) nor may they appoint a king or
high-priest, except by permission of a court of seventy-one judges.

How do they carry out an alteration (in the city and Temple courtyards)?
The court issues forth and the two thank-offerings <span
id="fr_108"></span>[5](#fn_107.md) behind them; of these offerings the
inner one (nearest the members of the court) is eaten, and the other
burnt. If anything of this is not completed, those who enter there are
not thereby guilty. <span id="fr_109"></span>[6](#fn_108.md) The two
thank-offerings, it has been taught, <span
id="fr_110"></span>[7](#fn_109.md) means their bread offerings, and not
their flesh offerings.

Abba Shaul <span id="fr_111"></span>[8](#fn_110.md) said: There were two
valleys in Jerusalem, a lower one and an upper one. The lower one was
consecrated by all these methods, but the upper was not consecrated
until the members of the Exile returned to Jerusalem, when they were
without king and without Urim and without Tummim. <span
id="fr_112"></span>[9](#fn_111.md) In the lower valley whose consecration
was complete, the common people used to eat the lesser holy
things, <span id="fr_113"></span>[10](#fn_112.md) but not the

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

Second tithe; whereas the more learned used to eat both. In the upper
valley, whose consecration was not complete, the common people used to
eat the lesser holy things, but not the Second tithe; whereas the more
learned used to eat neither. Why had not the upper valley been
consecrated? Because it was a weak part of Jerusalem, and could easily
be captured.

5\. R. Jose said three things in the name of three elders:--R. Akiba
said: Could a man bring up the firstborn of beasts to Jerusalem from
outside of the land of Israel? Scripture says: AND THOU SHALT EAT BEFORE
THE LORD THY GOD THE TITHE OF THY CORN AND WINE AND OIL, AND THE
FIRSTBORN OF BEASTS. <span id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_113.md) That is to
say, from the place whence thou bringest the tithe of corn, thou
bringest the firstborn of beasts; since thou canst not bring the tithe
of corn from outside the land of Israel, neither canst thou bring the
firstborn of beasts from outside the land of Israel.

Shimeon, <span id="fr_115"></span>[2](#fn_114.md) the son of Zoma said: May
it not be that as the Law distinguishes between the most holy things and
lesser holy things, so also it makes a distinction between the firstborn
of beasts and the Second tithe? The customary argument (which proves
that there is no difference between the two) is: Since they must both be
brought to the temple, therefore they must both be consumed within its
walls. (But the analogy is not complete), for the time of the eating of
the firstborn of beasts is limited, hence the place of its eating is
likewise limited; whereas the time of eating of the Second tithe is not
limited. Therefore, since the time of its eating is not limited, neither
can the place of its eating

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

be limited (to within the temple walls). Scripture says: AND THOU SHALT
EAT BEFORE THE LORD THY GOD THE TITHE OF THY CORN AND WINE AND OIL, AND
THE FIRSTBORN OF BEASTS. Therefore since the firstborn of beasts is only
eaten within the temple walls, so the Second tithe is only eaten within
the Temple walls.

6\. R. Ishmael <span id="fr_116"></span>[1](#fn_115.md) says: Ought a man
to bring up the Second tithe to Jerusalem at this time <span
id="fr_117"></span>[2](#fn_116.md) and eat it? The customary argument would
be: Since the firstborn of beasts must be brought to the temple and the
Second tithe must be brought to the temple, therefore as the firstborn
of beasts is only consumed within the temple, so the Second tithe can
only be consumed within the temple. (But the analogy is not complete),
for not as thou dost argue in the case of the firstborn of beasts--where
there are sprinklings of blood and sacrificial portions laid on the
altar--canst thou argue in the case of the Second tithe, where there are
no sprinklings and no sacrificial portions. Should the case of the
offering of firstfruits be brought forward as an argument, in which are
no sprinklings and no sacrificial portions, and which may only be
consumed within the temple, (it can be answered that the analogy here is
not complete,) for not as thou dost argue in the case of the firstfruits
which must be laid before the altar, canst thou argue in the case of the
Second tithe which is not to be laid before the altar. (But such a
distinction cannot be drawn, for) Scripture says: AND THOU SHALT EAT
BEFORE THE LORD THY GOD THE TITHE OF THY CORN AND WINE AND

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> OIL, AND THE
FIRSTBORN OF BEASTS. As the first- born of beasts is only eaten within
the temple, so the Second tithe can only be eaten within the temple.

Others say: May it not be with the firstborn, that after the first year
has elapsed it becomes like unfit offerings, and so unfit to be brought
up to Jerusalem? Scripture says: THOU SHALT EAT BEFORE THE LORD THY GOD
THE TITHE OF THY CORN AND WINE AND OIL, AND THE FIRSTBORN, etc. If this
were intended to teach that the firstborn can only be consumed within
the temple, it would be superfluous, since it has already been
said: <span id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_117.md) BEFORE THE LORD THY GOD THOU
SHALT EAT IT YEAR BY YEAR. Or if it were intended to teach that the
Second tithe can only be consumed within the temple, it would be
superfluous, since it has already been said: <span
id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_118.md) THOU SHALT NOT BE ABLE TO CONSUME IT
WITHIN THY GATES. Then why does it say, THE TITHE OF THY CORN AND WINE
AND OIL, AND THE FIRSTBORN? It compares the firstborn with the Second
tithe: as the Second tithe must be consumed from year to year to year,
so the firstborn must be consumed from year to year. <span

<span id="fn_108"></span>[39:6](tsa05.htm#fr_109.md) If the consecration is
not complete, those who enter cannot be said to trespass against holy
things.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[39:7](tsa05.htm#fr_110.md) For this, an
interpretation based on Neh. 12. 31, see Sheb. 15 *a*.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[39:8](tsa05.htm#fr_111.md) Is thought to have
been a pupil of R. Akiba. He was a student of the old methods of Temple
worship, and compiled a number of traditions which, differing from the
accepted views, are sometimes quoted in the later collections. Cf. *T*.
xii. 7, 8, 10.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[39:9](tsa05.htm#fr_112.md) Which, together with
prophet and Sanhedrin of Seventy-one members were necessary for valid
consecration; see *Sheb*. 2. 1.

sacrifices of lesser holiness, see Zebachim 5. 6. The reading of *B.
Sheb*. 16 *a*, is here adopted. Text of *T*. is confused. Zuck. reads
"In the lower one . . . the common <span id="page_40">p. 40</span>
people used to eat the lesser holy things, and the more learned the
lesser holy things but not the Second tithe."

<span id="fn_115"></span>[41:1](tsa05.htm#fr_116.md) R. Ishmael (ben
Elisha), lived at the end of the first and the beginning of the second
century. His chief title to fame rests on his "Thirteen Rules of
Interpretation," based on the seven rules drawn up by Hillel (see *T*.
vii. 11.). His method is less mechanical than that of R. Akiba, placing
greater stress on the simple meaning of a passage rather than on verbal
peculiarities. He held that "the Law is written in everyday language."

<span id="fn_116"></span>[41:2](tsa05.htm#fr_117.md) When no temple exists
in which to consume the offerings.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[42:1](tsa05.htm#fr_118.md) Deut. 15. 20.

become invalid after the first year.
