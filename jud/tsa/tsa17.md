### The other Forms of Death Penalty: Burning, Decapitation, and Strangulation.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VII. 1. The court had the power of
inflicting four kinds of death penalty: stoning, burning, decapitation,
and strangulation. R. Shimeon gives them in the order: <span
id="fr_289"></span>[3](#fn_286.md) burning, stoning, strangulation, and
decapitation. The regulations for those to be stoned have already been
given.

**T**. IX. 10. The court had the power of inflicting four kinds of death
penalty, whereas the civil authority <span
id="fr_290"></span>[4](#fn_287.md) can only inflict the penalty of the
sword.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VII. 2. The regulations for those to
be burnt: the criminal is placed in dung up to his knees, and round his
neck is arranged a wrap of coarse

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>material enclosed within one of
soft; the ends of the wrap are pulled on both sides until the criminal
opens his mouth; a thin bar of lead is heated and tossed into his mouth,
and this goes down to his stomach and inflames his entrails.

R. Jehuda says: Even if he die so in their hands, they have not yet
carried out the regulations of burning: they must open his mouth with
forceps against his will, <span id="fr_291"></span>[1](#fn_288.md) heat the
leaden bar, and toss it into his mouth; this goes down to his stomach
and inflames his entrails.

R. Eleazar, the son of Zadok, said: It happened in the case of a
priest's daughter <span id="fr_292"></span>[2](#fn_289.md) who had
committed adultery, that she was surrounded with faggots and in that
manner burnt. But it was replied: The court at that time did not possess
accurate knowledge.

**T**. IX. 11 *a*. Said R. Eleazar, the son of R. Zadok: When I was a
child I was once carried on my father's shoulder to see a priest's
daughter who had committed adultery; they surrounded her with faggots
and so burnt her. They replied: Thou wast a child, and a child cannot
give evidence.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VII. 3*a*. The regulations for those
to be decapitated: their heads are cut off with a sword after the usage
of the (Roman) Empire.

R. Jehuda said: Such a death is too shameful; on the contrary, a man's
head is placed on the block and cut off with an axe. But it was replied:
There is no death more shameful than this.

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

**T**. IX. 11 *b*. R. Jehuda said: Behold it is written: AND THOU SHALT
LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR AS THYSELF, <span id="fr_293"></span>[1](#fn_290.md)
therefore one must choose for him a seemly death. And how do we do this
for him? His bead is placed on an executioner's block and chopped off
with a hatchet.

To this it was replied: There is no death more disgraceful than this;
moreover such should not be done since it is written: IN THEIR
ORDINANCES YE SHALL NOT WALK. <span id="fr_294"></span>[2](#fn_291.md)

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VII. 3*b*. The regulations for those
to be strangled: <span id="fr_295"></span>[3](#fn_292.md) the criminal is
placed in dung up to his knees; and round his neck is arranged a wrap of
coarse material enclosed within one of soft; the ends of the scarf are
pulled on both sides until life is extinct.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_286"></span>[93:3](tsa17.htm#fr_289.md) In descending order of
severity.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[93:4](tsa17.htm#fr_290.md) *Decollatio* was not
the only death penalty in use at the time in the Roman Empire: see *Tac.
Ann*. ii. 32; Suetonius, *Nero* 49, *Claud*. 34.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[94:1](tsa17.htm#fr_291.md) R. Jehuda's amendment
is to avoid the possibility of death taking place by strangulation.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[94:2](tsa17.htm#fr_292.md) Lev. 21. 9.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[95:1](tsa17.htm#fr_293.md) Lev. 19. 18.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[95:2](tsa17.htm#fr_294.md) Lev. 18. 3. But
according to the *Mishnah* already quoted the correct method was "after
the usage of the Roman Empire." In the Cod. Vienna and Venice ed. the
difficulty is partly avoided by the reading, "He (R. Jehuda) said to
them: And though there be no more disgraceful death, still it is written
'And in their ordinances, etc.'"

<span id="fn_292"></span>[95:3](tsa17.htm#fr_295.md) This Rabbinic penalty
is applied mentioned those criminals for the decreed in the Pentateuch
without specifying the mode of death. In regard to these it is argued
(B. 52*b*, 53*a*) that since the Law must not be construed with
severity, the most lenient form of death, a. e. strangulation, must be
applied. Another line of argument is: Sometimes "death at the hands of
Heaven" is ordained (Gen. 38. 7, 10; Lev. 10. 7, 9); and as death from
Heaven leaves no visible marks, so must the death inflicted by the
tribunal leave no mark. And such is only possible by death from
strangulation.
