### 10-11. The Ba‘al ‘Ob and the Yidd‘oni.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VII. 7b. The Ba‘al ‘Ob, <span
id="fr_315"></span>[1](#fn_312.md) that is, the Python <span
id="fr_316"></span>[2](#fn_313.md) who speaks from his armpits, and the
Yidd‘oni <span id="fr_317"></span>[3](#fn_314.md) who speaks from his
mouth, are punishable by stoning; and he who has inquired of them
(offends) against an explicit warning. <span
id="fr_318"></span>[4](#fn_315.md)

**T**. X. 6. The Ba‘al ‘Ob, that is the Python who speaks from between
his joints and elbows, and the Yidd‘oni, who has the bone of a
Yidd‘oni <span id="fr_319"></span>[5](#fn_316.md) in his mouth, are to be
stoned; and he who inquires of them offends against an explicit warning.

7\. HE WHO INQUIRES OF THE DEAD; <span
id="fr_320"></span>[6](#fn_317.md)---that is, one who conjures up the dead
by witchcraft, or one who inquires of a skull. What is the difference
between one who inquires of a skull and one who conjures up the dead by
witchcraft? When one conjures up the dead by witchcraft it (the ghost)
does not come up in the proper way, <span
id="fr_321"></span>[7](#fn_318.md) nor will it come up on the Sabbath; but
when one inquires of a skull it comes up in the ordinary way, and will
also come up on the Sabbath.
