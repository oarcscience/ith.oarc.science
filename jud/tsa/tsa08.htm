<p><b>M</b>. II. 2. The king can neither judge nor be judged, he may not bear witness nor be witnessed against. He may not perform the <i>&#7717;ali&#7779;a</i> ceremony nor may it be performed in the case of his wife. He may not marry his deceased brother's wife, if she be childless, nor may any of his brothers marry his widow. R. Jehuda said: If he were willing to perform the <i>&#7717;ali&#7779;a</i> ceremony or to marry his deceased brother's wife, it would be remembered to his credit. It was answered: If he were willing he should not be listened to. No one may marry his widow. But R. Jehuda holds that a king may marry a king's widow, since it is written: AND I WILL GIVE THEE THY MASTER'S HOUSE, AND THY MASTER'S WIVES INTO THY BOSOM.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>3. If a death occur in his family, he may not leave the palace. R. Jehuda maintains that he may, if he wish, follow the bier, just as David followed Abner's bier, as it is written: DAVID THE KING WENT AFTER THE BIER.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> But it was said in reply: That was done only to placate the people.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> When they hold the funeral meal with</p>

<p>4. He may undertake an aggressive war by permission of the court of seventy-one judges. He may force a way through (private property) and none may check him; the king's road has no limit. When the people have indulged in plunder they must first give it to him, and he takes his share before others.</p>  
<p>HE MAY NOT HAVE NUMEROUS WIVES&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--only eighteen.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_151"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> R. Jehuda holds that he may have many provided they do not turn aside his heart. R. Shimeon asserts: He may not marry even one if she should turn aside his heart; else why should it say, HE MAY NOT HAVE NUMEROUS WIVES, even though they be the like of Abigail?</p>  
<p>HE MAY NOT HAVE NUMEROUS HORSES--only such as suffice for his chariot. AND SILVER AND GOLD HE MAY NOT MULTIPLY TO HIMSELF--only such as suffices for wages. HE SHALL WRITE FOR HIMSELF A COPY OF THE LAW; when he goes out to war it shall go with him, and when he comes in it shall be with him. It shall be beside him when he sits in judgment, and when he sits at meat it shall be before him, for it is written: IT SHALL BE WITH HIM AND HE SHALL READ THEREIN ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE.</p>

<p><DIR><b>T</b>. IV. 2. The king of Israel may not stand in the row to be consoled, nor to console others; nor may he go to hold the funeral meal with others, but others may go to hold the funeral meal with him, as it is written: AND THE PEOPLE WENT TO HOLD THE FUNERAL MEAL WITH DAVID,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_153"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> etc. If he have transgressed a positive or negative command he is treated as an ordinary commoner in every respect.</p>  
<p>He does not perform the <i>&#7717;ali&#7779;a</i> ceremony, nor is it performed in the case of his wife. He does not marry his deceased brother's wife if she be childless, nor does his brother marry his wife. R. Jehuda says: If he wish to perform the <i>&#7717;ali&#7779;a</i> ceremony he may. But it was replied: A king's honour must not receive hurt. No one may marry his widow, for it is written: So THEY WERE SHUT UP TO THE DAY OF THEIR DEATH, LIVING IN WIDOWHOOD.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_153"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> He may choose for himself wives wheresoever he please from among the priestly, Levitic, and Israelitish families.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_155"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> None may ride on his horse, or sit on his royal chair, and none may make use of his crown or sceptre or any of the regalia.

<p>4. When the king is present, all the people stand, and he keeps seated. (And none may sit in the temple courtyard except the kings of the house of David.) And all the people maintain silence when he speaks. He used to address them: "My brethren and my people," as it is written:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> HEAR YE, MY BRETHREN AND MY PEOPLE: while they address him: <font size="-1" color="green">"</font>Our lord and our master," as it is written:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> BUT OUR LORD DAVID THE KING HATH MADE SOLOMON KING.</p>  
<p>5. HE MAY NOT HAVE NUMEROUS WIVES--Such as Jezebel; but the like of Abigail are permitted--so R. Jehuda. HE MAY NOT HAVE NUMEROUS HORSES--not even one horse that remains idle, for it is written: LEST HE SHOULD MULTIPLY HORSES. R. Jehuda says, Behold it is written:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> AND SOLOMON HAD FORTY THOUSAND STALLS OF HORSES, and he did well, since it is written:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> AND JUDAH AND ISRAEL WERE MANY AS THE SAND THAT IS ON THE SEASHORE FOR MULTITUDE. And since it is written:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> TWELVE THOUSAND HORSEMEN, it follows that there were some of the horses left idle.</p>  
<p>The above prohibitions do not apply to a mere commoner. R. Jose says: All that is ordained in the "paragraph of the king "&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> is permitted. R. Jehuda says: This chapter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> was only uttered to impress the people with fear, for it is written: THOU SHALT SURELY SET OVER THEE A KING.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>

<p>6. The property of those put to death by the court goes to their heirs, while that of those put to death by the king belongs to the king. But the majority hold that the property of those put to death by the king goes to their heirs. R. Jehuda said to them, It is written: BEHOLD HE (AHAB) IS IN THE VINEYARD OF NABOTH WHITHER HE IS GONE DOWN TO POSSESS IT.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> They replied: Since he was the son of his father's brother,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> it was right for him to inherit.

<p>7. AND HE SHALL WRITE FOR HIMSELF A COPY OF THE LAW--that he be not dependent on that of his fathers, but on his own, for it is written: HE SHALL WRITE FOR HIMSELF--it must be written for himself only; and a commoner may not read therein, for it is written, <i>HE</i> SHALL READ THEREIN-the king, and no other. Also, the copy shall be revised in a court of the priests, and in a court of the Levites, and in a court of the Israelites who are eligible for marriage into the priestly families. When he goes to war, it shall be with him; when he enters in, it shall be with him; and when he goes to the court, it shall be beside him. When he goes to the toilet chamber, it is kept ready for him by the door. And thus David says: I HAVE SET GOD ALWAYS BEFORE ME (AND HE IS ON MY RIGHT HAND).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> R. Jehuda, says: The book of the Law is on his right hand and the <i>tefillin</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> on his arm.</p>  
<p>R Jose said: It was fitting that the Law should have been given through Ezra even if Moses had not gone before him. A <i>going up</i> is mentioned in the case of Moses, and a <i>going up</i> in the case of Ezra; of Moses, as it is written:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> AND MOSES WENT UP UNTO GOD; and of Ezra, as it is written: AND HE, EZRA, WENT UP FROM BABYLON.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> As the <i>going up</i> of Moses taught the Law to Israel (as it is written: AND THE LORD COMMANDED ME AT THAT TIME TO TEACH YOU STATUTES AND JUDGMENTS),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> so the <i>going up</i> of Ezra taught the Law to</DIR></p>

<p>Also a writing and language was given through him, as it is written: AND THE WRITING OF THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN THE ARAMAIC CHARACTER AND INTERPRETED IN THE ARAMAIC TONGUE&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_180"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; as its interpretation was in Aramaic so its writing was in Aramaic. And it is written: BUT THEY COULD NOT READ THE WRITING, NOR MAKE KNOWN TO THE KING THE INTERPRETATION THEREOF,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> showing that it was not made known till the time of Ezra. Moreover it is written: AND HE SHALL WRITE A <i>COPY</i> (<i>mishneh</i>) OF THIS LAW, <i>i.e.</i> a Law which was at a future time to be <i>changed</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>And why is the name of the writing called <i>Assyrian</i>? Because it came up with them from Assyria.

<p>Why is it called <i>Assyrian?</i> Because the characters of their writing were made <i>upright</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Why is it written: AND HE SHALL WRITE FOR HIMSELF A <i>COPY</i> OF THIS LAW? TO show that he must write <i>two</i> books of the Law: one with which he goes in and out, and another that is placed for him within the house. The one that goes in and out with him does not go in with him to the bath-house or toilet chamber, for it is written: AND IT SHALL BE WITH HIM, AND HE SHALL <i>READ</i> THEREIN ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE; <i>i.e.</i> it shall only go with him in places where it is possible to read.</p>  
<p>And is there not here an argument <i>a fortiori?</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> Since, even of the king of Israel who is entirely engrossed with the needs of the community, it is said: AND IT SHALL BE WITH HIM AND HE SHALL READ THEREIN ALL THE DAYS OF HIS LIFE, still more should the rule apply to the rest of the children of men.</p>

<p>10. A king cannot be appointed outside the land of Israel, nor can one be appointed unless he be eligible for marriage into the priestly families. And kings cannot be anointed except over a spring, for it is written:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_197"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> AND HE SAID TO THEM, TAKE WITH YOU THE SERVANTS OF YOUR LORD, AND MOUNT SOLOMON MY SON UPON MINE OWN MULE, AND BRING HIM DOWN TO GIHON.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_198"></A><A HREF="#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>11. Kings are only anointed when there is a dissension (as to who is the rightful king). Why did they anoint Solomon? Because of the dissension of Adonijah. And Jehu? Because of Joram. And Joash? Because of Athaliah. And Jehoahaz? Because of Jehoiakim his brother, who was his senior by two years.</p>  
<p>A king must be anointed, but not one who is the son&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_199"></A><A HREF="#fn_198"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> of a king. Yet a high-priest, even though he be descended from a line of high-priests as far back as ten generations, must be anointed.</p>  
<p>Kings are only anointed from a horn. Saul and Jehu were anointed from a pot,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_199"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> because their kingdom was destined to be broken. David and Solomon were anointed from a horn, for their kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.</DIR></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_168"></A><A HREF="tsa08.htm#fr_169">52:5</A> One of the five sons of R. Jose b. Halafta (see T. 2. I). He accompanied R. Shimeon b. Jochai on his mission to Rome, which succeeded in securing the withdrawal of the persecuting Hadrianic decrees. Though quoted in the <i>Tosefta</i>, he is never mentioned in the <i>Mishnah</i>.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_172"></A><A HREF="tsa08.htm#fr_173">52:9</A> This curious statement has no biblical basis. Although the remark appears to be accepted by R. Jehuda it would appear to be a <i>petitio principii</i> of the crudest kind. It is taken for granted that because Jezebel regarded the death of Naboth as the only obstacle to Ahab's possessing the vineyard, therefore Ahab was Naboth's nearest relation. And since it is possible to show that he was not Naboth's brother, father, or son, he must have been his nephew. According to B. 48 <i>b</i>, he was his cousin.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_183"></A><A HREF="tsa08.htm#fr_184">54:5</A> Lit., "broken, rugged;" is supposed to refer to the peculiar shape of the letters in the Samaritan script. There is a variant <i>da&#8217;a&#7779;</i>, which might mean "wedge-like," and so refer to the cuneiform writing. See A. E. Cowley in <i>J. Th. S.</i> vol. XI, p. 542. What is in the text called <i>Assyrian writing</i> clearly refers to the modern Hebrew square character.</P>
