<p>How do they carry out an alteration (in the city and Temple courtyards)? The court issues forth and the two thank-offerings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> behind them; of these offerings the inner one (nearest the members of the court) is eaten, and the other burnt.

<p>Abba Shaul&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> said: There were two valleys in Jerusalem, a lower one and an upper one.

In the upper valley, whose consecration was not complete, the common people used to eat the lesser holy things, but not the Second tithe; whereas the more learned used to eat neither. Why had not the upper valley been consecrated? Because it was a weak part of Jerusalem, and could easily be captured.</p>  
<p>5. R. Jose said three things in the name of three elders:--R. Akiba said: Could a man bring up the firstborn of beasts to Jerusalem from outside of the land of Israel? Scripture says: AND THOU SHALT EAT BEFORE THE LORD THY GOD THE TITHE OF THY CORN AND WINE AND OIL, AND THE FIRSTBORN OF BEASTS.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> That is to say, from the place whence thou bringest the tithe of corn, thou bringest the firstborn of beasts; since thou canst not bring the tithe of corn from outside the land of Israel, neither canst thou bring the firstborn of beasts from outside the land of Israel.</p>  
<p>Shimeon,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the son of Zoma said: May it not be that as the Law distinguishes between the most holy things and lesser holy things, so also it makes a distinction between the firstborn of beasts and the Second tithe? The customary argument (which proves that there is no difference between the two) is: Since they must both be brought to the temple, therefore they must both be consumed within its walls. (But the analogy is not complete), for the time of the eating of the firstborn of beasts is limited, hence the place of its eating is likewise limited; whereas the time of eating of the Second tithe is not limited. Therefore, since the time of its eating is not limited, neither can the place of its eating</DIR></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>T</b>.</FONT></span><DIR>be limited (to within the temple walls). Scripture says: AND THOU SHALT EAT BEFORE THE LORD THY GOD THE TITHE OF THY CORN AND WINE AND OIL, AND THE FIRSTBORN OF BEASTS. Therefore since the firstborn of beasts is only eaten within the temple walls, so the Second tithe is only eaten within the Temple walls.</p>  
<p>6. R. Ishmael&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> says: Ought a man to bring up the Second tithe to Jerusalem at this time&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and eat it? The customary argument would be: Since the firstborn of beasts must be brought to the temple and the Second tithe must be brought to the temple, therefore as the firstborn of beasts is only consumed within the temple, so the Second tithe can only be consumed within the temple. (But the analogy is not complete), for not as thou dost argue in the case of the firstborn of beasts--where there are sprinklings of blood and sacrificial portions laid on the altar--canst thou argue in the case of the Second tithe, where there are no sprinklings and no sacrificial portions. Should the case of the offering of firstfruits be brought forward as an argument, in which are no sprinklings and no sacrificial portions, and which may only be consumed within the temple, (it can be answered that the analogy here is not complete,) for not as thou dost argue in the case of the firstfruits which must be laid before the altar, canst thou argue in the case of the Second tithe which is not to be laid before the altar. (But such a distinction cannot be drawn, for) Scripture says: AND THOU SHALT EAT BEFORE THE LORD THY GOD THE TITHE OF THY CORN AND WINE AND</DIR></p>

As the first- born of beasts is only eaten within the temple, so the Second tithe can only be eaten within the temple.</p>  
<p>Others say: May it not be with the firstborn, that after the first year has elapsed it becomes like unfit offerings, and so unfit to be brought up to Jerusalem? Scripture says: THOU SHALT EAT BEFORE THE LORD THY GOD THE TITHE OF THY CORN AND WINE AND OIL, AND THE FIRSTBORN, etc. If this were intended to teach that the firstborn can only be consumed within the temple, it would be superfluous, since it has already been said:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> BEFORE THE LORD THY GOD THOU SHALT EAT IT YEAR BY YEAR. Or if it were intended to teach that the Second tithe can only be consumed within the temple, it would be superfluous, since it has already been said:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> THOU SHALT NOT BE ABLE TO CONSUME IT WITHIN THY GATES. Then why does it say, THE TITHE OF THY CORN AND WINE AND OIL, AND THE FIRSTBORN? It compares the firstborn with the Second tithe: as the Second tithe must be consumed from year to year to year, so the firstborn must be consumed from year to year.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></DIR></p>
