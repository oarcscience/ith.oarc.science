### The Method of admonishing Witnesses in Capital Cases.

M. IV. 5*a*. How were witnesses admonished in capital cases? They were
brought in, and admonished to the effect that "what you say may be
merely your own opinion, or hearsay, or secondhand, or derived from a
trustworthy person. Perhaps you do not know that we intend to question
you by examination and inquiry. Know, moreover, that capital cases are
not like non-capital cases: in non-capital cases a man may pay money and
so make expiation; but in capital cases the blood of the accused and of
his posterity may cling to him (the witness) to the end of the world.
For so we find it in the case of Cain, who slew his brother, as it is
written: THE VOICE OF THE BLOODS OF THY BROTHER CRIES TO ME FROM THE
GROUND <span id="fr_254"></span>[1](#fn_251.md);--not the blood of thy
brother, but the bloods of thy brother--his blood and that of his
posterity."

Another explanation: *BLOODS* OF THY BROTHER;--because his blood was
scattered over the trees and stones.

**T**. VIII. 3. ("Merely your own opinion.") With what object is this
said? In order that the witness should not (for example) bring forward
as evidence: "We saw the defendant with a sword in his hand running
after his fellow; the latter thereupon fled into a shop followed by the
other; we went in after them and found the one slain, and in the

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

hand of the murderer was a sword dripping blood." And lest thou shouldst
say: "If not he, who then did kill him?" (take warning from the example
of) Shimeon, the son of Shatah, who said, "May I not live to see the
consolation if I once did not see a man with a sword in his hand running
after his fellow; the latter thereupon went into a deserted building
followed by the other; I entered after him and found the one slain and a
sword in the hand of the murderer dripping blood. I said to him: Wicked
man, who slew this one? May I not live to see the consolation if I did
not see him; one of us two must have slain him. But what can I do to
thee, since your condemnation cannot rest in my hands? For the Law says:
AT THE MOUTH OF TWO WITNESSES, OR AT THE MOUTH OF THREE WITNESSES, SHALL
HE WHO DIES BE PUT TO DEATH. But he who knows the thoughts, he exacts
vengeance from the guilty; for the murderer did not stir from that place
before a serpent bit him so that he died."

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>IV. 5 *b*. For this reason man was
created one and alone in the world: to teach that whosoever destroys a
single soul is regarded as though he destroyed a complete world, and
whosoever saves a single soul is regarded as though he saved a complete
world; and for the sake of peace among created beings that one man
should not say to another, "My father was greater than thine," and that
heretics should not say, "There are many ruling powers in heaven "; also
to proclaim the greatness of the King of kings of kings, blessed be He!
for mankind stamps a hundred coins with one seal, and they are all
alike, but the King of kings of kings, blessed be He! has stamped every
man with the seal of the first Adam, and not one of

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>them is like his fellow. <span
id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_252.md) So every single person is forced to say,
The world was created for my sake.

**T**. VIII. 4. Man was created one and alone in the world. And why was
he created one and alone in the world? That the righteous might not say,
"We are the children of a righteous man," and the wicked, "We are the
children of a wicked man."

Another explanation: Why was he created one and alone? That families
might not quarrel: since even now, when all men are come from the same
stock, they quarrel, how much more would they do so if they had come
from different stocks!

Another explanation: Why was man created one and alone? Because of
thieves and robbers: since even now, when all men are come from the one
stock, they rob and steal, how much more would they do so if they had
cone from different stocks?

5\. Another explanation: Why was he created one and alone? To declare
the greatness of the King of kings of kings, blessed be He! who with one
seal fashioned every one in the whole world, yet from the one seal go
forth many impressions, as it is written: IT IS CHANGED AS CLAY UNDER
THE SEAL, AND ALL THINGS STAND FORTH AS IN A GARMENT. <span
id="fr_256"></span>[2](#fn_253.md)

6\. Why are faces unlike each other? Because of impostors--that none
should break into his neighbour's field, or go in unto his neighbour's
wife: AND FROM THE WICKED THEIR LIGHT IS WITHHOLDEN, AND THE HIGH ARM IS
BROKEN. <span id="fr_257"></span>[3](#fn_254.md) R. Meir says: The Almighty
varied the fashion of the face, knowledge and voice; the fashion of the
face and

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

knowledge because of thieves and robbers, and the voice because of
lewdness.

7\. Man was created last (in the order of creation). And why was he
created last? Lest the heretics <span id="fr_258"></span>[1](#fn_255.md)
should say: We (mankind) were partners with God in his work.

8\. Another explanation: Why was man created last? That if his mind
become too proud it may be said to him: "The mosquito preceded thee in
the order of creation."

Another explanation: That he should at once be subject to the laws of
the world.

9\. Another explanation: That he might enter the banquet at once. They
propounded a parable: To what can it be compared? It is like a king who
built a palace and dedicated it, and prepared a banquet and invited the
guests; and so it is written: THE WISEST OF WOMEN HATH BUILDED HER
HOUSE, <span id="fr_259"></span>[2](#fn_256.md)--that is the King of kings
of kings, blessed be He! who created his world in seven days by "wisdom
"; SHE HATH HEWN OUT HER SEVEN PILLARS--these are the seven days of
creation; SHE HATH KILLED HER BEASTS AND MINGLED HER WINE--these are the
seas and rivers and pastures and other needs of the world; SHE HATH SENT
FORTH HER MAIDENS, SHE CRIETH UPON THE HIGH PLACES OF THE CITY, WHO IS
SIMPLE LET HIM TURN IN HITHER, AND HE WHO IS VOID OF UNDERSTANDING,
etc.--these are mankind and the beasts.

IV\. 5*c*. Perhaps you say: "Why do we take this trouble of bearing
witness? " But has it not been written: HE BEING A WITNESS, WHETHER FIE
HATH SEEN OR KNOWN, IF HE DO NOT UTTER IT, THEN SHALL HE BEAR HIS
INIQUITY? <span id="fr_260"></span>[3](#fn_257.md) Or perhaps

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>you say: "Why are we responsible for
this man's blood?" But has it not been written: WHEN THE WICKED PERISH
THERE IS REJOICING? <span id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_258.md)
