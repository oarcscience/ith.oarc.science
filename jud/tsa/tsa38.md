### THOSE PUNISHABLE BY DECAPITATION (*continued*)

### (2) The Members of a Beguiled City.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>X. 4. The members of a beguiled
city, <span id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_438.md)--as it is written: THERE
SHALL GO FORTH FROM THY MIDST MEN, SONS OF BELIAL, AND THEY SHALL
BEGUILE THE INHABITANTS OF THEIR TOWN; <span
id="fr_445"></span>[3](#fn_439.md)--these are not slain unless the
beguilers are from the same town, and unless the majority are beguiled.
Also, the beguilers must be men. If they be women or children, <span
id="fr_446"></span>[4](#fn_440.md) or come from outside of the town, those
who have been beguiled must be regarded as single offenders needing two
witnesses, and every offender must receive the legal warning. The
punishment is more severe in the case of individuals than in that of
multitudes: for individuals are liable to stoning, so that their
property is not confiscate; whereas multitudes suffer (only) from the
sword, and therefore their property is confiscate.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>5. THOU SHALT SMITE THE PEOPLE OF
THAT CITY WITH THE SWORD; but an ass or camel caravan passing through
from place to place--such are to be set free. <span
id="fr_447"></span>[1](#fn_441.md) UTTERLY DESTROY IT, AND ALL THAT IS IN
IT, AND ITS BEASTS, WITH THE SWORD; therefore they have said that the
goods of the righteous in it are lost, but what is outside is saved;
whereas that of the wicked, inside or outside, is lost.

**T**. XIV. 1. "A beguiled city": there never was, and never will be,
such; then why is it contained in Scripture? To teach, "Study and
receive the reward."

Three places in Israel cannot at the same time be adjudged "beguiled
cities," lest the land of Israel be destroyed; but only one or two (at
one time). R. Shimeon says: Not even two (together), but only one in
Judæa and one in Galilee. On the frontier even a single town cannot be
so condemned, lest the heathen break through and destroy the land of
Israel.

When the heavier penalty <span id="fr_448"></span>[2](#fn_442.md) falls on
the men of a beguiled city, a lighter penalty falls on their property
and the city; and when the lighter penalty falls on the men of a
beguiled city, a heavier penalty falls on their property and the city.
For when they are to be stoned, their property and the

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

<span class="margnote">T.</span>

city are not destroyed; but when they are to be slain by the sword,
their property and the city are to be destroyed.

2\. If a caravan of asses or camels, going from place to place, lodge in
the midst of the town, and are beguiled together with it, they are to
die by the sword, and their property and the city are to be
destroyed. <span id="fr_449"></span>[1](#fn_443.md) If they have not
delayed thirty days, they are to be stoned <span
id="fr_450"></span>[2](#fn_444.md) and their property and the city are not
to be destroyed. In every case, those who beguile the city are to be
stoned, <span id="fr_451"></span>[3](#fn_445.md) and their property and the
city are to be destroyed. <span id="fr_452"></span>[4](#fn_446.md)

If women and not men, or minors and not those of full age have beguiled
the city, can it be (properly) a beguiled city? Scripture says: THE
INHABITANTS OF THEIR TOWN;--the matter deals with "the inhabitants" of
their city, and not with any of these.

3\. Those under age, the children of the men of the beguiled city, who
have been beguiled with it, are not to be slain; but R. Eliezer says
that they are to be slain. R. Akiba said to him: I argue from: HE WILL
SHOW THEE MERCY, AND HAVE COMPASSION UPON THEE AND MULTIPLY THEE. <span
id="fr_453"></span>[5](#fn_447.md) If to shew mercy to those who are of age
it is said: THOU SHALT SURELY SMITE; <span
id="fr_454"></span>[6](#fn_448.md) and if to show mercy to the beasts it is
said, UTTERLY DESTROY IT AND ALL THAT IS THEREIN AND ITS BEASTS; <span
id="fr_455"></span>[6](#fn_448.md) I maintain that the words, AND HE WILL
SHOW THEE MERCY, must refer to those in the city who are under age.

R. Eliezer says: Even those who are of age are not slain except at the
mouth of witnesses and

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

after the legal warning. And I argue that the purpose of AND HE WILL
SHOW THEE MERCY is lest the judges say, "If we adjudge this to be a
beguiled city, to-morrow the brethren and the neighbours of those who
have been condemned will preserve hatred in their hearts against us."
But thus saith the Almighty: Behold, I will cause them to have mercy and
to bear my love in their hearts, so that they shall say, "We have naught
against you in our hearts, for ye have uttered a true judgment."

And the friends of the dead do not make (open) lamentation: they mourn,
but only in their hearts.

4\. The property of the righteous that is in the city is lost, but what
is outside escapes; while that of the wicked both within and without is
lost. R. Eliezer says, "This is illustrated by the instance of Lot. He
was in Sodom only for the sake of his property, yet he left the town
empty-handed, as it is written: ESCAPE THITHER IN HASTE, <span
id="fr_456"></span>[1](#fn_449.md) as if to say " Let it suffice thee that
thou escape with thy life." Said R. Shimeon: Why is it said, "The
property of the righteous that is therein is lost "? Because it is the
property of the righteous which makes them dwell among the ungodly. And
is it not an example of the *a fortiori* argument? If mere property,
which cannot hear or see or speak, is condemned by the Almighty to be
burnt because it makes the righteous live among the ungodly, much more
ought the man to be burnt who turns away his fellow from the way of life
to the way of death.

M. X. 6a. ALL THE SPOIL THEREOF THOU SHALT GATHER INTO THE MIDST OF THE
MARKETPLACE <span id="fr_457"></span>[2](#fn_450.md); if it have no
market-place they must make one. If the market-place is outside, they

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>bring it inside, for it is written:
INTO THE MIDST (OF) ITS MARKET-PLACE.

AND THOU SHALT BURN THE WHOLE CITY AND ALL ITS SPOIL WITH FIRE; *its*
spoil, but not spoil belonging to Heaven. Therefore the holy things in
it are redeemed, <span id="fr_458"></span>[1](#fn_451.md) the
heave-offerings allowed to rot, and the Second Tithe and the Scriptures
stored away. <span id="fr_459"></span>[2](#fn_452.md)

**T**. XIV. 5. Offerings intended for the altar shall die, but those for
the Temple repairs are to be redeemed. R. Shimeon says: *ITS* CATTLE
excludes the firstborn of cattle, and the tithes; and *ITS* SPOIL
excludes money belonging to the Temple or the money for the Second
Tithe. <span id="fr_460"></span>[3](#fn_453.md) What is immovable, whether
holy or not holy, is not to be destroyed, for it is said, THOU SHALT
GATHER, thus excluding what is immovable. But in the other city (*i.e.*
Jericho) <span id="fr_461"></span>[4](#fn_454.md) everything, whether
immovable or not, was destroyed.

X. 6*b*. A WHOLE OFFERING TO THE LORD THY M. GOD; R. Shimeon said: ("It
is as if God said:) When you exercise judgment in a beguiled city, I
will consider it as though you offer me a whole offering." AND IT SHALL
BE A PERPETUAL HEAP AND SHALL NEVER AGAIN BE BUILT UPON;--you may not
even make gardens or parks,--so R. Jose the Galilæan; but R. Akiba says:
AND SHALL NEVER AGAIN BE BUILT UPON, means that it shall

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>not be built as it was before; but
gardens and parks may be made of it.

THOU SHALT KEEP NAUGHT OF THE ACCURSED THING, THAT THE LORD MAY TURN
FROM THE HEAT OF HIS WRATH AND SHOW THEE MERCY AND KINDNESS AND INCREASE
THEE;--the whole time that the ungodly is in the world, the HEAT OF
WRATH is in the world; when the ungodly is perished from the world, the
HEAT OF WRATH is taken from the world.

**T**. XIV. 6. If they slay the men, and burn the clothing, and
hamstring the cattle (is this according to the Law?) <span
id="fr_462"></span>[1](#fn_455.md) R. Meir says, "Where it is customary to
destroy by shedding blood, you shed blood; where it is by burning, you
burn; and where by hamstringing, you hamstring."

A man is not put to death by means of arrows or spears, and not with the
point of the sword but with its edge, as it is written: WITH THE EDGE OF
THE SWORD. <span id="fr_463"></span>[2](#fn_456.md)

AND IT SHALL BE A PERPETUAL HEAP, AND SHALL NO MORE BE BUILT; <span
id="fr_464"></span>[3](#fn_457.md)--they shall not even make it into
gardens or parks,--so R. Jose the Galilæan; but R. Akiba says: IT SHALL
NO MORE BE BUILT, that is, in the form that it was before it shall not
be built up; but it may be made into gardens and parks.

AND IT SHALL BE A PERPETUAL HEAP, as it was in the days of Joshua. R.
Jose and R. Jehoshua, the son of Karha, say: Behold it says, CURSED Is
THE MAN BEFORE THE LORD WHO SHALL RISE AND BUILD THIS CITY,
JERICHO; <span id="fr_465"></span>[4](#fn_458.md) but do we not know

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

<span class="margnote">T.</span>

that Jericho is now there? The command was that it should not be rebuilt
and called by the name of another city; and that another city should not
be built and called by the name of Jericho.

7\. WITH THE LOSS OF HIS FIRSTBORN SHALL HE LAY THE FOUNDATION THEREOF,
AND WITH THE LOSS OF HIS YOUNGEST SON SHALL HE SET UP THE GATES
THEREOF; <span id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_459.md) and so it says: IN HIS
DAYS DID HIEL THE BETHELITE BUILD JERICHO. <span
id="fr_467"></span>[2](#fn_460.md) But did not Hiel belong to the kingdom
of Jehoshaphat, <span id="fr_468"></span>[3](#fn_461.md) and was not
Jericho in the district of Benjamin? <span
id="fr_469"></span>[4](#fn_462.md) Then why is the matter connected with
Ahab? <span id="fr_470"></span>[5](#fn_463.md) To teach that guilt is
connected with him who is guilty. 8. Similarly it is written: AND
JONATHAN THE SON OF GERSHOM THE SON OF MANASSEH. <span
id="fr_471"></span>[6](#fn_464.md) But was he the son of Manasseh? Was he
not the son of Moses? <span id="fr_472"></span>[7](#fn_465.md) Then why is
the matter connected with Manasseh? To teach that guilt is connected
with him who is guilty. 9. WITH THE LOSS OF ABIRAM HIS FIRSTBORN HE LAID
THE FOUNDATION THEREOF, AND WITH THE LOSS OF SEGUB HIS YOUNGEST SON HE
SET UP THE GATES THEREOF. In the case of Abiram, (Hiel) had no warning
from which to learn; <span id="fr_473"></span>[8](#fn_466.md) but in the
case of Segub, the wicked man had such a warning. But they sought to
increase their wealth. Why? Because a curse rested on them, so that they
continually decreased, as Scripture says, ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF THE
LORD WHICH HE SPAKE BY THE HAND OF JOSHUA THE SON OF NUN. <span
id="fr_474"></span>[9](#fn_467.md)

10\. R. Shimeon, the son of Eleazar, says: He did not build the old
Jericho, but another one; and

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

after it was built he was allowed to inhabit it, for it is said: AND THE
SONS OF THE PROPHETS WHICH WERE IN JERICHO DREW NEAR TO ELISHA. <span
id="fr_475"></span>[1](#fn_468.md) Therefore it is not possible for the
court to say, "We are condemning a place as a beguiled city, and so
destroying the land of Israel"; <span id="fr_476"></span>[2](#fn_469.md)
but as there is joy in the presence of the Almighty at the continuance
of the righteous, so there is joy in the presence of the Almighty at the
destruction of the wicked, as it is written: WHEN THE WICKED PERISH,
THERE IS REJOICING. <span id="fr_477"></span>[3](#fn_470.md)

11\. Whatsoever is left of a beguiled city and its inhabitants, together
with the fruits, or any idol pedestal and what is on it, a
*merkolis* <span id="fr_478"></span>[4](#fn_471.md) and what is on it, or
anything to which the prohibitions <span id="fr_479"></span>[5](#fn_472.md)
dealing with idolatry apply, is forbidden, and no benefit may be derived
from it.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[129:2](tsa38.htm#fr_444.md) Bomberg text adds
"have no share in the world to come," wrongly assimilating the section
to the preceding paragraphs. The *Mishnah* here takes up the second head
announced for treatment in M. IX. 1*b* (p. 125). Cf. Introduction, [p.
viii](tsa01.htm#page_viii), n. [2](tsa01.htm#fn_4.md).

add: "or if only a minority be beguiled."

<span id="fn_441"></span>[130:1](tsa38.htm#fr_447.md) This is the
preferable reading. Another reading: "These may save it \[*i.e.* the
town\]" is found in C and the Bomberg text; this has to be explained as
meaning that the passers-by, being temporarily members of the city, and
remaining (so we have to take for granted) unbeguiled, help to make the
unbeguiled a majority; in which case the place is no longer a beguiled
city. The beguiled minority will then be classed as individual
idolators, subject to the penalty of stoning.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[130:2](tsa38.htm#fr_448.md) See *Mishnah* VII.
1.; stoning is first and slaying by the sword (decapitation) third in
order of severity; see also previous note.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[133:2](tsa38.htm#fr_459.md) They are too sacred
to destroy; therefore they are buried to preserve them from any
sacrilegious use.

as an historical example of a " beguiled city."

<span id="fn_455"></span>[134:1](tsa38.htm#fr_462.md) Because Josh. 6. 21
says, "They utterly destroyed all . with the edge of the sword" . . .

<span id="fn_468"></span>[136:1](tsa38.htm#fr_475.md) 2 Kings 2. 5; showing
that people lived in Jericho shortly after the time of Hiel.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[136:2](tsa38.htm#fr_476.md) Since the case of
Jericho is evidence that a condemned " beguiled city " may be rebuilt.
