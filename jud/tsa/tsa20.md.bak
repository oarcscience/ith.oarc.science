### 7. The Blasphemer.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VII. 5. The blasphemer <span
id="fr_305"></span>[2](#fn_302.md) is not guilty until he have expressly
uttered the Name. According to R. Jehoshua, the son of Karha, the
witnesses throughout are examined by means of pseudonyms: <span
id="fr_306"></span>[3](#fn_303.md) for example " Jose strikes Jose." But
when the trial is over the sentence is not carried out under a
pseudonym: all are sent out of the room except the chief witness, and it
is said to him: "Say expressly what you heard." He does so, whereupon
the judges stand up and rend their clothes; <span
id="fr_307"></span>[4](#fn_304.md) and they may not mend them again. The
second witness then says, "I heard the same," and the third says, "I too
heard the same."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_302"></span>[98:2](tsa20.htm#fr_305.md) See Lev. 24. 10 ff.
According to the Talmud (cf. *Yoma* 39 b), the pronunciation of the
Sacred Name was at one time known to all; but "from the time that Simon
the Just died"--the customary expression for the beginning of the
Hellenistic period--it was gradually forgotten.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[98:3](tsa20.htm#fr_306.md) The witnesses who had
heard the blasphemy might not repeat the words, but made use of an
arbitrary formula to describe the crime.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[98:4](tsa20.htm#fr_307.md) Cf. Mark 14. 63; Matt.
26. 65.
