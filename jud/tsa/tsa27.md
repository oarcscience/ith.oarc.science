### 15. The Beguiler to Idolatry.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VII. 10*a*. "He who acts the part of
a beguiler " <span id="fr_330"></span>[2](#fn_326.md) refers to one
commoner who beguiles another commoner. If he have said, "There is a god
in such a place who eats this, drinks that, benefits in this way, does
harm in that way," then only in such cases among the capital charges
laid down in the Law, is it proper to lie in wait for the criminal. If
he have said this to two people they act as his witnesses, bring him to
the court and stone him. If he have said it only to one, this one may
reply, "I have some friends who would consent in this"; but if the
idolater is crafty, and will not speak of it before them, witnesses may
be concealed behind a wall. Thereupon the first witness

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>says, "Tell me between ourselves
what you said to me before." He does so. Then the former replies: "How
can we leave our God who is in Heaven and go and worship wood and
stone?" If he retract what he said, good; but if he say, "It is our duty
and good for us," they who are behind the wall bring him to the court
and stone him.

He is guilty as a beguiler who says, "I will worship (other gods)," "I
will go and worship," "Let us go and worship"; "I will sacrifice," "I
will go and sacrifice," "Let us go and sacrifice"; "I will offer
incense," "I will go and offer incense," "Let us go and offer incense;"
"I will make libation," "I will go and make libation," "Let us go and
make libation"; "I will bow myself down," "I will go and bow myself
down," "Let us go and bow ourselves down."

**T**. X. 11. In the case of any one who is liable to death penalties
enjoined in the Law, it is not proper to lie in wait for him except he
be a beguiler. How do they lie in wait? Two disciples are stationed in
an inner room, while the culprit is in an outer room. A candle is lit
and so placed that they can see him as well as hear his voice And so
they did to Ben Stada in Lud. <span id="fr_331"></span>[1](#fn_327.md)
These same two disciples are

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

appointed as witnesses against him, and stone him. His case may be begun
by day and finished by night; they may begin and end it on the same day,
whether he be guilty or not; they may arrive at a verdict by a majority
of one whether it be for conviction or acquittal; all may plead for
acquittal or all for conviction; one who pleads for acquittal may
retract and plead for conviction. <span id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_328.md)
The eunuch and the childless can act as judges, and, according to R.
Jehuda, even those who are biased in the direction of severity.

XI\. 1. As for others liable to death penalties in the court, they can
only be condemned at the mouth of witnesses, and even so, only if they
have been warned and told that they are liable to the penalty of death
in the court. R. Jose, the son of Jehuda, says: "They must also be told
what manner of death they will incur." No matter whether all or only
some of the witnesses warn him, he is guilty; but R. Jose would acquit
unless all his witnesses warn him, for it is written: AT THE MOUTH OF
TWO WITNESSES, <span id="fr_333"></span>[2](#fn_329.md) that is, until two
witnesses warn together; though R. Jose allows that if the first witness
warned him and then went away, and the second warned him and then went
away, the man would be liable to the penalty.

2\. If he be warned and answer nothing, or if he be warned and nod his
head, or even say, "I know," he cannot be made liable to the death
penalty; he is not liable until he say, "I know; but even so I am
committing the offence." 3. If, for example, he be seen defiling the
Sabbath, and be told, "You must know that it is the Sabbath, and it is
written, THOSE WHO DEFILE IT SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH," <span
id="fr_334"></span>[3](#fn_330.md) even if he say, "I know," he is free
from penalty; he is free until he

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

say, "I know; but even so I am committing the offence."

4\. Or again, if he be seen slaying a man, and be told, "Know that he is
a son of the covenant, and it is written, WHOSO SHEDDETH MAN'S BLOOD, BY
MAN SHALL HIS BLOOD BE SHED," <span id="fr_335"></span>[1](#fn_331.md) even
if he say, "I know," he is free from penalty; he is free until he say,
"I know; but even so I am committing the offence."

5*a*. R. Jose said, "If he warn himself, he is free from penalty, for it
is written: IF AN UNRIGHTEOUS MAN RISE UP TO TESTIFY AGAINST HIM OF
WRONG-DOING, <span id="fr_336"></span>[2](#fn_332.md) etc.; therefore he
should be warned by others, and not by himself."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_326"></span>[103:2](tsa27.htm#fr_330.md) Deut. 13. 6-1
"Commoner" is mentioned to exclude the "false prophet" who (*Mishnah*
XI. 5) is punishable by strangulation.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[104:1](tsa27.htm#fr_331.md) *Sanh*. 67*a*
continues: "Whom they hanged on the eve of the Passover." Ben Stada was
the son of Pandera. (Then why is he called the son of Stada?) R. Hisda
said: "The husband of his mother was called Stada, and her seducer
Pandera." But the husband was known to be Pappus ben Jehuda, and the
mother's (real) name Miriam M’gadd’la (the women's hairdresser). And
*Stada* was the name applied to her in that *s’tath da*, "she went
astray" from her husband." On the identifications arising from this, see
R. T. Herford, *Christianity in Talmud and Midrash* (London, 1903), and
G. H. Box, *The Virgin Birth of Jesus* (London, 1916), Appendix I.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[105:1](tsa27.htm#fr_332.md) Customary rules for
capital trials in his case are in abeyance. See *Mishnah* IV. i; cf.
