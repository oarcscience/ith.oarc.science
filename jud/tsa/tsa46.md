### (7) The False Witnesses against a Priest's Daughter.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>6*c*. "The false witnesses against a
priest's daughter, and the one who is her paramour":--all false
witnesses are subject to the same death penalty (to which the accused
has been made liable) except in the case of the false witnesses against
the priest's daughter and her paramour (who are to be strangled). <span

**T**. XIV. 17. All perjurers and illicit paramours are subject to the
same death penalty to which their victim has been condemned: if it was
stoning they are to be stoned; if it was burning they are to be burned.
In what cases does this hold good? When the same death can be inflicted:
when the death penalty attached to the crime is stoning, the accused is
stoned, and also the perjurers; when burning is the penalty, both
accused and perjurers are burnt. But in the present case, the unjustly
accused is burnt, while the perjurers are strangled.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_498"></span>[141:2](tsa46.htm#fr_505.md) The law of the false
witness is derived from Deut. 19. 16 ff. On the "priest's daughter," see
*Mishnah* IX. 1. Scripture (Lev. 21. 9) is silent as to the fate of the
paramour; but since it must be assumed that he is to be put to death,
and none of the three Biblical methods is authorized, "strangling" must
be employed. See [p. 95](tsa17.htm#page_95), note [3](tsa17.htm#fn_292.md).
