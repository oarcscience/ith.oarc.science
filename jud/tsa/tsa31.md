### The Housebreaker.

M. VIII. 6. The housebreaker <span id="fr_365"></span>[1](#fn_361.md) is
condemned in view of what he might do afterwards. If in his breaking
through he have broken a barrel, where there would be
blood-guiltiness <span id="fr_366"></span>[2](#fn_362.md) (if the
householder killed him) he is liable (to payment of compensation); if
there would be no blood-guiltiness, <span
id="fr_367"></span>[3](#fn_363) he is free (from that liability.md).

**T**. XI. 9. The housebreaker, if he come to kill, may be saved (from
sin) at the cost of his life; if it be only to seize property, he may
not be saved (from sin) at the cost of his life; nor should he be so
treated if there is a doubt whether he come to kill or to seize
property, for it is written: IF THE SUN BE RISEN UPON HIM, THERE SHALL
BE BLOODGUILTINESS FOR HIM. <span id="fr_368"></span>[4](#fn_364.md) But
does the sun rise over him alone and not over all the world? But as at
the rising of the sun there is peace over all the world, so, as long as
thou knowest that his intentions are peaceful, whether it be day or
night, thou mayest not save him (from sin) at the cost of his life.

R. Eliezer, <span id="fr_369"></span>[5](#fn_365.md) the son of Jacob, said
further: If

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

there were there jugs of wine or oil, and he broke them when he broke
through, he is liable to be killed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_361"></span>[112:1](tsa31.htm#fr_365.md) Exod. 22. 2-4.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[112:2](tsa31.htm#fr_366.md) That is, by day.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[112:3](tsa31.htm#fr_367.md) That is, by night.
The principle here assumed is, that "one who becomes liable to two
penalties is to be condemned to the severer one" (cf. M. IX. 9); with
the corollary that "he who commits a crime which leads to capital
punishment is absolved from any payment of money compensation" (*Sanh*.
73*b*). An illustrative case is given in *B. Kama* III. 10: A man who
fires his neighbour's corn is liable to compensation; if he have fired
it on the Sabbath he is free from the liability of paying compensation
for the corn, but he is subject to the death penalty for desecrating the
Sabbath.

Eliezer b. Hyrcanus. He was considered the authority on the structural
details of the Temple.
