### \[AN INTERPOLATED SECTION.\] <span id="fr_387"></span>[\*](#fn_383.md)

### Those Who have no Share in the World to Come.

X. I. These are they who have no share in the world to come: <span
id="fr_388"></span>[2](#fn_384.md) who say there is no resurrection of the
dead; <span id="fr_389"></span>[3](#fn_385.md) that the Law is not from
Heaven; and the Epicureans. <span id="fr_390"></span>[4](#fn_386.md) R.
Akiba adds: He who reads the external books; <span
id="fr_391"></span>[5](#fn_387.md) and he who whispers over a wound,
saying: ALL THE SICKNESS WHICH I BROUGHT ON EGYPT I WILL NOT BRING UPON
THEE, <span id="fr_392"></span>[6](#fn_388.md) etc. Abba Shaul adds: He who
pronounces the Name with its proper letters. <span
id="fr_393"></span>[7](#fn_389.md)

**T**. XII. 9. To these they added: they who break the yoke and violate
the covenant, <span id="fr_394"></span>[8](#fn_390.md) or misinterpret

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

the Law, or pronounce the Name with its proper letters, <span
id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_391) have no share in the world to come. (10.md)
R. Akiba says: He who, at a banquet, renders the Song of Songs in a
sing-song way, turning it into a common ditty, has no share in the world
to come. Abba Shaul, in the name of R. Akiba, says: He also who whispers
over a wound, "It is written, AND ALL THE SICKNESS WHICH I BROUGHT UPON
EGYPT I WILL NOT BRING UPON THEE," and spits, <span
id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_392.md) has no share in the world to come.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>X. 2. Three kings and four commoners
have no share in the world to come. The three kings are Jeroboam, Ahab,
and Manasseh. R. Jehuda holds that Manasseh has a share in the world to
come, for it is written: HE PRAYED AND MADE SUPPLICATION, AND HE HEARD
HIS PRAYER AND BROUGHT HIM BACK TO HIS KINGDOM AT JERUSALEM. <span
id="fr_397"></span>[3](#fn_393.md) They replied: He was restored to his
kingdom but not to life in the world to come. The four commoners are
Balaam, Doeg, Ahithophel, and Gehazi.

**T**. XII. xi. Four kings, Jeroboam, Ahab, Ahaz, and Manasseh have no
share in the world to come. R. Jehuda says: Manasseh has a share in the
world to come, for it is written: HIS PRAYER ALSO, AND HOW GOD WAS
ENTREATED OF HIM, AND ALL HIS SIN AND HIS TRESPASS, AND THE PLACE
WHEREIN HE BUILT HIGH PLACES, AND SET UP THE ASHERIM AND THE GRAVEN
IMAGES, BEFORE HE HUMBLED HIMSELF, BEHOLD THEY ARE WRITTEN IN THE BOOK
OF HOZEH <span id="fr_398"></span>[4](#fn_394.md)--showing that God
received his supplication and brought him to the life of the world to
come. T. XIII. 1. Those under age, <span id="fr_399"></span>[5](#fn_395.md)
the children of the

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

wicked in the land (of Israel) have no share in the world to come, for
it is written: BEHOLD, THE DAY COMETH, BURNING LIKE A FURNACE; AND ALL
THE PROUD AND ALL THAT WORK WICKEDNESS SHALL BE AS STUBBLE <span
id="fr_400"></span>[1](#fn_396.md)--so Rabban Gamaliel; but R. Jehoshua
says: They shall come to the world to come, for it says in one place,
THE LORD PRESERVETH THE SIMPLE; <span id="fr_401"></span>[2](#fn_397.md)
and in another, HEW DOWN THE TREE AND DESTROY IT, NEVERTHELESS LEAVE THE
STUMP OF THE ROOTS THEREOF IN THE EARTH. <span
id="fr_402"></span>[3](#fn_398.md) Rabban Gamaliel replied: I bring forward
on behalf of my view, HE SHALL LEAVE TO THEM NEITHER ROOT NOR
BRANCH; <span id="fr_403"></span>[4](#fn_399.md) which means that the
Almighty will not leave a meritorious deed, or parts of a meritorious
deed (to be rewarded in a future life) to them or to their fathers for
ever. And another explanation is; ROOT means the soul, and BRANCH means
the body.

2\. The children of the wicked among the heathen shall not live (in the
world to come), nor shall they be judged. But R. Eliezer holds: None of
the heathen has any share in the world to come, for it is written: THE
WICKED SHALL RETURN TO *SHEOL*, ALL THE HEATHEN THAT FORGET GOD. <span
id="fr_404"></span>[5](#fn_400.md) " THE WICKED SHALL RETURN TO
*SHEOL*,"--these are the wicked in Israel; "ALL THE HEATHEN THAT FORGET
GOD,"--these are the wicked among the heathen. R. Jehoshua said to him,
"If Scripture had said: THE WICKED SHALL RETURN TO SHEOL, ALL THE
HEATHEN, and then said no more, I should have spoken according to thy
words; but since Scripture says: WHO FORGET GOD, behold there must be
righteous men among the heathen who have a share in the world to come."

3\. The School of Shammai <span id="fr_405"></span>[6](#fn_401.md) say:
There are three classes; one for EVERLASTING LIFE, another for

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> SHAME AND
EVERLASTING CONTEMPT <span id="fr_406"></span>[1](#fn_402.md)--who are
accounted wholly wicked, and a third class who go down to Gehenna, where
they scream and again come up and receive healing, as it is written: AND
I WILL BRING THE THIRD PART THROUGH THE FIRE, AND WILL REFINE THEM AS
SILVER IS REFINED, AND WILL TRY THEM AS GOLD IS TRIED; AND THEY SHALL
CALL ON MY NAME AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD. <span
id="fr_407"></span>[2](#fn_403.md) And of these last Hannah said: THE LORD
KILLETH AND THE LORD MAKETH ALIVE, HE BRINGETH DOWN TO *SHEOL* AND
BRINGETH UP. <span id="fr_408"></span>[3](#fn_404.md)

The School of Hillel say: HE IS *GREAT* IN MERCY, <span
id="fr_409"></span>[4](#fn_405.md) that is, He leans in the direction of
mercy; and of them David said: I AM WELL PLEASED THAT THE LORD HATH
HEARD THE VOICE OF MY PRAYER, <span id="fr_410"></span>[5](#fn_406.md)
etc.; and of them, the whole psalm is written.

4\. The transgressors of Israel and the transgressors of the heathen who
are in the world go down to Gehenna with their bodies, and are judged
there for twelve months; after twelve months their souls are destroyed
and their bodies burnt; Gehenna casts them forth and they become dust;
the wind blows them about and scatters them under the soles of the feet
of the righteous, as it is written: AND YE SHALL TREAD DOWN THE WICKED,
FOR THEY SHALL BE DUST UNDER THE SOLES OF THE FEET OF THE RIGHTEOUS IN
THE DAY THAT I DO THIS, SAITH THE LORD OF HOSTS. <span
id="fr_411"></span>[6](#fn_407.md) But the heretics and renegades and
traitors and Epicureans, and those who denied the Law, or separated
themselves from the ways of the congregation, or denied the resurrection
of the dead, and all who sinned and caused the many to sin, like
Jeroboam and Ahab, and who set their dead in the land of the living, and
stretched

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

out their hands against the Temple, <span
id="fr_412"></span>[1](#fn_408.md) Gehenna is shut up after them, and they
are condemned in it for ever; for it is written: AND THEY SHALL GO FORTH
AND LOOK ON THE CORPSES OF THE MEN WHO WERE TRANSGRESSORS AGAINST ME,
FOR THEIR WORM DIETH NOT, AND THEIR FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED. AND THEY SHALL
BE AN ABHORRING UNTO ALL FLESH. <span id="fr_413"></span>[2](#fn_409.md)
*Sheol* wastes away, but they do not waste away, for it is written: AND
THEIR FORM SHALL CAUSE *SHEOL* TO PASS AWAY. <span
id="fr_414"></span>[3](#fn_410.md) What brought this upon them? Because
they stretched out their hands against the Temple, <span
id="fr_415"></span>[1](#fn_408.md) as it is written: BECAUSE OF HIS
TEMPLE; <span id="fr_416"></span>[1](#fn_408.md) and *ZEBUL* means nothing
else than "Temple," for it is written: I HAVE SURELY BUILT THEE A *BETH
ZEBUL*, A PLACE FOR THEE TO DWELL IN FOR EVER. <span
id="fr_417"></span>[4](#fn_411.md)

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>X. 3*a*. The Generation of the Flood
have no share in the world to come, nor shall they stand in the
judgment, for it is written: <span id="fr_418"></span>[5](#fn_412.md) My
SPIRIT SHALL NOT JUDGE <span id="fr_419"></span>[6](#fn_413.md) WITH MAN
FOR EVER. <span id="fr_420"></span>[7](#fn_414.md)

**T**. XIII. 6. The Generation of the Flood have no share in the world
to come, nor shall they live in the world to come, for it is written:
AND HE DESTROYED EVERY LIVING THING THAT WAS UPON THE FACE OF THE
EARTH, <span id="fr_421"></span>[8](#fn_415.md)--that is in this world;

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> AND THEY PERISHED
FROM THE EARTH,--that is in the world to come.

R. Jehuda, <span id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_416.md) the son of Bethyra,
says: AND THE LORD SAID, MY SPIRIT SHALL NOT JUDGE WITH MAN FOR
EVER; <span id="fr_423"></span>[2](#fn_417.md) that is, "There will be no
judgment, nor shall My spirit be in thee for ever."

Another explanation: AND THE LORD SAID: *LO YADON*. The Almighty says,
"I will not suffer their soul to return to its *case*." <span
id="fr_424"></span>[3](#fn_418.md)

R. Menahem, <span id="fr_425"></span>[4](#fn_419.md) the son of R. Jose
says: SHALL NOT JUDGE;--the Almighty means, "I shall not judge them when
I recompense a good reward to the righteous;" for the fate of the
spirits of the wicked is sorer than that of all others, for it is
written: THEIR SPIRIT IS A FIRE CONSUMING THEM. <span
id="fr_426"></span>[5](#fn_420.md)

7\. The Generation of the Tower of Babel have no share in the world to
come, nor shall they live in the world to come, for it is written: <span
id="fr_427"></span>[6](#fn_421.md) THEN THE LORD SCATTERED THEM ABROAD FROM
THENCE UPON THE FACE OF THE WHOLE EARTH,--that is, in this world; AND
THEY LEFT OFF TO BUILD THE CITY,--that is, in the world to come.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>X. 3*b*. The men of Sodom have no
share in the world to come, <span id="fr_428"></span>[7](#fn_422.md) but
they shall stand in the judgment, for it is written: AND THE MEN OF
SODOM WERE EVIL AND WICKED. <span id="fr_429"></span>[8](#fn_423.md) R.
Nehemia says, Neither the Generation of the Flood nor the men of Sodom
shall stand in the judgment, for it is

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>written: THEREFORE THE UNGODLY SHALL
NOT STAND IN THE JUDGMENT, <span id="fr_430"></span>[1](#fn_424.md)--this
is the Generation of the Flood; NOR THE EVIL IN THE CONGREGATION OF THE
RIGHTEOUS,--these are the men of Sodom. To this it was answered, "They
shall not stand in the congregation of the righteous, but they shall
stand in the congregation of the ungodly." <span
id="fr_431"></span>[2](#fn_425.md)

**T**. XIII. 8. The men of Sodom have no share in the world to come, nor
shall they live in the world to come, for it is written: AND THE MEN OF
SODOM WERE EVIL AND WICKED, <span id="fr_432"></span>[3](#fn_426.md)--m
this world; AGAINST THE LORD, EXCEEDINGLY,--in the world to come.

Another explanation: EVIL--each against his neighbour, AND WICKED--in
obscenity, AGAINST THE LORD--in idolatry, EXCEEDINGLY--in shedding
blood.

9*a*. The spies have no share in the world to come, for it is written:
NEITHER SHALL ANY OF THEM THAT DESPISED ME SEE IT. <span
id="fr_433"></span>[4](#fn_427.md)

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>X. 3*c*, The Generation of the
Wilderness have no share in the world to come, nor shall they stand in
the judgment, for it is written: THEY SHALL COME TO AN END IN THE
WILDERNESS AND THERE THEY SHALL DIE, <span
id="fr_434"></span>[5](#fn_428.md)--so R. Akiba; but

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span> R. Eleazar says, It is said of them: GATHER TOGETHER
MY HOLY ONES, WHO MADE A COVENANT WITH ME BY SACRIFICE. <span
id="fr_435"></span>[1](#fn_429.md)

The company of Korah are not destined to rise, for it is written: THE
EARTH COVERED THEM AND THEY PERISHED FROM THE CONGREGATION, <span
id="fr_436"></span>[2](#fn_430.md)--so R. Akiba; but R. Eleazar says, It is
said of them: THE LORD KILLETH AND MAKETH ALIVE, HE BRINGETH DOWN TO
*SHEOL* AND BRINGETH UP. <span id="fr_437"></span>[3](#fn_431.md)

**T**. XIII. 9b. Korah and his company have no share in the world to
come, nor shall they live in the world to come, for it is written: THE
EARTH COVERED THEM,--in this world; AND THEY PERISHED FROM THE
CONGREGATION,--in the world to come,--so R. Akiba; but R. Jehuda, the
son of Bethyra, says, They will reach the world to come, for of them it
is written: I HAVE GONE ASTRAY LIKE A PERISHING SHEEP; SEEK THY
SERVANT. <span id="fr_438"></span>[4](#fn_432.md) We find *perishing*
spoken of here, and also in the case of Korah and his company; as in the
*perishing* spoken of in the one place, that which is *perishing* is
being sought: so in the perishing spoken of in the other place, that
which is *perishing* is likewise being sought.

10\. The Generation of the Wilderness have no share in the world to
come, nor shall they live in the world to come, for it is written: OF
THEM I SWARE IN MY WRATH THAT THEY SHOULD NOT ENTER INTO MY REST, <span
id="fr_439"></span>[5](#fn_433.md)--SO R. Akiba; but R. Eleazar says, They
will reach the world to come, for of them David says: GATHER MY HOLY
ONES TOGETHER, THEY WHO MADE A COVENANT WITH ME BY SACRIFICE. <span
id="fr_440"></span>[6](#fn_434) (11.md) What does Scripture mean by "I
SWARE IN MY WRATH"? It was in my wrath that I

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

sware, but I am repenting. R. Jehoshua, the son of Karha, says, These
words were said concerning the future generations, for it is written:
GATHER MY HOLY ONES TOGETHER--because they did with me deeds of love;
THEY WHO MADE (*lit*. "cut") A COVENANT WITH ME--because they were cut
for my sake; WITH SACRIFICE--because they exalted me and were slain for
my sake.

R. Shimeon, the son of Menasia, says: The generation of the wilderness
will reach the world to come, for of them it is written: AND THE
REDEEMED OF THE LORD SHALL RETURN AND COME TO ZION WITH GLADNESS. <span
id="fr_441"></span>[1](#fn_435.md)

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>X. 3*d*. The Ten Tribes are not to
return, for it is written: AND HE CAST THEM FORTH INTO ANOTHER LAND LIKE
(AS TO) THIS DAY. <span id="fr_442"></span>[2](#fn_436.md) As a day goes
and does not return, so they go and do not return,--so R. Akiba; but R.
Eleazar says, "As a day darkens and then becomes light, so they, after
being in darkness, shall then have light."

**T**. XIII. 12. The Ten Tribes have no share in the world to come, nor
shall they live in the world to come, for it is written: AND THE LORD
DROVE THEM OUT FROM THEIR LAND WITH ANGER AND HEAT AND GREAT WRATH,--In
this world; AND CAST THEM FORTH UNTO ANOTHER LAND,--in the world to
come. R. Shimeon, the son of Jehuda, of Kephar-Akkos, says: It is
likewise written, LIKE (AS AT) THIS DAY; therefore if their deeds are
"like as at this day," they will not reach the world to come; but if
they are not, they will reach it.

Rabbi says, Both of them shall have a share in

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

the world to come, for it is written: AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS IN THAT
DAY THAT THOSE WHO ARE PERISHING IN THE LAND OF ASSHUR, AND THOSE WHO
ARE DRIVEN AWAY INTO THE LAND OF EGYPT, SHALL COME AND WORSHIP THE LORD
IN THE HOLY MOUNTAIN IN JERUSALEM. <span

<span id="fn_384"></span>[120:2](tsa37.htm#fr_388.md) Most codices,

it is written, And thy people are all of them righteous; they shall
inherit the earth for ever" (Isa. 60. 21).

<span id="fn_385"></span>[120:3](tsa37.htm#fr_389.md) Cf. Mark. 12. 18;
Acts 23. 8.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[120:4](tsa37.htm#fr_390.md) An epithet constantly
applied to those, Jews and Gentiles alike, who come into opposition with
Rabbinical standpoints. The word probably owes its popularity and
frequency as a term of abuse, not to a widespread knowledge and practice
of Epicurean teachings, so much as to the word-play on the root *paḳar*,
"be free from restraint, licentious, sceptical."

<span id="fn_387"></span>[120:5](tsa37.htm#fr_391.md) Books excluded from
the Hebrew Canon; in spite of R. Akiba's dictum, Ben Sira is sometimes
quoted in Talmud and other rabbinical literature.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[124:6](tsa37.htm#fr_419.md) *Lo yadon*,--the
meaning is uncertain. It is here given a double meaning, "shall not
judge" and "shall not continue"; therefore if God's spirit does not
continue in them for ever, they can have no life hereafter. Editions
based on the Bomberg text add the explanatory gloss, "Neither judgment
nor spirit."

<span id="fn_414"></span>[124:7](tsa37.htm#fr_420.md) Bomberg text adds the
paragraph: The Generation of the Dispersion (Gen. 11. 8-9) have no share
in the world to come, as it is written: "And God scattered them
abroad,"--in this world, "and from thence God scattered them
abroad,"--in the world to come.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[125:7](tsa37.htm#fr_428.md) Bomberg text adds: As
it is written \[Gen. 13. 13\]: "And the men of Sodom were evil and
wicked exceedingly in the sight of the Lord,"--*evil* in this world, and
*wicked* with respect to the world to come.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[125:8](tsa37.htm#fr_429.md) Gen. 13. 13. C by
error repeats quotation from Gen, 6. 3.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[126:1](tsa37.htm#fr_430.md) Psalm 1. 5.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[126:2](tsa37.htm#fr_431.md) That is, they shall
stand in the judgment. The men of Sodom are called *evil*, hence they
cannot be among the "congregation of the righteous," *i.e.* in the world
to come; yet they are not called *ungodly* (*rashā‘im*), but only
*wicked* (*rā‘im*): therefore Psalm 1. 5 does not exclude them from the
judgment.

Bomberg text adds: The spies have no share in the world to come, as it
is written (Numb. 14. 37): "And the men who brought an evil report of
the land died by the plague before the Lord." *They died*--in this
world; *by the plague*--in the world to come.
