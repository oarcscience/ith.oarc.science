### Vay’hi Baḥatzi Halay'loh

"<span class="smallcaps">and it came to pass at midnight</span>."

<span class="small">All read the third line of each stanza in
unison.</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Unto God let praise be brought  
For the wonders He hath wrought—  
  At the solemn hour of midnight.

All the earth was sunk in night  
When God said "Let there be light!"  
  Thus the day was formed from midnight.

So was primal man redeemed  
When the light of reason gleamed  
  Through the darkness of the midnight.

To the Patriarch, God revealed  
The true faith, so long concealed  
  By the darkness of the midnight.

But this truth was long obscured  
By the slavery endured  
  In the black Egyptian midnight.

Till the messengers of light  
Sent by God, dispelled the night,  
  And it came to pass at midnight. <span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

Then the people God had freed  
Pledged themselves His law to heed,  
  And it came to pass at midnight.

When they wandered from the path  
Of the Lord, His righteous wrath  
  Hurled them into darkest midnight.

But the prophets’ burning word  
By repentant sinners heard  
  Called them back from darkest midnight.

God a second time decreed  
That His people should be freed  
  From the blackness of the midnight.

Songs of praise to God ascend,  
Festive lights their glory lend  
  To illuminate the midnight.

Soon the night of exile falls  
And within the Ghetto walls  
  Israel groans in dreary midnight.

Anxiously with God they plead,  
Who still trust His help in need,  
In the darkest hour of midnight.

And He hears their piteous cry.  
"Wait! be strong, My help is nigh,  
  Soon ‘twill pass—the long-drawn midnight.

"Tenderly I cherished you  
For a service great and true;  
  When ‘tis past—the long-drawn midnight." <span id="page_117">p.
117</span>

O, Thou Guardian of the Right,  
Lead us onward to the light  
  From the darkness of the midnight.

Father, let the day appear  
When all men Thy name revere  
  And Thy light dispels the midnight.

When no longer shall the foe  
From th’ oppressed wring cries of woe  
  In the darkness of the midnight.

But Thy love all hearts shall sway;  
And Thy light drive gloom away,  
  And to midday change the midnight.
