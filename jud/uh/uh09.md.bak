### Kiddush

On Sabbath eve begin here.

The master of the house lifts up the wine-cup and says:

LET US praise God and thank Him for all the blessings of the week that
is gone; for life, health and strength; for home, love and friendship;
for the discipline of our trials and temptations; for the happiness of
our success and prosperity. Thou hast ennobled us, O God, by the
blessings of work, and in love and grace sanctified us by the blessings
of rest, through the commandment, "Six days shalt thou labor and do all
thy work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath unto the Lord thy God".

<span class="small">On weeks days begin here.</span>

With song and praise, and with the symbols of our feast, let us renew
the memories of our past.

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast chosen
us from all peoples and exalted anti sanctified us with Thy
commandments. In love hast Thou given us, O Lord our God, solemn days of
joy and festive seasons of gladness, even this day of the Feast of
Unleavened Bread, a holy convocation unto us, a memorial of the
departure from Egypt. Thou hast chosen us for Thy service and

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span> <span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

hast made us sharers in the blessings of Thy holy festivals. Blessed art
Thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest Israel and the festive seasons.

<span class="small">All read in unison:</span>

BORUCH ATTO ADONOI ELOHENU MELECH HO‘OLOM BORE P’RI HAGGOFEN.

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, Ruler of the world, who hast created
the fruit of the vine.

<span class="small">Drink the first cup of wine.</span>

#### 2. ‏כַּרְפַּס‎

Some parsley, lettuce or watercress is distributed to all present who
dip it in salt water or in vinegar, and before partaking of it say in
unison:

BORUCH ATTO ADONOI ELOHENU MELECH HO‘OLOM BORE P’RI HO’ADOMO.

Praised art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Creator of the
fruit of the earth.

#### 3. ‏יַֽחַץ‎

The leader breaks the middle Matzo, leaving one half on the Seder-dish,
and hiding the other half as the Aphikomon to be eaten at the end of the
meal.

#### 4. ‏מַגִּיר‎

<span class="small">The leader lifts up the Matzos and says:</span>

Lo! This is the bread of affliction which our fathers ate in the land of
Egypt. Let all who are hungry come and eat. Let all who are in want come
and celebrate the Passover with us. May it be God's will to redeem us
from all trouble and from all servitude. Next year at this season, may
the whole house of Israel be free!
