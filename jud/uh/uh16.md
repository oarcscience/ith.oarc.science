HALLELUJAH.

Praise, O ye servants of the Lord,  
Praise the name of the Lord.

<span class="small">*Company:*</span>

Blessed be the name of the Lord  
From this time forth and for ever.

<span class="small">*Leader:*</span>

From the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof  
The Lord's name is to be praised.

<span class="small">*Company:*</span>

The Lord is high above all nations,  
His glory is above the heavens.

<span class="small">*Leader:*</span>

Who is like unto the Lord our God,  
That is enthroned on high,

<span class="small">*Company:*</span>

That looketh down low  
Upon heaven and upon earth?

<span class="small">*Leader:*</span>

Who raiseth up the poor out of the dust,  
And lifteth up the needy out of the dunghill;

<span class="small">*Company:*</span>

That He may set him with princes,  
Even with the princes of His people.

<span class="small">*Leader:*</span>

Who maketh the barren woman to dwell in her house  
As a joyful mother of children.

<span class="small">*Company:*</span>

Hallelujah.

<span class="small"><span class="small">PSALM CXIV</span></span>

<span class="small">*Leader:*</span>

WHEN Israel came forth out of Egypt,  
The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;

<span class="small">*Company:*</span>

Judah became His sanctuary,  
Israel His dominion.

<span class="small">*Leader:*</span>

The sea saw it, and fled;  
The Jordan turned backward.

<span class="small">*Company:*</span>

The mountains skipped like rams,  
The hills like young sheep,

<span class="small">*Leader:*</span>

What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest?  
Thou Jordan, that thou turnest backward?

<span class="small">*Company:*</span>

Ye mountains that ye skip like rams;  
Ye hills, like young sheep?

<span class="small">*Leader:*</span>

Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord,  
At the presence of the God of Jacob;

<span class="small">*Company:*</span>

Who turned the rock into a pool of water,  
The flint into a fountain of waters.
