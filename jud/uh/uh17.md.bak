PRAISED art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
redeemed us and our ancestors from Egypt, and hast enabled us to observe
this night of the Passover, the Feast of Unleavened Bread. O Lord our
God and God of our fathers, may we, with Thy help, live to celebrate
other feasts and holy seasons. May we rejoice in Thy salvation and be
gladdened by Thy righteousness. Grant deliverance to mankind through
Israel, Thy people. May Thy will be done through Jacob, Thy chosen
servant, so that Thy name shall be sanctified in the midst of all the
earth, and that all peoples be moved to worship Thee with one accord.
And we shall sing new songs of praise unto Thee, for our redemption and
for the deliverance of our souls. Praised art Thou, O God, Redeemer of
Israel.

the fruit of the vine.

#### 5. ‏מוֹצִיא, מַצָּה‎

#### 6. ‏כּוֹרֵךְ מָרוֹר‎

<span class="small">Each person receives some bitter herbs and ḥaroses,
which he places between two pieces of matzo. The leader then
reads:</span>

This was the practice of Hillel, at the time the Temple was still in
existence. He combined the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs and ate
them together, to carry out the injunction concerning the Passover
sacrifice: "With unleavened bread and with bitter herbs, they shall eat
it."
