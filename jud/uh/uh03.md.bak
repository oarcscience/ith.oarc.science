### The Seder—A Foreword

Among the ceremonials which nurtured the Jewish idealism of generations,
a place of peculiar charm is held by the <span
class="smallcaps">Seder</span>, celebrated on the Passover Eve, and
repeated on the following night by those who observe the second days of
festivals. Literally, the name means <span class="smallcaps">the
Order</span> of the service. The ritual provided for the service is
known as the <span class="smallcaps">Haggadah</span>, that is, <span
class="smallcaps">the Narrative</span> of the Passover. The ceremony
grows out of the several injunctions in the Pentateuch for the Israelite
<span class="smallcaps">to Relate</span> to his children the story of
the Exodus from Egypt, and to explain to them the meaning of the rites
and symbols connected with the celebration of the Passover.

In the Seder are blended, in happy combination, the influences which
have contributed so much toward inspiring our people, though scattered
throughout the world, with a genuine feeling of kinship. Year after
year, the Seder has thrilled them with an appreciation of the glories of
their past, imbued them with an heroic power of endurance under the
severest trials and persecutions, and quickened within them the
enthusiasm of high ideals of freedom.

It has helped to forge "not easily dissoluble links" between the
individual and the Jewish people. In his tribute to the poetic beauty of
the Seder, Heinrich Heine expressed a sentiment, evidently founded on
his personal experience: "It thrills the heart as though one heard the
lilt of some sweet lullaby. Even those Jews who have fallen away from
the faith of their fathers in the mad pursuit of other joys and other
glories are moved to the very depths of their being when by chance they
hear again the old Passover melodies once so dear to them."
