# CHAPTER VIII

### THE SOUL

As in all systems of mysticism, the soul plays a towering part in the
theology of the *Zohar*. Mysticism's centre of gravity is the close
kinship between the human and the Divine; and the only avenue through
which this kinship can become real to us is the soul. The soul, as a
spiritual entity playing the highest of high parts in man's relation
with the Unseen, is not a conspicuous element of either the Old
Testament or the Talmudic-Midrashic writings; and the critics of Judaism
have a way of saying harsh things about that religion on the grounds of
its deficiency in this respect. But the shortcoming is amply atoned for
by the large part assigned to the function of the soul in all branches
of the mediæval Kabbalah.

That the *Zohar* is a debtor to a double source--the Talmudic teachings
and the teachings of the Neoplatonists--is very apparent from its
treatment of the soul. A passage from the former reads as follows: "Just
as the soul fills the body, so God

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

fills the world. Just as the soul bears the body, so God endures the
world. Just as the soul sees but is not seen, so God sees but is not
seen. Just as the soul feeds the body \[*i.e.* spiritually,
intellectually\], so God gives food to the world" (*T.B. Berachoth*,
10a). The predominant influence of the soul over the body, the body as
overflown in all its parts by the soul and dependent upon it for the
source of its life--these are the implications of the passage just
quoted; and they are the substratum of the Zoharic ideas of the soul.

Neoplatonism gave to the *Zohar* the idea of the soul as an emanation
from the 'Overmind' of the universe. There was originally one 'Universal
Soul,' or 'Over-soul,' which, as it were, broke itself up and encased
itself in individual bodies. All individual souls are, hence, fragments
of the 'Oversoul,' so that although they are distinct from one another
they are, in reality, all *one*. Thus, to quote the *Zohar*:

"At the time when God desired to create the universe, it came up in His
will before Him, and He formed all the souls which were destined to be
allotted to the children of men. The souls were all before Him in the
forms which they were afterwards destined to bear inside the human body.
God looked at each one of them, and He saw that many of them would act
corruptly

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

in the world. When the time of each arrived, it was summoned before God,
who said to it: 'Go to such and such a part of the universe, enclose
thyself in such and such a body.' But the soul replied: 'O sovereign of
the universe, I am happy in my present world, and I desire not to leave
it for some other place where I shall be enslaved and become soiled.'
Then the Holy One (blessed be He) replied: 'From the day of thy creation
thou hast had no other destiny than to go into the universe whither I
send thee.' The soul, seeing that it must obey, sorrowfully took the way
to earth and came down to dwell in our midst" (ii. 96).

There is more than one echo of Plotinus--the master-mind of
Neoplatonism--in this Zoharic extract. 'The world coming up in His will
before Him' is Plotinus’ teaching about God thinking out the original
patterns of all things, the first manifestation of God being Thought.
'The souls were all before Him in the forms which they were after-wards
destined to bear' is clearly an allusion to the splitting-up of the
Oversoul, so that its fragments might get embodied in individuals--as
Plotinus taught. But although the *Zohar*, like Plotinus, draws a
distinction between *lower* souls ('they who would act corruptly in the
world') and higher souls, it, unlike Plotinus, makes every soul descend

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

into some body. Plotinus has quite a different teaching.

"The lower soul desires a body and lives in the stage of sense. . . .
The higher soul, on the other hand, transcends the body, 'rides upon
it,' as the fish is in the sea or as the plant is in the air. This
higher soul never absolutely leaves its home, its being is not here but
'yonder,' or, in the language of Plotinus, 'The soul always leaves
something of itself above'" (Rufus M. Jones, *Studies in Mystical
Religion*, p. 74).

According to the *Zohar*, while there are distinctions there, too,
between superior and inferior souls--as is shown by their belonging to a
higher or lower Sefirah--they must all descend to earth and unite with
the body, returning, all of them, at death to their fountain-head, God.

The *Zohar* is, after all, but a commentary on the Hebrew Bible, and
however much it may, at times, forsake the traditional Jewish pathways
in favour of alien philosophies, it is always strictly conservative
where the fundamental axioms of the Jewish faith are concerned. That
every body possesses a soul which in its pristine form is 'pure,' that
recompense in an after-life awaits it on a scale commensurate with its
deserts, is an impregnable tenet of Judaism. The *Zohar*, wherever it
may wander, must come back to this central point.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

The soul is a trinity. It comprises three elements, *viz*.: (*a*)
*Neshāmāh*, the rational element which is the highest phase of
existence; (*b*) *Ruaḥ*, the moral element, the seat of good and evil,
the ethical qualities; (*c*) *Nefesh*, the gross side of spirit, the
vital element which is *en rapport* with the body, and the mainspring of
all the movements, instincts, and cravings of the physical life.

There is a strong reflection of Platonic psychology in these three
divisions or powers of the soul. More than one mediæval Jewish
theologian was a Platonist, and in all probability the *Zohar* is a
debtor to these. The three divisions of the soul are emanations from the
Sefirot. The *Neshāmāh*, which, as has been said, is the soul in its
most elevated and sublimest sense, emanates from the Sefirah of Wisdom.
The *Ruaḥ*, which denotes the soul in its ethical aspect, emanates from
the Sefirah of Beauty. The *Nefesh*, which is the animal side of the
soul, is an emanation from the Sefirah of Foundation, that element of
divinity which comes, most of all, into contact with the material forces
of earth.

To sum up the matter in general and untechnical language, the three
divisions or aspects of the human soul enable man to fit himself into
the plan and framework of the cosmos, give him the power to do his

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

multifarious duties towards the multifarious portions of the world,--the
world which is a manifestation of God's thought, a copy of the celestial
universe, an emanation of the Divine. The *Zohar* puts it poetically
thus:

"In these three \[*i.e.* *Neshāmāh*, *Ruaḥ*, *Nefesh*\] we find an exact
image (*diyūkna*) of what is above in the celestial world. For *all
three* form only *one* soul, one being, where all is *one*. The *Nefesh*
\[*i.e.* the lowest side of soul\] does not in itself possess any light.
This is why it is so tightly joined to the body, acquiring for it the
pleasures and the foods which it needs. It is of it that the sage says,
'She giveth meat to her household and their task to her maidens'
(*Proverbs*, xxxi. 15). 'Her household' means the body which is fed.
'Her maidens' are the limbs which obey the dictates of the body. Above
the *Nefesh* is the *Ruaḥ* \[the ethical soul\] which dominates the
*Nefesh*, imposes laws upon it and enlightens it as much as its nature
requires. And then high above the *Ruaḥ* is the *Neshāmāh*, which in its
turn rules the *Ruaḥ* and sheds upon it the light of life. The *Ruaḥ* is
lit up by this light, and depends entirely upon it. After death, the
*Ruaḥ* has no rest. The gates of Paradise (*Eden*) are not opened to it
until the time when *Neshāmāh* has reascended to its source, to the
Ancient of the ancients, in order to become filled with Him throughout
eternity.

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For the *Neshāmāh*
is always climbing back again towards its source" (ii. 142).

It can be gathered from this passage, as from many similar ones which
might have been usefully quoted had space allowed, that *Neshāmāh* is
only realised, that man only becomes conscious of *Neshāmāh*, after
death. A whole lifetime is necessary (and in some cases more than one
lifetime, as we shall see) in order that *Neshāmāh* should be able to
mount up again to the Infinite source from which it emanated. And it is
the inevitable destiny of *Neshāmāh* to climb back and become one with
the 'Ancient of ancients.'

But if *Neshāmāh* is so exalted, so sacrosanct, why should it have
emanated from its immaculate source at all, to become tainted with
earth? The *Zohar* anticipates our question and gives its answer as
follows:

"If thou inquirest why it \[*i.e.*. the soul\] cometh down into the
world from so exalted a place and putteth itself at such a distance from
its source, I reply thus: It may be likened to an earthly monarch to
whom a son is born. The monarch takes the son to the countryside, there
to be nourished and trained until such a time as he is old enough to
accustom himself to the palace of his father. When the father is told
that the education of his son is completed, what does he do out of his
love for him? In order

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

to celebrate his home-coming, he sends for the queen, the mother of the
lad. He brings her into the palace and rejoices with her the whole day
long.

"It is thus with the Holy One (blessed be He). He, too, has a son by the
queen. This son is the high and holy soul. He conducts it to the
countryside, *i.e.* to the world, in order to grow up there and gain an
acquaintance with the customs appertaining to the royal palace. When the
Divine King perceives that the soul has completed its growth, and the
time is ripe for recalling it to Himself, what does He do out of His
love for it? He sends for the queen, brings her into the palace, and
brings the soul in too. The soul, forsooth, does not bid adieu to its
earthly tenement before the queen has come to unite herself with it, and
to lead it into the royal apartment where it is to live for ever.

"And the people of the world are wont to weep when the son \[*i.e.* the
soul\] takes its leave of them. But if there be a wise man amongst them,
he says to them, Why weep ye? Is he not the son of the King? Is it not
meet that he should take leave of you to live in the palace of his
father? It was for this reason that Moses, who knew the Truth, on seeing
the inhabitants of earth mourning for the dead, exclaimed, 'Ye are the
children of the Lord your God; ye shall not cut yourselves, nor make any

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

baldness between your eyes for the dead' (*Deut*. xiv. 1). If all good
men knew this, they would hail with delight the day when it behoves them
to bid adieu to the world. Is it not the height of glory for them when
the queen \[*i.e.* the Shechinah, the Divine Presence\] comes down into
the midst of them to lead them into the palace of the king to enjoy the
delights thereof for ever-more?" (i. 245).

It should be noted, by the way, that there are many instances in
Talmudic literature, of men seeing the Shechinah at the hour of death.
It is the signal of the return of *Neshāmāh* to its home, the Oversoul,
of which it is but a loosened fragment; and the return can only begin
after it has completed its education within the life-limits of an
earthly body.

It seems to follow, as a necessary corollary from the foregoing
doctrine, that the *Zohar* must give countenance to some theory of the
transmigration of souls. If it is imperative upon *Neshāmāh* to climb
back again to the Oversoul and obtain union with it; and if, in order to
effect this end, it must previously have reached the summit of purity
and perfection, then it stands to reason that its sojourn within the
confines of one body may, on occasions, be inadequate to enable it to
reach this high and exacting condition. Hence it must 'experience' other
bodies,

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

and it must repeat the 'experience' until such a time as it shall have
elevated and refined itself to the pitch at which it will be able to
become one again with the fountain from which it emanated. The *Zohar*
does contain some such tenet as this, although for the full and
systematic treatment of the subject one has to look to the Kabbalistic
writers who built upon the *Zohar*. The *Zohar* states as follows:

"All souls must undergo transmigration; and men do not understand the
ways of the Holy One (blessed be He). They know not that they are
brought before the tribunal both before they enter into this world and
after they leave it. They know not the many transmigrations and hidden
trials which they have to undergo, nor do they know the number of souls
and spirits (*Ruaḥ* and *Nefesh*) which enter into the world, and which
do not return to the Palace of the Heavenly King. Men do not know how
the souls revolve like a stone which is thrown from a sling. But the
time is drawing nigh when these hidden things will be revealed" (ii.
99).

To the minds of the Kabbalists, transmigration is a necessity not alone
on the grounds of their particular theology--the soul must reach the
highest stage of its evolution before it can be received again into its
eternal home--but on moral grounds as well. It is a vindication of
Divine justice to

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

mankind. It settles the harassing query which all ages have propounded:
Why does God permit the wicked to flourish as the green bay tree,
whereas the righteous man is allowed to reap nothing but sorrow and
failure? And the only way for reconciling the dismal fact of
child-suffering with the belief in a good God, is by saying that the
pain is a retribution to the soul for sin committed in some one or more
of its previous states. As has been already mentioned, the Jewish
literature of this subject of transmigration is an exceedingly rich one.
But it lies outside the scope of the present book.

Not only does the *Zohar*, as we have seen, teach the emanation of a
threefold soul, but it also propounds a curious theory about the
emanation of a pre-existent form or type of body, which, in the case of
each one of us, unites the soul with the body. It is one of the
strangest pieces of Zoharic psychology extant; and the object is
probably that of accounting, on one and the same ground, for the varying
physical and psychical characteristics embedded in each of us from
birth. The passage runs as follows:

"At the moment when the earthly union \[*i.e.* marriage\] takes place,
the Holy One (blessed be He) sends to earth a form \[or image\]
resembling a man, and bearing upon itself the divine seal. This image is
present at the moment just mentioned, and if the eye

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

could see what goes on then, it would detect above the heads \[of man
and wife\] an image like a human face, and this image is the model after
which we are fashioned. . . . It is this image which receives us first
on our arrival into this world. It grows in us as we grow, and leaves us
when we leave the world. *This image is from above*. When the souls are
about to quit their heavenly abode each soul appears before the Holy One
(blessed be He) clothed with an exalted pattern \[or image or form\] on
which are engraven the features which it will bear here below" (iii.
107).

But of far greater consequence in the history of Jewish mysticism is the
commanding place assigned by the *Zohar* to the idea of Love. Indeed,
Jewish mysticism is here but a reflection of the nature of the mysticism
inherent in all other creeds. The soul's most visible, most tangible,
most perceivable quality is love. The soul is the root of love. Love is
the symbol of the soul. "Mystic Love," says Miss Underhill, "is the
offspring of the Celestial Venus; the deep-seated desire and tendency of
the soul towards its source." The soul, says the mystic of all ages,
seeks to enter consciously into the Presence of God. It can do so only
under the spur of an overpowering ecstatic emotion called love.
Although, according to the *Zohar*, the soul in its most exalted state
as *Neshāmāh* can only enjoy the love inherent

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

in its union with its source after it has freed itself from the
contamination of earthly bodies, it is nevertheless possible, under
certain conditions, to realise this ecstatic love while the soul is in
the living body of an individual. One of these conditions is *the act of
serving* God, the chief outward concomitant of which is *prayer*.

"Whosoever serves God out of love," says the *Zohar*, "comes into union
(*itdaḅak*) with the place of the Highest of the High, and comes into
union, too, with the holiness of the world which is to be" (ii. 216).
This is to say that the service of God, when effected with love, leads
the soul into union with the place of its origin, and it gives it, as it
were, a foretaste of the ineffable felicity which awaits it in its
highest condition as *Neshāmāh*.

The verse "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God the Lord is One" (*Deut*.
vi. 4) hints, says the *Zohar*, at this blending of the soul into a
Unity. For this branch of its teaching the *Zohar* is certainly not
indebted to Neoplatonism or any other alien system. It got it from its
Jewish predecessors--the Midrashic homilists who enriched the Jewish
literature of the opening centuries of the Christian era with their
mystic interpretations of the *Song of Songs*. Verses like "I am my
beloved's, and my beloved is mine" (vi. 3) served them as a
starting-point for their sermons on the nearness of man and God to

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

one another, brought about by the instrumentality of love.

When the soul has completed the cycle of its earthly career and hurries
back to become blended with the Oversoul, it revels in ecstasies of
love, which the *Zohar* describes with a wealth of poetic phraseology.
The soul is received in what is termed a 'treasury of life,' or
sometimes a 'temple of love,' and one of its crowning joys is to
contemplate the Divine Presence through a 'shining mirror.' The Rabbis
of the Talmud and Midrashim used the same phrase. Thus a passage in
*Leviticus Rabba*, i. 14, reads thus: "All the other prophets saw God
through nine shining mirrors, but Moses saw Him through only one. All
the other prophets saw God through a blurred mirror, but Moses saw Him
through a clear one." The meaning is that Moses had a clearer and nearer
apprehension of the Deity than all other prophets.

Thus we read: "Come and see! When the souls have reached the treasury of
life they enjoy the shining of the brilliant mirror whose focus is in
the heavens. And such is the brightness which emanates therefrom that
the souls would be unable to withstand it, were they not covered with a
coat of light. Even Moses could not approach it until he had stripped
off his earthly integument" (i. 66). Again: "In one of the most
mysterious and exalted parts of heaven, there is a

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

palace called the Palace of Love. Deep mysteries are enacted there;
there are gathered together all the most well-beloved souls of the
Heavenly King; it is there that the Heavenly King, the Holy One (blessed
be He), lives together with these holy souls and unites Himself to them
by kisses of love" (ii. 97).

The Talmudic Rabbis described the way in which death comes to the
righteous as 'death by a kiss.' The *Zohar* defines this 'kiss' as 'the
union of the soul with its root' (i. 168). There is, in fine, an
exceptionally high degree of optimism encircling the *Zohar's* treatment
of the soul.

If the theology of the early Rabbinic schools of Palestine and Babylon
errs, as its critics say, in the direction of making Judaism too much of
a rigid discipline, too much of a law-compelling, outward obedience
rather than inward feeling, the balance is redressed by the theology of
the *Zohar* which, by making the soul, on the completion of its earthly
work, so great a partaker in the Divine love, emphasises the deep
spirituality inherent in Judaism, the emotional element which it calls
forth in those who rightfully and adequately put its teachings into
practice. It thus imports an added brightness into Jewish life. It
inspires the Jew with the conviction that a high destiny awaits him in
the hereafter. It makes him

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

put a premium upon virtue, and encourages him to raise himself to the
sublimest pitch of moral and religious worth. Judaism for the Jew can
never be a mere soulless formalism so long as the *Zohar's* doctrine of
Divine love is an integral part of Judaism. Such a consummation is well
attested by such a passage from the *Zohar* as the following .

"When Adam our first father dwelt in the garden of Eden he was clothed,
as men are in heaven, with the Divine light. When he was driven forth
from Eden to do the ordinary work of earth, then Holy Writ tells us that
'the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skin and clothed
them.' For, ere this, they wore coats of light, of that light which
belongs to Eden. <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md) Man's good deeds
upon earth bring down on him a portion of the higher light which lights
up heaven. It is that light which covers him like a coat when he enters
into the future world and appears before his Maker, the Holy One
(blessed be He). It is by means of such a covering that he can taste of
the enjoyments of the elect and look upon the face of the 'shining
mirror.' And thus, the soul, in order to become perfect in all respects,
must have a different covering for each of the two

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

worlds which it has to inhabit, one for the terrestrial world and the
other for the higher world" (ii. 229).

And this cheerful view of the soul is an incitement to nobler effort,
not only for the Jew as an individual, but also for the Jew as a unit of
a race which, according to Scriptural prescription, looks forward to its
highest evolution in the arrival of a Messiah. The *Zohar*, truly
enough, is comparatively silent upon this theme. But the famous
Kabbalist and mystic Isaac Luria, who is the chief expounder of the
*Zohar*, and who carried many of its undeveloped dogmas to their logical
conclusions, has elaborated this point in a strikingly ingenious and
original way. Luria held a peculiar theory of the transmigration of the
soul; and conjoined with this there went, what might appear to some, an
approach to Christian teaching about the truth of original sin. With the
*Zohar*, Luria maintained that man, by means of his soul, unites the
upper and the lower world. But he maintained further that with the
creation of Adam there were created at the same time all the souls of
all races of mankind. Just as there are variations in the physical
qualities of men, so there are corresponding variations in their souls.
Hence there are souls which are good and souls which are bad and souls
of all the shades of value which lie between these two extremes.

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When Adam sinned
there was confusion in all these classes of souls. The good souls became
tainted with some of the evil inherent in the bad souls, and, on the
contrary, the bad souls received many an admixture of goodness from the
superior souls.

But who emanated from the inferior sets of soul? According to Luria, the
pagan world. Israel, however, issued from the superior souls. But,
again, seeing that the good souls are not wholly good nor the bad souls
wholly bad by reason of the confusion ensuing upon Adam's fall, it
follows that there can be no real unalloyed good in the world. Evil
infests some spot or other everywhere. A perfect condition of things
will only come with the coming of the Messiah. Until that time,
therefore, all souls, tainted as they all inevitably are with sin, must,
by means of a chain of transmigrations from one body to another, shake
off more and more of the dross clinging to them, until they reach that
summit of purity and perfection when, as *Neshāmāh*, they can find their
way back to unite with the Infinite Source, the Oversoul. Hence the
individual Jew in promoting the growth of his own soul is really
promoting the collective welfare of his race. Upon the weal or woe of
his own soul hangs the weal or woe of his people.

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

Luria's arguments, when fully stated, have a decided air of the
fantastic about them. But that his conclusion is sound and valuable, no
one will doubt. He encourages the Jew to the pursuit of a lofty communal
or national ideal. He reminds him, too, of the imperative necessity of
Israel's solidarity. For the Jew, taking his stand upon many a text in
the Old Testament, has always felt that his thought and his work must
not be for himself alone. His prayer has ever been for the well-being of
Israel rather than for the well-being of individual Israelites. What he
counts, in God's sight, as a separate entity is small in comparison with
what he counts as an inseparable unit in the compact body of Israel. In
this voluntary, self-forgetful merging of the smaller interests of the
part in the greater interests of the whole lies much of the secret of
the long roll of Israel's saints and heroes, his martyrs and his
mystics.
