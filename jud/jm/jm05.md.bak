# CHAPTER I

### SOME EARLY ELEMENTS: ESSENISM

THE Old Testament is the fountain-head of Judaism. Hence if it is true,
as is contended in a previous page, that the Old Testament contains
mystical elements, then the starting-point in any treatment of Jewish
mysticism on historical, or even semi-historical, lines must be the Old
Testament. But this course will not be adopted here. The Old Testament
will be omitted. And for a reason which has already been hinted. The
mysticism of the Old Testament is of an elementary, naïve, and
unconscious kind, whereas what this book is intended to show is the
consciously-elaborated, professional mysticism of the Jews. What we get
in the Old Testament are the ground-work and the scaffolding, the
indispensable beginnings of the edifice; but not the edifice itself.

Thus it has much to say about the Fatherhood of God. Here we have a
basic conception of all mysticism; for the latter in all its phases and
stages assumes the possibility of communion with some one who, while

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

greater and more powerful than ourselves, is at the same time loving,
and benevolent, and personally interested in us. You can only pray to
one who hears; you can only feel love towards one who, you know, has
loved you first. The Old Testament scintillates with sublime examples of
men whose communion with God was a thing of intensest reality to them,
and whose conviction of the 'nearness' of the Divine was beyond the
slightest cavil. The sudden and unexpected inrushes of Divine
inspiration which seized the Old Testament prophets; Isaiah's vision of
a God 'whose train filled the Temple'--an emblem of the
All-inclusiveness of Deity, of the presence and the working of an
all-embracing Spirit of Life; the ecstasy of an Ezekiel lifted from off
his feet by the Spirit and removed from one place to another; the fact
of prophecy itself--the possession of a spiritual endowment not
vouchsafed to ordinary men, the endowment of a higher insight into the
will of God;--all these represent a stage of first-hand, living religion
to which the name of mysticism is rightly and properly applied. But they
are no more than the preamble to the explicit, conscious, and
pronouncedly personal type of Jewish mysticism which is the subject of
the present book.

The earliest beginnings of this mysticism are usually accredited, by
modern Jewish

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

scholars, to the Essenes. To say this, is to put back Jewish mysticism
to a very early date, for according to the theory of Wellhausen
(*Israëlitische and jüdische Geschichte*, 1894, p. 261), the Essenes as
well as the Pharisees were offshoots of the Ḥasidim (חסידים = 'pious
ones') of the pre-Maccabean age. But it is only a theory, and not an
established historical fact, seeing that the religious tenets of the
Jews during the three centuries immediately preceding the birth of
Christianity are veiled in considerable obscurity, and seeing also that
the real meaning of the name 'Essenes' as well as their exact relations
with the Pharisees are points upon which there is anything but
certainty. 'What is certain, however, is that three out-standing
literary sources belonging to the first two or three Christian
centuries--*viz*. (*a*) Philo, (*b*) Josephus, (*c*) some older portions
of the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds--all have stray allusions,
couched in varying phraseology, to certain sects or parties who differed
in their mode of life from the general body of the Jews, and who were in
possession of certain esoteric teachings of which those outside their
ranks were un-informed.

Thus Philo (*Quod omnis probes liber*, 12) writes of them that they were
"eminently worshippers of God (θεραπευταὶ θεοῦ), not in the sense that
they sacrifice living

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

animals (like the priests in the Temple), but that they are anxious to
keep their minds in a priestly state of holiness. They prefer to live in
villages, and avoid cities on account of the habitual wickedness of
those who in-habit them, knowing, as they do, that just as foul air
breeds disease, so there is danger of contracting an incurable disease
of the soul from such bad associations."

Again, in another of his works (*De Vita contemplativa*, ed. Conybeare,
pp. 53, 206), Philo says: "Of natural philosophy . . they study only
that which pertains to the existence of God and the beginning of all
things, otherwise they devote all their attention to ethics, using as
instructors the laws of their fathers, which, without the outpouring of
the Divine Spirit, the human mind could not have devised . . . for,
following their ancient traditions, they obtain their philosophy by
means of allegorical interpretations. . . . Of the love of God they
exhibit myriads of examples, inasmuch as they strive for a continued
uninterrupted life of purity and holiness; they avoid swearing and
falsehood, and they declare that God causes only good and no evil
whatsoever. . . No one possesses a house absolutely as his own, one
which does not at the same time belong to all; for, in addition to
living together in companies, their houses are open also to their
adherents coming from other

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

quarters. They have one storehouse for all, and the same diet; their
garments belong to all in common, and their meals are taken in common."

Josephus speaks of the Essenes in similar terms (see *Antiquities*,
XVIII. i. 2-6; also *De Bello Judaico*, II. viii. 2-13).

The points to be noted in both the fore-mentioned authors are: (*a*) the
great stress laid on fellowship, amounting to a kind of communism; (*b*)
their removal from the general people by reason of their higher
sanctity; (*c*) their devotion to the knowledge of the existence of God
and the beginning of all things; (*d*) their love of allegorical
interpretation.

Although it is exceedingly difficult to know what the Rabbinic term
equivalent to 'Essene' is, it is not hard to deduce, from names and
phrases scattered throughout the Rabbinic records, a theory that there
existed as early as the first Christian centuries either a distinct sect
of Jews, or individual Jews here and there, who combined mystical
speculation with an ascetic mode of life.

A similar phenomenon is observable in the history of the early Christian
Church. There was a life of primitive and austere fellowship. A group
here, a group there, gathered together with no other motive than that of
gaining a greater hold on the spiritual life than was prevalent in the
ordinary circles

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

of the people: "And the multitude of them that believed were of one
heart and soul; and not one of them said that aught of the things which
he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. . . . For
neither were there among them any that lacked: for as many as were
possessors of lands or houses sold them . . . and distribution was made
unto each according as any one had need" (*Acts*, iv. 32--35).

They seem to have lived on the borderland of an unusual ecstasy,
experiencing extraordinary invasions of the Divine, hearing mystic
sounds and seeing mystic visions which, to them, were the direct and
immediate revelations of the deepest and most sacred truths.

Illustrations of similar experiences in the bosom of the early
synagogue, as presented in the Rabbinic records, are the following:

There are several heterogeneous passages which speak of the existence
within the ancient Temple at Jerusalem of a special apartment, called
the *lishkât ḥashāīm* ('chamber of the silent \[or secret\] ones').
According to the statement of *Tosefta Shekalim*, ii. 16, there were to
be found in some cities of Palestine and Babylon men known as *Ḥashāīm*,
who reserved a special room in their house for depositing in it a
charity-box into which money for the poor could be put and withdrawn
with the utmost

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

silence. It was collected and distributed by men appointed for the
purpose by the *Ḥashāīm*, and, as it was all done with the strictest
secrecy, it looks as though there was a kind of communism among the
members of the order. The special chamber in the Temple, as mentioned
above, was also a place where gifts for the poor were deposited in
secret and withdrawn for distribution in secret.

Two facts seem to demonstrate that these *Ḥashāīm* were a small mystical
sect.

Firstly, they are given the special appellation of *yirē-ḥēt*, *i.e.*
'fearers of sin.' They were thus marked off by an extra sanctity from
the body of the people--and the student of the Rabbinic literature knows
that whenever a special title is accorded to a group or sect on the
grounds of special holiness, this holiness is always of an exceptionally
high order. It is the holiness of men in touch with the Divine. And, as
has just been remarked, their enthusiasm for doing good seems to have
been grounded on a kind of austere fellowship that reigned among them,
impelling them to do their work unseen by the madding crowd.

Secondly, the idea of silence or secrecy was frequently employed by the
early Rabbis in their mystical exegesis of Scripture. A typical
illustration is the following passage from the *Midrash Rabba* on
*Genesis* iii.:

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "R. Simeon son of
Jehozedek asked R. Samuel son of Naḥman (two Palestinian teachers of the
beginning of the 3rd century A.D.) and said unto him, Seeing that I have
heard concerning thee that thou art an adept in the Haggadah <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md), tell me whence the light was created. He
replied, It \[*i.e.* the Haggadah\] tells us that the Holy One (blessed
be He) enwrapped Himself in a garment, and the brightness of His
splendour lit up the universe from end to end. He \[*i.e.* the sage who
just replied\] said this in a whisper, upon which the other sage
retorted, Why dost thou tell this in a whisper, seeing that it is taught
clearly in a scriptural verse--'who coverest thyself with light as with
a garment'? (*Psalm*, civ. 2). Just as I have myself had it whispered
unto me, replied he, even so have I whispered it unto thee."

Another instance of what looks like a sect of esoteric teachers among
the Jews of the first centuries is the *Vatīkīn*, *i.e.* 'men of firm
principles.' Their mysticism seems to have clustered mostly round the
sentiments and outward conduct governing prayer. Indeed, throughout
Rabbinical literature the true suppliant before God is in many cases a
mystic. Only the mystic mood is the true prayerful mood. There is a
discussion in the Mishna of *Berachoth*, i. 2, as to what is the

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

earliest moment in the dawn at which the Shema’ (the technical name for
*Deuteronomy*, vi. 4-9) may be read. Upon this the comment is made, in
*T.B. Berachoth*, 9b, that "the *Vatīkīn* arranged the time for prayer
in such a way as to enable them to finish the reading of the Shema’ at
the exact moment of sunrise." According to the great Rabbinic
commentator R. Solomon b. Isaac (11th century), the *Vatīkīn* were "men
who were meek and carried out the commandment from pure love." It must
be borne in mind that throughout Jewish theology, 'meekness' (*’anavah*)
stands for something immensely higher than the moral connotation which
we customarily attribute to the virtue. It signifies a level of
religious devoutness which it is not given to every one to reach. To
carry out a commandment from pure love, means, in Jewish theology of all
ages, to attain a high stage of mystic elation which can only be arrived
at as the result of a long preliminary series of arduous efforts in the
upward path. To recite the Shema’ is, as the Rabbis frequently say, "to
take upon one's self the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven," and the phrase
'Kingdom of Heaven' has decidedly mystical associations, as we shall see
later. Hence one may plausibly conclude that the *Vatīkīn* were a
brotherhood whose dominant feature was a simplicity of living combined
with a degree

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

of earnest scrupulousness in prayer amounting to an adoration, a love,
of the Divine such as is experienced by the mystics of all nations and
all times.

And a similar description might be applied to the members of what
apparently was another esoteric order of those days--the *Zenūim*,
*i.e.* 'lowly, chaste ones.' As a matter of fact the Rabbinic records
are too vague and disconnected to enable scholars to say with any
certainty whether these *Zenūim* were an independent sect or whether the
word is merely another term denoting either or both of the other
fellowships already alluded to. They bear the hall-mark of all ancient
and mediæval Jewish mysticism in respect of the emphasis laid by them on
the importance of the letters comprising the Divine Name in Hebrew as
well as upon certain manipulations of the Hebrew alphabet generally. The
following passage occurs in *T.B. Ḳiddushin*, 71a:

"R. Judah said in the name of Rab \[*i.e.* R. Abba Arika, a Babylonian
teacher of the 3rd century A.D.\] the Name of forty-two letters can only
be entrusted by us to him who is modest \[*i.e.* *zenūa’*\] and meek, in
the midway of life, not easily provoked to anger, temperate, and free
from vengeful feelings. He who understands it, is cautious with it and
keeps it in purity, is loved above and is liked here below. He is
revered by his

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

fellow-men; he is heir to two worlds--this world and the world to come."

It is interesting to quote here the comment on this Rabbinic passage
made by the Spanish-Hebrew philosopher Moses Maimonides (1135-1204) in
his great work *The Guide of the Perplexed*. He says (part i. ch. lxii.
Eng. Trans. by M. Friedlander, Routledge, 1906):

"There was also a name of forty-two letters known among them. Every
intelligent person knows that one word of forty-two letters is
impossible. But it was a phrase of several words which had together
forty-two letters. There is no doubt that the words had such a meaning
as to convey a correct notion of the essence of God, in the way we have
stated. . . . Many believe that the forty-two letters are merely to be
pronounced mechanically; that by the knowledge of these, without any
further interpretation, they can attain to those exalted ends. . . . On
the contrary it is evident that all this exalted preparation aims at a
knowledge of metaphysics and includes ideas which constitute 'the
secrets of the Law' as we have explained."

Maimonides, it should be remembered, was a rationalist and anti-mystic;
and much of the old Rabbinic cosmological mysticism which was looked
upon as serious mystical speculation by many of his literary
contemporaries, was dubbed by him as metaphysics or physics.

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

But, to return to our subject, the best insight into the origin and
implication of these forty-two letters is afforded us by the Talmudic
passage last' quoted (*T.B. Ḳiddushin*, 71a), where we are told that in
the last days of the Temple the decadent priests were deemed unworthy to
pronounce the Divine Name in their official benedictions, and a name
consisting of twelve letters was substituted. What this name was is
nowhere given in the Rabbinic records. As time went on, it was deemed
inadvisable to entrust even this twelve-lettered name to every priest.
It was taught only to an elect set among them, who, when chanting the
benedictions in the general company of all the priests, used to
'swallow' its pronunciation (*i.e.* make it inaudible) in order not to
divulge it. The forty-two-lettered name probably arose in similar
circumstances, but whether the secrets of it were confided to a greater
or a smaller circle than that in which the twelve-lettered name was
known, is by no means apparent. Let it only be said here--as it is a
subject to which we shall return later on that in the elaborated systems
of the mediæval Kabbalists these many-lettered names of God (not only
forty-two, but also forty-five and seventy-two letters) are the pivots
on which huge masses of most curious mystical lore turn. The Ten Sefirot
have close connections with these doctrines of letters--

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

secret doctrines about the Divine nature, about creation, about the
relations subsisting between God and the universe.

Reference must here be made to what appears to be another order of
Jewish mystics in the opening centuries of the Christian era. The Mishna
(Tractate *Sukkah*, v. 2) speaks of 'the Ḥasidim and Anshé Ma’aseh'
(*i.e.* saints and miracle-workers) who, at the joyous feast of the
water-drawing at the Temple during Tabernacles, used to dance and
perform certain acrobatic feats with lighted torches. The allusions are
very vaguely worded, and it is hazardous to deduce any hard-and-fast
theories. But so much may be said, *viz*. that being mentioned together
in the same Mishna passage just quoted, and being mentioned in close
succession in another old passage of the Mishna (Tractate *Soṭah*, ix.
15), it is more than probable that they belonged to one and the same
sect. Again the phrase 'Anshé Ma’aseh' (as well as the singular form of
the first word) is frequently used in Rabbinic to mean 'miracle-worker,'
although in the Biblical Hebrew it would signify 'man of action.' There
is a passage in *T.B. Berachoth*, 18b, which gives a weird description
of the experience of a 'Ḥasid' who heard 'from behind the curtain'
certain secrets hidden from ordinary men. And the student of Rabbinics
knows

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

how many a Rabbi of these early centuries, gifted with the mystic
temperament, wielded a semi-miraculous power of foretelling the future
or of creating something out of nothing (see on this, Volz's *Der Geist
Gottes*, Tübingen, 1910, pp. 115-118). The vast literature of Rabbinic
angelology and demonology shows the same features--upon which Conybeare
(in *The Jewish Quarterly Review*, xi. 1-45) has thrown considerable
light in his translation of *The Testament of Solomon*.

It is a moot point as to whether these Ḥasidim are the lineal
descendants of the saintly party known by that name in the Maccabean
epoch. The point, however, which clearly emerges is, that a certain
esoteric wisdom and capacity for doing things, unknown to the
multitudes, was vouchsafed to certain bodies of men, who by the superior
purity of their living, by their unabated devotion to the things of the
spirit, and by their cultivation of a kind of brotherhood in which
simplicity, single-mindedness, and charity were the reigning virtues,
were enabled to enjoy a living in the world of the unseen.

One further matter, in conclusion. The interests of historical accuracy
demand that, as has been already pointed out, the student should be in
no hurry to say that these esoteric sects whose beliefs are so vaguely

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

and fragmentarily described in the Rabbinic literature, are to be
identified with the Essenes described in the writings of Philo and
Josephus. Resemblances there certainly are, but there are differences
too; and the Rabbinic allusions are too disjointed to enable one to form
an impression--even an inexact impression, leave alone an exact one--of
the lives and thoughts of these mystic gatherings. Philo and Josephus
paint a complete picture. The Talmud and Midrashim give but stray and
elusive hints. For one thing, the Essenes practised celibacy; marriage
must necessarily dissolve the fellowship characterising the order. The
Rabbinic records give no hint of the duty of celibacy. On the contrary,
marriage was held to promote a far higher sanctity than celibacy. But
the Rabbis tolerated some exceptional cases of celibacy; so that it is
difficult to speak categorically. Again, the centre of gravity of
Essenic religion seems to have been the cultivation of the highest
ethics. They stressed *inward* religion as demanded by the Mosaic code,
but, with the exception of a reverence for the holiness of the Sabbath,
they were comparatively unconcerned with the *outward* religious duties
incumbent upon the Jews of that time. Thus, they made little or nothing
of the sacrifices--doubtless a corollary of their emphasis on the
allegorical interpretation of Scripture. But it

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

was otherwise with the early mystics of the Rabbinic literature.
Although living in an atmosphere of mystery and looking to the Divine
secret to unroll itself at any moment, they yet never overlooked the
claims of institutional religion; they never flouted the ceremonial side
of Judaism; they were inflexible upholders of the Law and its associated
traditions. The same phenomenon is, of course, seen in the history of
Christian mysticism where the first-hand, inward, individualised
experiences of the ground-truths of religion are conformed to the
prevailing and accredited dogmas of Christianity.

There were mystics among the Pharisees as well as among the Essenes, and
yet we are told that the most spiritually-gifted among the former (who
constituted a *habūrah*, *i.e.* 'fellowship') were they who were most
scrupulous about the giving of the priestly dues--a purely external
religious duty based on the legalism of the Pentateuch. Indeed this
blending of legalism with spirituality, this consistent (and successful)
interweaving of the formalism of tradition with the mysticism of the
individual, is an arresting feature of Jewish theology in all ages.

In fine, as must be apparent from the general trend and contents of this
book, the whole of Jewish mysticism is really

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

nothing but a commentary on the Jewish Bible, an attempt to pierce
through to its most intimate and truest meaning; and what is the Bible
to the Jew but the admonisher to be loyal to the traditions of his
fathers? Only then will he find God when he is convinced that He was
found of those of his race who sought Him in an earlier day.
