Although the Kabbalah has lately become 'trendy,' there is a dearth of
well-written, scholarly books which give a larger perspective on the
subject of Jewish Mysticism. In addition, many of the books on the
subject are by Occultists, and however valuable they are, tend to have
their own agenda. Abelson puts the Kabbalah into context as the
outgrowth of a long-term evolution of Jewish mystical thought, starting
with the Essenes and the Merkabah (Chariot) mysticism of the Talmundic
era. He explains how neo-Platonism, Gnosticism, Christianity and other
currents influenced and were in turn impacted by Jewish mysticism. This
is a great backgrounder if you are interested in the Kabbalah or
Mysticism at any level.
