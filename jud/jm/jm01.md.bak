### EDITOR'S PREFACE

GENERAL and special studies on Christian mysticism are numerous enough;
but it is somewhat remarkable that, in their introductory pages,
authors, who have much to say of Plotinus and Neoplatonism, have nothing
or very little on the still more cognate subject of Jewish mysticism.
This is not, however, so very surprising, for, truth to tell, there is a
singular dearth of anything like an adequate introduction to the study
of Jewish mysticism itself. The impression left with the general reader
is that there is little of a mystical nature in the legitimate tradition
of Jewish religion, and that the Kabbalah is simply a morbid and late
growth, fed entirely by elements foreign to the genius of Israel. How
ill-founded is the former view, and how extreme the latter, may be seen
in the following pages. In an able summary, that

may well serve as an introduction to the general study of Jewish
mysticism, Dr. Abelson makes accessible to the general reader, in simple
terms, the results of his careful inquiry, based on the researches of
the best Jewish scholars, and reinforced by his own wide acquaintance
with Talmudic and Rabbinical literature. To write profitably on Jewish
mysticism, it is necessary to have, not only a discriminating sympathy
with the mystical standpoint, but also a first-hand knowledge of Jewish
religious literature, the peculiar genius of which, perhaps, no one but
a member of the race that has produced it can adequately appreciate and
interpret. In addition to this, Dr. Abelson comes well prepared for his
task, as he has already opened up a new field of research by his
valuable critical study on *The Immanence of God in Rabbinical
Literature*, a subject which is the indispensable presupposition of all
Jewish mysticism.
