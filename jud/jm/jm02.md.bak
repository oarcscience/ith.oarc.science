### PREFACE

THE following pages are designed to give the reader a bird's-eye view of
the salient features in Jewish mysticism rather than a solid
presentation of the subject as a whole. The reason for this will be
apparent when one thinks of the many centuries of variegated thought
that have had to be packed within the small number of pages allotted to
the book. It is this very fact, too, that will possibly give the present
treatment of the subject a fragmentary and tentative appearance. Thus
Chapter V. follows immediately upon the contents of Chapter IV., without
the least attempt to show any of the numerous intervening stages of
development. Similarly, Chapter VI., dealing with the *Zohar*, should
have been preceded by an exposition of the evolution of Jewish
theological thought in the many centuries which divide that chapter from
the matter contained in the

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

previous chapter. But lack of space made these omissions inevitable.
Should the reader be stimulated to a deeper study of the subject, he
will be easily led to the missing parts by the aid of the bibliography
at the end of the book.

I should add that the translated extracts from the *Zohar* are only in
some cases made by me from the original Hebrew-Aramaic. I owe many of
them to the French and German translations to be found in the works of
the scholars from whom I have drawn much of my material.
