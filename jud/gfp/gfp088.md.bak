### CHAPTER I

ACCORDING to Proposition XXV., a moving agent must exist which has moved
the substance of all existing transient things and enabled it to receive
Form. The cause of the motion of that agent is found in the existence of
another motor of the same or of a different class, the term "motion," in
a general sense, being common to four categories (Prop. IV.). This
series of motions is not infinite (Prop. III.); we find that it can only
be continued till the motion of the fifth element is arrived at, and
then it ends. The motion of the fifth element is the source of every
force that moves and prepares any substance on earth for its combination
with a certain form, and is connected with that force by a chain of
intermediate motions. The celestial sphere \[or the fifth element)
performs the act of locomotion which is the first of the several kinds
of motion (Prop. XIV.), and all locomotion is found to be the indirect
effect of the motion of this sphere; e.g., a stone is set in motion by a
stick, the stick by a man's hand, the hand by the sinews, the sinews by
the muscles, the muscles by the nerves, the nerves by the natural heat
of the body, and the heat of the body by its form. This is undoubtedly
the immediate motive cause, but the action of this immediate cause is
due to a certain design, e.g., to bring a stone into a hole by striking
against it with a stick in order to prevent the draught from coming
through the crevice. The motion of the air that causes the draught is
the effect of the motion of

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

the celestial sphere. Similarly it may be shown that the ultimate cause
of all genesis and destruction can be traced to the motion of the
sphere. But the motion of the sphere must likewise have been effected by
an agent (Prop. XVII.) residing either without the sphere or within it;
a third case being impossible. In the first case, if the motor is
*without* the sphere, it must either be corporeal or incorporeal: if
incorporeal, it cannot be said that the agent is without the sphere; it
can only be described as *separate* from it; because an incorporeal
object can only be said metaphorically to reside without a certain
corporeal object. In the second case, if the agent resides within the
sphere, it must be either a force distributed throughout the whole
sphere so that each part of the sphere includes a part of the force, as
is the case with the heat of fire; or it is an indivisible force, e.g.,
the soul and the intellect (Props. X. and XI.). The agent which sets the
sphere in motion must consequently be one of the following four things:
a corporeal object without the sphere; an incorporeal object separate
from it; a force spread throughout the whole of the sphere; or an
indivisible force \[within the sphere\].

The first case, viz., that the moving agent of the sphere is a corporeal
object without the sphere, is impossible, as will be explained. Since
the moving agent is corporeal, it must itself move while setting another
object in motion (Prop. IX.), and as the sixth element would likewise
move when imparting motion to another body, it would be set in motion by
a seventh element, which must also move. An infinite number of bodies
would thus be required before the sphere could be set in motion. This is
contrary to Proposition II.

The third case, viz., that the moving object be a force distributed
throughout the whole body, is likewise impossible. For the sphere is
corporeal, and must therefore be finite (Prop. I.); also the force it
contains must be finite (Prop. XII.), since each part of the sphere
contains part of the force (Prop. XI.): the latter can consequently not
produce an infinite motion, such as we assumed according to Proposition
XXVI., which we admitted for the present.

The fourth case is likewise impossible, viz., that the sphere is set in
motion by an indivisible force residing in the sphere in the same manner
as the soul resides in the body of man. For this force, though
indivisible, could not be the cause of infinite motion by itself alone:
because if that were the case the prime motor would have an accidental
motion (Prop. VI.). But things that move accidentally must come to rest
(Prop. VIII.), and then the thing comes also to rest which is set in
motion. (The following may serve as a further illustration of the nature
of accidental motion. When man is moved by the soul, i.e., by his form,
to go from the basement of the house to the upper storey, his body moves
directly, while the soul, the really efficient cause of that motion,
participates in it accidentally. For through the translation of the body
from the basement to the upper storey, the soul has likewise changed its
place, and when no fresh impulse for the motion of the body is given by
the soul, the body which has been set in motion by such impulse comes to
rest, and the accidental motion of the soul is discontinued).
Consequently the motion of that supposed first motor must be due to some
cause which does not form part of things composed of two elements, viz.,
a moving agent

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

and an object moved: if such a cause is present the motor in that
compound sets the other element in motion; in the absence of such a
cause no motion takes place. Living beings do therefore not move
continually, although each of them possesses an indivisible motive
element; because this element is not constantly in motion, as it would
be if it produced motion of its own accord. On the contrary, the things
to which the action is due are separate from the motor. The action is
caused either by desire for that which is agreeable, or by aversion from
that which is disagreeable, or by some image, or by some ideal when the
moving being has the capacity of conceiving it. When any of these causes
are present then the motor acts; its motion is accidental, and must
therefore come to an end (Prop. VIII.). If the motor of the sphere were
of this kind the sphere could not move *ad infinitum*. Our opponent,
however, holds that the spheres move continually *ad infinitum*: if this
were the case, and it is in fact possible (Prop. XIII.), the efficient
cause of the motion of the sphere must, according to the above division,
be of the second kind, viz., something incorporeal and separate from the
sphere.

It may thus be considered as proved that the efficient cause of the
motion of the sphere, if that motion be eternal, is neither itself
corporeal nor does it reside in a corporeal object; it must move neither
of its own accord nor accidentally; it must be indivisible and
unchangeable (Prop. VII. and Prop. V.). This Prime Motor of the sphere
is God, praised be His name!

The hypothesis that there exist two Gods is inadmissible, because
absolutely incorporeal beings cannot be counted (Prop. XVI.), except as
cause and effect; the relation of time is not applicable to God (Prop.
XV.), because motion cannot be predicated of Him.

The result of the above argument is consequently this: the sphere cannot
move *ad infinitum* of its own accord; the Prime Motor is not corporeal,
nor a force residing within a body; it is One, unchangeable, and in its
existence independent of time. Three of our postulates are thus proved
by the principal philosophers.

The philosophers employ besides another argument, based on the following
proposition of Aristotle. If there be a thing composed of two elements,
and the one of them is known to exist also by itself, apart from that
thing, then the other element is likewise found in existence by itself
separate from that compound. For if the nature of the two elements were
such that they could only exist together--as, e.g., matter and
form--then neither of them could in any way exist separate from the
other. The fact that the one component is found also in a separate
existence proves that the two elements are not indissolubly connected,
and that the same must therefore be the case with the other component.
Thus we infer from the existence of honey-vinegar and of honey by
itself, that there exists also vinegar by itself. After having explained
this proposition Aristotle continues thus: We notice many objects
consisting of a *motor* and a *motum*, i.e., objects which set other
things in motion, and whilst doing so are themselves set in motion by
other things; such is clearly the case as regards all the middle members
of a series of things in motion. We also see a thing that is moved, but
does not itself move anything, viz., the last member of the series:
consequently a *motor* must exist without being at the same time a
*motum*, and that is the Prime Motor, which,

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

not being subject to motion, is indivisible, incorporeal, and
independent of time, as has been shown in the preceding argument.

*Third Philosophical Argument*.--This is taken from the words of
Aristotle, though he gives it in a different form. It runs as follows:
There is no doubt that many things actually exist, as, e.g., things
perceived with the senses. Now there are only three cases conceivable,
viz., either all these things are without beginning and without end, or
all of them have beginning and end, or some are with and some without
beginning and end. The first of these three cases is altogether
inadmissible, since we clearly perceive objects which come into
existence and are subsequently destroyed. The second case is likewise
inadmissible, for if everything had but a temporary existence all things
might be destroyed, and that which is enunciated of a whole class of
things as possible is necessarily actual. All things must therefore come
to an end, and then nothing would ever be in existence, for there would
not exist any being to produce anything. Consequently nothing whatever
would exist \[if all things were transient\]; but as we see things
existing, and find ourselves in existence we conclude as follows:--Since
there are undoubtedly beings of a temporary existence, there must also
be an eternal being that is not subject to destruction, and whose
existence is real, not merely possible.

It has been further argued that the existence of this being is
necessary, either on account of itself alone or on account of some
external force. In the latter case its existence and non-existence would
be equally possible, because of its own properties, but its existence
would be necessary on account of the external force. That force would
then be the being that possesses absolute existence (Prop. XIX). It is
therefore certain that there must be a being which has absolutely
independent existence, and is the source of the existence of all things,
whether transient or permanent, if, as Aristotle assumes. there is in
existence such a thing, which is the effect of an eternal cause, and
must therefore itself be eternal. This is a proof the correctness of
which is not doubted, disputed, or rejected, except by those who have no
knowledge of the method of proof. We further say that the existence of
anything that has independent existence is not due to any cause (Prop.
X.), and that such a being does not include any plurality whatever
(Prop. XXI.); consequently it cannot be a body, nor a force residing in
a body (Prop. XXII.). It is now clear that there must be a being with
absolutely independent existence, a being whose existence cannot be
attributed to any external cause, and which does not include different
elements; it cannot therefore be corporeal, or a force residing in 4
corporeal object; this being is God.

It can easily be proved that absolutely independent existence cannot be
attributed to two beings. For, if that were the case, absolutely
independent existence would be a property added to the substance of
both; neither of them would be absolutely independent on account of
their essence, but only through a certain property, viz., that of this
independent existence, which is common to both. It can besides be shown
in many ways that independent existence cannot be reconciled with the
principle of dualism by any means. It would make no difference, whether
we imagine two beings of similar or of different properties. The reason
for all this is to be sought in the absolute simplicity and in the
utmost perfection of the essence of this being, which is

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

the only member of its species, and does not depend on any cause
whatever this being has therefore nothing in common with other beings.

*Fourth Argument*.--This is likewise a well-known philosophical
argument. We constantly see things passing from a state of potentiality
to that of actuality, but in every such case there is for that
transition of a thing an agent separate from it (Prop. XVIII). It is
likewise clear that the agent has also passed from potentiality to
actuality. It has at first been potential, because it could not be
actual, owing to some obstacle contained in itself, or on account of the
absence of a certain relation between itself and the object of its
action: it became an actual agent as soon as that relation was present.
Whichever cause be assumed, an agent is again necessary to remove the
obstacle or to create the relation. The same can be argued respecting
this last-mentioned agent that creates the relation or removes the
obstacle. This series of causes cannot go on *ad infinitum*; we must at
last arrive at a cause of the transition of an object from the state of
potentiality to that of actuality, which is constant, and admits of no
potentiality whatever. In the essence of this cause nothing exists
potentially, for if its essence included any possibility of existence it
would not exist at all (Prop. XXIII.); it cannot be corporeal, but it
must be spiritual (Prop. XXIV.); and the immaterial being that includes
no possibility whatever, but exists actually by its own essence, is God.
Since He is incorporeal, as has been demonstrated, it follows that He is
One (Prop. XVI).

Even if we were to admit the Eternity of the Universe, we could by any
of these methods prove the existence of God; that He is One and
incorporeal, and that He does not reside as a force in a corporeal
object.

The following is likewise a correct method to prove the Incorporeality
and the Unity of God: If there were two Gods, they would necessarily
have one element in common by virtue of which they were Gods, and
another element by which they were distinguished from each other and
existed as two Gods; the distinguishing element would either be in both
different from the property common to both-in that case both of them
would consist of different elements, and neither of them would be the
First Cause, or have absolutely independent existence; but their
existence would depend on certain causes (Prop. XIX.)--or the
distinguishing element would only in one of them be different from the
element common to both: then that being could not have absolute
independence.

*Another proof of the Unity of God*.--It has been demonstrated by proof
that the whole existing world is one organic body, all parts of which
are connected together; also, that the influences of the spheres above
pervade the earthly substance and prepare it for its forms. Hence it is
impossible to assume that one deity be engaged in forming one part, and
another deity in forming another part of that organic body of which all
parts are closely connected together. A duality could only be imagined
in this way, either that at one time the one deity is active, the other
at another time, or that both act simultaneously, nothing being done
except by both together. The first alternative is certainly absurd for
many reasons: if at the time the one deity be active the other *could*
also be active, there is no reason why the one deity should then act and
the other not; if, on the other hand, it be impossible for the one deity
to act when the other is at work, there must be

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

some other cause \[besides these deities\] which \[at a certain time\]
enables the one to act and disables the other. \[Such difference would
not be caused by time\], since time is without change, and the object of
the action likewise remains one and the same organic whole. Besides, if
two deities existed in this way, both would be subject to the relations
of time, since their actions would depend on time; they would also in
the moment of acting pass from potentiality to actuality, and require an
agent for such transition: their essence would besides include
possibility \[of existence\]. It is equally absurd to assume that both
together produce everything in existence, and that neither of them does
anything alone; for when a number of forces must be united for a certain
result, none of these forces acts of its own accord, and none is by
itself the immediate cause of that result, but their union is the
immediate cause. It has, furthermore, been proved that the action of the
absolute cannot be due to an \[external\] cause. The union is also an
act which presupposes a cause effecting that union, and if that cause be
one, it is undoubtedly God: but if it also consists of a number of
separate forces, a cause is required for the combination of these
forces, as in the first case. Finally, one simple being must be arrived
at, that is the cause of the existence of the Universe, which is one
whole; it would make no difference whether we assumed that the First
Cause had produced the Universe by *creatio ex nihilo*, or whether the
Universe co-existed with the First Cause. It is thus clear how we can
prove the Unity of God from the fact that this Universe is one whole.

*Another argument concerning the Incorporeality of God*.--Every
corporeal object is composed of matter and form (Prop. XXII.); every
compound of these two elements requires an agent for effecting their
combination. Besides, it is evident that a body is divisible and has
dimensions: a body is thus undoubtedly subject to accidents.
Consequently nothing corporeal can be a unity, either because everything
corporeal is divisible or because it is a compound; that is to say, it
can logically be analysed into two elements; because a body can only be
said to be a certain body when the distinguishing element is added to
the corporeal substratum, and must therefore include two elements: but
it has been proved that the Absolute admits of no dualism whatever.

Now that we have discussed these proofs, we will expound our own method
in accordance with our promise.
