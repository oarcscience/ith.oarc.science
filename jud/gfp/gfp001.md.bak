### PREFACE

The first Edition of the English Translation of Maimonides *Dalalāt*
*al-Ḥairin* being exhausted without having fully supplied the demand, I
prepared a second, revised edition of the Translation. In the new
edition the three volumes of the first edition have been reduced to one
volume by the elimination of the notes; besides Hebrew words and phrases
have been eliminated or transliterated. By these changes the translator
sought to produce a cheap edition in order to bring the work of
Maimonides within the reach of all students of Theology and Jewish
Literature.

M. FRIEDLÄNDER.

Jews’ College, *July* 1904.
