### CHAPTER XLV

*Shama‘* is used homonymously. It signifies "to hear," and also "to
obey." As regards the first signification, comp. "Neither let it be
heard out of thy mouth" (Exod. xxiii. 13); "And the fame thereof was
heard in Pharaoh's house" (Gen. xlv. 26). Instances of this kind are
numerous.

Equally frequent are the instances of this verb being used in the sense
of "to obey": "And they hearkened (*shama‘*) not unto Moses" (Exod. vi.
9). "If they obey (*yishme‘ü*) and serve him (Job xxxvi. 11); "Shall we
then hearken (*nishma‘*) unto you" (Neh. xiii. 27); "Whosoever will not
hearken (*yishma‘*) unto thy words" (Josh. i. 18).

The verb also signifies "to know" ("to understand"), comp. "A nation
whose tongue, i.e., its language, thou shalt not understand" (*tishma‘*)
(Deut. xxviii. 49). The verb *shama‘*, used in reference to God, must be
taken in the sense of perceiving, which is part of the third
signification, whenever, according to the literal interpretation of the
passage, it appears to have the first meaning: comp. "And the Lord heard
it" (Num. xi. 1); "For that He heareth your murmurings" (Exod. xvi. 7).
In all such passages mental perception is meant. When, however,
according to the literal interpretation

the verb appears to have the second signification, it implies that God
responded to the prayer of man and fulfilled his wish, or did not
respond and did not fulfil his wish: "I will surely hear his cry" (Exod.
xxii. 23); "I will hear, for I am gracious" (*ib*. 27); "Bow down thine
ear, and hear" (2 Kings xix. 16); "But the Lord would not hearken to
your voice, nor give ear unto you" (Deut. i. 45); "Yea, when ye make
many prayers, I will not hear" (Isa. i. 15); "For I will not hear thee"
(Jer. vii. 16). There are many instances in which *shama‘* has this
sense.

Remarks will now be presented to you on these metaphors and similes,
which will quench your thirst, and explain to you all their meanings
without leaving a doubt.
