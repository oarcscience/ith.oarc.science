### CHAPTER XIV

THE homonymous term *adam* is in the first place the name of the first
man, being, as Scripture indicates, derived from *adamah*, "earth."
Next, it means "mankind," as "My spirit shall not strive with man
(*adam*)" (Gen. vi. 3). Again "Who knoweth the spirit of the children of
man (*adam*)" (Eccles. iii. 21); "so that a man (*adam*) has no
pre-eminence above a beast" (Eccles. iii. 19). Adam. signifies also "the
multitude," "the lower classes" as opposed to those distinguished from
the rest, as "Both low (*bene adam*) and high (*bene ish*)" (Ps. xlix.
3).

It is in this third signification that it occurs in the verses, "The
sons of the higher order (*Elohim*) saw the daughters of the lower order
(*adam*)" (Gen. vi. 2); and "Forsooth! as the humble man (*adam*) you
shall die" (Ps. lxxxii. 7).
