### CHAPTER L

WHEN reading my present treatise, bear in mind that by "faith" we do not
understand merely that which is uttered with the lips, but also that
which is apprehended by the soul, the conviction that the object \[of
belief\] is exactly as it is apprehended. If, as regards real or
supposed truths, you content yourself with giving utterance to them in
words, without apprehending them or believing in them, especially if you
do not seek real truth, you have a very easy task as, in fact, you will
find many ignorant people professing articles of faith without
connecting any idea with them.

If, however, you have a desire to rise to a higher state, viz., that of
reflection, and truly to hold the conviction that God is One and
possesses true unity, without admitting plurality or divisibility in any
sense whatever, you must understand that God has no essential attribute
in any form or in any sense whatever, and that the rejection of
corporeality implies the rejection of essential attributes. Those who
believe that God is One, and that He has many attributes, declare the
unity with their lips, and assume plurality in their thoughts. This is
like the doctrine of the Christians, who say that He is one and He is
three, and that the three are one. Of the same character is the doctrine
of those who say that God is One, but that He has many attributes; and
that He with His attributes is One, although they deny corporeality and
affirm His most absolute freedom from matter; as if our

object were to seek forms of expression, not subjects of belief. For
belief is only possible after the apprehension of a thing; it consists
in the conviction that the thing apprehended has its existence beyond
the mind \[in reality\] exactly as it is conceived in the mind. If in
addition to this we are convinced that the thing cannot be different in
any way from what we believe it to be, and that no reasonable argument
can be found for the rejection of the belief or for the admission of any
deviation from it, then the belief is true. Renounce desires and habits,
follow your reason, and study what I am going to say in the chapters
which follow on the rejection of the attributes; you will then be fully
convinced of what we have said: you will be of those who truly conceive
the Unity of God, not of those who utter it with their lips without
thought, like men of whom it has been said, "Thou art near in their
mouth, and far from their reins" (Jer. xii. 2). It is right that a man
should belong to that class of men who have a conception of truth and
understand it, though they do not speak of it. Thus the pious are
advised and addressed, "Commune with your own heart upon your bed and be
still. Selah." (Ps. iv. 5.)
