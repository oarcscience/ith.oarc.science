### CHAPTER III

WHEN Ezekiel recalled to memory the form of the Chariot, which he
described in the beginning of the book, the same vision presented itself
to him a second time; in this vision he was borne to Jerusalem. He
explains in describing it things which have not been made clear at
first, e.g., he substitutes the term "cherubim" for *Ḥayyot*, whereby he
expresses that the

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Ḥayyot* of the
first vision are likewise angels like the cherubim. He says, therefore:
"Where the cherubims went, the *Ofannim* went by them: and when the
cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same
*Ofannim* also turned not from beside them" (x. 16). By these words he
shows how closely connected the two motions are \[viz., that of the
*Ḥayyot* and that of the *Ofannim*\]. The prophet adds, "This is the
Hayyah that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar: and I
knew that they were cherubims" (ver. 20). He thus describes the same
forms and the same motions, and states that the *Ḥayyot* and the
cherubim are identical. A second point is then made clear in this second
description, namely, that the *Ofannim* are spherical; for the prophet
says, "As for the *Ofannim*, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O
sphere" (ver. 13). A third point concerning the *Ofannim* is illustrated
here in the following words: "To the place whither the head looked they
followed it: they turned not as they went" (ver. 11). The motion of the
*Ofannim* is thus described as involuntary, and directed "to the place
whither the head looketh"; and of this it is stated that it moves
"whither the spirit is to go" (i. 20). A fourth point is added
concerning the *Ofannim*, namely, "And the *Ofannim* were full of eyes
round about, even the *Ofannim* that they four had" (x. 12). This has
not been mentioned before. In this second description there are further
mentioned" their flesh, and their backs, and their hands, and their
wings" (*ibid*.), whilst in the first account none of these is
mentioned: and it is only stated that they are bodies. Though they are
endowed in the second account with flesh, hands, and wings, no form is
given to them. In the second account each *Ofan* is attributed to a
cherub, "one *Ofan* by one cherub, and another *Ofan* by another
cherub." The four *Ḥayyot* are then described as one Hayyah on account
of their interjoining: "This is the *Ḥayyah* that I saw under the God of
Israel by the river of Chebar" (ver. 20). Also the *Ofannim*, though
being four in number, as has been mentioned, are called "one *ofan* upon
the earth" (ver. 15), because they interjoin, and "they four have one
likeness" (ver. 16). This is the additional explanation which the second
vision gives of the form of the *Ḥayyot* and the *Ofannim*.
