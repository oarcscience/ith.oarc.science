### CHAPTER III

THE theory of Aristotle in respect to the causes of the motion of the
spheres led him to assume the existence of Intelligences. Although this
theory consists of assertions which cannot be proved, yet it is the
least open to doubt, and is more systematic than any other, as has been
stated by Alexander in the book called *The Origin of the Universe*. It
includes maxims which are identical with those taught in Scripture, and
it is to a still greater extent in harmony with doctrines contained in
well-known genuine Midrashim, as will be explained by me. For this
reason I will cite his views and his proofs, and collect from them what
coincides with the teachings of Scripture, and agrees with the doctrine
held by our Sages.
