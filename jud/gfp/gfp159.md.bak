### CHAPTER XXIII

ASSUMING the first part of the history of Job as having actually taken
place, the five, viz., Job and his friends, agreed that the misfortune
of Job was known to God, and that it was God that caused Job's
suffering. They further agree that God does no wrong, and that no
injustice can be ascribed to Him. You will find these ideas frequently
repeated in the words of Job. When you consider the words of the five
who take part in the discussion, you will easily notice that things said
by one of them are also uttered by the rest. The arguments are repeated,
mixed up, and interrupted by Job's description of his acute pain and
troubles, which had come upon him in spite of his strict righteousness,
and by an account of his charity, humane disposition, and good acts. The
replies of the friends to Job are likewise interrupted by exhortations
to patience, by words of comfort, and other speeches tending to make him
forget his grief. He is told by them to be silent; that he ought not to
let loose the bridle of his tongue, as if he were in dispute with
another man; that he ought silently to submit to the judgments of God.
Job replies that the intensity of his pains did not permit him to bear
patiently, to collect his thoughts and to say what he ought to say. The
friends, on the other hand, contend that those who act well receive
reward, and those who act wickedly are punished. When a wicked and
rebellious person is seen in prosperity, it may be assumed for certain
that a change will take place; he will die, or troubles will afflict him
and his house. When we find a worshipper of God in misfortune, we may be
certain that God will heal the stroke of his wound. This idea is
frequently repeated in the words of the three friends, Eliphaz, Bildad,
and Zofar, who agree in this opinion. It is, however, not the object of
this chapter to describe in what they agree, but to define the
distinguishing characteristic of each of them, and to elucidate the
opinion of each as regards the question why the most simple and upright
man is afflicted with the greatest and acutest pain. Job found in this
fact a proof that the righteous

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

and the wicked are equal before God, who holds all mankind in contempt.
Job therefore says (ix. 22, 23): "This is one thing, therefore I said
it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. If the scourge slay
suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent." He thus declares
that when a scourge comes suddenly, killing and destroying all it meets,
God laughs at the trial of the innocent. He further confirms this view
in the following passage: "One dieth in his full strength, being wholly
at case and quiet. His vessels are full of milk, etc. And another dieth
in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. They
shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them"
(*ibid*. xxi. 23-26). In a similar manner he shows the good condition
and prosperity of wicked people; and is even very explicit on this
point. He speaks thus: "Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling
taketh hold on my flesh. Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea,
are mighty in power? Their seed is established in their sight with
them," etc. (*ibid*. 6-8). Having thus described their prosperity he
addresses his opponents, and says to them: "Granted that as you think,
the children of this prosperous atheist will perish after his death, and
their memory will be blotted out, what harm will the fate of his family
cause him after his death? For what pleasure hath he in his house after
him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?" (*ibid*.
21). Job then explains that there is no hope after death, so that the
cause \[of the misfortune of the righteous man\] is nothing else but
entire neglect on the part of God. He is therefore surprised that God
has not abandoned the creation of man altogether; and that after having
created him, He does not take any notice of him. He says in his
surprise: "Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like
cheese?" etc. (*ibid*. x. 10, *seq*.). This is one of the different
views held by some thinkers on Providence. Our Sages (B. T. Baba B. 16a)
condemned this view of Job as mischievous, and expressed their feeling
in words like the following: "dust should have filled the mouth of Job";
"Job wished to upset the dish"; "Job denied the resurrection of the
dead"; "He commenced to blaspheme." When, however, God said to Eliphaz
and his colleagues, "You have not spoken of me the thing that is right,
as my servant Job hath" (xlii. 7), our Sages assume as the cause of this
rebuke, the maxim "Man is not punished for that which he utters in his
pain"; and that God ignored the sin of Job \[in his utterances\],
because of the acuteness of his suffering. But this explanation does not
agree with the object of the whole allegory. The words of God are
justified, as I will show, by the fact that Job abandoned his first very
erroneous opinion, and himself proved that it was an error. It is the
opinion which suggests itself as plausible at first thought, especially
in the minds of those who meet with mishaps, well knowing that they have
not merited them through sins. This is admitted by all, and therefore
this opinion was assigned to Job. But he is represented to hold this
view only so long as he was without wisdom, and knew God only by
tradition, in the same manner as religious people generally know Him. As
soon as he had acquired a true knowledge of God, he confessed that there
is undoubtedly true felicity in the knowledge of God; it is attained by
all who acquire that knowledge, and no earthly trouble can disturb it.
So long as Job's knowledge of God was based on tradition and
communication, and not on research, he believed that such imaginary good

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

as is possessed in health, riches, and children, was the utmost that men
can attain: this was the reason why he was in perplexity, and why he
uttered the above-mentioned opinions, and this is also the meaning of
his words: "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine
eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent because of dust and
ashes" (xlii. 5, 6); that is to say he abhorred all that he had desired
before, and that he was sorry that he had been in dust and ashes; comp.
"and he sat down among the ashes" (ii. 8). On account of this last
utterance, which implies true perception, it is said afterwards in
reference to him, "for you have not spoken of me the thing that is
right, as my servant Job hath."

The opinion set forth by Eliphaz in reference to Job's suffering is
likewise one of the current views on Providence. He holds that the fate
of Job was in accordance with strict justice. Job was guilty of sins for
which he deserved his fate. Eliphaz therefore says to Job: "Is not thy
wickedness great, and thine iniquities infinite?" (xxii. 5). He then
points out to him that his upright actions and his good ways, on which
he relies, need not be so perfect in the eyes of God that no punishment
should be inflicted on him. "Behold, he putteth no trust in his
servants: and his angels he chargeth with folly: how much less in them
that dwell in houses of clay," etc. (iv. 17-18). Eliphaz never abandoned
his belief that the fate of man is the result of justice, that we do not
know all our shortcomings for which we are punished, nor the way how we
incur the punishment through them.

Bildad the Shuhite defends in this question the theory of reward and
compensation. He therefore tells Job that if he is innocent and without
sin, his terrible misfortunes will be the source of great reward, will
be followed by the best compensation, and will prove a boon to him as
the cause of great bliss in the future world. This idea is expressed in
the words: "If thou be pure and upright, surely now he will awake for
thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. Though
thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end will greatly increase"
(viii. 6-8). This opinion concerning, Providence is widespread, and we
have already explained it.

Zofar the Naamathite holds that the Divine Will is the source of
everything that happens: no further cause can be sought for His actions,
and it cannot be asked why He has done this and why He has not done
that. That which God does can therefore not be explained by the way of
justice or the result of wisdom. His true Essence demands that He does
what He wills; we are unable to fathom the depth of His wisdom, and it
is the law and rule of this wisdom that whatever He does is done because
it is His will and for no other cause. Zofar therefore says to Job: "But
oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; and that he
would show thee the secrets of wisdom, for wisdom hath two portions I
Know, therefore, that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity
deserveth. Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
Almighty unto perfection?" (xi. 6-7).

In this manner consider well how the Book of Job discusses the problem,
which has perplexed many people \` and led them to adopt in reference to
Divine Providence some one of the theories which I have explained above:
all possible different theories are mentioned therein. The problem is
described either by way of fiction or in accordance with real fact, as
having

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

manifested itself in a man famous for his excellency and wisdom. The
view ascribed to Job is the theory of Aristotle. Eliphaz holds the
opinion taught in Scripture, Bildad's opinion is identical with that of
the Mu’tazilah, whilst Zofar defends the theory of the Asha’riyah. These
were the ancient views on Providence; later on a new theory was set
forth, namely, that ascribed to Elihu. For this reason he is placed
above the others, and described as younger in years but greater in
wisdom. He censures Job for his foolishly exalting himself, expressing
surprise at such great troubles befalling a good man, and dwelling on
the praises of his own deeds. He also tells the three friends that their
minds have been weakened by great age. A profound and wonderful
discourse then follows. Reflecting on his words we may at first thought
be surprised to find that he does not add anything to the words of
Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zofar; and that he only repeats their ideas in
other terms and more explicitly. For he likewise censures and rebukes
Job, attributes justice to God, relates His wonders in nature, and holds
that God is not affected by the service of the worshipper, nor by the
disobedience of the rebellious. All this has already been said by His
colleagues. But after due consideration we see clearly the new idea
introduced by Elihu, which is the principal object of his speech, an
idea which has not been uttered by those who spoke before him. In
addition to this he mentions also other things set forth by the previous
speakers, in the same manner as each of the rest, viz., Job and his
three friends, repeat what the others have said. The purpose of this
repetition is to conceal the opinion peculiar to each speaker, and to
make all appear in the eyes of the ordinary reader to utter one and the
same view, although in reality this is not the case. The new idea, which
is peculiar to Elihu and has not been mentioned by the others, is
contained in his metaphor of the angel's intercession. It is a frequent
occurrence, he says, that a man becomes ill, approaches the gates of
death, and is already given up by his neighbours. If then an angel, of
any kind whatever, intercedes on his behalf and prays for him, the
intercession and prayers are accepted; the patient rises from his
illness, is saved, and returns to good health. This result is not always
obtained: intercession and deliverance do not always follow each other:
it happens only twice, or three times. Elihu therefore says: "If there
be an angel with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show unto
man his uprightness," etc. (xxxiii. 29). He then describes man's
condition when convalescent and the rejoicing at his recovery, and
continues thus: "Lo, all these things worketh God twice, three times
with man" (*ibid*. 29). This idea occurs only in the words of Elihu. His
description of the method of prophecy in preceding verses is likewise
new. He says: "Surely God speaketh in one way, yea in two ways, yet man
perceiveth it not. In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep
falleth upon man, in slumberings upon the bed" (*ibid*. 14, 15). He
afterwards supports and illustrates his theory by a description of many
natural phenomena, such as thunder, lightning, rain, and winds; with
these are mixed up accounts of various incidents of life, e.g., an
account of pestilence contained in the following passage: "In a moment
they die, and at midnight; the people become tumultuous and pass away"
(xxxiv. 20). Great wars are described in the following verse: "He
breaketh in pieces mighty men without number, and setteth others in
their stead" (*ibid*. 24).

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> There are many
more passages of this kind. In a similar manner the Revelation that
reached Job (chap. xxxviii., chap. xli.), and explained to him the error
of his whole belief, constantly describes natural objects, and nothing
else; it describes the elements, meteorological phenomena, and
peculiarities of various kinds of living beings. The sky, the heavens,
Orion and Pleiades are only mentioned in reference to their influence
upon our atmosphere, so that Job's attention is in this prophecy only
called to things below the lunar sphere. Elihu likewise derives
instruction from the nature of various kinds of animals. Thus he says:
"He teacheth us through the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wise
through the fowls of heaven" (xxxv. 11). He dwells longest on the nature
of the Leviathan, which possesses a combination of bodily peculiarities
found separate in different animals, in those that walk, those that
swim, and those that fly. The description of all these things serves to
impress on our minds that we are unable to comprehend how these
transient creatures come into existence, or to imagine how their natural
properties commenced to exist, and that these are not like the things
which we are able to produce. Much less can we compare the manner in
which God rules and manages His creatures with the manner in which we
rule and manage certain beings. We must content ourselves with this, and
believe that nothing is hidden from God, as Elihu says: "For his eyes
are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. There is no
darkness nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide
themselves" (xxxiv. 21, 22). But the term management, when applied to
God, has not the same meaning which it has when applied to us; and when
we say that He rules His creatures we do not mean that He does the same
as we do when we rule over other beings. The term "rule" has not the
same definition in both cases: it signifies two different notions, which
have nothing in common but the name. In the same manner, as there is a
difference between works of nature and productions of human handicraft,
so there is a difference between God's rule, providence, and intention
in reference to all natural forces, and our rule, providence, and
intention in reference to things which are the objects of our rule,
providence, and intention. This lesson is the principal object of the
whole Book of Job; it lays down this principle of faith, and recommends
us to derive a proof from nature, that we should not fall into the error
of imagining His knowledge to be similar to ours, or His intention,
providence, and rule similar to ours. When we know this we shall find
everything that may befall us easy to bear; mishap will create no doubts
in our hearts concerning God, whether He knows our affairs or not,
whether He provides for us or abandons us. On the contrary, our fate
will increase our love of God; as is said in the end of this prophecy:
"Therefore I abhor myself and repent concerning the dust and ashes"
(xlii. 6); and as our Sages say: "The pious do everything out of love,
and rejoice in their own afflictions." (B. T. Shabb. 88*b*.) If you pay
to my words the attention which this treatise demands, and examine all
that is said in the Book of Job, all will be clear to you, and you will
find that I have grasped and taken hold of the whole subject; nothing
has been left unnoticed, except such portions as are only introduced
because of the context and the whole plan of the allegory. I have
explained this method several times in the course of this treatise.
