### CHAPTER XXXVI

THE reason of all precepts of the first class, viz., of the principles
enumerated by us in the *Hilkot yesode ha-torah*, is obvious. Consider
them one by one, and you will find that the lesson which every one of
them contains is correct and demonstrable. It is also evident that the
precepts which exhort and command us to learn and to teach are useful;
for without wisdom there cannot be any good act or any true knowledge.
The law which prescribes to honour the teachers of the Law is likewise
useful; for if they were not considered by the people as great and
honourable men, they would not be followed as guides in their principles
and actions. The Law demands also that we be humble and modest \[in
their presence\]. "Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head" (Lev. xix.
32). This class includes also the commandment to swear by the name of
God and the prohibition of swearing falsely or in vain. The reason for
all these precepts is evident; they aim at the glorification of God:
they prescribe acts which lead to the belief in God's greatness.
Likewise the commandment to cry to God in time of trouble, "to blow an
alarm with the trumpets" (Num. x. 9), belongs to this class. We are told
to offer up prayers to God, in order to establish firmly the true
principle that God takes notice of our ways, that He can make them
successful if we worship Him, or disastrous if we disobey Him, that
\[success and failure\] are not the result of chance or accident. In
this sense we must understand the passage, "If ye walk with me by
chance" (*beḳeri*, Lev. xxvi. 21); i.e., if I bring troubles upon you
for punishment, and you consider

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

them as mere accidents, I will again send you some of these accidents as
you call them, but of a more serious and troublesome character. This is
expressed in the words: "If ye walk with me by chance: then I will walk
with you also in the fury of chance" (*ibid*. vers. 27, 28). For the
belief of the people that their troubles are mere accidents causes them
to continue in their evil principles and their wrong actions, and
prevents them from abandoning their evil ways. Comp. "Thou hast stricken
them, but they have not grieved" (Jer. v. 3). For this reason God
commanded us to pray to Him, to entreat Him, and to cry before Him in
time of trouble. It is clear that repentance is likewise included in
this class; that is to say, it is one of those principles which are an
indispensable element in the creed of the followers of the Law. For it
is impossible for man to be entirely free from error and sin; he either
does not know the opinion which he has to choose, or he adopts a
principle, not for its own merits, but in order to gratify his desire or
passion. If we were convinced that we could never make our crooked ways
straight, we should for ever continue in our errors, and perhaps add
other sins to them since we did not see that any remedy was left to us.
But the belief in the effect of repentance causes us to improve, to
return to the best of the ways, and to become more perfect than we were
before we sinned. For this reason many things are prescribed for the
promotion of this very useful principle: e.g., confessions and
sacrifices for sins committed unknowingly, and in some cases even for
sins committed intentionally, and fasts, and that which is common to all
cases of repentance from sin, the resolve to discontinue sinning. For
that is the aim of this principle. Of all these precepts the use is
obvious.
