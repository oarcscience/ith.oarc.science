### CHAPTER LIV

THE wisest man, our Teacher Moses, asked two things of God, and received
a reply respecting both. The one thing he asked was, that God should let
him know His true essence: the other, which in fact he asked first, that
God should let him know His attributes. In answer to both these
petitions God promised that He would let him know all His attributes,
and that these were nothing but His actions. He also told him that His
true essence could not be perceived, and pointed out a method by which
he could obtain the utmost knowledge of God possible for man to acquire.
The knowledge obtained by Moses has not been possessed by any human
being before him or after him. His petition to know the attributes of
God is contained in the following words: "Show me now thy way, that I
may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight" (Exod. xxxiii. 13).
Consider how many excellent ideas found expression in the words, "Show
me thy way, that I may know thee." We learn from them that God is known
by His attributes, for Moses believed that he knew Him, when he was
shown the way of God. The words "That I may find grace in thy sight,"
imply that he who knows God finds grace in His eyes. Not only is he
acceptable and welcome to God who fasts and prays, but everyone who
knows Him. He who has no knowledge of God is the object of His wrath and
displeasure. The pleasure and the displeasure of God, the approach to
Him and the withdrawal from Him are proportional to the amount of man's
knowledge or ignorance concerning the Creator. We have already gone too
far away from our subject, let us now return to it.

Moses prayed to God to grant him knowledge of His attributes, and also
pardon for His people; when the latter had been granted, he continued to
pray for the knowledge of God's essence in the words, "Show me thy
glory" (*ib*. 18), and then received, respecting his first request,
"Show me thy way," the following favourable reply, "I will make all my
goodness to pass before thee" (*ib*. 19); as regards the second request,
however, he was told, "Thou canst not see my face" (*ib*. 20). The words
"all my goodness" imply that God promised to show him the whole
creation, concerning which it has been stated, "And God saw everything
that he had made, and, behold, it was very good" (Gen. i. 31); when I
say "to show him the whole creation," I mean to imply that God promised
to make him comprehend the nature of all things, their relation to each
other, and the way they are governed by God both in reference to the
universe as a whole and to each creature in particular. This knowledge
is referred to when we are told of Moses," he is firmly established in
all mine house" (Num. xii. 7); that is, "his knowledge of all the
creatures in My universe is correct and firmly established"; for false
opinions are not firmly established. Consequently the knowledge of the
works of God is the knowledge of His attributes, by which He can be
known. The fact that God promised Moses to give him a knowledge of His
works, may be inferred from the circumstance that God taught him such
attributes as refer exclusively to His works, viz., "merciful and
gracious, longsuffering and abundant in goodness," etc., (Exod. xxxiv.
6). It is therefore clear that the ways which Moses wished to know, and
which God taught him, are the actions emanating from God. Our Sages call
them *middot* 

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (qualities), and
speak of the thirteen *middoth* of God (Talm. B. Rosh ha-shanah, p.
17*b*); they used the term also in reference to man; comp. "there are
four different *middoth* (characters) among those who go to the house of
learning"; "There are four different *middoth* (characters) among those
who give charity" (*Mishnah Abot*, v. 13, 14). They do not mean to say
that God really possesses *middot* (qualities), but that He performs
actions similar to such of our actions as originate in certain
qualities, i.e., in certain psychical dispositions not that God has
really such dispositions. Although Moses was shown "all His goodness,"
i.e., all His works, only the thirteen middot are mentioned, because
they include those acts of God which refer to the creation and the
government of mankind, and to know these acts was the principal object
of the prayer of Moses. This is shown by the conclusion of his prayer,
"that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight, and consider
that this nation is thy people" (Exod. xxxiii. 16), that is to say, the
people whom I have to rule by certain acts in the performance of which I
must be guided by Thy own acts in governing them. We have thus shown
that "the ways" used in the Bible, and "*middot*" used in the Mishnah,
are identical, denoting the acts emanating from God in reference to the
universe.

Whenever any one of His actions is perceived by us, we ascribe to God
that emotion which is the source of the act when performed by ourselves,
and call Him by an epithet which is formed from the verb expressing that
emotion. We see, e.g., how well He provides for the life of the embryo
of living beings; how He endows with certain faculties both the embryo
itself and those who have to rear it after its birth, in order that it
may be protected from death and destruction, guarded against all harm,
and assisted in the performance of all that is required \[for its
development\]. Similar acts, when performed by us, are due to a certain
emotion and tenderness called mercy and pity. God is, therefore, said to
be merciful: e.g., "Like as a father is merciful to his children, so the
Lord is merciful to them that fear Him" (Ps. ciii. 13); "And I will
spare them, as a man spareth (*yaḥamol*) his own son that serveth him"
(Mal. iii. 17). Such instances do not imply that God is influenced by a
feeling of mercy, but that acts similar to those which a father performs
for his son, out of pity, mercy and real affection, emanate from God
solely for the benefit of His pious men, and are by no means the result
of any impression or change--\[produced in God\].--When we give
something to a person who has no claim upon us, we perform an act of
grace; e.g., "Grant them graciously unto us" (Judges xxi. 22). \[The
same term is used in reference to God, e.g.\] "which God hath graciously
given" (Gen. xxxiii. 5); "Because God hath dealt graciously with me"
(*ib*. 11). Instances of this kind are numerous. God creates and guides
beings who have no claim upon Him to be created and guided by Him; He is
therefore called gracious (*ḥannun*)--His actions towards mankind also
include great calamities, which overtake individuals and bring death to
them, or affect whole families and even entire regions, spread death,
destroy generation after generation, and spare nothing whatsoever. Hence
there occur inundations, earthquakes, destructive storms, expeditions of
one nation against the other for the sake of destroying it with the
sword and blotting out its memory, and many other evils of the same
kind. Whenever such evils are caused by us to any person,

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

they originate in great anger, violent jealousy, or a desire for
revenge. God is therefore called, because of these acts, "jealous,"
"revengeful," "wrathful," and "keeping anger" (Nah. i. 2) that is to
say, He performs acts similar to those which, when performed by us,
originate in certain psychical dispositions, in jealousy, desire for
retaliation, revenge, or anger: they are in accordance with the guilt of
those who are to be punished, and not the result of any emotion: for He
is above all defect! The same is the case with all divine acts: though
resembling those acts which emanate from our passions and psychical
dispositions, they are not due to anything superadded to His
essence.--The governor of a country, if he is a prophet, should conform
to these attributes. Acts \[of punishment\] must be performed by him
moderately and in accordance with justice, not merely as an outlet of
his passion. He must not let loose his anger, nor allow his passion to
overcome him: for all passions are bad, and they must be guarded against
as far as it lies in man's power. At times and towards some persons he
must be merciful and gracious, not only from motives of mercy and
compassion, but according to their merits: at other times and towards
other persons he must evince anger, revenge, and wrath in proportion to
their guilt, but not from motives of passion. He must be able to condemn
a person to death by fire without anger, passion, or loathing against
him, and must exclusively be guided by what he perceives of the guilt of
the person, and by a sense of the great benefit which a large number
will derive from such a sentence. You have, no doubt, noticed in the
Torah how the commandment to annihilate the seven nations, and "to save
alive nothing that breatheth" (Deut. xx. 16) is followed immediately by
the words, "That they teach you not to do after all their abominations,
which they have done unto their gods: so should you sin against the Lord
your God" (*ib*. 18); that is to say, you shall not think that this
commandment implies an act of cruelty or of retaliation; it is an act
demanded by the tendency of man to remove everything that might turn him
away from the right path, and to clear away all obstacles in the road to
perfection, that is, to the knowledge of God. Nevertheless, acts of
mercy, pardon, pity, and grace should more frequently be performed by
the governor of a country than acts of punishment; seeing that all the
thirteen *middoth* of God are attributes of mercy with only one
exception, namely, "visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
children" (Exod. xxxiv. 7); for the meaning of the preceding attribute
(in the original *ve-nakkeh lo yenakkeh*) is "and he will not utterly
destroy"; (and not "He will by no means clear the guilty"); comp. "And
she will be utterly destroyed (*ve-nikketah*), she shall sit upon the
ground" (Isa. iii. 26). When it is said that God is visiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the children, this refers exclusively to
the sin of idolatry, and to no other sin. That this is the case may be
inferred from what is said in the ten commandments, "upon the third and
fourth generation of my enemies" (Exod. xx. 5), none except idolaters
being called "enemy"; comp. also "every abomination to the Lord, which
he hateth" (Deut. xii. 31). It was, however, considered sufficient to
extend the punishment to the fourth generation, because the fourth
generation is the utmost a man can see of his posterity; and when,
therefore, the idolaters of a place are destroyed, the old man
worshipping idols is killed, his son, his grandson, and his
great-grandson, that is, the fourth generation.

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> By the mention of
this attribute we are, as it were, told that His commandments,
undoubtedly in harmony with His acts, include the death even of the
little children of idolaters because of the sin of their fathers and
grandfathers. This principle we find frequently applied in the Law, as,
e.g., we read concerning the city that has been led astray to idolatry,
"destroy it utterly, and all that is therein" (Deut. xiii. 15). All this
has been ordained in order that every vestige of that which would lead
to great injury should he blotted out, as we have explained.

We have gone too far away from the subject of this chapter, but we have
shown why it has been considered sufficient to mention only these
(thirteen) out of all His acts: namely, because they are required for
the good government of a country; for the chief aim of man should be to
make himself, as far as possible, similar to God: that is to say, to
make his acts similar to the acts of God, or as our Sages expressed it
in explaining the verse, "Ye shall be holy" (Lev. xxi. 2): "He is
gracious, so be you also gracious: He is merciful, so be you also
merciful."

The principal object of this chapter was to show that all attributes
ascribed to God are attributes of His acts, and do not imply that God
has any qualities.
