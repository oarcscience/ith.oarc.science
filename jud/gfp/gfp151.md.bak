### CHAPTER XV

THAT which is impossible has a permanent and constant property, which is
not the result of some agent, and cannot in any way change, and
consequently we do not ascribe to God the power of doing what is
impossible. No thinking man denies the truth of this maxim; none ignore
it, but such as have no idea of Logic. There is, however, a difference
of opinion among philosophers with reference to the existence of any
particular thing. Some of them consider its existence to be impossible,
and hold that God cannot produce the thing in question, whilst others
think that it is possible, and that God can create it if He pleases to
do so. E.g., all philosophers consider that it is impossible for one
substratum to have at the same moment two opposite properties, or for
the elementary components of a thing, substance and accident, to
interchange, so that the substance becomes accident, and the accident
becomes substance, or for a material substance to be without accident.
Likewise it is impossible that God should produce a being like Himself,
or annihilate, corporify, or change Himself. The power of God is not
assumed to extend to any of these impossibilities. But the existence of
accidents independent of substance is possible according to one class of
philosophers, the Mutazilah, whilst according to others it is
impossible; it must, however, be added that those who admit the
existence of an accident independent of substance, have not arrived at
this conclusion by philosophical research alone: but it was mainly by
the desire to defend certain religious principles, which speculation had
greatly shaken, that they had recourse to this theory. In a similar
manner the creation of corporeal things, otherwise than from a
substance, is possible according to our view, whilst the philosophers
say that it is impossible. Again, whilst philosophers say that it is
impossible to produce a square with a diagonal equal to one of the
sides, or a solid angle that includes four right angles, or similar
things, it is thought possible by some persons who are ignorant of
mathematics, and who only know the words of these propositions, but have
no idea of that which is expressed by them. I wonder whether this gate
of research is open, so that all may freely enter, and whilst one
imagines a thing and considers it possible, another is at liberty to
assert that such a thing is impossible by its very nature; or whether
the gate is closed and guarded by certain rules, so that we are able to
decide with certainty whether a thing is physically impossible. I should
also like to know, in the latter case, whether imagination or reason has
to examine and test objects as to their being possible or not; likewise
how things imagined, and things conceived intellectually, are to be
distinguished from each other. For it occurs that we consider a thing as
physically possible, and then some one objects, or we ourselves fear
that our opinion is only the result of imagination, and not that of
reason. In such a case it would be desirable to ascertain whether there
exists some faculty to distinguish between imagination and intellect,
\[and if so,\] whether this faculty is different from both, or whether
it is part of the intellect itself to distinguish between intellectual
and imaginary

objects. All this requires investigation, but it does not belong to the
theme of this chapter.

We have thus shown that according to each one of the different theories
there are things which are impossible, whose existence cannot be
admitted, and whose creation is excluded from the power of God, and the
assumption that God does not change their nature does not imply weakness
in God, or a limit to His power. Consequently things impossible remain
impossible, and do not depend on the action of an agent. It is now clear
that a difference of opinion exists only as to the question to which of
the two classes a thing belongs; whether to the class of the impossible,
or to that of the possible. Note it.
