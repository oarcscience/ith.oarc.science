### CHAPTER IV

THE three verbs *raah*, *hibbit*, and *ḥazah*, which denote "he
perceived with the eye," are also used figuratively in the sense of
intellectual perception. As regards the first of these verbs this is
well known, e.g., And he looked (*va-yar*) and behold a well in the
field" (Gen. xxix. 2) here it signifies ocular perception: "yea, my
heart has seen (*raah*) much of wisdom and of knowledge" (Eccles. i.
16); in this passage it refers to the intellectual perception.

In this figurative sense the verb is to be understood, when applied to
God e.g., "I saw (*raïti*) the Lord" (1 Kings xxii. 19); "And the Lord
appeared (*va-yera*) unto him (Gen. xviii. 1); "And God saw (*va-yar*)
that it was good" (Gen. i. 10) "I beseech thee, show me (*hareni*) thy
glory" (Exod. xxxiii. 18); "And they saw (*va-yirü*) the God of Israel"
(Exod. xxiv. 10). All these instances refer to intellectual perception,
and by no means to perception with the eye as in its literal meaning:
for, on the one hand, the eye can only perceive a corporeal object, and
in connection with it certain accidents, as colour, shape, etc.: and, on
the other hand, God does not perceive by means of a corporeal organ, as
will be explained.

In the same manner the Hebrew *hibbit* signifies "he viewed with the
eye; comp. "Look (*tabbit*) not behind thee" (Gen. xix. 17); "But his
wife looked (*va-tabbet*) back from him" (Gen. xix. 26); "And if one
look (*ve-nibbat*) unto the land" (Isa. v. 30); and figuratively, "to
view and observe" with the intellect, "to contemplate" a thing till it
be understood. In this sense the verb is used in passages like the
following: "He hath not beheld (*hibbit*) iniquity in Jacob" (Num.
xxiii. 21); for "iniquity" cannot be seen with the eye. The words, "And
they looked (*ve-hibbitu*) after Moses" (Exod. xxxiii. 8)--in addition
to the literal understanding of the phrase--were explained by our Sages
in a figurative sense. According to them, these words mean that the
Israelites examined and criticised the actions and sayings of Moses.
Compare also "Contemplate (*habbet*), I pray thee, the heaven"

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Gen. xv. 5); for
this took place in a prophetic vision. This verb, when applied to God,
is employed in this figurative sense; e.g., "to look (*me-habbit*) upon
God" (Exod. iii. 6) "And the similitude of the Lord shall he behold"
(*yabbit*) (Num. xii. 8); And thou canst not look (*habbet*) on
iniquity" (Hab. i. 13).

The same explanation applies to *ḥazah*. It denotes to view with the
eye, as: "And let our eye look (*ve-taḥaz*) upon Zion" (Mic. iv. 11);
and also figuratively, to perceive mentally: "which he saw (*ḥazah*)
concerning Judah and Jerusalem" (Isa. i. 1); "The word of the Lord came
unto Abraham in a vision" (*maḥazeh*) (Gen. xv. 1); in this sense
*ḥazah* is used in the phrase, "Also they saw (*va-yeḥezu*) God" (Exod.
xxiv. 11). Note this well.
