### CHAPTER VII

WE have already explained that the term "angel" is a homonym, and is
used of the intellectual beings, the spheres, and the elements: for all
these are engaged in performing a divine command. But do not imagine
that the Intelligences and the spheres are like other forces which
reside in bodies and act by the laws of nature without being conscious
of what they do. The spheres and the Intelligences are conscious of
their actions, and select by their own free will the objects of their
influence, although not in the same manner as we exercise free will and
rule over other things, which only concern temporary beings. I have been
led to adopt this theory by certain passages in Scripture: e.g., an
angel says to Lot: "For I cannot do anything," etc. (Gen. xix. 21); and
telling him to deliver himself, the angel says: "Behold I have accepted
thee concerning this thing" (ver. 21).

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Again: "Take heed
before him, and listen to his voice," etc. (Exod. xxiii. 21). These
passages show that angels are conscious of what they do, and have free
will in the sphere of action intrusted to them, just as we have free
will within our province, and in accordance with the power given to us
with our very existence. The difference is that what we do is the lowest
stage of excellence, and that our influence and actions are preceded by
non-action; whilst the Intelligences and the spheres always perform that
which is good, they contain nothing except what is good and perfect, as
will be shown further on, and they have continually been active from the
beginning.
