### CHAPTER XLVII

IT is undoubtedly clear and evident that most prophecies are given in
images, for this is the characteristic of the imaginative faculty, the
organ of prophecy. We find it also necessary to say a few words on the
figures, hyperboles, and exaggerations that occur in Scripture. They
would create strange ideas if we were to take them literally without
noticing the exaggeration which they contain, or if we were to
understand them in accordance with the original meaning of the terms,
ignoring the fact that these are used figuratively. Our Sages say
distinctly Scripture uses hyperbolic or exaggerated language and quote
as an instance, "cities walled and fortified, rising up to heaven"
(Deut. i. 28). As a hyperbole our Sages quote, "For the bird of heaven
carries the voice" (Eccles. x. 20); in the same sense it is said, "Whose
height is like that of cedar trees" (Amos ii. 9). Instances of this kind
are frequent in the language of all prophets; what they say is
frequently hyperbolic or

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

exaggerated, and not precise or exact. What Scripture says about Og,
"Behold, his bedstead was an iron bedstead, nine cubits its length,"
etc. (Deut.), does not belong to this class of figures, for the bedstead
(*eres*, comp. *arsenu*, Song of Sol. i. 16) is never exactly, of the
same dimensions as the person using it; it is not like a dress that fits
round the body; it is always greater than the person that sleeps
therein; as a rule, is it by a third longer. If, therefore, the bed of
Og was nine cubits in length, he must, according to this proportion,
have been six cubits high, or a little more. The words, "by the cubit of
a man," mean, by the measure of an ordinary man, and not by the measure
of Og; for men have the limbs in a certain proportion. Scripture thus
tells us that Og was double as long as an ordinary person, or a little
less. This is undoubtedly an exceptional height among men, but not quite
impossible. As regards the Scriptural statement about the length of
man's life in those days, I say that only the persons named lived so
long, whilst other people enjoyed the ordinary length of life. The men
named were exceptions, either in consequence of different causes, as
e.g., their food or mode of living, or by way of miracle, which admits
of no analogy.

We must further discuss the figurative language employed in Scripture.
In some cases this is clear and evident, and doubted by no person: e.g.,
"The mountains and hills shall break forth in song before you, and all
the trees of the wood clap their hands" (Isa. Iv. 12); this is evidently
figurative language; also the following passage--"The fir-trees rejoice
at thee," etc. (*ibid*. xiv. 8), which is rendered by Jonathan, son of
Uzziel, "The rulers rejoice at thee, who are rich in possessions." This
figure is similar to that used in the phrase, "Butter of kine and milk
of sheep," etc. (Deut. xxxii. 14).

And these figures are very frequent in the books of the prophets. Some
are easily recognised by the ordinary reader as figures, others with
some difficulty. Thus nobody doubts that the blessing, "May the Lord
open to thee his good treasure, the heavens," must be taken
figuratively; for God has no treasure in which He keeps the rain. The
same is the case with the following passage--"He opened the doors of
heaven, he rained upon them manna to eat" (Ps. lxxviii. 23, 24). No
person assumes that there is a door or gate in heaven, but every one
understands that this is a simile and a figurative expression. In the
same way must be understood the following passages--"The heavens were
opened" (Ezek. i. 1); "If not, blot me out from thy book which thou hast
written" (Exod. xxxii. 32); "I will blot him out from the book of life"
(*ibid*. ver. 33). All these phrases are figurative: and we must not
assume that God has a book in which He writes, or from which He blots
out, as those generally believe that do not find figurative speech in
these passages. They are all of the same kind. You must explain passages
not quoted by me by those which I have quoted in this chapter. Employ
your reason, and you will be able to discern what is said allegorically,
figuratively, or hyperbolically, and what is meant literally, exactly
according to the original meaning of the words. You will then understand
all prophecies, learn and retain rational principles of faith, pleasing
in the eyes of God who is most pleased with truth, and most displeased
with falsehood; your mind and heart will not be so perplexed as to
believe or accept as law what is untrue or improbable, whilst the Law is
perfectly true when properly understood. Thus Scripture says, "Thy
testimonies are righteousness for ever"

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Ps. cxix. 144);
and "I the Lord speak righteousness" (Isa. xlv. 19). If you adopt this
method, you will not imagine the existence of things which God has not
created, or accept principles which might partly lead to atheism, or to
a corruption of your notions of God so as to ascribe to Him
corporeality, attributes, or emotions, as has been shown by us, nor will
you believe that the words of the prophets are false: for the cause of
this disease is ignorance of what we have explained. These things belong
likewise to the mysteries of the Law; and although we have treated them
in a general manner, they can easily be understood in all their details
in accordance with the above remarks.
