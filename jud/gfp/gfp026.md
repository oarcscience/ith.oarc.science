### CHAPTER XVI

THE word *ẓur* (rock) is a homonym. First, it denotes "rock," as "And
thou shalt smite the rock" (*ẓur*) (Exod. xvii. 6). Then, "hard stone,"
like the flint, e.g., "Knives of stone" (*ẓurim*) (Josh. V. 2). It is
next employed to signify the quarry from which the stones are hewn;
comp. "Look unto the rock (*ẓur*) whence ye are hewn" (Isa. li. 1). From
this latter meaning of the term another figurative notion was
subsequently derived, viz., "the root and origin" of all things. It is
on this account that after the words "Look to the rock whence ye are
hewn," the Prophet continues, "Look unto Abraham your father," from
which we evidently may infer that the words "Abraham your father" serve
to explain "the rock whence ye are hewn"; and that the Prophet meant to
say, "Walk in his ways, put faith in his instruction, and conduct
yourselves according to the rule of his life! for the properties
contained in the quarry should be found again in those things which are
formed and hewn out of it."

It is in the latter sense that the Almighty is called "rock," He being
the origin and the *causa efficiens* of all things besides Himself. Thus
we read, "He is the Rock, His work is perfect" (Deut. xxxii. 4); "Of the
Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful" (Deut. xxxii. 18); "Their Rock
had sold them" (xxxi. 30); "There is no rock like our God" (1 Sam. ii.
2); "The Rock of Eternity" (Isa. xxvi. 4). Again, "And thou shalt stand
upon the Rock" (Exod. xxxiii. 21), i.e., Be firm and steadfast in the
conviction that God is the source of all things, for this will lead you
towards the knowledge of the Divine Being. We have shown (chap. viii.)
that the words "Behold, a place is with me" (Exod. xxxiii. 21) contain
the same idea.
