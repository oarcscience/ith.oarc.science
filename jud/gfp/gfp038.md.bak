### CHAPTER XXVIII

THE term *regel* is homonymous, signifying, in the first place, the foot
of a living being; comp. "Foot for foot" (Exod. xxi. 24). Next it
denotes an object which follows another: comp. "And all the people that
follow thee" (lit. that are at thy feet) (*ib*. xi. 18). Another
signification of the word is "cause"; comp. "And the Lord hath blessed
thee, I being the cause" (*leragli*) (Gen. xxx. 30), i.e., for my sake;
for that which exists for the sake of another thing has the latter for
its final cause. Examples of the term used in this sense are numerous.
It has that meaning in Genesis xxxiii. 14, "Because (*leregel*) of the
cattle that goeth before me, and because (*leregel*) of the children."

Consequently, the Hebrew text, of which the literal rendering is: "And
his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives" (Zech. xiv.
4) can be explained in the following way: "And the things caused by him
(*raglav*) on that day upon the Mount of Olives, that is to say, the
wonders which will then be seen, and of which God will be the Cause or
the Maker, will remain permanently." To this explanation does Jonathan
son of Uziel incline in paraphrasing the passage," And he will appear in
his might on that day upon the Mount of Olives. He generally expresses
terms denoting those parts of the body by which contact and motion are
effected, by "his might" \[when referring to God\], because all such
expressions denote acts done by His Will.

In the passage (Exod. xxiv. 10, lit., "And there was under his feet,
like the action of the whiteness of a sapphire stone"), Onkelos, as you
know, in his version, considers the word (*raglav*) "his feet" as a
figurative expression and a substitute for "throne"; the words "under
his feet" he therefore paraphrases, "And under the throne of his glory."
Consider this well, and you will observe with wonder how Onkelos keeps
free from the idea of the corporeality of God, and from everything that
leads thereto, even in the remotest degree. For he does not say, "and
under His throne"; the direct relation of the throne to God, implied in
the literal sense of the phrase "His throne," would necessarily suggest
the idea that God is supported by a material object, and thus lead
directly to the corporeality of God: he therefore refers the throne to
His glory, i.e., to the Shekhinah, which is a light created for the
purpose.

Similarly he paraphrases the words, "For my hand I lift up to the throne
of God" (Exod. xvii. 16), "An oath has been uttered by God, whose
Shekhinah is upon the throne of his glory." This principle found also
expression in the popular phrase, "the Throne of the Glory."

We have already gone too far away from the subject of this chapter, and
touched upon things which will be discussed in other chapters; we will
now return to our present theme. You are acquainted with the version of
Onkelos \[of the passage quoted\]. He contents himself with excluding
from his version all expressions of corporeality in reference to God,
and does not show us what they (the nobles of the children of Israel
Exod. xxiv. 10) perceived,

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

or what is meant by that figure. In all similar instances Onkelos also
abstains from entering into such questions, and only endeavours to
exclude every expression implying corporeality; for the incorporeality
of God is a demonstrative truth and an indispensable element in our
faith; he could decidedly state all that was necessary in that respect.
The interpretation of a simile is a doubtful thing: it may possibly have
that meaning, but it may also refer to something else. It contains
besides very profound matter, the understanding of which is not a
fundamental element in our faith, and the comprehension of which is not
easy for the common people. Onkelos, therefore, did not enter at all
into this subject.

We, however, remaining faithful to our task in this treatise, find
ourselves compelled to give our explanation. According to our opinion
"under his feet" (*raglav*) denotes "under that of which He is the
cause," "that which exists through Him," as we have already stated. They
(the nobles of the children of Israel) therefore comprehended the real
nature of the *materia prima*, which emanated from Him, and of whose
existence He is the only cause. Consider well the phrase, "like the
action of the whiteness of the sapphire stone." If the colour were the
point of comparison, the words, "as the whiteness of the sapphire stone"
would have sufficed; but the addition of "like the action" was
necessary, because matter, as such, is, as you are well aware, always
receptive and passive, active only by some accident. On the other hand,
form, as such, is always active, and only passive by some accident, as
is explained in works on Physics. This explains the addition of "*like*
the action" in reference to the *materia prima*. The expression "the
whiteness of the sapphire" refers to the transparency, not to the white
colour: for "the whiteness" of the sapphire is not a white colour, but
the property of being transparent. Things, however, which are
transparent, have no colour of their own, as is proved in works on
Physics: for if they had a colour they would not permit all the colours
to pass through them nor would they receive colours: it is only when the
transparent object is totally colourless, that it is able to receive
successively all the colours. In this respect it (the whiteness of the
sapphire) is like the *materia prima*, which as such is entirely
formless, and thus receives all the forms one after the other. What they
(the nobles of the children of Israel) perceived was therefore the
*materia prima*, whose relation to God is distinctly mentioned, because
it is the source of those of his creatures which are subject to genesis
and destruction, and has been created by him. This subject also will be
treated later on more fully.

Observe that you must have recourse to an explanation of this kind, even
when adopting the rendering of Onkelos, "And under the throne of His
glory"; for in fact the *materia prima* is also under the heavens, which
are called "throne of God," as we have remarked above. I should not have
thought of this unusual interpretation, or hit on this argument were it
not for an utterance of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, which will be discussed
in one of the parts of this treatise (II. chap. xxvi.). The primary
object of every intelligent person must be to deny the corporeality of
God, and to believe that all those perceptions (described in the above
passage) were of a spiritual not of a material character. Note this and
consider it well.
