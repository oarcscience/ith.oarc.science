### CHAPTER XIII

THE term *‘amad* (he stood) is a homonym signifying in the first
instance "to stand upright," as "When he stood (*be-‘omdo*) before
Pharaoh" (Gen. xli. 46); "Though Moses and Samuel stood (*ya‘amod*)"
(Jer. xv. 1); "He stood by them" (Gen. xviii. 8). It further denotes
"cessation and interruption," as "but they stood still (*‘amedu*) and
answered no more" (Job xxxii. 16); "and she ceased (*va-ta‘amod*) to
bear" (Gen. xxix. 35). Next it signifies "to be enduring and lasting,"
as, "that they may continue (*yo‘amedu*) many days" (Jer. xxxii. 14);
"Then shalt thou be able to endure (*‘amod*)" (Exod. xviii. 23); "His
taste remained (*‘amad*) in him" (Jer. xlviii. 11), i.e., it has
continued and remained in existence without any change: "His
righteousness standeth for ever" (Ps. cxi. 3), i.e., it is permanent and
everlasting. The verb applied to God must be understood in this latter
sense, as in Zechariah xiv. 4, "And his feet shall stand (*ve-‘amedu*)
in that day upon the Mount of Olives" (Zech. xiv. 4), "His causes, i.e.,
the events of which He is the cause, will remain efficient," etc. This
will be further elucidated when we speak of the meaning of *regel*
(foot). (*Vide infra*, chap. xxviii.) In the same sense is this verb
employed in Deuteronomy v. 28, "But as for thee, stand thou here by me,"
and Deuteronomy v. 5, "I stood between the Lord and you."
