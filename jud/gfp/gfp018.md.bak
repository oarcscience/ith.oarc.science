### CHAPTER VIII

ORIGINALLY the Hebrew term *makom* (place) applied both to a particular
spot and to space in general subsequently it received a wider
signification and denoted "position," or "degree," as regards the
perfection of man in certain things. We say, e.g., this man occupies a
certain place in such and such a subject. In this sense this term, as is
well known, is frequently used by authors, e.g., "He fills his
ancestors' place (*makom*) in point of wisdom

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

and piety"; "the dispute still remains in its place" (*makom*), i.e.,
*in statu quo* \[*ante*\]. In the verse, "Blessed be the glory of the
Lord from His place" (*mekomo*) (Ezek. iii. 12), *makom* has this
figurative meaning, and the verse may be paraphrased "Blessed be the
Lord according to the exalted nature of His existence," and wherever
*makom* is applied to God, it expresses the same idea, namely, the
distinguished position of His existence, to which nothing is equal or
comparable, as will be shown below (chap. lvi.).

It should be observed that when we treat in this work of any homonym, we
do not desire you to confine yourself to that which is stated in that
particular chapter; but we open for you a portal and direct your
attention to those significations of the word which are suited to our
purpose, though they may not be complete from a philological point of
view. You should examine the prophetical books and other works composed
by men of science, notice the meaning of every word which occurs in
them, and take homonyms in that sense which is in harmony with the
context. What I say in a particular passage is a key for the
comprehension of all similar passages. For example, we have explained
here *makom* in the sentence "Blessed be the glory of the Lord from His
place" (*mekomo*); but you must understand that the word makom has the
same signification in the passage "Behold, a place (*makom*) is with me"
(Exod. xxxiii. 26), viz., a certain degree of contemplation and
intellectual intuition (not of ocular inspection), in addition to its
literal [meaning](errata.htm#3.md) "a place," viz., the mountain which was
pointed out to Moses for seclusion and for the attainment of perfection.
