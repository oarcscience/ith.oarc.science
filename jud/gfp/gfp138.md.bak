### CHAPTER II

THE prophet says that he saw four *Ḥayyot*: each of them had four faces,
four wings, and two hands, but on the whole their form was human. Comp.
"They had the likeness of a man" (Ezek. i. 5). The hands are also
described

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

as human hands, because these have undoubtedly, as is well known, such a
form as enables them to perform all manner of cunning work. Their feet
are straight that is to say, they are without joints. This is the
meaning of the phrase "a straight foot," taken literally. Similarly our
Sages say, the words, "And their feet were straight feet" (*ibid*. i.
7), show that the beings above do not sit. Note this likewise. The soles
of the feet of the *Ḥayyot*, the organs of walking, are described as
different from the feet of man, but the hands are like human hands. The
feet are round, for the prophet says, "like the sole of a round foot."
The four *Ḥayyot* are closely joined together, there is no space or
vacuum left between them. Comp. "They were joined one to another"
(*ibid*. i. 9)." But although they were thus joined together, their
faces and their wings were separated above" (*ibid*. ver. 11). Consider
the expression "above" employed here, although the bodies were closely
joined, their faces and their wings were separated, but only above. The
prophet then states that they are transparent; they are "like burnished
brass" (*ibid*. ver, 7). He also adds that they are luminous. Comp.
"Their appearance was like burning coals of fire" (*ibid*. ver. 13).
This is all that has been said as regards the form, shape, face, figure,
wings, hands, and feet of the *Ḥayyot*. The prophet then begins to
describe the motions of these *Ḥayyot*, namely, that they have a uniform
motion, without any curvature, deviation, or deflexion: "They turned not
when they went" (ver. 17). Each of the *Ḥayyot* moves in the direction
of its face. Comp. "They went every one in the direction of his face"
(ver. 9). Now, it is here clearly stated that each *Ḥayyah* went in the
direction of its face, but since each Hayyah has several faces, I ask,
in the direction of which face? In short, the four *Ḥayyot* do not move
in the same direction; for, if this were the case, a special motion
would not have been ascribed to each of them: it would not have been
said, "They went each one towards the side of his face." The motion of
these *Ḥayyot* is further described as a running, so also their
returning is described as a running. Comp. "And the *Ḥayyot* ran, and
returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning" (ver. 14), *raẓoh*
being the infinitive of *ruẓ*, "to run, "and *shob* the infinitive
instead of *ŝhub*, "to return." The ordinary words, *haloch* and *bo*,
"to go" and "to come, "are not used, but such words as indicate running
to and fro: and these are further explained by the phrase, "As the
appearance of a flash of lightning" (*bazak*, used by the prophet, is
identical with *barak*), for the lightning appears to move very quickly;
it seems to hasten and to run from a certain place, and then to turn
back and to come again to the place from which it had started. This is
repeated several times with the same velocity. Jonathan, the son of
Uzziel, renders the phrase *raẓo vashob* thus: They move round the world
and return at once, and are as swift as the appearance of lightning.
This quick movement and return the *Hayyah* does not perform of its own
accord, but through something outside of it, viz., the Divine Will; for
"to whichever side it is the Divine Will that the *Hayyah* should move,
thither the *Ḥayyah* moves," in that quick manner which is expressed by
"running and returning." This is implied in the words, "Whithersoever
the spirit was to go they went (ver. 20); "They turned not when they
went" (ver. 17). By "the spirit" (*ruaḥ*), the prophet does not mean
"the wind," but "the intention," as we have explained when discussing
the homonym *ruaḥ*

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (spirit). The
meaning of the phrase is, that whithersoever it is the Divine Will that
the *Ḥayyah* shall go, thither it runs. Jonathan, the son of Uzziel,
gives a similar explanation: Towards the place whither it is the will to
go, they go; they do not turn when they go. The employment of the future
tense of the verbs *yihyeh* and *yeleku* in this passage seems to imply
that sometimes it will be the will of God that the Hayyah should move in
one direction, in which it will in fact move, and at other times it will
be His will that the Hayyah should move in the opposite direction, in
which it will then move. An explanation is, however, added, which is
contrary to/this conclusion, and shows that the future form (*yihyeh*)
of the verb has here the meaning of the preterite, as is frequently the
case in Hebrew. The direction in which God desires the *Ḥayyah* to move
has already been determined and fixed, and the Hayyah moves in that
direction which His will has determined long ago, without having ever
changed. The prophet, therefore, in explaining, and at the same time
concluding \[this description of the *Ḥayyot*\], says, "Whithersoever
the spirit was to go they go, thither *was* the spirit to go" (ver. 20).
Note this wonderful interpretation. This passage forms likewise part of
the account of the motion of the four *Ḥayyot* which follows the
description of their form.

Next comes the description of another part; for the prophet relates that
he saw a body beneath the *Ḥayyot*, but closely joining them. This body,
which is connected with the earth, consists likewise of four bodies, and
has also four faces. But no distinct form is ascribed to it: neither
that of man nor that of any other living being. The \[four bodies\] are
described as great, tremendous, and terrible; no form is given to them,
except that they are covered with eyes. These are the bodies called
*Ofannim* (lit. wheels). The prophet therefore says: "Now, as I beheld
the *Ḥayyot*, behold one wheel upon the earth beside the living
creatures, with his four faces" (ver. 15). He thus distinctly states
that the *Ofannim* form a body, of which the one part touches the
*Ḥayyot*, and the other part the earth; and that the *Ofan* has four
faces. But he continues--"The appearance of the *Ofannim* (wheels) and
their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one
likeness" (ver. 16). By speaking of four *Ofannim*, after having
mentioned only one *Ofan*, the prophet indicates that the "four faces"
and the "four *Ofannim*" are identical. These four *Ofannim* have the
same form; comp., "And they four had one likeness." The *Ofannim* are
then described as partly inter-joined; for" their appearance and their
work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel (ver. 16). In the
description of the *Ḥayyot* such a phrase, with the term "in the middle
of" (*tok*) is not employed. The *Ḥayyot* are partly joined, according
to the words, "they were joined one to another" (ver. 11); whilst in
reference to the *Ofannim* it is stated that they are partly intermixed,
"as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel" The body of the *Ofannim*
is described as being covered with eyes; it is possible that a body
covered with real eyes is here meant, or a body with different colours
\[*‘ayin* denoting "eye," also "colour"\], as in the phrase "the colour
thereof \[*‘eno*\] as the colour (*ke‘en*) of bdellium" (Num. xi. 7); or
a body filled with likenesses of things. In this latter sense the term
ayin is used by our Sages in phrases like the following:--Like that
\[*ke‘en*\] which he has stolen, like that \[*ke‘en*\] which he has
robbed; or different

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

properties and qualities are meant, according to the meaning of the word
'ayin in the passage, "It may be that the Lord will look (*be‘enai*) on
my condition" (2 Sam. xvi. 12). So much for the form of the *Ofannim*.
Their motion is described as being without curvature and deviation; as
being straight, without any change. This is expressed in the words,
"When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not
when they went" (E.: ver. 117). The four *Ofannim* do not move of their
own accord, as the *Ḥayyot*, and have no motion whatever of their own;
they are set in motion by other beings, as is emphatically stated twice.
The *Ḥayyot* are the moving agents of the *Ofannim*. The relation
between the *Ofan* and the *Ḥayyah* may be compared to the relation
between a lifeless body tied to the hand or the leg of a living animal;
whithersoever the latter moves, thither moves also the piece of wood, or
the stone, which is tied to the named limb of the animal. This is
expressed in the following words:--"And when the *Ḥayyot* went, the
*Ofannim* went by them; and when the living creatures were lifted up
from the earth, the *Ofannim* were lifted up" (ver. 19); "and the
*Ofannim* were lifted up over against them" (ver. 20). And the cause of
this is explained thus:--"The spirit of the Hayyah was in the *Ofannim*"
(*ibid*.). For the sake of emphasis and further explanation the prophet
adds, "When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood;
and when those were lifted up from the earth, the *Ofannim* were lifted
up over against them; for the spirit of the *Ḥayyah* was in the
*Ofannim*" (ver. 21). The order of these movements is therefore as
follows:--Whithersoever it is the will of God that the *Ḥayyot* should
move, thither they move of their own accord. When the *Ḥayyot* move the
*Ofannim* necessarily follow them, because they are tied to them, and
not because they move of their own accord in the direction in which the
*Ḥayyot* move. This order is expressed in the words, "Whithersoever the
spirit was to go, they went, thither was the spirit to go; and the
*Ofannim* were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the Hayyah
was in the *Ofannim*" (ver. 20). I have told you that Jonathan, the son
of Uzziel, translates the verse thus, "to the place whither it was the
will that the *Ḥayyot* should go," etc.

After having completed the account of the *Ḥayyot*, with their form and
motion, and of the *Ofannim*, which are beneath the *Ḥayyot*, connected
with them and forced to move when the *Ḥayyot* move, the prophet begins
to describe a third object which he perceived prophetically, and gives
the account of a new thing, viz., of that which is above the *Ḥayyot*.
He says that the firmament is above the four *Ḥayyot*, above the
firmament is the likeness of a throne, and over the throne the likeness
of the appearance of mar. This is the whole account of what the prophet
perceived at first at the river Chebar.
