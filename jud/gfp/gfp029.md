### CHAPTER XIX

THE term *male* is a homonym which denotes that one substance enters
another, and fills it, as "And she filled (*va-temalle*) her pitcher"
(Gen. xxiv. 16); "An omer-full (*melo*) for each" (Exod. xvi. 32), and
many other instances. Next, it signifies the expiration or completion of
a fixed period

of time, as "And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled
(*va-yimleü*)" (Gen. xxv. 24); "And forty days were completed
(*va-yimleü*) for him" (Gen. 1. 3). It further denotes attainment of the
highest degree of excellency, as "Full (*male*) with the blessing of the
Lord" (Deut. xxxiii. 23); "Them hath he filled (*mille*) with wisdom of
heart" (Exod. xxxv. 35) He was filled (*va-yimmale*) with wisdom, and
understanding, and cunning" (1 Kings vii. 14). In this sense it is said
"The whole earth is full (*melo*) of his glory" (Isa. vi. 4), "All the
earth gives evidence of his perfection," i.e. leads to a knowledge of
it. Thus also" The glory of the Lord filled (*male*) the tabernacle"
(Exod. xl. 34); and, in fact, every application of the word to God must
be interpreted in this manner; and not that He has a body occupying
space. If, on the other hand, you prefer to think that in this passage
by "the glory of the Lord," a certain light created for the purpose is
to be understood, that such light is always termed "glory," and that
such light "filled the tabernacle," we have no objection.
