### CHAPTER I

IT is well known that there are men whose face is like that of other
animals thus the face of some person is like that of a lion, that of
another person like that of an ox, and so on: and man's face is
described according as the form of his face resembles the form of the
face of other animals. By the expressions, "the face of an ox," "the
face of a lion," "the face of an eagle" (Ezek, i. 10), the prophet
describes a human face inclining towards the forms of these various
species. This interpretation can be supported by two proofs. First, the
prophet says of the *Ḥayyot* in general that" their appearance is this,
they have the form of man" (ver. 5), and then in describing each of the
*Ḥayyot* he attributes to them the face of a man, that of an ox, that of
a lion, and that of an eagle. Secondly, in the second description of the
Chariot, which is intended as a supplement to the first, the prophet
says, Each hath four faces; the one is the face of a cherub, the second
a man's face, the third a lion's face, and the fourth that of an eagle
(*ibid*. x. W. He thus clearly indicates that the terms "the face of an
ox" and "the face of a cherub" are identical. But cherub designates "a
youth." By analogy we explain the two other terms--"the face of a lion"
and "the face of an eagle" in the same manner. "The face of the ox" has
been singled out on account of the etymology of the Hebrew term *shor*
(ox), as has been indicated by me. It is impossible to assume that this
second description refers to the perception of another prophetic vision,
because it concludes thus: "This is the *Ḥayyah* which I saw at the
river Chebar" (*ibid*. ver. 15). What we intended to explain is now
clear.
