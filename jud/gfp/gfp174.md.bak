### CHAPTER XXXVIII

THE precepts of the third class are identical with those which we have
enumerated in *Hilkot de‘ot*. Their use is evident; they are rules
concerning moral conduct by which the social relations of men are
regulated. This is sufficiently clear, and I need not dwell long on it.
Know that some precepts prescribe certain acts which are considered as
arbitrary decrees without any purpose, but are nevertheless the means of
acquiring some moral principle. We shall explain every one of them in
its proper place. But of all those precepts which are mentioned in
Hilkot dew, it is distinctly stated that their object is to inculcate
good moral principles.
