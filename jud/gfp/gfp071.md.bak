### CHAPTER LXI

IT is well known that all the names of God occurring in Scripture are
derived from His actions, except one, namely, the Tetragrammaton, which
consists of the letters *yod*, *hé*, *vau* and *hé*. This name is
applied exclusively to God, and is on that account called *Shem
ha-meforash*, "The *nomen proprium*." It is the distinct and exclusive
designation of the Divine Being; whilst His other names are common
nouns, and are derived from actions, to which some of our own are
similar, as we have already explained. Even the name *Adonay*, "Lord,"
which has been substituted for the Tetragrammaton, is derived from the
appellative "lord"; comp. "The man who is the lord (*adone*) of the land
spake roughly to us" (Gen. xliii. 30). The difference between *Adoni*,
"my lord," (with *ḥirek* under the *nun*), or *Adonay* (with *kameẓ*),
is similar to the difference between *Sari*, "my prince," and

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Saraï*, Abraham's
wife (*ib*. xvi. 1), the latter form denoting majesty and distinction.
An angel is also addressed as "*Adonay*"; e.g., "*Adonay* (My lord),
pass not away, I pray thee" (*ib*. xviii. 3). I have restricted my
explanation to the term *Adonay*, the substitute for the Tetragrammaton,
because it is more commonly applied to God than any of the other names
which are in frequent use, like *dayyan*, "judge," *shadday*,
"almighty," *ẓaddik*, "righteous," *ḥannun*, "gracious," *raḥum*,
"merciful," and *elohim* "chief" all these terms are unquestionably
appellations and derivatives. The derivation of the name, consisting of
*yod*, *hé*, *vau*, and *hé*, is not positively known, the word having
no additional signification. This sacred name, which, as you know, was
not pronounced except in the sanctuary by the appointed priests, when
they gave the sacerdotal blessing, and by the high priest on the Day of
Atonement, undoubtedly denotes something which is peculiar to God, and
is not found in any other being. It is possible that in the Hebrew
language, of which we have now but a slight knowledge, the
Tetragrammaton, in the way it was pronounced, conveyed the meaning of
"absolute existence." In short, the majesty of the name and the great
dread of uttering it, are connected with the fact that it denotes God
Himself, without including in its meaning any names of the things
created by Him. Thus our Sages say: "'My name' (Num. vi. 27) means the
name which is peculiar to Me." All other names of God have reference to
qualities, and do not signify a simple substance, but a substance with
attributes, they being derivatives. On that account it is believed that
they imply the presence of a plurality in God, I mean to say, the
presence of attributes, that is, of some extraneous element superadded
to His essence. Such is the meaning of all derivative names: they imply
the presence of some attribute and its substratum, though this be not
distinctly named. As, however, it has been proved, that God is not a
substratum capable of attributes, we are convinced that those
appellatives when employed as names of God, only indicate the relation
of certain actions to Him, or they convey to us some notion of His
perfection.

Hence R. Ḥaninah would have objected to the expression "the great, the
mighty, and the tremendous," had it not been for the two reasons
mentioned by him; because such expressions lead men to think that the
attributes are essential, i.e., they are perfections actually present in
God. The frequent use of names of God derived from actions, led to the
belief that He had as many \[essential\] attributes as there were
actions from which the names were derived. The following promise was
therefore made, implying that mankind will at a certain future time
understand this subject, and be free from the error it involves: "In
that day will the Lord be One, and His name One" (Zech. xiv. 9). The
meaning of this prophecy is this: He being One, will then be called by
one name, which will indicate the essence of God; but it does not mean
that His sole name will be a derivative \[viz., "One"\]. In the *Pirke
Rabbi Eliezer* (chap. iii.) occurs the following passage: "Before the
universe was created, there was only the Almighty and His name." Observe
how clearly the author states that all these appellatives employed as
names of God came into existence after the Creation. This is true; for
they all refer to actions manifested in the Universe. If, however, you
consider His essence as separate and as abstracted from all

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

actions, you will not describe it by an appellative, but by a proper
noun, which exclusively indicates that essence. Every other name of God
is a derivative, only the Tetragrammaton is a real *nomen proprium*, and
must not be considered from any other point of view. You must beware of
sharing the error of those who write amulets (*kameot*). Whatever you
hear from them, or read in their works, especially in reference to the
names which they form by combination, is utterly senseless; they call
these combinations *shemot* (names) and believe that their pronunciation
demands sanctification and purification, and that by using them they are
enabled to work miracles. Rational persons ought not to listen to such
men, nor in any way believe their assertions. No other name is called
*shem ha-meforash* except this Tetragrammaton, which is written, but is
not pronounced according to its letters. The words, "Thus shall ye bless
the children of Israel" (Num. vi. 23) are interpreted in Siphri as
follows: "'*Thus*,' in the holy language; again '*thus*,' with the *Shem
ha-meforash*." The following remark, is also found there: "In the
sanctuary \[the name of God is pronounced\] as it is spelt, but
elsewhere by its substitutes." In the Talmud, the following passage
occurs: "'*Thus*,' i.e., with the *shem ha-meforash*.--You say \[that
the priests, when blessing the people, had to pronounce\] the *shem
ha-meforash*; this was perhaps not the case, and they may have used
other names instead.--We infer it from the words: 'And they shall put My
name' (Num. vi. 27), i.e., My name, which is peculiar to Me." It has
thus been shown that the *shem ha-meforash* (the proper name of God) is
the Tetragrammaton, and that this is the only name which indicates
nothing but His essence, and therefore our Sages in referring to this
sacred term said "'*My name*' means the one which is peculiar to Me
alone."

In the next chapter I will explain the circumstances which brought men
to a belief in the power of *Shemot* (names of God); I will point out
the main subject of discussion, and lay open to you its mystery, and
then not any doubt will be left in your mind, unless you prefer to be
misguided.
