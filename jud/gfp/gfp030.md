### CHAPTER XX

THE word *ram* (high) is a homonym, denoting elevation in space, and
elevation in dignity, i.e., greatness, honour, and power. It has the
first meaning in "And the ark was lifted up (*va-tarom*) above the
earth" (Gen. vii. 17); and the latter meaning in "I have exalted
(*harimoti*) one chosen out of the people" (Ps. lxxxix. 20); "Forasmuch
as I have exalted (*harimoti*) thee from amongst the dust" (1 Kings xvi.
2); "Forasmuch as I exalted (*harimoti*) thee from among the people" (1
Kings xiv. 7).

Whenever this term is employed in reference to God, it must be taken in
the second sense: "Be thou exalted (*rumah*), O God, above the heavens"
(Ps. lvii. 12). In the same manner does the root *nasa* (to lift up)
denote both elevation in space and elevation in rank and dignity. In the
former sense it occurs in "And they lifted up (*va-yisseü*) their corn
upon their asses" (Gen. xlii. 26) and there are many instances like this
in which this verb has the meaning "to carry," "to move" from place to
place: for this implies elevation in space. In the second sense we have
"And his kingdom shall be exalted" (*ve-tinnase*) (Num. xxiv. 7); "And
he bare them, and carried them" (*va-yenasseëm*) (Isa. lxiii. 9);
"Wherefore do ye exalt yourselves" (*titnasseü*) (Num. xvi. 3).

Every form of this verb when applied to God has this latter sense--e.g.,
"Lift up thyself (*hinnase*), thou judge of the earth" (Ps. xciv. 2);
"Thus saith the High (*ram*) and Exalted (*nissa*) One" (Isa. lvii.
15)--denoting elevation in rank, quality, and power, and not elevation
in space.

You may be surprised that I employ the expression, "elevation in rank,
quality, and power," and you may say, "How can you assert that several
distinct expressions denote the same thing?" It will be explained later
on (chap. 1. *seqq*.) that those who possess a true knowledge of God do
not consider that He possesses many attributes, but believe that these
various attributes which describe His Might, Greatness, Power,
Perfection, Goodness, etc., are identical, denoting His Essence, and not
anything extraneous to His Essence. I shall devote special chapters to
the Names and Attributes of

here is solely to show that "high and exalted" in the passage quoted
denote elevation in rank, not in space.
