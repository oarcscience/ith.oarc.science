### CHAPTER XXXVIII

THE Hebrew term *aḥor* is a homonym. It is a noun, signifying "back."
Comp. "Behind (*aḥare*) the tabernacle" (Exod. xxvi. 12); "The spear
came out behind him (*aḥarav*)" (2 Sam. ii. 23).

It is next used in reference to time, signifying "after"; "neither after
him (*aḥarav*) arose there any like him" (2 Kings xxiii. 25) "After
(*aḥar*) these things" (Gen. xv. 1). In this sense the word occurs
frequently.

The term includes also the idea of following a thing and of conforming
with the moral principles of some other being. Comp. "Ye shall walk
after (*aḥare*) the Lord, your God" (Deut. xiii. 5); "They shall walk
after (*aḥare*) the Lord" (Hos. xi. 10), i.e., follow His will, walk in
the way of His actions, and imitate His virtues: "He walked after
(*aḥare*) the commandment" (*ib*. v.11). In this sense the word occurs
in Exodus xxxiii. 20, "And thou shalt see my back" (*aḥorai*); thou
shalt perceive that which follows me, is similar to me, and is the
result of my will, i.e., all things created by me, as will be explained
in the course of this treatise.
