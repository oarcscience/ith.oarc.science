### CHAPTER XII

THE term *kam* (he rose) is a homonym. In one of its significations it
is the opposite of "to sit," as "He did not rise (*kam*) nor move for
him" (Esth. v. 9). It further denotes the confirmation and verification
of a thing, e.g.: "The Lord will verify (*yakem*) His promise" (1 Sam.
i. 23); "The field of Ephron was made sure (*va-yakom*) as the property
of Abraham" (Gen. xxiii. 17). "The house that is in the walled city
shall be established (*ve-kam*)" (Lev. xxv. 30); "And the kingdom of
Israel shall be firmly established (*ve-kamah*) in thy hand" (1 Sam.
xxiv. 20). It is always in this sense that the verb is employed with
reference to the Almighty; as "Now shall I rise (*akum*), saith the
Lord" (Ps. xii. 7), which is the same as saying, "Now shall I verify my
word and my dispensation for good or evil." "Thou shalt arise (*takum*)
and have mercy upon Zion" (Ps. cii. 13), which means: Thou wilt
establish what thou hast promised, viz., that thou wouldst pity Zion.

Generally a person who resolves to set about a matter, accompanies his
resolve by rising, hence the verb is employed to express "to resolve" to
do a certain thing; as, "That my son hath stirred up my servant against
me" (1 Sam. xxii. 8). The word is figuratively used to signify the
execution of a divine decree against a people sentenced to
extermination, as "And I will rise against the house of Jeroboam" (Amos
vii. 9); "but he win arise against the house of the evildoers" (Isa.
xxxi. 2). Possibly in Psalm xii. 7 the verb has this latter sense, as
also in Psalm cii. 13, namely: Thou wilt rise up against her enemies.

There are many passages to be interpreted in this manner, but in no way
should it be understood that He rises or sits--far be such a notion! Our
Sages expressed this idea in the formula," In the world above there is
neither sitting nor standing (*‘amidah*)"; for the two verbs *‘amad* and
*kam* are synonyms \[and what is said about the former is also
applicable to the latter\].
