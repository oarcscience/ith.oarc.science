### CHAPTER XXX

THERE is a difference between first and beginning (or principle). The
latter exists in the thing of which it is the beginning, or co-exists
with it; it need not precede it; e.g., the heart is the beginning of the
living being; the element is the beginning of that of which it is the
basis. The term "first" is likewise applied to things of this kind; but
is also employed in cases where precedence in time alone is to be
expressed, and the thing which precedes is not the beginning (or the
cause) of the thing that follows. E.g., we say A. was the first
inhabitant of this house, after him came B; this does not imply that A
is the cause of B inhabiting the house. In Hebrew, *teḥillah* is used in
the sense of "first"; e.g., when God first (*teḥillat*) spake to Hosea
(Hos. i. 1), and the "beginning" is expressed by *reshith*, derived from
*rosh*, "head," the principal part of the living being as regards
position. The Universe has not been created out of an element that
preceded it in time, since time itself formed part of the Creation. For
this reason Scripture employs the term "*bereshit*" (in a principle), in
which the *beth* is a preposition denoting "in." The true explanation of
the first verse of Genesis is as follows: "In \[creating\] a principle
God created the beings above and the things below." This explanation is
in accordance with the theory of the Creation. We find that some of our
Sages are reported to have held the opinion that time existed before the
Creation. But this report is very doubtful, because the theory that time
cannot be imagined with a beginning, has been taught by Aristotle, as I
showed you, and is objectionable. Those who have made this assertion
have been led to it by a saying of one of our Sages in reference to the
terms "one day," "a second day." Taking these terms literally, the
author of that saying asked, What determined "the first day," since
there was no rotating sphere, and no sun? and continues as follows:
Scripture uses the term "one day"; R. Jehudah, son of R. Simon, said:
"Hence we learn that the divisions of time have existed previously." R.
Abahu said, "Hence we learn that God built worlds and again destroyed
them." This latter exposition is still worse than the former. Consider
the difficulty which these two Rabbis found in the statement that time
existed before the creation of the sun. We shall undoubtedly soon remove
this difficulty, unless these two Rabbis intended to infer from the
Scriptural text that the divisions of time must have existed before the
Creation, and thus adopted the theory of the Eternity of the Universe.
But every religious man rejects this. The above saying is, in my
opinion, certainly of the same character as that of R. Eliezer, "Whence
were the heavens created," etc., (chap. xxvi.). In short, in these
questions, do not take notice of the utterances of any person. I told
you that the foundation of our faith is the belief that God created the
Universe from nothing; that time did not exist previously, but was
created: for it depends on the motion of the sphere, and the sphere has
been created.

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

You must know that the particle et in the phrase *et ha-shamayim ve-et
ha-areẓ* ("the heavens and the earth") signifies "together with"; our
Sages have explained the word in the same sense in many instances.
Accordingly they assume that God created with the heavens everything
that the heavens contain, and with the earth everything the earth
includes. They further say that the simultaneous Creation of the heavens
and the earth is implied in the words, "I call unto them, they stand up
together" (Ps. xlviii.). Consequently, all things were created together,
but were separated from each other successively. Our Sages illustrated
this by the following simile: We sow various seeds at the same time;
some spring forth after one day, some after two, and some after three
days, although all have been sown at the same time. According to this
interpretation, which is undoubtedly correct, the difficulty is removed,
which led R. Jehudah, son of R. Simon, to utter the above saying, and
consisted in the doubt as to the thing by which the first day, the
second, and the third were determined. In *Bereshit Rabba*, our Sages,
speaking of the light created on the first day according to the
Scriptural account, say as follows: these lights \[of the luminaries
mentioned in the Creation of the fourth day\] are the same that were
created on the first day, but were only fixed in their places on the
fourth day. The meaning \[of the first verse\] has thus been clearly
stated.

We must further consider that the term *ereẓ* is a homonym, and is used
in a general and a particular sense. It has a more general signification
when used of everything within the sphere of the moon, i.e., of all the
four elements; and is used in particular of one of them, of the lowest,
viz., earth. This is evident from the passage: "And the earth was
without form and void, and darkness was on the surface of the deep. And
the wind of God moved upon the face of the waters." The term "earth"
\[mentioned here, and in the first verse\] includes all the four
elements, whilst further on it is said, "And God called the dry land
Earth" (Gen. i. 10).

It is also important to notice that the words, "And God called a certain
thing a certain name," are invariably intended to distinguish one thing
from others which are called by the same common noun. I explain,
therefore, the first verse in Genesis thus: In creating the principle
God created the things above and those below. *Ereẓ* in this verse
denotes" the things below," or "the four elements," and in the verse,
"And God called the dry land Earth" (*ereẓ*), it signifies the element
earth. This subject is now made clear.

The four elements indicated, according to our explanation, in the term
*ereẓ* "earth," in the first verse, are mentioned first after the
heavens: for there are named *ereẓ* (earth), *ruaḥ* (air), *mayim*
(water), and *hoshek* (fire). By *ḥoshek* the element fire is meant,
nothing else; comp. "And thou heardest his words out of the midst of the
fire" (Deut. iv. 36); and, "When ye heard the voice out of the midst of
the *ḥoshek*" (darkness) (*ibid*. v. 2); again, "All *ḥoshek* (darkness)
shall be hid in his secret places: a *fire* not blown shall consume him"
(Job XX. 26). The element fire is called *ḥoshek* because it is not
luminous, it is only transparent; for if it were luminous we should see
at night the whole atmosphere in flames. The order of the four elements,
according to the natural position is here described: namely, first
earth, above it water, air close to water, and fire above air; for by
placing

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

air over water, *ḥoshek* (fire), which is "upon the face of the deep,"
is undoubtedly above air. It was here necessary to use the term *ruaḥ
elohim*, because air is described here as in motion (*meraḥefet*), and
the motion of the air is, as a rule, ascribed to God; comp. "And there
went forth a wind from the Lord" (Num. xi. 31); "Thou didst blow with
thy wind" (Exod. xv. 10); "And the Lord turned a mighty strong west
wind" (*ibid*. x. 19), and the like. As the first *ḥoshek*, which
denotes the element fire, is different from the *ḥoshek* mentioned
further on in the sense of "darkness," the latter is explained and
distinguished from the former, according to our explanation, in the
words, "And darkness he called Night." This is now clear.

The phrase, "And he divided between the waters," etc., does not describe
a division in space, as if the one part were merely above the other,
whilst the nature of both remained the same, but a distinction as
regards their nature or form. One portion of that which was first called
water was made one thing by certain properties it received, and another
portion received a different form, and this latter portion is that which
is commonly called water and of this it is said, "And the gathering of
the waters he called Seas." Scripture even indicates that the first
*mayim* ("water") in the phrase, "On the face of the waters," does not
refer to the waters which form the seas and that part of the element
"water," having received a particular form, and being above the air, is
distinguished from the other part which has received the form of
ordinary water. For the words, "And he divided between the waters which
are beneath the firmament and the waters which are above the firmament
are similar in meaning to the phrase, "And God divided between the light
and the darkness," and refer to a distinction by a separate form. The
firmament itself was formed of water; and in the words of our Sages
(*Bereshit Rabba*; cap. iv.), "The middle drop congealed and formed the
heavens."

Here likewise Scripture says, in accordance with what I said above, "And
God called the firmament Heaven" (Gen. i. 8), in order to explain the
homonymity of the term *shamayim* (heaven), and to show that *shamayim*
in the first verse is not the firmament which is also called *shamayim*
(heaven). The difference is more clearly expressed in the words, "In the
open firmament of heaven" (*ibid*. i. 20); here it is shown that
"firmament" (*raki‘a*) and "heaven" (*shamayim*), are two different
things. In consequence of this homonymity of the term *shamayim* the
term *raki‘a* (firmament) is also used of the true heaven, just as the
real firmament is sometimes called *shamayim* (heaven); comp. "And God
set them in the *raki‘a* (firmament) of the heaven" (*ibid*. i. 17).

This verse shows clearly that the stars, the sun, and the moon are not,
as people believe, on the surface of the spheres, but they are fixed in
the spheres, and this has been proved satisfactorily, there being no
vacuum in the Universe: for it is said, "in the firmament of the
heaven," and not "upon the firmament of the heaven."

It is therefore clear that there has been one common element called
water, which has been afterwards distinguished by three different forms;
one part forms the seas, another the firmament, and a third part is over
the firmament, and all this is separate from the earth. The Scriptural
text follows here a

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

peculiar method in order to indicate some extraordinary mysteries. It
has also been declared by our Sages that the portion above the firmament
is only water by name, not in reality, for they say (Babyl. Talmud,
Ḥagigah 14b) "Four entered the paradise," etc. R. Akiba said to them,
"When you come to the stores of pure marble, do not say, Water, water,
for it is written, 'He that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight'"
(Ps. ci. 7). Consider, if you belong to the class of thinking men, how
clearly and distinctly this passage explains the subject for those who
reflect on it! Understand that which has been proved by Aristotle in his
book *On Meteorology*, and note whatever men of science have said on
meteorological matters.

It is necessary to inquire into the reason why the declaration "that it
was good" is not found in the account of the second day of the Creation.
The various Midrashic sayings of our Sages on this point are well known:
the best of them is the explanation that the creation of the water was
not completed on that day. According to my opinion the reason is
likewise clear, and is as follows: When the creation of any part of the
Universe is described that is permanent, regular, and in a settled
order, the phrase "that it is good" is used. But the account of the
firmament, with that which is above it and is called water, is, as you
see, of a very mysterious character. For if taken literally the
firmament would appear at first thought to be merely an imaginary thing,
as there is no other substance but the elements between us and the
lowest of the heavenly spheres, and there is no water above the air; and
if the firmament, with that which is over it, be supposed to be above
the heavens, it would *a fortiori* seem to be unreal and
uncomprehensible. But if the account be understood in a figurative sense
and according to its true meaning, it is still more mysterious, since it
was considered necessary to make this one of the most hidden secrets, in
order to prevent the multitude from knowing it. This being the case, how
could it be said \[of the creation of the second day\] "that it was
good"? This phrase would tell us that it is perfectly clear what share
the thing to which it refers takes in the permanent existence of the
Universe. But what good can people find in a thing whose real nature is
hidden, and whose apparent nature is not real? Why, therefore, should it
be said in reference to it, "that it was good"? I must, however, give
the following additional explanation. Although the result of the second
day's creation forms an important element among the existing things, the
firmament was not its primary object in the organization of the
Universe, and therefore it could not be said "that it was good"; it was
only the means for the uncovering of the earth. Note this. Our Sages
have already explained that the herbs and trees, which God caused to
spring forth from the ground, were caused by God to grow, after He had
sent down rain upon them; and the passage beginning, "And there went up
a mist from the earth" (ii. 6), refers to that which took place before
the creative act, related in the words, "Let the earth bring forth
grass," etc. (i. ii.). Therefore Onkelos translates it: "And there *had*
gone up a mist from the earth?' It is also evident from the text itself,
where it is distinctly said, "And every plant in the field before it was
in the earth," etc. (ii. 5). This question is now explained.

It is well known to every philosopher that the principal causes of
production and destruction, after the influence of the spheres, are
light and darkness,

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

in so far as these are accompanied by heat and cold. For by the motion
of the spheres the elements intermix, and by light and darkness their
constitution changes. The first change consists in the formation of two
kinds of mist; these are the first causes of meteorological phenomena,
such as rain: they also caused the formation of minerals, of plants, of
animals, and at last of man. It is likewise known that darkness is the
natural property of all things on earth; in them light is accidental,
coming from an external cause, and therefore everything remains in a
state of rest in the absence of light. The Scriptural account of the
Creation follows in every respect exactly the same order, without any
deviation.

Note also the saying of our Sages: "When the Universe was created, all
things were created with size, intellect, and beauty fully developed,
i.e., everything was created perfect in magnitude and form, and endowed
with the most suitable properties: the word *ẓibyonam* (their beauty)
used here has the same meaning as *ẓebi*, 'glory'" (Ezek. xx. 6). Note
this likewise, for it includes a principle fully established.

The following point now claims our attention. The account of the six
days of creation contains, in reference to the creation of man, the
statement: "Male and female created he them" (i. 27), and concludes with
the words: "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the
host of them" (ii. 1), and yet the portion which follows describes the
creation of Eve from Adam, the tree of life, and the tree of knowledge,
the history of the serpent and the events connected therewith, and all
this as having taken place after Adam had been placed in the Garden of
Eden. All our Sages agree that this took place on the sixth day, and
that nothing new was created after the close of the six days. None of
the things mentioned above is therefore impossible, because the laws of
Nature were then not yet permanently fixed. There are, however, some
utterances of our Sages on this subject \[which apparently imply a
different view\]. I will gather them from their different sources and
place them before you, and I will refer also to certain things by mere
hints, just as has been done by the Sages. You must know that their
words, which I am about to quote, are most perfect, most accurate, and
clear to those for whom they were said. I will therefore not add long
explanations, lest I make their statements plain, and I might thus
become "a revealer of secrets," but I will give them in a certain order,
accompanied with a few remarks, which will suffice for readers like you.

One of these utterances is this: "Adam and Eve were at first created as
one being, having their backs united: they were then separated, and one
half was removed and brought before Adam as Eve." The term *mi-ẓal‘otav*
(lit. "of his ribs") signifies "of his sides." The meaning of the word
is proved by referring to *ẓel‘a*, "the side" of the tabernacle (Exod.
xxvi. 20), which Onkelos renders *setar* ("side"), and so also
*mi-ẓal‘otav* is rendered by him "*mi-sitrohi*" (of his sides). Note
also how clearly it has been stated that Adam and Eve were two in some
respects, and yet they remained one, according to the words, "Bone of my
bones, and flesh of my flesh" (Gen. ii. 23). The unity of the two is
proved by the fact that both have the same name, for she is called
*ishshah* (woman), because she was taken out of *ish* (man), also by the
words, "And shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh"
(ii. 24). How great is the ignorance of those who do not

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

see that all this necessarily includes some \[other\] idea \[besides the
literal meaning of the words\]. This is now clear.

Another noteworthy Midrashic remark of our Sages is the following: "The
serpent had a rider, the rider was as big as a camel, and it was the
rider that enticed Eve: this rider was Samaël." Samaël is the name
generally applied by our Sages to Satan. Thus they say in several places
that Satan desired to entice Abraham to sin, and to abstain from binding
Isaac, and he desired also to persuade Isaac not to obey his father. At
the same time they also say, in reference to the same subject, viz., the
*Akedah* ("the binding of Isaac"), that *Samaël* came to Abraham and
said to him, "What! hast thou, being an old man, lost thy senses?" etc.
This shows that Samaël and Satan are identical. There is a meaning in
this name \[Samaël\]), as there is also in the name *naḥash*
("serpent"). In describing how the serpent came to entice Eve, our sages
say: "Samaël was riding on it, and God was laughing at both the camel
and its rider." It is especially of importance to notice that the
serpent did not approach or address Adam, but all his attempts were
directed against Eve, and it was through her that the serpent caused
injury and death to Adam. The greatest hatred exists between the serpent
and Eve, and between his seed and her seed; her seed being undoubtedly
also the seed of man. More remarkable still is the way in which the
serpent is joined to Eve, or rather his seed to her seed; the head of
the one touches the heel of the other. Eve defeats the serpent by
crushing its head, whilst the serpent defeats her by wounding her heel.
This is likewise clear.

The following is also a remarkable passage, most absurd in its literal
sense; but as an allegory it contains wonderful wisdom, and fully agrees
with real facts, as will be found by those who understand all the
chapters of this treatise. When the serpent came to Eve he infected her
with poison; the Israelites, who stood at Mount Sinai, removed that
poison; idolaters, who did not stand at Mount Sinai, have not got rid of
it. Note this likewise. Again they said: "The tree of life extends over
an area of five hundred years' journey, and it is from beneath it that
all the waters of the creation sprang forth": and they added the
explanation that this measure referred to the thickness of its body, and
not to the extent of its branches, for they continue thus: "Not the
extent of the branches thereof, but the stem thereof \[*korato*, lit.,
'its beam,' signifying here 'its stem') has a thickness of five hundred
years' journey." This is now sufficiently clear. Again: "God has never
shown the tree of knowledge \[of good and evil\] to man, nor will He
ever show it." This is correct, for it must be so according to the
nature of the Universe. Another noteworthy saying is this: "And the Lord
God took the man, i.e., raised him, and placed him in the Garden of
Eden," i.e., He gave him rest. The words "He took him," "He gave him,
"have no reference to position in space, but they indicate his position
in rank among transient beings, and the prominent character of his
existence. Remarkable and noteworthy is the great wisdom contained in
the names of Adam, Cain, and Abel, and in the fact that it was Cain who
slew Abel in the field, that both of them perished, although the
murderer had some respite, and that the existence of mankind is due to
Seth alone. Comp. "For God has appointed me another seed" (iv. 25). This
has proved true.

It is also necessary to understand and consider the words, "And Adam

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

gave names" (ii. 20); here it is indicated that languages are
conventional, and that they are not natural, as has been assumed by
some. We must also consider the four different terms employed in
expressing the relations of the heavens to God, *bore* (Creator),
*‘oseh* (Maker), *koneh* (Possessor), and *el* (God). Comp. "God
*created* the heaven and the earth" (i. 1); "In the day that God *made*
the earth and the heavens" (ii. 4); "*Possessor* of heaven and earth"
(xiv. 19); "*God* of the Universe" (xxi, 31); "The God of heaven and the
God of the earth" (xxiv. 3). As to the verbs, *konen*, "he established,"
*tafaḥ*, "he spanned, "and *natah*, "he stretched out," occurring in the
following passages, "Which thou hast *established*" (Ps. viii. 4), "My
right hand hath *spanned* the heavens" (Isa. xviii. 13), "Who
*stretchest out* the heavens" (Ps. civ. 2), they are included in the
term *‘asah* ("he made"); the verb *yaẓar*, "he formed," does not occur
in reference to the heavens. According to my opinion the verb *yaẓar*
denotes to make a form, a shape, or any other accident (for form and
shape are likewise accidents). It is therefore said, *yoẓer* or, "Who
formeth the light" (Isa. xiv. 7), light being an accident; *yoẓer
harim*, "That formeth the mountains" (Amos iv, 13), i.e., that gave them
their shape. In the same sense the verb is used in the passage, "And the
Lord God formed (*va-yiẓer*) all the beasts," etc. (Gen. ii, 7). But in
reference to the Universe, viz., the heavens and the earth, which
comprises the totality of the Creation, Scripture employs the verb
*bara*, which we explain as denoting he produced something from nothing;
also *‘asah* ("he made") on account of the general forms or natural
properties of the things which were given to them; *kanah*, "he
possessed," because God rules over them like a master over his servants.
For this reason He is also called, "The Lord of the whole earth" (Jos.
iii. 11-13); *ha-adon*, "the Lord" (Exod. xx., iii. 17). But although
none can be a master unless there exists something that is in his
possession, this attribute cannot be considered to imply the belief in
the eternal existence of a *materia prima*, since the verbs *bara*, "he
created," and *‘asah*, "he made," are also employed in reference to the
heavens. The Creator is called the God of the heavens and the God of the
Universe, on account of the relations between Him and the heavens; He
governs, and they are governed; the word elohim does not signify
"master" in the sense of "owner"; it expresses the relation between His
position in the totality of existing beings, and the position of the
heavens or the Universe; He is God, not they, i.e., not the heavens.
Note this.

This, together with those explanations which we have given, and which we
intend to give, in reference to this subject, may suffice, considering
the object of this treatise and the capacity of the reader.
