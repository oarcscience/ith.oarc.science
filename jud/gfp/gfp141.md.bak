### CHAPTER V

IT is necessary to notice that the plural *marot elohim*, "visions of
God," is here used, and not the singular mareh, "vision," for there were
several things, of different kinds, that were perceived by the prophet.
The following three things were perceived by him: the *Ofannim*, the
*Ḥayyot*, and the man above the *Ḥayyot*. The description of each of
these visions is introduced by the word *va-ereh*, "and I beheld?" For
the account of the *Ḥayyot*, begins, "And I looked (*va-ereh*), and
behold a whirlwind," etc. (Ezek. i. 4). The account of the *Ofannim*
begins: "Now as I beheld (*va-ereh*) the *Ḥayyot*, behold one ofan upon
the earth" (ver. 15). The vision of that which is above the *Ḥayyot* in
order and rank begins: "And I saw (*va-ereh*) as the colour of the
amber, etc., from the appearance of his loins even upward" (ver. 27).
The word *va-ereh*, "and I beheld," only occurs these three times in the
description of the Mercabah. The doctors of the Mishnah have already
explained this fact, and my attention was called to it by their remarks.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For they said that
only the two first visions, namely, that of the *Ḥayyot* and the
*Ofannim*, might be interpreted to others; but of the third vision,
viz., that of the *ḥashmal* and all that is connected with it, only the
heads of the sections may be taught. Rabbi \[Jehudah\], the Holy, is of
opinion that all the three visions are called *ma‘aseh mercabah*, and
nothing but the heads of the sections could be communicated to others.
The exact words of the discussion are as follows:--Where does *maaseh
mercabhah* end? Rabbi says, with the last *va-ereh*; Rabbi Yiẓḥak says
it ends at the word *ḥashmal* (ver. 27). The portion from *va-ereh* to
*ḥashmal* may be fully, taught; of that which follows, only the heads of
the sections; according to some it is the passage from *va-ereh* to
*ḥashmal*, of which the heads of the sections may be taught, but that
which follows may only be studied by those who possess the capacity,
whilst those that cannot study it by themselves must leave it.--It is
clear from the words of our Sages that different visions are described,
as may also be inferred from the repetition of the word *va-ereh*, and
that these visions are different from each other in degree: the last and
highest of them is the vision commencing, "And I saw as the colour of
*ḥashmal*": that is to say, the divided figure of the man, described as
"the appearance of fire, etc., from the appearance of his loins even
upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward," etc. There
is a difference of opinion among our Sages whether it is permitted to
give by way of hints an exposition of any part of this third vision, or
whether it is prohibited even to teach of it the heads of the sections,
so that only the wise can arrive at understanding it by their own
studies. You will also notice a difference of opinion among our Sages in
reference to the two first visions, viz., that of the *Ḥayyot* and that
of the *Ofannim* whether these may be taught explicitly or only by way
of hints, dark sayings, and heads of sections. You must also notice the
order of these three visions. First comes the vision of the *Ḥayyot*,
because they are first in rank and in the causal relation, as it is
said, "For the spirit of the Hayyah was in the *Ofannim*," and also for
other reasons. The vision of the *Ofannim* \[comes next, and\] is
followed by one which is higher than the *Ḥayyot*, as has been shown.
The cause of this arrangement is, that in study the first two must
necessarily precede the third, and in fact they lead to it.
