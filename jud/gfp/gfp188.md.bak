### CHAPTER LII

WE do not sit, move, and occupy ourselves when we are alone and at home,
in the same manner as we do in the presence of a great king; we speak
and open our mouth as we please when we are with the people of our own
household and with our relatives, but not so when we are in a royal
assembly. If we therefore desire to attain human perfection, and to be
truly men of God, we must awake from our sleep, and bear in mind that
the great king that is over us, and is always joined to us, is greater
than any earthly king, greater than David and Solomon. The king that
cleaves to us and embraces us is the Intellect that influences us, and
forms the link between us and God. We perceive God by means of that
light that He sends down unto us, wherefore the Psalmist says, "In Thy
light shall we see light" (Ps. xxxvi. 9): so God looks down upon us
through that same light, and is always with us beholding and watching us
on account of this light." Can any hide himself in secret places that I
shall not see him?" (Jer. xxiii. 24). Note this particularly.

When the perfect bear this in mind, they will be filled with fear of
God, humility, and piety, with true, not apparent, reverence and respect
of God, in such a manner that their conduct, even when alone with their
wives or in the bath, will be as modest as they are in public
intercourse with other people. Thus it is related of our renowned Sages
that even in their sexual intercourse with their wives they behaved with
great modesty. They also said, "Who is modest? He whose conduct in the
dark night is the same as in the day." You know also how much they
warned us not to walk proudly, since "the fulness of the whole earth is
His glory" (Isa. vi. 3). They thought that by these rules the
above-mentioned idea will be firmly established in the hearts of men,
viz., that we are always before God, and it is in the presence of His
glory that we go to and fro. The great men among our Sages would not
uncover their heads because they believed that God's glory was round
them

and over them; for the same reason they spoke little. In our Commentary
on the Sayings of the Fathers (chap. i. 17) we have fully explained how
we have to restrict our speech. Comp. "For God is in heaven and thou
upon earth, therefore let thy words be few" (Eccles. v. i).

What I have here pointed out to you is the object of all our religious
acts. For by \[carrying out\] all the details of the prescribed
practices, and repeating them continually, some few pious men may attain
human perfection. They will be filled with respect and reverence towards
God; and bearing in mind who is with them, they will perform their duty.
God declares in plain words that it is the object of all religious acts
to produce in man fear of God and obedience to His word-the state of
mind which we have demonstrated in this chapter for those who desire to
know the truth, as being our duty to seek. Comp. "If thou wilt not
observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book,
that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, the Lord thy God"
(Deut. xxviii. 58). Consider how clearly it is stated here that the only
object and aim of "all the words of this law" is to \[make man\] fear
"the glorious and fearful name." That this end is attained by certain
acts we learn likewise from the phrase employed in this verse: "If thou
wilt not observe *to do* . . . that thou mayest fear." For this phrase
clearly shows that fear of God is inculcated \[into our hearts\] when we
act in accordance with the positive and the negative precepts. But the
truths which the Law teaches us--the knowledge of God's Existence and
Unity--create in us love of God, as we have shown repeatedly. You know
how frequently the Law exhorts us to love God. Comp. "And thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy might" (Deut. vi. 5). The two objects, love and fear of
God, are acquired by two different means. The love is the result of the
truths taught in the Law, including the true knowledge of the Existence
of God; whilst fear of God is produced by the practices prescribed in
the Law. Note this explanation.
