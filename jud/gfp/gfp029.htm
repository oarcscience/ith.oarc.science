<p>THE term <i>male</i> is a homonym which denotes that one substance enters another, and fills it, as "And she filled (<i>va-temalle</i>) her pitcher" (Gen. xxiv. 16); "An omer-full (<i>melo</i>) for each" (Exod. xvi. 32), and many other instances. Next, it signifies the expiration or completion of a fixed period</p>  
<p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></A></p>  
<p>of time, as "And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled (<i>va-yimle&uuml;</i>)" (Gen. xxv. 24); "And forty days were completed (<i>va-yimle&uuml;</i>) for him" (Gen. 1. 3). It further denotes attainment of the highest degree of excellency, as "Full (<i>male</i>) with the blessing of the Lord" (Deut. xxxiii. 23); "Them hath he filled (<i>mille</i>) with wisdom of heart" (Exod. xxxv. 35) He was filled (<i>va-yimmale</i>) with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning" (1 Kings vii. 14). In this sense it is said "The whole earth is full (<i>melo</i>) of his glory" (Isa. vi. 4), "All the earth gives evidence of his perfection," i.e. leads to a knowledge of it. Thus also" The glory of the Lord filled (<i>male</i>) the tabernacle" (Exod. xl. 34); and, in fact, every application of the word to God must be interpreted in this manner; and not that He has a body occupying space. If, on the other hand, you prefer to think that in this passage by "the glory of the Lord," a certain light created for the purpose is to be understood, that such light is always termed "glory," and that such light "filled the tabernacle," we have no objection.</p>
