### CHAPTER XI

ALL the great evils which men cause to each other because of certain
intentions, desires, opinions, or religious principles, are likewise due
to non-existence, because they originate in ignorance, which is absence
of wisdom. A blind man, for example, who has no guide, stumbles
constantly, because he cannot see, and causes injury and harm to himself
and others. In the same manner various classes of men, each man in
proportion to his ignorance, bring great evils upon themselves and upon
other individual members of the species. If men possessed wisdom, which
stands in the same relation to the form of man as the sight to the eye,
they would not cause any injury to themselves or to others: for the
knowledge of truth removes hatred and quarrels, and prevents mutual
injuries. This state of society is promised to us by the prophet in the
words: "And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb," etc.; "and the cow and
the bear shall feed together," etc.; and "the sucking child shall play
on the hole of the asp," etc. (Isa. xi. 6 *seq*.). The prophet also
points out what will be the cause of this change: for he says that
hatred, quarrel, and fighting will come to an end, because men will then
have a true knowledge of God. "They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my
holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord,
as the waters cover the sea" (*ibid*. ver. 9). Note it.
