### CHAPTER XXXVII

THE Hebrew term *panim* (face) is homonymous: most of its various
meanings have a figurative character. It denotes in the first place the
face of a living being: comp. "And all *faces* are turned into paleness"
(Jer. xxx. 6); "Wherefore are your *faces* so sad (Gen. xl. 7). In this
sense the term occurs frequently.

The next meaning of the word is "anger"; comp. "And her anger (*paneha*)
was gone" (1 Sam. i. 18). Accordingly, the term is frequently used in
reference to God in the sense of anger and wrath; comp. "The anger
(*pene*) of the Lord hath divided them" (Lam. iv. 16); "The anger
(*pene*) of the Lord is against them that do evil" (Ps. xxxiv. 17);
"Mine anger (*panai*) shall go and I will give thee rest" (Exod. xxxiii.
14); "Then will I set mine anger" (*panai*) (Lev. xx. 3); there are many
other instances.

Another meaning of the word is "the presence and existence of a person";

comp. "He died in the presence (*pene*) \[i.e., in the lifetime\] of all
his brethren" (Gen. xxv. 18); "And in the presence (pene) of all the
people I will be glorified" (Lev. x. 3); "He will surely curse thee in
thy very presence" (*paneka*) (Job i. 11). In the same sense the word is
used in the following passage, "And the Lord spake unto Moses face to
face," i.e., both being present, without any intervening medium between
them. Comp. "Come, let us look one another in the face" (2 Kings xiv.
8); and also "The Lord talked with you face to face" (Deut. v. 4);
instead of which we read more plainly in another place, "Ye heard the
voice of the words, but saw no similitude: only ye heard a voice" (*ib*.
iv. 12). The hearing of the voice without seeing any similitude is
termed "face to face." Similarly do the words, "And the Lord spake unto
Moses face to face" correspond to "There he heard the voice of one
speaking unto him" (Num. vii. 89), in the description of God's speaking
to Moses. Thus it will be clear to you that the perception of the Divine
voice without the intervention of an angel is expressed by "face to
face." In the same sense the word *panim* must be understood in "And my
face (*panai*) shall not be seen" (Exod. xxxiii. 23); i.e., my true
existence, as it is, cannot be comprehended.

The word *panim* is also used in Hebrew as an adverb of place, in the
sense of "before," or "between the hands." In this sense it is
frequently employed in reference to God: so also in the passage, "And my
face (*panai*) shall not be seen," according to Onkelos, who renders it,
"And those before me shall not be seen." He finds here an allusion to
the fact, that there are also higher created beings of such superiority
that their true nature cannot be perceived by man: viz., the ideals,
separate intellects, which in their relation to God are described as
being constantly before Him, or between His hands, i.e., as enjoying
uninterruptedly the closest attention of Divine Providence. He, i.e.,
Onkelos, considers that the things which are described as completely
perceptible are those beings which, as regards existence, are inferior
to the ideals, viz., substance and form: in reference to which we are
told, "And thou shalt see that which is behind me" (*ibid*.), i.e.,
beings, from which, as it were, I turn away, and which I leave behind
me. This figure is to represent the utter remoteness of such beings from
the Deity. You shall later on (chap. liv.) hear my explanation of what
Moses, our teacher, asked for.

The word is also used as an adverb of time, meaning "before." Comp. In
former time (*le-phanim*) in Israel" (Ruth iv. 7); "Of old (*le-phanim*)
hast Thou laid the foundation of the earth" (Ps. Cii. 25).

Another signification of the word is "attention and regard." Comp. "Thou
shalt not have regard (*pene*) to the poor (Lev. xx. 15); "And a person
receiving attention (*panim*)" (Isa. iii. 3); Who does not show regard
(*panim*)," etc. (Deut. x. 17, etc.). The word *panim* (face) has a
similar signification in the blessing, "The Lord turn his face to thee"
(i.e., The Lord let his providence accompany thee), "and give thee
peace."
