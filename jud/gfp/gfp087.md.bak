### INTRODUCTION

TWENTY-FIVE of the propositions which are employed in the proof for the
existence of God, or in the arguments demonstrating that God is neither
corporeal nor a force connected with a material being, or that He is
One, have been fully established, and their correctness is beyond doubt.
Aristotle and the Peripatetics who followed him have proved each of
these propositions. There is, however, one proposition which we do not
accept--namely, the proposition which affirms the Eternity of the
Universe, but we will admit it for the present, because by doing so we
shall be enabled clearly to demonstrate our own theory.

PROPOSITION I.

The existence of an infinite magnitude is impossible.

PROPOSITION II.

The co-existence of an infinite number of finite magnitudes is
impossible.

PROPOSITION III.

The existence of an infinite number of causes and effects is impossible,
even if these were not magnitudes: if, e.g., one Intelligence were the
cause of a second, the second the cause of a third, the third the cause
of a fourth, and so on, the series could not be continued *ad
infinitum*.

PROPOSITION IV.

Four categories are subject to change:

(*a*.) *Substance*.--Changes which affect the substance of a thing are
called genesis and destruction.

(*b*.) *Quantity*.--Changes in reference to quantity are increase and
decrease.

(*c*.) *Quality*.--Changes in the qualities of things are
transformations.

(*d*.) *Place*.--Change of place is called motion.

The term "motion" is properly applied to change of place, but is also
used in a general sense of all kinds of changes.

PROPOSITION V.

Motion implies change and transition from potentiality to actuality.

PROPOSITION VI.

The motion of a thing is either essential or accidental; or it is due to
an external force, or to the participation of the thing in the motion of
another thing. This latter kind of motion is similar to the accidental
one. An instance of essential motion may be found in the translation of
a thing from one place to another. The accident of a thing, as, e.g.,
its black colour, is said to move when the thing itself changes its
place. The upward motion of a stone, owing to a force applied to it in
that direction, is an instance of a motion due to an external force. The
motion of a nail in a boat may serve to illustrate motion due to the
participation of a thing in the motion of another thing; for when the
boat moves, the nail is said to move likewise. The same is the case with
everything composed of several parts: when the thing itself moves, every
part of it is likewise said to move.

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

PROPOSITION VII.

Things which are changeable are, at the same time, divisible. Hence
everything that moves is divisible, and consequently corporeal; but that
which is indivisible cannot move, and cannot therefore be corporeal.

PROPOSITION VIII.

A thing that moves accidentally must come to rest, because it does not
move of its own accord: hence accidental motion cannot continue for
ever.

PROPOSITION IX.

A corporeal thing that sets another corporeal thing in motion can only
effect this by setting itself in motion at the time it causes the other
thing to move.

PROPOSITION X.

A thing which is said to be contained in a corporeal object must satisfy
either of the two following conditions: it either exists through that
object, as is the case with accidents, or it is the cause of the
existence of that object; such is, e.g., its essential property. In both
cases it is a force existing in a corporeal object.

PROPOSITION XI.

Among the things which exist through a material object, there are some
which participate in the division of that object, and are therefore
accidentally divisible, as, e.g., its colour, and all other qualities
that spread throughout its parts. On the other hand, among the things
which form the essential elements of an object, there are some which
cannot be divided in any way, as, e.g., the soul and the intellect.

PROPOSITION XII.

A force which occupies all parts of a corporeal object is finite, that
object itself being finite.

PROPOSITION XIII.

None of the several kinds of change can be continuous, except motion
from place to place, provided it be circular.

PROPOSITION XIV.

Locomotion is in the natural order of the several kinds of motion the
first and foremost. For genesis and corruption are preceded by
transformation, which, in its turn, is preceded by the approach of the
transforming agent to the object which is to be transformed. Also,
increase and decrease are impossible without previous genesis and
corruption.

PROPOSITION XV.

Time is an accident that is related and joined to motion in such a
manner that the one is never found without the other. Motion is only
possible in time, and the idea of time cannot be conceived otherwise
than in connexion with motion; things which do not move have no relation
to time.

PROPOSITION XVI.

Incorporeal bodies can only be numbered when they are forces situated in
a body; the several forces must then be counted together with substances

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

or objects in which they exist. Hence purely spiritual beings, which are
neither corporeal nor forces situated in corporeal objects, cannot be
counted, except when considered as causes and effects.

PROPOSITION XVII.

When an object moves, there must be some agent that moves it, from
without, as, e.g., in the case of a stone set in motion by the hand: or
from within, e.g., when the body of a living being moves. Living beings
include in themselves, at the same time, the moving agent and the thing
moved: when, therefore, a living being dies, and the moving agent, the
soul, has left the body, i.e., the thing moved, the body remains for
some time in the same condition as before, and yet cannot move in the
manner it has moved previously. The moving agent, when included in the
thing moved, is hidden from, and imperceptible to, the senses. This
circumstance gave rise to the belief that the body of an animal moves
without the aid of a moving agent. When we therefore affirm, concerning
a thing in motion, that it is its own moving agent, or, as is generally
said, that it moves of its own accord, we mean to say that the force
which really sets the body in motion exists in that body itself.

PROPOSITION XVIII.

Everything that passes over from a state of potentiality to that of
actuality, is caused to do so by some external agent: because if that
agent existed in the thing itself, and no obstacle prevented the
transition, the thing would never be in a state of potentiality, but
always in that of actuality. If, on the other hand, while the thing
itself contained that agent, some obstacle existed, and at a certain
time that obstacle was removed, the same cause which removed the
obstacle would undoubtedly be described as the cause of the transition
from potentiality to actuality, \[and not the force situated within the
body\]. Note this.

PROPOSITION XIX.

A thing which owes its existence to certain causes has in itself merely
the possibility of existence: for only if these causes exist, the thing
likewise exists. It does not exist if the causes do not exist at all, or
if they have ceased to exist, or if there has been a change in the
relation which implies the existence of that thing as a necessary
consequence of those causes.

PROPOSITION XX.

A thing which has in itself the necessity of existence cannot have for
its existence any cause whatever.

PROPOSITION XXI.

A thing composed of two elements has necessarily their composition as
the cause of its present existence. Its existence is therefore not
necessitated by its own essence; it depends on the existence of its two
component parts and their combination.

PROPOSITION XXII.

Material objects are always composed of two elements \[at least\], and
are without exception subject to accidents. The two component elements
of all bodies are substance and form. The accidents attributed to
material objects are quantity, geometrical form, and position.

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

PROPOSITION XXIII.

Everything that exists potentially and whose essence includes a certain
state of possibility, may at some time be without actual existence.

PROPOSITION XXIV.

That which is potentially a certain thing is necessarily material, for
the state of possibility is always connected with matter.

PROPOSITION XXV.

Each compound substance consists of matter and form, and requires an
agent for its existence, viz., a force which sets the substance in
motion, and thereby enables it to receive a certain form. The force
which thus prepares the substance of a certain individual being, is
called the immediate motor.

Here the necessity arises of investigating into the properties of
motion, the moving agent and the thing moved. But this has already been
explained sufficiently; and the opinion of Aristotle may be expressed in
the following proposition: Matter does not move of its own accord--an
important proposition that led to the investigation of the Prime Motor
(the first moving agent).

Of these foregoing twenty-five propositions some may be verified by
means of a little reflection and the application of a few propositions
capable of proof, or of axioms or theorems of almost the same force,
such as have been explained by me. Others require many arguments and
propositions, all of which, however, have been established by conclusive
proofs partly in the Physics and its commentaries, and partly in the
Metaphysics and its commentary. I have already stated that in this work
it is not my intention to copy the books of the philosophers or to
explain difficult problems, but simply to mention those propositions
which are closely connected with our subject, and which we want for our
purpose.

To the above propositions one must be added which enunciates that the
universe is eternal, and which is held by Aristotle to be true, and even
more acceptable than any other theory. For the present we admit it, as a
hypothesis, only for the purpose of demonstrating our theory. It is the
following proposition:

PROPOSITION XXVI

Time and motion are eternal, constant, and in actual existence.

In accordance with this proposition, Aristotle is compelled to assume
that there exists actually a body with constant motion, viz., the fifth
element. He therefore says that the heavens are not subject to genesis
or destruction, because motion cannot be generated nor destroyed. He
also holds that every motion must necessarily be preceded by another
motion, either of the same or of a different kind. The belief that the
locomotion of an animal is not preceded by another motion, is not true:
for the animal is caused to move, after it had been in rest, by the
intention to obtain those very things which bring about that locomotion.
A change in its state of health, or some image, or some new idea can
produce a desire to seek that which is conducive to its welfare and to
avoid that which is contrary. Each of these three causes

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

sets the living being in motion, and each of them is produced by various
kinds of motion. Aristotle likewise asserts that everything which is
created must, before its actual creation, have existed *in potentiâ*. By
inferences drawn from this assertion he seeks to establish his
proposition, viz., The thing that moves is finite, and its path finite;
but it repeats the motion in its path an infinite number of times. This
can only take place when the motion is circular, as has been stated in
Proposition XIII. Hence follows also the existence of an infinite number
of things which do not co-exist but follow one after the other.

Aristotle frequently attempts to establish this proposition; but I
believe that he did not consider his proofs to be conclusive. It
appeared to him to be the most probable and acceptable proposition. His
followers, however, and the commentators of his books, contend that it
contains not only a probable but a demonstrative proof, and that it has,
in fact, been fully established. On the other hand, the Mutakallemim try
to prove that the proposition cannot be true, as, according to their
opinion, it is impossible to conceive how an infinite number of things
could even come into existence successively. They assume this
impossibility as an axiom. I, however, think that this proposition is
admissible, but neither demonstrative, as the commentators of Aristotle
assert, nor, on the other hand, impossible, as the Mutakallemim say. We
have no intention to explain here the proofs given by Aristotle, or to
show our doubts concerning them, or to set forth our opinions on the
creation of the universe. I here simply desire to mention those
propositions which we shall require for the proof of the three
principles stated above. Having thus quoted and admitted these
propositions, I will now proceed to explain what may be inferred from
them.
