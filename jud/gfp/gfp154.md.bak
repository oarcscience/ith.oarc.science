### CHAPTER XVIII

HAVING shown in the preceding chapter that of all living beings mankind
alone is directly under the control of Divine Providence, I will now add
the following remarks: It is an established fact that species have no
existence except in our own minds. Species and other classes are merely
ideas formed in our minds, whilst everything in real existence is an
individual object, or an aggregate of individual objects. This being
granted, it must further be admitted that the result of the existing
Divine influence, that reaches mankind through the human intellect, is
identical with individual intellects really in existence, with which,
e.g., Zeiḍ, Amr, Kaled and Bekr, are endowed. Hence it follows, in
accordance with what I have mentioned in the preceding chapter, that the
greater the share is which a person has obtained of this Divine
influence, on account of both his physical predisposition and his
training, the greater must also be the effect of Divine Providence upon
him, for the action of Divine Providence is proportional to the
endowment of intellect, as has been mentioned above. The relation of
Divine Providence is therefore not the same to all men; the greater the
human perfection a person has attained, the greater the benefit he
derives from Divine Providence. This benefit is very great in the case
of prophets, and varies according to the degree of their prophetic
faculty: as it varies in the case of pious and good men according to
their piety and uprightness. For it is the intensity of the Divine
intellectual influence that has inspired the prophets, guided the good
in their actions, and perfected the wisdom of the pious. In the same
proportion as ignorant and disobedient persons are deficient in that
Divine influence, their condition is inferior, and their rank equal to
that of irrational beings: and they are "like unto the beasts" (Ps.
xlix. 21). For this reason it was not only considered a light thing to
slay them, but it was even directly commanded for the benefit of
mankind. This belief that God provides for every individual human being
in accordance with his merits is one of the fundamental principles on
which the Law is founded.

Consider how the action of Divine Providence is described in reference
to every incident in the lives of the patriarchs, to their occupations,
and even to their passions, and how God promised to direct His attention
to them. Thus God said to Abraham, "I am thy shield" (Gen. xv. 1); to
Isaac, "I will be with thee, and I will bless thee" (*ibid*. xxvi. 3);
to Jacob, "I am with thee, and will keep thee" (*ibid*. xxviii. 15); to
\[Moses\] the chief of the Prophets, "Certainly I will be with thee, and
this shall be a token unto thee" (Exod. iii. 12); to Joshua, "As I was
with Moses, so I shall be with thee" (Josh. i. 5). It is clear that in
all these cases the action of Providence has been proportional to man's
perfection. The following verse describes how Providence protects good
and pious men, and abandons fools; "He Will keep the feet of his saints,
and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man
prevail" (1 Sam. ii. 9). When we see that some men escape plagues and
mishaps, whilst others perish by them, we must not attribute this to a
difference in the properties of their bodies, or in their physical
constitution, "for by strength shall no man prevail"; but it must be
attributed to their different degrees of perfection, some approaching
God, whilst others moving away from Him. Those who approach Him are best
protected,

and "He will keep the feet of his saints"; but those who keep far away
from Him are left exposed to what may befall them; there is nothing that
could protect them from what might happen; they are like those who walk
in darkness, and are certain to stumble. The protection of the pious by
Providence is also expressed in the following passages:--"He keepeth all
his bones," etc. (Ps. xxxiv. 21); "The eyes of the Lord are upon the
righteous" (*ibid*. ver. 16); "He shall call upon me and I shall answer
him" (*ibid*. ver. 15). There are in Scripture many more passages
expressing the principle that men enjoy Divine protection in proportion
to their perfection and piety. The philosophers have likewise discussed
this subject. Abu-nasr, in the Introduction to his *Commentary on
Aristotle's Nikomachean Ethics*, says as follows:--Those who possess the
faculty of raising their souls from virtue to virtue obtain, according
to Plato, Divine protection to a higher degree.

Now consider how by this method of reasoning we have arrived at the
truth taught by the Prophets, that every person has his individual share
of Divine Providence in proportion to his perfection. For philosophical
research leads to this conclusion, if we assume, as has been mentioned
above, that Divine Providence is in each case proportional to the
person's intellectual development. It is wrong to say that Divine
Providence extends only to the species, and not to individual beings, as
some of the philosophers teach. For only individual beings have real
existence, and individual beings are endowed with Divine Intellect;
Divine Providence acts, therefore, upon these individual beings.

Study this chapter as it ought to be studied; you will find in it all
the fundamental principles of the Law; you will see that these are in
conformity with philosophical speculation, and all difficulties will be
removed; you will have a clear idea of Divine Providence.

After having described the various philosophical opinions on Providence,
and on the manner how God governs the Universe, I will briefly state the
opinion of our co-religionists on the Omniscience of God, and what I
have to remark on this subject
