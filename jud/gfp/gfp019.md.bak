### CHAPTER IX

THE original meaning of the word *kisse*, "throne," requires no comment.
Since men of greatness and authority, as, e.g., kings, use the throne as
a seat, and "the throne" thus indicates the rank, dignity, and position
of the person for whom it is made, the Sanctuary has been styled "the
throne," inasmuch as it likewise indicates the superiority of Him who
manifests Himself, and causes His light and glory to dwell therein.
Comp. "A glorious throne on high from the beginning is the place of our
sanctuary" (Jer. xvii. 12). For the same reason the heavens are called
"throne," for to the mind of him who observes them with intelligence
they suggest the Omnipotence of the Being which has called them into
existence, regulates their motions, and governs the sublunary world by
their beneficial influence: as we read, "Thus saith the Lord, The
heavens are my throne and the earth my footstool" (Isa. lxvi. 1); i.e.,
they testify to my Existence, my Essence, and my Omnipotence, as the
throne testifies to the greatness of him who is worthy to occupy it.

This is the idea which true believers should entertain; not, however,
that the Omnipotent, Supreme God is supported by any material object;
for God is incorporeal, as we shall prove further on; how, then, can He
be said to occupy any space, or rest on a body? The fact which I wish to
point out is this: every place distinguished by the Almighty, and chosen
to receive His light and splendour, as, for instance, the Sanctuary or
the Heavens, is termed "throne"; and, taken in a wider sense, as in the
passage "For my hand is upon the throne of God" (Exod. xvii. 16), "the
throne" denotes

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

here the Essence and Greatness of God. These, however (the Essence and
Greatness of God) need not be considered as something separate from the
God Himself or as part of the Creation, so that God would appear to have
existed both without the throne, and with the throne: such a belief
would be undoubtedly heretical. It is distinctly stated, "Thou, O Lord,
remainest for ever; Thy throne from generation to generation" (Lam. v.
19). By "Thy throne" we must, therefore, understand something
inseparable from God. On that account, both here and in all similar
passages. the word "throne" denotes God's Greatness and Essence, which
are inseparable from His Being.

Our opinion will be further elucidated in the course of this Treatise.
