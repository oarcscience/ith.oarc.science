# CHAPTER IV.

CONCERNING OBJECTS USED FOR IDOLS.--THE MANNER IN WHICH AN IDOL IS
PROFANED SO AS TO BE ALLOWED FOR USE.--THE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE
ELDERS OF ROME ON THE ONE HAND AND R. LAMALIEL, THE PRINCE, ON THE
OTHER.--HOW TO PREPARE WINE IN THE POSSESSION OF A HEATHEN FOR
ISRAELITES.

MISHNA *I*.: R. Ismael says: Three stones near one another and beside
the Merkules are prohibited; two stones in this position are allowed.
The sages;, however, said: Only the stones that are close by it are
prohibited, but those that do not appear to be so are allowed.

GEMARA: The opinion of the sages is easily explained, as they hold that
the heathens worship also the fragments of their idols, accordingly they
prohibit only the stones that are perceptibly near the idol. But R.
Ismael's opinion presents some difficulty--viz: If he upholds the view
that pieces are also worshipped, he should forbid also two stones; on
the other hand, if he believes that the heathens do not worship broken
idols, he should consistently allow also three stones near the Merkules!
Said R. Itz'hak b. Joseph in the name of R. Johanan: The limit of
proximity required in the Mishna is set down at four ells; now, R.
Ismael believes that the heathen might make of the three stones a small
Merkules beside the big one, but not of two stones; while the sages who
do not entertain this belief merely regard these stones as fragments of
the Merkules, hence they forbid only those that are visibly belonging to
it irrespective of their number.

It once happened that the palace of King Janai was destroyed; thereupon
came heathens and erected therein a Merkules; later on others came who
did not worship the Merkules, took the stones and paved a street
therewith. Some of the sages abstained then from treading upon these
stones, while others were passing there; hereupon said R. Johanan: The
son of the saints treads on them, should we abstain therefrom?

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Who was this son?
R. Menahem b. Simai, so called because he would refrain from even
looking upon the face of a coin. But why, this notwithstanding, were
some shunning that street? Because they guided themselves by the opinion
of R. Gidel, who said in the name of R. 'Hyya b. Joseph, quoting Rabh:
Though the idol is capable of being profaned, yet the idol-sacrifice is
not, and this admits of proof from here: "They clung to the Baal Peor
and ate sacrifices of the dead idols," where a comparison is drawn
between an idol-sacrifice and a corpse, to indicate that just as the
latter remains but a corpse, so does the sacrifice remain unalterably an
idol-sacrifice. In accordance with this, those sages who regarded these
stones as idol-sacrifices, refrained from treading thereon, while the
others held that stones cannot be regarded as sacrifices, since only
those objects are regarded as sacrifices that were actually offered in
the temple, which has never been the case with stones.

R. Joseph b. Aba narrated: Once Rabba b. Jeremiah, when visiting us
propounded the following Boraitha: If a heathen takes stones from a
Merkules and paves therewith the street, the Israelites are allowed to
walk thereon; if, however, an Israelite did it, they are prohibited
therefrom. And there is no artisan that could set right this Boraitha.
(The difficulty is explained further on.) Said R. Sheshith: I, though
not an artisan, will nevertheless attempt to explain it: The intricacy
here implied is what R. Gidel said concerning the incapacity of an
idol-sacrifice to be profaned, and is removed by reminding what has been
shown above--viz: that these stones cannot be considered sacrifices.

R. Na'hman says in the name of Rabba b. Abuhu, quoting Rabh: If the
worship of an idol consists in the rapping before it with a cane, and
one breaks a cane before the idol in its honor, he is liable;
furthermore, if it was yet a new idol never before worshipped, this act
is considered a worship and renders the idol forbidden as well as the
broken stick which is regarded a sacrifice. If, however, one threw a
stick before an idol the worship of which consists in the throwing of
sticks, the stick is not forbidden, but the thrower is liable. Thereupon
said Rabha to R. Na'hman: The stick broken before the idol resembles the
slaughtering in the temple, and is therefore forbidden; why, then,
should not the cane thrown before the idol resemble the blood sprinkling
in the temple, and be also forbidden? And he answered: Nay; the blood
separates into drops through the

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

sprinkling, while the stick, even when thrown, remains whole. If such be
the case, why should, then, rejoined Rabha, stones be prohibited when
thrown before the Merkules? Answered R. Na'hman: I myself, knowing no
answer to this, inquired of Rabba b. Abuhu, who, likewise ignorant of
it, asked R. 'Hyya b. Rabh, who addressed this question to his father,
Rabh, and he said: These stones are forbidden because when thrown before
the Merkules they enlarge it, thereby themselves becoming idols. Said
Rabha: This explanation is plausible if we admit that the idol is
prohibited immediately upon its completion, *i.e.*, before it was
worshipped; but, as we know, there is yet the other opinion prohibiting
it only after it was worshipped. How, then, according to this latter
view, can the stone be forbidden? Said R. Na'hman: A stone thrown to
Markules is, while being thrown, considered a sacrifice, and, upon
falling in heap with the other stones, an idol; wherefor it renders
prohibited also the stones lying there from before, for they were
worshipped by its being thrown, and the stone itself is forbidden as
soon as another was cast upon it in token of honor and worship. Rejoined
Rabha: According to this explanation, the last stone would be allowed,
inasmuch as it has not yet been worshipped. Said R. Na'hman: When you
are only able to recognize the last one, go freely and take it. R. Asha,
however, explained the matter thus: Each stone, by the fact of being
thrown, is (as it is not worshipped otherwise) itself a sacrifice, and
in the same time an idol for the other stone following; hence these
stones are all forbidden.

R. Abuhu said in the name of R. Johanan: That one is not liable for
slaughtering a blemished animal to an idol is deduced hence \[Exod. xx.
20\]: "Whoever offers to the gods beside the Lord be excommunicated,"
whence it follows that liability attaches only to such objects as are
fit to be sacrificed to the Lord. Said Rabha: What kind of blemish has
R. Abuhu in view? Hardly that of the eyebrows, since an animal with such
a defect was accepted by the descendants of Noah for a sacrifice in the
temple of the Lord; hence he has in view such animals that lack a limb,
and agrees in this respect with R. Eliezar, who said: Whence do we know
that the desendants of Noah are prohibited from offering an animal that
lacks one of its limbs? From \[Gen. vi. 19\]: "And of every living
thing, of all flesh, too," etc. Living thing means such living being
that wants none of its limbs, for from such animals sacrifices shall be
offered in

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

times to come. Thereto was objected: The expression "living" means to
exclude but such animals that have a defect wherewith they cannot
survive a full year. (Rejoined R. Eliezar): Such have already been
excluded implicitly by the expression \[ibid. vii. 3\]: "To keep seed
alive upon the face of all the earth," since they can neither bear nor
produce offspring. But, was retorted, how is it according to those who
do not share this opinion as to the reproductive incapacity? To them the
word, *ihtoch*, with thee, sufficiently indicates that Noah was ordered
to take only animals resembling him in organization, and, *i.e.*,
without defects. And for aught we know, Noah may have been himself
defective? By no means; the Scripture calls him *tamim*, perfect; and
that this attribute does not refer to his conduct is shown by the fact
that he is called also *zadik*, upright. But maybe that he was perfect
in conduct and upright in his dealings? Nay; this is no convincing
argument that Noah may have been defective, for, had he been such, he,
following the order, would have surely taken in only animals resembling
him. But now that you make use of the *ihtoch* to prove that Noah's
animals were of necessity normal, what is the other phrase, To keep
seed, etc., good for? This was meant to remind Noah that the animals are
not for keeping him company, but for reproducing their species; hence he
must not take in old or castrated ones.

R. Elazar said: If one slaughter an animal to Markules, he is liable,
notwithstanding that Markules is worshipped by stone-throwing; for it
reads \[Lev. xvii. 7\]: "They shall offer no more their sacrifices unto
evil spirits, after which they have gone astray," hence no blood
sacrifices even to such "evil spirits" that are worshipped otherwise; as
the usual worship is prohibited already in \[Deut. xii. 30\], "How did
these nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise."

MISHNA *II*.: Money, garments, utensils found on the head of an idol are
allowed; vine with grapes on, wreaths of corn ears, wine, oil, fine
flour, and whatever is offered upon the altar, is prohibited.

GEMARA: Whence is this deduced? said R. Hyya b. Joseph in the name of R.
Oshia: from \[Deut. xxix. 16\]: "And you saw their abominations, and
their idols of wood and stone, silver and gold which they had with
them"; and again \[ibid. vii. 2 5\]: "Thou shalt not covet the silver or
gold that is on them." From the two wordings, "with them" and "on them"
we conclude

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

that whatever is found with or on the idol without being an ornament
thereof is allowed, but is not, if an ornament. But why not draw the
conclusion that, just as all that is with the idol is forbidden, so also
is all that is on it, regardless of its being an ornament or not? If
such be the case, the "on them" would be superfluous. But why does the
Mishna allow money which is then, doubtless, for decorating purposes?
Said the disciples of R. Janai: It is allowed only when it is hung in a
sack round the neck of the idol, which makes the latter look like a
carrier, and this is surely no ornament; furthermore, as to garments,
they are allowed only when they lie folded on the head of the idol,
which makes it look like a washwoman. Regarding utensils, R. Papa said:
It means here that they lie on the head so as to disfigure the idol. R.
Assi b. Hyya said: All objects within the curtain of the idol are
prohibited, even water and salt; while outside the curtain only
decorating objects are forbidden.

MISHNA *III*.: The use of a garden or bathing-place belonging to an idol
is allowed when it is gratis, but is forbidden when it is for
remuneration. If they belong to both the idol and some people, their use
is allowed unconditionally, whether gratis or for pay. The idol of a
heathen is forbidden from the very beginning, while that of an Israelite
is not forbidden until after it has been actually worshipped.

GEMARA: "*Their use is allowed unconditionally*," etc. Said Abayi: "For
pay" means that the idol-worshipper and not the priest is remunerated,
while "gratis" means that neither is getting anything.

"*The idol of a heathen is forbidden from the very beginning*," etc. The
Mishna expresses here the opinion of R. Aqiba without, however,
mentioning his name. For we have learned, it reads \[Deut. xii. 2\]: "Ye
shall utterly destroy all the places whereon the nations you are about
to drive out," etc.; this verse has reference to all the utensils
employed by the heathens in their worship. If this be so, one could
conclude that even such vessels are forbidden that were begun for
idol-worship, but are not yet finished, or such that though finished,
have not as yet been brought into the temple of the idol; wherefore it
says in the quoted verse "in their worship," whence it follows that only
what was employed at the worship is forbidden. It is in view of this
that the sages prohibit the idol of a heathen not until after it was
worshipped, and that of an Israelite from the

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

very beginning. So said R. Ismael; R. Aqiba, however, said the very
contrary of what the sages maintain--viz: an idol of a heathen is
prohibited as soon as prepared, while that of an Israelite only when
already worshipped.

The master said: The verse \[Deut. xii. 2\] has reference only to
utensils employed by the heathens in their worship. But does the verse
speak of utensils when it speaks of places? The answer is this: The
verse in question cannot possibly refer to the places, as it is stated
right after: "To their gods on the mountains," whence it was concluded
that the gods but not the mountains are forbidden; consequently, neither
can here be meant the places, hence it is the *objects* in the places
that are meant, and such objects can be no other than the utensils in
question. But further above it is said: The sages prohibit the idol of a
heathen not until after it was worshipped. How could the sages commit
themselves to such an inference from a verse where the vessels, and not
at all the idol, are concerned? The answer is that the verse says, "All
places where the nations worshipped their gods." Now, as previously
explained, "the places" mean the vessels on them, hence, just as the
vessels are not prohibited until after they were employed in idol
worship, so also the idols are forbidden only after they were
worshipped. On the other hand, R. Aqiba, who does not compare the
vessels to the idols, may say that the particle *eth* divides the verse
into two distinct parts. As to R. Ismael, he explains his position thus:
As the idol of a heathen is forbidden only after its being worshipped,
it is common sense that that of an Israelite should be forbidden from
the very beginning; otherwise what difference would there be between the
two? Surely not that the idol of an Israelite be altogether allowed, as
it reads \[Deut. xxvii. 15\]: "Cursed be the man who maketh a carved or
molten image," etc.; hence the curse is imposed upon the making of an
idol. Well and good, but this verse does not prove as yet that the use
of the idol is forbidden! It was answered that it is further expressly
stated: "The idol is detestable to the Lord," hence, prohibited. Now,
how does R. Aqiba assert his position? Said Ula, from \[ibid. Vii. 25\]:
"The graven images of their gods ye shall burn with fire," etc., which
"images" surely means the likeness of the idol as soon as it is graved.
As to R. Ismael, he understands this verse in the sense given to it by
R. Joseph, who said: Whence do we know that a heathen may profane his
idol? From "The images of their gods," etc.,

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

which means that the idol is prohibited so long as the heathen treats it
as a god, but becomes allowed as soon as he no longer treats it so,
*i.e.*, breaks up some piece thereof. On the other hand, R. Aqiba proves
that the heathen can profane the idol from the same source used by
Samuel--viz. \[ibid.\]: "Thou shalt not covet the silver or gold that is
on them," and ends, "Thou shouldst take it unto thyself"; this apparent
contradiction he explains thus: Do not covet before the idol is
profaned, but after its profanation you may take it. But again, whence
does R. Aqiba know that the idol of an Israelite is not prohibited until
after worship? Said R. Jehudah, it reads \[ibid. xxvii. 15\]: "Cursed be
it, and putteth it in a secret place." This phrase, "in secret place,"
means, pours out before the idol his secret thoughts; hence, R. Aqiba
concludes that it is forbidden only after such worship. R. Ismael, on
the other hand, explains this phrase in the sense of R. Iz'hak, who
says: This phrase teaches us that the idol of an Israelite must be
wholly destroyed and put in a [secret](errata.htm#59.md) place; while R.
Aqiba endeavors to prove this obligation by what R. 'Hisda said in the
name of Rabh \[Deut. xvi. 21\]: "Thou shalt not plant unto thyself a
grove, any tree near the altar of thy Lord," signifies that just as an
altar that becomes out of use must be removed out of sight by being
buried under ground, so also the groves (that are spoken of here in
connection with the altar) must be put in secrecy. R. Ismael, however,
infers from this verse what is said by Resh Lakish (Sanhedrin, p. 15,
par. Resh Lakish, to the end).

R. Hamnuna questioned: What is the law concerning a vessel that, after a
piece had been broken off it, was again made fit for use and then
dedicated to idol-worship? Before proceeding to answer this question,
one must know to whose idol this vessel was devoted; if to that of a.
heathen, both R. Ismael and R. Aqiba consider such vessels as serving
vessels, which are forbidden not until after they have actually been
used in the worship. Thus, the question must refer to the idol of an
Israelite, and, since R. Aqiba, who prohibits the idol of an Israelite
only after worship, will doubtless do the same as regards the serving
vessel in question, it can be treated only in the light of R. Ismael's
opinion, so that it is necessary to know in the first place whether such
serving vessels are subject to the same rules as the vessels of a
heathen's idol are. If yes, they are forbidden after the use; but if
they follow the rules of an Israelite's idol, they are forbidden from
the very beginning. But why does

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> R. Hamnuna ask
concerning a repaired and not a newly-made vessel? The answer is that
his question has, in fact, reference to the problem of old defilement.
As the following Mishna (Kelim, xi. 1): "Of metallic vessels the flat
and hollowed ones are subject to defilement; if, however, they were
defiled and broke they become clean. But if they were again made into
vessels, the old defilement returns." Now, R. Hamnuna was in doubt as to
whether this Mishna is concerned with biblical defilements only, or also
with rabbinical defilements. But if so, why does not R. Hamnuna put his
question regarding rabbinical defilements in general? His desire was
that his question, embrace also the other point--viz: Does a rabbinical
defilement return? And should you decide that it does not, then the
question arises: How is the case with idolatry? Shall we assume that,
because of the rigorousness of idolatry, a rabbinical be equivalent to a
biblical or not? This question remains undecided.

R. Johanan asked R. Janai: I should like to know whether or no food
offered to an idol, if profaned, loses thereby its defilement (which lay
therein by reason of its being of the idol)? But why does he ask about
food and not about vessels? Because he knew that the remedy for devoted
vessels is a legal bath, which abolishes also the defilement.
Furthermore, R. Johanan does not ask whether or no an idolized food, if
worshipped and then profaned, still defiles; because he knows that a
profaned idol is no longer forbidden, hence, its defilement is also
abolished. But he put up the foregoing question merely because R. Gidel
said somewhere above that all objects sacrificed to idols can never be
profaned, so he wants to know now whether R. Gidel's theory applies to
the prohibition which is biblical, but not to the defilement which is
rabbinical, or to both? Also this question remains undecided.

R. Jose b. Saul asked Rabbi whether the vessels used (in the temple of
Egypt) in the house of Chania, are allowed for use also in the temple of
Jerusalem? This question suggests that R. Jose shared the opinion of
those who say: The temple of Egypt was not considered an idol temple. It
was, however, taught that the priests who served in the Chania temple
are not allowed to serve in that of Jerusalem, the less so are those who
served at idol-worships. He thus wanted to know whether the vessels
follow the same rules as the priests; or since the priests are endowed
with intelligence they were fined. But the vessels

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

destitute of intelligence should not be fined, or there is no
difference? Hereupon said Rabbi: Yea; they are prohibited and there is a
verse from Scripture to corroborate this, but I forgot it. R. Jose thus
objected, it reads \[II Chron. xxix. 19\]: "All the vessels which King
Achez had cast aside . . . have we put in order and sanctified." Does
not "put in order" mean a legal bath and "sanctify" to bring back to
sacredness, whence it is obvious that even such vessels that were used
in idol-worship are allowed to be brought into the temple for use, after
passing through the legal bath (the more so are allowed the vessels of
the Egyptian temple)? Thereupon said Rabbi: The blessing of the Lord
upon you: you have recalled to my memory the forgotten verse! "Put in
order" means to hide them, and "sanctify" to substitute them by other
vessels. Is Rabbi's interpretation supported by the following Mishna
(Midath, i. 6): There was a pantry in the temple, where the Maccabees
heaped up the stones of the altar defiled by the Greeks; and R. Sheshith
said: The Greeks have defiled the altar by their idol-worship, and
though these stones are allowed for private use, yet they were not used
in the temple. (Similar was the case with the vessels of the Egyptian
temple, which were allowed only for private use)? Said R. Papa: From the
case of the Maccabees is no support at all, since the stones there were
prohibited even for private use, the Maccabees guiding themselves by
\[Ezek. vii. 21\]: "And I will give it up into the hands of the
strangers . . . and they shall pollute it"; so that they could not do
otherwise, for, in order that the stones be again allowed, they must be
first profaned by breaking them, which is not permitted to do, as by law
"*whole* stones must be used to build an altar"; nor could the stones be
sawed into two (thereby becoming profaned), since the law forbids "to
bring iron thereon"; so that as there was no means to profane the said
stones, they were of necessity set aside. But why did not the Maccabees
have the stones profaned by a heathen and make of them private use? They
could not do even this, for as R. Oshia said: The sages wanted once to
forbid all use of gold and silver, because the enemy carried off the
gold and silver of the temple, it was, namely, feared that the money
coined therefrom might reach the Israelites, and by law it is prohibited
to make use of what belongs to the sanctuary. It was, however, objected:
How could the sages have conceived such a wish, the gold and silver of
Jerusalem forming but an infinitesimal part of those in the whole world,
and the smallest can never render

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

prohibited the greatest part. Abayi explained the words of R. Oshia
thus: The sages wanted to forbid not all the gold and silver, but only
the gold and silver dinars issued by both the kings Hadrian and Traion,
on which the image has become of late undiscernible, and which were
surely coined of the gold and silver of the temple. However, when their
attention was called to the verse, "And will give it into the hands of
strangers, etc., they abandoned the idea, seeing that an object once
profaned is allowed for private use. Now, as to the altar, it was a
sacred place to bring offerings to God, which is not the case with the
gold and silver; hence it is below dignity to use its stones in private.

MISHNA *IV*.: A heathen can profane his idol as well as that of his
neighbor. An Israelite cannot profane that of a heathen. The idol once
profaned, all that pertains to its service is abolished; on the
contrary, if only the pertainings were profaned, they alone are allowed,
but not the idol.

GEMARA: Rabbi taught to Simeon his son: A heathen may profane his idol
as well as that of his neighbor; said he to him: Master, in your youth
you used to teach that a heathen profanes his idol as well as that of an
Israelite. (Says the Gemara): Can then an Israelite's idol be profaned?
Was it not said above that such can never be profaned? Said R. Hillel b.
R. Wells: He spoke then of the case where the heathen owned the idol
with the Israelite in partnership. But let us see what was the reason of
both his statement in his youth and in his advanced age. In his youth he
thought that if an Israelite worships an idol, he does it with the
knowledge of the heathen, hence the heathen, when profaning his part,
profanes also that of the Israelite; while in his later days he came to
the conclusion that the Israelite is worshipping on his own account,
hence the heathen profanes only his own part, that of the Israelite
remaining unprofaned.

There were others who taught the statement of R. Hillel. as concerning
the latter part of our Mishna: An Israelite cannot profane that of a
heathen. And to the question, is this not self-understood? Said R.
Hillel b. Wells: It refers to a case where an Israelite and a heathen
are the joint owners of the idol, in which case the former can profane
neither his nor the heathen's part, while the latter may his own part
but not that of the Israelite. Others, however, bring this, R. Hillel's
explanation, in connection, not with the Mishna, but with the Boraitha
following.

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> R. Simeon b.
Menasia said: The idol of an Israelite can *never* be profaned; and this
"never" R. Hillel b. Wells interpreted to mean that, when an Israelite
and a heathen are the joint owners of an idol, the latter, by profaning
his own part, does by no means profane the other's part, though it may
be assumed here that the Israelite is a partner to the idol only out of
complacence to the heathen. And he comes thereby to teach us that an
Israelite worships an idol not on the knowledge of the heathen, but on
his own.

MISHNA *V*.: How is an idol to be profaned? By cutting off the tip of
its ear, the point of the nose, or the ends of the fingers, or by
disfiguring its face with a hammer, even if thereby nothing is broken
off. But if he only spat or urinated before it, dragged it about in the
dirt, or cast such upon it, it is not profaned. If a heathen sold or
pawned his idol it is profaned according to Rabbi, but not according to
the sages.

GEMARA: "*Disfiguring its face with a hammer*," etc. Why should it be
profaned when nothing of it was lost thereby? Said R. Zera: Because it
has thus been made unrecognizable.

"*But if he only spat*," etc. Whence is this deduced? Said 'Hiskia, from
\[Is. viii. 21, 22\]: "And when they shall be hungry, they will become
enraged and curse their king and their god . . . and they will look unto
the earth," etc., which means: Though the heathen curse his king and god
and look up to the true God, he will still turn his eye back to the
earth to worship his idol.

"*If a heathen sold*," etc. In respect of this part of the Mishna Zeera
in the name of R. Johanan and Jeremiah b. Abba in the name of Rabh
expressed thus their respective opinions. The one says: The decision of
the sages regards only the case when the heathen sold or pawned the idol
to a *heathen* jeweller, but if to a Jewish one all agree that it is
profaned; while the other holds that they differ also regarding the
latter case. The schoolmen asked: According to the latter view, how
should the Mishna be interpreted? Does Rabbi mean here that the idol in
question is profaned *only* or *even* when sold or pawned to a Jewish
jeweller, but if to a heathen he agrees with the sages? Come and hear.
Rabbi said: My view is correct in case the idol is sold to be destroyed,
and that of my colleagues, if to be worshipped. But broken and
worshipped must have here some specific meaning, for otherwise we should
obviously have no two opinions on the subject. And indeed, Rabbi intends

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

to say: An idol sold to an Israelite who will surely not worship, but
*break* it, while the sages speak of an idol sold to a heathen who will
surely not break, but *worship* it; hence they differ in both cases?
Nay; it may be said that Rabbi's statement means this: My view is
accepted by my colleagues, when the idol was sold to be destroyed, as
they differ only when sold for worship--to a heathen jeweller.

The rabbis taught: If an idol is pawned by a heathen, or it is buried
under the ruins of an old fallen house, or is stolen by burglars, or,
finally, is left standing alone by the heathen, who went to the
sea-countries, the question arises whether or no the heathen had in mind
to come back to it, as such was the case in t e time when Jehoshua had
war with the Amorites; if he had, the idol is not profaned. It is
obvious that all the four cases must needs be stated. The first case
implies that the heathen wants to have the idol back, while in the
second, the idol being left under the ruins, the heathen may be thought
as renouncing it, whereby it is profaned; hence the second statement. In
like manner does the third case imply something different from the
contents of the preceding cases: The ruins can possibly be removed, but
a burglary is less likely to be returned. Finally, the fourth case
teaches us again something new--viz: while in the third case the heathen
may yet think that the idol fell into the hands of *heathen* thieves and
they will worship it, or even if they be Israelites, they will sell it
to heathens, they themselves, having no use of it; in the fourth case he
abandons the idol of his own will, since he has not taken it along with
him. Hence all the four cases must be taught. Now, the concluding
sentence of the Boraitha must be thus understood: If the heathen has his
mind to come back as the Amorites did, it is necessary to treat the idol
in the same way as it was treated at those times--namely: Not to regard
it as profaned, but rather to annihilate it altogether. But did the
Amorites ever return? There was nothing of the kind! The answer is that
if he has in mind to return, his idol must be treated as in the war of
Jehoshua (though the Amorites have not returned). But if so, why the
comparison with Jehoshua's times? The Boraitha intends to teach by the
way yet what R. Jehudah said in the name of Rabh: If an Israelite erects
a brick to worship it, but does not worship, and a heathen comes and
worships it, it is prohibited, notwithstanding the rule that no one can
render a thing unallowable that is not his own; here the motive of the
Israelite is

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

determining. How does R. Jehudah substantiate this his opinion? Said R.
Elazor: He bases it on the proceedings of the Israelites upon their
entering the promised land; for it reads: "Their groves ye shall burn
with fire"; here, too, one could then wonder and say: The holy land,
having been promised by God to Abraham and his descendants, belonged to
the Israelites and not to the Amorites; how, then, could the latter have
rendered unallowable these groves that were not their own? If you are
ready to assume that these groves had sprung up before the promise, then
you must regard them as the idol of a heathen, whose profanation, as we
have seen above, suffices! Why then did not the Israelites compel the
heathens to profane it and then use it? Why were they ordered to burn it
down? In view of all this the verse, "Their groves," etc., must be thus
explained: The promised land is indeed regarded the ownership of the
Jews, and as Israel, by his worship of the golden calf in the
wilderness, exhibited his inclination toward idol-worship, the grove is
considered the idol of a Jew, worshipped by heathens only in accord with
the Jews, and as such can by no means be profaned, but must be
annihilated. And the case here with the brick is perfectly analogous.
However, is the conclusion from the golden calf to the grove warranted?
The Israelites might have been inclined exclusively toward calf-worship?
Nay; they declaimed at that time before the calf: These are your *gods*,
O Israel! whereby they must have meant a *variety of gods*, toward which
they felt disposed. Finally, that the prohibition was extended to *all*
groves and not only to those that were the contemporaries of the calf
and which the Israelites repented, is due to the fact that there was no
possibility to distinguish between old and newly-planted groves.

MISHNA *VI*.: An idol abandoned by its worshippers in time of peace is
allowed, but is forbidden when abandoned in time of war. Altars erected
for kings are allowed, for the idol is put on them only when the kings
pass.

GEMARA: R. Jeremiah b. Abba said in the name of Rabh: The House Nimrod
has the same regulations regarding idols as those abandoned by the owner
in time of peace, because, though scattered all the world over as if
driven about by war, it had the choice to return home and get its idols,
and by not doing so it showed a lack of interest in them, hence they are
allowed.

"*Altars erected for kings*," etc. Are they not, after all, altars of
the idol? Said Rabba b. b. 'Hana in the name of R.

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Johanan: It means
to say that the priests prepare the altars for the king, but he takes
another road, so that no idols nor offerings come upon these altars.
Ula, on his return from Palestine, alighted on one of such altars that
was broken; R. Jehudah, on noticing this, asked him why he acted thus
after both Rabh and Samuel had forbidden all use of such an altar when
broken; and even he who says that broken idols are no longer worshipped
and hence are allowed, does not assert the same with regard to altars,
as it would be disgraceful to worship a broken idol, but upon a broken
altar an idol may always be put. Hereupon replied Ula: My respect for
Rabh and Samuel is so great that I should readily fill my eyes with the
ashes of their corpses; none the less I cannot help refuting this
opinion, for R. Johanan and Resh Lakish said: An altar upon which idols
are habitually placed is, when broken, allowable; furthermore, even he
who holds that fragments are worshipped allows such an altar, as he
namely says: The broken idol is always, even when broken, worshipfully
regarded by the heathen, while no godliness is even imputed to an
altar--it is but a mere stand for idols--so that as soon as it is
broken, it is set aside without any regard. The, following Boraitha
expresses the same view of R. Johanan and Resh Lakish: An altar used as
a stand for idols is, when partly broken, allowable; however, an altar
used for sacrifices is, when broken, forbidden, until most of its stones
fall apart.

Which are the marks distinguishing the altar for sacrifices from that
used as a stand? R. Jacob b. Aidi said in the name of R. Johanan: The
latter kind consists of but *one* stone, while the former of several
stones. 'Hiskia adduces a verse to this effect \[Is. xxvii. 27, 9\]:
"When he maketh all the stones of the altar as limestones, that are
beaten in pieces, when there shall notarise again any groves and sun
images," *i.e.*, only when they are turned to lime no image is put on
them, nor sacrifice, then only is their use allowable.

There is a Boraitha: If one worships one's own animal, it is prohibited
from being used as a sacrifice in the temple, but not if it is his
neighbor's. There is a contradiction from the following Thosephtha: All
cattle is regarded as worshipped, immaterial whether the worship took
place by mistake or intention, by compulsion or free will. Now, what
other could be the meaning of compulsion than that one forces into his
house an animal of a stranger and worships it? Hence, cattle of a
stranger is prohibited, too, through worship. Thereupon said

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rami b. 'Hamma:
The word compulsion means that heathens compelled him to worship his own
animal.

R. Zera opposed: Does not the Scripture free a culprit by compulsion?
\[Deut. xxii. 26\]: "And to the damsel ye shall do nothing," etc.
Therefore said Rabha: The prohibition of worship was general, but from
the expression \[Levit. xviii. 5\]: "He shall live in them," whence the
rabbis infer but not "he shall die in them," compulsion was excluded;
however, thereafter it reads again, "He shall not profane my holy name,"
whence the rabbis infer that even if compelled, which, too, would
apparently contradict each other. The explanation is that compulsion
imposed privately is excused, but if publicly, one must not yield to it.
Said the rabbis to Rabha: There is a Boraitha that supports your
opinion: The altars of idols remain prohibited even after the evil
decrees of the government have ceased. Rejoined Rabha: If only this, it
cannot be a support to my opinion, for there may have been an apostate
Jew who worshipped it willingly. Said R. Ashi: Do not say "may have
been," as it is *certain* that there was such, and therefore the
prohibition remains forever. 'Hiskia, however, said that the
above-mentioned forcing of the neighbor's animal to worship means if he
pours wine between its horns for the idol, and not worshipped by bowing
to it. R. Adda b. Ahaba, however, opposed: Can, then, this be called
worship? One can worship an idol, while by pouring wine on the animal
for the idol he makes it only for an altar, and a living creature is not
forbidden when used in the service to the idol.

Therefore said R. Adda b. Ahaba: 'Hiskia must have meant: When the
animal is itself made some idol and then the wine poured to honor it, it
is forbidden, which view coincides with what Ula said in the name of R.
Johanan when returning from Palestine: Although strange cattle is
rendered forbidden by worship, yet it is prohibited as soon as some act
has been performed on its body. Said R. Na'hman: Go tell Ula that R.
Huna taught us this, having explained this Halakha long ago in Babylon:
An animal resting in the proximity of an idol becomes unallowable, as
soon as one cuts through its gullet or windpipe for the sake of the
idol, and be it the ownership of another one. Now, upon what can this
view be based? The report of the Boraitha concerning the barring of
priests, who were compelled to become such of an idol, from services in
the Jerusalem temple, contains hardly an analogy of compulsion; because
a priest

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

could flee and thus save himself, while an animal destitute of
intelligence could not. Nor can the Mishna, treating of the Maccabees,
who set aside the altar-stones upon which the Greeks committed some act
to honor an idol, be adduced as a basis, for R. Papa explained it
already, saying \[Ezek. vii. 22\]: "I turn my face from them, that they
may pollute my treasure," shows that the temple was profaned by the
arrival of the Greeks, and hence was no longer the ownership of God, but
considered as that of the Greeks. Thus, the view in question can be
based but on this passage \[II Chron. xxix. 19\]: "And all the vessels
which King Achaz had cast aside . . . have we put in order and
sanctified"; and the master said that they were hidden and substituted
by others, *i.e.*, they were prohibited. Now, these vessels were not the
ownership of Ahaz, and hence by his worship he could not possibly
profane them; we must thus assume that he committed with them some act
of honor to the idols, whereby he rendered them forbidden, and here is
applied the same rule in respect of cattle.

R. Dimi, on his return from Palestine, said in the name of R. Johanan:
Although the sages taught that, when one bows to uncultivated ground,
saying: This be my god, the ground is thereby not forbidden; yet if he
dug graves, pits or caves as an idol, the ground is prohibited. R.
Samuel b. Jehudah, on his return from Palestine, said in the name of R.
Johanan: It is true the sages said that an animal worshipped by others
than its proprietor is not forbidden; yet the animal obtained by the
idol-worshippers in exchange for an idol is forbidden. Rabin, when back
from Palestine, said: Concerning this topic R. Ismael b. R. Jose and the
sages have expressed two opinions, but it is not known who said which.
The one prohibits an animal exchanged for an idol, but allows the second
animal obtained in exchange for the first. The other opinion prohibits
the second animal, too, basing itself upon \[Deut. Vii. 26\]: ". . .
lest thou become accursed like it"; hence, it appears that whatever
comes from the accursed is *like it*, and is accordingly forbidden.

MISHNA *VII*.: The Jewish elders were asked by the philosophers at Rome:
If God is displeased with idol-worship, why does he not destroy the
idols? And they replied: If the heathens worshipped but things not
needful to the world, he would surely annihilate them; but the fact is
that they worship the sun, moon, stars and planets; should then God
destroy his world on account of these fools? Then retorted the others:

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Let God destroy
the unnecessary objects and leave the other? that are needed for the
preservation of the world. Replied the elders: If he did so, the
idol-worshippers would but be confirmed in their belief and say: Here
you see that these are gods, for they are indestructible.

GEMARA: The rabbis taught: The philosophers once questioned the elders
at Rome: If your God is displeased with idol-worship, why does he not
destroy the idols? And they replied: If the heathens worshipped but
things not needful to the world, he would surely annihilate them; but
they worship the sun, moon, stars and the planets; shall he destroy the
world because of the fools? But the Lord allows the world its natural
course, and as to these fools who spoil it, they will not escape
punishment--in other words, when some one steals wheat and sows it, the
seed should not bear fruit by reason of its being stolen; but nay, God
lets nature her course, while to the thief will be meted his due. In
like manner, adultery is not barren on its own account, but the culprit
is not spared. Resh Lakish says something to this effect: The Holy One,
blessed be he, says: Not only do the wicked of this earth forfeit my
coin, but they force me yet to put my stamp thereon.

A philosopher once asked Raban Gamaliel: Your law says \[Deut. iv. 24\]:
"For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, yea, a watchful God"; why is
it that he is so watchful with regard to the worshipper and not to the
idol? Said Raban Gamaliel: I will answer your question by a metaphor:
Suppose a king's son names his dog with the father's name and swears,
whenever he does, by the life of this dog; the father, once informed
about this, will he get angry at his son or at the dog? Naturally
enough, at the son. Thereupon said the philosopher: You call the idol
dog, which is not feasible, since the idol has loftier gifts. You ask
which are these? Why, once a conflagration consumed all our city, and
the idol temple remained intact. Answered R. Gamaliel: I shall use again
a metaphor: A province once revolted against the king; against whom do
you suppose he used his weapons, against the living or against the dead?
Naturally enough, against the former. Said the philosopher: You style
our gods dogs and dead; well, then, when they really are so worthless
why does not God annihilate them altogether? Yea, he would surely do it,
was the reply, were they not of objects useful to the preservation of
the world, such as are the sun, moon, stars, planets, mountains and

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

valleys, for it reads \[Zeph. i. 2, 3\]: "I will remove utterly all
things from off the face of the earth, saith the Lord. I will remove man
and beast; I will remove the fowls of the heaven, and the fishes of the
sea, and the stumbling blocks of the wicked." That is to say: The Lord
wonders, shall I do this when the heathens worship man, too? I should
have then to destroy the whole universe!

Agrippus, the general of Rome, said to Raban Gamaliel: "The Lord, thy
God, is a consuming fire," etc. In our everyday life we find it to be
the rule that a potentate is but jealous of his equal, a sage of another
sage, a hero of another hero, a rich of another rich; now, then, if God
is jealous of an idol, the idol must be of some power! R. Gamaliel
explained it to him with the following metaphor: If one who has a wife,
takes yet another one, the former will not be jealous unless the new
wife be a nothing compared with herself.

An Israelite named Zunan said to R. Aqiba: I know just as well as you do
that the idols are nothing, yet I should like to know, how is it that so
many cripples are cured by the idols in their temples? Replied R. Aqiba:
Listen to the following parable. There lived once in a town a pious man
who enjoyed the unlimited confidence of his fellow townsmen so that they
would deposit with him money and were it without any witness, with the
exception, however, of one who would leave with him nothing without
witness. It once happened, however, that this exceptional man left
something in the hands of the other without any security; thereupon said
the wife of the latter: Now we shall revenge on that distrustful man his
mistrust to us, let us deny that he has a deposit with us; retorted her
husband: Because of the short-comings of his understanding shall I put
my reputed name on stake? No; this I shall never do! The same is the
case with debility, disease and pains visited upon man; they are under
oath assigned a certain time, no more, no less, during which to torture
a man; it is further predestined by what man or what medicine the
disease be eliminated. Now, when its time is off, the afflicted goes to
the idol-temple; the disease protests, saying: because the man takes
recourse to the idol, I should not abandon him, but as I am bound by
oath I should not break it on account of this foolish man; thus the
disease leaves him and he believes that it was the work of the idol. R.
Johanan explained it from \[Deut. xxviii. 59\]: "Then will the Lord
render peculiar thy plagues . . . and sicknesses

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

sore and *neemonim*" (literally trustful); sore, for the man suffers
therefrom, and trustful, for it never breaks its oath.

Rabha b. R. Itz'hak said to R. Jehudah: There is an idol in our town,
and whenever there is drought by us, it comes in dream to the priests,
saying: Sacrifice a human being to me and you shall have rain; and this
condition fulfilled, it in reality begins to rain. Thereupon said R.
Jehudah: You may esteem yourselves fortunate that I am yet among the
living, for were I dead, I should not be in a position to communicate to
you what Rabh said thereabout--viz.: it reads \[ibid. iv. 19\]: "And
that thou lift not up thy eyes unto the heavens, and thou seest the sun,
and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be misled to bow
down to them . . . which Lord thy God hath assigned unto all nations
it"; you see from here that God has given some power to some worshipped
objects for the purpose of barring their worshippers from the world to
come. And this is what Resh Lakish says elsewhere, it reads \[Prov. iii.
34\]: "If it concern the scornful, he will himself render them a scorn,
but unto the lowly lives he gives grace," whence, if one comes to defile
himself, the door is opened to him, while when one comes to cleanse
himself, he is supported.

MISHNA *VIII*.: It is allowable to buy a wine-press from a heathen even
while he takes grapes therefrom and puts them into the heap of grapes.
The wine is not considered offered ere it reaches the reservoir, while
upon reaching it all that is in it is (provided the heathen touches it)
forbidden, the rest is allowed. It is allowed to tread but not to gather
the grapes jointly with a heathen. It is forbidden both to tread and to
gather with an Israelite who prepares the wine while he is unclean; it
is, however, allowed to help him convey empty casks to, and then filled
ones back from, the press. It is forbidden to assist a baker, who, in a
state of uncleanness, prepares his bread, in kneading or ordering, but
one may help him carry the bread to the dealer.

GEMARA: R. Huna said: As soon as the wine trickles from the grapes, the
touch of a heathen renders it unallowable. It was objected thereto from
the Mishna: "It is allowed to buy a wine-press," etc., whence it is
manifest that the wine on beginning to trickle is not forbidden.
Whereupon it was rejoined: R. Huna. understands that the press in
question is propped up at the bottom, and that an Israelite filled it
first with grapes, the heathen having added some not until later. Come
and hear another objection! The Mishna goes on to say: . . . while

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

upon reaching the reservoir all the wine that is in it is forbidden, the
rest is allowed, whence, only the wine that flows down is forbidden;
said R. Huna, the sages have afterward retracted this Mishna, as in the
following Boraitha: The rabbis held originally that it is not allowed to
gather grapes jointly with a heathen, for what the latter gathers is
unclean and defiles by touch the grapes gathered by the Israelite, which
are considered wine. They further warned against contributing toward the
conditions defiling the fruit in Palestine, as well as against assisting
an Israelite who defies the rules of cleanness, in treading the
wine-press, because one must not help a transgressor in his work; while
the heathen may be aided, for he is not bound by the rules of clean and
unclean. Finally, the wine does not become offered by the sole fact of
treading, for R. Huna's opinion on this point has been rejected.
However, the sages, as said above, retracted this view, asserting:
Assistance to a heathen in treading is [forbidden](errata.htm#60.md), for
the grape-juice is offered wine immediately upon trickling, so that the
assisting Israelite would get remunerated for working on what is not
allowed; Such is also R. Huna's opinion. Nor is it allowable to gather
or tread grapes with an Israelite who defies the rules of cleanness, for
every Israelite is obliged to give from his fruit Teruma to the priest,
and here the clean grapes are rendered unclean by the others, thus
defiling also the Teruma, which is not allowed as to a heathen, it is
allowed to gather with him, as he is free from Teruma, and fruits
exempted from Teruma may be caused to be defiled even in Palestine.

"*The wine is not considered offered ere*," etc. Concerning tithe,
however, there is a Mishna that it is obligatory as soon as the
grape-pits swim up, since this is an index of wine. Said Rabha: This
presents no difficulty; as regards tithe we have the opinion of R.
Aqiba, while the Mishna is in accordance with the other sages; as a
Mishna states: In the case of tithe, the index of wine is its flowing
into the reservoir. R. Aqiba, however, says: It is the swimming up of
the grape-pits. Hereupon it was asked: How should this *swimming up of
the pits* be understood? Does it refer to the case when the wine, after
filling the reservoir to a certain point, causes the pits to rise to the
surface, or to the case when the wine is already in the casks, and
during its fermentation the pits come up to the surface? Come and hear
the following Boraitha: It is called wine when the pits swim up;
accordingly, it is allowed to drink the wine from the

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

press as well as from the pipe connecting it with the reservoir, whence
it is obvious that the first of the two cases is referred to. But has
not R. Zebid taught this Boraitha in the name of the disciples of R.
Oshia, as follows: It is called wine when poured into the reservoir and
when the pits swim up, while R. Aqiba requires its being put yet into
the casks; from here it is apparent that the sages as well as R. Aqiba
are involved in a contradiction, from which to extricate them is
necessary to interpret the former version of the Boraitha in the light
of R. Zebid's Boraitha. Now, taking account of the Mishna, we shall have
*three* opinions regarding the here-disputed point. The Mishna declares
it wine when it reaches the reservoir; the sages when, the wine being
therein, the pits swim up; finally, R. Aqiba, not before it is in the
casks? The answer is that the Mishna may be so interpreted as to agree
with both the other views, since the sages and R. Aqiba differ only in
as far as the index of wine for *tithe* is concerned, while the Mishna
treats of the index of wine to become offered which is very rigorous. As
to Rabha, however, he must rest satisfied with the three opinions as
opposed to one another, as he makes no difference between the said
cases.

"*What is in it is forbidden, and the rest is allowed*." R. Huna
explains this as follows: The rest in the press is allowed only when the
cleansing basket through which the wine passes on its way from the press
to the reservoir in order to be cleaned of the husks, is not again
emptied into the press. But why should the contents of the basket be
forbidden, the heathen having touched only the wine in the reservoir?
There can hardly be another reason than that the wine of the upper
vessel and flowing into the lower one be considered as a whole, and that
the flow thus connects the two wines into one? And yet this question, as
to whether or no the flow be a connecting link between the two wines in
the above sense, propounded elsewhere, has found no satisfactory answer.
And as our foregoing discussion has not been resorted to in this
connection, it must not be assumed that the flow is no connecting link,
but as R. 'Hyya explains it: When the two vessels are full of wine so
that, their mouths being near, the wines touch each other, they are
regarded as one wine. Accordingly in our case the reservoir must be so
full of wine as to touch the basket, so that when the contents thereof
are emptied into the press, what is in the latter also becomes
forbidden.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

It is related of a boy who in his sixth year was well versed in the
Tract Idolatry. Once he was asked whether an Israelite and a heathen may
jointly tread a wine-press? His answer was in the affirmative,
notwithstanding R. Huna's negative view. And to the objection that the
heathen renders the wine forbidden by his touching the grapes, the boy
retorted: Have the hands of the heathen wrapped up with cloth, so that
he might not touch the grapes with *bare* hands. Finally, upon being
further asked that the heathen may touch the grapes with his feet, he
replied that touching by foot is not considered.

It once happened that an Israelite and a heathen jointly hired and
worked a wine-press in the City of Nahardea; R. Samuel, asked as to how
to behave with regard to this wine, hesitated to answer until after
three festivals during which the sages were in assembly; for he wanted
to first propound this question to them. The question arises, why was he
anxious to hear the opinion of the sages? If because he expected to find
one of them entertaining the opinion of R. Nathan, then we must say that
he wanted to prohibit all benefit of this wine; for it was taught: If
the heathen measures out the wine with the hand or foot, Israelites must
not drink it, but it may be sold to heathens; while R. Nathan prohibits
all benefit of wine measured by hand. But now that R. Nathan makes no
reference to the measure by foot, it must be assumed that Samuel was not
waiting for his opinion, but he rather expected to find one of the sages
in favor of R. Shimon's view, which allows the wine, even to consume,
provided it was not touched by the heathen intentionally.

It once happened at Biram that a certain heathen climbed up a palm-tree
to get down some branches. On coming down he unwittingly touched with
one of the branches a cask of wine. Rabh was asked on the point, and he
prohibited Israelites from drinking this wine, allowing, however, its
sale to heathens. Thereupon R. Kahana and R. Assi interposed: I-lave
you, master, not yourself taught that even a one-day-old child of a
heathen renders the wine prohibited when touching it? And in this case
there is surely no intention involved! Answered Rabh: I prohibited only
to *drink* it, but not to sell it and use the money thereof.

The text says: Rabh holds "that even a one-day-old child of a heathen,"
etc. R. Shimi b. Hyya advanced the following objection: When one buys
slaves from a heathen, has them circumcised but not bathed in the legal
bath, the place they tread

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

on as well as what they spit out, is unclean. Precisely the same is the
case with the acquired children of a female slave; but according to
others the children are clean. In the case of wine the same rule holds:
Adults render it forbidden by touch, but not children. What is an adult?
When already familiar with the nature of idol-worship, and is considered
a child before that period. We see, then, from this Boraitha, that
contrary to Rabh's position, a child does not make the wine unallowable
by mere touch? The answer is that the "child" spoken of in this Boraitha
is one born of a female slave in the house of an Israelite; as to other
children, inclusive of slaves bought of a heathen, Rabh's precept holds
good. But here is another question. The Boraitha says: The same is the
case with the children of a female slave, which would suggest the
inference that there is no difference between a slave bought, or one
brought up in the house of an Israelite. The answer is that this phrase
refers only to their spittle and the place trodden on by them. However,
this explanation is correct according to him who says that these are
unclean, but what according to him who declares them clean? He comes to
teach us that adult slaves bought, circumcised and then legally bathed,
do not make the wine forbidden by touch, just as the children of a
female slave. The Boraitha states this in order to exclude the opinion
cited by R. Na'hman in the name of R. Samuel to the effect that when an
Israelite buys slaves from a heathen, has them circumcised and legally
bathed, they none the less render the wine forbidden all the time, till
they cease to mention the name of the idol and wholly forget it. And how
long is this time? R. Jehoshua b. Levi set the limit of this period at
twelve months.

In the town Mechusa a heathen once happened to enter the house of a
Jewish wine-seller, who answered his question as to whether he sells
wine, in the negative. The heathen, noticing on the table a little wine
in a vessel with which the Jew used to serve wine, put his hand right
into it, saying: Is not this wine? The host, excited over this misdeed,
emptied the vessel back into the cask; so that he had to consult Rabha
what to do with the wine? He advised him to sell it to heathens. When R.
Huna b. 'Hinna and R. Huna b. R. Na'hman heard of this incident, they
said that all benefit of this wine is forbidden. Thereupon, Rabha
heralded that the wine may be sold to heathens; while the both Hunas let
herald the opposite. Some time after, R. Huna b. R. Na'hman happened to
be in Mechusa where

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rabha resided; so
Rabha instructed his servant not to admit anybody at the time when Huna
will be by him, since they, two, will be busied with the settlement of
an important dispute. R. Huna, on coming to him, opened, indeed, the
foregoing question, and, to his great astonishment, Rabha said that all
use of that wine is forbidden. And to the question: Has not the master
allowed such a case, he answered: In this particular case it was the
wine in the cask that I allowed, but the wine touched by the heathen and
poured back into the cask I prohibited, requiring rather that its worth
be cast into the sea. It is true, I once allowed also the other wine,
but during my sojourn at Pumbedita, Nahmani (Abayi) adduced so many
Boraithas and conclusions of other sages against my tenet, that I
withdrew my former opinion, and now I prohibit the wine poured back; for
among others, Nahmani told me of such a case in Nahardea, and Samuel
prohibited the wine; in another case at Tiberia, R. Johanan has likewise
forbidden. I attempted to argue: Samuel and R. Johanan may have been led
to such stringency by the fact that at those places the population is
ignorant, in which case rigorous legislation is commendable; but he
replied: Do you think that Mechusa is more enlightened than Nahardea and
Tiberia? He also called my attention to the following Thosephtha: It
once happened that the excise collectors poured back into the cask the
wine left after they had had a drink; one of them drew also some wine
with a lever, putting the lever back in the cask, and the sages
prohibited this wine for all benefit.

R. Johanan b. Arza and R. Jose b. Nehorai were once sitting together
indulging a little in wine, when a man came in. They told him to pour in
for them; but no sooner had he fulfilled their order than they
discovered that he was a heathen. Thereupon one of the two said: The
wine is absolutely forbidden, while the other asserted that it is even
allowable to drink. Said R. Jehoshua b. Levi: Both had their respective
opinions well grounded; the former must have reasoned thus: The man knew
us to be of the sages, and he could easily notice that we were going to
drink wine, which, when ordered by us to pour in, he would, in his
thought, render prohibited. While the other one must have reasoned the
other way--viz.: The man, knowing us to be of the sages, surely thought
that we drank no wine, since otherwise we should not order him, a
heathen, to pour in for us, hence the wine is allowed. But, against the
latter it may be asked: Did not the heathen see that it was wine? Nay,
it

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

all took place in the evening. Neither could he discern it by *smell*,
as it was new wine, which has no smell. That he did not touch it is
certain, for the wine was in a bottle; and the shaking of the wine by a
heathen is prohibited only when done intentionally, which was not here
the case.

R. Assi questioned R. Johanan: Does a heathen render the wine prohibited
by pouring water into it? Yea, was the answer; for a Nazarite must be
told: Go around, go around, but do not approach the vineyard in order
not to yield to temptation and eat from its fruit. R. Jeremiah, when
once in Sabatta, noticed that the heathens there are wont to dilute the
wine that the Jews drink, and he reminded them of the foregoing warning
to a Nazarite. It was taught likewise in the name of R. Johanan,
according to others R. Assi, in his name: Wine diluted by a heathen is
forbidden by reason of temptation as above.

Resh Lakish was once in Bozrah (a town conquered by the King David in
the province of Moab). He saw the Jews there eat fruit without having
separated the tithe thereof, and he told them that this is not allowed.
He further noticed that the Jews were wont to drink the water
consecrated by the heathens, and prohibited it, too. Later he happened
to visit R. Johanan to whom he related his observations and
prohibitions, and R. Johanan told him: Go right back and allow all you
have prohibited, because you mistook Bozrah for Betzer which was
conquered by Moses, and where the tithe is thus obligatory; and as to
the water there, it is public ownership which, as such, cannot be
prohibited at all.

R. Hyya b. Abba made once a journey to Gabla, where he observed that
Jewesses were pregnant from heathens, who, though circumcised, were not
yet legally bathed. He further saw that the Jews were drinking the wine
diluted by the heathens; he also noticed that Jews were eating *Turmus*
(fig-bean) cooked by heathens. He, however, did not interfere. When he
later reported this to R. Johanan, the latter said: Go right back and
have it publicly announced that their children are bastards, the wine is
to be regarded *nessech* (idolatrous libation), and the *Turmus* is
forbidden like all other things cooked by heathens, because the
inhabitants of Galba are uneducated. With reference to the children, R.
Johanan expressed the same opinion elsewhere, saying that one is not
considered a proselyte unless he is both circumcised and legally bathed,
hence the above are still considered heathens; and Rabba b. 'Hana said
in the name

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

of R. Johanan: When a heathen or a slave seduces a Jewish girl, the
offspring is regarded as a bastard. The wine he prohibited by reason of
temptation as said above, and the *Turmus*, because they are there
uneducated, otherwise it would be allowed.

R. Kahana was once asked whether it is allowed to hire a heathen for
conveying grapes to the wine-press of an Israelite; hi s answer was in
the negative, by reason of the temptation above-mentioned. R. Yemer
objected to him from this Tosephtha: The grapes carried by a heathen to
the press, be it in a basket or any other vessel, are allowed even when
trickling. Said R. Kahana: This is no weighty objection, for here it
treats of grapes *already carried*, which I, too, should allow, but not
to hire one originally for such work.

Once a citron chanced to fall into a cask of wine; a heathen seeing
this, hurried to take it out with his hand, and R. Ashi ordered to hold
his arm fast in order to prevent it from moving, then to open the faucet
and have the wine flow into another vessel, when it will be allowed for
sale. The same R. Ashi said that wine made prohibited by the touch of a
heathen is not allowed to be sold to other heathens; the heathen,
however, who touched it, may be made to pay for the wine by considering
the thing in a manner as if the heathen had spilled or in some other way
destroyed the wine, when it would be legitimate to recover the loss.
This, his opinion, he corroborates by the following Boraitha: If a
heathen renders the wine prohibited by touch, not however, in the
presence of an idol, all benefit of it is forbidden. But R. Jehudah b.
Baba and R. Jehudah b. Bethira say it is allowed, and on the following
grounds: In the first place, because the act was done not in the
presence of an idol, and secondly because the Israelite may say to the
heathen: The wine is not your ownership, hence you cannot make it
forbidden. Now, though we do not agree with the two Jehudahs, the
inference is nevertheless justified that the Israelite may make the
heathen pay.

It once happened that the bung burst out of the hole of a cask with
wine, and a heathen ran by, put his hand upon the bung-hole to stop the
escape of the wine. Thereupon said R. Papa: The wine above the bung is
forbidden, the rest is allowed. R. Papa was further teaching: The wine
of leather bags carried by a heathen who is followed by a supervising
Israelite, is allowed if it so fills the bags that it cannot shake at
all, but if not so full, it is forbidden. If, however, the wine be in
open

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

pitchers, the converse is the case, because out of a full pitcher the
wine may overflow upon the hands of the heathen, and then touch back the
wine inside the pitcher, while with the pitcher that is not full this
cannot be feared. R. Ashi maintains that even the wine in a leather bag
that is not full cannot be made prohibited by shaking, for it is not
customary to offer wine by shaking. If the heathen put wood upon the
grapes in the press in order to squeeze the wine out by this pressure,
R. Papa allows the wine, while R. Ashi, according to others R. Simi b.
Ashi, prohibits it; all, however, agree in that the wine is allowed when
the wood is pressed down by means of a wheel, for the work is done but
by a derivative of his force, but when the heathen exerts the pressure
by his feet, only R. Papa allows, while the others forbid the wine.

Once a heathen pressed the wine by means of a wheel, yet R. Jacob from
Nahar Pekod declared the wine prohibited. At another time a cask with
wine happened to burst, and a heathen was holding it together until the
wine was emptied into another barrel; Raphran b. Papa, according to
others R. Huna b. R. Jehoshua, allowed to sell the wine to heathens. It
was prohibited to drink it, because the cask burst lengthwise, so that
it was necessary to hold it together, but if it had burst crosswise it
could have been held together by pressing the upper part; in this case
the wine would have been allowed even to drink, because the pressure of
a stone could have done the same service.

Once a heathen was found in the press of an Israelite; though there was
no wine in it, yet it was moist, and the question came up as to what to
do with the press? R. Ashi decided it thus: If the humidity of the press
was so great that an object could therein become so moist as to moisten
another object, the press must be first rinsed with water and then
scrubbed with ashes two times, while by a smaller degree of humidity one
rinsing suffices.

MISHNA *IX*: A heathen standing near the wine reservoir renders the wine
forbidden, provided he has a lien on it, but not otherwise. When a
heathen falls into a wine-reservoir. and is then brought up (dead), or
when a heathen measured the wine with a pipe, dragged therewith a hornet
out of the wine, or, finally, tapped his hand on the cask against the
ebullitions of the fermenting wine--all which cases have actually
occurred--the wine should, according to the rabbis, be sold; R. Simeon
allows to drink it. If the heathen, while enraged, cast the cask

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

into the reservoir, as it once happened, the sages allowed the wine.

GEMARA: Said Samuel: The lien spoken of in the Mishna must be had on the
wine itself; and R. Ashi proved this by quoting another Mishna, which
says: When one works a heathen's wine in accordance with the rules of
cleanness (so that he might sell it to Israelites), leaves it then in
the premises of the heathen, but under the supervision of an Israelite,
and the heathen writes a note to him stating, "I have received of you
money," the wine is allowed; if, however, the affair takes place this
way: The Israelite attempts to take out the wine and the heathen refuses
it until he get the money, which case once occurred at Beth-Shean, the
sages declare this wine prohibited, because it is yet the ownership of
the heathen. But if the lien had been on the Israelite's property, even
the wine included, it does not matter.

"*When a heathen falls*," etc. According to R. Papa this means that the
heathen is brought up dead, otherwise all benefit of the wine is
forbidden, because the heathen celebrates his escape, and thanks on this
account his idol, wherefore the wine is considered offered.

"*When a heathen measured the wine with a pipe, etc., the rabbis allow
to sell it, R. Simeon also to drink it*." Said R. Ada b. Ahba: Blessed
be the head of R. Simeon who, unlike the rabbis, goes to extremes--viz:
If he prohibits, he prohibits to derive all benefit therefrom, and if he
allows, he allows it even to drink. Said R. 'Hisda: I was told by Abba
b. 'Hannan that so said Zera, that the Halakha prevails with R. Simeon.
(Says the Gemara): After all, the Halakha does not prevail with him.

MISHNA *X*.: If an Israelite, who had cleansed the wine of a heathen,
left it in the latter's premises, in a house opening into a public
ground, in a town where heathens and Jews live, the wine is allowable;
but if there live only heathens, the wine is not allowed, unless a
Jewish watchman take care of it. However, the watchman must not
continually stay there, but may go and come. R. Simeon b. Elazar says:
All heathen premises are of the same account. If one cleanses the wine
of a heathen, leaves it in his premises (as above), and the latter
writes him a note stating, "I have received money from you," the wine is
allowed. But if the case be such that when the Israelite wants to take
out the wine the heathen refuses, requiring to be paid first (as it once
occurred at Beth-Shean), the sages prohibit the wine.

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

GEMARA: Why should the Mishna forbid the wine in a town where Jews do
not reside, since in any town you find Jews coming there now and then
for traffic? Says Samuel: The Mishna has in view but such towns that are
provided with walls and gates, so that no one can enter it without
special permission, and the heathen is thus in a position to know
whether or no there is an Israelite in town. R. Joseph said: It suffices
that the wine be so kept in a house that any Israelite could see from
his window into the heathen's yard, and the house must not needs be
opening into a public place. In like manner it is sufficient that there
be in the proximity of the house a little elevation where people are
wont to assemble, or that a date-tree be there, since in this case the
heathen may fear lest someone should climb up the tree for dates and
descry his doings in the same time; but if the top of the tree be cut
off, its influence is discussed by R. Acha and Rabina, the one saying
that the tree, now that it bears no fruit, exerts no influence upon the
heathen, who, thinking that nobody will climb it up now, may break the
seal and take out some of the wine; while the other says: People are
still now and then climbing upon such tree in order to look for their
strayed cattle, and hence it is yet fear-inspiring to the heathen.

The rabbis taught: When an Israelite buys or rents a house in the
courtyard of a heathen, where also an Israelite lives, and puts there
his wine, it is allowed even if not sealed and locked up. But if the
other Israelite lives in the same town only, the wine is allowed only
when sealed and locked. However, if a heathen hires Jews to prepare wine
for sale to Jews, and this wine remains in the premises of the heathen,
a Jew living in the same house where the wine is kept, it is allowed,
provided it be sealed and locked by a Jew who should himself have charge
of the key and seal. Said R. Johanan to him who cited before him this
Boraitha, read the last passage thus: The wine is allowed even when not
sealed and locked, provided only an Israelite lives in the same house.
If, however, an Israelite lives in the same city but not in the same
yard, the wine is forbidden even when sealed and locked; so says R.
Meier, while the rabbis say: An Israelite must either sit there and
watch, or come there at certain times. The question now arises, to which
case the rabbis refer, as there are four cases in the Boraitha? To
assume that they refer to the last case would be to assume a redundance,
since R. Mair said the same; nor can it be assumed that

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

they refer to the third case, where the wine, when sealed and locked by
a Jew, is allowed; because, as R. Johanan allows it even when not sealed
and locked, there would be no reason to account for the exceptional
rigor of the rabbis in this case. Hence, it is manifest that they refer
to the second case, which allows the wine put up in the house of a
heathen, when both there lives a Jew in the same town and also when the
wine is sealed and locked; and it is here that the rabbis add the
limitation that ail Israelite watch the wine, or come to it at certain
times. But what is gained by the last point? When the Jew is to come
there only at *certain* times, the heathen will know it and find his
time to break the seal and do what he pleases? The answer is this: We
must assume that the Jew is to come there *at times* and not at
*certain* times, so that the heathen will know nothing definite.

"*R. Simeon b. Elazar says, all heathen premises*," etc. The schoolmen
propounded a question: What does R. Simeon intend with this doctrine, to
make the regulations of wine more rigorous or more lenient? R. Jehudah
said in the name of Zeira, the latter is the case, while R. Na'hman said
in the name of the same authority the former was intended. In order to
make R. Jehudah's opinion plausible, it is necessary to insert the
following in the Mishna: The same prohibition is imposed upon wine
brought into the house of another heathen, because of fear lest the
latter should go to the proprietor and say: You are free to come to my
house and do with your wine as you please; I will not betray you
provided, however, you promise to serve me in the same way in case I
will have Jews prepare wine; it is in this connection that R. Simeon b.
Elazar said: Are, then, all premises of the same account? We see that if
the wine is left in the premises of the proprietor, an Israelite must
watch it; if, however, the wine is stored with another heathen, this
watch is not requisite, as I do not believe that the heathens would
enter such mutual agreements with one another. On the other hand, in
order to make R. Na'hman's view of R. Simeon's position plausible, the
following wording must be given to the inserted passage: The prohibition
is only then in force when the wine is left in the premises of the
proprietor with a Jew watching it; but if the wine is left with another
heathen, the additional watch is unnecessary, as we do not believe in
the mutual agreement of the heathens. To which R. Simeon b. Elazar says:
All heathen premises account alike, hence as the

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

watching by a Jew is there requisite, it is so here, too, for I fear,
indeed, that the heathen may enter some mutual understanding. There is a
Boraitha in accordance with R. Na'hman: R. Simeon b. Elazar says, all
premises of heathens are of the same account, for we fear lest they
deceive us.

It once happened that Israelites bought of Parsik, the viceroy, the
grapes of a vineyard in order to prepare wine therefrom; they then left
the wine with Parsik's gardeners without having paid for it. Hereupon
the disciples of Rabha's college wanted to allow the wine on the ground
that there cannot possibly be a mutual agreement between the viceroy and
his gardeners. Said Rabha to them: just in this case there is much to
fear, because if Parsik wants to falsify the wine, he will meet no
barrier.

Once a few casks of wine belonging to an Israelite were lying in the
street, and a heathen was found standing among them; Rabha, upon being
asked what is to be done with the wine, said: If this man is known to be
a thief, the wine is allowed, for he will fear to touch the wine in the
open street, lest he be suspected of stealing it; but if he is an honest
man the wine is forbidden, because of the reasonable fear, maybe he
touched it.
