# CHAPTER II.

RULES AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE COGNITION OF DEFILEMENT; ITS TWO
KINDS, SUBDIVIDED INTO FOUR, AND THEIR ILLUSTRATIONS.--THE CEREMONIAL
ACCOMPANYING THE CONSECRATION OF THE EXTENSIONS BUILT IN THE COURT-YARD
OF THE TEMPLE, AND IN JERUSALEM IN GENERAL.--ILLUSTRATIONS OF POSITIVE
COMMANDMENTS THAT DO OR DO NOT ENTAIL LIABILITY.

MISHNA *I*.: The cognition of uncleanness is of two kinds subdivided
into four--viz.: when one after having become unclean perceives it and
then forgets all about it, knowing, however, that what he eats is holy;
or when he was ignorant of the fact that the food is holy, being,
however, aware of his uncleanness; or, finally, when both facts having
escaped his memory he ate from the holy food without being cognizant
thereof, but learning it after he had eaten, he is to bring a rich or
poor offering. If he became unclean and knew it, forgot it afterward,
but was fully conscious that he was in the sanctuary or he forgot that
it was the sanctuary but knew his uncleanness; or, both facts having
escaped his cognition, he enters the sanctuary without knowing it to be
such and learns this fact only after he has gone out, he is to bring a
foregoing offering.

It is immaterial whether the unclean one enters the courtyard (of the
temple) or its extension, since extensions are added to both city and
courtyard (of the temple) only in the presence of a king, prophet,
*Urim* and *Tumim*, and of the grand Sanhedrim consisting of
seventy-one, two thanks-offerings and the chorus; the whole court of
justice steps forth, followed by the two thanks-offerings and then all
Israel; the inner bread is consumed, the outer one is burnt. But
whatever has not been constructed in this manner, does not entail guilt
upon him who being unclean enters it.

If one having become unclean in the courtyard of the temple forgot it,
remembering, however, that he is in the holy temple; or forgot that he
is in the temple but was aware of his uncleanness; or, both facts having
escaped his cognition, he made a

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

bow or was lingering there for an interval taken up by the making of a
bow, or went out by the longer way, he is guilty; but if by the short
way, be is not guilty. This is a positive command concerning the holy
temple, for disobeying of which one is not guilty.

And which is the positive command concerning menstruation that entails
guilt? If one being in relation with a clean woman is told by her: I
have just become unclean, and thereupon immediately interrupts his
relation with her, he is guilty, for separation from her affords him as
much pleasure as his coming to her. R. Eliezar says: One is guilty for
forgetting the cause of his uncleanness to have been a reptile, but is
not guilty for forgetting (that he is in) the holy temple. R. Aquiba
says (it reads): If he has become ignorant of being unclean, whence it
follows that he is guilty of obliviousness as regards uncleanness but
not as regards the holy temple. R. Ismael says: The phrase "it will
escape his memory" is repeated twice to declare one guilty in both
cases: for forgetting his uncleanness as well as for forgetting the
sanctuary.

GEMARA: Said R. Papa to Abayi: It states "two divided into four,"
whereas it ought to be "into six"--viz.: the cognition of defilement of
the holy food, and of the sanctuary, in each case antecedent and
subsequent. Answered Abayi: According to your theory there ought to be
eight subdivisions, as cognition of defilement may be accompanied with
ignorance of holy food and of the sanctuary. Rejoined R. Papa: In
reality there are eight; the Mishna, however, does not count the first
four, which are not at all found in the Scripture (*i.e.*, the Scripture
finds one liable, *e.g.*, for eating illegal fat irrespective of his
antecedent cognition or ignorance of its being illegal; he must then
bring a sin-offering after becoming aware of the fact, hence, of the
preceding cognition there is no mention in the Scripture).

"*It is immaterial . . . enters the courtyard*," etc. Whence is this
ceremony attending the extension of courtyards deduced? Said R. Shimi b.
Hyye, from \[Exod. xxv. 9\]: "In accordance with all that I show thee,
the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments
thereof, even so shall ye make it," which last phrase means for the
future generations (otherwise this phrase would be superfluous). <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md)

"*When two thanks-offerings*," etc. There is a Boraitha that

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

the two thanks-offerings mean their bread and not flesh. Whence is this
deduced? Said R. 'Hisda, from \[Neh. xii. 31\]: "And I have prepared two
large thanks-offerings." Now, what signifies the attribute "large"?
Shall we assume that it means literally, then it should read bullocks!
Or should it indicate merely that of their kind they were the large
ones; now, does it make a difference before heaven? Does not a Boraitha
state: Concerning a cattle burnt-offering it reads \[Lev. i. 13\]:
"Sweet savor unto the Lord"; the same expression concerns a fowl
burnt-offering \[ibid., ibid. 17\]; likewise concerning a meal offering
the same term is used \[ibid. ii. 2\], which is intended to teach that
before heaven all offerings, liberal as well as poor, are equal,
provided they are offered to gratify the heavenly Father? It remains,
therefore, to assume that the attribute, large, means simply the greater
part of the thanks-offerings, *i.e.*, the leaven bread, as there is a
Mishna teaching that the thanks-offering was five Jerusalem saahs large,
which are equal to six country saahs, making two eiphas each of three
saahs, altogether twenty tens, ten of which were leaven and the other
ten of matzah. The matzah, however, consisted of three kinds: cakes,
wafers, and of what was sodden (hence, the leaven cakes were threefold
those of the matzah).

Rami b. 'Hama said: The courtyard was sanctified with the remains of a
meal-offering only, in order to make it equal to the City of Jerusalem
itself--viz.: as the rule about the things, eatable within the city
renders them invalid if carried outside the city, so also with things
eatable within the courtyard, they become invalid out side of this yard
(and a meal-offering was to be eaten only within the courtyard). Now,
lest one say that as the city is to be sanctified with the leaven cakes
of the thanks-offering, so also the remains of the meal offering
sanctifying the courtyard be of leaven, the answer would be that there
can be no meal offering of leaven, since it reads \[Lev. vi. 10\]: "It
shall not be baked leaven, as their portion," etc., which Resh Lakish
interprets to mean that not even a portion thereof be baked leaven;
hence, the above supposition is impossible. But again, why not sanctify
with the two breads of Pentecost which are leaven? Nay; this cannot be
admitted either; because how can this be carried out? Supposing the
courtyard to be built before Pentecost, then the breads becoming holy
only upon the slaughtering of the two lambs, are not yet capable of
sanctifying; furthermore, the sanctification must take place on the day
of

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

completing the building, hence, the sanctification on the holiday is out
of question; nor can it be supposed that the temple be finished on the
holiday, since there is a rule that the temple must not violate
holidays; finally, to leave the two breads for the morrow of the holiday
is not feasible, for they would become invalid in being left over night.
But why not leave the finishing until sunset, when the lambs are
slaughtered and the breads become holy, so that the sanctification could
be carried out? There is a tradition that building the temple must not
take place in the night time; as Abayi said: We know that the building
of the temple must not be completed in the night, from \[Numb. ix. 15\]:
"And on *the day* that tabernacle," etc., hence *on the day* but not on
the night.

"*By the chorus*," etc. The rabbis taught: The orchestra of the
thanks-offering consisted of violins, fifes, trumpets on every corner as
well as on every elevated stone in Jerusalem and used to play \[Psalm
xxx. 2\]: "I will extol thee, O Lord, for thou hast lifted me," etc.,
and also \[ibid., 91\]. Some call this latter song *Negaim* (plagues)
because of verse \[ibid., 10\] in which it reads, "Nor shall any
plague," etc; others call it *Pegaim*, because of verse \[ibid., 7\]:
"There shall fall at thy side a thousand." They used to sing this song
from verse 1 to 10 inclusive, and also the whole of Chap. III. of
Psalms.

R. Jehoshua b. Levi used to say all the verses mentioned above before
going to bed. But this seems hardly credible, as he himself said
somewhere that none should cure one's self with the verses of the Torah.
The answer is that protecting and curing are two different things, and
he prohibited to say such verses over a wound. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)

"*Followed by the two thanks-offerings*," etc. Shall we assume that the
thanks-offerings follow the court, when we read \[Ne'hem. xii. 31, 32\]:
"Two thanks-offerings . . . after them walked Hosha'yah," etc.? Nay; it
means thus: They were all walking, the court being behind the offerings.
In what order were the two offerings carried? R. 'Hyye and R. Simeon b.
Rabbi differ concerning this: according to one they were one opposite
the other, while according to the other they were placed one behind the
other. According to the former opinion the one offering that was to be
sacrificed on the inner altar was brought near the wall, while according
to the latter opinion the one that

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

was near to the people of the court was sacrificed. R. Johanan, however,
said: It was left to the prophet to decide which of the offerings was to
be burnt and which to be eaten.

"*But whatever has not been constructed*," etc. It was taught: R. Huna
says: All the details were essential in the construction, while R.
Na'hman said: Whatever was not constructed with one of them, etc. R.
Huna bases his theory on the fact that the first sanctification
sanctified for the future, too, while Ezra's sanctification was but a
kind of memorial. On the other hand R. Na'hman holds that the first
sanctification was confined only to the present and Ezra sanctified for
his time although there were no Urim and Tumim. Rabba objected to R.
Na'hman from our Mishna which plainly states, "in this manner," *i.e.*,
with all the details specified there; whereupon he answered: Read there
"whatever was not constructed with one of them."

Come and hear another objection: Aba Saul said, there were two Bitzin on
the olive mountain, an upper and a lower one; the lower one was
sanctified strictly in the manner prescribed by the Mishna, while the
upper one was sanctified only by the ascendants from the exile, in the
absence of both king and Urim and Tumim. The lower one, whose
sanctification was complete, common people used to enter and consume
there their lenient holy food, but not second tithe; scholars, however,
used to consume there both. In the upper one of the incomplete
sanctification the common people used to consume the lenient holiness,
while the scholars did not partake there of anything. But why did not
they sanctify it completely? Because the complete sanctification needs a
king, etc., as prescribed by the Mishna, and such were not at that time.
But why, then, was it at all considered a part of Jerusalem? Because
being a suburb of Jerusalem it was easily accessible (hence, it is
obvious that sanctification cannot be complete unless performed in the
manner prescribed by the Mishna)? Concerning this matter the Tanaim of
the following Boraitha differ. Ismael b. josh said: To what purpose did
the rabbis enumerate all the cities surrounded by walls from the time of
Jehoshua, b. Nun? Because the ascendants of the exile being placed in
these cities, sanctified them; the first sanctification, however, was
abolished when the land ceased to be that of Israel. R. Ismael thus
holds that the first sanctification was good only for the present, but
not for the future, and this would meet with a contradiction in the
following. R. Ismael b. Josh said: Were, then, only these cities?

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Is it not written
\[Deut. vi. 4, 5\]: "Sixty cities . . . all these were fortified
cities," why, then, had the sages enumerated them? Because the
ascendants of the exile were placed in them; and not only to these
cities, but also to all cities which were, according to tradition,
surrounded with walls at the time of Jehoshua, apply all the
commandments imposed upon such cities; for the first sanctification has
sanctified them for the future also; whence it is evident that R. Ismael
contradicts himself. The answer is that one of these Boraithas was said
not by R. Ismael, but by R. Elazar b. josh, as the following Boraitha
states, it reads \[Levit. xxv. 30\]: "Lo choma," meaning literally no
wall; but according to the traditional reading it is Lo-choma, meaning
"it has a wall," *i.e.*, though it has no wall now but was walled at the
time Israel entered Palestine.

"*In the courtyard and forgot it*," etc. Whence is this deduced? Said R.
Elazar \[Numb. xix. 20\]: "Because the sanctuary of the Lord hath he
defiled," and \[ibid., 13\]: "Hath defiled the tabernacle of the Lord";
now, as there in so necessity of two verses for the inner defilement,
one should be applied to the outer one. But are, indeed, the two verses
superfluous? Are they not both needed for what we have learned in the
following Boraitha in the name of R. Elazar: Why have two verses to
mention both sanctuary and tabernacle, was not one sufficient? The
answer is: If only tabernacle were mentioned, it could be accounted for
by the fact of its being annointed with the holy oil, which was not the
case with the temple, and therefore no liability is attached to
defilement of latter, on the other hand, if only the holy temple were
mentioned, the reason would be that it was sanctified once forever,
which was not the case with the tabernacle; hence, the necessity of both
the verses? R. Elazar found difficulty to see the reason for using two
names, sanctuary and tabernacle, since elsewhere these two names arc
used synonymously; be, therefore, infers therefrom his two foregoing
conclusions. His statement, however, that the temple is called
tabernacle is correct, from \[Lev. xxv. 11\]: "And will set my
tabernacle (*mishkoni*) among you"; but where is it found that
tabernacle is called temple? In \[Exod. xxv. 8\]: And they shall make me
a sanctuary and I will dwell in it and verse 9 says: "I show thee the
pattern of the tabernacle."

"*He made a bow or was lingering*," etc. From this it may be said that
the bowing must also take a certain time. Said Rabha: This is so only
when, while bowing, he turned his face

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

to the outside, but not if to the inside of the temple; and the Mishna
is to be interpreted thus: if he made the bow toward the inside or
turned his face toward the outside for a certain interval; and here is
an illustration: Suppose he kneels only, then no time is needed; but if
he bows, *i.e.*, falls down and stretches his hands and feet, then a
certain time must be taken up. And how long is this time interval? R.
Itz'hak b. Na'hmeni, with whom was Simeon b. Pazi, according to others
*vice versa*, or Simeon b. Na'hmeni, one says, it is so long as would
take to say this verse \[II Chron. vii. 3\]: "And all the children of
Israel were looking on as the fire came down, and the glory of the Lord
was resting upon the house; and they kneeled down with their faces to
the ground upon the pavement, and prostrated themselves, and gave thanks
unto the Lord for he is good; because unto everlasting endureth his
kindness"; while the other says: Only from "they kneeled" until the end
of the verse. The rabbis taught: *Kidah* is bowing to the ground face to
the earth, as \[I Kings, i. 31\]: "Then did Bath-sheba bow," etc.;
kneeling is to stand upon the knees, as \[ibid. viii. 54\]: "From
kneeling on his knees"; finally, bowing is prostrating one's self, as
\[Gen. xxxvii. 10\]: "To bow down ourselves to thee to the earth."

"*If by the short way he is not guilty*." Rabha said: On the short way
even if he kept on going the whole day the toe of one foot touching the
heel of the other, he is free. He, however, propounded a question: If
his walk was interrupted every time, must these intervals be added and
counted or not? Now, why does not Rabha decide his question by his own
doctrine from above? Because above he treats of the case done without
interruption. Abayi asked Rabba: If he walked through the long way so
quickly, as it takes no longer than by the short way, what then? Is the
time essential and then he is free, or is the way essential and then he
is liable? He answered: The long way cannot be made shorter by
contracting the time of walking it.

R. Oshia said: I would like to say something, but am afraid of my
colleagues; if one enters a leprous house backwards, although all his
body was already in the house except his nose, he remains clean, as
\[Lev. xiv. 46\]: "And he who goeth into the house," etc., means going
in in the ordinary way, but not backwards; now, the reason of my
hesitating is that my colleagues may, on the basis of the latter
quotation, say that even when all his body, nose, too, is already in the
house he is clean.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Said Rabba: If the
whole body was in, he should not be worse than vessels In such a house,
of which it reads \[ibid. 36\] ."That all shall not be made unclean."
There is a Boraitha supporting R. Oshia: On the roofs of the temple no
holy of holy food must be consumed, no lenient holies must be
slaughtered there, and he who, while unclean, enters the temple by these
roofs is not culpable, as \[ibid. xii. 4\]: "And into the sanctuary
shall she not come" means the coming in in the ordinary way.

"*This is a positive command concerning, the holy temple*," etc. What is
the standpoint of the Tana from which he says "this is"? He refers to a
statement in the Mishna in Horioth (Mishna, I. ): There is no liability
attached to a positive and negative commandment, etc., regarding which
our Tana says. This is the positive commandment to which liability is
not attached; but where, then, is a positive command entailing
liability? It is "the having of intercourse with a woman" mentioned in
the Mishna.

It was taught: Abayi said in the name of R. Hyya b. Rabh, in this last
case the transgressor is liable to twice stripes: one for the
intercourse, and one for the separation. So also said Rabha in the name
of Samuel b. Shila, quoting R. Huna. Rabba, however, deliberating on
this point, said: Let us see how was the case; if it treats of a scholar
who had relation with his wife at the time she usually gets her menses,
then he is justly culpable for the intercourse as for an unintentional
offence, as he thought he will finish before, and for the separation,
which act is with him as a scholar an intentional one, he is not liable
to stripes (as such an act entails Korath); on the other hand, if it
treats of an ignorant, why should he be liable twice? Is this not a case
analogous to that where one consumed twice illegal fat the size of an
olive in one forgetfulness, when he is culpable only once? And should
you say that the transgressor acted so not at the usual time of
menstruation, then, if he be a scholar he is not liable at all, since
the intercourse was had innocently, while as regards separation it is
here, too, an intentional act; if, however, he be an ignorant, he is
culpable only once, *i.e.*, for the separation! Said Rabha: It treats of
a time near to the menstruation, and of him who is a scholar and is
aware that one must not have intercourse at such a time, but not that
separation is prohibited (he is culpable twice: for the intercourse,
because though aware that he must not have, he may none the less have
thought that he will finish it before the menses ensue;

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

and for the separation, the prohibition of which was unknown to him).
Rabha said further: Both the acts we find treated of in Mishnaioth;
concerning separation in our Mishna, and concerning the intercourse in
Tract Nidah, as follows; If blood be found on his shirt the two are
unclean and liable to a sin-offering.

The master says: Immediate separation entails culpability. How then
should he behave? Said R. Huna in the name of Rabh: He should support
himself on the tips of his fingers until *phallus moretur* and then
separate himself.

It was taught: R. Jonathan b. Lequnia asked his brother, R. Simeon,
where is the warning against having intercourse with a menstruant woman?
In answer he took some dry mud and threw it upon him, saying: Is it not
plainly stated in \[Lev. xviii. 19\]? Whereupon he rejoined: I mean to
ask where is the warning against separating one's self from her who gets
her menses in the time of intercourse? Said 'Hiskia, from \[ibid. xv.
24\]: "And if any man should lie with her, and the uncleanness of her
separation come upon him," etc., which means even when he separates from
her when the menses ensue during the intercourse. But again, here we
find only the positive command: "He shall be unclean seven days"
\[ibid.\]; when, then, is the negative command against separating one's
self? Said R. Papa: The above-cited verse \[ibid. xviii. 19\]: "Shalt
thou not approach (*Tikrab*)"means also thou shalt not separate thyself,
as \[Isa. lxv. 5\] uses the word *K'rab'* to mean separating, so does
there *tikrab'* mean separate.

The rabbis taught \[Lev. v. 31\]: "And ye shall separate the children of
Israel from their uncleanness," whence you derive the warning that the
children of Israel should separate themselves from their wives near the
period of menstruation; so R. Jashia. And for how long? Said Rabha: For
twelve hours. R. Johanan said in the name of R. Simeon b. Jo'hai: He who
does not separate from his wife at the said period, his children even if
equal to the sons of Aaron, will die; as after the above-cited verse and
verse 33 follows the mention of the death of Aaron's children. R. 'Hyya
b. Aha said in the name of R. Johanan: He who does separate himself for
that period will be rewarded with male children, as \[ibid. xi. 47\]:
"To distinguish between the clean and unclean," is followed by \[ibid.
xii. 2\]: "If a woman . . . and born a male child." R. Jehoshua b. Levi
added: He will be rewarded with sons who will be fit to

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

decide law questions, as it reads \[ibid. x. 10, 11\]: "So that ye maybe
able to distinguish. . . . to teach." R. Benjamin b. Japheth said in the
name of R. Elazar: He who sanctifies himself during the intercourse will
be rewarded with male children, as \[ibid. xi. 44\]: "Ye shall sanctify
yourselves," etc., which chapter is followed by verse \[ibid. xii. 2\].

"*A reptile*," etc. What is the point of their difference? Said 'Hiskia:
A reptile and a carcass; according to R. Eliezer he must exactly know
the cause of his defilement, whether reptile or carcass, while R. Aqiba
maintains that the knowledge, and not the exact cause, of his defilement
is necessary. And so also was this point explained by Ula.

The rabbis taught: "If there were two paths one of which was unclean
(but it was not certain which one), and one passed through one of them
entering, however, the temple after passing through the other path, too,
he is liable; if, however, after passing the first path he entered the
temple by forgetting and on becoming aware therof he performed the
sprinkling and took a legal bath, and then passed the other path and
again entered the sanctuary by forgetting, he is liable. R. Simeon,
however, declares him free. On the other hand, R. Simeon b. Jehudah
holds him, in the name of R. Simeon, free even in the first case." How
is this last decision to be understood? In the first case where he
passes the *two* paths there is no doubt that be passed an unclean one,
how, then, can he be free? Said Rabha: The decision concerns a case
where he, having passed both paths, forgets, enters the temple, and
thereafter recollects his passing through but one of the paths; and the
point of difference here is that the first Tana quotes R. Simeon as
holding that partial cognition is considered as the whole, which R. b.
Jehudah in his name denies. But why does the Boraitha hold liable him
who has performed sprinkling, etc.? Is not here the cognition concerning
a *doubtful* case and hence he should not be liable? Said R. Johanan:
Here the Tana regards the doubtful cognition as a certain one. Resh
Lakish, however, said: This Boraitha is in accordance with R. Ismael,
who holds that antecedent cognition is not requisite. <span
