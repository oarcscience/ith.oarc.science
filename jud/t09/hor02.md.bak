# CHAPTER II.

MISHNA *I*.: If an anointed priest has erroneously rendered an unlawful
decision against himself and acted accordingly by mistake, he must
sacrifice a bullock. But if the decision was conceived in error and the
act performed intentionally or *vice versa*, he is free; for the
decision of an anointed priest with regard to himself is equivalent to a
decision of the court for the people.

GEMARA: "*Erroneously . . . acted accordingly by mistake*," Is this not
self-evident? Said Ahaye: It speaks of a case where he forgot the reason
of his decision, and when he acted he said that he acts in accordance
with the decision, lest one say that in such a case it is considered an
intentional act, since if he remembered the reason of the decision he
would not act, it comes to teach that it is not so.

"*But if the decision . . . in error and the act performed
intentionally*," etc. Whence is this deduced? From what the rabbis
taught: it reads \[Lev. iv., 3\] "to bring guiltiness on the people,"
which seems superfluous in this connection, but comes to teach that he
\[the priest\] is equal to the congregation; a fact that could be
inferred without a special verse, *i.e.* the congregation is exempt from
the laws governing the individual, and so is the anointed priest; hence,
as the congregation is liable but for forgetting and for acting
erroneously, the same should be with the anointed priest; or, on the
other hand, a prince is exempt from the laws of an individual, and so is
an anointed priest: as the former is liable for erroneous acting without
forgetting, the same should be with the latter; it thus remains to see
to whom is he \[the priest\] equal as regards his offering: the
congregation brings a bullock, but not a pending trespass offering, and
the same does the anointed priest bring; hence, as the congregation is
liable but for forgetting and erroneous acting, so also is the anointed
priest. But why not say: As in case one acts in accordance with the
congregation's decree, he is liable, the same should be if one acts
according to the decision of the anointed priest? It reads \[ibid.\]:
"For *his* sin, and not for the sin of another." And whence is it
deduced that the anointed priest does not bring a pending

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

trespass offering? From \[ibid. v., 18\] "concerning his sin of
ignorance," which signifies: only for him whose sin and erroneous act
are considered equal (*i.e.* where both decision and acting were
performed in error), exclude the anointed priest, who is liable but for
forgetting and for erroneous acting.

MISHNA *II*.: If he (the said priest) both decided and acted for
himself, he brings his atoning sacrifice separately. If, however, he
both decided and acted jointly with the congregation, he brings with
latter a joint atoning sacrifice. Like the court, that is liable only
when it effects a decision partly annulling partly confirming the law,
so also the anointed priest, and even if the law in question be one
regarding idol worship.

GEMARA: Whence is this deduced? from what the rabbis taught: if he has
both decided and acted together with the congregation, lest one say he
is to bring a bullock separately, we infer from the case of a prince: as
a prince is exempt from the laws governing an individual and so is the
anointed priest, too, the same is the case here, viz.: as the prince is
to bring a separate offering when he sins separately, but when he sins
with the congregation he is atoned for by its offering, the same is the
case with the anointed priest; on the other hand, a prince is atoned for
together with the congregation on the day of atonement, which is not the
case with the anointed priest, and as he (priest) needs a separate
offering on the day of atonement, the same should be the case if he has
sinned together with the congregation;--against this the afore-cited
verse \[Lev. iv. 3\], which signifies that if he sins separately, he
brings a separate offering, and if he sins with the congregation he need
not bring a separate offering.

But let us see the nature of the case: if he was the presiding justice,
then only *his* decision must be taken into consideration, as the
opinion of the rest counts for nothing, and it is obvious that the
atonements must be separate; and if he was not presiding, why should he
be atoned for separately when his opinion in this case does not count?
Said R. Papa: it means that he was equal to the others.

Abaye was about to say that "he sinned separately" means: in a different
place; but Rabha said to him: does the difference in place cause the
separation? it may be even in one and the same place but concerning
different prohibitions, and then it is considered separate sinning.

"*Partly annulling*," etc. Whence is this deduced? From

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

what was said in the Chapter I: by forgetting *something* and not the
whole, and whence is it deduced that the same is the case with the
anointed priest? from what is discussed above: "To bring guiltiness on
the people." Finally, whence is deduced that the same is the case
concerning idolatry? From what the rabbis taught: lest one say that
because concerning idolatry there is a special verse, it should hence be
treated differently,--there is an analogy of expression: "From the
eyes," found in both cases (idolatry and other sins) to teach that they
are equal in all respects.

MISHNA *III*.: The conditions determining the liability of both the
courts and the anointed priest are: Their ignorance of the thing during
the rendering of the decision, and the subsequent erroneous acting. The
same conditions hold in decisions regarding idol worship.

GEMARA: Whence is this deduced? From what the rabbis taught: it reads
\[Lev. iv. 13\] "Through ignorance, and a thing be hidden," whence we
see that both ignorance and forgetting are necessary. The deduction of
the case of the anointed priest is again as above. As to idolatry, lest
one say: it was separately taught, hence it requires different
treatment, comes the analogy of expression to teach as above. Thus we
see that it does not teach concerning the anointed priest regarding
idolatry; whence it may be said that our Mishna is in accordance with
Rabbi of the following Boraitha: If the anointed priest has sinned in a
case of idolatry, according to Rabbi, he is liable for erroneous acting,
and, according to the rabbis, for forgetting; all, however, agree that
his offering must be a she-goat and that he is not under the category of
those who bring a pending trespass offering, and Rabbi's reason is from
\[Num. xv. 28\]: "And the priest shall make an atonement for the person
that hath erred"; "for the person" means the anointed priest; "that hath
erred" means the prince; "in his sinning through ignorance" means
according to Rabbi that the sinning of each of the two must be through
ignorance, while according to the rabbis this part applies only to him
who sins through ignorance, exclude the anointed priest who sins through
forgetting; and whence do they deduce that he like any other individual
must bring a she-goat? From the above-cited verse \[ibid., ibid. 27\]:
"And if *any* person sin," *i.e.*, any one: common, priest, prince, etc.

And whence is it deduced that he does not bring a pending
trespass-offering? From \[ibid. v. 18\] "for his ignorance," which

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

can not mean the priest in question who sins by forgetting. On the other
hand, according to the rabbis, it intends to exclude the anointed who
sins in any case whatsoever not by erroneous acting alone, but when such
is accompanied by forgetting.

MISHNA *IV*.: The court is not liable unless the issued decree concerns
a command the intentional and unintentional violation of which entail
*Korath* and sin-offering respectively; the same is the case with the
anointed priest. The same refers to the case of idol worship.

GEMARA: Whence is this deduced? As stated in the following Boraitha:
Rabbi said: It reads \[Levi. v. 5\]: "*Alehu*" \[ibid. xviii. 18\]:
"*Olehu*," as there it is a case of Korath and a sin-offering, the same
is the case here. And the deduction that the same applies to the
anointed priest is made as above. As to a prince, it is inferred from
the analogy of expression \[ibid. iv. 22\]: "Prohibitions" (*Mitzvoth*),
found also \[ibid. ibid. 13\] concerning the congregation; now, as the
latter treats of things the transgression of which is, if intentional
under Korath, and if unintentional under sin-offering, the same is the
case with a prince; while concerning a common individual it reads \[ib.
ibid. 27\]: "If any person" to infer this last from the previous one.

"*The same refers to the case of idol worship*." Whence is this deduced?
From what the rabbis taught: because idolatry is mentioned specially,
hence it should be treated differently, so that one be culpable even
when the sin is not under the category of Korath, etc., therefore the
analogy of expression "from his eyes," as there it is under the category
of Korath, so also here.

But this is concerning the congregation; whence do we know this with
regard to the anointed priest, prince, individual? From \[ibid. ib.
27\]: "*Any* person," *i.e.*, *any*: be he priest, prince, etc. But
again, all this is correct according to him who holds the
[analogy](errata.htm#64.md) of expression Olehu; but to the rabbis who do
not hold so, whence is this deduced? From what R. Jehoshua b. Levi
taught to his son \[Num. xv. 29, 30\]: "One law shall be for you, for
him that acteth through ignorance. But the person that doth aught with a
high hand," etc., this compares all the laws of the Torah to idolatry:
as latter is under both Korath and sin-offering, so also all other cases
of the same category. But from here you infer only an individual, a
ruler, and an anointed priest; whence do we know that the same is the
case with the congregation? Infer the first verse \[13\] from the last
\[27\]. We thus see that according to all, the cited verses \[Num. xv.
29, 30\] speak of idolatry,

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

how is it so understood? Said Rabha, according to others, R. Jehoshua b.
Levi; according to still others, Khdi: it reads \[ibid. ib. 22\]: "and
do not observe all these commandments"; now, a negative commandment that
is in importance equal to *all* other negatives is, you must say,
idolatry.

The disciples of Rabbi infer this from the same verse \[22 and 23\]
"which the Lord hath spoken unto Moses, all that the Lord hath commanded
you by the hand of Moses," and a commandment said, in the words of the
Holy One, blessed be He, and commanded again by the hand of Moses is of
idolatry; as the disciples of R. Ismael taught that the commandment "I
am the Lord; thou shalt have no other gods before me," we have heard
from the Almighty Himself; and thereafter it was commanded through Moses
in many other places.

MISHNA *V*.: The court is not liable for a decree concerning a command
or a prohibition with regard to (polluting) the sanctuary. Nor must one
bring a pending offering for a doubtful violation of the said command or
prohibition. But in case of erroneous teaching and of doubt, each
regarding a command or prohibition with reference to a woman in her
menses, a bullock and a pending offering are required respectively. The
command in the case is: Keep away from a woman in her menses. The
prohibition is: Have no sexual intercourse with her.

GEMARA: Whence is it deduced that the congregation is not liable to any
offering, while the individual is not liable to a pending offering
either? Said R. Itz'hak b. R. Dimi, it reads \[Lev. iv. 27\]: "and
become guilty" concerning a sin and pending offering, and also \[ibid.,
ibid. 13\]: "and they become guilty," which signifies: as the guiltiness
of an individual is attended with a sin offering established for all, so
also the guiltiness of the congregation is attended with such an
offering; and as the latter's offering is an established one, so also
the pending offering must be brought only for the doubt about a
transgression to which an established offering applies, but not about
that of the sanctuary to which a rich and poor offering applies.

MISHNA *VI*.: There is no liability when the decree concerns an adjuring
challenge to testify, a hastily made vow, the defilement of the temple
and its holy objects; the same is the case with the ruler, so R. Jose
the Galilean. R. Aqiba, however, says: The ruler is liable in all these
cases but the first one, for the king can neither judge nor be judged,
neither testify for others nor have others testify for him.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

GEMARA: Said Ula: What is the reason of R. Jose the Galilean? \[Lev. v.
5\] "And it shall be, if he have incurred guilt by any one of these
\[things\], that he shall confess that concerning which he hath sinned,"
which speaks of all that are treated of in the Mishna, and which
signifies that he who may be guilty for one of these may be guilty also
for the others, but who is not guilty for one of these is not so for the
others either. But perhaps the verse means that if he incur guilt even
for one of these? Therefore it must be said that the reason of R. Jose
the Galilean is the following Boraitha: R. Jeremian used to say: It
reads \[ibid., ibid. 7\], "And if his means be not sufficient," and then
\[ibid., ibid. 11\], "If he can not afford." All this speaks of persons
that can be classed as poor and rich, which is not the case with either
priest or ruler, as concerning the latter it reads \[ibid., ibid. 22\],
"of the Lord his God," which signifies him who has for his superior only
his God; and concerning the former it reads \[ibid. xxi. 10\]: "And the
priest that is highest among his brethren," meaning that he is highest
in beauty, in might, in wisdom and in wealth; and the anonymous teachers
say: whence is it deduced that if he \[priest\] is not rich his people
should make him the richest: from same verse: "that is highest among his
brethren," signifying that his brethren make him highest.

MISHNA *VII*.: As regards all commandments of the Torah, whose
intentional and unintentional violations entail respectively Korath and
sin offering, a private individual brings offers (in the latter case) a
(female) sheep or goat, the ruler, a he-goat; the high priest or the
supreme court, a bullock. In matters of idol worship the private
individual, ruler and priest bring a she-goat, while the court (that has
erroneously decided) a bullock and a he-goat, former as burnt offering,
latter as a sin offering. The [pending](errata.htm#65.md) offering (for a
doubtful malfeasance) is imposed upon the ruler and private persons, the
anointed priest and the court are free therefrom. The trespass offering
(for a sure misdeed) is imposed besides the first two also upon the high
priest, while the court is exempt therefrom. For challenging by oath to
testify, for a hastily made vow, for defiling the temple and the holy
objects thereof, the erroneously decreeing court is free; while private
individuals, the ruler, the high priest are liable; with the exception,
however, that the last one is according to R. Simeon not liable in the
said case of defilement. And what is the sacrifice they bring? A poor
and rich offering. R. Eliezar says: The ruler brings (for temple
defilement) a he-goat.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

GEMARA: There is a Boraitha: R. Simeon laid down this rule: In whatever
an individual is liable to a pending offering, the ruler is equal to
him, while the anointed priest and the court are free; on the other
hand, in whatever a trespass offering applies the ruler and the anointed
priest are equal, while the court is free, viz.: for a witness-oath, an
uttered oath and the defilement of the sanctuary and its holy objects
the ruler and the anointed are liable, and the court is free; however,
the ruler is not liable for a witness-oath and the anointed for the
defilement of the sanctuary, etc.; and in an act where a rich and poor
offering applies the ruler is equal, while the anointed and the court
are free.

Now, is not the Boraitha involved in a contradiction concerning the
liability of the ruler and the priest? Said R. Huna b. R. Jehoshua: this
presents no difficulty; as one Tana speaks of poverty, while the other,
of extreme poverty, and R. Simeon holds with R. Agiqa concerning extreme
poverty when the ruler is free from that offering, but differs with him
concerning poverty, in which case he holds the ruler, too, liable.
