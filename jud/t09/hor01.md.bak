# TRACT HORIOTH (DECISIONS).

## CHAPTER I.

MISHNA *I*.: If, after the court had decreed the transgression of one of
all the commandments prescribed in the Torah, an individual guided by
this decree acted erroneously, either simultaneously with the judges, or
after they had acted, or altogether independently, the court not having
acted yet at all, he is free, for he followed the decree of the court.
If, however, the transgressor was one of the members of the court and
knew the decree to be erroneous, or a scholar already qualified to
himself decide, he is in any of the aforementioned conditions liable (to
bring a sin offering), as he has not based his transgression upon the
decree of the court. This is the rule: Whoever relies upon his own
judgment is liable, but whoever follows the decision of the court is
free.

GEMARA: Samuel said: The court is not liable unless its decree read
thus: You are all-owed to practise so and so. R. Dimi of Nahardea,
however, said: The phrase "to practice" is not necessary, the statement
"you are allowed" being sufficient; which view was, however, objected to
by Abaye, R. Aba, and Rabima from Mishnaioth that oppose it and it was
accordingly overthrown without any further discussions.

"*An individual . . . acted erroneously*," etc. Said Rabha: This is so
only when he acted ac-cording to the decree of the court, but if he ate,
e. g., illegal fat in the belief that it was legal, he is liable. This
view of the case so certain to Rabha was doubtful to Rami b. Hama, as he
propounded the same question and Rabha answered it from the expression
"guided by this decree" (the Gemara, however, says) that in this case
Rabh R. Johanan differ, viz.: in case the court has decreed that this
fat is allowed to use and has consumed illegal fat thinking it legal,
according to the former he is free, and according to the latter he is
liable. And. R. Papa explained R. Johanan's

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

reason to be that the transgressor is still considered as having acted
in accordance with the decree, as if the court became aware that it has
erred it would retract and so would the transgressor abstain from
eating, hence R. Johanan's decision. And Rabha said: Rabh admits that
the transgressor in question does not complete the majority, because it
reads "erroneously," which means that all must err with regard to the
same thing but not to different things.

"*Either simultaneously with the judges*," etc. This is stated in order
to teach that he is free, not only when he acted simultaneously with,
but also when after, the judges had acted.

"*A scholar qualified*," etc. To what purpose are both the conditions
stated? Rabha: To teach that even such a person who is learned but who
lacks discriminating power, or *vice versa*, is also culpable. Said
Abaye to him: But from the statement of the Mishna, "who is already
qualified to decide," obviously follows that he is both learned and
strong is discrimination? Answered Rabha: I mean to say that if the
Mishna stated not the last phrase, it could be said that in order to
make him liable he must possess the two qualifications, hence the Mishna
states it to indicate that its first phrase refers to him who possesses
even but one qualification.

Again: "*Qualified himself to decide*," etc. Who is meant thereby? Said
Rabha, such, *e.g.*, as Simeon b. Azai and Simeon b. Zoma. Said Abaye to
him: An act of such great men may be considered intentional; we must,
therefore, say that such a case can take place only if he was aware that
such is prohibited, but he committed an error by thinking that it is
meritorious to follow the decree of sages even when they err.

"*This is the rule*," etc. What does this sentence intend to add? Him
who does not care at all to guide himself by the decision of the court.
Said R. Jehudah in the name of Samuel: The whole Mishna is in accordance
with R. Jehudah (the Jana), but according to the sages one is liable for
acting upon the decree of the court as his guidance. Which R. Jehudah is
this? From the following Boraitha. It reads \[Lev. iv. 27\]: "If any
person . . . sin through ignorance, by his doing," where there are three
extensions, to teach that he is liable by his doing it himself, but if
by doing it upon the decree of the court, he is free. And which sages
are there spoken of? From *Torath Kohanim*, section i., Leviticus. But
let us see, our Mishna as well as that of Torath Kohanim is each taught
anonymously;

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

hence, then, do we know that our Mishna is in accordance with R. Jehudah
and the Boraitha with the rabbis, may be the converse is the case? Nay,
as of no other have you heard to consider such extensions than of R.
Jehudah, who said in the following Boraitha: it reads \[ibid. vi. 2\]:
"This is the law of the burnt-offering," where there are three
extensions. However, the Mishna can not be in accordance with R.
Jehudah, for the reason that according to him the congregation is liable
to bring a bullock in case its majority have sinned erroneously, while
according to the sages the *court* must bring it. Therefore, our Mishna
must be interpreted to mean that the court has decreed and only the
minority has acted thereupon, and the point of their difference is that
according to one an individual acting on the basis of the court's decree
is free, while according to the other he is liable. R. Papa, however,
said: All agree that in such a case the transgressor is free, and their
point of difference is that one holds. The court is completing the
majority of the congregation, while the other does not hold so.

R. Assi said: In a decision for practising, it is not the majority of
the congregation but that of all the population that must be considered,
as \[I Kings viii, 65\], "And Solomon held at that time the feast, and
all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Chamath unto
the river of Egypt, before the Lord our God, seven days and seven days,
even fourteen days," now, as it is written, "and all Israel with him,"
what for, then, yet the description, "great assembly from the entrance
of Chamath unto the river of Egypt"? To teach that in such a decision
(as to abolish the day of atonement) the population of the whole land is
considered the assembly.

R. Jonathan said: If there were one hundred assembled to decide some
point, there is no liability (attached to the transgression of the
decision) unless the decree was made unanimously, as it reads \[Lev. iv.
13\]: "And if the whole congregation of Israel sin," which means that
all sin by error, and that the decision be brought about unanimously.
Said R. Huna b. R. Ashia: It seems to be so, since with regard to all
the laws of the Torah there is a tradition that the majority is
equivalent to the whole, and here it reads, "the whole congregation,"
*i.e.*, it must be the *whole* of the body, so that if there were one
hundred their decision must be unanimous.

An objection was raised from our Mishna which states that

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

he is liable if "he has not based his transgression upon the decree of
the court," whence it follows by implication that if another one (not so
qualified) acted thus he would be free; why so, since in this the decree
was no longer unanimous (as one of the members deviates)? It means here
that this one member has also nodded his head affirmatively (while the
vote was taken).

R. Mesharshia objected from the following: Our masters have relied upon
R. Simeon b. Gamaliel and R. Elazar b. Zadok, who have decided that no
decree must be promulgated unless the majority of the congregation is
able to comply with it; and R. Ada b. Aba said: Where is there an
allusion thereto in the Scripture? \[Mal. iii. 9\]: "With curse are ye
cursed, and yet me do ye rob, O ye entire nation." Now, here is written
the entire nation and nevertheless the majority is equivalent to the
whole; hence, R. Jonathan's view is wholly overthrown, and the
expression in the Scripture (cited above), "the whole congregation"
means: if the whole is able to comply with the decree it is considered,
but not otherwise.

MISHNA *II*.: If upon issuing the decree the court becomes aware of its
being conceived in error and retracts, and meanwhile an individual
commits a transgression upon that decree either before or after the
court succeeded to bring its atoning offering, he is free according to
R. Simeon, while R. Elazar classes it among the doubtful cases. In what
sense is it doubtful? He may have stayed at his home, then he is liable;
but if he was in the sea countries he is free. Said R. Aqiba: I agree
that in the latter case he is rather free than liable. Whereupon Ben
Azai asked: What difference is there between the two cases? It consists
in that he who stays at home can possibly hear (of the retraction),
while to the other one this is impossible.

If the court decided to annihilate a law in its very essence, by saying,
*e.g.*, that there is not in the Torah the law of menses, of Sabbath, of
idolatry, the members of the court are free (from an offering); but if
it decided to abolish only one part of a law retaining in force the
other part, they are liable. How so? If it decided, *e.g.*, that, though
the law of menses is in the Torah, a man who has sexual relations with a
woman in her watching days is free; or, that he who transports something
from private to public grounds is free though the law of Sabbath is in
the Torah; or, that the Torah truly forbids idol worship, yet he who
bows to the idol is free--the court is liable, for it reads

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

(Lev. iv. 13): "And the thing be hidden," *i.e.*, *something*, but not
the whole essence.

GEMARA: Said R. Jehudah in the name of Rabh: R. Simeon used to say that
if one acted upon a decision issued by the majority of the congregation,
he is free; because a decision discriminates between intentional and
unintentional acting, and here the transgressor, guided in his act by
the decision, sins unintentionally (though he acts intentionally), and
according to Rabh R. Simeon is consistent with his own theory elsewhere
that the bullock for the forgetting by the congregation, and the he-goat
for idolatry, are to be brought from the treasury of the temple.

There is a Boraitha. In the case mentioned in the Mishna, R. Mair makes
him liable, and R. Simeon holds him free, while R. Elazar finds this
case to be doubtful; and in the name of Symachos such was said to be a
pending case. Said R. Johanan: They differ concerning a
pending-offering. Said R. Zera: R. Elazar's decision is like that
regarding the case where one consumes fat doubtful whether it is legal
or illegal, and thereafter he became aware that it was doubtful, he is
to bring a pending offering; and not only according to him who obliges
the *congregation* to bring such an offering, as such an act is known to
every one, hence, if the transgressor has acted after the congregation
brought its atoning offering, in which case it cannot possibly be said
that he in his act guided himself by the court's decree,--but even
according to him who obliges the *court* to such an offering, which may
be not known to everybody, the transgressor is also liable, since he
could find this out upon investigating.

R. Jose b. Abin, according to others b. Zebida, likens Symachos'
decision to that regarding the case where one brings his atoning
offering at twilight, which makes the atonement doubtful, since if it
was yet day he is atoned, but if night he is not, and none the less he
is not obliged to bring another offering.

"*Ben Azai asked*," etc. Is not Ben Azai right? The difference between
them is the case when the transgressor has just set out on his journey;
according to Ben Azai he is liable, while according to R. Aqiba he is
free as soon as he starts on his way.

"*If the court decided to annihilate*," etc. Said R. Jehudah, in the
name of Samuel: The court is not liable unless it has decided

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

upon a point which the Sadducees do not admit, but where they do, it is
not considered an error, since even a child knows such a point, and the
court is accordingly free.

MISHNA *III*.: If while the court was deciding, one of its members who
perceived their error drew their attention to it, or if the presiding
judge was absent, or one of them was a proselyte, a bastard, a nation,
or an aged man who had no children, they are free; on the ground of the
following analogy \[Lev. iv. 3\]: the expression *congregation* is used
and \[Numb. xxxv. 24\] the same expression, it is inferred thus: just as
there the expression means a congregational meeting whose members are
singly and severally qualified to decide law questions, in the latter
case it means the same.

GEMARA: "*The presiding judge*," etc. Whence is this deduced? Said R.
Sheshith: It is likewise found in a Boraitha of the disciples of R.
Ismael, viz.: Why was it said that if the court decides on a point which
the Sadducees admit, it is free? Because this is not considered an error
but a fact of ignorance, as the members of the court ought to have
learned; the same is the case here where the presiding justice was
absent, some one of the members ought to substitute him, and as there
was none competent to do so they are ignorants who ought to learn.

"*The expression congregation*," etc. And whence do we know that there
they are fit to decide questions? Said R. Na'hman b. Itz'hak: It reads
\[Ex. xviii. 22\]: "With thee," *i.e.*, such as are equal to you.

MISHNA *IV*.: If the court decided in error, causing the whole people to
act erroneously, a bullock is to be offered; but if the court decided
intentionally (against the law) and the people acted in error, a sheep
or goat is to be sacrificed (by each individual transgressor). If,
however, the reverse was the case, all are free.

GEMARA: It states: If the court decided unintentionally and the people
acted intentionally, they are all free, whence it follows by implication
that if the unintentional act was equal to an intentional one, *i.e.*,
done independently of the court's decree, one is liable; and what case
would illustrate this? *E.g.*, the court decided that fat is legal and
one has consumed such in the belief that it is legal, whence could be
solved the question propounded above by Rami b. Hama? Nay, it may be
said that because in the first part it speaks of an intentional decision

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

and of subsequent unintentional act, it expresses in the last part the
reverse.

MISHNA *V*.: If upon the erroneous decree of the court the whole people,
or its majority, acted, a bullock is to be brought; or, in case the
decree referred to idol worship, a bullock and a he-goat; so holds R.
Mair, while R. Jehudah says: Twelve tribes bring 12 bullocks, and in the
case of idol worship yet 12 he-goats in addition. R. Simeon says: 13
bullocks in the one and 13 bullocks plus 13 he-goats in the other case
respectively, thus making one bullock with one he-goat to each tribe,
and one such pair for the court. If but seven tribes or the majority (of
the people) acted upon the decree, the court members must bring a
bullock, and in case of idolatry also a he-goat, so holds R. Mair, while
according to R. Jehudah, the 7 tribes that sinned should bring 7
bullocks, and the innocent remaining tribes also sacrifice one bullock
for the sinners. R. Simeon maintains his foregoing view, reducing the
number of the sacrifices from 13 to 8.

If a tribal court caused by its erroneous decision the tribe to act
accordingly, only this tribe is liable, while all the others are free,
so holds R. Jehudah; the sages, however, maintain that only those are
liable who act on the decree of the supreme court, for it reads \[Lev.
iv. 13\]: "If the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,"
hence not that of a single tribe.

GEMARA: The rabbis taught: If the court was aware that its decision was
erroneous, lest one say that it is liable, it reads \[Lev. iv. 14\]:
"The sin becometh known," but not the sinner, "through which they have
sinned," *i.e.*, if there were two tribes they bring two bullocks;
three, three bullocks, and so forth. But perhaps it means: If two
individuals have sinned, they must bring two bullocks, and if three,
three, and so on? To this it reads: "The congregation shall offer,"
*i.e.*, each congregation, as well as the congregation at large, is
liable; how so? If there were two tribes, they bring two, and if seven
tribes, they bring seven, and all other tribes who have not sinned
should also each of them bring a bullock, since, though they have not
sinned, they must conjoin themselves to the sinning tribes, as for this
purpose it reads "the congregation," to make liable each of them. So R.
Jehudah. R. Simeon, however, said: The seven tribes that have sinned
bring seven, and the court brings one bullock in addition, for, as here

congregation

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

is used and there the same term, hence, just as there the court *with*
the congregation is meant, the same is the case here. R. Mair, however,
said: If the seven tribes have sinned, the court brings only one
bullock, and *all* are free for the same reason, as congregation
mentioned above means only the court, the same is the case here. And R.
Simeon b. Elazar said, in the name of R. Mair: If six tribes have
sinned, and they formed the majority of all Israel, or seven tribes,
though not forming the majority of Israel, only one bullock must be
brought.

"*If a tribal court*," etc. The school-men propounded a question: If one
tribe has sinned, guided by the decree of the supreme court, may the
other tribes conjoin with it to bring bullocks or not? Shall we assume
that only to seven tribes conjoining takes place, but not to one, which
does not form majority, or since it acted upon the decree of the court
there is no difference whether one or seven? Come and hear: R. Jehudah
said: If one tribe has acted in accordance with *its* court, it *alone*
is liable, but if it acted according to the decision of the supreme
court, all the other tribes are also liable. Said R. Ashi:
[It](errata.htm#63.md) seems to be so also from our Mishna, which states,
"only this tribe is liable, while all the others are free"; to what
purpose does it add, "while all the others," etc., after it states "only
this tribe," etc? To teach us, thus: Only in the case of its own court,
but if it is a case of the supreme court, all the others are also
liable.

But let us see, whence do both R. Jehudah and R. Simeon deduce that
*one* tribe is also called *Kahal*, *i.e.*, congregation (of all
Israel)? From \[II Chron. xx. 5\]: "And Jehoshaphat stood forward in the
*Kahal* of Judah and Jerusalem." R. A'ha b. Jacob opposed: Perhaps there
it was *Kahal*, because the tribe Benjamin, too, was there, hence more
than one tribe? Therefore, says he, it is deduced from \[Gen. xlviii.
4\]: "And I will make of thee a *Kahal* of people"; now, at that time
Benjamin was born, and you infer from here that so said the Merciful One
to Jacob: one *Kahal* more is born to you. Said Shba to R. Kahana: But
perhaps the Merciful meant, now as Benjamin is born, and you have twelve
tribes you are called a *Kahal*? And he answered: Do you mean to say
that eleven tribes are not called *Kahal*?

The rabbis taught: If one member of the congregation dies, the liability
does not cease, but if one member of the court dies, it does cease.
According to what Tana is this Said R, 'Hisda,

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

in the name of R. Zera, in the name of R. Jeremiah, quoting Rabh: It is
in accordance with R. Mair, who said that the court and not the
congregation brings the offering; hence, if a member of the court dies,
it means one of the partners to the sin-offering died, and in such a
case the sin-offering can not be brought.

R. Joseph opposed: Why not say on the same reasoning lines that it is in
accordance with R. Simeon, who says that the court with the congregation
must bring the offering? Said Abaye to him: We have heard R. Simeon
saying elsewhere that a sin-offering of partners is not put to death: If
the bullock and he-goat of the day of atonement upon being lost were
substituted by others, and thereafter the first were found, they all are
put to death (because none of them is fit for the altar); so R. Jehudah.
R. Elazar and R. Simeon, however, maintain that they must be kept until
they become blemished, as there is a rule that a sin-offering of a
congregation is not put to death. Rejoined R. Joseph: You speak of
priests, an entirely different case, as they are themselves called
*Kahal* \[Lev. xvi. 33\]: "For all the priests and for all the people of
the *Kahal*." Answered Abaye: According to this they ought to bring a
bullock for an erroneous decision by their own court; and should you say
that such is the case, then there will be more than twelve tribes!
Thereupon said R. A'ha b. Jacob that the tribe of Levi is not called
*Kahal* at all, as from the above cited verse \[Gen.\], it is to be
understood that they who inherited landed property in Jerusalem are
called a tribe, but not the Levites, who had no such inheritance. But if
so there are fewer than twelve tribes? Said Abaye: It reads there
\[ibid.\] that Ephraim and Menashah (the two sons of Joseph) are
considered as Rubin and Simion: *i.e.*, as *two* tribes. Said Rabha:
Does it not read \[ibid., ibid. 6\]: "After the name of their brothers
shall they be called"? The answer is: They are called after the
brothers' name only in respect of inheritance, but not in other
respects. But are they not all divided into flag-division? This was only
to honor the flags, as the division of the inheritance took place in
accordance with the flag-divisions. But are they not divided according
to their respective princes? This also was done to honor the princes; as
we have learned in the following Boraitha: Solomon has celebrated seven
days the dedication of the temple; why did Moses celebrate twelve days
the tabernacle? To honor the princes.
