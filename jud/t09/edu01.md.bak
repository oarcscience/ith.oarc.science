# TRACT EDUYOTH (TESTIMONIES).

## CHAPTER I.

MISHNA *I*.: Shamai says: For all women suffices their perceiving the
menses (to make unclean whatever one of them may happen to touch; but
not before this perceiving). Hillel, however, says: The time is to be
counted between two consecutive examinations regardless of the length of
the interval and be it of many days (and all she touches at that time is
unclean). The sages, however, say: The Halakha prevails with neither
Shamai nor Hillel; but one day (night included) reduces the interval
between the said examinations; on the other hand, the moment of
examination reduces the allowance of the day (and night). (However, all
agree) that for every woman who has a regular periodic menstruation the
perceiving suffices. She who uses sheets to examine herself before and
after intercourse, reduces thereby both the time of the previous
examination and the above-said day of allowance. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

MISHNA *II*.: Shamai says: One must separate Chalah (first dough) from
one Kab; Hillel says from no less than two, while the sages set the
minimum at one and a half Kab, lowering it, however, to five-fourths of
a Kab when the measures were increased. R. Jose says: Not exactly
five-fourths, but a trifle above.

MISHNA *III*.: Hillel says: One Hin-ful of drawn water renders a legal
bath, <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) when poured therein, unfit. (A
Hin-ful is not the exact quantity, but is stated here as it is one's
duty to use the teacher's language.) Shamai says: Nine Kab, while the
sages, disagreeing with either view, uphold the two weavers that came
from the gates-of-refuse in Jerusalem and testified in the name of
Shemai and Abtalion that three Lugs of drawn

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

water render the aforesaid bath unfit, and decided that Halakha to
prevail so.

MISHNA *IV*.: Why, then, are the theories of Shamai and Hillel stated at
all, if without avail? To teach to posterity that one must not insist
upon one's statements, since the distinguished masters of the world did
not persist in their views.

MISHNA *V*.: And why is mention made of the opinion of a single person
in connection with that of many, when the final decision is invariably
with the majority? In order that when a court should happen to approve
of some one's opinion it might base its decision thereon, for no court
may annul the decision of another court, unless it be superior to latter
both in erudition and number. If, however, it be superior only in one
respect: in either erudition or number, it cannot annul; as it must be
superior in both.

MISHNA *VI*.: Said R. Jehudah: If this be the case, why is mention made
of the opinion of an individual in connection with that of the majority
to no purpose? In order that if one were to base his argument on
tradition he could be answered that his tradition is in accordance with
the opinion of that and that individual.

MISHNA *VII*.: Beth Shamai says: A quarter Kab of the bones of the dead
(defiles one in the tent) be it from two or three dead; Beth Hillel
says: A quarter Kab from one corpse, from the quarter part of the entire
structure, or of the number of bones. Shamai himself says: One bone
suffices.

MISHNA *VIII*.: Vetch terumah may, according to Beth Shamai, be soaked
and peeled in a state of cleanness, but in that of uncleanness the
cattle may be fed on it. Beth Hillel, however, hold that in the former
state it may be soaked only, while peeling and feeding may be done in
the latter. Beth Shamai says: It must be very dry when given to the
cattle; R. Aqiba holds that in a state of uncleanness all actions may be
performed on it.

MISHNA *IX*.: If one desires a sela in exchange for copper coin of the
second tithe, he must, according to Beth Shamai, exchange the whole coin
for a sela, while the Beth Hillel maintain that he may take but one
shekkel in silver and the other have in copper coin. <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2) (R. Mair says.md): One must not redeem fruit
and silver by other silver, while the sages allow it.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

MISHNA *X*.: When one exchanges a sela of second tithe in Jerusalem, he
must, according to Beth Shamai exchange the entire sela for copper coin;
Beth Hillel hold as above; the experts <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)
of the sages say: For three dinar in silver and one dinar coin. R.
Aqiba's opinion is: Three dinar in silver and of the fourth one a
quarter in coin. R. Tarfon says: Four aspers in silver. Shamai himself
says: Let him leave the sela in the store till he gradually consumes its
worth in goods.

MISHNA *XI*.: The bride's chair, when stripped of its adornments is
declared by the Beth Shamai as subject to defilement, but not so by Beth
Hillel. Former holds that even the seat alone of that chair is unclean.
Similar are the respective opinions of the Beth Shamai and the Beth
Hillel with reference to a chair put into a trough, the former declaring
in addition the chair unclean if even only made in a trough. (Will be
explained in Tract Kelim.)

MISHNA *XII*.: Following are the cases wherein the Beth Hillel have
altered their views in favor of those advanced by the Beth Shamai: The
woman who upon coming from the sea-countries asserts that her husband
died may, according to the Beth Shamai, remarry or enter a levirat
marriage; while the Beth Hillel contended: We heard this as holding good
only concerning a woman who comes from the harvest; whereupon the Beth
Shamai retorted: It is immaterial whether she comes from the harvest,
olive gathering or from a sea-country; and the expression "harvest" as
used by the sages in this matter was one of fact; thereupon the Beth
Hillel conceded. Furthermore, according to Beth Shamai such woman is
allowed to marry and to obtain her marriage contract, which latter right
the Beth Hillel denied her, whereupon the Beth Shamai argued: You allow
a possible adultery, a rigorous transgression, and prohibit a money
matter, a (lenient) misdemeanor? Whereto the B. Hillel rejoined: For we
find that the heirs of the deceased cannot enter inheritance upon her
statement alone. And Beth Shamai replied: But we are informed directly
from her marriage contract, where the husband writes: If you get married
to another one you should get what is here devised to you; thereupon the
B. Hillel conceded to them.

MISHNA *XIII*.: He who is half slave and half free <span
id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md) works,

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

according to Beth Hillel, one day for his master and one for himself.
Hereto objected the Beth Shamai: You amply provide for his master but
not for him; he has no right to marry either a slave or a free woman,
nor should he remain single, for the world has been created for
propagation, as it reads \[Isa. xlv. 18\]: "Not for naught did he create
it; to be inhabited did he form it." Accordingly, for the sake of a
better organization of the world his master is compelled to wholly free
him, and the slave writes him a note on the half of his value; and the
Beth Hillel accepted this opinion.

MISHNA *XIV*.: An earthen vessel when covered protects (against
tent-uncleanness) according to Beth Hillel all (it contains), while the
Beth Shamai holds that it protects only food, beverages and earthen
vessels. Asked Beth Hillel: Why? And they answered: Because it is
unclean in the opinion of the Amharetz, and no clean vessel is
protective; and B. Hillel's question as to why have you declared it
protective of food and beverages, they meet thus: We declare these clean
only for the Amharetz, but if you were to declare the vessel as such
clean, it would be so in general; hereupon the B. Hillel agreed.
