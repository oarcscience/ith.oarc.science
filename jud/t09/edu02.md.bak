# CHAPTER II.

MISHNA *I*.: R. 'Hanina the segan of the priests testified the following
four statements--viz.: The priests have never hesitated to burn meat
defiled in a secondary degree together with meat defiled in a primary
degree, though latter augments the uncleanness of the former; R. Aqiba
added: Nor have they ever hesitated to burn oil, that has become
unusable through a defiled one though bathed during the day, in a lamp
defiled through contact with one who touched a corpse, though the
uncleanness of the oil is thereby augmented.

MISHNA *II*.: Furthermore, he said: During all my life I have not seen a
hide (of a sacrificed animal found internally injured) brought out to
the fireplace. Said R. Aqiba: We learn therefrom that when the
first-born cattle on being stripped of its hide is found internally
injured, the priests may use its hide. The sages, however, say: "We have
not seen" is no evidence, so that the hide must be removed to the
fireplace.

MISHNA *III*.: The same R. 'Hanina testified that there was an old man
in a little village near Jerusalem, who was lending money to all the
villagers, writing himself the notes and having others to sign them;
when this case came before the sages, they declared fit proper. From
here is to infer that both woman and man may write she her divorce and
he the receipt respectively, since the validity of a divorce is effected
only by the undersigned thereon.

He finally testified that, when an (unclean) needle was found in the
flesh (of a sacrifice), the knife and the hands are clean, but the flesh
is uncle-an; but if found in the paunch everything is clean.

MISHNA *IV*.: R. Ismael propounded three things before the sages at
Iabnah in the vineyard: (*a*) a cracked egg put upon a colewort of
Terumah forms a combination except when put on like a hat; (*b*) an ear
of corn left standing in the crop with its point toward the yet unreaped
corn, belongs to the landowner provided it be capable of being cut off
with the standing corn, otherwise it belongs to the poor (*as
forgotten*); (*c*) a small garden

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

fenced with creeping vine may be sowed (with seeds) if it has enough
room, so that the vine-dresser with his basket can stand on all its
sides, but not otherwise.

Three things have been propounded in the presence of R. Ismael, and as
he did not express himself either for or against, R. Jehoshua b. Mathia
interpreted them: (*a*) One who inflicts upon one's self a sore on the
Sabbath day is guilty if he did it in order to make a permanent orifice,
but is free if his purpose was to remove the pus; (*b*) one is free for
hunting a snake on Sabbath in order to escape its bites, but is liable
if for medicinal purposes; (*c*) earthen dishes used in cities are clean
when in the tent of a corpse, but become unclean when carried by him who
is possessed of a running issue, in which latter case R. Eliezar b.
Zadok declares them also clean since their work has not yet been
completed.

MISHNA *VI*.: R. Ismael declared three things which R. Aqiba has not
agreed in: Garlick, sour grapes, and unripe corn-ears ground (on Friday)
before twilight may, according to R. Ismael, be finished after sunset,
while R. Aqiba does not allow it.

MISHNA *VII*.: Of the following three statements cited before R. Aqiba
the first two were in the name of R. Eliezar, and the third one in that
of R. Jehoshua: (*a*) A woman may go out on Sabbath in her gold
city-crown; (*b*) hunters after another's doves are unfit as witnesses;
(*c*) when a weasel with a worm in its mouth runs over the breads of
Terumah and it remains dubious as to whether or not the worm touched the
breads they are clean.

MISHNA *VIII*.: R. Aquiba has made statements, of which only the first
two found the approval of the sages: (*a*) A sandal of the lime-burners
is subject to defilement by the steps of him who has a running issue;
(*b*) the remnants of an (unclean) oven are unclean when four
hand-widths high, which height was thought before to be only three;
(*c*) a chair, from whose seat two consecutive boards have been removed
is, according to R. Aqiba only, subject to defilement.

MISHNA *IX*: He (R. Aqiba) was wont to say: The father conditions in his
son beauty, force, wealth, wisdom, longevity, and the reward to be
bestowed on (his) posterity; and herein lies the end of destiny, as it
reads \[Is. xli. 4\]: "He predetermines from the beginning of fate of
the generations to come," and though it reads \[Gen. xvi. 13\]: "They
will enslave them

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

and torture them for 400 years," yet we read further \[ibid. xvi.\]:
"The fourth generation will return again unto here."

MISHNA *X*: Furthermore, he was saying: There are five things of a
twelve months' duration--viz.: the punishment of the generation of the
flood, that of job, of the Egyptians, of Gog and Magog in time to come
\[Ezek. xxxv. 2\], and of the wicked in the infernum, for it reads
\[Isa. xv. 6\]: "It will take place (*chodesh bechodsho*) every month,"
*i.e.*, from the month he died next year the same month renewed. R.
Johanan b. Nari says (regarding the last point): It lasts only from
Passover till *Azereth*, for it reads \[ibid.\]: "From one festival to
the other."
