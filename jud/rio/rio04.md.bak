### II

### In the Forenoon

"Let all the people walk, every one in the name of his god; but as for
us we will walk in the name of the Lord our God, for ever and
ever."—[*Micah* iv, 5](../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#005.md).

And one of the scribes came, and . . . asked him, Which is the first
commandment of all? And Jesus answered him, The first of all the
commandments *is*, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one: And thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength; . . . And the second
*is* this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other
commandment greater than these.  
And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth:
for there is one God; and there is none other but He: And to love Him
with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the
soul, and with all the strength, and to love *his* neighbour as himself,
is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.—[*St. Mark* xii,
28-33](../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#028.md).

ONE would never have thought that the little village of Oberammergau
sheltered nigh unto five thousand<span class="margnote">A midnight
reverie at Oberammergau.</span> souls within its three hundred cottages,
that August night when I was its guest, so motionless it lay, in the
midnight hour, along the banks of the Ammer. Not a sound was heard save
the rushing of the rapid-coursing stream and the occasional rumblings of
rolling rocks in the mountains above. Long I sat at the open window,
peering out into the

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

night,—thinking, querying, prophesying. I was in a Biblical frame of
mind. Saul-like, I had strayed among the prophets, and their spirit was
upon me. All evening long I had mingled with Scriptural characters; had
heard men and women addressed or spoken of, not by their given names,
but by the names of the characters they enacted in the Passion
Play—here, Peter, John, Nicodemus; there, Caiaphas, Lazarus, Nathanael;
yonder, Mary, Martha, Magdalene. I seemed to breathe the very air of .
Palestine; to have walked the very streets of Jerusalem; to have held
converse with ancient-day dreamers and enthusiasts, one of whom I was to
see, the following day, nailed to the cross, a martyr and a God.

What that scene would look like I had no difficulty to guess. I had
encountered representations<span class="margnote">Induced by the
omnipresence of the cross.</span> of it, pictured or sculptured, or
reminders of it in the form of the plain cross, wherever I had turned
that day. Long before I had even reached the town, I had caught sight of
a gigantic cross on the towering Kofelberg, penetrating the very clouds,
reaching into the very heavens, and glistening in the golden radiance of
the noon-tide sun. And the very last thing I caught sight of before
sinking to rest that night was a crucifix over my bed. The very
mountains and the clouds overspreading

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

them seemed to assume cruciform shapes, and, strangest of all, even the
animal on the pasture seemed to carry the emblem on its back. The
*Passion's Esel*, the little colt that carried the Christ of the Passion
Play, could be seen any day pastured with exceeding care, and treated
with great consideration, because nature had distinctly traced upon its
back the sign of the cross.

Peering into the night, I sought for the gigantic cross on the summit of
the Kofelberg, which had extended so radiant a greeting<span
class="margnote">Towering cross on the Kofelberg concealed by
clouds.</span> to me ere yet I had reached the town I found it not. Dark
and heavy clouds concealed it from sight. Late that afternoon i had
already surprised me by its change from dazzling gold to a leaden hue.
(I learned later that its change of color was due to its being covered
with tin, the metal reflecting differently at different times, in
accordance with the different lights that fell upon it.)

Golden first, leaden later, clouded last! Had I beheld a symbol of the
fate of the Cross? Had I read, in nature's language,<span
class="margnote">Was it a prophecy of the clouding of the Cross?</span>
the story of the Cross's past and present, and the prophecy of its
future? Was thus to fare the story of God's Virgin-begotten Son having
come down on earth, from somewhere out of the sky, to die a voluntary
death upon the cross, for the sake of human kind—a story that flashed
out glitteringly and far, when

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

the Church was in the noon-tide of her power, but which, since the
Reformation, has worn a leaden hue, and which, in these days of critical
research and scientific inquiry, has with very many, even of the
Christian fold, become so clouded as to have passed beyond the confines
of belief? Was the exclamation: "*The cross is not visible from
Concord!*" that arose because the belief in the *supernatural* birth and
*miraculous* deeds of Christ had been repudiated by the transcendental
philosophers who met in the town of Concord, under the master-spirit of
Emerson—was that exclamation to resound also at the banks of the Ammer?
Was the invisibility, on that night, of the gigantic cross of the
Kofelberg, a prophecy that a time was coming when, with respect to *the
supernatural Christ*, the teaching even there will be: "*The cross is
not visible from Oberammergau*"*?*

If that time is coming, continued I musing, what effect will the
disbelief in a *supernatural*<span class="margnote">Elimination of
Supernatural Christ will not affect some people's faith.</span> *Christ*
have upon those who hitherto have had implicit faith in him? I thought
of the tens of thousands of Unitarians, who have discarded that belief,
and who morally and intellectually are certainly none the worse for
paying homage to Jesus the man, instead of worshipping Christ the God. I
thought of the Jews, who have preceded the Unitarians by tens of
centuries in obeying the

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sinaic
Commandments that forbid having any other God besides Jehovah, or taking
God's name in vain, or making any image for the purpose of bowing down
to it in worship, and who, morally and spiritually and intellectually,
are certainly not behind those who pay to Christ an homage that belongs
to God alone. I thought of the thousands of students in high schools and
universities who are becoming more and more lost, not only to
Christianity, but to all religious influences, because asked to believe
what critical reason pronounces irrational, what logical mind refuses to
accept. Why then should fears be entertained of evil results following a
repudiation of a pagan-borrowed dogma of the early Church?

But I also thought of the millions who are happy in that belief, and who
are good because of it. And I asked myself: Have we<span
class="margnote">But would deprive others of their religious stay and
happiness.</span> a right to deprive them of their happiness, to rob
them of the source of their goodness, by clouding their childlike faith?
Has not that faith been a bridge that has enabled many a straying and
erring one to pass from misery and sin and despair to penance and
righteousness and hope? Had I not myself observed, in my mingling with
these Oberammergauans, that what made these humble peasants so devout
and sweet was largely due to their implicit faith, that what they
believed

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

and enacted was truth, and all truth? And would it not be cruel, even
but faintly to hint to them that their *supernatural Christ* is a
mythological fiction and not an historical fact?

And so I concluded my midnight musing with the thought that, in a
theological difference<span class="margnote">Best course for each to
follow his own God.</span> as fundamental as this, the prophet Micah's
advice was probably the best: Let other people walk, each in the name of
his god; but, as for us, let us continue to walk in the name of the One
God, for ever and ever.

But also at this conclusion did I arrive, that while people are free to
believe whatever<span class="margnote">But must not be done at expense
of another's honor.</span> they choose, that freedom does not s include
the privilege of building up their faith at the expense of another
people's honor; that while Christians have a perfect right to ascribe to
Jesus whatever miracles and supernatural happenings they please, they
have no right to do this at the cost of falsifications of Jewish
history, of mistranslations of Jewish Scriptures, of misinterpretations
of Jewish laws and institutions; that while it would be wrong for us
even in the slightest degree to interfere with the Christian belief, or
to cast the slightest aspersion upon it, it is not only our right, it is
our duty, to defend ourselves from calumnies that have been heaped upon
us, in the name of *the Supernatural Christ*.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

Too long have we suffered because of such calumnies; it is time for us
to tell our story, and it is time for the Christian to hear<span
class="margnote">Jews have too long suffered from such a wrong.</span>
that story told. I have no desire to win any one from Christianity, but
I have the strongest desire to wean Christians from injustice. I have no
wish to make other feet travel my people's road, but it is my resolve to
keep others’ hands off my people's throat. I may praise as highly as any
one the Christian's preachment of turning the other cheek to the smiter,
but I do object to the Christian's continuing to smite my people, and
for no cause at all. I will yield to none in recognizing the civilizing
influence of the man of Nazareth; I am ready to bestow on him as high a
tribute as any one has yet bestowed; if I cannot say that it was he who
made Divinity human, I am ready to rank him among the foremost of those
who have made humanity divine. With all this recognition and admiration,
I am not ready to see him elevated at the cost of my people's honor, to
see him turned into a God at the cost of my people being turned into
demons, to see him made a suffering Christian deity at the cost of my
people being made to suffer the hatreds and insults of the Christian
world.

It is of this wrong done to my people in the Passion Play, or rather in
the Gospels of

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

the New Testament, of which the Passion<span class="margnote">This wrong
reenacted in the Passion Play.</span> Play is but an elaboration, that I
shall speak to you. And whenever, in speaking of it, I touch upon Jesus,
I beg of you to remember that, as George Eliot kept before her a copy of
Thorwaldsen's Christ, when translating Strauss’ "Life of Jesus," so
that, when tearing to shreds the myths and falsities spun into the life
of the real Jesus, she might, by occasionally looking into the kindly
face of *Jesus, the man*, keep herself from writing too harshly of
*Christ, the God*, even so have I before me, when speaking of Jesus, the
kindly yet suffering face of the grievously wronged Nazarene Jew, who,
far from having wished to separate himself from his monotheistic people
and found a trinitarian faith, gave, when asked for a statement of the
chief commandments, the answer the Jew has given from the first, and
gives to this day: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is One. And Him
shalt thou love with all thy heart and soul and might. And thy brother
shalt thou love as thyself."

To this Jesus let us now turn, and follow his tragic fate from his
triumphal entry into <span class="margnote">Magnificent scene of
Christ's entry into Jerusalem.</span>Jerusalem to his lamentable death
upon the cross. It was a magnificent scene, one of the most memorable of
the Passion Play, that which represented a throng of hundreds of people
variously and picturesquely attired,

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

as a promiscuous Oriental crowd, gathered all the way from northern
Galilee to the southern capital, would naturally have been, singing
hosannahs to Jesus’ first public appearance in Jerusalem, accompanying
him in joyous yet solemn procession to the Temple mount, throwing
palm-branches along his way, and acclaiming him "Royal Son of the Royal
House of David!" "King of the Jews!"

It was a scene that could not be beheld without a mingled feeling of awe
and sorrow. Its picturesqueness could not be surpassed.<span
class="margnote">The awe the impersonator of Christ casts upon the
people.</span> It clearly showed the work of nine years of rehearsal, of
nearly three centuries of stage tradition, and of every-day orthodox
faith. The love and reverence displayed by the throng of people toward
their hero was not the love and reverence of a play,—it was real and
intense. Accustomed as they are to kneel to the lifeless image of
Christ, what wonder that, when in the presence of the living
impersonator of Christ, the breathing, speaking, acting image that
tradition and art have pictured him to have been,—what wonder that they
should forget that it was but before one of their own, their
fellow-peasant, the village potter, they bowed in worship, and, under
the influence of their ecstasy, believe that the divine afflatus had
been showered upon him, by Christ Himself,

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

because of his enacting His passions on earth, for the sanctification of
man! What wonder that the people should have almost instinctively fallen
back, and opened the way to the Christ-representing Anton Lang, as he
entered a room or passed in the street! What wonder that the children
should have awaited his coming at the door of the stage, at the end of
each performance, and accompanied him, in a sort of triumphal
procession, to his home! Hero-worshippers as we all are, it is but a
small step for these humble, pious people to pass from kneeling before a
Christ-image of wood and stone to worshipping an impersonator of Christ
of throbbing flesh and pulsating heart and blessing hand and godly
speech.

And this Anton Lang, in looks and bearing, gave every manifestation that
he believed <span class="margnote">The impersonator of Christ
described.</span>himself *the Christ*, while impersonating him. I was
told that in the early morn of the day on which the first performance of
the last Passion Play decennial was given, in which he was to
impersonate for the first time the part of *Christus*, he presented
himself in the village church for mass, and bore himself while there,
and when he walked away, as if in an ecstatic trance, so profoundly
impressed and stirred was he by the part he was about to assume. Great
things are related of the impersonation of this part by

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

his predecessor, Josef Mayr,—and great things had been expected of Peter
Rendl, last year's impersonator of St. John, who, as son-in-law of Josef
Mayr, had been trained for the leading rôle, but who was prevented from
enacting it by reason of being unable to raise a beard,—the traditions
of the village preventing any character from being in any way "made up."
But I doubt whether a better *Christus* could have been found than in
this Anton Lang, and who, being but twenty-five years of age, gives
promise of still better impersonations in the decennials to come. Tall
and graceful; with long, blond, flowing locks; large, fair eyes; an
open, manly countenance; delicately moulded features; a kindly, yet
earnest look; majestic, as he sat upon the colt, led by St. John and
surrounded by his disciples, benignly dispensing his blessings upon the
people to the right and left with graceful waves of the hand,—it was a
presence as august as it was entrancing.

If fault was to be found with his appearance at all, it was in its being
a little too Teutonic and not enough Jewish. There<span
class="margnote">Only fault in his being more Teutonic than
Jewish.</span> were wanting in his countenance those deep lines of
suffering which two thousand years of persecution, because of the
proclamation of the One God, and the adherence to God's Law, had stamped
upon the Jew's face, more

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

especially in the days of the Roman's tyranny, at the time of Christ.

But much more serious fault was to be found with what ensued. The awe,
which <span class="margnote">But more fault to be found with crowd's
acclamation of him as "King of the Jews!"</span>had thus far pervaded
me, changed into sorrow the moment I caught the words of the crowd's
exultant acclamation: "Hosannah to the Son of David! Hail to the King of
the Jews!" The moment the ear caught the sound of these words, the eye
had a distinct vision of a Roman cross with a deluded Jewish martyr upon
it, and over his head the Roman initials I. N. R. I. of the words IESUS
NAZARENUS REX IUDAEORUM, the words meaning "*Jesus of Nazareth, King of
the Jews*."

It was a wild shout, that of "Son of David," and must have been an
unpleasant <span class="margnote">The need of the hour was father to the
shout.</span>shout in the ears of Jesus, for none knew better than he
that he was of humble Nazarene birth in northern Galilee, and that his
cradle had stood far from the royal city of Bethlehem in the south,
whither popular belief had looked for the rise of the emancipator of
Israel from the insufferable oppression of the Roman.

Wild as was that shout, the poor, deluded people were probably to be
pitied more than to be blamed. The wish was father to the shout. Here
was a man whose wondrous preaching and healing and magnetic power and
spiritual grandeur they had heard and

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

seen and felt, or of which they had heard wondrous reports. And there
was the Roman, crushing the tributary nation of Palestine under his iron
heel, ruling the people with a pitiless hand, subjecting them to
cruelest insults and humiliations, outraging not only their national
honor but even their religious laws and institutions. What could have
been more natural than the question:

Why may not that wicked Roman be crushed by this godly man?" "Why may
not the expected Saviour of the Davidian House be this man of wondrous
powers?"—powers easily exaggerated, and royal ancestry easily confirmed,
among an excited and credulous populace in exciting and credulous times.
Why may not he be the chosen of God to rid the capital and the nation of
the heathen and the stranger, and inaugurate the reign of justice and
peace forever more?"

It was a beautiful dream, a pardonable hope. And one can readily see how
easy it was for a crowd of such a heterogeneous<span
class="margnote">But made in the worst time and place.</span> and
inflammable nature to pass from the shout of "Hail to the Son of David!"
to the acclamation of "Hail to the King of the Jews!" But, alas, it was
a shout and acclamation in the worst possible place, and at the worst
possible time, and in the hearing of the worst possible of all men in
Palestine,

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pontius Pilate,
the Roman Procurator of Judea. Nowhere in all Palestine, from Dan to
Beersheba, could such an acclamation have sounded more treasonable than
in the streets of Jerusalem, at that time, a few days before the Paschal
festival, which, in obedience to the requirement of the Mosaic Law,
gathered into the capital of the nation all the able-bodied adult male
Israelites from far and near, and at which festival—the Egyptian
redemption having taken place on the Passover—it was popularly believed
that the Roman and final emancipation would likewise take place.

Pilate's eyes and ears, always wide open, were never more so than during
these days, <span class="margnote">Pilate's cruel hand had silenced such
outbursts before.</span>when he distributed his armed guards in such
civilian dress among the people, to keep a sharp watch on the doings and
sayings of the pilgrims, and on none more keenly than on the Galileans,
who had proven themselves the most seditious of them all, a few of whose
proclaimed or self-proclaiming Messiahs he had already summarily dealt
with on the cross, and whose followers’ ardor he had believed he had
cooled with the edge of the sword.

But all his cruelty, far from intimidating <span class="margnote">But
people's yearning for political redemption and redeemer
continued.</span>the people, had only made them all the more seditious.
The whole nation was feverish with excitement; many of them hysterical

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

from fear and alarm, and subject to the wildest hallucinations; many
thirsting for revenge, because of past and present sufferings; all
throbbing with ill-suppressed wrath against the Roman, and longing and
praying for redemption and for the redeemer. The Messianic hope, nursed
and tended for seven or eight centuries, burst into an intoxicating,
almost deranging, bloom. Awake or asleep, they were haunted by the
wildest visions of the long-awaited about to come, of the long-dreamed
glory about to burst in celestial splendor upon the House of Israel. All
was in readiness,—the time was ready; the people were ready; the throne
was ready; it wanted but the King, the Messiah, the Deliverer and
Saviour, and the accursed rule of the Roman would be at an end, and the
reign of the Messiah would begin, to endure forever.

And of all who had preceded him in the claim of the Messiahship,
probably none had a stronger conviction that he was the divinely<span
class="margnote">Jesus deluded into belief that he was the looked-for
redeemer of his people.</span> commissioned to re-establish the kingdom
of Israel than this Jesus, the carpenter's son of the Galilean town of
Nazareth. His marvelous power over his followers had probably deluded
them into that belief, and their delusion had deluded him. Long had he
fought that delusion,—as may be seen from the deep concern displayed by
him early in his public career in having all exclamations, rumors

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

and reports of his Messiahship suppressed; patients, friends, even his
disciple Peter, all are carefully enjoined "not to tell any man
anything" of his being the Christ. But it was an age of delusions, and
he was conquered by them at last. What may have started as a mere hope,
as a fond dream, became a belief, a dogma, the nearer they approached
from the northern interior country to the southern capital of the
nation. Rolled on by a mighty wave of credulity, in that dangerously
credulous era, there was no longer any stopping till they had dashed
against the rocks and had spread destruction wide. It needed but his
triumphal entry into Jerusalem, was probably their belief, for God to
make known His anointed unto all the nation, and to seat him as the
Messiah upon the vacant throne of David, and to inaugurate, by his hand
and spirit, the redemption of Israel.

But what had seemed so real and so natural in the interior country,
assumed a different <span class="margnote">But the capital shared not
his delusion.</span>aspect once they were within the walls of Jerusalem.
Their shout of "Hail to the King of the Jews!" was loud, yet the answer
was but the echo of their shouting. The fire that well-nigh consumed
them failed to kindle others. The capital was cold, freezing cold, and
silent as cold, a silence that was painfully ominous. In vain these
dreamers and enthusiasts

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

strained their ears, and peered into the skies,—no Gabriel's trumpet
announced the advent of the Anointed One; no Heavenly Messenger appeared
to present an oriflamme to the Divinely Chosen Leader; no thunders and
no lightnings, no luminous stars and no showers of meteors, welcomed the
Long-Awaited One. Burning with the ardor and patriotism of the northern
interior country, and ignorant of the preparedness and watchfulness and
strength of the Roman, they were amazed at the irresponsiveness of the
capital. They had expected Jerusalem eagerly awaiting their shout,
instantly to take up its refrain, and sweep the nation with it, and
sweep the country free of the cruel heathen,—which might have happened,
if, instead of a country-band of unarmed, barefooted fishermen and
peasants and artisans, with a gentle, peaceful preacher and healer as
their leader, a warrior of the David or the Maccabee type had come with
an army of soldiers behind him to inaugurate the era of redemption; as
really did happen, a century later, when the valiant warrior, Bar
Cochba, entered upon his ill-fated rebellion against Rome, with hundreds
of thousands of armed men behind him, and with some of the foremost
leaders of Israel for his chief supporters.

But this band of well-meaning, yet deluded country enthusiasts awakened
no such confidence

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

among the leaders of the people. <span class="margnote">The capital knew
the fatal consequences of treasonable acclamation as king.</span>While
outwardly turning a deaf ear to their acclamations, inwardly they
probably trembled at the fate awaiting the deluded leader and many
another innocent one. Higher yet than the shout, "Hail to the King of
the Jews!" they heard the cruel Pilate's command to the chief of his
guard, as they had heard it before: "Seize the traitor! Stretch him upon
the cross! Disperse the crowd with the edge of the sword! Let it be
performed rigorously and speedily, before the advent of the Passover,
before the city teems with pilgrims!" A cruel command, yet a natural
one, in those cruel days, and in a tributary, seditious country, by a
foreign governor, who ruled in mighty Cæsar's stead, with absolute power
over life and death, and one very cruel and very unscrupulous besides.
We Americans are certainly not as cruel as were the ancient Romans, and
yet, would our chief military representative treat any leader
differently who were to make a like entry into the city of Manila, and
be in like manner acclaimed "King of the Filipinos "? Neither is Lord
Kitchener as cruel as was Pontius Pilate, and yet would he treat
differently any Boerish leader who would make a like entry into
Pretoria, and in like manner be there acclaimed "President of the
Boers"?

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

From what followed may be clearly inferred that the irresponsiveness of
the capital sobered Jesus, opened his eyes wide to the<span
class="margnote">Recognized at last and prepared for by disillusioned
Jesus.</span> fatal mistake he had made. What he had never realized in
the country, amid the swarm of his zealous followers, he saw clearly now
in the capital of the nation. The delusions—which are so wont to
overcome intensely religious and visionary characters who are otherwise
profoundly intellectual, which made Martin Luther see devils and shy
inkwells at them, which made Savanarola believe that he could pass
unscathed through fire, which made Sir Matthew Hale hang innocent women
as witches,—the delusions loosened their hold on Jesus, and gave way to
his old-time clear and sound judgment. Clearly he saw that he had played
the foremost part in a public act of treason; he saw the fate that
awaited him, and yet clearer he saw his immediate duty. There was no
escape for him from the Roman cross,—but he might save his disciples, he
might save his followers. They had deluded him, but it was he who had
been the cause of their delusion and deluding. He must speedily retreat
from Jerusalem, give them his last message and the signal for their
flight and dispersion. And then he must surrender himself to the Roman,
so that, by his voluntary surrender and subsequent death, his disciples
and followers,

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

they who had so intensely believed in him, might be saved from the
Roman's sword of vengeance.

But not so is the truth told in the Passion Play, nor in the New
Testament, whence <span class="margnote">This historic fact blurred by
falsifications against Jews.</span>the Passion Play of Oberammergau
derives its text and theme. There is introduced, and realistically
enacted, a mass of falsehoods, of base inventions against the Jews, that
obviously never happened, never could have happened, that are flagrantly
self-contradictory, that violently outrage the history and law and
religion and constitution of the Jew, that had their origin, and that
were forced into the gospel stories, at the time when early Christianity
had established itself and had become polemical and vindictive, when the
theological differences between the monotheistic Jew and the trinitarian
Christian had become intense, when the Roman empire was recognized as
the most fertile field for the propagation of the new faith, and when,
therefore, on the theory that "the end justifies the means," it was
deemed politic not only to mingle Pagan myths with Jewish history, blend
Grecian gods with a Jewish martyr, but also exculpate the Roman from
having crucified Jesus, and lay the guilt upon the Roman-conquered,
Roman-persecuted, Roman-despised Jew.

But of this incrimination of the Jew and

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

exculpation of the Roman, of this blackening <span
class="margnote">Which will be analyzed in our next discourse.</span>of
the Sanhedrin and whitewashing of Pontius Pilate, which follows in the
Passion Play close upon Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem, I must speak in my
next discourse. I had thought to cover to-day the part enacted in the
Passion Play during the forenoon. But I find I had misjudged the time.
It takes much time to exonerate a character, which to blacken, a few
brief hours, a few brief words, may suffice. I shall be obliged to
devote another discourse to the remainder of the part that was enacted
in the forenoon. But what is one more hour, what are a dozen more hours
devoted to the vindication of our name, compared with the eighteen
centuries that have been devoted to the branding of it? It will take
more than another hour, more than months and years, probably centuries,
before our character will be cleared of the heinous accusations that
have been heaped upon it. Yet cleared it will be. The Jew, who has
outlived all, will yet live to see the hour of his full and final
vindication. God rules—and Justice will be done.
