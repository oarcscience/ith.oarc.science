What of the Old Testament Prophecies of Christ?

<span id="img_15500"></span> ![Decorative Header: What of the Old
Testament Prophecies of Christ?](img/15500.jpg.md)

"Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake,
Come and let us go to the seer; for he that is now called a Prophet was
beforetime called a seer."—[1 Samuel IX,
9](../../bib/kjv/sa1009.htm#009.md).

"And Moses said unto him, Art thou zealous for my sake? Would to God
that all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put
his spirit upon them!"—[Numbers XI, 29](../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#029.md).

"Before me there was no God formed, and after me there will be none. I,
I am the Lord, and beside me there is no saviour."—[Isaiah XLIII,
10-11](../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#010.md).

"I am Jehovah. . . I will not give my glory to any other nor my praise
to graven images."—[Isaiah XLII, 8](../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008.md).

"Search the Scriptures."—[St. John v, 39](../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#039.md).

"Where are the signs fulfilled whereby all men  
 Should know the Christ? Where is the wide-winged peace?  
 Shielding the Lamb within the Lion's den?  
 The freedom broadening with the wars that cease?  
 Do foes clasp hands in brotherhood again?"  
                       —EMMA LAZARUS, *An Epistle*, XXV.

IT scarcely needed the word *peace* under the beautiful medallion over
the entrance of this House of Worship. The master-hand of Ezekiel, the
sculptor, has written it<span class="margnote">An emblem of peace made a
cause of war.</span> on every figure there portrayed, and the
master-mind of Isaiah, the prophet, has stamped it upon every lineament
of that peaceful group of lion and lamb lying side by side, and of
little child toying unharmed with the asp. Upon mature reflection,
however,

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

we perceive that there was a good reason for hewing the word peace, in
bold and legible letters, under this emblem of the white-winged daughter
of God. The letters, aided by the sculptor, may possibly prevent a
further misapprehension of the prophet's words. For, though meant to
convey lessons of peace, they have hitherto been the cause of little
else than discord; though uttered to imbue the hearts of men with love
for their fellow men, they have filled them instead with cruel hatred;
though set up as a goal of man's striving after universal peace, man
increased the distance between it and himself by making this picture of
the prophet the cause of one of the bitterest strifes that has ever
separated two peoples. One people saw in this picture the foreshadowing
of a Messianic Age that some day is to dawn; the other people saw
therein a prophecy of the very labors wrought, and the very blessings
inaugurated, by the Messiah who had come.

It needs not my telling which of these two peoples believed that the
Messiah had come, <span class="margnote">Messianic prophecies
differently interpreted by Christian and Jew.</span>and which believed
that the Messianic Age had not yet dawned; which believed that universal
peace, as pictured in the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, came with the
Messiah, and which believed that it is still far distant,

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

and is still to be striven for; which of the two persecuted, and which
suffered persecution because of its inability to believe in a Saviour
who had not saved, in a Redeemer who had not redeemed, in a Messenger of
Peace and Good Will, who had innocently become the cause of more
suffering than it had ever experienced prior to his coming.

It is true the Jews rejected the Messiah-ship claimed for the Nazarene
Rabbi, but not for the reason generally assigned by Christians. It was
not blindness that prevented their seeing the "Light of the World," it
was their clear-sightedness that rendered it impossible for them to
regard the Galilean teacher in any other light than that of a pious
Rabbi, than that of a noble patriot and martyr.

It was not a lack of faith that made them spurn the "Son of God," it was
their abundant faith in their monotheism that forbade them to believe
in, and to pay reverence to, any other but the God Jehovah. It was not
ignorance that prevented their seeing in the life and deeds of Jesus the
fulfilment of the prophets' predictions, it was their scholarly
acquaintance with the Scriptures, their intimate knowledge of the genius
of their language, of the idiom and style and poetic flights and
figurative rhapsodies of their bards and prophets, that made them
interpret Old Testament passages differently from the New

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Testament writers
of the early centuries of our present era. The latter's knowledge of the
Hebrew Scriptures was either derived from faulty Greek translations or
from Gentile missionaries, who had a very imperfect or a very perverted
knowledge of the Hebrew tongue and of Jewish history and institutions.

This defense of the Jew is liable to a serious charge. It casts a doubt
upon the <span class="margnote">Let the Scriptures
decide.</span>scholarship of the founders of Christianity. We find
ourselves in a peculiar dilemma. A defense of the Christian involves an
attack on the Jew. A defense of the Jew involves an attack on the
Christian. Our love for our cause makes us eager to see our name cleared
of a false accusation. Our love of justice makes it a sacred duty not to
say or do aught that might reflect discredit on the name and faith of
the Christian.

There is but one way out of the difficulty, and that is to let the
Scriptures speak for themselves, to analyze the so-called Old Testament
Messianic predictions of Christ, to investigate the history of the
times, the state of society, and the modes of thought, during the
periods in which their authors wrote or spoke, and then, in the light of
the result of these researches, examine the Messiahship claimed for
Jesus.

Since there is quite a number of such so-called

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Messianic
predictions in the Old Testament, and since our time is limited, we can
devote ourselves to an analysis of but a few. We shall therefore take
up, first of all, the generally claimed richest source of
Christology—the prophet Isaiah. We shall investigate a few of his
strongest Messianic predictions to see whether he speaks of things that
had happened or were happening, or were about to happen in his own time,
or whether he predicts a state of affairs to be fulfilled, about eight
hundred years later, in the days of Jesus’ sojourn on earth.

We turn to the *King James Version* of the Book of Isaiah, and from
among the chapters indicated by their headings as foretelling the coming
of Christ we select the following:

I.—[ISAIAH 7: 14-16](../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md). . . . 14. Behold, a
virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.
15. Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil,
and choose the good. 16. For before the child shall know to refuse the
evil, and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be
forsaken of both her kings.

II.—[ISAIAH 9: 6, 7](../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006.md). 6. For unto us a
child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon
his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The
mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. 7. Of the
increase of *his* government and peace *there shall be* no end, upon the
throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it
with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal
of the LORD of hosts will perform this.

III.—[ISAIAH 11: 1-9](../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md). 1. And there shall
come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out
of his roots. 2. And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the
spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the
spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD. 3. And shall make him
of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing
of his ears. 4. But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and
reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the
earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall
he slay the wicked. 5. And righteousness shall be the girdle of his
loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. 6. The wolf also shall
dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and
the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child
shall lead them. 7. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young
ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
8. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the
weaned child shall put his hand on the cocatrice's den. 9. They shall
not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be
full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.

IV.—[ISAIAH 42: 1-7](../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md). I. Behold my
servant, whom I uphold, mine elect, *in whom* my soul delighteth; I have
put my Spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.
2. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the
street. 3. A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall
he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. 4. He shall not
fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the
isles shall wait for his law. 5. Thus saith God the LORD, he that
created the heavens and stretched them out; he that spread forth the
earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the
people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. 6. I the LORD have
called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep
thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the
Gentiles. 7. To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the
prison, *and* them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.

V.—[ISAIAH 53: 1-12](../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md). 1. who hath believed
our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed? 2. For he shall
grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground:
he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, *there is* no
beauty that we should desire him. 3. He is despised and rejected of men;
a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were *our*
faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. 4. Surely he
has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him
stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 5. But he *was* wounded for our
transgressions, *he was* bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of
our peace *was* upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. 6. All we
like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;
and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. 7. He was
oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is
brought as a lamb to

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth
not his mouth. 8. He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who
shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the
living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. 9. And he
made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because
he had done no violence, neither *was any* deceit in his mouth. 10. Yet
it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief; when thou
shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see *his* seed, and he
shall prolong *his* days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in
his hand. 11. He shall see of the travail of his soul, *and* shall be
satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for
he shall bear their iniquities. 12. Therefore will I divide him *a
portion* with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;
because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and was numbered with
the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession
for the transgressors.

You are puzzled at the striking applicableness of these texts to the
life of Jesus, as portrayed in the gospels. You wonder<span
class="margnote">Remarkable resemblance between Isaiah and
gospels.</span> whether they are not really prophecies, which found
their fulfilment, several hundred years later, in the Nazarene preacher.
You wonder also how, in the face of such remarkable utterances, the
Jews, as a body, could refuse, and can still refuse, to accept him for
their Messiah to whom the foretold signs and characteristics apply so
faithfully.

There is good reason for such surprise and for such thoughts. The
Messiah of the Evangelists certainly answers in many<span
class="margnote">Resemblance invites examination.</span> respells the
language of Isaiah. But enter with me into an inquiry as to when the
cited texts were written, and by whom, and with what end in view, into
an investigation as to the kind of Messiah the Jews expected, and

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

as to what they understood under the terms *prophet* and *prophecy*, and
the words of Isaiah will lose much of their mystery, and you will see
the reason for the Jews’ rejection of Jesus as their Messiah.

At the very outset, we must bear in mind that at the time of Isaiah the
terms *prophet* <span class="margnote">True meaning of the word
*Prophet* given.</span>and *prophecy* and *prophesying* had a different
meaning from what they have since acquired. Etymologically, the verb in
Hebrew simply means *to bubble, to pour forth, to utter fluent speech*,
and, hence, the noun designates the *speaker*, the *preacher*, the
*pleader*, the *interpreter*, the *counselor*, the *admonisher*, the
*poet*, the *rhapsodist*. The English meaning of these terms kept
tolerably close to their Biblical use, for we have it on the authority
of Dean Stanley, that, as far down as the seventeenth century, they were
used in the sense of *preaching* or *speaking*. From that time on they
acquired the Greek meaning, that of "foreseeing or foretelling future
events." In Biblical times, however, that meaning was foreign. Aaron,
Miriam, Deborah, were named respectively prophet and prophetesses
because of their power of speech and song. Moses, Elijah, Elisha, were
named prophets, yet foretelling of events to happen hundreds of years
after their death is not mentioned among their accomplishments. The
ancient Chaldean paraphrases (Targumim)

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

of the Old Testament books, adhere to the original meaning of these
terms, as do many of the Jewish mediæval commentators. Moses even
cautions his people against following "foretelling" prophets, as the
Heathens do, and warns them against believing in them, even if their
signs and wonders come to pass.

The functions of the Biblical prophets were plainly those of preachers
and scribes, of reformers and exhorters, of statesmen and<span
class="margnote">Prophet only deals with present.</span> patriots. They
were the counselors of kings when these governed justly, and their
bitterest opponents when these tyrannized the people. They were the
coadjutors of the priests when these ministered righteously, and their
relentless foes when these degraded their calling. When their services
were not needed, they generally withdrew from the world, and, in their
seclusions, surrendered themselves to profound meditations and ecstatic
reveries on thoughts and matters uppermost in their own or in the
people's minds. But, when there was work for them to do, they were on
hand, and the suddenness of their appearance, the strangeness of their
attire, the fervor of their speech, the depth of their emotions, the
profundity of their thought, the clearness of their vision, the boldness
of their denunciations, the grandeur of their tropes and allegories,
awed

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

the people, and inclined many to look upon them as beings divinely
endowed, and to accept their messages as oracles.

This then is clear, that the "foreseeing and foretelling of future
events" was not a <span class="margnote">Foretelling not function of
prophet.</span>characteristic of the Biblical prophets. We have,
therefore, no historical and no logical right to torture the words of
Isaiah into a prophecy of something to happen hundreds of years after
his death, when, by the very limitations of human finiteness, they could
not possibly have applied to any other events save such as took place
during or prior to his time, or were expected soon to follow as logical
consequences of existing states of affairs, or were cherished as sweet
dreams, as fond ideals.

What the events may have been to which he refers is naturally the next
question that <span class="margnote">To whom or to what does Isaiah
refer?</span>suggests itself. A proper answer to this question
necessitates a proper knowledge of the times in which Isaiah lived. But
which Isaiah? "Ay, there's the rub." Even but a superficial study of the
book of Isaiah suffices to show that it had no less than two authors,
and very likely many more; that about a century and a half stretch
between the first thirty-nine chapters, known as the *Assyrian period*,
and the last twenty-seven chapters, known as the *Babylonian period;*
that chapters of the first part belong to the second part,

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

and vice versa; that the first part is fragmentary, and the second part
largely an anthology of different sacred writings by different men,
during and after the Babylonian captivity, and which, according to the
custom of those days, were attributed to Isaiah, as other writings of
that period were credited to Moses and David and Solomon.

The time of the first Isaiah was about the middle of the eighth century
before our present era. Judea was his country, and Jerusalem<span
class="margnote">Time of the first Isaiah.</span> was his home. His
labors covered the reigns of kings Ahaz and Hezekiah; the former, one of
the wickedest kings who ever ruled over Judea; the latter, one of the
best. The kingdom of Judah was then beset by dangerous enemies. To the
north lay Samaria and Syria, leagued against their southern neighbor. To
the north of these stretched all-conquering Assyria. Ahaz,
terror-stricken by the advance of the united Samarian and Syrian forces,
is about to invite the Assyrian conqueror to his aid. Isaiah fears the
invited Assyrian more than the threatening enemy. The latter may be
repelled, but the invited helper will find Judea a goodly land, and
Jerusalem a powerful fortification, that will prove very serviceable in
his campaign against Egypt, and he will therefore have no scruples about
making himself master of it. Isaiah, deeming it his duty to warn his
king against

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

the proposed alliance, appears before him, points out the danger,
assures him of Judea's ability to cope with the enemy, without any other
help except that of God. Ahaz is distrustful. The weaker the king's
faith, the stronger becomes the faith of the prophet. He must save his
people from their pending doom. He must convince the cowardly king. He
must make him see that victory is nigh. Waxing enthusiastic in his
exhortation, he points to a young expectant woman present at the
audience, probably his own wife, the prophetess, and says, that before
the child, soon to be born, and to be named "*Immanuel*" (God with us),
"shall know to refuse the evil and chose the good, the land that thou
abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings."

This is the simple explanation of the first of the Messianic prophecies
quoted above, <span class="margnote">Explanation of the
"Virgin-child."</span>and which is claimed to foretell the birth of
Jesus to happen some eight hundred years later, and to accomplish this
feat the Hebrew word ‏עלמה‎ meaning *young woman* is erroneously
translated as *virgin*, and the fact that the child is to be named
*Immanuel* is altogether ignored, since Jesus was never known by the
name of *Immanuel*.

Returning to King Ahaz, we find him spurning Isaiah's counsel. He makes
an alliance with Assyria, brings trouble upon his

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

people, continues in his wickedness. Isaiah<span
class="margnote">Explanation of the "Righteous child."</span> is
disappointed, but not disheartened. His hope is in the royal son
Hezekiah, probably his pupil, then about twelve years of age, and who
gives promise of becoming a man of piety and wisdom and goodness and
courage, which promise he fully confirmed as king. It is to this heir to
the throne that the second of our cited Messianic prophecies plainly
points, both historically and grammatically, and not to a child to be
born some eight centuries later, as the King James Version o Isaiah
declares, and to give its declaration a semblance of truth, permits
itself to translate the Hebrew words ‏אל גבור‎ which mean "hero of God,"
into *The mighty God*.

Continuing with the history of that time, we find the alliance of Ahaz
with Assyria working out its destructive course, as Isaiah<span
class="margnote">Explanation of the "lion and lamb symbol."</span> had
feared. Assyria had conquered Syria, had destroyed the kingdom of
Israel, had led the ten tribes into captivity, and was now at the gates
of Jerusalem to deal similarly with the kingdom of Judah. The people are
terror-stricken. Isaiah inspires them with hope and courage. He has
faith in the strength of his people. God will be with them for the
righteous Hezekiah's sake, their young prince and leader. Victory will
be theirs. The prince will mount the throne in his wicked father's
stead, and under him the

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

royal house of David will blazon forth again in all its pristine glory.
The scattered tribes of the kingdom of Israel will reunite with their
brethren of the kingdom of Judah. All jealousies will cease. Peace will
reign supreme. The lion and the lamb will lie down together. None will
hurt and none will destroy, for the earth will be full of the knowledge
of the Lord.

This is the meaning of the third of our above cited so-called Messianic
passages of Isaiah. Much of this came to pass. The Assyrian was defeated
at the gates of Jerusalem. Hezekiah mounted the throne, and fulfilled
many of the expectancies of the Prophet. The people hailed him as their
*Messiah*. He instituted needed reforms, fostered literature, purified
and strengthened religion, inaugurated an era of peace and prosperity,
such as was perhaps never again witnessed in Judah, such as to induce a
Rabbi, many hundred years later, to declare, in the Talmud, that Israel
need not look for a Messiah, that he had already come in the time and in
the person of King Hezekiah.

Turning to the last two of our cited so-called Messianic passages of
Isaiah, we find ourselves<span class="margnote">Explanation of the
"faithful servant."</span> in a different age, and within a different
literature. We are in the Babylonian period, about a century and a half
later than the Assyrian period. In the twenty-seven

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

chapters, which embrace this second division, Chapters XL–LXVI, we trace
the story of Judah's overthrow by the Babylonian conqueror; her being
led into captivity; her longing to return to her native land; her hoping
and praying for a redeemer; his coming at last in the person of the
Persian king Cyrus, the conqueror of Babylon; his permitting the Judean
captives to return; their hailing him, notwithstanding his Persian
belief, as their *Messiah;* their restoration of Jerusalem, and the
commencement of their Second Commonwealth. But in and between, we
encounter passages and fragments of chapters that are of Palestinian
origin,—that refer to times preceding and succeeding the Babylonian
captivity, and which, by different styles and teachings, prove
themselves compositions of different authors and of different times.

Nevertheless, while the meaning of some of the passages is obscure, that
of others is quite clear. Among such we may class the forty-second
chapter, which we have cited above as the fourth of the so-called
Messianic passages of Isaiah. It occurs in the midst of the joyful
expectancy of speedy redemption from Babylonian captivity, and of their
glorification of the Persian deliverer. The personage referred to in
that chapter strongly points to Cyrus. He brings the Gentile

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

captor to terms. He favors Israel; he does not break the bruised reed,
he releases the prisoners from their prison, and leads those that sit in
darkness forth into the light. Applied to Cyrus, this passage has an
historical and natural meaning; applied to Jesus, six hundred years
later, the text has to be tortured into meaning things that never could
have been meant. It cannot be truthfully said of the Nazarene preacher
that he never caused his voice to be heard in public, that he did not
fail, and was not discouraged, before he had established judgment on the
earth. The closely following eighth verse positively prohibits such an
application of the text, since it makes God declare, that He alone is
God, that He will not share His glory with another.

Turning to the last of our cited so-called Messianic prophecies of
Isaiah, we encounter <span class="margnote">Explanation of the Suffering
Martyr.</span>the most famous of them all, the celebrated fifty-third
chapter (including the last three verses of the preceding chapter). Here
the suffering and the crucifixion of Jesus, it is claimed, are more than
foreshadowed, they are literally described. Without considering, for the
present, how the likeness between this Old Testament chapter and
chapters of the New Testament, written eight or ten centuries later,
came about; without stopping to show how in the interest of the

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

missionary success among Jews, New Testament stories were frequently
written with the manifest purpose to harmonize with, or to serve as
fulfilments of, the supposed Messianic requirements of the Old
Testament, let it suffice, at present, that a comparison between the
earlier and later narratives shows, first, considerable of contrast
between the two, and, secondly, that since the earlier narrative is not
even told or written as a prophecy, the later narrative cannot very well
be a fulfilment thereof.

The fifty-third chapter of Isaiah (including the last three verses of
the preceding chapter) is no prophecy. *It speaks in the past tense, and
narrates a past event*. Its author is unknown. It is evidently a dirge
or eulogy or lamentation over some martyr. If the author is of the
Babylonian period, it may refer to Jeremiah; if of the Assyrian period,
it may refer to some prophet persecuted by King Menasseh, who, upon
ascending to the throne, after the death of his father, the good
Hezekiah, imitated the wickedness of his grandfather Ahaz. It may have
referred to the sufferings of *Israel Personified*, the *Servant of
God*. It may not apply to any of those that have been named, but there
cannot be the slightest doubt that it could ever have meant the
martyrdom of Jesus, which occurred centuries later. If the

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

gospel stories of Jesus are true, no eulogy could apply to the
attractive, popular, and winning Nazarene martyr, that says that he was
not only unattractive but also positively repulsive, that people ran
from him as if he were a leper, and hid their faces from him as if
afflicted with foul disease.

Let us turn to some of the other Old Testament writings, and examine a
few of the <span class="margnote">Other portions of Scripture
examined.</span>passages that have been claimed by Christological
writers as prophecies of Christ. In the Book of Judges, in connection
with the infancy of Samson, the giant, we read: "For, lo, thou shalt . .
. bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall
be a *Nazarite* unto God from his infancy, and he shall begin to deliver
Israel out of the hand of the Philistines." Turning to St. Matthew we
read, in connection with the infancy of Jesus: "And he (Joseph) came and
dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a *Nazarene*."

The birthplace of Jesus was manifestly Nazareth. Neither he nor his
disciples denied<span class="margnote">Though born at Nazareth,
Bethlehem assigned birthplace to satisfy prophets.</span> his Nazarene
birth when his Messiahship was opposed on the ground that the Messiah of
the Jews was to be born at Bethlehem. St. Luke, however, satisfies the
Bethlehem requirement by having him born at that place during a
temporary stay of his

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

parents in the city of David; while St. Matthew leads us to believe that
Bethlehem was the original home of Joseph, and that after the birth of
his child he moved to Nazareth "that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the prophets: He shall be called a Nazarene." To fulfill this
prophecy, however, he is obliged to apply to Jesus a phrase that is
spoken of Samson, the giant, twelve hundred years before, and to
misquote it, and to commit the blunder of giving identical meanings to
the two totally different words *Nazarene* and *Nazarite*, the one
meaning an inhabitant of the city of Nazareth, the other meaning a
member of a religious order.

St. Matthew, having thus satisfied, as he believed, the requirements of
the Jews, St. Luke, who is a thorough Roman, is now<span
class="margnote">Christmas assigned as time of birth to satisfy
Gentiles.</span> necessitated to satisfy those of the Gentiles. These
were in the habit of celebrating, amidst great festivities, the fourth
December week, in which the winter-solstice occurred, as the Festival of
the Birth of the Sun, of the Dawn of the New Year. Probably recognizing
that the Gentiles could not be weaned from it, the Apostle retained it,
but with a different significance. He made it stand for the Feast of the
Birth of the Son of God, of the Dawn of the New Light. Unfortunately,
however, this involved him in a new blunder. December being a
winter-month,

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

and the very height of the rainy season of Judea, the shepherds, to whom
the angel brought the message of the birth of the Saviour, could not
have been out in the fields all night with their flocks. Nor is it
likely that, at such an inclement season of the year, the people would
have been summoned to Bethlehem from all parts of Palestine, as St. Luke
informs us in the second chapter of his gospel, for the purpose of
paying their taxes (not to speak of the historical inaccuracy of this
tax-collection in the time of Herod the Great, by order of the Roman
Emperor, when Judea did not become a Roman province till after this
Herod's death); moreover, it is highly improbable that Joseph would have
obliged his wife to accompany him, in her condition, and at such a time,
on so long and so difficult a journey as that which lay between Nazareth
and Bethlehem. It is not an insignificant fact that the other two
gospels contain nothing of these narratives of St. Matthew and St. Luke,
and that the former of these two seems ignorant of the tax-collecting
story of the latter.

St. Matthew then proceeds to tell us that King Herod, hearing of the
birth of Jesus, <span class="margnote">A misuse of text to give cause
for flight to Egypt.</span>and fearing to be supplanted by him, resolves
to destroy him; an angel, however, advises the Holy Family to flee to
Egypt and not to return till after Herod's death, "that it might

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of
Egypt have I called my son." He, moreover, informs us that Herod, unable
to find the Divine child, institutes a massacre of all children of two
years old and under, found at Bethlehem and along the sea coast, thereby
fulfilling Jeremiah's prophecy: "In Rama was there a voice heard,
lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her
children, and would not be comforted, because they are not."

Of all this, however, the other gospels say nothing. And as to the two
references to the prophets, they are most flagrant misapplications, as a
perusal of the text readily proves. The son to be called out of Egypt,
of which Hosea speaks, refers to the children of Israel, the whole
sentence reading: "When Israel was a child then I loved him, and called
my son out of Egypt." The weeping for the children, of which Jeremiah
speaks, refers to their going into captivity, about six hundred years
before the time of Christ. The following verse speaks comfortingly of
their returning again to their own land, which did occur, but which
comforting assurance as to a return could not apply to the children
massacred by Herod, to whom this prophecy is supposed to refer. Besides,
Rama was not Bethlehem, one was a city in Benjamin, the

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

other in Judea; and Rachel was the mother of the Benjamites, and not of
the Judeans. Furthermore, if a massacre, such as St. Matthew speaks of,
bereaving hundreds of families, had occurred, so cruel an event would
surely have been chronicled in Jewish literature alongside the other
cruelties of Herod that are mentioned and described in detail. But no
mention is made, not even a hint is given us, of such a cruelty in the
entire Jewish literature of that period.

Passing over, for the want of time, a number of other supposed
fulfilments of ancient <span class="margnote">Misuse of text to fulfil
entry into Jerusalem.</span>prophecies, we reach the description of our
hero's triumphal entry into Jerusalem. We are told that he sent two of
his disciples to fetch him an ass and a young colt in order "that it
might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: Tell ye the
daughter of Zion, Behold thy king cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting
upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass." The fulfiller of this
supposed prophecy displays both grammatical and historical ignorance.
Ignorant of the parallelism of Hebrew poetry—the same thought or figure
repeated, in slightly altered language, in the line immediately
following—he introduces two asses where but one is meant, and he applies
to Jesus a passage descriptive of the noble Hezekiah's entry into
Jerusalem, and which gave basis to the belief

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

generally held by the prophets of that time, that the Messianic age had
dawned with Hezekiah's ascent to the throne of David, as the following
correct rendition of the text clearly indicates:

"Exult greatly, O Daughter of Zion;  
 Shout for joy, O daughter of Jerusalem:  
 Lo, thy King cometh to thee:  
 Righteous and victorious is he;  
 Lowly, and riding upon an ass,  
 Even upon a colt, the foal of an ass.  
 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim,  
 And the horse from Jerusalem,  
 And the battle bow will be cut off;  
 And he will speak peace to the nations;  
 And his rule will be from sea to sea,  
 And from the river unto the ends of earth."—[Zech. IX,
9](../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009.md).

Reaching the story of Judas’ betrayal, St. Matthew tells us that the
price of his treachery was thirty pieces of silver, that<span
class="margnote">Misuse of text to make Judas a betrayer.</span> he
afterwards repented of his deed, threw the money into the Temple, and
hanged himself; that the chief priests bought a potter's field with the
money, not thinking it lawful to put such money into the treasury; that
all this was in fulfilment of "that which was spoken by Jeremy the
prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of
him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; and
gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed me." There is
much confusion here, and all originating from a mistranslation and
misapplication of the original text. In the

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

first place, St. Matthew has in his mind a passage in Zechariah, which
he erroneously credits to Jeremiah, and which he misquotes. The original
text, which reads: "And I (Zachariah) said unto them: If it be good in
your eyes, give me my reward; and if not, forbear. So they weighed out
as my reward thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said unto me: Cast it
into the treasury, the precious price which I am prized at by them. And
I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them into the House of the
Lord, into the treasury;" this original text tells of the prophet
representing himself as a shepherd of Israel, and receiving as his hire
thirty pieces of silver, and casting that sum into the treasury of the
Temple. This simple account is turned into a prophecy, and in its
fulfilment, language is violated, and agreement with the other gospels
is sacrificed, the word meaning *treasury* is translated into *potter*
(a meaning which this word in Hebrew sometimes has, but not when used as
in this verse), and Judas is made to betray his Master for thirty pieces
of silver, and repenting, to hang himself, though the *Acts of the
Apostles* assures us that, after purchasing the potter's field himself,
he met his death by falling headlong, and bursting in the middle.

In the account of the crucifixion we are told that they "parted his
garments, casting

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: "They
parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture<span
class="margnote">Misuse of text in connection with crucifixion.</span>
did they cast lots." The prophet here referred to is the Psalmist, and a
perusal of the twenty-second psalm, from which this quotation is taken,
shows that it is the supplication of one in despair, possibly of David
in a time of great distress, but more probably of Jeremiah, during the
captivity, crying out: "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me," and
enumerating the wrongs done him by the enemy, among which he mentions
the parting of his garments among them, and the casting lots for his
vesture, and the piercing of his hands and feet. The narrative speaks of
something that has already come to pass, and it could not, therefore, be
a prophecy of what is to take place a thousand or five hundred years
later, without doing violence to the language and history of the Old
Testament.

Here we shall cease. Though much more testimony might be adduced, we
believe enough has been advanced to enable us fully<span
class="margnote">The prophets did not prophesy Jesus.</span> to answer
our question whether the prophets of Israel prophesied Jesus. With the
mass of proof before us we have no other alternative than to answer
*No*. To answer otherwise would necessitate obliterating from our minds
all knowledge of Hebrew and Jewish

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

history. On our side we have, *first*, the original language of the
Bible; *secondly*, the transmitted expounding of it by the learned
schools of Palestine, Babylon, and Alexandria; *thirdly*, our Rabbis’
repudiation of the false interpretations of these cited Old Testament
passages from the time they were foisted upon a credulous world;
fourthly, the Jewish and non-Jewish critical scholarship of the present
age.

Let no one think that, in the rejection of the Divinity of Jesus, the
Jew is animated by <span class="margnote">The Jew cannot regard Jesus as
a God.</span>stubbornness. Why should he be? Why should he reject what
might forever free him from prejudice and persecution? No one has yet
accused the Jew of being indifferent to respectful consideration by his
fellow men, or of being insensible to adversity and suffering. Why
should he voluntarily bring disgrace and misery upon himself, when, by
acknowledging Jesus as his Saviour, he might even become the pet of
nations? He would if he could. But he cannot. He has proven by eighteen
hundred years of suffering that he values truth above earthly gain. He
cannot believe that his incorporeal, invisible, inconceivable God became
human, simply to preach and teach sermons and lessons such as were
preached and taught every day, in the synagogues and schools of
Palestine and Babylon, at the time of Jesus. He cannot

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

believe that his God became human to be slain, so that the world might
be saved through His blood. He cannot believe that his God became human
to save the world—and make such a failure of it as is witnessed by the
wars between Christian nations, by the strifes between Christian sects.

The Jew is proud of Jesus as he is of the other illustrious men of his
race. He believes that he honors him more by denying<span
class="margnote">But he is proud of him as a man.</span> his divinity
than he would by affirming it. By denying it, he rescues his noble
manliness; by affirming it, he would aid in burying it under the rubbish
of myth. He believes he renders humanity a noble service by denying that
a Saviour has come. He believes that he hastens the coming of the
Messianic Age, of which the prophets had dreamed, by placing such noble
men as Jesus before the people for inspiration and imitation. He
believes that salvation lies before us, not behind. With Tennyson he
still looks for "the Christ that is to be." And he will continue to look
for him until every man will be that Christ. Then, and not till then,
will Israel's Messianic hope be realized. Then, and not till then, will
there be peace on earth, and good will among all men.
