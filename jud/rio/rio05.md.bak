"Why should brother deal treacherously against his brother?"—[*Malachi*
ii, 10.](../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#010.md)

"Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not
come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you: till heaven
and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away
from the law, till all things be accomplished. Whosoever therefore shall
break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be
called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whosoever shall do and teach
them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven." *Words of
Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount*.—[St. Matthew v,
17-20](../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#017.md).

ONE of the most celebrated of early Church legends is that which tells
of <span class="margnote">Credulity above reason in former
times.</span>St. Augustine walking one day on the seashore, meditating
on the mystery of the Trinity, and encountering a little child fetching
water in a seashell, and emptying it into a little hole in the sand.
Inquiring of the child as to the motive of its labor, it replied that it
proposed to empty the ocean into the little cavity it had prepared.
"Impossible!" exclaimed St. Augustine. "Not more impossible," answered
the child, "than for thee, O Augustine, to solve the mystery of the
Trinity." Having answered thus, it vanished.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> What the saint had
believed to have been a child thus proved to have been an angel. What he
believed to have been a child's playful utterance thus proved to have
been a divine revelation. From that hour St. Augustine ceased brooding
on the mystery of the Trinity. Henceforth he accepted it on faith.

It was a pretty legend, and it proved very convenient in saving others
from the hopeless task of trying to solve this and other<span
class="margnote">Critical research a necessity in ours.</span>
troublesome mysteries of the Church, and made it easy for them to accept
doctrines and dogmas on the authority of faith, after the example of a
saint of the Church. Those credulous days, however, are no more. That
which was easy and even commendable in former centuries has become
difficult and quite reprehensible in this. The teaching of "Believe, and
be saved" has changed into "Prove, and save thy belief." A mightier
saint than Augustine has risen, whose name is Reason; and be the belief
never so old and never so Church-encrusted, if it bears not the imprint
of this modern saint, it cannot escape being cast aside as myth or
counterfeit. Past is the time when the Church could teach with great
sanity that the greater the impossibility of a belief the greater is its
mystery, and therefore, all the more to be believed. In our age, it has
become

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

an axiomatic truth that the creed worth believing is worth inquiring
into. If it can stand the test of critical inquiry it will be all the
stronger for the test; if it cannot, then not all the credulity in the
world, nor all the authority or enactments or encyclicals of the Church,
will be able to save it.

And also this has become a truth, that, whatever be the attitude the
Christian may <span class="margnote">More especially for the
Jew.</span>take toward subjecting his belief to critical inquiry, with
the Jew it has become a solemn necessity. The honor of our ancestry and
the shame of our posterity make it an obligation.

If all that was enacted last summer in the Passion Play at Oberammergau
be true, we <span class="margnote">If charge true Jew must do penance to
Christ.</span>have no right to continue as Jews. If all the villainies
we are charged with in that play, or in the New Testament, whence that
play derives its text and theme, be true, then the sooner we acknowledge
our guilt, the sooner we call down the everlasting curse of God upon our
ancestors for their heinous crimes against the Virgin-born,
Death-resurrected, Heaven-ascended, Only-begotten Son of God, the sooner
we crawl to the Cross and there pour out our very souls in contrition,
the better will it be for our honesty and for our future salvation.

But if our searching inquiry prove the New Testament teachings against
the Jews

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

false, unfounded, the invention of malice, the fabrication of policy,
then it becomes our <span class="margnote">If false, Christian must
right wrongs against Jew.</span>sacred duty, for our suffering
ancestry's sake, and for the sake of our posterity doomed to suffer, not
to rest, nor to keep silent, till all the world shall know the wrong
that has been done to us, and that is still being done, till the
Christian himself, conscience-stricken at last, shall feel moved to
recognize his error, expunge it from his Scriptures, banish it from his
pulpit, and atone for all his past outrages against an innocent people
by an amplitude of love in the future.

To the Passion Play, therefore, let us return, and continue the analysis
we have thus far made. In our last discourse, reading the<span
class="margnote">Triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem
re-stated.</span> entry of Jesus and his followers into Jerusalem in the
light of history, we saw how a band of peasants, fishermen and artisans
had made their way from the interior country of the north to Jerusalem,
the southern capital of Judea, at that time a tributary province of
Rome, under one of the most cruel of Roman governors, Pontius Pilate;
how, in their longing for deliverance from their cruel oppressor, and in
the state of hysterical and credulous excitement in which they lived,
they had deluded themselves into the belief that Jesus, the gentle
preacher and healer, was the looked-for Deliverer of the nation; how, in
their enthusiam and in their ignorance of

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rome's military
strength at Jerusalem, they had permitted themselves to make a triumphal
entry with their hero, and to proclaim him, in the capital, "King of the
Jews!"—a proclamation shout that in the ear of the Roman meant high
treason in that seditious era, and called for dire and speedy
punishment.

Before continuing the story of Jesus in the light of history, let us
hear what follows <span class="margnote">He creates a riot on the Temple
mount.</span>upon Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem, as enacted on
the stage of Oberammergau, or as told in the pages of the gospels.
Scarcely had the echo of the exultant Messiahship proclamation of the
rustic pilgrim-band died away, when Jesus approached the booths in which
sacrificial offerings were for sale, and the stands where the foreign
money of the pilgrims was changed for the native coin, and in bitter
language denounced the merchants for trafficking within the sacred
Temple grounds. And yet more bitterly he turned upon the priests and
scribes for permitting such a desecration of the Sanctuary, denouncing
them as utterly corrupt. And working himself into a passion, he seized a
scourge, and with it lashed the merchants out of their shops, upset
their tables, brushed their money to the ground, set free the doves,
poured out the oil, scattered the spices, and created a general havoc
among

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

the wares, and consternation among the priests and people.

As an invention of dramatic interest, the introduction of this scene was
a happy thought, and as a bit of acting it was superb.<span
class="margnote">Which is historically false.</span> As a bit of
history, however, it was a flagrant blunder, a blunder that made the
malicious object of its introduction only too painfully apparent. It
would certainly have been a strange proceeding for a leader, far-famed
for his gentleness and forbearance, for a Prince of Peace, for an
exultantly proclaimed "King and Deliverer of his People," to inaugurate
his Messianic reign with starting a riot among the people, with openly
and fiercely attacking the priests and teachers of Israel, with laying
violent hands on the bodies and properties of people peacefully pursuing
their lawful trades—and all this in one of the courts of the Temple
grounds, at a time when pilgrims were streaming to the Sanctuary for the
celebration of their festival of liberty, at a time when the Roman
garrison in Fort Antonia, almost within earshot of his voice, was keenly
on the alert for the slightest outbreak among the revolution-suspected
people.

If ever there was a time when peace was needed among Israel itself, that
was the time; and if ever there was a man to <span
class="margnote">Jesus not a man of passion or riotousness.</span>knit
the people in closest bond of mutual sympathy

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

and helpfulness in the hour of the country's direst distress, Jesus was
that man. Not he the man to brand the teachers of his people
"hypocrites," "scorpions," "whited sepulchres." There was not enough of
gall in him to force such words to his lips. He who preached to love the
enemy, to bless those that curse, to do good to those that harm, to
resist no evil, certainly could not harm nor curse them that had not
harmed nor cursed. This bitter denunciation of the teachers of Israel is
the language of the later-day Romanized vindictive theologians of the
Church militant. From his earliest childhood, at his mother's breast, he
had drunk in the Jew's reverence of the teacher in Israel, of the judge
who judges in God's stead; and in all his studies of the history of
Israel he had not come across a time when the teachers of Israel were
more deserving of reverence than in that age that produced a Philo, a
Hillel, a Gamaliel, a Jochanan ben Saccai. Too many a pilgrimage had he
made to Jerusalem, in accordance with the requirement of the Mosaic Law,
during the thirty-three years of his life, not to have known that the
sale of sacrificial offerings, and the exchange of foreign money for
native coin, within that court of the spacious Temple grounds, called
the Court of the Gentiles, were practices authorized by

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

the Temple statutes, and, far from being a profanation, was an
accommodation to the pilgrim, as is the sale of crosses, candles,
rosaries, or votive offerings, near the doors of cathedrals, at the
present day.

Had that scene been true, that of a stranger, at the head of a band of
country-people, making a treasonable entry into Jerusalem,<span
class="margnote">If true, Rome would have silenced him at once.</span>
and then rushing upon the traders’ booths in one of the Temple courts,
destroying property, lashing people, abusing priests and teachers,—had
that scene been true, the watchful Roman in Fort Antonia close by would
have recognized in this newly proclaimed "King of the Jews" not a mere
deluded creature (who was to be quietly hunted out in the dead of night;
to avoid troublesome disturbance during the assembling of the pilgrims),
but a dangerous fanatic and agitator, a public disturber of the peace,
to be seized and silenced at once. For no offense at all, simply for
causing a commotion among the people, merely for creating a fear of an
uprising, Herod Antipas had, but a short time before this riot, caused
the banishment and imprisonment of John the Baptist, and subsequently
his decapitation. It was on this very Temple mount, and likewise on the
Passover festival, that, some years before this, a revolution had broken
out under the reign of Herod Archelaus,

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

which was quelled only after great bloodshed; and it was there, and
again on the same festival, that, shortly after this, another revolution
broke out against the Roman Procurator Sabinus, with the same bloody
results. It was for that very reason that Rome feared the annual
approach of the Passover, and that the Roman cohort held the Temple
mount under vigilant surveillance, and that the Procurator himself made
it his duty to take up his residence in the city of Jerusalem shortly
before and during this festival, to be on hand in case of an uprising.

Had that scene been true, we would never have heard of Jesus entering
the Temple for <span class="margnote">If true, Jesus would never have
entered Temple.</span>worship, immediately after his public display of
passion and riotousness. The desecrated state of the Temple and the
corruption of the priesthood, of which he had but just complained so
bitterly, would have prevented his entering a "den of thieves," a "hive
of wickedness," for divine service. Had not he himself taught that God,
being a Spirit, is everywhere, and they who seek Him in spirit and in
truth will find Him everywhere, in the secret closet as much as in the
public synagogue? And had he not been taught by the Rabbis that
wheresoever man draws nigh unto God there God draws nigh unto man? Had
he not worshipped before and after in places other than the Temple? He
had no need,

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

therefore, of the Temple to satisfy his craving for worship; nor would
his foot ever have crossed its threshold, had it been the place of
corruption the Passion Play represented it, and the gospels teach it to
have been.

And never prayed man with a devouter congregation than Jesus prayed that
day in the midst of his brethren. And never was<span
class="margnote">Never a devouter congregation than gathered at that
time.</span> Temple freer from corruption than was that of Jerusalem at
that time. Theirs was a woful time. Never a day closed that brought not
its fear of the coming morn. The veriest tyro could read athwart the sky
that the final death-struggle between Judea and Rome was at hand. It was
a tearful time, and, therefore, a prayerful time. It is only in seasons
of ease and luxury that the heart turns from God and yields easily to
corruption. In a time of stress and storm such as was Israel's in the
days of Christ, heart and soul and mind are humble; eye is very
quick-sighted to religious duty, and ear very sharp to God's command.
God then is a stern reality, worship a comfort, religion a stay. Had
they been less scrupulous about their religion and their Temple, they
would have been less opposed to the Roman, and thereby would have
suffered less of his cruelty.

Oh, the infamy, to charge the Jews of the

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

time of Christ with making of their Sanctuary<span
class="margnote">Charge of Temple corruption infamous.</span> a place
for barter and gain, when they regarded it a sacrilege even to enter the
Temple carrying a staff or purse, or with shoes or dust upon their feet!
Oh, the infamy, to charge the Jews of the time of Christ with making of
their Temple "a hive of wickedness," when they offered the bitterest
opposition to Herod's profanation even of the city of Jerusalem by the
erection of a theatre in which golden images formed part of the
decorations! Oh, the infamy, to charge the Jews of the time of Christ
with making of their Temple "a den of thieves," when, upon Pontius
Pilate's soldiers entering the city of Jerusalem carrying on their
standards the image of the Roman Emperor, the people arose in great
numbers, and for five days and nights besieged the Procurator for the
removal of the images, and on the sixth day heroically bent their bare
necks under his soldiers’ swords rather than trespass against the Second
Commandment, and permit the presence of images within the Holy City! Oh,
the infamy, to make of Jesus a ruthless denouncer of Temple priests and
teachers, a reckless breaker of laws, a dangerous disturber of the peace
at a dangerous time, when his very heart bled for his people, when his
very soul thirsted for the Temple, when at the mere

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

sight of Jerusalem he had wept, when but one yearning possessed his
ecstasized spirit: to bring to his people peace and not war, joy and not
sorrow, hope and not despair; when for that peace and joy and hope he
had braved to hear himself proclaimed the Messiah, had dared a traitor's
death upon a Roman cross!

But time is pressing, and so we must turn from these historic
reflections once more to the tragic scenes of the Passion Play.
While<span class="margnote">All Jerusalem represented plotting against
Jesus</span> Jesus and his disciples are engaged in their devotions
inside the Temple, there are very busy doings outside. Seemingly the
whole city of Jerusalem, with its hundreds of thousands of people, is
represented as animated by but one thought: how to revenge itself on
that one country-enthusiast who had been proclaimed "King of the Jews"
by a band of country-people, and who had entered upon his Messiahship by
destroying property, lashing people, denouncing priests and teachers.
Let us pause long enough to ask ourselves what would happen if a band of
country-people, from some northern interior gubernia of Russia, had made
a triumphal entry into Moscow, had rushed upon the Kremlin, had there
proclaimed its leader "Czar of all the Russias!" had then rushed upon
the shops and booths in the vicinity of the Cathedral of St. Michael, in
which ikons,

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

candles and other church paraphernalia are offered for sale, upsetting
counters, overturning tables, destroying property, lashing merchants,
denouncing priests and officers,—what would happen? A detachment of
soldiers would speedily be ordered out to seize or scatter the rioters,
and to give the leader, if not a taste of the hangman's rope, a chance
to cool off, and to work off, his ardor in one of the Siberian mines.

But not so at Jerusalem, as represented in the Passion Play. Jesus and
his disciples are permitted to finish their devotions in the Temple, are
allowed to make their way in peace to the hills back of Jerusalem, while
the whole Temple court is afire with clamors for revenge. Two High
Priests, the heads of the academies, judges of the courts, chiefs of the
Sanhedrin, high officials and dignitaries, hold solemn conclaves, secret
meetings, with all the insignia of office, to devise ways and means how
they might obtain possession of this unarmed, unknown, unprotected,
unbefriended, Nazarene enthusiast, and in all their speeches and
accusations and plottings and proposed cruelties give expression to a
venomous maliciousness, to a bitterness of hatred, that could not
possibly have been more intense even if a whole legion of devils had
broken loose against the Jews, that could not possibly have been worse

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

even if the poor deluded Galilean had snatched from off the chiefs of
the nation all their honors and had placed them upon his own head, even
if the gentle preacher had leagued himself, at the head of a mighty
army, with the Roman, sworn to the destruction of the Temple and of the
Holy City.

A hatred as bitter as this must have a commensurate cause; a fear such
as theirs of proceeding against him openly must have <span
class="margnote">Hatred must have cause.</span>a reason. It is an axiom
in criminology that unless there is a motive there can be no crime.
Their not proceeding against him openly could not have been from fear of
the Roman, for even if Jesus had been guilty of the Temple riot, more
yet had he offended against Rome by his public act of treason. It could
not have been from fear of causing needless bloodshed among the
followers of Jesus, for most of these had been won over to their side by
artful pleas and speeches, and hence it would have been quite an easy
matter to seize him and put him out of harm's way. How shall we account
for this hatred of the chiefs of the nation? Had it been a Herod, the
detested semi-heathen, the assassin of three of his sons, the murderer
of his wife and relatives, the slayer of hundreds of the people and of
scores of the chiefs of the Sanhedrin, had this abhorred Idumæan come
into their power, such a venomous hatred

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

as was theirs, that was content with nothing short of death, would have
been quite intelligible, even if unpardonable.

But—granted even that Jesus had been guilty of the Temple riot, which,
considering <span class="margnote">Proclamation as "Son of David" no
cause.</span>his delusion, an arrest, or a fine, or an expulsion from
the city, would have amply expiated—what crimes had he committed against
the Jews to have merited such bitter execration, such a hatred to the
death? Was it his having been proclaimed "Royal Son of the Royal David"?
There was humor in that, but no offense. None knew better than the
Rabbis of the Sanhedrin the genealogical tables of the Davidian House in
the city of Bethlehem close by, and that the carpenter's son of far-away
Galilee had no place in it, nor ever had laid claim to it himself.

Was it—if it be true—his having boasted, while the delusion was still
upon him, that if <span class="margnote">Nor his boasting of
supernatural powers.</span>they would tear down the Temple, he would
restore it in three days? There was humor in that, but no offense;
seeing that it had taken forty-six years to build the Temple, and that
even then it was not yet finished, there was little danger of their
obliging him with tearing it down so as to give him a chance to restore
it in three days.

Was it the report of his preaching, that had reached Jerusalem? Sifting
the real <span class="margnote">Nor his teaching.</span>preaching of
Jesus from that which was credited to

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

him a century or two later for certain doctrinal and polemical and
vengeful reasons, of which I shall speak in my next discourse, there was
nothing that Jesus ever preached or taught that had not the heartiest
endorsement of the Rabbis of Israel. Not a precept had he ever uttered
that had not proven him a Hebrew of Hebrews. His every word breathes of
the religious and moral and social atmosphere of his time. His every as
is the translation into deed of the aspirations of the pious and
cultured Jew in the days of Palestine's bondage under the cruel Roman.
His every declaration to the people is a restatement of his fundamental
position that he had not come to make common cause with the Gentile, but
to preach to Israel; that he had not come to antagonize nor to destroy,
but to fulfil; that he had not come to remove as much as a jot or tittle
of the Law and the Prophets, but to preserve their institutions and to
conserve their spirit. His every admonition to the people was a
reiteration of the teaching of Moses to worship the One God, and to love
Him with all their heart and soul and mind, and to love their neighbors
as themselves. His every teaching with regard to the Scribes and Rabbis,
members of the Sanhedrin, was that they sit in Moses’ seat, and
whatsoever they bid that should be done. His very manner of teaching,
his

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

aphorisms and quotations, his parables and illustrations, is the manner
of the Rabbis of his time. Not a reform principle that he taught, which
they had not taught; not a ceremonial abuse to which he objected, which
they had not objected to; not an ethical lesson that he enjoined, which
they had not enjoined; not a prayer that he offered, which they had not
offered; the very "Lord's Prayer" was a specimen of the kind of prayer
they prayed; the very "Golden Rule" was the Rule taught in every school.

Or perhaps this fiendish hatred of the Rabbis against one of their own
was due to <span class="margnote">Nor his healing.</span>the reports
that had reached them of the wondrous miracles he had wrought in healing
the sick, in ridding afflicted ones of evil spirits, in awakening people
out of trances. Making due allowance for exaggeration—the invariable
concomitant of popular glorifications of popular heroes—there was
nothing in his cures that could give offense, that, on the contrary,
could not but give delight. There was nothing in this that to the Rabbis
could even seem strange. Rome's cruelty, the Herodian outrages, fear of
the approaching national catastrophe, intense excitement, had made it an
age of widespread and deep-seated nervous disorders, an age of all sorts
of delusions, hallucinations, hysterias, catalepsies, which, as the
Rabbis themselves had

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

experienced, yielded quite readily to the sympathetic, soothing look,
word, touch, treatment of men of such large magnetic and spiritual
powers as Jesus proved himself to have possessed.

What, then, could the motive have been of a hatred as fierce as that
which the Passion Play exhibited on the part of the Rabbis<span
class="margnote">No motive—all invention.</span> against Jesus? The
answer is quite simple: as a historic fact, there was as little hatred
as motive. There is not one word of truth in all these trumped-up
charges against the Rabbis, in all the gospel-recorded bitterness of
Jesus against the Scribes and Pharisees, or of the Scribes and Pharisees
against Jesus. There was as little knowledge of it as there was cause
for it at the time of his fatal collision with the Roman law, and Rome's
cruel interpreters and executers of it. And there was no knowledge of
it, as we shall see in our next discourse, till a century or two later,
when in the interest of policy, and for the sake of propagation of the
new creed in the Roman Empire, and because of hatred of the protesting
Jew, the Roman had to be cleared of the guilt of having killed the
Christ he was asked to worship, and the Jew had to be charged with
having been the Christ-killer, because he refused to accept him as his
Saviour.

In the light of history, let us follow the fate

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

of Jesus a little further, before we return to <span
class="margnote">Makes preparation for his seizure.</span>the Passion
Play. He knew that his last hour had come. Sorrowing yet more for the
faithful twelve than for himself, he tells them delicately that his end
is nigh; but they understand him not. At any moment the Roman might
appear, and well he knows what would follow. He has himself to get
ready, but above all he must get his disciples out of the way. If the
Romans come upon them unexpectedly, they will seize him and nail him
upon the cross as a deterrent example to other "would-be Kings of the
Jews," and mercilessly mow down his devoted disciples. He is ready to
die a martyr's death, but the others must not suffer because of him. He
must bid them flee to Galilee. He must withdraw from them on some plea,
must send one of the trustiest of them, one who had proven his executive
ability as treasurer of the little band, Judas of Kariyoth, to make his
whereabouts known to the Romans, must bid him to do quickly that which
he is to do, so that but the Master alone might die, a martyr to the
cause, so that by his death the others might be saved. Better that one
die for all than that all should die for one. Such was to be his
*vicarious atonement*. Thus was he to take upon himself *the sins of
those who had believed in him*.

Sad and stirring as this story is of his last

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

hours on earth, how marred it has been by shameful admixtures of
anti-Jewish theological<span class="margnote">Introduction and
description of Judas Iscariot.</span> venom of a century or two later!
How different this tearful story in the Passion Play! All that dramatic
art and diabolical villainy could gather together are crowded into a
climax of treachery that stands unrivalled in the whole range of the
world's fiction. It is the *pièce de resistance*, without which the
Passion Play would have been deprived of the most exciting of its
dramatic interest. Here angel and miracle are introduced. Here the heavy
villain, Judas Iscariot, plays his part, and to the bitter end. His very
garb, look and gait are calculated to arouse bitterest hatred. Yellow
robe, the emblem of envy and treachery; a money-bag in his girdle, to
serve as emblem of the Jew's greed of gold; sharp, restless eyes; shaggy
hair; a haggard face; a snake-like glide;—an appearance so repulsive as
to prove at once the historic impossibility of the character, since a
nature like that of the noble-minded and pure-hearted Jesus could never
have attached to himself in closest intimacy a character whose very
presence dripped poison, whose very voice spoke hypocrisy, whose very
eyes sent daggers’ thrusts. Everything that is vile in human nature is
pressed into that one character of Judas Iscariot. He is covetous,
dishonest, mean, rapacious, cunning,

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

treacherous. While yet associating with his Master, while yet breaking
bread with him at the common table, he is selling him to the priests and
scribes for filthy lucre, for thirty shekels of silver, for about twenty
dollars. While yet his Master hails him "friend," and offers his cheek
to him for the kiss of friendship, there is back of him an armed mob of
Jews, to whom that kiss is the signal for laying violent hands upon the
friend who had so implicitly trusted his disciple.

It was a difficult rôle, but Johann Zwink was equal to it. And of him it
may be truly <span class="margnote">Dramatically thrilling.</span>said
that he was about the only *actor* in that whole cast of some eight
hundred players. A human being of heart and soul could never *feel* such
a part, could but *act* it. And he had only to think of the type of Jew
as represented by Church Fathers in the early centuries, as pictured by
fanatics during the Dark Ages, as held up for derision and persecution
during the Middle Ages and among modern Anti-Semites, and he had all the
models he needed for that miserable character, which—although each of
the other disciples was a *Jew* as was the Master himself—was so enacted
as to convey the impression that *Judas* alone typified the nature and
the way of *the Jew*. At one of the vilest parts of the traitor's
acting, a locomotive close by gave a terrible shriek. To me this

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

modern engine-shriek, in the midst of a piece of ancient-day mendacity,
sounded like a modern protest against this villification of one of the
disciples of Jesus. A lady near me shuddered—did she shudder at the
baseness of the Jew?

And that same Johann Zwink had played the part of St. John during the
preceding two decennials. What a change from St. John<span
class="margnote">But no basis in fact.</span>, the most beloved of all
the disciples of Jesus, to Judas, the most execrated of all men! But as
unlike as the real character of Johann Zwink, the decorator of
Oberammergau, is to the Judas of his impersonation, so unlike was the
real Judas of Kariyoth to the Judas Iscariot of the Passion Play or of
the gospel stories. There is not one word of truth in all this treachery
attributed to him. Examine it from whatever point of view we may,
contradiction and disproof are the invariable results.

Examining it *scripturally*, we have no record of "the treachery of the
kiss" in the gospel of St. John, which, as the record of the<span

disciples, the bosom friend whom Jesus took to his heart, purports to be
one of the most faithful of all the accounts of the life of Christ. We
have glaring contradictions as to the end of Judas between *St. Matthew*
and *The Acts*. We are told of Christ's announcing his approaching

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

seizure and end before yet any knowledge of Judas’ treachery is had. We
are told of Christ's washing the feet of Judas, calling him friend,
eating the Paschal meal with him, and all this with full knowledge that
Judas is in the meantime bargaining for the Master's destruction. We are
told of Jesus having often and publicly taught in the Temple, and of his
having made a public entry into Jerusalem, and yet it required a
traitor's kiss to point him out to members of the Sanhedrin who have
come to arrest him.

Examining it *theologically*, we are confronted by the difficulty of
Jesus, as is doctrinally<span class="margnote">Theologically
false.</span> taught, knowing all things from the beginning of time,
reading the hearts and minds of all men, and yet accepting that viper
for his closest associationship, choosing him for one of his disciples,
for one of the elect, permitting the other eleven to run the chance of
being corrupted by this miscreant.

And there is that other difficulty, that of Christ knowing of the
treachery about to take place, and yet doing nothing to prevent it; on
the contrary, urging it on by stinging words. Even if Christ's
crucifixion had been pre-ordained, as is doctrinally taught, would it
not have been Christ-like to have held up to Judas the enormity of the
crime he was about to commit, to have conquered his wicked intention by
showing him that the

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

martyrdom had to be suffered, treachery of not, and thereby to have made
a saint of one about to become the blackest of criminals, and all for
the paltry sum of twenty dollars Such a triumph over a trusted disciple
could not but have been easy for a Christ, seeing how many other sinners
he is reported to have turned from the evil of their way! How should
later preachers hope to convert sinners in the name of Christ, when
Christ himself could not convert one of his own trusted friends? Having
it in his power to prevent the crime, and not doing it, may be well
enough for dramatic purposes, but is all wrong for the morals of a
Saviour, for the theology of a God. If, according to the Divine plan,
the treachery had to be committed, if just in that way Christ's death
had to be effected for the salvation of mankind, then the guilt ought to
be laid against the theology rather than against Judas. If that was the
Divine plan, did not Judas do what had been ordained to be done? Unless
my common sense has deserted me, I cannot possibly come to any other
conclusion than this: If the treachery of Judas was infamous, the
theology that necessitated it was infinitely worse.

Examining it *historically*, we have the fact of a bishop of the early
Christian Church, a century after Christ, named *Judas*, which<span
class="margnote">Historically false.</span>

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

name, if the treachery had then been known, would have been as
impossible as it is impossible for a Christian, Jew, or American to name
his son, respectively, Nero or Pharaoh, or Guiteau. Moreover, we have
the fact that—excepting one slight and contradictory notice in a
fragment of Papias, and a spurious reference in the New Testament
Apocrypha—the early Christian literature, so rich in lore on other
characters, good or bad, makes no mention of *Judas*, which could never
have been the case if so fertile a story for moralizing purposes had
then existed. Next we are told of the bargaining, for the
treachery-price, going on on the *Paschal* night before the assembled
Sanhedrin, and of *Judas*, together with a number of the members of the
Sanhedrin, leading an armed Jewish guard against Jesus, on that same
sacred night, when, in the *first* place, Rome at the time permitted no
Sanhedrin sessions; *secondly*, even if it had permitted, no Sanhedrin
session could be held, according to Jewish Law, on the sacred Paschal
night; *thirdly*, there was no armed Jewish guard to arrest any man, and
no right to punish, even if there had been an armed guard to arrest;
*fourthly*, the Paschal night, when the place of every Jew was in the
privacy of his home for the Passover celebration, was of all nights the
most impossible one for Jews to be prowling

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

about in the outskirts of the city, in search of a prisoner, while for
the Roman it was the best night possible for quietly seizing and
dispatching a traitor, without creating a needless commotion among the
people.

Examining this Judas-treachery story in the light of third century
polemics, its origin and motive become quite intelligible.<span
class="margnote">Invented for polemical purposes.</span> *Judas* stood
to the Roman as the name of the hated Judean, the name Jew being in the
Roman language *Iudæus*, and in the Greek language *Ioudaios*. The name
of *Judas*, the Maccabee, had been the battle-cry with which the Judean
had rushed against the Roman. *Judas*, the Galilean, had led the zealots
in a revolutionary onslaught on the Romans. Rome had bitter memories of
the name of *Judas*. No other name could waken in her as bitter a hatred
and contempt as this. No other name could lend itself more helpfully
than that of *Judas*, in branding the hated and obdurate Judean with the
guilt of treason that was connected with the death of Christ. It was a
well-aimed dart,—and it hit the very heart. And within the Jew's heart
that poison-tipped and hatred-barbed dart has remained to this day.

Let us turn from this horrible falsehood of polemical fiction to history
once more, and take yet one glance of Jesus, before the <span
class="margnote">Christ's agony and arrest at Gethsemane.</span>forenoon
part of the Passion Play is ended. He is

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

all alone in the Garden of Gethsemane. His followers are dispersed. His
disciples are scattering. He is on his knees, and in the throes of
agony. His whole frame shakes with emotion. His doom is nigh. And yet
would he live—his people is still oppressed, and he still so young. He
opens his lips, and prays: "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass
from me; if not, then not as I will but as Thou wilt." Oh, how human is
all this, how unlike a death-struggle of a God! And yet, how divine
because so human!

A second time and a third time he prays: "Father, if this cup may not
pass from me except I drink it, Thy will be done." He has his answer.
Not his, but God's will is done. The Roman is upon him. Bravely he steps
forward, and, without a tremor in his voice, says: "I am the Jesus of
Nazareth whom ye seek." He is bound—but not bowed. He is a Roman
prisoner—but a Jewish patriot still. His career is ended. He is on the
road to the *via crucis*, to the way of the cross.

It was a large crowd, yet a silent crowd, that wended its way from the
great hall at <span class="margnote">How will it end?</span>the
noon-hour recess. Deep sorrow seemed spread over every face. The rapid
pace seemed checked; the head seemed bowed. Walking along and thinking,
I remembered having read in a German paper of some one

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

having been overheard saying, as he came away from the Passion Play at
the noon recess: "The play is not so bad; I wonder how it will end."
That one presumably did not know much of the end of Christ. But we Jews
know it, and know it well. It has been etched into our souls, burnt into
our flesh with fire and sword, with garrote and gibbet, on the rack, at
the stake, in the Ghetto. Well I knew how the play ended, and yet, when
I considered the falsity I had listened to, the hatred and the malice I
had seen enacted, when I reflected upon the wrong that has been done to
us, I could not but ask myself: How will it end? When will justice be
done to the Jew?
