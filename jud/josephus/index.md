Josephus was born Joseph ben Mattathias in 37 C.E. in Jerusalem of a
priestly and royal family. He excelled in his studies of Jewish law and
studied with the Sadducees, Pharisees, and the Essenes, eventually
aligning himself with the Pharisees. In 62 C.E. he went to Rome to free
some imprisoned priests. After accomplishing this mission through the
intercession of Nero's wife, Poppaea, he returned to Jerusalem in 65
C.E. to find the country in revolt against Rome.

Although Josephus had deep misgivings about the revolt, it became
inevitable, due to reasons he discusses in his history, primarily the
abuses of the Romans; this spurred the growth of fanatical Messianic
Jewish movements which believed that the world was coming to an end
shortly. In 66 C.E. the Masada was seized by the Zealots and the Romans
were on the march; Josephus was appointed the commander of Galilee.

Josephus had to fight a defensive war against overwhelming force while
refereeing internecine squabbles in the Jewish ranks. In 67 C.E.
Josephus and other rebels were cornered in a cave during the siege of
Jotapata and took a suicide pact. However, Josephus survived, and was
taken hostage by the Romans, led by Vespasian.

Josephus shrewdly reinterpreted the Messianic prophecies. He predicted
that Vespasian would become the ruler of the 'entire world'. Josephus
joined the Romans, for which he was branded a traitor. He acted as
consultant to the Romans and a go-between with the revolutionaries.
Unable to convince the rebels to surrender, Josephus ended up watching
the second destruction of the Temple and the defeat of the Jewish
nation.

His prophecy became true in 68 C.E. when Nero committed suicide and
Vespasian became Ceasar. As a result, Josephus was freed; he moved to
Roman and became a Roman citizen, taking the Vespasian family name
Flavius. Vespasian commissioned Josephus to write a history of the war,
which he finished in 78 C.E., the Jewish War. His second major work, the
Antiquities of the Jews, was completed in 93 C.E. He wrote Against Apion
in about 96-100 C.E. and The Life of Josephus, his autobiography, about
100. He died shortly after.

Despite his ambivalent role, Josephus was an eyewitness to history, and
his writings are considered authoritative. These texts are key to
understanding a pivotal point in world history, which has tragic
repercussions even to this day.
