Josephus was born Joseph ben Mattathias in 37 C.E.
in Jerusalem of a priestly and royal family.
He excelled in his studies of Jewish law and studied with the
Sadducees, Pharisees, and the Essenes, eventually aligning himself
with the Pharisees.
In 62 C.E. he went to Rome to free some imprisoned priests.
After accomplishing this mission through the intercession
of Nero's wife, Poppaea, he returned to Jerusalem in 65 C.E. to find the
country in revolt against Rome.</P>

<P>
Although Josephus had deep misgivings about the revolt,
it became inevitable, due to reasons he discusses in
his history, primarily the abuses of the Romans;
this spurred the growth of fanatical Messianic Jewish
movements which believed that
the world was coming to an end shortly.
In 66 C.E. the Masada was seized by the Zealots and the Romans were
on the march; Josephus was appointed the commander of Galilee.</P>

<P>
Josephus had to fight a defensive war against overwhelming
force while refereeing internecine squabbles in the Jewish ranks.
In 67 C.E. Josephus and other rebels were cornered in a cave during the
siege of Jotapata and took a suicide pact.
However, Josephus survived, and was taken hostage by
the Romans, led by Vespasian.</P>

<P>
Josephus shrewdly reinterpreted the Messianic prophecies.
He predicted that Vespasian would become the ruler of the 'entire world'.
Josephus joined the Romans, for which he was branded a traitor.
He acted as consultant to the Romans and a go-between
with the revolutionaries.
Unable to convince the rebels to surrender, Josephus ended up
watching the second destruction of the Temple and the defeat of the
Jewish nation.</P>

<P>
His prophecy became true in 68 C.E. when Nero committed suicide and
Vespasian became Ceasar.
As a result, Josephus was freed; he moved to Roman
and became a Roman citizen, taking
the Vespasian family name Flavius.
Vespasian commissioned Josephus to write a history of the war,
which he finished in 78 C.E., the <CITE>Jewish War</CITE>.
His second major work, the <CITE>Antiquities of the Jews</CITE>, was 
completed in 93 C.E.
He wrote <CITE>Against Apion</CITE> in about 96-100 C.E.
and <CITE>The Life of Josephus</CITE>, his autobiography, about 100.
He died shortly after.</P>
<P>
Despite his ambivalent role, Josephus was an eyewitness to history,
and his writings are considered authoritative.
These texts are key to understanding a pivotal point in
world history, which has tragic repercussions even to this day.</P>
