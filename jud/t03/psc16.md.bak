# APPENDIX B.

(SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECOND NOTE, PAGE [66](psc06.htm#page_66)..md)

IT seems to us necessary, in explanation of this curious passage, to
make the following extract from our "History of Amulets":

It is no wonder that the change of one letter in a word resulted in the
writing of volumes upon volumes and the adoption of hundreds of
restrictions.

The following instance will illustrate this: R. Jehudah being once in a
company of friends advised the housekeeper not to use for bread-making
any other water than that kept in the house, and he expressed it in six
words:

‏אשה לא תלוש אלא במים שלנו‎

(A woman should not knead with other than *our* water). The reason was
that other water might have been poisoned by snakes, which are abundant
in those countries. R. Jehudah said this in reference to the dispute in
the *Boraitha* (Terumath VI.) where one maintained that bread made with
water kept in an uncovered vessel outside the house should be burnt,
even if it were bread of *Terumah*. R. Nehemiah was of the opinion that
the snake poison loses its power when brought into contact with fire,
and therefore that the bread might be used. To avoid this, R. Jehudah
advised the use of *domestic* water, which he expressed by the word
(‏שלנו‎ "our."

R. Mathna, who lived sixty years after R. Jehudah, happened to be in the
city of "Papuni" and on a certain occasion (probably

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

having some objection to the use of the water of that city) lectured in
public about using the water which collects in the public streets, and
he quoted R. Jehudah's original words: "A woman should not knead with
other than *our* water." The people present understood R. Mathna to have
brought some water along with him because of his using the word "our."
They therefore came to him the next day with vessels to get some of this
water. Then R. Mathna explained in the Talmudic language that he meant
domestic water, namely

‏אנא במיא דביתא קאמרינא‎

using the word (‏דביתא‎) (d'baitha with an ‏א‎) at the end, having the
meaning "domestic." In course of time the word *d'baitha* was
incorrectly copied and the Aleph (‏א‎) at the end was changed to Vav
(‏ו‎), which would make it mean "which has remained over night." The
Rabanim, finding the word in this changed form (‏דכיתו‎) concluded that
it related to the Matzoth (unleavened bread) used at the Passover and
therefore maintained that the water used in making Matzoth must remain
over night in the house before it is used. Neither R. Jehudah nor R.
Mathna mentioned this, but it was assumed simply because these words of
R. Jehudah are found in that tract of the Talmud which treats of the
Passover feast. The later Rabanim wrote volume after volume upon this
subject (see our journal *Ha-Kol*, Nos. 286, 287, 290, etc.). Still they
could not give the least explanation of why they referred this to the
Matzoth, and they did not care to investigate where R. Jehudah got it
from nor how Matzoth were kneaded before his time.
