# APPENDIX.

WE think it will please our readers to have placed before them the
following letter, written by a Gentile who had witnessed the services at
the Second Temple on the Day of Atonement. We give the entire extract as
it is translated in "Shevet Jehudah" by Solomon Aben Virga, who
translated it from a letter written by Versovius to King Alfonso the
Pious, although it began with the Feast of Passover, part of which is
already mentioned in Tract Pesachim, as it will be of much interest to
the historian to know some details of the Jewish services at the Temple.

EXTRACT FROM A LETTER WRITTEN BY VERSOVIUS TO KING ALFONSO THE PIOUS,
WHO COPIED IT FROM A WRITTEN REPORT SENT BY MARCUS, CONSUL OF JERUSALEM,
TO ROME.

. . . *Tenth*.--Concerning the service at the Temple, these Jews were
reluctant to inform me about it, as they declared it was against their
law to inform a Gentile about the manner of their serving God. They have
enlightened me upon two subjects only, part of which I saw with my own
eyes, and was greatly rejoiced thereat. One was the sacrifice which they
brought on the feast that they call Pessach, and is considered to be the
greatest of all their feasts; and the second is the entrance of the
high-priest, whom we call *sacerdote mayor*, into the Temple on the day
which to them, in regard of holiness, purity, and strengthening of the
soul, is the most important of all the days in the year. The Pessach
sacrifice, which I have partly witnessed, as also, as I was told, the
entire ceremony, takes place in the following manner. When the beginning
of the month which they call Nissan approached, by the command of the
king and the judges, swift messengers visited every one in the vicinity
of Jerusalem who owned flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, and ordered
him to hasten to Jerusalem with them, in order that the pilgrims should
have sufficient animals for sacrifices and food; for the people were
then very numerous, and whoever did not present himself at the appointed
time, his possessions were confiscated for the benefit of the Temple.
Consequently all owners of flocks and droves came hastily on, and
brought them to a creek near Jerusalem, and washed and cleaned

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

them of all dirt. They believed that in regard of that Solomon said
\[Solomon's Song iv. 2\]: "A flock of well-selected sheep, which are
come up from the washing." When they arrived at the mountains which
surround Jerusalem, the multitude was so great that the grass was not
seen any longer, as everything was turned white, by reason of the white
color of the wool. When the tenth day approached--as on the fourteenth
day of the month the sacrifice was brought--every one went out to buy
his paschal lamb. And the Jews made an ordinance, that when going forth
on that mission, nobody should say to his neighbor, "Step aside," or
"Let me pass," even if the one behind was King Solomon or David. When I
remarked to the priests that this was not seemly nor polite, they made
answer that it was so ordered, to show that there is no rank before the
eyes of God, not even at the time of preparing to serve Him, more
especially at the service itself; at that time all were equal in
receiving His goodness. When the fourteenth day of the month arrived,
they went to the highest tower of the Temple, which the Hebrews called
Lul, and whose stairway was made like those in our church towers, and
held three silver trumpets in their hands, with which they blew. After
the blowing, they proclaimed the following: "People of the Lord, listen!
The time for slaughtering the paschal lamb has arrived. In the name of
Him who rests in the great and holy house!" As the people heard the
proclamation, they donned their holiday attire; for since midday it was
holiday for the Jews, being the time for sacrifice. At the entrance of
the great hall stood twelve Levites on the outside, with silver staves
in their hands; and twelve within, with gold staves in their hands. The
duties of those on the outside were to direct and to warn the incoming
people not to injure one another in their great haste, and not to press
forward in the crowd, to prevent quarrels; as it previously happened on
one of the feasts of Pessach, that an old man, together with his
sacrifice, was crushed, in consequence of the great rush. Those on the
inside had to preserve order among the outgoing people, that they should
not crush each other. They were also to close the gates of the hall when
they saw that it was already full to its capacity. When they reached the
slaughtering place, rows of priests stood with gold and silver bowls in
their hands: one row had all gold bowls and another row had all silver
bowls. This was done to display the glory and splendor of the place.
Every priest who stood at the head of the row received a bowl full of
the sprinkling blood. He passed it to his neighbor, and he to his, until
the altar was reached; and the priest who stood next to the altar
returned the bowl empty, and it went back in the same manner, so that
every priest received a full bowl and returned an empty one. And there
occurred no manner of disturbance, as they were so used to the service
that the bowls seemed to fly back and forth, as the arrows in the hand
of a hero. For thirty days previous they practised that service, and,

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

therefore, found out the place where there was the possibility that a
mistake or a mishap might occur. There were also two tall pillars, on
which stood two priests with silver trumpets in their hands, who blew
when each division began the sacrifice \[the paschal lamb was
slaughtered in three divisions--see Pesachim\], in order to give warning
to the priests who stood on their eminence to begin Hallel amid jubilee
and thanksgiving, and accompanied by all their musical instruments; on
that day, namely, they brought forward all the instruments. The
sacrificer also prayed the Hallel. If the sacrifice was not ended,
Hallel was repeated. After the sacrifice, they went into the halls,
where the walls were full of iron hooks and forks; the sacrifices were
hung upon them and skinned. There were also many bundles of sticks; for
when there were no more empty hooks, they put a stick upon the shoulders
of two of their number, hung the sacrifice upon it, skinned it, and put
the particular portion upon the altar, and went away rejoicing, as one
who went to the war and returned victorious. The one who did not bring
the paschal lamb at the appointed time, was eternally disgraced. During
the service the priests were dressed in scarlet, that the blood which
might accidentally be spilled on them should not be noticed. The garment
was short, reaching only to the ankle. The priests stood barefoot, and
the sleeves reached only the arms, so they should not be disturbed
during the service. On their heads they had a cap, around which was tied
a three-ell-long band; but the high-priest, as they told me, had a band
which he could tie around his cap forty times. His was white. The ovens
in which they roasted the paschal lambs were before their doors, in
order, as they told me, to publish their religious ceremonies, also on
account of the festival joys. After the roast, they ate amid jubilee
songs and thanksgiving, so that their voices were heard from afar. No
gate of Jerusalem was closed during Passover night, because of those who
were constantly coming and going, who were considerable in number. The
Jews also told me that on the Feast of Pessach the number of those,
present was double of that which went out of Egypt, for they wished to
acquaint the king with their number.

The second service was the entrance of the high-priest in the sanctuary.
Of the service itself they did not tell me, but of the procession to and
from the Temple. Some of it I have also seen with my own eyes, and it
surprised me so greatly that I exclaimed: "Blessed be He who imparts His
glory to His nation!" Seven days before that day which they call
Atonement Day, and which is the most important in the entire year, they
prepared at the house of the high-priest a place and chairs for the
chief of the courts, the Nassi, the high-priest, his substitute, and for
the king; and besides these, also seventy silver chairs for the seventy
members of the Sanhedrin. The oldest of the priests got up and delivered
an oration before the high-priest, full of earnest entreaty. He said:
"Bethink thyself

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

before whom thou enterest, and know that if thou wilt loose the devotion
of thy mind, thou wilt at once drop down dead, and the forgiveness of
the Israelites will come to naught. Behold! the eyes of all Israelites
are turned upon thee. Investigate thy deeds. Perchance thou hast
committed some slight sin; for there are sins which equal in weight many
good deeds, and only the Almighty God knows the weight thereof.
Investigate also the deeds of the priests, thy brothers in office, and
have them repent. Take it to heart, that thou art going to appear before
the King of all kings, who sits upon the throne of judgment, who sees
everything. How darest thou to appear, when thou hast the enemy within
thee!" The high-priest then makes answer that he has already
investigated himself, and has repented all that which seemed to him
sinful; that he has also already assembled all the priests, his brother
officers, in the Temple, and by Him who rests His name there conjured
them that each one should confess the transgressions of his brother
officers, as well as his own, and that he prescribed for each
transgression a corresponding repentance. The king also spoke to him
kindly, and promised to shower upon him honors, when he should safely
come out of the sanctuary. After that it was publicly proclaimed that
the high-priest was about to take possession of his room in the Temple.
Whereupon the people made ready to accompany him, and marched before him
in the following order, which I witnessed myself: First went those who
traced their ancestry to the kings of Israel, then those who were nearer
in the priesthood; then followed those who were of the kingly house of
David, and, indeed, in the most perfect order, one after the other, and
before them was exclaimed: "Give honor to the family of David!" Then
followed the Levites, before whom it was exclaimed: "Give honor to the
family of Levi!" Their number amounted to 36,000. At this time the
substitute Levites donned blue silk garments; but the priests, 24,000
strong, donned white silk garments. Then followed the singers, the
musicians, the trumpeters; then the closers of the gates, the preparers
of the incense, the preparers of the holy curtains, the watchers, the
masters of the treasury; and then a corps which was called
*chartophylax*; then all who were employed at the Temple, then the
seventy members of the Sanhedrin, then a hundred priests with silver
staves in their hands to make room, then the high-priest, and behind him
the older priests in pairs. At the corner of every street stood the
heads of the colleges, who spoke to him thus: "High-priest, enter in
peace. Pray to our Creator for our preservation, so that we may occupy
ourselves with the study of His Law." When the procession reached the
mount of the Temple they halted and prayed for the preservation of the
kings of the house of David, then for the priests and the Temple,
whereat the *Amen* exclamation, because of the great crowd, was so loud
that the birds overhead fell to the ground. After that the high-priest
bowed before the entire

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

people very respectfully, and, weeping, separated himself from them all,
and two substitute priests led him into his room, where he took leave of
all the priests, his brothers in office. All that took place at the
procession to the Temple; but at the procession from the Temple his
honor was double, for the entire population of Jerusalem marched before
him, and most of them with burning candles of white wax, and all attired
in white; all windows were draped with varicolored kerchiefs and were
lighted dazzlingly, and, as the priests told me, the high-priest, during
many years, because of the great crowds and rush, could not reach his
house before midnight; for although all fasted, nevertheless they did
not go home before they convinced themselves whether they could kiss the
hand of the high-priest. On the following day he prepared a great feast,
to which he invited his friends and relatives, and made that day a
holiday, because of his safe return from the sanctuary. After that he
caused a goldsmith to make a gold tablet with the following inscription
engraved upon it: "I, so and so the high priest, son of so and so the
high-priest, have performed the service of the high-priest in the great
and holy Temple, in the service of Him who rests His name there, in the
year of creation so and so. May He who favored me with the performance
of that service, favor also my son after me, to perform the service
before the Lord."
