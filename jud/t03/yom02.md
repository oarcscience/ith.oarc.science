TO THE

VENERABLE PRESIDENT OF THE HEBREW UNION COLLEGE

AND OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN RABBIS' CONFERENCE

THE REV. DR. ISAAC M. WISE

AT HIS

EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY

THIS VOLUME WITH THE ENTIRE SECTION MOED, IS MOST RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED
BY HIS SINCERE FRIEND

MICHAEL L. RODKINSON

NEW YORK, 1899.

<span id="page_iv">p. iv</span>

MOST HONORED RABBI:

When, five years ago, in the month of October, I had the honor to visit
you, and then expressed my sorrow in not being able to attend your
seventy-fifth birthday, I promised you that I would write a work and
dedicate it to you for your eightieth birthday. Now, after the lapse of
five years, I praise God that He has preserved us both. I have fulfilled
my promise, and written a work on the History of the Talmud, which I
believe to be of some value, with the intention of dedicating it to you,
but my circumstances do not allow me to publish it in time for your
celebration. However, I redeem my promise in dedicating to you the
Section Moed, which at that time I had no intention of translating into
English.

I hope to see your ninetieth birthday, when, among all your disciples
and admirers who will celebrate it, I also may take part.

M. L. R

### EXPRESSION OF THANKS.

WITH the issue of this volume this section is almost complete (the last
two volumes being in press), and I deem it my duty to express my
heartfelt thanks to my patrons and supporters during the last three
years, ever since my work was undertaken. Through their support I have
been enabled to reach my present position. This is the first time in the
history of the Talmud that an entire section of it was translated into a
living and comprehensible language, making it easily understood even to
a layman. The synopsis of each tract indicates where the most
interesting ethical and folkloristic portions way be found, thereby
rendering the various tracts readily understood, even by one who is not
a student.

Three years ago, when I made up my mind to begin this work, I scarcely
dared hope that thirteen <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0) tracts of the
most difficult part of the Talmud would be translated, more especially
that seven of them, the most voluminous, would be published in the
course of two years. Notwithstanding all the obstacles that were laid in
my way by personal enemies, and notwithstanding all the financial
difficulties <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) which I had to surmount,
I have succeeded in accomplishing the work mentioned above, chiefly
through the aid of the few gentlemen who have encouraged me by enlisting
their sympathy and interest in my work, and who also supported me
financially, <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2) not as a matter of
charity, but

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

in the form of a subscription and payment in advance for the forthcoming
volumes, for the issue of which in due time they have reposed their
confidence in me.

Many friends have assured me that this work is destined to become
historical, and as the Talmud has indeed a great history, the first
translation of it in a foreign tongue cannot fail to attract attention,
and therefore I trust that my work will add somewhat in demonstrating
its value and importance. In that event all the names of my supporters
and sympathizers who will be known to the future historian (which may be
after my death) will be mentioned with honor.

With this view in mind, I enumerate herewith with grateful
acknowledgment the names of my supporters since this work began, and
especially those who aided me during the last two months of the past
year, and enabled me to publish the present volume by paying for from
twenty-seven to ten forthcoming volumes, at the rate of $2.50 each, in
advance. May God bless and prosper them in all their undertakings!

I also extend my thanks to all my subscribers, far and near, for their
kindness in the past, hoping at the same time that it will be extended
in the future. I am also grateful to the rabbis of the city of New York,
who, with very few exceptions, sympathize with my work, and have
assisted me with their influence and subscriptions.

The list of patrons is arranged alphabetically. The asterisk indicates
that the volumes already delivered and paid for are NOT included.
Asterisk and dagger indicate also the subscription for two sets. The
list of names on page ix shows those added during the last two months of
the past year.

I have to thank once more the following gentlemen and lady, who, besides
their subscriptions, have also exerted their influence in insuring me a
considerable number of subscribers:

Messrs. Samuel Greenbaum, Daniel P. Hays, Isaiah Josephi, Andrew Saks,
and Miss Annette Kohn.

I trust that in the last volume of this section this list of supporters
will be greatly increased, as I still need further assistance, till the
section is completed, when I am confident that I will derive good
financial returns from its sale to booksellers and general agents, who
are awaiting the completion of the section, to be sold *en masse* as a
complete work by itself.

I am hopeful that the coming generation will be grateful to all those
who took part in opening a scaled book to the eyes of the world.

Finally, I express my thanks to my printer, ex-Congressman Hon. Joseph
J. Little, who has granted me considerable credit in his establishment,
thereby greatly lightening the burden of my work; also to his
proofreader for calling my attention to many matters which seemed to him
imperfect, and whose assistance I value greatly, and last, but not
least, to Mr. A. S. Freidus of the New York Public Library, for many
valuable suggestions in bibliographical and other matters.

MICHAEL L. RODKINSON.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[vii:1](yom02.htm#fr_0) The translation of one
tract of section Jurisprudence is also already completed.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[vii:2](yom02.htm#fr_1) It must be borne in mind
that the cost of publishing one volume is $700 or more.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[vii:3](yom02.htm#fr_2) In my "History of the
Talmud" I take notice of the writers who complain that the Jewish people
were always opposed to the translation of Jewish lore into foreign
languages. They, moreover, assert that all the translations of the
Bible, and all the collections of Hebrew manuscripts, as also the
Massorah, were supported by different governments and private Gentiles.
Zunz ("Ges. Schr.," vol. i., p. 296), in recommending a translation of
the Talmud, also relates (p. 273) that the Russian Government, in July,
1829, paid 12,000 thalers to the Abbé Chiarini for a translation of the
Talmud in the French language. In one of his works, issued at Paris, the
latter complains that the Hebrews opposed and prevented him from
accomplishing his commission. See also Wolfsohn's "Jeschurun," p. 242,
Breslau, <span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>1604. it is also a
well-known fact that Emperor Nicholas I. of Russia assigned 100,000
rubles for a translation of the Talmud; and that Dr. Pinner, who
translated tract Berachoth into German, a work considered of little
merit by all scholars, nevertheless received 10,000 rubles from him. A
German translation of the Talmud is now being published through the
effort of Gentiles. I am proud to say that I am the first who has not
sought the support of Gentiles, and that all that I have done was
brought about by my coreligionists.
