# THE COLUMBUS PLATFORM

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In view of the changes that have taken place in the modern world and the
consequent need of stating anew the teachings of Reform Judaism, the
Central Conference of American Rabbis makes the following declaration of
principles. It presents them not as a fixed creed but as a guide for the
progressive elements of Jewry.

### A. Judaism and it's Foundations

*Nature of Judaism.* Judaism is the historical religious experience of
the Jewish people. Though growing out of Jewish life, its message is
universal, aiming at the union and perfection of mankind under the
sovereignty of God. Reform Judaism recognizes the principle of
progressive development in religion and consciously applies this
principle to spiritual as well as to cultural and social life. Judaism
welcomes all truth, whether written in the pages of scripture or
deciphered from the records of nature. The new discoveries of science,
while replacing the older scientific views underlying our sacred
literature, do not conflict with the essential spirit of religion as
manifested in the consecration of manUs will, heart and mind to the
service of God and of humanity.

*God.* The heart of Judaism and its chief contribution to religion is
the doctrine of the One, living God, who rules the world through law and
love. In Him all existence has its creative source and mankind its ideal
of conduct. Though transcending time and space, He is the indwelling
Presence of the world. We worship Him as the Lord of the universe and as
our merciful Father.

*Man.* Judaism affirms that man is created in the Divine image. His
spirit is immortal. He is an active co-worker with God. As a child of
God, he is endowed with moral freedom and is charged with the
responsibility of overcoming evil and striving after ideal ends.

*Torah.* God reveals Himself not only in the majesty, beauty and
orderliness of nature, but also in the vision and moral striving of the
human spirit. Revelation is a continuous process, confined to no one
group and to no one age. Yet the people of Israel, through its prophets
and sages, achieved unique insight in the realm of religious truth. The
Torah, both written and oral, enshrines Israel's ever-growing
consciousness of God and of the moral law. It preserves the historical
precedents, sanctions and norms of Jewish life, and seeks to mould it in
the patterns of goodness and of holiness. Being products of historical
processes, certain of its laws have lost their binding force with the
passing of the conditions that called them forth. But as a depository of
permanent spiritual ideals, the Torah remains the dynamic source of the
life of Israel. Each age has the obligation to adapt the teachings of
the Torah to its basic needs in consonance with the genius of Judaism.

*Israel.* Judaism is the soul of which Israel is the body. Living in all
parts of the world, Israel has been held together by the ties of a
common history, and above all, by the heritage of faith. Though we
recognize in the group loyalty of Jews who have become estranged from
our religious tradition, a bond which still unites them with us, we
maintain that it is by its religion and for its religion that the Jewish
people has lived. The non-Jew who accepts our faith is welcomed as a
full member of the Jewish community. In all lands where our people live,
they assume and seek to share loyally the full duties and
responsibilities of citizenship and to create seats of Jewish knowledge
and religion. In the rehabilitation of Palestine, the land hallowed by
memories and hopes, we behold the promise of renewed life for many of
our brethren. We affirm the obligation of all Jewry to aid in its
upbuilding as a Jewish homeland by endeavoring to make it not only a
haven of refuge for the oppressed but also a center of Jewish culture
and spiritual life. Throughout the ages it has been IsraelUs mission to
witness to the Divine in the face of every form of paganism and
materialism. We regard it as our historic task to cooperate with all men
in the establishment of the kingdom of God, of universal brotherhood,
Justice, truth and peace on earth. This is our Messianic goal.

### B. Ethics

*Ethics and Religion.* In Judaism religion and morality blend into an
indissoluble unity. Seeking God means to strive after holiness,
righteousness and goodness. The love of God is incomplete without the
love of one's fellowmen. Judaism emphasizes the kinship of the human
race, the sanctity and worth of human life and personality and the right
of the individual to freedom and to the pursuit of his chosen vocation.
justice to all, irrespective of race, sect or class, is the inalienable
right and the inescapable obligation of all. The state and organized
government exist in order to further these ends.

*Social justice.* Judaism seeks the attainment of a just society by the
application of its teachings to the economic order, to industry and
commerce, and to national and international affairs. It aims at the
elimination of man-made misery and suffering, of poverty and
degradation, of tyranny and slavery, of social inequality and prejudice,
of ill-will and strife. It advocates the promotion of harmonious
relations between warring classes on the basis of equity and justice,
and the creation of conditions under which human personality may
flourish. It pleads for the safeguarding of childhood against
exploitation. It champions the cause of all who work and of their right
to an adequate standard of living, as prior to the rights of property.
Judaism emphasizes the duty of charity, and strives for a social order
which will protect men against the material disabilities of old age,
sickness and unemployment.

*Peace.* Judaism, from the days of the prophets, has proclaimed to
mankind the ideal of universal peace. The spiritual and physical
disarmament of all nations has been one of its essential teachings. It
abhors all violence and relies upon moral education, love and sympathy
to secure human progress. It regards justice as the foundation of the
well-being of nations and the condition of enduring peace. It urges
organized international action for disarmament, collective security and
world peace.

### C. Religious Practice

*The Religious Life.* Jewish life is marked by consecration to these
ideals of Judaism. It calls for faithful participation in the life of
the Jewish community as it finds expression in home, synagogue and
school and in all other agencies that enrich Jewish life and promote its
welfare. The Home has been and must continue to be a stronghold of
Jewish life, hallowed by the spirit of love and reverence, by moral
discipline and religious observance and worship. The Synagogue is the
oldest and most democratic institution in Jewish life. It is the prime
communal agency by which Judaism is fostered and preserved. It links the
Jews of each community and unites them with all Israel. The perpetuation
of Judaism as a living force depends upon religious knowledge and upon
the Education of each new generation in our rich cultural and spiritual
heritage.

Prayer is the voice of religion, the language of faith and aspiration.
It directs man's heart and mind Godward, voices the needs and hopes of
the community and reaches out after goals which invest life with supreme
value. To deepen the spiritual life of our people, we must cultivate the
traditional habit of communion with God through prayer in both home and
synagogue.

Judaism as a way of life requires in addition to its moral and spiritual
demands, the preservation of the Sabbath, festivals and Holy Days, the
retention and development of such customs, symbols and ceremonies as
possess inspirational value, the cultivation of distinctive forms of
religious art and music and the use of Hebrew, together with the
vernacular, in our worship and instruction.

These timeless aims and ideals of our faith we present anew to a
confused and troubled world. We call upon our fellow Jews to rededicate
themselves to them, and, in harmony with all men, hopefully and
courageously to continue Israel's eternal quest after God and His
kingdom.
