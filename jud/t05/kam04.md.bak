# TRACT BABA KAMA (THE FIRST GATE).

### CHAPTER I.

THE FOUR PRINCIPAL TORT-FEASORS; THE DIFFERENT MODES OF RESTITUTION; THE
VICIOUS AND NON-VICIOUS ANIMALS; THE APPRAISEMENT BEFORE THE COURT.

MISHNA *I*: There are four principal causes of tort (expressly mentioned
in the Scripture): the ox; the (uncovered) excavation; the mabeh (the
pasture of one's cattle in another's field); and the fire. The measure
of the damages done by the ox is different from that of the damages done
by the mabeh, and *vice versa*; and that of both, which are animated
beings, is not like that of the damages caused by the fire, which is not
animated. And the measure of damages caused by the three last mentioned,
which are movable, is different from that of the damages caused by the
(uncovered) excavation, which is stationary. One thing, however, is
common to all, and that is, that they are all likely to do damage, which
must be guarded against, and if damage is done, the one responsible for
it must make good from his best estates.

GEMARA: If the Mishna states that there are "principals there must be
derivatives. Are those derivatives as their principals or not? Said R.
Papa: "Some of them are and some of them are not?" (as explained further
on). The rabbis taught: "It was said of the ox that he has three
principals, the horn, the tooth, and the foot. Of the horn the rabbis
taught: It is written \[Ex. xxi. 28\]: "If an ox *gore*," and goring is
only with the horn, as it is written \[Deut. xxxiii. 17\]: "And his
horns are like the horns of reem; with them shall he push (gore)," etc.
What is the derivative of the horn? Hurting, biting,

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

lying upon, <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) and kicking; (because they
are usually done intentionally, as goring). Why is "goring" called a
principal? Because it is written \[Ex. xxi. 28\]: "If an ox gore?" Let
also hurting be a principal, because it is written \[ibid., ibid. 35\].
"And if a man's ox *hurt*." That hurting means goring, as we have
learned in the following Boraitha: "It starts out with hurting, and it
ends with goring, to teach thee that the hurting mentioned here means
goring." Why does the Scripture in case of a man use the term "gore,"
while in the case of an animal it uses the term "hurt"? For a man, who
is fortunate, <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md) (who is guarded by his
planet) "gore" is used (because it is certain that the ox gored him
intentionally with all his might to harm him), but of an animal, which
is not fortunate, "hurt" is used, and by the way it teaches us that an
ox which is vicious toward a human being is considered vicious toward an
animal, which case is not so in the reverse. But is then "biting" not
the derivative of the "tooth"? Nay, the tooth usually derives benefit by
doing the damage (consuming), which is not the case with biting. Are not
lying upon and kicking the derivatives of the foot (because it cannot be
done without bending of the feet)? Nay, damage by the foot is of
frequent occurrence (because whenever the animal walks and there is
something in the way it damages it), which is not the case with the
above. But to what does R. Papa refer in stating that the derivatives
are not like their principals? Shall we assume that he refers to those
just stated? This cannot be, for they are all of the same nature, as
stated above, and the owner must guard against it, and he must pay the
damage. We must therefore say that there is no difference between the
principal and derivatives of the horn, and R. Papa's statement refers to
the derivative of the foot, in case of doing damage by digging up gravel
with the foot, in which case only one-half of the amount of the damage
must be paid, and which is Sinaic (*i.e.*, the restitution is for actual
damage and not as a fine, which is always the case whenever one-half
damage is paid). But why is this case called a derivative of the foot?
(only one-half of the damage is paid, while in the case Of the principal
the whole must be paid). It is a derivative in respect that (by the same
tradition that if the damage-doing animal

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

is not of sufficient value to pay the amount of the damage) the balance
must be paid from the best of one's estates, which is only so in case of
damage by the foot. Is the latter part of this then certain? Did not
Rabha further on (page [33](kam05.htm#page_33).md) propound a question
wherefrom the damages shall be collected? (This does not matter.) Rabha
was not certain about it, but R. Papa was. Why, then, is it called a
derivative of the foot, even according to Rabha's theory, who was not
certain about it? To equal it to the foot in that respect, that it is
not liable if the damage was done on public ground (as damages done by
the foot are not paid unless done on the ground belonging to the party
damaged).

"*And, mabeh*," etc., "*and fire*," etc. What is meant by mabeh <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)"? Said Rabh: "It means a man"; Samuel,
however, said it means the tooth (of the ox). Why does Rabh not explain
it as Samuel? Because when the Mishna states "ox," it means everything
with which an ox can do damage (consequently "mabeh" must be something
else). And what is the reason of Samuel? Is Rabh's opinion, then, not
correct? The Mishna states ox. Said Rabh: "It states 'ox' for the damage
done by the foot, and 'mabeh' for that done by the tooth, and it must be
explained as follows: The law of damages done by the foot, which is of
frequent occurrence, cannot be applied to that of the tooth, which is
not of frequent occurrence; on the other hand, the law of damage done by
the tooth, which usually benefits thereby, cannot be applied to that of
the foot, which derives no benefit."

But what is the matter with the horn? Why is it left out? This is
included in the statement, "And if they do damage, the one responsible,"
etc. Why is it not mentioned expressly?

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Mishna states
only cases of those which are considered vicious from the very beginning
(and must pay the full amount of damage, as tooth and foot, etc.), but
not cases of those which are not considered vicious from the beginning
(as the horn, which pays the full amount of damages only on the third
time of doing damage). Why does Samuel not concur with Rabh? He
maintains that it cannot mean a "man," because this latter is enumerated
in a subsequent Mishna: "A vicious ox, and an ox doing damage on the
estate of the party suffering the damage, and the man." Why is "man" not
mentioned in the first part of the Mishna? Our Mishna treats only of
injuries done by one's property, but not of injuries done by one's
person. Now as to Rabh, is then the "man" not enumerated in the
subsequent Mishna? (Why, then, state it also in our Mishna?) Rabh may
say: "It is mentioned in the later Mishna only because other vicious
ones are mentioned therein, and according to him (who says that 'mabeh'
means a man) the statement in the Mishna, 'the law of damages,' etc.,
must be explained thus: "The law of damages of an ox differs from that
of a man in that the former pays 'atoning money,' while the latter does
not (if a vicious ox kill a man by goring he pays atoning money,
therefore if only the law of the ox would be stated, that of the man
could not be deduced therefrom, because if a man kill another man
unintentionally he is banished; if intentionally he suffers the death
penalty, and pays no atoning money); and the law of a man differs from
that of an ox in that the former is liable (in case of personal injuries
caused to another man, in addition to the payment of actual damages) to
four things (explained further on), which is not the case with the ox;
the one thing common to both is that they are likely to do damage, and
one is charged with taking care of them." \[Is it then usual for an ox
to do harm? It means a vicious one. But is it then usual for a man to do
harm? Yea, when asleep. How is it to be understood? It is usual for a
man when asleep to contract and stretch out his limbs, and all that is
then in his way he damages.\] But is not the man charged with his own
care of himself? This can be explained as R. Abbuhu said elsewhere to
one Tana: "Read, 'The man is charged with his own care of himself'"; so
also is it to be read in our Mishna (and the statement in the Mishna
that one is charged with taking care of them refers to the others
mentioned).

R. Oshiyah taught: There are thirteen principal tort-feasors:

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

the depositary; the one loaning for use; the bailee for hire; the bailor
for hire; the actual damage sustained through the personal injury; the
expense incurred in curing the injury; the earnings lost through such
injury and the shame suffered (this will be explained in Chapter VIII.),
and those four principals mentioned in our Mishna, which make thirteen.
(The depositary is liable for arbitrary damage; the one loaning for use
is liable even for an accident; and the bailee for hire and the bailor
for hire are responsible even for theft and loss, and, manifestly, for
arbitrary damage; actual damage means that if one inflicts an injury on
another person he must pay the difference in value of the person
injured; the pain suffered, *i.e.*, so much as one whose arm, for
instance, was to be amputated by an instrument would pay to be relieved
by a drug from such pain as amputation would cause; all the others are
explained further on in this volume.) Why did the Tana of our Mishna not
state those nine? It is correct according to Samuel, because the Mishna
treats only of injuries done by one's property, and not of injuries by
one's person, but according to Rabh (who says that "mabeh" means a man,
and so injuries by one's person are treated of) why does he not state
them? The Mishna treating of "a man" means to include all damages done
by a man. And according to R. Oshiyah, are they not included in the
"man" stated in the Mishna? There are two kinds of damages done by man,
viz., those done by him to another man (which constitute a crime), and
those done by him to an ox (in which case the liability is restricted to
civil damages only). If so, why not state the same thing in regard to an
ox? Let him state a case where an ox injured a man, and a case where he
injured another ox. What question is this? As to a man there is a
difference between the injury done to a man and that done to an ox, for
in the former he is liable for the four things, and in the latter case
he pays only actual damages (and therefore both are stated); but in the
case of an ox, what difference is there between the injury done by him
to a man and that done by him to an ox? In both cases he pays only
actual damages.

R. Hyya taught: "There are twenty-four principal tort-feasors, viz.,
those who pay double \[see Ex. xxii. 4\]; those who pay four or five
\[ibid. xxi. 37\]; the thief (who confesses his guilt, in which case he
pays only the actual value) and the robber (who is also a principal
because he is mentioned in the Scripture \[Lev. V. 23\]; the collusive
witness; the one who commits rape (is a

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

principal because mentioned in Deut. xxii. 29); the seducer \[mentioned
in Ex. xxii. 16\]; the slanderer \[Deut. xxii. 19\]; the one who defiles
heave-offering; the mingler (one who mingles together heave-offering
with ordinary food); the one who brings a drink-offering (to the idols);
(the three latter are not mentioned in the Scripture, but still they are
principals for they pay pecuniary damage, and the latter is stated in
the Scripture); and these with those thirteen mentioned above make
twenty-four.

But why does R. Oshiyah not enumerate these mentioned here? He
enumerates only those who pay actual damages, but not those who pay in
form of a fine. If so, why does he not enumerate the thief and the
robber who pay actual damages (as explained above)? He does so, for he
states the depositary and the one loaning for use (in the case of the
depositary it very often occurs that he sets up as a defence that it was
stolen from him, and we have learned elsewhere that if one sets up a
defence of theft or robbery he is responsible as a thief and robber).
And as to R. Hyya, does it not state the depositary and the one loaning
for use? He states separately property which came *lawfully* into his
possession (as in the case of the depositary, etc.), and property which
came *unlawfully* into his possession (as the thief).

It is correct according to the Tana of our Mishna, who states
"principals" because there are also derivatives (which were enumerated
above), but according to R. Hyya and R. Oshiyah if they state
"principals" there must be derivatives; what are they? Said R. Abbuhu:
They are all as principals in that respect that the damage must be paid
from the best estates. What is the reason? It is deduced by an analogy
of expression; in all those cases either the word "for" or "give" or
"pay" or "money" is written. (Where it is written "for" we deduce it by
analogy from the "for" stated as to the vicious ox, as there it is from
the best estates (which in turn is deduced from the tooth and foot); so
also it is here, if "give" or "pay" is written we deduce it from the ox
that gored a slave where these words are written; if "money" is written
we deduce it from the pit where the same word is written; and in all
those cases it is paid from the best estates.)

"*The law of the damage done by an ox is not like that*," etc. For what
purpose does he mention this here at all? Said R. Zbid in the name of
Rabha: "He means to say with that, that no question should be raised why
the Scripture does not state

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

one of the tort-feasors and leave the others to be deduced (by way of
analogy) therefrom, for one cannot be deduced from the other (as it is
stated above; Rabh according to his theory and Samuel according to his).

"*And that of both which are animated*," etc. For what purpose does the
Tana mention this? Said R. Mesharshia in the name of Rabha: "He means to
say that it should not be questioned why the Scripture does not state
two of the tort-feasors (the ox and the mabeh), and fire would be
deduced from these two; for this one cannot be deduced from those two
(for the one is not like the others, etc., as stated in the Mishna).
Said Rabha: "If any one of these should be mentioned with the 'pit,' all
others could be deduced from those two by reason of having something
common to all (as *e.g.*, if he would state the pit and the horn, the
tooth could be deduced thus: the pit, the nature of which is not to move
and do damage, must pay; the more so the tooth, the nature of which is
to do so; and if you should say the pit is made from the very beginning
to do damage, which is not so with the tooth, I will cite you the horn
(which is not made so); and if you will say that the horn does the
damage intentionally, I will cite you the pit and the conclusion will
return (the former argument will be reinstated); the one thing common to
all is that it is their nature to do damage, and one is charged with
taking care of them, etc. I will also bring in the tooth. In such a way
I would also deduce the foot, if the pit and the horn should be stated;
and if it should be objected that the pit is from the beginning made to
do damage, which is not so with the foot, the horn would be cited; and
if it should be objected to on the ground that the horn does damage
intentionally, the pit would be cited. And so forth as to all, with the
exception of the horn, for the objection might be raised that they are
all considered vicious from the beginning (which is not so with the
horn). For what purpose, then, did the Scripture enumerate all of them?
To teach their different peculiarities; viz., the horn--to distinguish
between a vicious and a non-vicious one; the tooth and foot--to exempt
them from liability if the damage was done on public ground (for it is
written, Ex. xxii. 4, "and they feed in *another* man's field," but not
on public ground); the pit--to exempt it from liability if vessels fell
into it (and were damaged); the man--to make him liable to pay for the
four things (which is not so in the case of the others); fire--to exempt
it from liability if it consumed concealed articles (as

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *e.g.*, if
articles were concealed in a stack of grain, in which case the liability
is only for the grain, but not for the articles).

"*The one thing, common to them all*," etc. What does this mean to
include? (As from the statement it seems to include all other things the
nature of which is to do damage, and one is charged with taking care of
them, what other such things can there be?) Said Rabhina: "It means to
include that which we have learned in the following Mishna: 'If notice
be given to one to remove (within a certain time usually given by a Beth
Din) a wall, or to cut a certain tree, (and he failing so to do within
such time) they fall, he is liable.'" How is the case? If he renounced
his ownership of them, then according to both Rabh and Samuel it is like
the case of the pit; as a pit because it does often damage one must take
care of it, so also is the case here. <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md)
If he has not renounced ownership, then, according to Samuel who says
that they are all deduced from the pit, are they the same as the pit?
Nay, the case is that he has renounced ownership, but lest one say that
they are not like the pit which is originally made to do damage, which
is not the case with the above things (the building of a wall or the
planting of a tree), then the case of the ox proves that; and lest one
say that the ox is different because of its usual way of doing damage
with its feet, then again the case of the pit may prove and so the
conclusion will return (and the original argument is reinstated).

"*To pay the damages*." The rabbis taught: It is written \[Ex. xxii.
4\]: "With the best of his own field, and with the best of his own
vineyard shall he make restitution." That means the best field and the
best vineyard of the plaintiff (*e.g.*, if A's ox grazed upon a parcel
of land belonging to B, the best land of B is taken as a standard, and A
must pay an amount of damages equal to the difference in value of such a
parcel of land before and after having been grazed upon). Such is the
dictum of R. Ishmael; R. Aqiba, however, said: "The passage intends to
state only that damages are collected from the best estates of the
defendant (*i.e.*, the parcel of land of the plaintiff is appraised, and
if the defendant wishes to pay in land he must do so with land of his
own best estates), and so much the more in case of damages to
consecrated articles. Is it possible that according

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

to R. Ishmael restitution must be made with the best land even if land
of an inferior quality be damaged? Said R. A'ha bar Jacob: "The case
treated of here is that the best land of the plaintiff was of the same
quality as the worst land of the defendant, and they differ on this
point. R. Ishmael holds that the land of the plaintiff is taken as a
standard, and the passage stating that he shall pay from the best
estates, means from the best estates of the plaintiff, and R. Aqiba
holds that that of the defendant is taken as a standard for best."

What is the reason of R. Ishmael's statement? The word "field" is
written below (with the best of his own *field*) and also above (and
they feed in another man's *field*) (ibid., ibid.); as above it has
reference to the land of the plaintiff, so also in the statement below
(and the passage is to be expounded thus: When the defendant has land
which equals the best of the plaintiff's, he must pay out of such land
the amount of the damage). And R. Aqiba? He may say, it is written:
"With the best of his own fields, etc., he shall make restitution." That
means not that of the plaintiff (and no deduction by analogy is
admissible when the statement is so plain). R. Ishmael, however, may
say: In this case we must derive the benefit of both the analogy of
expression and the passages; the analogy of expression as I have
explained, and the benefit from the passage I derive for explaining that
it refers to a case where the defendant has both best and worst land,
and the plaintiff has only best land, and the worst land of the
defendant is inferior to the best of the plaintiff, in which case he
cannot say to the plaintiff, collect your damages from my worst (because
the passage gives the benefit to the plaintiff to be paid from the
best), and therefore. he must make restitution from his own *best*
estates.

Abayi propounded the contradiction of the following passages to Rabha:
It is written \[ibid., ibid.\]: "With the *best* of his own fields,"
etc., which means from the best estates only and with nothing else, and
we have learned in another Boraitha: "It is written \[Ex. xxi. 34\]:
'And to return money (make restitution)'; means this to include
*equivalents of money, even bran?*" (Rabha answered): This presents no
difficulty. When he returns of his own will he may give even bran, but
if through the court he pays from the best estates. Said Ula, the son of
R. Ilai: "The wording of the passage seems to lead to the same

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

conclusion, for it is written 'shall he make restitution,' which
signifies *involuntarily*." Said Abayi to him: "Is it then written
'restitution shall be made'?" (which would mean involuntarily). It is
written "*he shall* make," etc., which can also mean voluntarily. When
R. Papa and R. Huna, the son of R. Jehoshua, returned from the college
they explained the above passage as follows: "Anything (of personal
property) is considered as the best of estates, for if he cannot sell it
(at a reasonable price) at one place, he can take it to another place
(and therefore if he makes restitution with personal property he may do
so even with bran); except (if he makes restitution with) land, he must
do so only with the best estates in order to enable him to procure a
buyer."

R. Samuel bar Abba of Akkrunia propounded the following question to R.
Abba: When the standard (as to which are the best and which are the
worst lands) is taken, is it taken of those lands of his own, or of
those of the public in general? (*i.e.*, has the defendant to make
restitution out of his *own* best estates, and if his worst lands are as
good as the best of the public in general, must he nevertheless pay out
of his *own* best, or if his worst lands are as good as those of the
public in general, may he make restitution out of his worst lands?--for
they are as good as those of the public in general). According to R.
Ishmael this is no question, for he says that those of the defendant are
taken as a standard (and therefore if his worst are as good as those of
the plaintiff he pays out of his worst estates), but the question is
only according to R. Aqiba, who holds that those of the defendant are to
be taken as a standard. How is it? Shall we assume that the passage "the
best of his own fields" means to exclude the lands of the plaintiff, or
it means to exclude the lands of the public in general? And he answered
him: The Scripture states expressly "of his *own* land," and you ask
whether the land of the public in general is taken as a standard? R.
Samuel objected: We have learned (in case there are to be collected a
woman's claim under her marriage contract \[Kethubah\], damages, and
other debts): If one has only good lands, all the claims are collected
from the good lands; if he has only medium lands, all are collected from
those lands; if only poor-quality lands, all are collected from those
lands; if he has all the three, damages are collected from the good;
ordinary creditors collect from the medium; the Kethubah is collected
from the poor-quality lands; if he has good and medium land only,

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

damages are collected from the good; ordinary debts and the claim of his
wife are collected from the medium lands; if he has medium and
poor-quality lands only, damages and ordinary debts from the medium and
the wife's claim from the poor-quality lands; if he has only good and
poor land, damages from the good and the other two from the poor-quality
land. Now, we see that the middle part of this Boraitha states "that if
he had medium and poor land, damages and ordinary debts are collected
from the medium and the other two from the poor land," and if it is as
you say, that his own lands are taken as a standard, let the medium he
has be considered the best (as they are *his* best), and the creditors
shall be referred to the poor lands? Therefore said Rabhina: They differ
as to the statement of Ula. For Ula said: "According to the Scripture
the creditors are paid out of the poorest, for it is written \[Deut.
xxiv. 11\]: 'In the street shalt thou stand, and the man to whom thou
dost lend shall bring out unto thee the pledge into the street.' Now if
it depends on the will of the debtor, he usually brings out the poorest
article he possesses as a pledge; but why have the sages enacted that
creditors shall be paid out of the medium? In order not to close the
door to the borrowers." The one master holds of Ula's enactment, the
other one does not (but adheres strictly to the meaning of the passage).

The rabbis taught: "(One who had to pay damages, ordinary debts, and the
wife's claim), if he convey all his estates (the good, medium, and poor)
to one person, or to three different persons at the same time, they pass
to the grantees subject to the same liabilities as if in the hands of
the grantors (*i.e.*, the one who bought the good pays off the damages,
the one who bought the medium pays off the creditors, etc.). If at
different times, all are paid from the estate sold last (for the buyers
of the prior estates may each say: When I bought my land there were
other lands from which to pay). If this estate is not sufficient, the
last but one is resorted to; if still insufficient, the last but two is
resorted to." How is the case, if he conveyed to one person? Shall we
assume that he conveyed them by one deed, then surely they pass subject
to the original liability, for even if he sold them to three persons, in
which case one must have priority, you say that they pass subject to
such liabilities, still more so if he sold to one? (what was the
necessity of stating it?) Therefore we must say that it means that they
were conveyed one after another (on three different days), and

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

why does he state three? To teach that although each one of them may
say: "I left room enough for payment," the same thing may be said even
if sold to one. He will say on each parcel of land: When I bought this
parcel of land there were other parcels out of which to pay. The case
here is that the good lands were the last to be sold (in which case it
is more advantageous for him to let them collect according to their
rights than to advance the argument that he left room for payment). So
also said R. Shesheth. If so, shall they all collect of the good lands?
(for at the time the first two estates were sold all the liability
shifted over to the best lands). The grantee may tell them: "If you will
be quiet and collect according to your original rights well and good,
but if not I will return the deed for the sale of the poor land to the
grantor (and then the liability will shift over to those lands, for no
claims are collected from conveyed lands when there are free lands), and
all of you will have to collect your claims from the poor land."

It is certain that when the grantee conveyed the medium and the poor
lands, and left the best for himself, that they all collected their
claims from the best lands, for those were the only ones which remained,
and the others were no more in his possession so that he could refer to
them saying, "I do not care for the enactment of the sages (for my
benefit)" but in case he conveyed the good land and left for himself the
medium and the poor, how is it? (shall the claims be collected from the
second grantee because he took his lands subject to the liability? and
from the first grantee they cannot collect, for he can say he accepts
the enactment of the sages, and the good estates which were at the time
of the first conveyance free were subject to the liability for payment
of the claims?). Abayi intended to decide that all collect from the best
estates. Said Rabha to him: "Did not the first grantee convey to the
second grantee all his rights and interests he may have in them? And
now, if they would come to the first grantee, they could collect from
the medium lands only, and although at the time the medium and poor
lands were conveyed the good ones were still free, he could say, "I do
not want to avail myself of the enactment of the sages"; so also the
second grantee can tell them: "Collect your claims from the medium and
poor lands," for when the second grantee bought the estates he did so
with the intention to acquire all the rights and interest the first
grantee had at the time. R. Huna, however, said: (The above passages,
one mentioning "money" and the other "the

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

best estates," do not contradict each other), it means either money or
best estates. <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)

R. Assi, however, said: "Money is as good as land." For what purpose is
this statement? If for the purpose that it is considered the "best"
(*i.e.*, although he has good land he may pay in money), then it is the
same that R. Huna stated, and it would be sufficient to say "and so also
said R. Assi" Shall we assume that it is for the purpose of teaching as
in the case of two brothers who have divided up land between themselves,
and subsequently a creditor (of their father) comes and levies upon the
share of one of them (that the other may pay his share of contribution
either in land or in money)? Did not R. Assi already state this case?
For it was taught: "Two brothers partitioned their estates and
subsequently a creditor came and levied upon the share of one of them;
Rabh said the partition is thereby annulled (and a new partition must
take place of the lands which remained), because he holds that brothers
in such a case are as heirs. Samuel, however, said that it is valid,
because he holds it is as an ordinary sale and as one who buys without a
responsibility. R. Assi says he (the other brother) must pay his share
of one-fourth in land and one-fourth in money, for he was in doubt
whether they are considered as heirs, and he must contribute his share
in land and not in money, or as an ordinary sale with responsibility,
and he must pay to him what he lost, but in money, and therefore he must
pay one-fourth in money and one-fourth in land), therefore he must pay
one-fourth in land and one-fourth in money. But what is meant by the
statement "it is as good as land"? that it is considered "best"? then it
is again the same statement made by R. Huna? Say: "And so also said R.
Assi."

R. Zera in the name of R. Huna said: In case one does a meritorious
thing he shall do it up to one-third. What does this mean? Shall we
assume that it means up to one-third of his own property? If so, then if
he has occasion to perform three meritorious things he must spend his
whole property? Said R. Zera: It means up to one-third in endeavoring to
adorn the meritorious thing (*e.g.*, if there are two scrolls of Law,
and one is more expensive than the other, he shall spend one-third more
to buy the more expensive one). R. Assi questioned:

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Does it mean
one-third of the cheaper one, or does it mean one-third should be added?
This question remains unanswered. In the West it was said in the name of
R. Zera: Up to one-third he shall spend from his own (without
expectation to be rewarded in this world), thenceforward from the Holy
One's, blessed be He (*i.e.*, that part will be repaid to him in this
world).

MISHNA *II*.: (The following is the rule:) In all that which I am
charged with taking care of I have prepared the damage (*i.e.*, if
damage was done it is considered that I was instrumental in doing it).
If I prepare only a part of the damage I am responsible nevertheless for
the whole, as if I prepared the whole. And only as to property which
cannot be desecrated (but for that which is desecrated there is no
responsibility), or property of persons governed by laws adopted by
their community, <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) or such that has an
owner, and at any place (the damage was done), except if done on the
ground exclusively belonging to the defendant, or on that belonging to
both together, the defendant and the plaintiff. If damage was done, the
defendant must complete the payment of the damages with the best of his
estates.

GEMARA: The rabbis taught: "In all that which I am charged with taking
care of," etc. How so? If one intrusts a deaf man, a fool, or a minor
with the charge over a pit, or an ox, and they cause damage he must pay
for such damage, which is not so in case of fire (explained further on).
What case is treated of here? when the ox was kept on a rope, or the pit
was covered, equivalent to which in case of fire is as if it were live
coals; and if you should ask why there should be a difference (between
the former and the latter), (it may be said) in the case of the ox he is
likely to get loosened, and in the case of a pit the cover is likely to
slip off (and therefore the owner should have that in mind and bestow
better care), but in the case of coal it is the reverse, for it is
likely to get more and more extinguished. But according to R. Johanan,
who said (elsewhere) that if one intrusts even a flame (to those stated
above) he is also free (and consequently the statement above, "which is
not so in case of fire," must be explained as meaning a flame), and in
such a case the equivalent thereof here would be a loosened ox and an
uncovered pit. Why should there be a

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

difference? There (in case of fire) the deaf man has so closely
connected himself with the fire (*i.e.*, if he would not move it, it
would remain stationary), that it is considered that he himself has done
the damage (this is according to Rashi's second explanation, and it is
stated elsewhere that if a deaf man, etc., do damage there is no
liability), but here it is not so (for the ox or the pit did the damage
without the aid of those mentioned).

The rabbis taught: There is a more rigorous rule in the case of the ox
than in the cases of the pit and the fire, and *vice versa*. (How so?)
The rigorousness of the rule in case of the ox is that he (the owner)
pays the atoning money (when the ox kills a free man, and 30 shekels if
a slave) which is not so in the case of the pit and fire. The
rigorousness of the rule in the cases of the pit and the fire is that
the pit is originally made to do damage, and the fire is considered
"noxious from the beginning," which is not so in case of the ox. There
is a more rigorous rule in the case of fire than in the case of the pit,
and *vice versa*. The rigorousness of the rule in case of the pit, which
is made originally to do damage, lies in that one is responsible if he
intrusted it to a deaf man, minor, or fool, which is not so in case of
fire, and the more rigorousness is in the case of fire, which has in its
nature to move and to do damage, and is considered noxious in that it
consumes everything whether fit or unfit for it, which is not so in the
case of the pit. Let him also teach that the case of the ox is more
rigorous because he is liable for damages to vessels (by breaking them
intentionally either with the horn or with the foot), which is not so
with the pit. The Tana enumerates some and leaves out others. Is then
anything else left out that also *this* is left out? Yea, the case of
concealed articles (*e.g.*, if an ox has kicked upon a sack containing
vessels, or an ox carrying a sack containing vessels fell into a pit and
the vessels broke, the owner is responsible for the vessels, which is
not so in case of fire).

"*If I have prepared a part of the damage*," etc. The rabbis taught:
"How so? If one dug a pit nine spans deep and another one came and
completed it to be ten spans deep, the latter is responsible (whether
the ox falling into it was killed or only injured). Shall we assume that
this is not according to Rabbi (who said further on that for damages
both are liable)? Said R. Papa: The case is that the ox that fell in was
killed (in which case Rabbi also agrees that the one who dug the last
span must pay). R. Zera opposed: Is this the only case--is it not

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

the same if one left his ox in charge of five persons, and one of them
left intentionally and the ox caused damage--is the, one who left
responsible? And R. Shesheth also opposed, saying that there is another
case when one added fuel to a burning fire, and the latter caused
damage; the last one is responsible, and R. Papa himself opposed, saying
there is also another case of the following Boraitha when five persons
sit on a bench, and it does not break, and another one comes and sits
down and it breaks, the last one is responsible (for the whole damage);
and he himself explained it as it had been, Papa bar Abba (who was a
heavy-weight man). Now, let us then see; in all those three cases how is
it to be understood? If without the last one no damage would have been
caused, then is it self-evident that he is responsible? And if even
without him damage would have been caused, then what has he done that
makes him liable? (and therefore these illustrations cannot be cited,
because in the, case of the pit the one who dug it nine spans can say to
the other: If you had not dug the tenth span the animal would not have
been killed (as there is a tradition that a pit less than ten spans deep
cannot kill), but only injured, and I would have had to pay only for the
injury, but not for the whole animal). But finally how is this Boraitha,
after all, to be explained? (for the former two cases which are not
Boraithas we do not care). It can be said that if he would not have sat
down it would have not broken before the lapse of two hours, and he
hastened it to break in one hour, in which case the first five can say
to the last one: "If not for you, we would have remained sitting a
little longer, and would have left (and the bench would not have
broken)." But why should he not reverse the argument and say: "If you
were not with me on the bench, it would not have broken at all?" The
case is that it broke while he was leaning on them. What is the
difference? Lest one should say that, as he caused the damage only by
his strength (leaning) and not by sitting down, he should not be liable,
he comes to teach us that one's strength is equivalent to one's weight
of body.

"*I am responsible to pay the whole damage*." It does not state "I am
responsible for the damage," but "I am responsible to complete the
compensation for the damage"; this is a support to what was taught by
the rabbis: "The completion of the compensation for the damage." This is
to teach that the plaintiff must trouble himself with the disposal of
the carcass.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Whence do we
deduce it? Said R. Ami: It is written \[Lev. xxiv. 21\]: "And he that
killeth a beast shall make restitution for it" (yeshalmenah). Do not
read "yeshalmenah," but read "yashlimenah," he shall complete her
(*i.e.*, the plaintiff shall take the final trouble of disposing of it
by sale and the defendant shall pay the balance of the damage). Hezkyah
says, it can be deduced from the following passage \[Ex. xxi. 34\]: "And
the dead beast shall be his," which signifies it shall be that of the
plaintiff. So it was explained by the disciples of Hezkyah. "Thou sayest
it belongs to the plaintiff perhaps the passage means that it belongs to
the defendant? It was said: "It was not so." What does that mean? Said
Abayi: If thou shouldst think that the carcass belongs to the defendant,
it should have been written "an ox for an ox" \[ibid., ibid.\], and no
more (and I would know that the defendant can have the carcass); why the
addition of the above passage? Infer here from that the passage means
that it shall remain the plaintiff's. Said R. Kahana to Rabh: Is that
so, that without the addition of that passage it could be thought that
it belongs to the defendant? Where is the common sense? Since if he (the
defendant) has a number of carcasses he may give them to the other party
(in payment of the damages), for the master said above: It is written
\[ibid.\] "He shall '*return*'; that includes equivalents of money, and
even bran." The more so the carcass in question, which is his own? This
statement (as to who has to trouble himself with the disposal of the
carcass) was necessary as to the loss in value of the carcass (*i.e.*,
that from the time the animal was killed its owner is charged with its
disposal, and if through his negligence it was not disposed of, and
there resulted a loss in value, that loss is charged to the plaintiff).

Shall we assume that the Tanaim of the following Boraitha differ as to
this case? It is written \[ibid. xxii. 12\]: "If it be torn in pieces
let him bring it in evidence that it happened so by accident, and he
will not be liable" (for a bailee for hire is not responsible for
accident). Abba Saul, however, says it means he shall bring the carcass
into court (to be appraised). May we not suppose that they differ thus
(for we cannot suppose that they differ in case it was done by accident,
for even Abba Saul must concede that a bailee for hire is not
responsible in such a case, but they probably differ in a case where the
bailee *is* liable): One holds that the loss in value is chargeable to
the plaintiff, and the other holds that it is chargeable to the
defendant?

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

Nay, both agree that it is chargeable to the plaintiff, but they differ
as to the trouble of transportation of the carcass.

As we have learned in the following Boraitha: The anonymous teachers
say: Whence do we deduce that the owner of the pit has to bring up the
killed ox from the pit (at his expense)? It is written \[ibid. xxi.
34\]: "He shall make restitution in money unto the owner thereof; and
the dead" (*i.e.*, he must give also the carcass, which cannot be done
unless brought up from the pit). Said Abayi to Rabha: "How is this case
of transportation of the carcass? Shall we assume that when in the pit
it is worth one Zuz and when on the brink thereof it is worth four? Then
this trouble is for his own benefit? Why the passages?" He answered him:
"The case is that it is in either case not worth more than one Zuz" (and
even then he must bring it up). But can there ever happen such a case?
Yea, as people usually say: "A beam in the forest is worth one Zuz, and
the same, although, in the city, is also only of same value."

Samuel said: "(It is the custom of the courts that) no appraisement is
made for a thief or robber (*i.e.*, if one stole an article, etc., and
the same was broken, he does not return the broken parts and pay the
difference in value, but must return good articles), but only in case of
damages. And I, however, add also the borrower, and Aba (Rabh) agrees
with me."

It was taught: Ula said in the name of R. Elazar: An appraisement is
made for a thief and a robber. R. Papi, however, said: No appraisement
is made. And the Halakha prevails that no appraisement is made for a
thief and robber; but for a borrower, however, it may be made, according
to R. Kahana and R. Assi. Ula said again in the name of R. Elazar: "A
firstborn (of a man) which was killed by an animal within the thirty
days need not be redeemed." So also has Rami bar Hama taught: Because it
is written \[Numb. xviii. 15\] "thou shalt redeem" one might think that
this were so even if it were killed within the thirty days; therefore it
is written \[ibid., ibid.\] "nevertheless" <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) to distinguish (that in case it was killed
it need not).

The same said again in the name of the same authority: "Of brothers who
have divided up (their estates of inheritance), that wearing apparel
which they have on is appraised, but that which their sons and daughters
have on is not appraised, because

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

they have no case in court, and therefore we do not trouble them to
come." Said R. Papa: "Sometimes, however, even what they have on is also
not appraised; this may be the case if the eldest brother was the
manager of the estates, and he was dressed in better clothes for
business purposes."

The same said again in the name of the same authority: The Halakha
prevails that debts are collected from slaves (because they are
considered as real property). Said R. Na'hman to Ula: Did R. Elazar say
so even when the slaves fall inheritance to orphans? Nay, only from him.
From him? Would you say even from the only garment he has on? The case
here is that he has hypothecated the slave, as Rabha said: "If one
hypothecates his slave and thereafter sells him, the creditors
nevertheless replevy the slave. If he has, however, hypothecated his ox,
and thereafter sold him, the creditor cannot replevy him. Why so?
Because when a slave is hypothecated people talk about it, and therefore
the vendee is charged with notice, which is not the case with an ox."
After R. Na'hman left, Ula said to those present: "So said R. Elazar:
'Even from the orphans (for a slave is as real estate).'" Said R.
Na'hman (when he heard of this): "Ula avoided me (to state that in my
presence, for fear I would cut him off with numerous objections)." Such
a case happened in Nahardea and her judges collected a debt (from the
slaves which fell an inheritance to orphans). In Pumbeditha such a case
happened, and R. Hana bar Bizna collected it. Said R. Na'hman to them:
"Go and return it, and if not I will collect it from your property."
Said Rabha to R. Na'hman: "Ula, R. Elazar, the judges of Nahardea, and
R. Hana bar Bizna are all your opponents; according to whom then is your
decision?" He answered: "I know a Boraitha, which was taught by Abimi:
"A premonition (πρεοβολη) is effective as to land, but not as to slaves;
personal property passes with land (if personal property is sold with
land, and only the land is taken possession of, the personal property
also passes), but not with slaves." (Hence we see that slaves are
considered personal property.) Shall we assume that the Tanaim of the
following Boraithas differ as to this case: If one sold slaves and land,
and the vendee took possession of the slaves, the land does not pass.
The same is the case if *vice versa*. Land and personal property, if the
vendee took possession of the land, the personal property passes, but
not *vice versa*. Slaves and personal property do not pass, unless the
vendee takes possession

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

of both of them, as one does not pass with the other. In another
Boraitha it was taught that if one takes possession of the slaves the
personal property sold therewith passes. Shall we not assume that they
differ in this: One holds that slaves are considered real, and the other
holds that they are personal property? Said R. Ika, the son of R. Ami:
"Nay, all agree that a slave is personal property, and that Boraitha
which states that it does not pass is correct, and that Boraitha that
states that it does pass, treats of a case where the clothes which are
on the body of the slave were sold." \[And even when so, what of it? Is
this then not considered a moving court, and with a moving court
(personal property) does not pass? And if you should say that he was
then not moving, did not Rabha say (Baba Metzia, Chap. I.) that if it
does not pass when moving, it does not do so also when standing or
sitting?\] The Halakha prevails that it passes only when the slave is
tied and cannot move.

But have we not learned in another Boraitha that if he takes possession
of the land the slaves also pass? There is the case that the slaves are
standing upon it. Would you say that the Boraitha which states that they
do not pass means that they do not stand upon it? This would be correct
according to the one who says that slaves are considered personal
property, and therefore if they stand upon it they do, and if not they
do not pass; but according to the one who says that slaves are as real
property, why is it necessary that they should stand upon it? Did not
Samuel say that if one convey to another ten different parcels of land
located in as many different states, the taking possession of one of
them acquires title to all? (Says the Gemara: What a question is this?)
Even according to the opinion of him who says that slaves are considered
personal estates, why is it needed that they should stand upon it? Have
we not the tradition that if personal property be sold with real
property, the former need not be upon the latter when possession is
taken of the latter? What answer can you give to this, that there is a
difference between personal estates that *are* movable and those that
*are not*? Say the same thing here: There is a difference between
movable and immovable real estate. Slaves are considered movable real
estate, the body of the earth is one wherever it is (consequently all
his lands are attached to each other).

"*Property which cannot be desecrated*," etc. R. Abba said: "An ox
intended to be sacrificed as a peace-offering, which has

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

done damage, the (half) damage is paid out of his meat, but not out of
those pieces prepared for the altar." Is that not self-evident, for
those pieces are for the Lord? It means to teach that the value of the
half of these pieces is not collected from the other half of the flesh
(*e.g.*, a non-vicious ox consecrated for a peace-offering, of the value
of two hundred Zuz when slaughtered, that has killed another ox of the
same value when alive, in which case according to law he must pay the
damage out of half of his body. Now the pieces being burnt the value of
the half body is diminished, nevertheless the amount diminished cannot
be collected from the other half of the body). According to whom is
this? According to the rabbis, (who hold in case one ox has pushed
another ox into a pit) that only the owner of the ox has to pay, but not
the owner of the pit (although it is not sufficient); then this is
self-evident. If it is according to R. Nathan, who in the above case
holds that the owner of the pit must complete it, why should in this
case the parts sacrificed be exempt? This can be according to both R.
Nathan and the rabbis; according to the rabbis, because we might say
that the rabbis held so only where there are two distinct elements (the
ox and the pit), but in this case where there is only one body, the
plaintiff may say: I will collect my damage from any part I wish. And
according to R. Nathan: In that case the owner of the ox may say to the
owner of the pit: I found the ox in thy pit; whatever I cannot collect
from that party, I will collect from thee. But in the case herein can he
then say the flesh has done the damage, but not those pieces in
question? (Hence the statement.)

"*And that property that has owners*." What does this mean to exclude?
We have learned in a Boraitha, this means to exclude ownerless property.
How is the case? If our ox gore an ownerless ox, who claims damages? If
the reverse is the case, let him go and take the ox? The case is that
(after he has done the damage) he was appropriated by some one. Rabhina
said: "This means to exclude the case where he first did the damage, and
then was consecrated by his owner, or declared ownerless (by driving him
out)." So also we have learned in a Boraitha: "Further than that said R.
Jehudah: Even if he damaged and then was consecrated, or his owner
declared him ownerless he is exempt, as it is written \[Ex. xxi. 29\],
'and warning have been given to his owner, and he killeth a man or a
woman,' etc., which signifies that during the killing, the bringing

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

of the suit and the making of the award there shall be one and the same
owner."

"*Except on the property of the defendant*." For he can say to him: What
has your ox to do on my premises?

"*And on the property of both the defendant and the plaintiff*." Said R.
Hisda in the name of Abimi: In a partnership court one partner is liable
to the other partner for damages done by the tooth and foot, and our
Mishna is to be explained thus: "Except on property exclusively
belonging to the defendant, where he is free, but on premises belonging
to both the defendant and the plaintiff, if damage is done, the one
doing it is liable." R. Elazar, however, makes them free and explains
the Mishna that there is no liability for foot and tooth when it belongs
to the plaintiff or to both the defendant and the plaintiff, and what is
stated further on of one's liability refers to damage done by the horn,
because partnership property is for that purpose considered a public
ground. It is right according to Samuel (*ante*, p. [5](#page_5).md), but
according to Rabh, who says that the expression "ox" in the Mishna
includes everything in relation thereto, what does this mean to include?
It means to include that which the rabbis taught: "If damage is done the
defendant is responsible." This means to include the depositary, the
loan for use, the loan for hire, and the bailor for hire; if an animal
has done damage on their ground, a non-vicious ox pays half and a
vicious ox pays the full amount of damages. If the enclosure wall in
good condition broke in in the night time, or it was broken in by
burglars and (the animal) went out and has done damage, there is no
liability." How was the case? Shall we assume that the ox of the bailor
for hire has injured the ox of the bailee, let the bailor say to the
bailee: If he should damage some stranger's property you would have to
pay (because you are charged with taking care of him); why should I pay
you when he has injured your ox? And if the reverse were the case (and
still it is said that only one-half is paid), let the owner say to the
bailee: If he were injured by an ox of a third person would you not have
to pay me the full amount of damage? (because in the case of a loan for
use he is liable for damages occurring by accident), now when *your own*
ox has caused the injury you want to pay me only one-half? The case is
that the ox of the bailor has injured the ox of the bailee, and the
objection just stated can be explained that the bailee has agreed to
take care that the ox shall not *be injured*, but not that he shall *do
no injury to others*.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

If so, how will be explained the later part which states that if the
wall was broken in in the night-time, or the same was broken in by
burglars, and the animal went out and did damage, he is free, from which
is to be inferred that if in the daytime there is liability. Why should
it be so? Did he then warrant against his injury to others? The Boraitha
meant thus: If he has warranted against his injury to others he is
liable only in the daytime, but not if in the night-time or by accident.
Is that so? Has not R. Joseph taught: "In a partnership court and an
inn, one is liable for damages done by the tooth and the foot?" Is this
not contrary to the statement of R. Elazar? R. Elazar might answer: Do
not the Boraithas themselves contradict each other? Have we not learned
in another Boraitha: R. Simeon b. Elazar laid down four rules in regard
to damages: "If done on ground exclusively belonging to the plaintiff
and not to the defendant, the liability is for the whole (even if done
by the horn and in case of a non-vicious animal); if *vice versa* there
is no liability at all; if on ground belonging to both, as *e.g.* a
partnership courtyard or valley, there is no liability for the foot and
tooth, but for goring, pushing, biting, lying upon, and kicking, a
non-vicious pays one-half and a vicious pays the whole. If on ground
belonging to neither of them, as, for instance, a courtyard belonging to
neither of them, there is a liability for the tooth and foot; for goring
and biting, pushing and lying upon and kicking, a non-vicious ox pays
one-half and a vicious pays the whole damage." Hence, we see that it is
stated that in a partnership courtyard or a valley there is no liability
for the tooth and the foot, and hence do the two Boraithas contradict
each other. That one (which says there is no liability) treats of a
courtyard which is held in partnership for both storing fruit and
keeping oxen (in which case it is considered a partnership courtyard as
to both the foot and the horn), and therefore in case of the tooth he is
free, and in case of the horn he pays half, as it is equal to public
ground; and that Boraitha taught by R. Joseph treats of a court held in
partnership only as to fruit, but not as to oxen, in which case as to
the tooth it is considered the exclusive ground of the plaintiff. It
seems to be so also from the difference used in the wording of the
Boraithas. In one case things similar to an inn (which is not used for
oxen), and in the other-those similar to a valley (where generally oxen
are pastured) are stated. Infer herefrom. R. Zera opposed: If there was
a partnership for fruit, can it be called *another man's* field,

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

as required by Ex. xxii. 4? Said Abayi to him: "So long as it is not
partnership as to oxen *it is* considered *another man's* field."

MISHNA *III*.: Damages are assessed in money, and are collected from
what has a value of money; and it must be done before the court, and
only on testimony of witnesses who are freemen, and they must be members
of a community who have adopted a set of laws for their government; and
women are on the same footing with men as to damages; both the defendant
and the plaintiff must contribute (sometimes) toward the payment of the
damages. (The whole Mishna will be explained further on in the Gemara.)

GEMARA: What is the meaning of "assessing in money"? Said R. Jehudah: It
means the assessment shall be made by the Beth Din in money only, and
this is explained in the following Tosephtha which the rabbis taught:
"If a cow has damaged a garment (on the ground belonging to the owner
thereof), and subsequently the garment of same owner lying on public
ground was trod upon by the cow, and was damaged, it is not said,
because each party is entitled to damage from the other, that both shall
be relieved from paying each other at all, but the damages in each case
are separately assessed, and the excess paid to the party due."

"*They are collected only from what is valued in money*." The rabbis
taught: The expression in the Mishna "what is valued in money" teaches
that the Beth Din is not obliged to collect damages unless from real
estates, but if the party entitled to be paid, however, has anticipated
and has seized upon personal property the Beth Din may collect his claim
from that property. How is it so inferred from the Mishna? Said R. Ashi:
The expression "which is valued in money" means to say but real money
itself, and all those things (personal property, slaves, evidences of
debt, etc.) are considered money itself. R. Jehudah bar Hinna propounded
the following contradiction to R. Huna, the son of R. Jehoshua: It
states "what is valued in money"; this teaches that the Beth Din is not
obliged to collect unless from real estates; and another Boraitha
states: It is written \[Ex. xxi. 34\]: "(he shall give) unto the owner,"
which includes even equivalents of money, and even bran? (Hence a
contradiction?) The case treated of here is that if they are to be
collected from orphans' estates, for damages due from their deceased
father, in which case they are to be collected from realty

only. If it is from orphans, what does the last part state-that if the
party has seized personal property the Beth Din may collect therefrom?
The case is as Rabha said in the name of R. Na'hman elsewhere, that he
made the seizure during the lifetime of the father, so also is the case
here.

"*On testimony of witnesses*." This is to exclude the case when one
admits his guilt, and thereafter witnesses appear, so that he is no more
liable to pay a fine. This is correct according to the one who holds
that if one admits his guilt and thereafter witnesses appear that he is
no more liable to fine, but according to the one who says that in such a
case he is, what does the statement in the Mishna mean to exclude? It is
needed in regard to the latter part, which states that the witnesses
must be freemen, to exclude slaves.

"*And the women are on the same footing*," etc. Wherefrom is this
deduced? In the schools of Hezkiah and R. Jose the Galilean it was
taught: It is written \[ibid. xxi. 28\]: "If an ox gore a man *or a
woman*"; this signifies that the Scripture made equal a woman and a man
in respect to all crimes which are mentioned in the Scripture.

It was taught: The one-half damage paid (in case of a non-vicious ox);
R. Papa said damages, because he is of the opinion that usually oxen
require particular care and according to the law he would have to pay
the whole damage, but as that happened only once the Scripture had pity
with him and remitted one-half, and R. Huna the son of R. Jehoshua holds
that it is a fine, because he is of the opinion that oxen usually are
considered guarded and according to the law he would have to pay nothing
at all, but the Scripture nevertheless fined him in order that he should
take particular care. An objection was raised, based upon the Mishna.
Both the plaintiff and the defendant sometimes contribute toward the
payment of the damage. It is right according to the one who says that
the half damages paid is considered damage; therefore sometimes the
plaintiff must also contribute (*i.e.*, he takes less than he suffered),
but if according to the one who holds that it is a fine, then he takes
what he is not entitled to, how can you say that he is contributing?
This statement is only in regard to loss in value of the carcass. But
this was already stated in the first Mishna, as explained above, "to
complete the damage." Infer that the owners are charged with the
disposal of the corpse? This need be stated twice, once in case of a
vicious and once in case of a

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

non-vicious animal; and it would not suffice to state it only once; for
if it should be stated only in case of a non-vicious animal it would be
argued that it is so because of that fact that he was not vicious, but
in case of a vicious animal I would say it is not so; and if it would be
stated only in case of a vicious animal, it could be said that it is so
because the full amount of damage is paid, but in the case of a
non-vicious animal it is not so, hence the necessity of stating it
twice.

(An objection was made.) Come and hear: "The following is the rule: All
those who pay more than actual (punitive) damage (*e.g.*, in case of
killing a slave where thirty shekels are to be paid) do not pay so on
their own admission (but it must be proved by other evidence). Is it not
to be inferred herefrom that in case of paying less (than actual
damages), one does pay so on his own admission? Nay, this means in case
where the whole damage is paid. But how is it in case of paying less--is
the same the case? Then why should it state, the rule is that all those
who pay *more*," etc.; why not state, the rule is that all those who pay
damages not according to the actual amount of damage done," which would
make it clear as to those who pay more as well as to those who pay less?
This objection remains, and the Halakha, however, prevails that the half
damage is a fine. Can there be a settled Halakha in spite of an
objection? Yea, for what is the reason of raising the objection, because
it does not teach, "as much as they have damaged"? It could not state so
because there is the half damage in case of raking up gravel, which is
Mosaic that it is damage and not fine. Now, when the conclusion arrived
at is that the half damage is a fine, when a dog consumes a sheep or a
cat consumes a hen, it is unusual (and therefore considered the
derivative of the horn and pays only one-half damage); such a damage is
not collected in Babylon, where fines are not collected. But this is so
only where those killed were big ones, but in case they were small ones
it is usual, and it is to be collected in Babylon also; but if the
plaintiff has seized upon the property belonging to the defendant (even
in the former case), we do not compel him to surrender it, and also if
he says: "Fix me a time to go to Palestine," his request maybe granted.
And if he does not go he is put under the ban. In either case we place
him under the ban until the tort-feasors are removed, as stated further
on (end Chapter IV.), in the name of R. Nathan.

MISHNA *IV*.: There are five cases which are considered

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

non-vicious and five which are considered vicious. A domestic animal is
considered non-vicious to gore, to push, to bite, to lie upon, or to
kick; the tooth (of an animal) is considered vicious to consume that
which is fit for it; the foot is considered vicious to break everything
on its way while walking; the vicious ox; the ox doing damage on the
estates belonging to the plaintiff exclusively; and a man. The wolf, the
lion, the bear, the leopard, and the *bardalis* and the serpent are
considered vicious. R. Elazar says: When they are domesticated they are
not, with the exception of the serpent, which is under all circumstances
vicious.

GEMARA: From the teaching of the Mishna that "the tooth is considered
vicious to consume," it must be inferred that the case is when the
damage was done on the ground belonging to the plaintiff, and it is
nevertheless taught "the animal is not vicious," which means not to pay
the whole, but to pay half, and this is according to the rabbis, who say
that the horn doing damage on the estate of the plaintiff is considered
unusual, and pays only one-half of the damage; then according to whom
would be the latter part? "The vicious ox and the ox doing damage on the
estate of the plaintiff and the man," which means that they pay the
whole damage, according to R. Tarphon, who says that the horn, although
it is unusual for it to do damage on the premises of the plaintiff,
still pays the whole. Then the first part of the Mishna will be
according to the rabbis, and the latter part according to R. Tarphon?
Yea, so it is, as Samuel said to R. Jehudah: Genius, do not trouble
yourself about the explanation of our Mishna, and follow my theory that
the first part is in accordance with the rabbis and the latter part is
in accordance with R. Tarphon. R. Elazar in the name of Rabh, however,
said that both parts are according to R. Tarphon, but the first part
treats of a court that was separated for fruit only to one of the
parties, and for oxen for both of them, and in such a case concerning
"tooth" it is considered the premises of the plaintiff only, and
concerning "horn" it is considered public ground.

Said R. Kahana: I have explained this Halakha to R. Zbid of Nahardea,
and he rejoined: How can both parts of the Mishna be in accordance with
R. Tarphon? Did not the Mishna state, "the tooth is vicious to consume
what is *fit* for it," which signifies that it is vicious only as to
what is fit for it, but not as to what is *unfit* (as then it is like
the horn and pays only half), and R. Tarphon says plainly that even the
horn pays the whole on the premises of the plaintiff?

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

Therefore said Rabhina: "The Mishna is not completed, and ought to read
as follows: There are five cases which are considered non-vicious until
they are declared to be vicious; the tooth, the foot, however, are
considered vicious from the very beginning, and this is called the
vicious ox; as to the ox doing damage on the estate of the plaintiff,
the rabbis and R. Tarphon differ; and there are other vicious animals
similar to those: the wolf, the lion, the bear, the bardalis, the
leopard, and the serpent." So also we have learned plainly in a
Boraitha.

"*And not to lie upon*." Said R. Eliezer: "It is so only when it lies on
large vessels, but if on small ones it is usual, and it comes under the
law applying to the foot."

"*The wolf, the lion, etc., and the bardalis*." What is a bardalis? Said
R. Jehudah: It is a Nephrasa. What is a Nephrasa? Said R. Joseph: It is
an Apa (Hyena). <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) Samuel said if a lion
on public ground had caught an animal and ate it up alive there is no
liability, for it is his usual way to do so, and therefore it is as if
an ox had consumed fruit or herbs in public ground; but if he had first
killed it and then ate it up he is liable, for it is not usual, and it
comes under the law applying to the horn.

MISHNA *V*.: There is no difference between a vicious and a non-vicious
animal, only that a non-vicious pays one-half of the damage, and only
from the (money realized from the sale of the) body of the animal having
done the damage; and a vicious animal pays the whole damage and from the
best estates.

GEMARA: What is meant by "best estates"? said R. Elazar: It means, the
highest of his own estates; and so it is said \[II Chron. xxxii. 33\]:
"And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the *best
place* of the sepulchres," etc., and R. Elazar said, "best" means among
the "highest of his own family"--that is, David and Solomon."

It is written \[ibid. xvi. 14\]: "And they buried him in his sepulchres,
which he had dug for himself in the city of David, and they laid him in
the couch which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices,"
etc. "And all Jehudah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem showed him honor
at his death" \[ibid. xxxii. 33\]. Infer from this that his disciples
were placed on his

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

grave to study the law. R. Nathan and the sages differ as to how long it
continued; one says it lasted three, the others say seven, and still
others say it lasted thirty days.

The rabbis taught (referring to the passage just quoted) that it means
the thirty-six thousand people who preceded the coffin of Hezekiah, the
king of Judah, all their shoulders bared. So said R. Jehudah. Said R.
Ne'hemiah to him: "Was not the same thing done upon the death of Ahab?"
The great honor consisted in that the Holy Scrolls were placed on his
coffin, and it was announced, "*That* one resting in the coffin has
performed all that is written in *these* Scrolls." But do we not do the
same thing at present? At present we only take the Scrolls out, but we
do not place them on the bier, and if you wish you may say that at
present we even place them on the bier, but do not say "that he
performed," etc. Said Rabba bar bar Hana: I was once walking along with
R. Johanan, and he said that at present we say even "he performed,"
etc., but we do not say "he taught" (that which is written in the
Scrolls, which was said at the funeral of Hezekiah). But did not the
master say: "The study of the Law is great because it causes action"?
Hence we see that action has preference over study, and why was it said
of Hezekiah that he "taught"? This presents no difficulty. Over
learning, action has a preference; teaching, however, has preference
over action.

R. Johanan in the name of R. Simeon b. Johai said: "It is written \[Isa.
xxxii. 20\]: 'Happy are ye that sow beside all waters, freely sending
forth the feet of the ox and the ass.'" It means that those who occupy
themselves with the study of the Law and those bestowing favors on
others will be rewarded with the inheritance of two tribes, as it is
written \[ibid., ibid.\]: "Happy are ye that sow," and "sowing" means
nothing else than charity, as it is written \[Hosea x. 12\]: "Sow then
for yourselves after righteousness, that you may reap (the fruit) of
kindness"; and by "water" is meant the Law, as it is written \[Isa. Iv.
1\]: "Ho, every one of ye that thirsteth, come ye to the water" (*i.e.*,
the Torah); "is rewarded with the inheritance," etc., means he overcomes
his enemies as the tribe of Joseph, as it is written \[Deut. xxxiii.
17\]: "With them shall he push nations together to the ends of the
earth," and he acquires understanding as the tribe of Issachar, as it is
written \[I Chron. xii. 32\]: "And of the children of Issachar, those
who had *understanding* of the times to know what Israel ought to do."

<span id="fn_3"></span>[2:2](kam04.htm#fr_3.md) According to the other
explanation of Rashi it is because a human being is provident, *i.e.*
careful, and it is not easy to kill him unless by penetrating his body
with the horns with great force.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[3:1](kam04.htm#fr_4.md) Modern scholars come to the
conclusion that originally the Mishna read ‏המבעיר‎ which means one who
started a fire, instead of ‏המבעה‎ which latter word cannot be found
either in the Scripture or in the Mishna elsewhere, and that this latter
word originates from an error on the part of the transcriber in writing
an ‏ה‎ instead of ‏יר‎. And it seems to us that this view of the
scholars is correct, for we find in one Tosephtha plainly the word
"Hamabir" instead of "Hamabeh." We may add to this that Rabh's
explanation, "It means a man," shows also that "Hamabir" is the correct
word. We have therefore omitted all the citations of the passages to
explain the meaning of the word "Hamabeh," as they are too far-fetched
and were probably added by the expounders of Rabh's statement. Abraham
Krochmal, however, maintains that in the first Mishnayoth it was used
"Hamabir," but Rabbi, the editor of his Mishnayoth, wrote "Hamabeh," for
the reason that this word has two meanings which can be applied to foot
and tooth. (See his Notes on the Talmud, Lemberg, 1831, page 260.)

<span id="fn_5"></span>[8:1](kam04.htm#fr_5.md) This is no contradiction of
what was stated above, that a pit does not do damage often, for it means
that it does not do so as often as the foot, which treads on everything
in its way.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[13:1](kam04.htm#fr_6.md) The reason why this was
not stated till now is that there should be no interruption in the
discussion of R. Ishmael and R. Aqiba.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[14:1](kam04.htm#fr_7.md) This seems to be the true
meaning of the expression "Bene Brith," and not, as some thought, that
it means Israelites. See our introduction to this edition in our
"History of the Talmud."

<span id="fn_8"></span>[18:1](kam04.htm#fr_8.md) According to Leeser's
translation.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[28:1](kam04.htm#fr_9.md) There is a long discussion
in the Talmudical dictionaries as to the correct meaning of bardalis,
which is mentioned in several places in the Talmud and seems to have
different meanings; we translate it "hyena" according to Mr. Sheinhack
in his "Hamashbir."
