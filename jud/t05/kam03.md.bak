### SYNOPSIS OF SUBJECTS

#### OF

# TRACT BABA KAMA (THE FIRST GATE).  <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

### CHAPTER I.

MISHNA *I*. There are four principal cases of tort, etc. One thing is
common to all. They are all likely to do damage and must be guarded
against. The case of doing damage by digging up gravel. The different
explanations of the word "mabeh" by Rabh and Samuel (foot-note). There
are thirteen principal tort-feasors. The depository, <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) etc. There are twenty-four principal
tort-feasors. What are the derivatives of all those principals? Why are
the four principals, ox, excavation, mabeh, and fire, enumerated
separately in the Scripture? From what and what kind of property must
damage be collected? When the standard is taken, is it taken of one's
own lands or of those of the public in general? In order not to close
the door to borrowers, the sages have enacted that creditors should be
paid out of the medium estates. If one conveys his estates to one or
several persons, from whom and from what estates shall the creditors
collect the money due them? In case one does a meritorious thing he
shall do it up to one-third,
[1](kam04.htm#page_1)-[16](kam04.htm#page_16.md)

MISHNAS *II*. TO *V*. In all that I am charged with taking care of I
have prepared the damage. There is a more rigorous rule in case of the
ox than in the cases of the pit and the fire, and *vice versa*. How so?
If one left his ox in charge of five persons, and one of them left
intentionally and the ox caused damage, what is the law? No appraisement
is made for a thief or robber. If one hypothecates his slave or his ox
and thereafter sells him. There is a difference between movable and
immovable real estate. Slaves are considered movable real estate. During
the killing, the bringing of the suit, and the making of the award there
shall be one and the same owner. There are five cases which are
considered non-vicious and

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

five which are considered vicious. The tooth is considered vicious to
consume, etc. What is a Bardalis? What is meant by "best estates"? The
meaning of the verse Is. xxxii. 20,
[16](kam04.htm#page_16)-[29](kam04.htm#page_29.md)

### CHAPTER II.

MISHNAS *I* TO *III*. What tendency makes the foot to be considered
vicious? Cocks that were flying from one place to another, and broke
vessels with their wings. Cocks that were hopping on dough or on fruit,
and made the same dirty, or that were flying and the wind produced by
their wings damaged vessels, or that were pecking at a rope from which a
water-pail was suspended, and, severing the rope, broke the
water-pail--what is the law? The distinction between primary and
secondary force. A dog that snatched and carried off a cake from the
burning coals, and with the burning coal that stuck in the cake set fire
to the barn, etc. There can be viciousness in case of "gravel in the
usual way." If an animal was walking in a place where it was impossible
not to kick up gravel, and she kicked, and by so doing kicked up gravel
and caused damage; or if an animal caused damage by shaking the
tail--what is the law? What tendency makes the tooth to be considered
vicious? It happened that an ass consumed a loaf of bread contained in a
basket and chewed up the basket, etc. If an animal was standing on
private ground and an article was rolling toward the private ground,
etc. About one who takes up his dwelling in the court of his neighbor
without the latter's knowledge. One who rents a house from Reuben must
pay the rent to Simeon, etc. If one uses an unoccupied house of another
for storing wood and straw, etc., what is the law? A certain person
erected a palace on the ruins belonging to orphans, etc. A dog or a goat
that jumps down from the top of a roof and breaks vessels liable for the
whole damage. If, however, they fall down, there is no liability. Is
one's fire considered one's arrow or one's property? There is no
liability for damages done by fire to concealed articles. How can such a
case be found in the biblical law? The mouth of an animal (consuming
something on the premises of the plaintiff), is it considered as if yet
in the court of the plaintiff? There were certain goats belonging to the
family of Tarbu that were doing damage to the property of R. Joseph,
[30](kam05.htm#page_30)-[47](kam05.htm#page_47.md)

MISHNAS *IV*. TO *VI*. What ox is considered non-vicious and what
vicious? One that has been warned for three days. The three days in
question, are they such as to make the ox vicious, or do they also
involve the owner? For one who sets his neighbor's dog on a third
person, what is the law? An ox that gored, pushed, bit, lay down on, or
kicked while on public ground pays half. The *a fortiori* argument
regarding the half-payment of the horn. An ox that steps with his foot
on a child lying on the premises of the plaintiff, what is the law in
regard to the payment of atonement money? A human being is considered
always vicious. One who carries a stone in his lap without being aware
of it, and while getting up from his seat drops it, as regards damages
he is liable. One who drops a vessel from the top of a roof upon the
ground which has been covered with

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

pillows, and if another person remove them before the dropping of the
vessel, etc., what is the law? Is a slave considered one's body, and an
ox one's property? [47](kam05.htm#page_47)-[56](kam05.htm#page_56.md)

### CHAPTER III.

MISHNAS *I*. TO *V*. If one place a jug on public ground and another
person stumble over it and break it, what is the law? One who kicks
another with his knee is fined three selas; with the foot, five; with
the fist, thirteen; what is the fine if one strike his neighbor with the
handle or the iron of the hoe? A jug that broke on public ground and its
contents caused a person to slip and fall, or one to be injured by its
fragments, what is the law? About one who renounces ownership to his
articles that cause damage. One who empties water into public ground, or
one who builds his fence of thorns; or a fence that falls into public
ground, and some persons were injured thereby, he is liable. The former
pious men used to bury their thorns and broken glass in their fields
three spans below the surface. All those who obstruct a public
thoroughfare by placing chattels therein and cause damage are liable. If
one carrying a barrel followed one carrying a beam, and the barrel was
broken by the beam, what is the law? Potters and glaziers that walked
one following the other, and one stumbled and fell, etc. If they all
fell because of the first one, the first is liable for the damage of all
of them, [57](kam06.htm#page_57)-[69](kam06.htm#page_69.md)

MISHNAS *VI*. TO *XIII*. Two that walked on public ground, one running
and the other one walking, etc., what is the law? One who chopped wood
on public ground and caused damage on private ground, etc. One who
enters a carpenter's shop without permission, and was struck on his face
by a flying splinter. About employees who came to demand their wages
from their employer and were gored by his ox or bitten by his dog. About
two non-vicious oxen that wounded each other.

The difference in the explanation of the verse Exod. xxi. 35. About a
non-vicious ox that has done damage and was sold, consecrated,
slaughtered, or presented to somebody. About an ox of the value of two
hundred selas that gored another ox of equal value and the carcass was
of no value what ever. There are cases when one is liable for the acts
of his ox and is free if they are his own acts, and *vice versa*. How
so? The rule is that the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff. If one
claims that he is positive, while the other one is not positive, what is
the law? [69](kam06.htm#page_69)[81](kam06.htm#page_81.md)

### CHAPTER IV.

MISHNAS *I*. TO *IV*. An ox that gores four or five oxen one after
another, the last of them must be paid from the body of the goring ox,
if he was yet considered non-vicious. About an ox that is vicious
towards his own species, but not towards other species, or towards human
beings, etc. There is a case where an ox became vicious -in alternate
order." About an ox

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

belonging to an Israelite that gored an ox belonging to the sanctuary
(see footnote). An ox of a sound person that gored an ox belonging to a
deaf-mute, idiot, or minor, there is a liability. If the reverse was the
case there is none. There is a difference of opinion of the Tanaim as to
whether a guardian is appointed in order to collect from the body of the
ox. Guardians pay from the best estates, but do not pay the atonement
money. About one who borrows an ox with the understanding that he was
non-vicious and it was found out that he was vicious,
[82](kam07.htm#page_82)-[93](kam07.htm#page_93.md)

MISHNAS *V*. TO *IX*. An ox that killed a man by goring him, if he was a
vicious one, the atonement money is to be paid, but not when he was a
non-vicious one. How can there be found a vicious ox in regard to man?
If one confers, saying, "My ox has killed a certain person," or "his
ox," he has to pay on his own testimony. If one's fire has done damage
without intention, is there a liability or not? About an ox that was
rubbing against a wall, whereby the wall fell upon a human being and
killed him. About an ox belonging to a woman, to orphans, or their
guardian, etc., that killed a man. About an ox that was sentenced to be
put to death and his owner consecrated him. About an ox delivered to a
gratuitous bailee or a borrower, etc. About an ox which was properly
locked up, but yet broke out and did damage. Whence is it deduced that
one must not raise a noxious dog in his house, nor maintain a defective
ladder? [93](kam07.htm#page_93)-[105](kam07.htm#page_105.md)

### CHAPTER V.

MISHNAS *I*. TO *VI*. About an ox that gored a cow and the new-born calf
was found dead at her side. The cow and her offspring are not separately
appraised. A potter that placed his pottery in the court of another, or
one who led his ox into the court of another without permission, what is
the law? When he assured the safety of the ox, did it only extend to
himself or also to all cattle? About a woman that entered a house to
bake, and the house-owner's goat, having consumed the dough, became
feverish and died. About one who enters a court without permission and
injures the court. owner, or the latter is injured through him. About
one who said: "Lead in your ox and take care of him," and he did damage
or was injured. About an ox which intended to gore another ox, and
injured a woman and caused her to miscarry. To whom must the
compensation for the miscarriage be paid, to the woman or to her
husband? Does the increase in the valuation also belong to the husband?
About an Israelite's pledge which is in the hands of a proselyte, and
the latter dies without heirs. About one who digs a pit on private
ground and opens it into public ground, or *vice versa*. One who digs
and opens a well and delivers it over to the community is free. About
one who digs a pit on public ground and an ox or an ass falls into it.
Are the vapors therein contained, or is the shock received by the
animal, the cause of death when falling into a pit?
[106](kam08.htm#page_106)-[120](kam08.htm#page_120.md)

MISHNAS *VII*. TO *IX*. When a pit belongs to two partners, and one of
them passes by and does not cover it, and so also does the second, the
latter only is liable. About a pit which was ten spans deep and which
was completed

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

by another one to be twenty, and still by another one to be thirty spans
deep. Each span of water equals two of dry ground. If one dig a pit ten
spans deep and another widen it toward one direction only, what is the
law? One who sells his house, the title passes with the delivery of the
keys. If he sells a flock of cattle, title passes with the delivery of
the Mashkhukhith (the forerunning goat kept at the head of the flock as
a leader). If he covered the pit sufficiently to withstand oxen but not
camels, and .camels came along and made the cover shaky and then oxen
fell therein, what is the law? What about the *germon* of damage? About
one who places a stone on the edge of the opening of a pit, and an ox
stumbles over the stone and falls into the pit. About an ox and a man
who together push some other into a pit. There is no difference between
an ox and another animal as regards falling into a pit, to have been
kept distant from Mount Sinai, payment of double, restitution of lost
property, unloading, muzzling, Kilayim, and Sabbath. Nor is there any
difference between the above-mentioned and a beast or bird. Why in the
first commandments is it not written "that it maybe well with thee,"
while in the second commandments it is?
[120](kam08.htm#page_120)-[130](kam08.htm#page_130.md)

### CHAPTER VI.

MISHNAS *I*. TO *III*. If one drive his sheep into a sheep-cot and
properly bolt the gate, but still they manage to come out and do damage,
he is free. There are four things for which one who does them cannot be
held responsible before an earthly tribunal, although he will be
punished for them by the Divine court. Is armed robbery, when not
committed publicly, still considered theft as regards the payment of
double? For frightening away a lion from one's neighbor's field the law
awards no compensation. How does it pay what it damaged? About one who
came before the Exilarch and complained of another who destroyed one of
his trees. One who destroys a young date-tree, what amount of damage
must he pay? There was a case, and Rabh acted in accordance with R.
Meir; but in his lectures, however, he declared that the Halakha
prevails in accordance with R. Simeon b. Gamaliel (see foot-note). About
one who puts up a stack of grain on another's land without permission.
One who started a fire through the medium of a deaf-mute, etc., 131-142

MISHNAS *IV*. TO *VIII*. The law about one who starts a fire and it
consumes wood, stones, or earth. No chastisements come upon the world
unless there are wicked ones in existence. When pestilence is raging in
town, stay indoors, etc. Why does the verse begin with the damage by
one's property and end with damage done by one's person? About a fire
that passed over a fence four ells high. If one starts a fire on his own
premises, how far must it pass to make the starter liable? About one who
causes his neighbor's stack of grain to burn down, and there are vessels
therein which also are burned. If one allowed another to place a stack
of wheat and he covered it with barley, or *vice versa*, what is the
law? Is it customary with people to keep pearls in a money-pouch? The
law about a spark that escapes from under a blacksmith's hammer and does
damage, [142](kam09.htm#page_142)-[148](kam09.htm#page_148.md)

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

### CHAPTER VII.

MISHNA *I*. The payment of double is more rigorous than the payment of
four and five fold. The law about one who stole a lamb, and while in his
possession it grew into a ram, etc. That a change acquires title is both
written and taught. Why did the Scripture say that if he slaughtered and
sold it he must pay four and five fold? A stolen thing, which the owners
have not resigned hope to regain, cannot be consecrated, etc. The pious
man used to place money in the vineyard on a Sabbatical year, declaring:
"All that is plucked and gathered of this fruit shall be redeemed by
this money." A writ of replevin which does not contain the following
directions "Investigate, take possession, and retain it for yourself,"
is invalid, [149](kam10.htm#page_149)-[159](kam10.htm#page_159.md)

MISHNAS *II*. TO *VI*. About two witnesses who testify that the one
stole an ox or a sheep, and either the same or other witnesses testify
that he slaughtered or sold the same. If he stole from his father. From
what time on is a collusive witness disqualified to give testimony? If
two witnesses testify that a certain person blinded his slave's eye, and
thereafter knocked out one of his teeth, and they also testify that the
owner of the slave admitted it, and subsequently the witnesses are found
collusive, what must the collusive witnesses pay? If two witnesses
testify that he stole it, and one witness, or he himself, testified that
he slaughtered or sold it, he pays only two, but not four and five fold.
One who admits that he has incurred the liability of a fine, and
thereafter witnesses appear, what is the law? About a confession which
is made after the appearance of witnesses, and the different opinions in
regard to it. If the thief sells all but one hundredth part of it or he
is a co-owner of it, what is the law? One who steals an animal which is
lame or blind, or which belongs to a copartnership is liable, but
partners that steal together are free. About one who steals an animal
within the premises of the owner and slaughters or sells it outside of
it, or *vice versa*. Why did the Scripture treat more rigorously with
the thief than with the robber? Ponder over the greatness of labor,
etc., [159](kam10.htm#page_159)-[174](kam10.htm#page_174.md)

MISHNA *VII*. No tender cattle must be raised in Palestine but in its
forests. A shepherd (who raises tender cattle) that repented, we do not
compel him to sell out all his cattle at once. No tender beasts shall be
raised in Palestine, except dogs, cats, and monkeys. R. A'ha b. Papa
said in the name of R. Hanina b. Papa three things. Upon ten conditions
did Joshua divide the land among the settlers. The ten enactments of
Ezra. No swine is permitted to be raised at anyplace. Rabbi, the Prince
of Pales tine, objected to the use of the Syriac language, and insisted
that only the Holy and the Greek languages should be used in Palestine.
R. Jose objected to the use of the Aramean language in Babylon, and
insisted that the Holy and the Persian languages should be used. No dogs
shall be kept unless on a chain. In the towns adjoining the frontier
they must be kept on a chain only in the day time, 174-181

### CHAPTER VIII.

MISHNAS *I*. AND *II*. The four items of damage: pain, healing, loss of
time, and disgrace. How so? It happened that an ox lacerated the arm

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

of a child, and the case came before Rabha, etc. When the damage is paid
for, how should the pain be appraised separately? Healing. If pus
collected by reason of the wound, and the wound broke out again, etc.
The sages say that healing and loss of time go together. If the
defendant should say, "I will cure you myself, the plaintiff may
object," etc. Shall we assume that the appraisement for the deafness is
sufficient, or each of the injuries must be appraised separately? (See
foot-note.) If one strikes another and makes him temporarily unfit to
labor, what is the law? Disgrace--all those who sustain injury are
looked upon as if they were independent men, etc. One who causes
disgrace to a nude, blind, or sleeping person is liable. If one causes
shame to a sleeping person who subsequently dies while asleep, what is
the law? Is the reason because of the hurting of his own feelings, or
because of the feelings of his family? Is a blind person required to per
form all the commandments? and what R. Joseph, who was blind, said of
that, [182](kam11.htm#page_182)-[193](kam11.htm#page_193.md)

MISHNAS *III*. TO *V*. The law is more rigorous in regard to a man than
in regard to an ox, etc. One who assaults his father or mother, but does
not bruise them, and one who wounds another on the Day of Atonement, are
liable to pay all the items of damage. To whom belongs the compensation
received by one's minor daughter for a wound? About an investment for a
minor and the nature thereof, Is a slave considered a "brother"? The
Halakha prevails that the benefit in case of a woman who sells her right
in the marriage contract belongs to herself; and if she bought estates
therewith, her husband has nothing even in their income. If one blow
into the ear of another, he pays one sela for the disgrace he caused
him. What if one strikes another with the palm or with the back of his
hand on the cheek? This is the rule: Rank and station of the parties are
taken into consideration. May a witness be a judge in the same case? A
non-vicious ox that killed a man and also caused damage to another, must
his owner pay for the damage, besides the payment of the atonement
money? All that was said concerning disgrace is only for the civil
court, as to how much the plaintiff should receive, but there can be no
satisfaction for the injury to the feelings, for which, if he would even
offer all the best rams of the world, they would not atone, unless he
prays the plaintiff for forgiveness. The origin of a series of sayings
by the rabbis as well as by ordinary people. If one says to another,
"Break my pitcher," etc. A money-pouch containing charity funds was sent
to Pumbeditha, and R. Joseph deposited it with a certain man who did not
take good care of it and it was stolen from him, and R. Joseph held him
responsible. What Abayi said to him about it,
[193](kam11.htm#page_193)-[210](kam11.htm#page_210.md)
