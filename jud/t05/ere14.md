# CHAPTER V.

A SCHOLAR must not eat standingly, nor lick his fingers, nor yawn in
presence of others. Talk little, laugh little, sleep little, indulge
little in pleasure, say little "yea" and little "nay." One has always to
know with whom he is sitting, near whom he is standing, with whom he is
eating, with whom he is conversing, for whom he signs contracts and
notes of debt. By four things the scholar is recognized: his pocket, his
goblet, his anger, and his dress; and, some say, even his talk. The
beauty of the Law is wisdom; the beauty of wisdom is modesty; the beauty
of modesty is the fear of Heaven; the beauty of the fear of Heaven is
noble performance; the beauty

of noble performance is secrecy (*i.e.*, not publicly, for the purpose
of being praised). One shall not be awake, etc. (see above).
