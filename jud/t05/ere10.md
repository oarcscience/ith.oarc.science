# CHAPTER XI.

HE who walks the road, etc. (See the whole Boraitha in Yomah, pages 27,
28, paragraph: "We have learned according to R. Shila"). One who, soon
after returning from the road, takes a bath, gets intoxicated, sleeps on
the bare floor, and indulges *in congressu feminæ*, his blood is on his
head (it is equivalent to suicide). <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4) He
who sells his books, or his daughter, etc. (See Megilla, p. 73.) R.
Itzhak says: "A common informer is considered a murderer, as it is
written \[Lev. xix. 16\]: 'Thou shalt not go up and down as a
tale-bearer among thy people.'" R. Eliezer said: "He who hates his
neighbor without cause is also considered such, as it is written \[Deut.
xix. ii\]: 'But if any man be an enemy to his neighbor,' etc. (*i.e.*,
if he is so, he is capable of doing what is further written in the
verse)." Ben Azai says: "He who hates his wife is also considered such,
as it is written \[ibid. xxii. 13 and 14\] (*i.e.*, if he hates her he
will finally lay an accusation against her, etc., and he will hire
witnesses to accuse her with a view to take her life)." R. Jose says:
"One who sets a definite time for the redemption of Israel through
Messiah will have no share in the world to come. And the same applies to
one who hates the scholars and their disciples. The same applies to a

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

false prophet and a slanderer." R. Meir says: "One who has a house of
learning in his town, and is able to go there but does not do so, is not
worthy of living, as it is written \[Numb. xv. 31\]: 'Because the word
of the Lord hath he despised;' etc." Haughtiness is equivalent to
idolatry, as it is written \[Deut. vii. 26\]: "And thou shalt not bring
an abomination with thy house;" and it is also written \[Prov. xvi. 5\]:
"An abomination of the Lord is every one that is proud of heart." Since
the abomination mentioned in Deuteronomy is idolatry, and the same
expression is used in Proverbs, hence we learn that haughtiness is
equivalent to idolatry. <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_4"></span>[17:1](ere10.htm#fr_4) Here the Boraitha
continues to enumerate things dangerous to life and health which seem to
us unimportant in our age, and therefore we omit them.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[18:1](ere10.htm#fr_5) Here follows the
benediction before retiring, etc., which will be explained in the proper
tract.
