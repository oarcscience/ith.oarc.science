# CHAPTER V.

MISHNA *A*. By ten sayings the world was created; and why so? Could it
not have been created by one saying? But it was that vengeance might be
taken on the wicked, who destroy the world that was created by ten
sayings; and to give a goodly reward to the righteous, who maintain the
world that was created by ten sayings.

Tosephtha--Aboth of R. Nathan.

"*By ten sayings the world was created*." For what purpose is this
stated? To teach that if one carries out a precept, or observes one
Sabbath, or preserves a soul, it is considered as if he had preserved
the entire world, which was created with ten sayings. But he who
transgresses once, or violates one Sabbath, or destroys one soul, is
considered like unto one who has destroyed the entire world, which was
created with ten sayings. And so we find with Cain, who killed his
brother Abel, as it is written \[Gen. iv. 10\]: "The voice of thy
brother's blood (in plural)." He shed only the blood of one person--why
is the plural used? Infer from this that the blood of the decedent's
children, grandchildren, and all the descendants which were destined to
be descended from him, were all crying before the Holy One, blessed be
He.

R. Nehemiah said: "Whence is it deduced that a single person is equal to
the whole creation? It is written \[ibid. v. 1\]: 'This is the book of
the generations of Adam.' And before that it is written \[ibid. ii. 4\]:
'These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they
were created.' We see that with reference to the creation of man almost
the same wording is used as with reference to the creation of heaven and
earth, which goes to show that one is as much as the other. Likewise may
be inferred from this, that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed him
(Adam) all the generation which were to spring from him, as if they were
standing and playing before him." There

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

are others who say that the righteous only were shown to him, as it is
written \[Is. iv. 3\]: "Every one that is written down into life in
Jerusalem.

R. Joshua b. Kar'hah said: "It is written \[Ps. cxxxix. 16\]: 'My
undeveloped substance did thy eyes see, and in thy book,' etc. Infer
from this that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed unto Adam all
succeeding generations, together with their preachers, directors,
leaders, prophets, heroes, criminals, and their pious. In this or that
generation, such and such a king will reign; in another, a certain sage
will exist, etc."

R. Eliezer the son of R. Jose the Galilean said: "Nine hundred and
seventy-four generations before the creation of the world, the Torah was
already written and reposing in the lap of the Lord, and sung praises
together with the angels, as it is written \[Ps. viii. 8, 9\]: 'Then was
I near him as a nursling; and I was day by day (his) delight, playing
before him at all times; playing in the world, his earth.' They have
compared this to one who desired to engrave many subjects on a piece of
wood, and as it was not of sufficient size, he was in despair. What
could he do? Let him engrave upon the earth, where he has enough space.
So also did the Holy One, blessed be He, whose great name shall be
praised for ever and evermore, when He in His wisdom and understanding
created the entire world. He created the heavens and the earth in the
upper and lower regions, and created in man all that he created in his
world: the world contains forests, so also does man, viz., his hair; the
world contains evil beasts, so does man, viz., lice; there are thorns in
the world, so also are they in man--his ears; there is odor, so also in
man--his nose; light--man's sight; evil-smelling liquids, so also in
man--the excretion of the nose; salty water, so also in man--tears;
rivers, so also in man--his urine; castles, so also in man--his lips;
gates, so also in man--his teeth; sweet water, so also in man--his
saliva; stars, so also in man--his cheeks; towers, so also in man--his
neck; cathedrals, so also in man--his arms; nails, so also in man--his
fingers; a king, so also in man--his head; advisers, so also in man--his
kidneys; millstones, so also in man--his stomach; regulations, so also
in man--his spleen; manure, so also in man--his belly; pits, so also in
man--his navel; spring-water, so also in man--his blood; trees, so also
in man--his bones; hills, so also in man--his ashes; a mortar and
pestle, so also in man--his knees; horses, so also in man--his legs;
hills and valleys, so also in man--when

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

standing he is like a hill and when lying he is like a valley Hence all
that which the Holy One, blessed be He, created in His world, He also
created in man."

MISHNA *B*. Ten generations were there from Adam to Noah, to show how
great was His long-suffering; for all the generations were provoking
him, till He brought the deluge upon them.

Tosephtha--Aboth of R. Nathan.

 <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_68.md)"*Ten generations were there from
Adam to Noah*." For what purpose was this stated? To teach that all
these generations persisted in provoking the Lord, nevertheless He did
not bring the flood on the world, for the sake of the upright and pious.
There are others who say: As long as Methuselah lived, the flood
descended not upon the world; and it was even suspended for seven days
after his demise; as it is written \[Gen. vii. 10\]: "And it came to
pass, after the seven days." What seven days? The period of mourning for
the upright, who prevented the retribution.

Another explanation is: The above passage teaches that the Holy One,
blessed be He, granted them an additional respite, after the original
one hundred and twenty years, of seven days, in which time to repent.

Still another explanation is, that the Lord changed the order of the
world for seven days, causing the sun to rise in the west and to set in
the east, so that perchance they would notice it, become frightened, and
repent; however, it had no effect.

Still another explanation is, that the Lord spread His table before them
during seven days, and gave them an inkling of what there was in the
world to come, so they might reflect and say: Woe to us, for all this
good which is lost to us, and for the destruction of our offspring, as
it is written \[ibid. vi. 12\]: And God looked upon the earth, and,
behold, it was corrupt.

R. Elazar b. Parta said: "It is written \[ibid., ibid. 3\]: 'My spirit
shall not always strive for the sake of man.' It means that the Lord
said: 'I will not judge them until I will double their rewards,' as it
is written \[Job, xxi. 13\]: 'They wear out

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

their days in happiness; and in a moment they go down to the nether
world.'

R. Jose the Galilean said: "It is written: 'My spirit shall not always
strive.' It means that the Lord said: 'I will not equal the evil
thoughts to the good thoughts so long as their fate has not yet been
sealed.' After that, however, both are equal in transgression."

He used to say: "The evil spirit is removed from the upright and the
good spirit predominates, as it is written \[Ps. cix. 22\]: 'And my
heart is deeply wounded within me.' From the wicked, however, the good
thoughts are removed and evil thoughts are given them instead, as it is
written \[ibid. xxxvi. 2\]: 'Saith vice itself to the wicked, So I feel
it within my heart, that he should have no dread of God before his
eyes.' To people of mediocrity both are given: the one who is nearer to
the good thoughts is ruled by them, and one who is nearer to the evil
thoughts is ruled by them, as it is written \[ibid. cix. 31\]: 'For he
ever standeth at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those
that judge his soul.'"

R. Simeon b. Elazar said It is written \[Gen. vi. 3\]: 'My spirit shall
not strive,' etc. This means the Lord said: 'I will not judge them
before I have rewarded the upright.' This is only as to this world; but
as to the world to come, it is written \[ibid. cxlvi. 46\]: 'When his
spirit goeth forth, he returneth to his (native) earth.'"

R. Aqiba said, of the same verse: "The Lord said: 'They have not
reflected that they are flesh and blood.' On the contrary, they were
haughty, and said unto God: 'Depart from us'" \[Job, xxi. 14\].

R. Meir said, of the same verse: "This means that the Holy One, blessed
be He, said: 'This generation said: God does not judge, there is no
judge in the world; God has left it.'"

Rabbi said, of the same verse: "This means that the Holy One, blessed be
He, said: 'They have not instituted a Sanhedrin on earth, therefore will
I institute for them a Sanhedrin on high.'"

MISHNA *C*. Ten generations were there from Noah to Abraham, to show how
great was His long-suffering; for all the generations were provoking Him
till Abraham our father came, and received the reward of them all.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

Tosephtha-Aboth of R. Nathan.

 <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_69.md)"Ten generations," etc. For what
purpose was it necessary to state this? To teach that all these
generations have provoked Him, and there was not one who walked in the
way of the Holy One, blessed be He, till Abraham our father, as it is
written \[Gen. xxvi. 5\]: "Because that Abraham obeyed my voice . . .
and my laws." Are there then two Laws? Infer from this that the Lord
provided Abraham with two reins, which, like two sages, made him
understand, advised him and taught him all night, as it is written \[Ps.
xvi. 7\]: "I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: also in the
night season my reins admonish me." And not only that, but Abraham our
father was wont to practise charity first and justice afterward, as it
is written \[Gen. xviii. 19\]: "For I know him, that he will command,"
etc. When two disputants came before him, and, one of them complained
that the other owed him a manah, Abraham was wont to deposit a manah of
his own with one of them, and then said: Make your complaints. When he
found that one really owed the other, he said to the one with whom he
deposited the manah: "Give it to thy neighbor"; and if neither owed the
other, he said: "Divide it between yourselves, and depart in peace."
However, David the king practised justice first and charity after, as it
is written \[II Samuel, viii. 15\]: "And David did what was just and
right unto all his people." When two disputants came to him, and one of
them claimed that the other owed him a manah, he told them to make their
complaints, and after finding one of them liable, he used to give the
other the manah; otherwise, he said: "Divide your claims, and depart in
peace."

MISHNA *D*. With ten temptations was Abraham our, father tempted, and he
withstood them all, to show how great was the love of Abraham our
father.

Tosephtha--Aboth of R. Nathan.

"*With ten temptations*," etc. They are as follows: two at "get thee out
of thy country"; two with his two sons; two

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

with his two wives; one with the kings; one at "*the* pieces"; one at Ur
of the Chaldees; and one at the circumcision. Wherefore so many? For the
reason that when Abraham our father will claim his reward, the angels
shall say: More than us, even more than all of us, is he worthy to
receive his rewards, as it is written \[Eccl. ix. 7\]: "Go, eat with joy
thy bread, and drink with a merry heart thy wine."

In comparison to these ten temptations, the Holy One, blessed be He,
performed ten miracles for his descendants in Egypt, and also brought
ten plagues (on the Egyptians); and performed ten miracles for the
Israelites at the sea, and brought ten plagues on the Egyptians at the
sea. The Egyptians roared at them with their voices, so also did the
Lord roar at them at the sea, as it is written \[Job, xxxvii. 5\]: "God
thundereth with his marvellous voice." The Egyptians came to the sea
with bows and arrows, so also did the Lord appear, as it is written
\[Habakkuk, iii. 9\]: "Laid quite bare is thy bow"; also \[Ps. xviii.
15\]: "And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them." The Egyptians
came to the sea armed with swords, so also did the Lord, as it is
written \[ibid.\]: "And he shot forth lightnings, and discomfited
them"--lightning means sword, as it is written \[Ezek. xxi. 14, 15\]:
"The sword, the sword is sharpened, and also polished: in order to make
a thorough slaughter it is sharpened, in order that it may glitter <span
id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_70.md) is it polished." <span
id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_70.md) The Egyptians came armed with spears, so
also did the Lord, as it is written \[Habakkuk, iii. 11\]: "At the
shining of the flaming glitter of thy spear." The Egyptians were proud
of their shield and buckler; so was the Lord, as it is written \[Ps.
xxxv. 2\]: "Take hold of shield and buckler, and rise up for my help."
The Egyptians came with sling-stones, but the Lord with hailstones, as
it is written \[Ps. xviii. 13\]: "From the brightness before him his
thick clouds passed away (with) hail-stones and coals of fire."

When our fathers stood by the sea, Moses said to them: "Arise and pass
through it!" and they rejoined: "We will not pass, till we see the sea
become chips, chips." <span id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_71.md) Whereupon
Moses struck the sea with his staff, and it was converted into chips, as
it is written \[Habakkuk, iii. 14\]: "Thou didst strike through with his
own spears the chiefs of his villages." Again

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

Moses said to them: "Arise and pass through it," and they rejoined: "We
will not pass till the sea becomes a valley." Moses struck the sea
again, and it became a valley, as it is written \[Ps. lviii. 13\]: "He
divided the sea, and caused them to pass through"; also \[Is. lxiii.
14\]: "As a beast goeth down into the valley." Moses again urged them to
pass through the sea, and they answered: "We will not, till it becomes
separated into parts"; as it is written \[Ps. cxxxvi. 13\]: "To him who
divided the Red Sea into parts." When urged again, they said: "We will
not pass till the bottom becomes loamy." Whereupon Moses struck the sea
with his staff, and the bottom became loamy, as it is written
\[Habakkuk, iii. 15\]: "But (thou) didst pass along over the sea with
thy horses, over the piled-up billows <span
id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_72.md) of great waters." Again they refused to
pass through, until the bottom of the sea should become a desert; and
Moses caused it to be so, as it is written \[Ps. cvi. 9\]: "And he led
them through the depths, as through the wilderness." They refused again
until the sea became converted into small particles, and Moses caused it
to be so, as it is written \[ibid. lxxiv. 13\]: "It was thou that didst
divide by thy strength the sea." They again refused until it should
become rocky, and Moses caused it to be so, as it is written \[ibid.\]:
"Thou brokest in pieces the heads of the crocodiles on the water," and
that can be broken on rocks only. They again refused until the sea
should become dry land, and Moses made it so, as it is written \[ibid.
lxvi. 6\]: "He changed the sea into dry land"; also \[Ex. xv. 19\]: "But
the children of Israel went on dry ground through the midst of the sea."
They refused again until the waters became as walls, and Moses made them
so, as it is written \[Ex. xiv. 22\]: "And the waters were a wall unto
them, on their right hand, and on their left." They still refused till
there should be bottles, and Moses complied again, as it is written
\[ibid. xv. 8\]: "The flood stood upright as a wall." <span
id="fr_75"></span>[2](#fn_73.md) And the infants were drinking oil and
honey out of these bottles, as it is written \[Deut. xxxii. 13\]: "And
he made him to suck honey out of the rock," etc. There are others who
say: "Living water issued out of the sea, when they were between the
walls, and they drank of it, as the sea water is salty; for it is stated
"the flood," and that means sweet water, as it is written \[Songs, iv.
15\]: "A well of living waters,

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

and flowing down from Lebanon." The clouds of glory were above their
heads, to protect them from the sun.

R. Eliezer said: "The deep was arched over their heads, while passing
through the sea, to save them from pain." The former and the latter both
say: The upper and the lower waters overthrew the Egyptians, as it is
written \[Ex. xiv. 27\]: "And the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the
midst of the sea."

MISHNA *F*. With ten temptations did our ancestors tempt God in the
wilderness, as it is written \[Numb. xxv. 22\]: "And have tempted me
these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice."

Tosephtha--Aboth of R. Nathan.

 <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_74.md)"*By means of ten trials the Holy
One, blessed be He, tested our forefathers*," and they were found
wanting in all of them. They are as follows: In the wilderness, in the
plain, opposite Suph, between Paran and Thophel and Laban and Chazeroth
and Di-zahab. "In the wilderness" they made the golden calf, as it is
written \[Ex. xxxii. 8\]: "They have made themselves a molten calf." "In
the plain" they quarrelled with Moses on account of water, as it is
written \[ibid. xvii. 3\]: "And the people thirsted there for water."
"Opposite Suph"--their rebellion at the Red Sea. There are others who
say: This has reference to Michah's graven image. "Between Paran"--where
the incident of the spies occurred \[Numb. xiii. 3\]: "And Moses sent
them out from the wilderness of Paran." "And Thophel" refers to the
nonsense (slander) <span id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_75.md) they talked of
the manna. "And Laban"--this is the dissension of Korah. "And
Chazeroth"--near which place the incident of the quails occurred. All
these are seven, and somewhere else it is written \[Deut. ix. 22\]: "And
at Thah'erah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hat-thavah." (Making
altogether ten.) What does Di-zahab refer to? Aaron said to them: "Ye
have enough of the sin of the gold which ye brought for the calf."

R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: "This sin with which the Israelites were
afflicted, is enough for that time till the resurrection of the dead."

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

Ten names of praise are applied to the Holy One, blessed be He:
"Adonai," "Jah," "Eloim," "Eloah," "Eloechu," "Eloechem," "El,"
"Eheh-ascher-Eheh," "Shadai," "Zebaoth." Said R. Jose: "I do not agree
as to the name "Zebaoth," for it is written \[Deut. xx. 9\]: "That they
shall appoint captains for the *armies*," the Hebrew term for "army"
being "Zebaoth." (These being *proper* names of God, we have not
translated them.)

Ten ignominious names are applied to the idols. They are as follows:
Abominations, idols, molten images, graven images, false gods, groves,
sun-images, Atzabim, Aven, images.

Two signs (the inverted letter Nun) are placed in the Torah at a small
section, viz.: "And it came to pass, when the ark set forward," etc.
\[Numb. x. 35, 36\]. Said Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel: "It would have been
advisable to remove this section and put it in another place. Something
like this we find elsewhere \[Judges, xviii. 20\]: 'And Jonathan, the
son of Gershom, the son of Menasseh,' was he the son of Menasseh, and
not the son of Moses? But because his deeds were not like those of his
father Moses, therefore he is traced to Menasseh."

Likewise we find \[Zech. iv. 14\]: "These are the two sons of the clear
oil, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth." This refers to Aaron
and the Messiah, and we do not know who is more beloved; but, as it is
written \[Ps. cx. 4\]: "The Lord hath sworn, and will not repent of it,
thou shalt be a priest for ever." It is to be inferred from this that
the latter is more beloved.

It is said \[Ps. lxxx. 14\]: "The boar out of the forest doth gnaw at
it." Is it not written *out of the river*? <span
id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_76.md) The difference in the two words implies
this: As long as Israel act contrary to the will of the Omnipotent, the
idolaters are likened to them as a boar out of the forest, which kills
the people, damages the cattle, and is an affliction to mankind.
However, when the Israelites act according to the will of the
Omnipotent, the idolaters are likened unto them, as the boar out of the
river (hippopotamus), which does not kill people, nor injures any
creatures. Many words of the Torah are dotted. They are as follows: "May
the Lord judge between me and *thee*" \[Gen. xvi. 5\].

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The second Yod is
dotted in the word "ubenecha," which hints that she (Sarah) applied it
to Hagar. Others say she meant those who caused quarrelling between her
and him. "And they said unto *him*, Where is Sarah thy wife?" \[ibid.
xviii. 9\]. The Aleph, Yod, and Vav are dotted to imply that, although
they knew where she was, still they inquired after her. "And he
perceived not when she lay down, nor when she *arose*" \[ibid. xix.
33\]. The second Vav is dotted, to imply that he perceived only when the
younger arose. "And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on
his neck and *kissed him*" \[ibid. xxxiii. 4\]. All the letters of the
word "vayishokehu" are dotted, to signify that he was not sincere. R.
Simeon b. Elazar said: "It implies, on the contrary, that this kissing
was sincere, but all his other acts were insincere." "And his brothers
went to feed his father's *flocks* in Shechem" \[ibid. xxxvii. 12\].
There are dots on the word "eth," to imply that they did not go to feed
the flocks, but to eat, drink, and commit follies. "All that were
numbered of the Levites, whom Moses numbered *with Aaron*" \[Numb. iii.
39\]. The entire word is dotted, to imply that Aaron was not included in
the number. "Or be on *a distant* journey" \[ibid. ix. 10\]. The Heh in
the word "rechokah" is dotted, to imply that it does not really mean a
distant journey, only that he was prohibited from passing the threshold
of the outer court (of the Temple). "And we have laid waste (all) up to
Naphach, *which* reacheth unto Medeba" \[ibid. xxi. 30\]. The Resh in
the word "asher" is dotted, to imply that only the idolaters laid waste
the countries. Concerning the first day of Tabernacles, it is written
\[ibid. xxix. 15\]: "And a *tenth part each*." The Vav of the word
"eissoron" is dotted, to imply that there should be only one-tenth part.
And, lastly: "The secret things belong unto the Lord out God; but those
things which are publicly known belong *to us* and to *our children for*
ever" \[Deut. xxix. 30\]. The entire two first words and the Ayin of the
third are dotted, to imply that Ezra said: If Elijah will come and
question me why I have written thus, will answer: 'I have already dotted
them.' However, if he will say: 'Thou hast written well,' I will erase
the dots."

In the Torah there is written eleven times the word ‏היא‎ (which means
"she"), when it ought to be ‏הוא‎ (he). (See Massorah.)

Ten times did the Shekhina descend upon the earth. Once in the Garden of
Eden, as it is written \[Gen. iii. 8\]: "And they

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden." Once in the
generation of the (builders of) the tower, as it is written \[ibid. xi.
5\]: "And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower." Once in
Sodom, as it is written \[ibid. xviii. 21\]: "And I will go down now,
and see if they have done according to the cry against them." Once in
Egypt, as it is written \[Ex. iii. 8\]: "And I am come down to deliver
it out of the hand of the Egyptians." Once at the sea, as it is written
\[Ps. xviii. 10\]: "And he bent the heavens, and came down." Once at
Sinai, as it is written \[Ex. xix. 20\]: "And the Lord came down upon
Mount Sinai." Once at the Temple, as it is written \[Ezek. xliv. 2\]:
"This gate shall remain locked, it shall not be opened . . . because the
Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it." Once at the pillar of
cloud, as it is written \[Numb. xi. 25\]: "And the Lord came down in a
cloud." And once when it will come down in the days of Gog and Magog, as
it is written \[Zech. xiv. 4\]: "And his feet will stand on that day
upon the Mount of Olives."

Ten degrees the Shekhina removed itself from one place to another: From
the cover to the cherub, as it is written \[II Samuel, xxii. ii\]: "And
he rode upon a cherub, and flew along"; from the cherub to the
threshold, as it is written \[Ezek. ix. 3\]: "And the glory of the God
of Israel ascended up from the cherub whereupon it had been, to the
threshold of the house"; from the threshold to the two cherubim, as it
is written \[ibid. x. 18\]: "And the glory of the Lord went forth from
off the threshold of the house, and halted over the cherubim"; from the
cherubim to the roof, as it is written \[Prov. xxi. 9\]: "It is better
to dwell in a corner of a roof"; from the roof to the wall of the outer
court, as it is written \[Amos, vii. 7\]: "And, behold, the Lord was
standing upon a wall (made) by a plumbline"; from the wall of the outer
court to the altar, as it is written \[ibid. ix. 1\]: "I saw the Lord
standing upon the altar"; from the altar to the city, as it is written
\[Micah, vi. 9\]: "The voice of the Lord calleth unto the city"; from
the city to the mount, as it is written \[Ezek. xi. 23\]: "And the glory
of the Lord ascended from the midst of the city, and halted upon the
mount," etc.; from the mount to the desert, as it is written \[Prov.
xxi. 19\]: "It is better to dwell in a desert land"; and once when it
ascended on high, as it is written \[Hosea, v. 15\]: "I will go (hence,
and) return to my place."

A prophet is called by ten different names. They are as

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

follows: Ambassador, faithful, servant, messenger, seer, watchman, man
of scrutiny, dreamer, prophet, man of God.

There are ten names for the Holy Spirit, namely: Proverb, metaphor,
riddle, word, saying, calling, commandment, prophecy, sacred speech, and
vision.

Joy has ten different expressions: Gladness, joy, rejoicing, joyfulness,
pleasure, relish, satisfaction, complacency, delight, cheer.

Ten are called "living": The Holy One, blessed be He, as it is written
\[Jer. x. 10\]: "But the Lord God is the truth: he is the living God";
the Torah, as it is written \[Prov. iii. 18\]: "A tree of life is she to
those that lay hold on her: and every one that firmly graspeth her will
be made happy"; Israel, as it is written \[Deut. iv. 41: "But ye that
cleave unto the Lord your God are alive, every one of you, this day";
good deeds, as it is written \[Prov. xi. 30\]: "The fruit of the
righteous is of the tree of life"; the Garden of Eden, as it is written
\[Ps. cxvi. 9\]: "I will walk before the Lord in the lands of life"; the
tree, as it is written \[Gen. ii. 9\]: "And the tree of life in the
midst of the garden"; Palestine, as it is written \[Ezek. xxvi. 20\]:
"But I will bestow glory in the land of life"; charitable deeds, as it
is written \[Prov. Xii. 28\]: "On the path of righteousness there is
life"; the wise, as it is written \[ibid. xiii. 14\]: "The instruction
of the wise is a source of life"; light, as it is written \[Job, xxxiii.
30\]: "In the light of life."

MISHNA *E*. Ten miracles were wrought for our fathers in Egypt, and ten
by the sea.

MISHNA *G*. Ten miracles were wrought in the Sanctuary: No woman
miscarried from the scent of the holy meat, and the holy meat never
stank; and a fly was not seen in the slaughter-house; and an uncleanness
befell not the high-priest on the Day of Atonement; and a defect was not
found in the sheep, nor in the two loaves, nor in the shew-bread; and
rains did not extinguish the fire of the fuel heaped upon the altar, and
wind prevailed not against the pillar of smoke; they stood serried, and
bowed down at ease; and serpent and scorpion harmed not in Jerusalem,
and a man never said to his fellow, "The place is too strait for me to
lodge in Jerusalem,"

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

MISHNA *H*. Ten things were created at twilight of the eve of Sabbath:
the mouth of the earth and the mouth of the well, and the mouth of the
ass, and the bow, and the manna, and the rod, and the Shomir worm, and
the character and the writing, and the tables. And some say the evil
spirits also; and the sepulchre of Moses, and the ram of Abraham our
father; and some say the first tongs with which subsequently other tongs
were made.

Tosephtha--Aboth of R. Nathan.

 <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_77.md)Ten miracles were performed for our
forefathers in Jerusalem: The holy meat was never spoiled; no woman
miscarried from the scent of the holy meat; no one was ever injured; no
accident ever happened to any one; no one ever stumbled; no
conflagration ever occurred; no rain was ever there; no man ever said:
"I could find no oven wherein to roast the paschal lamb"; no man ever
said. "I could find no bed wherein to sleep"; no man ever said to
another: "I could find no quarters in which to pass the night."

Jerusalem never was defiled by leprosy, nor condemned as a misled city;
no ledges, galleries, or channels could be built on the public streets,
because they would form a tent for uncleanness; a corpse could not be
left there over night, nor human bones be carried through the streets,
and no stranger was permitted to settle within its walls. No graves
could be maintained there except those of the house of David and the
prophetess Huldah, which existed since the days of the early prophets.
It was said that there was a grotto which caused the uncleanness to run
into the brook Kidron. No plants must be planted there, and no gardens
or parks might be laid out there, except gardens of roses, which existed
there since the days of the early prophets. No geese nor hens might be
bred there, much less swine; no dung might remain there, because of
defilement. A stubborn and rebellious son is not judged there, such is
the decree of R. Nathan, for it is written \[Deut. xxi. 19\]: "Then
shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto
the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place but as they are
not his city and place, he cannot be judged. Houses cannot

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

be sold there together with the ground on which they stand. No house can
remain as a permanent possession after a twelve-month. No rent may be
taken for houses, but it may be for beds and mattresses. Said R.
Jehudah: "It is not allowed to take rent even for that." What did they
do with the skins of the holocaust? They were given to the lodging-house
keepers. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel said: "The innkeepers were in the inside
and the lodging-house keepers on the outside. The innkeepers used to buy
sheep, having nice wool, for four to five selahs, and sell them to the
Jerusalemites, and made big profits on them."

One verse says: "In one of thy tribes" \[Deut. xii. 14\]; and another
says: "Out of all your tribes" \[ibid., ibid. 5\]. The first relates to
the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, and the second to Jerusalem, which
belongs to all Israel. What belonged to Judah? The Temple Mount, the
chambers, and the outer courts; and to Benjamin belonged the Temple, the
porch, and the Holy of Holies, and a triangle extended into the part of
Judah in which the altar was built. Benjamin was favored, and became the
host of the Mightiness, as it is written \[ibid. xxxiii. 12\]: "And
between his shoulders will he dwell."

Said R. Jehudah: At the time when it became known that the Temple would
be built on the boundaries of Judah and Benjamin, they had improved and
separated the suburb of Jericho. And who ate its products all these
years? The children of the Kenite, the father-in-law of Moses, as it is
written \[Numb. x. 32\]: "It shall be, that the same goodness which the
Lord may do unto us will we do unto thee." However, when the Temple was
built, they vacated. And whence do we know that they were sustained by
charity? They said: "When the Lord will reveal His Shekhina, He will
reward Jethro and his children, as it is written \[ibid., ibid. 29\]:
For the Lord hath spoken (to bring) good upon Israel." Said R. Simeon:
They were prominent men and were proprietors of houses, fields, and
vineyards. However, because of the work of the Lord they left everything
and went away, as it is written \[I Chron. iv. 23\]: "There were the
potters, and those that dwelt in plantations," etc. They dwelt with the
king in his work. And where did they then go? To Jabez, to study the
Torah, and thus have become a people of the Omnipotent. Jabez was a very
good and righteous man: he was a truthful man and pious, and occupied
himself with the study of the Law; therefore the pious went to a pious.

"*Ten miracles were wrought*, etc.;

and an uncleanness befell

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

not the high-priest on the Day of Atonement"--except R. Ishmael b.
Kimchith, who went out to converse with a certain dignitary, and some
saliva dropped out of his mouth on his garments; and his brother entered
and officiated as high-priest in his stead, and their mother had the
satisfaction of seeing her two sons as high-priests on the same day.

The sages saw her, and said to her: "What piety hast thou practised?"
And she rejoined: "The ceilings of my house never saw my hair."

"*No woman miscarried*." It never happened that there was anything left
of the holy meat; and when they ate too much of it, they drank the
waters of Shiloach, which assisted digestion.

"*And a defect was not found*," etc. Broken earthen vessels were sunk in
the ground.

"*And wind prevailed not*," etc. And when the pillar of smoke went up
from the sacrificial altar, the smoke went up straight as a staff until
it reached the clouds; but the pillar of the incense went up from the
golden altar in the direction of the Holy of Holies.

"*They stood serried and bowed down*," etc. When the Israelites came up
to kneel before their Father in Heaven, it was so that they were compact
and no one could put his finger between them, but when kneeling every
one had ample space. The greatest wonder of all was, that even when a
hundred people entered at once there was no need for the inspectors of
the synagogue to proclaim: "Make room for your brother!" (Some think
that) the greatest wonder of all was, that when all stood up in prayer
they were compact and no one could put his finger between them, but when
they bowed there was a space of a man's height between them.

Said Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel: Jerusalem is destined that all the
nations and kingdoms should be gathered together in it, as it is written
\[Jer. iii. 17\]: "And all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the
name of the Lord"; and further: "Let the waters be gathered together"
\[Gen. i. 9\]. As "the gathering together" there means that all the
waters of creation shall be in one place, so also "the gathering
together" here means that all the nations and kingdoms shall be
assembled in it.

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

Tosephtha--Aboth of R. Nathan.

 <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_78.md)"*The men of Sodom*"--have no share
in the world to come, and they are not judged, as it is written \[Gen.
xiii. 13\]: "But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the
Lord exceedingly." "Wicked"--one with another; "sinners"--in
consanguinity; "before the Lord"--inasmuch as they desecrated the name
of God; "exceedingly"--they did all that intentionally. And it is
written \[Ps. i. 5\]: "Therefore shall the wicked not be able to stand
in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous." The
first part of the passage relates to the generation of the flood, and
the second to the men of Sodom. R. Nehemiah said: "Even in the
congregation of the wicked they are not included, as it is written
\[ibid. civ. 35\]: 'May the sinners cease from off the earth, and the
wicked be no more.'"

Small children of the wicked have no share in the world to come, and are
not judged, as it is written \[Mal. iii. 19\]: "For, behold, the day is
coming which shall burn as an oven . . . who will not leave them root or
bough." Such is the dictum of R. Eliezer. R. Joshua, however, said: They
are included, and the words, "who will not leave them root or bough,"
refer to their own bodies, as it is written \[Dan. iv. ii\]: "He called
with might, and thus he said: Hew down the tree and lop off its
branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit"; and further
\[ibid. 12\]: "Nevertheless leave the body of its roots in the earth,
but (bound) with fetters of iron and copper." As in both passages roots
are mentioned, and as the roots mentioned there refer to the trunk of
the tree, so the roots here refer to the body of man. If so, what do the
words, "who will not leave them root or bough," imply? That no reward
shall be found on which they could depend.

Others say: "They are included, and to them refers what is written \[Is.
xliv. 5\]: "This one will say, I belong to the Lord; and the other will
call himself by the name of Jacob; and the other will inscribe himself
with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel."
"This one will say, I belong to the Lord," refers to the perfectly
righteous; "and the other will call himself by the name of Jacob" refers
to the small children of the wicked; "and the other will inscribe
himself

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

with his hand unto the Lord" refers to the wicked who left off their
wickedness, turned back, and repented; and, "and surname himself by the
name of Jacob" refers to proselytes.

Korah and his company have no share in the world to come, and are not
judged, as it is written \[Numb. xvi. 33\]: "And the earth closed over
them, and they disappeared from the midst of the congregation." Such is
the decision of R. Eliezer. R. Joshua, however, said: "They are
included, and the words, 'The Lord killeth, and maketh alive: he
bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up' \[I Samuel, ii. 6\], have
reference to them, because here is mentioned the grave, as it is written
\[Numb. xvi. 33\]: 'And they went down, they and all they that
appertained to them, alive into the pit.' <span
id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_79.md) Also there it is mentioned. in both cases
the bringing up from the grave is included." Said R. Eliezer to him: "If
so, how are we to understand, 'And the earth closed over them and they
disappeared from the midst of the congregation'?" He answered: "We are
to understand that they disappeared from the midst of the congregation,
but not from the world to come."

The generation of the desert have no share in the world to come, and are
not judged, as it is written \[ibid. xiv. 35\]: "In this wilderness
shall they be spent, and therein shall they die"; and further \[Ps. xcv.
ii\]: "So that I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my
rest." Such is the dictum of R. Eliezer. R. Joshua, however, said: "They
are included, and the words, 'Gather together unto me my pious servants,
who make a covenant with me by sacrifice' \[Ps. l. 5\], have reference
to them." Said R. Eliezer to him: "If so, how dost thou explain the
words, 'so that I sware in my wrath'?" He answered that this had
reference to the spies, and all equally wicked of that generation.
"But," continued R. Joshua, "I am anxious to know how thou dost apply
the words: 'Gather together.'" "I apply them," said the other, "to
Moses, Aaron, the pious of the generation, and the tribe of Levi." R.
Jose the Galilean said: "They are not included, for it is written
\[Numb. xiv. 35\]: 'In this wilderness shall they be spent, and therein
shall they die'; and further \[Deut. xxi. 4\]: 'And they shall break
there the neck of the heifer in the valley.' As the word 'there'
mentioned here means that it shall die and not be moved from its place,
so also the 'there' mentioned in that

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

passage means that they shall die and not be moved from their places."
An objection was raised, namely: Is in that passage the word "there"
mentioned in connection with the wicked only, and not with the upright?
Is it not said \[Gen. xlix. 31\]: "*There* they buried Abraham and Sarah
his wife"; and further \[ibid. 5\]: "In my grave, which I have dug for
me in the land of Canaan, *there* shalt thou bury me"; and also \[Numb.
xx. 1\]: "And Miriam died *there* and was buried *there*"; and further
\[ibid. xxxiii. 38\]: "And Aaron the priest went up . . . and died
*there*"; and further \[Deut. xxxiv. 5\]: "And Moses the servant of the
Lord died there in the land of Moab, according to the order of the
Lord"? Said Rabban Gamaliel: It is written \[Deut. xi. 21\]: "In order
that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children in the
land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them." It
refers to the resurrection, when the parents and the children both will
enjoy the same longevity. R. Jose the Galilean sides with R. Eliezer,
and R. Gamaliel sides with R. Joshua.

The ten tribes have no share in the world to come, and are not judged,
as it is written \[Deut. xxix. 27\]: "And the Lord plucked them out of
their land . . . and he cast them into another land, as it is this day."
Said R. Simeon b. Jacob: "As the day in which they have rebelled will
never return, even so will they not return." R. Aqiba, however, said:
"As the day is first dark and then lightens up, so also their darkness
will be followed by light."

The following seven have no share in the world to come: A scribe, a
teacher of little children, even the best of physicians, the city judge,
the store-keeper, the beadle, and the butcher.

There are three kings and four commoners who have no share in the world
to come. The three kings are: Jeroboam, Achab, and Menasseh; the, four
commoners are: Balaam, Doeg, Achitophel, and Gechazi. Said R. Jehudah:
Menasseh has already repented, as it is written \[II Chron. xxxiii.
13\]: "And he prayed unto him, and he permitted himself to be entreated
by him . . . and brought him back to Jerusalem, unto his kingdom." They
argued against him thus: "Had the verse stated merely, 'and brought him
back to Jerusalem,' we would then agree with thee, but since it is
added, 'unto his kingdom,' it can be said that He returned him to His
kingdom, but not to a life in the world to come."

Said R. Meir: "Absalom has no share in the world to come."

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Said R. Simeon b.
Elazar: "Achaz, Achaziah, and all the kings of Israel who were wicked
have no share in the world to come." Said R. Johnan b. Nuri: "Also one
who pronounces the Name as it is written has no share in the world to
come."

He used to say: "One who scans the Song of Songs (like a secular poem),
and one who cannot speak above whispering or has turned yellow in
consequence of a wound or recites (in ridicule) the passage, 'I will put
none of those diseases upon them,' etc. \[Gen. xv. 26\], has no share in
the world to come." And the sages say: Every disciple who has studied,
and then abandons his studies, has no share in the world to come, as it
is written \[Numb. xv. 31\]: "Because the word of the Lord hath he
despised"; and further \[Jer. ii. 5\]: "What fault did your fathers find
in me, that they went away far from me?"

R. Meir said: "Whoever does not visit the college which is in his city
has no share in the world to come"; and R. Aqiba said: "Also those who
do not serve the sages."

MISHNA *I*. Seven things mark the clod, <span
id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_80.md) and seven there are for the sage. The wise
man does not speak before those who surpass him in wisdom and years; he
does not interrupt another in his speech, he is not hasty in answering;
he does not ask questions rashly; asks with propriety and to the point;
speaks first upon the matter first in order, and last upon last; when he
does not understand the matter under discussion, he confesses, "I do not
understand it"; and admits it when he has been convinced. The opposite
of these things mark the clod.

Tosephtha--Aboth of R. Nathan.

 <span id="fr_83"></span>[2](#fn_81.md)There are seven creations of as many
grades of importance. The sky is very important; but more important are
the stars, because they light up the world. Of a higher grade than the
stars are the trees, because they produce fruit, and the stars do not.
More significant than the trees are the pernicious winds, because they
move hither and thither, and the trees do not. Greater than the
pernicious winds is the beast, for the beast is

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

active and eats, which the former cannot do. Of a higher kind of
development is man; for man is intellectual, and the beast is not. More
excellent than man are the ministering angels; for they are able to
traverse from one end of the world to another, which man cannot do.

Man possesses six qualifications three of which belong also to the
beast, and three to the angels: Man eats and drinks, multiplies, and
excretes just like a beast; but he is endowed with intellect, walks
erect, and speaks in the holy language, just as the angels do.

The evil spirits (Shedim; Deut. xxxii. 17) possess six qualifications
three of which belong to man, and three to the angels; namely, they eat
and drink, multiply, and die as men do; but they have wings, a knowledge
of the future, and traverse from one end of the world to another, just
as the angels do. <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_82.md) There are others
who say: They also can assume any shape and form they like, and see but
are not seen.

The rabbis taught: <span id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_83.md) There are seven
sorts of hypocrites (who try to show themselves as if they were of the
true Pharisees), and they are: Shichmi; Niqpi; Qoosai; Medukhia; "What
more is my duty, and I will do it?"; Pharisee of love; and Pharisee of
fear.

Shichmi--*i.e.*, who acts like Shechem (Gen. xxxiv.), (who allowed
himself to be circumcised, not to please God but for his own benefit).
*Niqpi*--*i.e.*, one who walks tiptoe (so that he strikes his feet
against stones or other obstacles in the way), in order to show his
meekness and thereby attract attention. *Qoosai*--*i.e.*, one who shows
himself as walking with his eyes shut in order not to look upon women,
and strikes his head against a wall and bleeds. Such is the
interpretation of R. Nahman b. Itz'hak. *Medukhia*--*i.e.*, who so bends
his body while walking that he resembles a pestle. Such is the
interpretation of Rabba b. Shila. "*What more is my duty*," etc. Why is
this hypocrisy? It means that he is boasting of having done every
possible good thing, and challenges that he shall be told what more
there is to be done and he will do it. "*Pharisee of love*," etc. Abayi
and Rabha both said to the scholar who repeated

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

this: "Do not place love and fear with the hypocrites, as R. Jehudah
said in the name of Rabh: 'Always shall one occupy himself with Torah
and merits even not for the sake of Heaven, for once he makes it his
custom to do so he will finally come to do it for the sake of Heaven.'"

Said R. Nahman b. Itz'hak: "That which is hidden (in one's heart) is
only so from human beings, but not from Heaven; and even visible
hypocrisy can only be punished by the Upper Court." Said Janai the king
to his wife: "Do not fear of the Pharisees, neither of those who claim
to be their opponents; but do fear of the colored ones (who put on false
colors), who in reality act like Zimri (Numb. xxv.), and demand the
reward of Phinehas."

There are seven things which, if used moderately, are wholesome to the
body, and if in excess, are the reverse: Wine, work, sleep, wealth,
travel, warm water, and the letting of blood.

With seven things God created the world. They are as follows: Wisdom,
understanding, knowledge, strength, might, kindness, and mercy. And as
He has created the world with seven things, so also has He created seven
ancestors--three fathers and four mothers.

Seven attributes are serving before the Throne of Grace, viz.: Faithful,
Righteous, Justice, Kind, Merciful, Truth, Peace, as it is written
\[Hosea, ii. 21, 22\]: "And I will betroth thee unto me for ever: yea, I
will betroth thee in righteousness, and in justice, and in
loving-kindness, and in mercy. And I will betroth thee unto me in
faithfulness; and thou shalt know the Lord"; and further \[Ps. lxxxv.
11\]: "Kindness and truth are encountered together; righteousness and
peace kiss each other." And what signifies, "and thou shalt know the
Lord"? Any one who is possessed of these attributes has a knowledge of
the wisdom of the Omnipotent.

There are seven dwelling-places: The high, the low, the atmosphere, and
the four winds. Said R. Meir: There are seven heavens: Curtain,
firmament, welkin, dwelling-house, habitation, settled place, nebulæ.
Accordingly the earth has seven names: Land, earth, realm, dry land,
globe, and nether world. Why is it so named? Because it is seasoned with
every thing. Others say, because it destroys all.

"*A wise man does not speak before those who surpass him in wisdom and
years*." This refers to Moses, as it is written \[Ex. iv. 30\]: "And
Aaron spoke all the words which the Lord had

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

spoken unto Moses, and he did the signs before the eyes of the people."
Now, then, who of the two was competent to speak? Naturally, Moses; for
he had the message direct from God, and Aaron only heard it from Moses.
But Moses considered that it was not seemly to speak in the presence of
his elder brother; he therefore conferred upon Aaron the honor of being
speaker.

"*Does not interrupt*," etc.--refers to Aaron, as it is written \[Lev.
x. 19\]: "And Aaron spoke unto Moses: Behold, this day have they offered
their sin-offering, and their burnt-offering," etc. He was silent till
Moses ceased speaking, and did not even say to Moses to be brief in his
utterances. There are others who say that Aaron took him aside and said:
"My brother Moses, tithes, which are less important than any other
offering, a mourner (before the burial of the dead) is prohibited from
eating them; a sin-offering, which is of great importance, so much the
more should it be forbidden to him." And Moses at once admitted that he
was right, as it is written \[ibid. 20\]: "And when Moses heard this, it
was pleasing in his eyes," and in the eyes of the Mightiness.

"And he was angry with Elazar and Ithamar the sons of Aaron" \[ibid.
16\]. Learn from this that when one teaches his disciples he usually
keeps his eyes on the great one, and when he is angry, he turns his
anger to the one who is least: for he was angry even with Aaron.

Aaron was older than Moses, and the Lord is greater than Aaron, and why
did He not speak to Aaron? Because his other sons did not prevent Nadab
and Abihu from committing a sin.

We find with Abraham our father, when he was praying for the men of
Sodom, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: "If I find in Sodom fifty
righteous within the city, then will I spare the whole place for their
sake" \[Gen. xviii. 26\]. The One who said: "There shall be the world,"
very well knew that there were not in Sodom even four or five righteous,
only He waited till Abraham finished, and then answered him, as it is
written \[ibid. 33\]: "And the Lord went away when he had finished
speaking with Abraham; and Abraham returned unto his place."

"*He is not hasty in answering*"--refers to Elihu the son of Barachel
the Buzite, as it is written \[Job, xxxii. 7\]: "I had said, Days shall
speak." Infer from this that they were sitting silently before Job. When
he rose, they also arose; when he sat down, they did likewise; when he
ate or drank, they did as he did, until Job asked their permission to
speak, as it is writ

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

ten \[ibid. iii. 1-3\]: "And after this time job opened his mouth, and
cursed his day. . . . Let that day whereon I was born perish, and the
night when it was said, There hath been a male child conceived." The
night when my mother came to my father and told him that she was
pregnant shall perish. And whence do we know that they did not all speak
at once? As it is written \[ibid. 2\]: "And Job commenced, and said";
and, "Then answered Eliphaz the Themanite, and said" \[ibid. iv. 1\];
and, "Then answered Bildad the Shuchite, and said" \[ibid. viii. 1\];
and, "Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said" \[ibid. xi. 1\];
and, "And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite commenced, and said"
\[ibid. xxxii. 6\]. Scripture has enumerated them one by one for the
purpose of informing all who come into the world that the wise does not
speak before one who is greater than he.

"*And does not interrupt another in his speech; asks with
propriety*"--refers to Jehudah, as it is written \[Gen. xliii. 9\]: "I
will be surety for him."

"*Asks unwarranted*"--refers to Reuben, as it is written \[ibid. xlii.
37\]: "And Reuben said unto his father, thus: Two of my sons shalt thou
slay."

"*Speaks first upon the matter which is first in order*,"--etc. refers
to Jacob. Others say to Rebecca, and still others say to the men of
Haran.

"*And says: 'I have not heard it,' when he actually did not
hear*"--refers to Moses, as it is written \[Numb. ix. 7, 8\]: "And these
men said unto him . . . and Moses said unto them, Wait ye, and I will
hear what the Lord," etc.

"*Admits the truth*"--also refers to Moses, as it is written \[Lev. x.
20\]: "And when Moses heard this, it was pleasing in his eyes." Also the
Holy One, blessed be He, confessed to the truth, as it is written
\[Numb. xxvii. 7\]: "The daughters of Zelophchad speak rightly."

MISHNA *J*. Seven kinds of punishments come on account of seven cardinal
transgressions. When some men tithe, and some do not tithe, dearth comes
from drought; some of them are hungry, and some of them are satiated.
When they have not tithed at all, a dearth comes from tumult and from
drought. And when they have not separated the first dough, a deadly
dearth comes.

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

MISHNA *K*. Pestilence comes unto the world for the capital crimes
mentioned in the Torah, which are not to be brought before the
tribunal, <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_84.md) and for the seventh-year
fruits.

MISHNA *L*. The sword comes upon the world for suppression or perversion
of judgment, and also for false interpretation of the Law.

MISHNA *M*. Noisome beasts come into the world for vain swearing, and
for profanation of the Name. Captivity comes upon the world for
idolatry, for incest and for shedding of blood, and for not observing
the Sabbatical year.

MISHNA *N*. At four seasons the pestilence waxes: in the fourth year, in
the Sabbatical year; at the ending of the latter, and at the ending of
the Feast in every year--in the fourth, on account of the poor's tithe
in the third; in the seventh, on account of the poor's tithe in the
sixth; and at the ending of the seventh, on account of the fruit of the
Sabbatical year; and at the ending of the feast in every year, on
account of the largesses of the poor.

Tosephtha--Aboth of R. Nathan.

 <span id="fr_87"></span>[2](#fn_85.md)"*Seven kinds of chastisements*,"
etc. Said R. Jose: Because of the sin of the first dough, there is no
blessing in the fruit, and the people are delivered into the hands of
their enemies, as it is written \[Lev. xxvi. 16\]: "And ye shall sow in
vain your seed; for your enemies shall eat it." For the sin of offerings
and tithes the heavens withheld the rain and dew, as it is written
\[Job, xxiv. 19\]: "Drought and heat speedily consume the snow waters,"
etc.

A plague comes to the world because of the sin of gleanings, forgotten
sheaves, the corners and the tithes for the poor.

It happened that a woman who was the neighbor of a landowner sent her
two children to glean in his field, but he did not

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

let them. In their absence their mother wished that they return home,
thinking they might bring something to eat; and they, too, wished to
return home, thinking that their mother might have something to give
them to eat. Coming home empty-handed and finding nothing at home to
eat, the disappointment and the sorrow all around were so great that all
three died in one day. Said the Lord: Ye took away their lives, I also
will take away your lives, as it is written \[Prov. xxii. 22, 23\]: "Rob
not the poor, because he is poor, neither crush the afflicted in the
gate; for the Lord will plead their cause, and despoil the life of those
that despoil them."

"*The sword comes upon the world*," etc. When R. Simeon b. Gamaliel and
R. Ishmael b. Elisha the high-priest were seized and condemned to die,
and the former was wondering and saying: "Woe to us, that we are to be
slain as intentional violators of the Sabbath, idolaters, uncoverers of
consanguinity, or blood-shedders." Said the latter to him: "Dost thou
desire that I shall say something before thee?" And he answered: "Say!"
Whereupon he said: "Mayhap when thou wert dining poor people came to thy
door, but were forbidden to enter by the doorkeeper?" And R. Simeon
answered: "By heaven, this was not done. On the contrary, watchmen were
placed at my door: when they saw the poor approaching, they brought them
to my table and were given food and drink, and they blessed heaven."
"Perhaps when thou wert sitting at the Temple mount and lecturing, and
all the multitudes of Israel were sitting before thee, thou hadst become
haughty for a moment?" "No, my brother Ishmael, I have never done that;
but man should be prepared for affliction (without any reason
whatever)."

They then beseeched the executioner in the following manner: One said:
"I am a priest, the son of a high-priest. Kill me first, and spare me
the pain of seeing my colleague die." And the other said: "I am a
prince, the son of a prince. Kill me first, and spare me the pain of
seeing my colleague die." And he advised them to cast lots. They did so,
and it fell on Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel. Whereupon the executioner took
the sword and cut off his head. R. Ishmael held it to his bosom, and
wept and cried: "The holy mouth, the truthful mouth, a mouth whence
issued precious stones, diamonds, and pearls, who has hidden thee in the
dust, and who has filled thy tongue with dust and ashes? Thou art meant
in the prophetic exclamation

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[Zech. xiii. 7\]:
'Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man whom I have
associated with me.'" Scarcely had he finished when also his head was
struck off. To them Scripture refers when it is said \[Ex. xxii. 23\]:
"My wrath shall wax hot, and I will slay you with the sword; and your
wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless." As the men are
slain, is it not self-evident that the women become widows? (Why, then,
does Scripture say: "And your wives shall be widows"?) To convey the
idea that they were and were not widows; *i.e.*, there was no evidence
that the men were killed, as it happened in Bythar, where not a soul
escaped to give evidence of any man's death, and consequently the women
could not marry again. "And the children shall become fatherless" means
that they could not inherit the property of their father, for the same
reason.

"*Captivity comes upon the world*," etc. Because of idolatry, as it is
written \[Lev. xxvi. 30\]: "And I will destroy your high places and
\[ibid. 33\]: "And you will I scatter among the nations and further
\[Deut. iv. 25\]: "When thou begettest children," etc.; and \[ibid.
27\]: "And the Lord will scatter you among the nations"; and \[ibid.
28\]: "And ye will serve their gods, the work of man's hands." The Holy
One, blessed be He, said: "As you are desirous of being idolatrous, I
will exile you to a place where idolatry prevails."

For not observing the Sabbatical year. Whence do we know this? It is
written \[Lev. xxvi. 34\]: "Then shall the land satisfy its Sabbaths,"
etc. Said the Holy One, blessed be He: "Because ye do not observe the
Sabbatical year, the land itself will observe it; and the number of
months that ye fail to observe it, the land itself will observe it." For
that reason it is written \[ibid.\]: "Then shall the land satisfy its
Sabbaths, all the days of its desolation."

Tosephtha--Aboth of R. Nathan.

 <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_86.md)Five are not to be forgiven: The one
who sins relying that he will repent, and repents and sins again (and
thus he sins too much and repents too much); the one who sins relying
upon the forgiveness of the day of atonement; and the one who instigates
others to sin; and the one who is guilty of profaning the Holy

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Name. And were it
not for the sins of mankind, the keys to the mysteries would have been
intrusted to man, and he would know by what means earth and heaven were
created and also what there is above. R. Aqiba used to say: "Everything
is foreseen and unconcealed, and everything is according to one's
understanding." He also used to say that everything was given as a
pledge, and a net is spread out for all living, etc. The repentance of
the wicked delays the execution of their judgment; their verdict,
however, remains sealed until they make restitution. The quietness of
the wicked (without having remorse) ends badly. Superiority buries its
claimers.

A man arrives into this world naked and leaves it in the same state, and
it is desirable that the leaving should be as (sinless) as the coming.
For profaning the Holy Name there is no repentance pending, and the Day
of Atonement does not forgive. Repentance forgives till the day of
death, and that day wipes out (all sin). The wicked are paid (in this
world) and the upright are given credit (that is to say, the wicked that
have studied the Law without performing what is written therein and
otherwise have done nothing good, and those upright that have studied
the Law with a good intention and have done no evil--these and those are
given a small portion of what they earned), and the greater part is
counted to them for the future.

R. Elazar b. Zadoq says: The upright in this world can be compared with
a tree whose trunk grows on a clean spot, while one of its branches
extends over an unclean spot, of which people say: Cut off the branch,
and the whole tree will be on a clean spot. The wicked ones can be
compared with a tree standing on an unclean spot and extending its
branches to a clean spot, in which case, if the branches would be cut
off, the whole tree would stand on an unclean spot.

Six different names were applied to the lion: Arjah, Cphir, Lobhi,
Laish, Sha'hal, Sha'haz. Six names were applied to the serpent; viz.,
Na'hash, Soroph, Tanin, Ziphoni, Epheh, Achshubh. Six names were applied
to Solomon; namely, Solomon, Jedidiah, Koeleth, Ben Iokoh, Ogur, L'muel.

MISHNA *O*. Four kinds of views are held by men concerning property. He
who says: "What belongs to me shall continue to be mine, and thou shalt
keep thine own," holds the common view. Some consider this the view of

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

the men of Sodom. <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_87.md) "Mine shall be
thine, and thine shall be mine," thus say the ignorant. "Mine shall be
thine, and thou shalt also keep thine own," thus says the magnanimous.
"Thine shall be mine, and mine shall continue to be mine," are the words
of the godless.

MISHNA *P*. There are four kinds of dispositions among men. Some are
easily enraged, but as quickly soothed--there the fault is neutralized
by the merit. Some are slow to anger, but are calmed only with
difficulty--there the merit is counterbalanced by the fault. One is slow
to anger and easily pacified--he is of a gentle disposition. Another is
easily irritated and hard to soothe--he is a wicked man.

MISHNA *Q*. There are four kinds of pupils: one understands readily but
forgets soon--there the advantage is swallowed by the failing; another
grasps but slowly, and seldom forgets--there the failing is outweighed
by the talent; a third understands readily and is slow to forget--his is
a good portion; a fourth understands slowly and forgets quickly--his is
a poor endowment.

MISHNA *R*. There are four kinds of charity-givers: He who gives but
does not care that others should give--his eye is evil towards others
(*i.e.*, the charity-giver shall not have the pleasure of doing charity
and the poor shall be deprived of it); he who makes others give, but
does not give himself, does not make the best use of his own; he who
gives, and makes others give, is pious; but he who neither gives nor
suffers others to give is a cruel man.

MISHNA *S*. There are four kinds of visitors of the house of learning:
he that goes and does not practise (*i.e.*, he accepts the lessons
without any examination or study of them), the reward of going only
remains with him; he that practises (*i.e.*, he who studies at home) and
does not go, the reward of practice remains with him; he

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

that does both is pious; he that enrols among the college visitors, but
neither goes nor practises, is wicked.

MISHNA *T*. There are four kinds of the disciples of the wise: sponge,
funnel, strainer, and sieve; sponge--sucking up all things;
funnel--allowing all that is received in the one end to flow out at the
other; strainer--letting the wine run through and retaining the dregs;
sieve--blowing off the bran and keeping the flour.

MISHNA *U*. Love, inspired by ulterior motives, dies out when those
motives disappear; but love without such motives never fades.

MISHNA *V*. What love is that which is inspired by ulterior motives?
*E.g.* the love of Amnon and Thamar. And what love is without such
motives? *E.g.*, the love of David and Jonathan.

MISHNA *W*. Whatsoever gainsaying is for the sake of Heaven will have
good results, and that which is not for the sake of Heaven will not have
the desired result.

MISHNA *X*. What gainsaying is that which is for the sake of Heaven?
*E.g.*, the gainsaying of Hillel and Shammai. And that which is not for
the sake of Heaven? *E.g.*, the gainsaying of Korah and his followers.

MISHNA *Y*. Whosoever causes many to be righteous, sin prevails not over
him; and whosoever causes many to sin, they grant him not the faculty to
repent.

MISHNA *Z*. Moses, who was righteous and caused many to become
righteous, the righteousness of the many was therefore laid upon him, as
it is written \[Deut. xxxiii. 21\]: "He executed the justice of the
Lord, and his judgment with Israel."

Jeroboam, who on the contrary sinned and caused many to sin, the sin of
the many, therefore, was laid upon him, as it is written \[I Kings xiv.
16\]: "For the sake of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who
induced Israel to sin."

MISHNA *AA*. In whomsoever are the following three things, he is a
disciple of Abraham, and in whomsoever are the contrary three things, he
is a disciple of Balaam.

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

MISHNA *BB*. He who possesses a good eye, a modest spirit, and a humble
mind is to be counted the disciple of Abraham our father; an evil eye, a
haughty spirit, and a bombastic mind is to be counted the disciple of
Balaam. And what difference is there between the disciples of Abraham
and those of Balaam? The disciples of Balaam go down to Gehenna, as it
is written \[Ps. lv. 24\]: "But thou, O God, thou wilt bring them down
into the pit of destruction: let not the men of blood and deceit live
out half their days; but I will indeed trust in thee." But the disciples
of Abraham derive benefit in this world and inherit the world to come,
as it is written \[Prov. viii. 21\]: "That I may cause those that love
me to inherit a lasting possession; and their treasures will I fill."

MISHNA *CC*. Jehudah b. Tema was in the habit of saying: "Be courageous
as the panther, light-winged as the eagle, swift as the deer, and strong
as the lion, to execute the will of thy Heavenly Father."

MISHNA *DD*. He used to say: "Gehenna will be the place for the bold of
face, and the Garden of Eden will be that for the shamefaced."

MISHNA *EE*. He used to say: "One five years old should study Scripture;
ten years--Mishna; thirteen years--should practise the commandments;
fifteen years old--should study Gemara; eighteen years old--the bridal;
at twenty--pursuits; at thirty--strength; at forty--discernment; at
fifty--counsel; at sixty--age; at seventy--hoariness; at eighty--power;
at ninety--decrepitude; at one hundred--it is as though he were dead and
gone and had ceased from the world."

MISHNA *FF*. Ben Bag-Bag said: "Turn it, and turn it again (the Torah),
for everything can be found therein. Study it, get old and gray with it,
and never depart from it; for there is no better gauge of a moral life
than--the Torah."

MISHNA *GG*. Ben He-He said: "The reward is commensurate with the
affliction."
