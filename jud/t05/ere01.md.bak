# TRACT DERECH ERETZ--RABBA. (WORLDLY AFFAIRS.)

## CHAPTER II. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)

THE Sadducees, the common informers, the wicked, the hypocrites, the
heretics, of them the Scripture says \[Job, xiii. 16\]: "For a hypocrite
cannot come before him"; the terrifying, the overbearing, the haughty,
the barefaced, those who develop only their muscular strength, of them
the Scripture says \[Psalms, xxxvii. 17\]: "For the ovens of the wicked
shall be broken; but the upholder of the righteous is the Lord."
Evil-thinkers, story-tellers, talebearers, smooth-tongued persons, of
them the Scripture says \[ibid. xxxv. 5\]: "May their way be dark and
slippery, and may the angel of the Lord pursue them." Those who assault
their neighbor in private and those who insult him in public, those who
trifle with majorities, and those who cause quarrels, they will become
as Korah and his society, of whom the Scripture says \[Numb. xvi. 33\]:
"And the earth closed over them, and they disappeared from the midst of
the congregation." Those who forestall fruit, those who raise the
prices, those who diminish the measure, those who accept payment in
large-sized shekels, and those who live on usury, of them the Scripture
says \[Amos, viii. 7\]: "Sworn hath the Lord by the excellency of Jacob.
Surely I will not forget to eternity all their works."

The following leave no inheritance to their children,

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

and if they do leave to their children, nothing of it comes to their
grandchildren: viz., those who play at dice, and those who raise tender
cattle (in Palestine); those who do business with the money obtained
from the fruit of the Sabbatical year, and those who pay with coins (of
doubtful genuineness) coming from the sea-countries, and a priest and a
Levite who obtained advances on their shares (of heave-offering and
tithes), and those who disgrace the Holy Name, of them the Scripture
says \[Ps. ix. 18\]: "The wicked shall return into hell, all the nations
that are forgetful of God." And of them it is also written \[Eccles. i.
15\]: "What is crooked cannot be made straight." Those who motion with
their hands, stamp their feet, walk on their toes (to show pride), of
them the Scripture says \[Ps. xxxvi. 12\]: "Let not come against me the
foot of pride, and let not the hand of the wicked chase me off." The
conceited, the slanderers, those who indulge in obscene language, those
who are wise in their own eyes, of them the Scripture says \[Mal. iii.
19\]: "For, behold, the day is coming which shall burn as an oven," etc,

One who lets his young son marry an older woman, and one who marries off
his daughter to an old man, and one who bestows favors upon those who
are unworthy, concerning such Scripture says \[Deut. xxix. 19\]: "The
Lord will not pardon him." The collectors, the war-instigators, the
publicans, of them Scripture says \[Ezek. xxvii. 27\]: "Thy wealth and
thy warehouses, thy commerce, thy mariners and thy pilots, thy caulkers
and the conductors of thy commerce, and all thy men of war that were in
thee, and in all thy assemblage which was in the midst of thee, fell
into the heart of the seas on the day of thy downfall." One who betrays
his partner, one who does not return a thing found to its rightful
owner, one who loans money to another in order to get possession of his
house or fields in case of non-payment, and one who lives immorally with
his wife, and one who maliciously

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

slanders his wife in order to divorce her, of them the Scripture says
\[Jer. xvii. 10\]: "I the Lord search the heart, probe the veins."

Those who are wronged and do not wrong, etc. \[see Yomah, p. 33, l. 9\];
those who consider themselves contemptible and despicable, those who
overcome their passion, and are altogether modest, of them the Scripture
says \[Is. xlix. 8\]: "Thus hath said the Lord, In the time of favor
have I answered thee, and on the day of salvation have I helped thee,
and I will preserve thee, and I will appoint thee as a people of my
covenant to raise up the land, to divide out desolate heritages."
Trustworthy men, those who keep other people's secrets, those who gladly
return articles intrusted to their care, and found things to their
rightful owners, of them Scripture says \[Ps. ci. 6\]: "My eyes shall be
upon the faithful of the land, that they may abide with me." One who
loves his wife as himself, who honors her more than himself, and one who
leads his children on the right path, and one who marries off his son in
due time to prevent him from sin, of them it is written \[Job, v. 24\]:
"And thou shalt know that there is peace in thy tent; and thou wilt look
over thy habitation, and shalt miss nothing. And thou shalt know that
thy seed is numerous, and thy offspring as the herbage of the earth."

One who loves his neighbors and is friendly to his relatives, and one
who marries off his sister's daughter, and one who loans even a small
amount to a poor man in his need, <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) of
them the Scripture says \[Is. lviii. 9\]: "Then shalt thou call, and the
Lord will answer."

One who executes his trust rightfully, <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md)
those who truthfully repent, and those who receive the repentant into
their midst and instruct them so that they shall not

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

return to their former sins, of them it is written \[ibid. 8\] Then
shall break forth as the morning-dawn thy light.

Those who judge rightfully, those who reprove truthfully, those who
propagate purity, and those who are pure of heart, of them it is written
\[Ps. lxxiii. 1\]: "Truly, God is good to Israel, to such as are pure of
heart." Those who sigh, weep, and in their lamentations are hopeful of
the redemption of Jerusalem, of them it is written \[Is. lxi. 3\]: "To
grant unto the mourners of Zion, to give unto them ornament in the place
of ashes." Those who are merciful, feed the hungry, quench the thirst of
the thirsty, clothe the naked, and distribute charity, of them the
Scripture says \[ibid. iii. 10\]: "Say ye to the righteous that he hath
done well." The poor, the bashful, and those who are humble in spirit,
and those who are submissive to youth, and those who carry out their
promises, of them the Scripture says \[Job, xxii. 23\]: "And if thou
decree a thing, it will be fulfilled unto thee, and upon thy ways the
light will shine." Those who exert themselves in the study of the Law,
and study it for the purpose of observing it, and those who search for
the opportunity to do good, and those who frequent the temples, of them
the Scripture says \[Prov. viii. 24\]: "Happy is the man that hearkeneth
unto me, watching day by day at my gates, waiting at the posts of my
doors." Those who pursue righteousness, and seek peace for their nation,
and those who participate in the affliction of the community, and those
who stand by the community in case of distress, of them the Scripture
says \[Nahum, i. 7\]: "The Lord is good, a stronghold on the day of
distress."

On account of the following four things an eclipse of the sun occurs
(see Succah, p. 40): When the head of a college (Ab Beth Din) died and
was not properly lamented; when a betrothed damsel cried for help (Deut.
xxii. 23-28) in town and no one offered help; male sodomy; and the
shedding of the blood of two brothers at one and the same time (there is
no explanation of this

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

in any of the commentaries, and it seems to us that there happened
something like that in the author's time which is unknown to us).

On account of the following four things the eclipse of both the sun and
the moon occurs: Those who write defamatory reports about others, giving
false testimony, raising tender cattle, and destroying fruit-bearing
trees. On account of the following four things the personal property of
citizens is seized by the government: For keeping paid notes (with the
intention to demand another payment), for the practice of usury, for not
exercising one's power to prevent sin when he could do so, for
subscribing publicly to charity and not paying the subscription.

On account of the following four things the estates of the citizen are
destroyed: For robbing or withholding the wages of a wage-earner \[Lev.
xix. 13\]; for removing the yoke from one's own neck and placing it upon
the neck of another, and for haughtiness above all.

R. Dusthai b. R. Jehudah said: Do provoke the wicked (see Megilla, p.
13), as it is written \[Prov. xxviii. 41: "They that forsake the law
praise the wicked, but such as observe the law *contend* with them"; but
lest one say, is it not written \[Ps. xxxvii. 1\]: "*Do not* fret
thyself because of the evil-doers, neither be thou envious against the
workers of iniquity"? say to him that this is the answer of him whose
heart-beating prevents him from doing so (because of this passage), but
the true interpretation of this passage is thus: "Do not fret thyself
*to be* equal to the evil-doers, neither be thou envious to be like them
of the workers of iniquity."

There is no sitting above (in heaven), neither is there eating,
drinking, sleep, multiplication, animosity, hatred, provocation, envy,
nor stubbornness, weariness nor delay, and that is what David the King
of Israel said \[ibid. xviii. 12\]: "He made darkness his hiding-place"
(*i.e.*, it is dark and hidden to all mortals). To what end did David

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

say this? To none other than to praise of the Holy One, blessed be He,
who is "Yah," rules on high, whose unity is one, whose name is one, and
who rests in three hundred and ninety heavens, and on each His name and
mode of pronunciation are marked; and in each of them there are
servants, seraphim, *ophanim* (wheels, Ezek. I.), cherubim, *galgalim*,
and a throne of glory; and there is no wonder at that, for even as a
mortal king has many palaces for the seasons of the year, so much the
more the Everlasting, since all is His. And when Israel are doing His
will, He rests in the seventh heaven, named Araboth, and does not keep
distant from His world, as it is written \[Numb. vii. 89\]: "From
between the two cherubim: and thus he spake unto him." When offended He
ascends to the highest heaven, and all cries and weeping are not
listened to, and fasts are ordered, and they roll themselves in ashes,
cover themselves with sacks, and shed tears (and all in vain, until He
has mercy upon them).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[1:1](ere01.htm#fr_1.md) Chapter I. belongs to Tract
Kedushin, and will be added to that tract.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[3:1](ere01.htm#fr_2.md) Some say it means when the
lender himself is in need, and it seems to us that it is the correct
meaning.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[3:2](ere01.htm#fr_3.md) The text reads "Hamnadin,"
which means "those who put under the ban," but the commentators came to
the conclusion that this is an error. We have translated it according to
Elias Wilna.
