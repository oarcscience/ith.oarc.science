### THE PROPHECY OF THE NEW YEAR

##### HOW RABBI ISRAEL SOUGHT TO BRING HEAVEN DOWN UPON EARTH

<span class="smallcaps">Little</span> by little Rabbi Israel had given
Power out of himself, that the weaker might be sustained. The well of
his Force was deep, and might never become dry, yet the Power was not in
him now as in earlier years. His soul went no more into Heaven, and yet
he yearned for Heaven.

Then he desired to bring down Heaven on earth.

Though he knew the time had not yet come, he could not restrain his
desire, and all of the strength that remained in him gathered and
mounted for that attempt.

 

The pale first sun of the new year hung far in the midst of grey heaven,
and the air was filled with the sound of the ram's horn blown in trumpet
call. Some thought they could even see the sounds of the trumpet
spreading in a faint glowing orbit through the greyness of the autumn
day, as the call went forward.

The students sat about the long ancient table in the house of the Baal
Shem Tov. Today it seemed to root its gnarled feet into the very ground,
and take a new hold on life. Some of the students looked out into the
halo of spreading light, and some sat staring at the blackened walls, as
though the next instant the walls must draw aside and reveal the Empire
of Mystery.

The prayer was ended. The Master began to speak the sermon of the New
Year.

The students had not the strength to look into his

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

glowing face; but when they closed their eyes each of his words came
before them, and each word had a form; some were ablaze in light, some
shadow dark, and some were pure and stainless as God's love on earth.
With their eyes closed they sat, young and aged, and listened, and saw.

The voice of Rabbi Israel was ever as a gently sounded bell, though when
he uttered fullest prayer his voice became as the cry of the lark's
throat. But on the day of the New Year his voice was fresh and nimble.
The ram's horn breathed through him and became a human call. The song of
the *Tekia* knocked on the door of the soul, calling "come away"! The
wavering notes of the *Scherwarim* wakened the freed souls like the
freshness of day, and filled them with the tremblement of eternal
longing. The high joyous cry of the *Terua* carried them up to
Redemption.

And the Word upon which the Baal Shem spoke was the Word of the New
Year:

"Sound on the mighty trumpet the sound of our Release!"

"Sound on the mighty trumpet!" he cried to the Almighty. "When the
sphere of the year is rounded, and the souls of all things reach through
the darkness toward a new birth, sound! See, Your children are become
bitten under the assault of the storm. See, the fire of the wilderness
has left her mark on them. But now the circle of Your year closes. The
awful darkness on the other side has sent out her chill waves before
her, already we feel their approach. Sound on the mighty Trumpet, O
Lord, for the new Birth!

"Your punishment has bitten into our hand and

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

eaten out the strength of life. Your banishment has hounded our feet
until they tottered on solid earth. You sent the worm into our hearts,
and they are gnawed like withered leaves. We have felt the icy hand of
Your Will upon our foreheads, and our thoughts are stiffened and glazed.
Sound on the mighty trumpet, O Lord, for our Release!

"The Angel of the Lord took hold of me during the night and led me
outward, and I stood in nothingness, and the night lay upon my shoulders
like a great burden, and the night rolled from below my prisoned feet.
Then the Angel said, See! and the darkness faded, and I stood in a
whited nothingness, and I saw.

"There between two chasms stood a narrow circular ridge. And within the
ridge was enclosed a red depth like a sea of blood, and outside of it
was a black depth like a sea of Night. And I saw, there walked a man
upon the ridge, he walked like a blind man, with trembling feet, and his
two weak arms wavered feeling against the darkness on one side of him
and on the other; and his breast was all of glass, and I saw his heart
flutter like a sick leaf in the wind, and on his brow was the mark of
the icy Hand. The man went further and further around the ridge, without
seeing to right or to left, and he was nearly come to the end of the
circle, where his beginning had been. And I wanted to call to him, but
that which I saw stopped my tongue, and I could not move it, as though
it were stone. For suddenly the man had raised his eyes and seen what
was on the right and on the left of him, then he staggered, and from
each chasm arms reached upward to seize him.

"Then the Angel touched my lips, and my tongue

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

was free, and I called and I shouted to him, "Lift up your wings and
fly!" Then behold, the man lifted up wings! there was no more weakness
or fear in him; then the ridge faded from beneath his feet, and the
chasm of blood was dissolved in God's spring-water, and the chasm of
night melted in God's light, and the City of the Lord lay before me,
open everyways.

"Behold, the year is a circle. We go on a narrow circular ridge between
two chasms, and we do not see their depth. But when we come to the end
of the way that is also its beginning, then the trembling of fear falls
upon us as before the thunder from on high, and the lightning of the
Lord flashes over the chasm, and we see the chasm, and we quiver.

"Then the trumpet sounds over us, and takes hold of our souls and
carries them, each call of the trumpet carries myriads of souls upon its
wings! And the sounds of the trumpet leap up to Heaven, and the Heavens
listen, and fear and trembling comes over the Heavens as before the
thunder of the Lord; and the trumpet resounds! And the Trumpet of the
World carries on its wings that soul that shall be born out of all our
souls, and is the soul of Messiah. And he climbs up to the Kingdom of
Mysteries, and he beats with his wings on the Door, and the Door falls
open, and behold, there is neither door nor wall remaining, but the City
of God lies there, open everyways.

"Sound on the mighty trumpet, O Lord, for the birth of the Soul!"

 

The voice of the Baal Shem Tov was like the trumpet, until it ceased.
Then he arose from the

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

table, and went into his chamber, and locked himself there. And there he
remained, motionless in striving. For his utmost power was gone forward
in his demand, and his soul awaited surely the coming of Messiah.

And the students also arose from about the table, and went out. As
sleepwalkers they went through the streets, unseeing, and filled with
yearning. At the borders of the city there was a hut where they would
come together that they might undisturbed occupy themselves with
thoughts of the Eternal. There they now went. And the Wings of the Voice
were still over them.

But at that time there lived in the house of the Baal Shem Tov a young
boy whose name was Joseph, and who was called Yohseleh. When the Master
had gone into his chamber, and the students had all gone to their
cottage outside the city, the boy remained alone at the long table, for
he was too young to go with the others to their meditations. Yohseleh
remained sitting there, within the darkening walls, and he felt the
wings of the Voice upon his shoulders.

And when the first shadow of the twilight trembled goldenbrown over the
white table-cloth, Yohseleh laid his head on his hands, he was in terror
before the Will of the Voice, and he sank under the heaviness of the
wings of the Voice that were on his shoulders. His closed fingers,
pressed before his eyes, set him into deepest darkness; but in that
darkness there wakened a Light that sang with the same Voice whose will
he so feared. The Voice pressed upon Yohseleh with an irresistible
force, and like tears long held

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

back it suddenly burst forth, and Yohseleh cried, "Now and at once
Messiah must come!"

Then the room became as far away, and the walls disappeared, and before
him was a Light that gave out rings of illumination, as a night-time
sun. And Yoseleh ran toward the Light. But here was the door, like a
piercing, wakening pain. The boy stood for a second, as one on a narrow
ridge between two chasms, who suddenly sees his danger. The Lightning of
the Lord went out of him, and he was afraid, shuddering. But then the
Power seized him as with the strength of the Cherubim, and the Voice
cried, and Light fell once more into his heart and burned there. And
Yohseleh opened the door and ran out, he ran through the streets of the
city, and he ran in terrible haste until he came to the cottage of the
students. Here his feet stopped. And his throat split open, and he
cried, "Messiah!"

But there was no loud voice about him; only his own voice sounded and
resounded slowly, and lived, and was like the Voice whose Wings he had
felt upon his shoulders.

He forced his eyes to open, and made himself see.

There the aged ones sat on the threshold of the house, in a long, curved
row, and every mouth was hard closed, and every look was far in the
horizon, and not a limb moved.

Then Yohseleh heard his own voice crying, "Now and at once Messiah
comes!" and he heard his own voice resounding in the midst of the
staring silence. Then the soul of the boy flew upon the Wings of the
Voice, and lay within the breast of the first of the

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

students, and Yohseleh said, "Nachum, do you still remember how you
fasted from one Sabbath to the other, that Messiah might come? Do you
still remember how I came to you when you lay on the ground on the last
day, and beat your forehead against the floor, how we cried and prayed
together then? Now see, Messiah comes!" But the other was silent.

Then the soul rose and flew to the second student, and crept into his
sleep, and Yohseleh said, "Elimelech, I saw you once bowed over a fire
until your hairs fell into the flames, and your lips uttered the name,
Messiah! I saw you once lift up your arms and shake your hands against
the heavens, and your lips uttered the name, Messiah! Elimelech, he
comes!" But the other was silent.

And again the soul went out, and flew to the third, and nestled in his
hand, and Yohseleh said, "Yehuda, I heard you once when you spoke magic
over the waters, and uttered dim words in the way of the wind. Your
magic ran with the waters, and your enchantments flew with the wind. But
now, Yehuda, hear me, now he comes, do you not hear him coming? Yehuda,
let us go and greet him!" But he also was silent.

Yohseleh looked upon these aged ones, and his soul looked on them, and
he saw them listening to a distant step. So they sat in a long, bent
row, and listened to a distant step, and looked into infinity. Then
loneliness came over Yohseleh and laid her cold hard hand upon the nape
of his neck, and the nails of the fingers sank deep into his flesh, and
the hand lay on his neck like a live, in-crawling mark. And Yohseleh saw
how the Light went out of his own heart and faded from

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

before his eyes. And Yohseleh felt how the wings upon his shoulders
shrank, and fell away. And Yohseleh wanted to speak, but no voice came
out of his throat. And Yohseleh wanted to go from there, but he could
not lift his feet. And Yohseleh sat in the row with the others, and
looked into the distance, and listened for a distant step.

So they sat together, until the stars came. And in his chamber the Baal
Shem Tov struggled to force down the presence of Messiah. And as long as
he continued the struggle, the sound of a distant step was in their
ears. But when the sun was gone, the Baal Shem was empty of strength.
And he knew that the heavens would not yield before his urge.

Then the binding power was loosed from the students. They arose, and
returned to the city.

And Yohseleh stood in his house like a blind man, with unsteady feet,
and his two hands wavered reaching out against the nothingness to left
and to right of him, and his heart trembled like a sick leaf in the
wind, and the mark of the icy hand was on his brow.
