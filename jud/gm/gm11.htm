<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Once</span>, when the Baal Shem Tov was on a journey, Sabbath overtook him on the highway. He stopped the wagon, and went out into the field to perform the services that welcome the coming of Sabbath, and to remain there until the Sabbath was ended.</p>  
<p>On the field, a flock of sheep were grazing.</p>  
<p>When the Baal Shem Tov raised his voice and spoke the prayers that welcome the Sabbath as the coming of a Bride, the sheep rose upon their hind legs, and lifted their heads in the air, and stood like people listening.</p>  
<p>And so they remained in wrapt attention for two hours, all the while that the Baal Shem spoke.</p>
