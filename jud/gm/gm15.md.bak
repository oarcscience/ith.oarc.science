### THE WATER-SPIRIT

##### HERE THE STORY IS TOLD OF THE REVENGEFUL LAKE THAT WAS ANGRY BECAUSE OF THE HIDEOUS SIN THAT HAD BEEN THROWN INTO IT, AND HOW RABBI ISRAEL SAVED THE SINNER'S SON

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> old Constantine there lived a cousin
of the Baal Shem Tov whose name was Reb Shmerl. And Reb Shmerl was a
sinner. He committed one sin after another. "What does it matter if I
sin twice or sin twenty times?" he said. "At the end of the year I take
all my sins and drag them down to the edge of the water. I throw them
into the lake, and that is the end of them. And for the new year, I am a
clean man."

So Reb Shmerl lived from year to year. And each year the sea became a
little blacker, because of the sins he threw into it, and each year the
bundle of sins that he brought down to the edge of the water was greater
than that of the year before.

"The lake is close to my house!" he laughed. "I have not far to carry my
sins! Let there be a few more in the bundle!"

But his wife said, "It is because of your sinning that God does not send
us a son." His wife was a holy woman, a Tsadeket.

Reb Shmerl said, "Do you really think that is so?"

And she said, "Yes."

Then he said, "Well, perhaps it is really so." And he thought no more
about it.

And that same year, he committed a sin that was uglier than all the sins
he had ever made. This sin was huge and shapeless, it was like a great
sponge oozing and dripping with mud. He could hardly find

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

a place to hide it until the end of the year, when he would throw it
into the lake. He put it into the basement of his house. But there, the
sin seemed to grow larger, to expand, until the basement was not high
enough to hold it, and the mud of the sin began to squeeze itself
through all the cracks and to ooze into the rooms of the house, and to
fill every corner of the house with its damp crawly smell. At last, New
Year's day came. Reb Shmerl took hold of the sin in both his arms, and
by pulling with all his might managed to squeeze it through the door of
the house. He got it out of the house, then he pushed and rolled it down
to the lake.

"There!" he said as it sank into the water. "I'm rid of that!"

The sea was angrier than ever. It hissed and shook itself and heaved
itself upward trying to hurl the sin back to the shore. Yet all of its
rebellion was of no use, for it had been ordained when the waters were
created that on New Year's they had to receive into themselves all of
the sins of men, and cleanse them. So at last the lake became quiet, and
set to work to cleanse the sin. But the deed of Reb Shmerl was not
forgotten; the waters waited for vengeance.

 

Reb Shmerl saw that his hair was becoming grey, and his wife had passed
her best years, and still they had no children. At last he said:

"I will go to my cousin Rabbi Israel. They say he performs wonders for
every stranger that comes to his door. As for me, I am a member of his
family!"

He came to the Baal Shem Tov in Medzibuz and he said, "Cousin, I am
growing old, and I would like to have a son to live after me."

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

Rabbi Israel talked with him for a while, and remembered Shmerl's wife,
the holy Tsadeket. At last the Master said, "Go home. I can only promise
you that you will have a son."

"But what more did I ask!" said Reb Shmerl; and he began to dance with
delight, but the Baal Shem shook his head.

 

The Baal Shem Tov's promise was fulfilled. Before the year was over,
Shmerl's wife gave birth to a strong and beautiful boy. The father was
so proud that he said, "I will go at once on another journey to Rabbi
Israel, and thank him for what he has done for us."

Then he came again to Medzibuz, and entered the cottage where the Master
sat studying. The Master looked up at him, and the Master's eyes were
filled with deep compassionate sorrow. When Reb Shmerl looked into the
eyes of Rabbi Israel, all his joyous words faded from his lips. He did
not know why, but he wanted to weep. Suddenly he was crying like a
child.

Then the Baal Shem Tov said to him, "Your son will grow into a strong
and happy boy. But on his thirteenth birthday he will go into the water
and drown."

Reb Shmerl cried like a woman. He fell on his knees to Rabbi Israel and
begged, "Help me."

Everyone knows that the Baal Shem Tov was not fond of weeping. But he
remembered that the man's wife was a Tsadeket. Now he lifted up his
cousin and said, "The sea is angry with you because of that terrible
black sin that you threw into it. There is only one way to save your
son. On his thirteenth birthday, he must be kept away from the water."

Reb Shmerl thanked him with all his heart. Reb

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Shmerl was filled
with joy, his tears were forgotten. "That is not difficult at all!" he
said. "On his thirteenth birthday, I will keep him away from the water!"

And he was ready to run off on his way back home.

But Rabbi Israel called to him and said, "Do not think it is so easy to
remember. You will surely forget the danger that awaits your only son!"

Reb Shmerl said, "How could I forget!"

But the Baal Shem Tov, who saw even then how it would be with Reb
Shmerl, said, "Before you go, I will give you a sign that will help you
to remember the day. When you awaken on that day, you'll begin to dress
yourself, and you'll draw two stockings onto the left foot, and then
hunt everywhere for the stocking for your right foot. Warn your
household that on the day you cannot find your stocking, something
terrible will happen."

Reb Shmerl thanked him, and returned to Constantine. And he thought,
"What a foolish thing the Rabbi said about the stockings!" So he didn't
tell anyone about it.

 

The boy grew. He was stronger than any of the other boys in old
Constantine. He could run faster, and his eyes could see further, and
his hands could move more quickly. As for learning, he had only to look
upon a page, and he remembered it.

But most of all things, he loved to swim in the water. He would dive to
the very bottom of the sea, and there he would swim around, seeking
beautiful stones. These he would bring home to his mother.

He learned to stay under the water for many minutes.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The fishes would
come in and out of his hands, playing with him.

As Reb Shmerl saw his son growing up so strong and big, he forgot all
about the gloomy warning of the Baal Shem Tov. By the time thirteen
years had passed he did not remember Rabbi Israel's prediction at all.
And he prepared to celebrate the Bar Mitzveh of his only son with a
great feast.

On the morning of the boy's thirteenth birthday, Reb Shmerl was awakened
by the heat of the sun on his face. It was hotter than it had ever been
before, he thought. He felt his whole body burning as if it were inside
a furnace.

He began to dress himself.

He felt very uncomfortable. He felt he had not slept enough. He was
angry because the sun had awakened him. And his head hurt with the heat.

He drew a stocking onto his left foot. And then he stopped to wipe the
sweat from his body. And then, without looking what he was doing, he
drew his other stocking onto his left foot. Then he looked for the
stocking for his right foot, He looked among his clothes, and did not
find it. He looked under the bed, and did not find it. He got up, and
began to hop around the room, hunting for another stocking. He stumbled
into the next room, and blundered all over the house, knocking over
chairs, and hurting his knees, and falling, and balancing himself
against the wall. And he muttered and cried with anger, because the day
was very hot, and he could not find his other stocking.

He shouted and woke his wife.

"What is the matter?" she said.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

"Where is my other stocking!" cried Reb Shmerl.

Then his wife arose, to see what was troubling him. He pointed to his
leg, and muttered, "Someone has hidden my other stocking! I can't find
my other stocking!"

The Tsadeket looked at her husband, and saw that he was wearing two
stockings on one foot, for when he went jumping around his stockings had
become loosened.

"Look, Shmerl!" she laughed, "you have them both on your left foot!"

He looked, and he saw. Then suddenly he remembered the words of Rabbi
Israel. And he began to tremble. And he ran to the room where his son
slept. The boy was not in his bed.

Reb Shmerl ran to the door. He looked through the doorway, and saw the
boy already on his way to the lake.

Reb Shmerl shouted to his son, "Come back!"

But the boy answered, "It's hot! I want to swim in the water!"

"Come back!" cried the father.

But the boy would not come back.

Then, with one foot covered and the other foot bare, Reb Shmerl began to
run after his son. The boy ran swiftly. The father saw him nearing the
lake.

"Master, help me!" cried the father. And he named the name of Rabbi
Israel.

Then the boy tripped over the root of an old tree. Before he could rise
to his feet again, his father was at his side.

"Come home with me," said the father.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

He led the boy to the house, and placed him in a room, and locked the
door.

It became very hot. The boy cried, and beat on the door. "Let me go to
the lake!" he screamed. "I want to go to the lake!"

But they would not open the door.

At last he begged them only to let him out of that room, because it was
so very hot in there. But they would not let him out of the room. After
that, he begged them to give him a pan of water with which to cool his
body, but Reb Shmerl was afraid to give him even a glass of water to
drink.

And after several hours the boy became worn out, and weak, and fell to
the floor and slept.

 

Many people went to bathe themselves in the sea that morning. As the sun
rose higher, the lake became filled with swimmers. They laughed, and
sported in the cool water.

When the sun reached the middle of the sky, and blazed angrily down on
the earth, then nearly every soul in old Constantine was bathing in the
lake.

At exactly the hottest moment of noon a disturbance began in the water.
Ripples grew in circles around a certain spot near the shore, as though
a stone had been thrown into the water there. The ripples widened, and
became a sworl. And out of the midst of the sworl, a hand appeared,
reaching up from the water. Then a second hand appeared. The two hands
rose upward, reaching. The full arms appeared, hairy with greenish
seaweed. And after the arms came long floating seaweed hair. A head rose
from the water, and a neck, and shoulder, and the upper part

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

of a body, all hairy with greenish seaweed. Then the head turned slowly
from one side to another, and the arms reached outward, and the eyes
looked into the faces of all the bathers.

The mouth moved. The voice was harsh and deep.

"One is missing!" it shouted angrily.

And the head sank back into the sea.

 

When the sun had gone down, and night had come, the parents opened the
room where the boy lay worn out sleeping. They woke him, and gave him
wine to drink and dainty things to eat, and they held the feast of his
thirteenth birthday.
