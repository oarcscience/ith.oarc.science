<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">When</span> the Baal Shem Tov was near his death, a student came to him with a written book and said, "These are your words, which I have written down. This is the Torah of Rabbi Israel."</p>  
<p>The Master read what was written, and said, "Not one word of this is my Torah."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Before he died, Rabbi Israel said, "The holy men after me will be as the leaves on the trees. The Tsadikim will be as numerous as poppyseeds, and as great."</p>
