# PREFACE.

This metaphysical essay, called "Sepher Yezirah," (book on creation, or
cosmogony,) which I have endeavored to render into English, with
explanatory notes, is considered by all modem literati as the first
philosophical book that ever was written in the Hebrew language. But the
time of its composition and the name of its author have not yet been
ascertained, despite of the most elaborate researches of renowned
archaeologists. Some maintain that this essay is mentioned in the Talmud
treatise Sanhedrin, p. 66 b. and ibid. 67 b. which passage is according
to the commentary of Rashi, to treatise Erubin, p. 63 a., a reliable
historical notice. Hence this book was known already in the second or at
the beginning of the third century of the Christian Era. The historian,
Dr. Graetz, tries to show very ingeniously in his work, entitled
"Gnosticism," p. 104 and 110, that it was written in the early centuries
of the Christian Church, especially when the ideas and views of the
Gnostics were in vogue. This opinion, however, he afterwards revoked.
(See Dr. Graetz's "History of the Jews," Vol. V, p. 315 in a note.)

Dr. Zunz, the Nestor of the Jewish Rabbis in Europe, maintains that we
have to look for the genesis of the book "Yezirah" in the Geonic period,
(700-1000), and that it was consequently composed in a post-talmudical
time. But if so, it is very strange

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

that Saadjah Gaon, who lived in the tenth, and Judah Halevi, who lived
in the twelfth century, represented the book "Yezirah" as a very ancient
work. Therefore it seems to me, that Dr. Graetz had no sufficient cause
to repudiate his assertion concerning the age of this book; because all
the difficulties which he himself and others raised against his
supposition, fall to the ground, when we consider that the most ancient
works, holy as well as profane, had one and the same fate, namely, that
from age to age more or less interpolations were made by copyists and
commentators. Compare also Prof. Tenneman's "Grundriss der Geschichte
der Philosophie," improved by Prof. Wendt, p. 207.

 

Tradition, which ascribes the authorship of this book to the patriarch
Abraham, is fabulous, as can be proved by many reasons; but the idea
that Rabbi Akiba, who lived about the beginning of the second century,
composed the book "Yezirah," is very likely possible. Be this as it may,
it is worth while to know the extravagant hypotheses which ancient
Jewish philosophers and theologians framed as soon as they began to
contemplate and to reason, endeavoring to combine oriental and Greek
theories. Although there is an exuberance of weeds, we will find,
nevertheless, many germs of truisms, which are of the greatest
importance. A Christian theologian, Johann Friedrich von Meyer D. D.,
remarked very truly in his German preface to the book "Yezirah,"
published in Leipzig, 1830: "This book is for two reasons highly
important: in the first place, that the real Cabala, or mystical

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

doctrine of the Jews, which must be carefully distinguished from its
excrescences, is in close connection and perfect accord with the Old and
New Testaments; and in the second place, that the knowledge of it is of
great importance to the philosophical inquirers, and can not be put
aside. Like a cloud permeated by beams of light which makes one infer
that there is more light behind it, so do the contents of this book,
enveloped in obscurity, abound in coruscations of thought, reveal to the
mind that there is a still more effulgent light lurking somewhere, and
thus inviting us to a further contemplation and investigation, and at
the same time demonstrating the danger of a superficial investigation,
which is so prevalent in modem times, rejecting that which can not be
understood at first sight."

 

I shall now try to give a sketch of the system as it is displayed in the
book "Yezirah," which forms a link in the chain of the ancient
theoretical speculations of philosophers, who were striving to ascertain
the truth mainly by reasoning a-priori, and who imagined that it is thus
possible to permeate all the secrets of nature. It teaches that a first
cause, eternal, all-wise, almighty and holy, is the origin and the
centre of the whole universe, from whom gradually all beings emanated.
Thought, speech and action are an inseparable unity in the divine being;
God made or created, is metaphorically expressed by the word: writing.
The Hebrew language and its characters correspond mostly with the things
they designate, and thus holy thoughts, Hebrew language

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

and its reduction to writing, form a unity which produce a creative
effect. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

The self-existing first cause called the creation into existence by
quantity and quality; the former represented by ten numbers,
(Sephiroth,) the latter by twenty-two letters, which form together
thirty-two ways of the divine wisdom. Three of the twenty-two letters,
namely, Aleph, Mem, Sheen, are the mothers, or the first elements, from
which came forth the primitive matter of the world: air, water and fire,
that have their parallel in man, (male and female): breast, body and
head, and in the year: moisture, cold and heat. The other seven double
and twelve <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) simple letters are then
represented as stamina, from which other spheres or media of existence
emanated.

Man is a microcosm, as the neck separates rationality from vitality, so
does diaphragm the vitality from the vegetativeness.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> God stands in
close connection with the Universe, and just so is Tali connected with
the world, that is, an invisible, celestial or universal axis carries
the whole fabric. In the year by the sphere, in man by the heart, and
thus is the ruling spirit of God everywhere. Notwithstanding the decay
of the individual, the genus is produced by the antithesis of man and
wife.

 

Hebrew commentaries on the book "Yezirah" were composed by: first,
Saadjah Gaon, of Fajum in Egypt, (892-942); second, Rabbi Abraham ben
Dior Halevi; third, Rabbi Moses ben Nachman; fourth, Elieser of Germisa;
fifth, Moses Botarel; sixth, Rabbi Eliah Wilna: The book "Yezirah,"
together with all these commentaries, was published in 1860, in the city
of Lemberg. But although the commentator Saadjah was a sober minded
scholar in a superstitious age, a good Hebrew grammarian, a renowned
theologian and a good translator of the Hebrew Pentateuch, Isaiah and
Job into the Arabian language, his ideas and views were, nevertheless,
very often much benighted. See his comments on Yez. Chap. I, etc., etc.;
his notes on "Yezirah" Chap. III, 2, prove undoubtedly that he had no
knowledge whatever of natural science, and therefore his annotations on
the book "Yezirah" are of little or no use at all. All the other
commentaries mentioned above, together with all quotations of other
expounders of the same book, contain nothing but a medley of arbitrary,
mystical explanations and sophistical distortions of scriptural verses,
astrological notions, oriental

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

superstitions, a metaphysical jargon, a poor knowledge of physics and
not a correct elucidation of the ancient book; they drew mostly from
their own imagination, and credited the author of "Yezirah" with saying
very strange things which he never thought of. I must not omit to
mention two other Hebrew commentaries, one by Judah Halevi, and the
other by Ebn Ezra, who lived in the first part of the twelfth century.
They succeeded in explaining the book "Yezirah" in a sound scientific
manner, but failed in making themselves generally understood, on account
of the superstitious age in which they lived, and the tenacity with
which the people in that period adhered to the marvelous and
supernatural; they found, therefore, but few followers, and the 'book
"Yezirah" remained to the public an enigma and an ancient curiosity,
giving rise to a system of metaphysical delirium, called Cabala.

 

Translations of the book "Yezirah" and comments thereon by learned
Christian authors are: first, a translation of the book "Yezirah" with
explanatory notes in the Latin language, by Wilhelm Postellus, Paris,
France, 1552; second, another Latin version is contained in Jo. Pistorii
artis cabalistical scriptorum, Tom I, p. 869, sqq., differing from that
of Postellus. Some are of the opinion that John Reuchlin, while others
maintain that Paul Riccius was the author of it. (See Wolfii Biblioth.
Hebr. Tom., I, Chap. 1.) Third, Rittangel published the book "Yezirah,"
1642, at Amsterdam, entitled: "Liber Yezirah qui Abrahamo patriarchae
adscribitur, una cum commentario

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rabbi Abraham F.
D. (filii Dior) super 32 Semitis Sapientiae, a quibus liber Yezirah
incipit. Translatus et notis illustrates, a Joanne Stephano Rittangelio,
ling. Orient. in Elect. Acad. Regiomontana Prof. extraord. Amstelodami
ap. Jo. and Jodoc. Janssonios," 1642, in quarto; fourth, Johann
Friedrich von Mayer, D. D., published the book "Yezirah" in Hebrew with
a translation and explanatory notes in the German language, Leipzig,
1830.

All these translations are out of print and are rarely found even in
well regulated libraries. I was so fortunate as to obtain a copy of Dr.
Mayer's edition of the book "Yezirah." He states in the preface to it,
that he had a copy of Postellus' translation in manuscript as well as
some others, and compared them. The explanatory notes given by this
author are, nevertheless, insufficient and sometimes very incorrect. The
present translation is, as far as I could ascertain, the first that was
ever published in the English language. Again, I have to add that I have
not only endeavored to correct a great many mistakes and erroneous ideas
of my predecessors, but I have also endeavored to give more complete
annotations. I therefore hope that the candid reader will consider the
great difficulties I had to overcome in this still unbeaten way of the
ancient Jewish spiritual region, and will receive with indulgence this
new contribution to archaeological knowledge.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[7:1](sy01.htm#fr_0.md) Thus for instance, they
imagined that the name of Jehovah, ‏יהוי‎, is by reversing the alphabet;
‏מצפץ‎ (mzpz); mem signifies the letter jod, zaddi, the letter he, and
pe, the letter wav. These unmeaning sounds, they said, have magic power.
Some maintained that the Hebrew language consists of twenty-two
consonants, because being the complex of all beings, its number is equal
to the most perfect figure, namely, of the periphery, as it is well
known that the diameter is always to the periphery as seven to
twenty-two.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[7:2](sy01.htm#fr_1.md) It was frequently observed
by Jewish and Christian theologians, that the Marcosianio Gnostic
system, as well as that of the Clementinians of the second century,
contain many analogies and parallels with the book "Yezirah." Marcus
divides the Greek alphabet into three parts, namely: nine mute
consonants ἀφωνα, eight half vowels ἡμιφωνα, and seven vowels φωνηεντα,
in order to give a clear idea of the peculiar constitution of his
"Aeons." (Irenaeus Haer, I, 16.)
