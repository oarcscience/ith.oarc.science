The Sepher Yezirah is the central text of the Kabbalah, in which the
doctrine of the 'mother letters' is expounded, and the associations
between the other letters and the 'tree of life' are exposited.

PRODUCTION NOTES: This etext includes the Hebrew text and all of
Kalisch's apparatus. The Hebrew text, which in the original book is on
the (odd numbered) facing page, has been collated with the English
translation; this is why there are only even numbered page numbers in
the body of the etext. Viewing the Hebrew text requires that your
browser be set up correctly to view Unicode: for more information,
please refer to [the Unicode instruction page](../../unicode.md). In
particular, please follow the instructions on that page before firing
off an email to me that the file is defective: it isn't, if you can't
see the Hebrew text, *the problem is your browser*.

The pointed Hebrew text was entered by hand using a transliteration
scheme. Each Hebrew letter was checked at least twice. This was a very
laborious process, and it is inevitable that there are still errors in
the Hebrew text, which I'll be happy to correct if they can be
identified. Some of these may be due to substandard typography in the
original, particularly the Hebrew in body text.
