# TRACT SANHEDRIN (SUPREME COUNCIL).

## CHAPTER I.

RULES AND REGULATIONS CONCERNING THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES IN CIVIL AND
CRIMINAL CASES. WHICH ARE CONSIDERED CIVIL AND WHICH CRIMINAL. HOW MANY
ARE NEEDED TO THE INTERCALATION OF A YEAR AND OF MONTHS; TO APPRAISE
CONSECRATED REAL ESTATE AS WELL AS MOVABLE PROPERTIES; AND IF AMONG THE
APPRAISERS MUST BE PRIESTS, AND IF SO HOW MANY. THE NUMBER OF PERSONS
NEEDED TO ADD TO THE CITY FROM THE SUBURBS OF JERUSALEM. WHAT MAJORITY
IS NEEDED TO ACCUSE AND WHAT TO ACQUIT. HOW MANY PEOPLE MUST BE IN A
CITY THAT A COURT OF TWENTY-THREE JUDGES SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED.

MISHNA *I*: To decide upon the following cases, three persons are needed
(the Gemara explains for which common and for which judges): Civil
cases, robbery, wounds, whole damages and half, double amount and four
and five fold payments; <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) and the same
in the case of forcing, seducing, and libel (*i.e.*, an evil name, Deut.
xxii. 19). So is the decree of R. Meir.

The sages, however, maintain: In the last case (libel) twenty-three are
needed, as this is not a civil case, but a crime which may bring capital
punishment. In the case of stripes, three. In the name of R. Ishmael,
however, it was said: Twenty-three are needed. To the intercalation of a
month and to proclaim a leap year, three. So is the decree of R. Meir.

Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel maintains: It begins with three persons and is
discussed by five, and the decision is rendered by seven If, however, it
was decided by three, their decision holds good.

The elders who had to lay their hands upon sacrifices \[Lev.

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

iv\. 15\], and also in the case of the heifer \[Deut. xxi.
3\]--according to R. Simeon, three are needed, and according to R.
Jehudah, five. At the performance of the ceremony of Halitzah and
denial, three; to appraise the value of the plants of the fourth year
(which must be redeemed), and the second tithe, of which the value in
money is to be appraised, three; to appraise the value of consecrated
articles, three; in cases of Arakhin (vows of value, men or articles),
if movable property, three--according to R. Jehudah, one of them must be
a priest; and if real estate, ten, and one of them a priest; and
likewise to appraise the estimated value of men \[Lev. xxvii.\].

Crimes (which may bring capital punishment), twenty-three; in the case
of Lev. xx. 15, twenty-three, as verse 16 reads: "Then shalt thou kill
the woman and the beast"; and also in the preceding verse: "The beast
also shall ye slay." And the same is the case with the stoning of an ox,
of which it reads \[Ex. xxi. 29\]: "The ox shall be stoned, and the
owner . . . be put to death"--which means, as for the death of its owner
twenty-three are needed, so also for the stoning of the ox.

The wolf, the lion, the bear, the tiger, the bardls, <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) and the serpent are killed by the judgment
of twenty-three. R. Eliezer, however, maintains: Every one who hastens
to kill them is rewarded. But R. Aqiba says: Twenty-three are needed.

A whole tribe, or a false prophet, or a high-priest, if they have to be
judged for a crime which may bring capital punishment, a court of
seventy-one judges is needed. The same number of judges is needed to
decide upon battles which are not commanded by the Scriptures, and also
for enlarging the city of Jerusalem by annexing its suburbs or free
land; and the same is the case if it is necessary to enlarge the
courtyard of the Temple. Also, the same number of judges is needed for
appointing supreme councils to each tribe. A misled town \[Deut. xii.
14\] must also be condemned by seventy-one. However, a town which stands
on the boundary cannot be condemned; nor three of them at one time at
any place, but only one, or two.

The Great (Sanhedrin) consisted of seventy-one, and the small of
twenty-three. Whence do we deduce that the great council must be of
seventy-one? From \[Num. xi. 16\]: "Gather unto me seventy men." And add
Moses, who was the head of them--hence seventy-one? And whence do we
deduce that a small one, must be twenty-three? From \[ibid. xxxv. 24 and
25\]: "The

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

congregation shall judge"; "And the congregation shall save." <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) We see that one congregation judges, and the
other congregation saves-hence there are twenty; as a congregation
consists of no less than ten persons, and this is deduced from \[ibid.
xiv. 27\], "To this evil congregation," which was of the ten spies,
except Joshua and Caleb. And whence do we deduce that three more are
needed? From \[Ex. xxiii. 2\]: Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do
evil"--from which we infer that you shall follow them to do good. But if
so, why is it written at the end of the same verse, "Incline after the
majority, to wrest judgment"? <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md) This
means, the inclination to free the man must not be similar to the
inclination to condemn; as to condemn a majority of two is needed, while
to free, the majority of one suffices. And a court must not consist of
an even number, as, if their opinion is halved, no verdict can be
established; therefore one more must be added. Hence it is of
twenty-three.

How many shall a city contain that it shall be fit for a supreme
council? One hundred and twenty families. R. Nehemiah, however,
maintains: Two hundred and thirty--so that each of them should be the
head of ten families, as we do not find in the Bible rulers of less than
ten.

GEMARA: Are not robbery and wounds civil cases? Said R. Abuhu: The
Mishna means to explain the term "civil cases" by robbery and wounds;
but to the admitting of debts or loans, three judges are not needed. And
that so it should be understood, both expressions were needed; as, if it
stated civil cases only, it would include loans, etc.; and if the
expression "robbery," etc., only, one might also say the same is the
case with loans, etc.; and the expression "robbery," etc., is because
the main point wherein three judges are prescribed by the Scriptures is
in cases of robbery \[Ex. xxii. 7\]: "Shall the master of the house be
brought unto the judges." And concerning wounds, it is the same whether
a wound be in one's body or in his pocket (money), and therefore it
begins with civil cases, and explains that cases like robbery are meant,
and not common ones, etc. But whence are common loans excluded, that
they do not need three? Did not R. Abuhu say: If two persons have judged
in a matter of civil law, all agree that their

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

judgment is of no value? Therefore we must say that the Mishna means to
exclude loans and admission of debts--to exclude from three
*established* judges; but three common men are needed. And the reason is
what R. Hanina said: Biblically, investigation is needed of crimes as
well as of civil cases. As it is written \[Lev. xxiv. 22\]: "One manner
of judicial law shall ye have." But why was it said that civil cases do
not need investigation? In order not to lock the door to borrowers. And
Rabha explained this statement as meaning that in two kinds of civil
cases--loans, etc.--three common people are needed; but in cases of
robbery, etc., three established judges. And R. Aha b. R. Ekha said:
Biblically, even one is fit to decide civil cases, as it is written
\[ibid. xix. 15\]: "In righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor." But
the rabbis enacted three, in order to prevent men of the market, who are
ignorant of law, to undertake to judge cases. But is it not the same
with three common men? Are they not men of the market? If three
undertake to judge a case, it is highly probable that at least one of
them knows something of law. But if so, let two who should make an error
in judging not be responsible? If this should be enacted, then all the
market people would undertake to decide upon things.

But what is the difference between Rabha and R. Aha b. R. Ekha
(according to both, three common men are needed in cases of common
loans, etc.)? They differ in the following, which was said by Samuel: If
two commoners have decided upon loan cases, their decision is to be
respected; but they are considered an impertinent Beth Din. Rabha does
not hold with Samuel, and maintains: Their decision must not be
respected. And R Aha holds with him (Samuel).

"*Whole damages and half*," etc. Are not damages the same as wounds
(both are to be paid)? Because it has to state half damages, it mentions
also whole damages. Are not half damages also the same? The Mishna
teaches concerning money which is to be collected according to the
strict law and that which is only a fine. But this is correct only as to
him who says that half damages are a fine; but as to him who says
damages are strict law, what can be said? Because it has to state about
the double amount, and four and five fold, which are more than the
amount damaged, it mentions also half damages, which is less; and as
half is mentioned, it mentions also the whole.

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

Whence do we deduce that three are needed? From what the rabbis taught.
It treats \[Ex. xxii. 7 and 8\] three times of judges; hence three are
needed. So said R. Yachiha. R. Jonathan, however, maintains: The first
expression "judges," as the beginning, must not be taken into
consideration, as it is needed for itself, and therefore only the two
expressions "judges," mentioned after, are to be counted, and the third
one is added only because we do not establish a court of an even number
(as said above).

The rabbis taught: Civil cases are to be discussed by three. Rabbi,
however, said: It is discussed by five, so that the final decision
should be by three. But even when there are three, is not the final
decision made by two? He means to say, because the conclusion must be of
three judges. This explanation was ridiculed by R. Abuhu, saying: On
such a theory, then the great Supreme Council ought to be one hundred
and forty-one, to the end that the final conclusion should be made by
seventy-one; and of a small council there ought to be forty-five, so
that the conclusion should be made by twenty-three. And therefore we
must say, as the Scripture reads, "Gather unto me seventy," it means the
seventy ought to be at the time established. And the same is it in the
case above cited, "the congregation shall judge, and the congregation
shall save," meaning that at the time of judging there shall be ten. And
in the same way are to be interpreted the just cited verses 7 and 8,
that the plaintiff has to bring his case before three only. Therefore it
may be said that the reason of Rabbi's decision is that because in the
first verse is written, "The judges may condemn," as in the last, three
is meant, so is it with the word Elohim, mentioned before, which means
judges, also two is meant, which makes four; and one is added, so that
they shall not be an even number--hence five. The rabbis do not care for
this, as the term which is translated, "They may condemn," is written in
the singular, and is only read in the plural.

The rabbis taught: Civil cases are decided by three; but if one is known
to the majority of the people as an expert, he alone may decide. Said R.
Na'hman: *e.g.*, I decide cases alone, without consulting any other
rabbis. And so also said R. Hyya.

The schoolmen propounded a question: What does R. Na'hman mean by
saying: As, for instance, I? Does he mean similar to him, who knew the
laws traditionally and by common sense, and was also so empowered by the
Exilarch; but if there

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

was one who was equal to him in wisdom, but had no permission, his
decision must not be respected? Or does he mean to say, if one were
equal to him in wisdom he might so do without permission? Come and hear:
Mar Zutra, the son of R. Na'hman, made an error in one of his decisions,
and came to question R. Joseph whether he must make good the error. To
which he answered: If he was appointed by the parties as a judge, he had
not to pay; if not, he must pay. Infer from this that he who is
appointed by the parties may so do even without permission from a higher
court.

Said Rabh: If one wants to decide cases, and not be responsible in case
of an error, he shall get permission from the Exilarch. And so also said
Samuel.

It is certain that here in Babylon a permission from the Exilarch holds
good for the whole country; and the same is the case from the Prince in
Palestine, for the whole of Palestine and Syria. And it is also certain
that if one has a permission from the Exilarch, he may practise in
Palestine. As the following Boraitha states: The sceptre shall not
depart from Judah. These are the exilarchs of Babylon, who rule over
Israel with their sceptres. "And a lawgiver," etc., \[Gen. xlix, 10\]
means the grandsons of Hillel, who are teaching the Torah among the
majority of the people. The question, however, is, if with the
permission of the princes they may judge in Babylon?

Come and hear: Rabba b. Hana had decided a case and erred, and came to
question R. Hyya whether he had to pay, To which he answered: If the
parties appointed you as a judge, you have nothing to pay; but if not,
you have. Now, as Rabba, b. Hana had permission from Palestine, and
would be obliged to pay if not appointed, it is to be inferred that the
permission from Palestine did not hold good in Babylon. But is it not a
fact that Rabba b. R. Huna, when he would quarrel with the house of the
Exilarch, used to say: I did not take any permission from you, but from
my father, who had it from Rabh, and the latter from R. Hyya, and the
latter from Rabbi? This was concerning worldly affairs only. But if the
permission of Palestine does not hold good for Babylon, why did Rabba b.
Hana take it? For the cities which are situated on the boundary of
Palestine. How was the case when he took the permission? When he was
about to descend from Palestine to Babylon, R. Hyya said to Rabbi: My
brother's son, Rabba b. Hana, descends to Babylon. And Rabbi answered:
He may teach the

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

law, decide civil cases, and may also decide upon the blemishes of
first-born animals which are prohibited to be slaughtered without a
blemish on their body. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)

When Rabh was about to go to Babylon, R. Hyya said to Rabbi: The son of
my sister goes to Babylon. Said Rabbi: He may teach the law, decide
cases, but not about blemishes of the first-born of animals.

Why did R. Hyya name the first "my brother's son" and the second "my
sister's son"? And lest one say that so was the case, did not the master
say: Abu, Hana, Shila, Marta, and R. Hyya all were the sons of Abba b.
Aha Kharsala of Khaphri? (Hence Rabh, who was Abu's son, was also his
brother's son--why did he say "my sister's"?)

Rabh, who was his brother's and also his sister's son (on his mother's
side), he named him "the son of my sister"; but Rabba b. Hana was the
son of his brother only. And if you wish, it may be said that R. Hyya
named him "my sister's," because of his great wisdom. As it is written
\[Prov. vii. 4\]: "Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister." But why should
Rabh not be permitted to decide about blemishes? Was he not wise enough
for this? Is it not a fact that be was wiser than any of his
contemporaries? Or was he not acquainted enough with the kind of
blemishes? Did not Rabh say: I have dwelt eighteen months with a
pasturer of cattle to learn the blemishes which are temporary, and those
which remain forever? This was done that Rabba b. Hana should be
respected, as Rabh was highly respected even without that. And if you
wish, it might be said that because of the fact itself, that Rabh was an
expert concerning blemishes, it was not allowed to him to practise, for
the reason that Rabh would allow such blemishes as other experts were
not aware of, and people who should see that would act likewise, relying
upon Rabh, so that they would finally allow the animal which had a
temporary blemish to be slaughtered.

It is said above: "Rabbi said: He shall teach law." To what purpose was
this said? Does such a scholar as Rabh need such a permission for
teaching? This was said because of the

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

following case: It happened that Rabbi went into a certain place and saw
that they kneaded dough without offering a sample for legal purity. And
to the question why they did so, their answer was: There was a disciple
who taught: Water of *Bzein* (swamp) does not make articles subject to
defilement. In reality, however, the expression was: "Mee Beizim," which
means eggs; and they took it for Bzein, and acted accordingly. And
therefore it was taught: A decree was enacted that a disciple should not
teach unless he had the permission of his master.

Tanchun, the son of R. Ami, happened to be in the city of Hthar, and
lectured: One may wet wheat and pound for peeling on Passover. And they
said to him: Is not there here R. Mani of the city of Zur, who is a
great scholar, and there is a Boraitha: A disciple must not decide a
Halakha at the place of his master, unless distant from him three
parsas--which distance Israel took when travelling in the desert. And he
answered: I was not aware of this.

R. Hyya saw a man standing in a cemetery, and said to him: Are you not
the son of so and so, who was a priest? He said: Yea, but my father was
one of those who follow their eyes. He saw a divorced woman and married
her, and with this he annulled the priesthood.

It is certain, when one takes a permission to give judgment, in part,
that it holds good (as so it was with Rabh). But how is it if the
permission was conditionally for a certain time? Come and hear what R.
Johanan said to R. Shauman: You have our permission until you shall
return to us.

The text says: Samuel said: If it was decided by two, their, decision is
valid; but they are called an impertinent Beth Din. R. Na'hman repeated
this Halakha, and Rabha objected from the following. If two are
defending and two are accusing, and one says, "I do not know how to
decide," judges must be added; now, if it were as you say, that the
decision of two is valid, let, then, the decision of the two hold good?
There it is different, as they start with the intention that it should
be decided by three. He then objected to him from the following: Rabban
Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Judgment in accordance with the strict law must
be decided by three. In an arbitration, however, two suffice; and the
strength of the mediation is greater than that of the law; as, if there
were two who had decided a case in accordance with the law, although
they were appointed by the parties, they (the parties) may retract. But

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

if a mediation was made by the arbitrators, no retraction can take
place. And lest one say that the rabbis differ with R. Simeon, did not
R. Abuhu say: All agree that a decision passed by two is valueless? And
he answered: Do you oppose one man to another (Abuhu may say so, and
Samuel otherwise)?

R. Abba objected to R. Abuhu from the following: If one has decided upon
a case--freed the guilty, or pronounced guilty the innocent, or decided
unclean a thing which is clean, or *vice versa*, the act is valid and he
must pay from his pocket. (Hence we see that even the decision of one is
respected.) This Boraitha speaks of when the parties had appointed him
for this purpose. But if so, why must he pay? It means, if they tell
him: We appoint you to decide this case in accordance with the biblical
law.

Said R. Safras to R. Abba: Let us see what was the error. If the error
was that he decided against a Mishna, did not R. Shesheth say in the
name of R. Assi that he who made an error as to a Mishna might retract
from his decision? Hence such a decision is not valid, and he has not to
pay from his pocket. Therefore it must be said that it means he erred in
his opinion. How is this to be understood? Said R. Papa: *E.g.*, there
were two Tanaim and two Amoraim who differed in a case, and it was not
decided with whom the Halakha prevailed. However, the world practised
according to one party, and he had decided the case according to the
other party; and this could be called erring in one's opinion.

Shall we assume that in that case in which Samuel and R. Abuhu differ,
the Tanaim of the following Boraitha also differ: Arbitrating must be
done by three persons. So is the decree of R. Meir. The sages, however,
maintain: One is sufficient? The schoolmen who heard this thought that
all agree that arbitration is similar to a strict law, and therefore
they assumed that the point of their difference was: R. Meir holds three
are needed, and the sages that two suffice. Nay, all agree that a strict
law must be decided by three, and the point of their differing is:
Whether arbitration must be similar to a strict law according to one it
must, and according to the other it must not.

Shall we assume that there are three Tanaim who differ concerning
arbitration? One holds: Three are needed; the second, two; and the
third, that even one is sufficient. Said R. Aha b. R. Ekha, according to
others R. Yema b. Chlamia: He says two are needed holds that even one is
sufficient; and only

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

to the end that they should be able to testify to this case as witnesses
did he say two. Said R. Ashi: Infer from this that an arbitration does
not need a sudarium; for if it should be necessary, why should not the
one who maintains that three are needed be satisfied with two and a
sudarium? The Halakha, however, prevails: An arbitration needs a
sudarium.

The rabbis taught: Even as a strict law needs three, so is it with
arbitration. However, when the decision is already given in accordance
with the strict law, an arbitration cannot take place. R. Eliezer, the
son of R. Jose the Galilean, used to say: It is prohibited to mediate,
and he who should do so sins; and he who praises the mediators despises
the law, as it is written \[Ps. x. 3\]: "The robber blesseth himself
when he hath despised the Lord." But it may be taken as a rule that the
strict law shall bore the mountain, as it is written \[Deut. i. 17\]:
"The judgment belongs to God." And so was it said by Moses our master.
But Aaron (his brother) loved peace, ran after it, and used to make
peace among the people, as it is written \[Mal. ii. 6\]: "The law of
truth was in his mouth, and falsehood was not found on his lips; in
peace and equity he walked with me, and many did he turn away from
iniquity." And R. Jehoshua b. Karha also said: Arbitration is a
meritorious act, as it is written \[Zech. viii. 16\]: "With truth and
the judgment of peace, judge ye in your gates." How is this to be
understood? Usually, when there is judgment, there is no peace; and
*vice versa*. It must then be said that an arbitration is a judgment
which makes peace. So also was it said about David \[II Sam. viii. 16\]:
"And David did what was just and charitable <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) unto all his people."

Here, also, "just" and "charitable" do not correspond; as if just, it
could not be called charitable, and *vice versa*. Say, then, it means
arbitration, which contains both.

The first Tana, however, who said above that arbitration is prohibited,
explains the passage thus: He, David, judged in accordance with the
strict law--he acquitted him who was right, and made responsible him who
was so, according to the law, but when he saw that the culpable one was
poor and could not pay, he used to pay from his pocket. Hence he did
judgment to one and charity to the other. Rabbi, however, could not
agree with such an explanation, because of the expression,

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

unto all his people"; and according to the above explanation, it ought
to be "to the poor." Therefore said he: Although he did not pay from his
pocket, it was counted as a charitable act that he delivered a theft out
of the hands of the defendant.

R. Simeon b. Menasia said: If two persons brought a case before you,
before you have heard their claims, and even thereafter, but you are
still not aware to whom the strict law inclines, you may say to them: Go
and mediate among yourselves. But after you are aware who is right
according to the strict law, you must not advise them to mediate, as it
is written \[Prov. xvii. 14\]: "As one letteth loose (a stream) of
water, so is the beginning of strife; therefore before it be enkindled,
leave off the contest"; which means, before it be enkindled you may
advise a mediation, but not after you know with whom the law is. Similar
to this is: If two persons came with a case before you, one being mighty
(who can harm you) and the other common, you may say to them, "I am not
fit to judge between you," so long as you have not heard their claims;
or even thereafter, not knowing as yet to whom the law inclines. But you
must not say so after you are aware; as it is written \[Deut. i. 17\]:
"Ye shall not be afraid of any man."

R. Jehoshua b. Karha said: Whence do we deduce that if a disciple were
present when a case came before his master, and saw a defence for the
poor and an accusation for the rich (which his master might overlook),
he must not keep silence? From the verse just cited. R. Hanin said: One
must not keep in his words out of respect for any one; and witnesses
also must be aware for whom they testify, and for whom their testimony
goes. And who is he who will punish them for bearing false witness? As
it is written \[Deut. xix. 17\]: "Then shall both the men who have the
controversy stand before the Lord." And the judge must also be aware of
same, as it is written \[Ps. lxxxii. i\]: "God standeth in the
congregation of God; in the midst of judges doth he judge." And so also
it reads \[II. Chron. xix. 6\], which was said by the king Jehoshaphat:
"Look (well) at what ye are doing; because not for man are ye to judge,
but for the Lord."

And should the judge say: Why should I take the trouble and the
responsibility to myself?--therefore it is written at the end of this
verse: "Who is with you in pronouncing judgment." Hence the judge has to
decide according to what he sees with his eyes.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

What is to be understood by final judgment? Said R. Jehudah in the name
of Rabh: When the judge is able to pronounce: You, so and so, are
guilty, and you, so and so, are right. Said Rabh: The Halakha prevails
with R. Jehoshua b. Karha. Is that so? Was not R. Huna a disciple of
Rabh, and his custom was, to question the parties of a case before him:
Do you desire strict law, or arbitration? Hence we see that he did not
begin with mediation; and R. Jehoshua said that mediation is a
meritorious act. R. Jehoshua, with his statement, means also to say: Ask
the parties which they like better. But if so, it is the same as what
the first Tana said (*i.e.*, it is prohibited to arbitrate after the
conclusion, but not before the case is begun)? The difference between
them is--according to R. Jehoshua it is a meritorious act; and according
to the first Tana it is only a permission for the judge, but not
meritorious. But then it is the same as R. Simeon b. Menasia said. There
is also a difference, as according to the latter we must not advise an
arbitration after hearing the claim, which is not according to the
former. All the Tanaim mentioned above differ with R. Thn'hum b. Hnilai,
who said: The above-cited verse \[Ps. x.\] was said concerning the
golden calf \[Ex. xxxii. 5\]: "And when Aaron saw this." What did he
see? Said R. Benjamin b. Jeptheth in the name of R. Elazar: He saw Chur,
who was killed by the people. And he thought: "If I do not listen to
them, they will do likewise with me, and will commit a sin, as written
\[Lam. ii. 20\]: 'Shall there be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord the
priest and the prophet?' And they will have no remedy. It is better for
them that I should make the golden calf, and to that probably there will
be a remedy by repenting."

There was one who used to say: It is well for him who is silent while
being reproved; and if he is accustomed to do so, it prevents a hundred
evil things which he might have to overcome through quarrelling. Said R.
Samuel to R. Jehudah: This man only repeats what is already written in
the above-cited verse \[Prov. xvii. 141\]. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) There was another who used to say: A thief
is not killed for stealing two or three times (*i.e.*, do not wonder if
the punishment does not occur at once, as finally it will come). And
Samuel said to R. Jehudah: This is also repeating the verse \[Amos, ii.
5\]: "Thus hath said the

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lord, For three
transgressions of Israel, and for four, will I not turn away their
punishment."

There was another who used to say: Into seven pits does the man of peace
fall and come out, and the wicked does not come out from the first into
which he falls. And to this also said Samuel to R. Jehudah: It is a
repetition of the verse, Prov. xxiv. 16: "For though the righteous were
to fall seven times, he will rise up again"; and should the wicked fall
in one, <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) he will not rise again.

There was another who used to say: If the court levied on one's mantle
for a bet to his neighbor, he might chant a song and go on his way. And
to this the same said to the same: This also is to be understood from
\[Ex. xviii. 23\]: "The whole of this people will come to its place in
peace."

There was another who used to say: She slumbers, and the basket which
was placed on her head fell down. And also to this said Samuel: The same
is understood of \[Eccl. x. 18\]: "Through slothful hands the rafters
will sink," etc. And there was another who used to say: The man on whom
I relied raises his fist against me. To which Samuel referred \[Ps. xli.
10\]: "Yea, even the man that should have sought my welfare, in whom I
trusted, who eateth my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me."

There was one more who used to say: When love was strong, we--I and my
wife--could place ourselves on the flat of a sword. Now, when love is
gone, a bed of sixty ells is not sufficient for us. To which R. Huna
said: We can see this from the Scriptures in \[Ex. xxv. 22\]: "I will
speak with thee from above the cover." And a Boraitha. states that the
ark measured nine spans, and the cover one; hence, altogether, it
measured ten. Also in \[I Kings vi. 2\]: ". . . house which was built .
. . sixty cubits in length." And finally we read \[Is. lxvi. 1\]: ". . .
where is there a house that ye can build unto me?" (*I.e.*, when the
Tabernacle was built, ten spans sufficed, and at the exile no house in
the world could be found in which the Shekinah would rest.)

R. Samuel b. Na'hmani in the name of Jonathan said: A judge who judges
truth to his fellow-men makes the Shekinah to rest in Israel; as the
above-cited Psalm lxxxii. I reads: "God

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

standeth in the congregation of God; in the midst of judges doth he
judge." And those who do the contrary influence the Shekinah to leave,
as it is written \[ibid. xii. 6\]: "Because of the oppression of the
poor, because of the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the
Lord."

The same said again in the name of the same authority: A judge who takes
away from one and gives to another, against the law, the Holy One,
blessed be He, (in revenge) will take souls from his house. Thus it is
read \[Prov. xxii. 22, 23\]: "Rob not the poor because he is poor,
neither crush the afflicted in the gate; for the Lord will plead their
cause, and despoil the life of those that despoil them."

And he said again, in the name of the same authority: A judge should
always consider as if a sword lay between his shoulders and Gehenna was
open under him. As it is written \[Solomon's Song, iii. 7, 8\]: "Behold,
it is the bed which is Solomon's; sixty valiant men are round about it,
of the valiant ones of Israel. All of them are girded with the sword,
are expert in war; every one hath his sword upon his thigh, because of
the terror in the night--which means the terror of Gehenna, which is
equal to the night.

R. Jashyha, according to others R. Na'hman b. Itz'hak, lectured: It is
written \[Jer. xxi. 12\]: "O house of David, thus hath said the Lord:
Exercise justice on (every) morning, and deliver him that is robbed out
of the hand of the oppressor." Do, then, people judge only in the
morning, and not during the entire day? It means, if the thing which you
decide is clear to you as the morning, then do so; but if not, do not.
R. Hyya b. Abba in the name of R. Jonathan, however, said: This is
inferred from \[Prov. vii. 4\]: "Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister,"
which means, if the thing is as certain to you as that it is prohibited
for you to marry your sister, then you may say it, but not otherwise.

R. Jehoshua b. Levi said: If there are ten judges discussing about one
case, the collar lies upon the neck of all of them. But is that not
self-evident? It means even a disciple who is sitting before his master
(although the result does not depend upon him).

R. Huna used to gather ten disciples of the college when a case came
before him, saying: In case of error, let them also have sawings of the
beam. And R. Ashi, when it happened that there was the carcass of a
slaughtered animal to examine if

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

it was legal, used to gather all the slaughterers of the city, for the
above-said purpose.

When R. Dimi came from Palestine, he said: R. Na'hman b. Kohen lectured:
It is written \[ibid. xxix. 4\]: "A king will through the exercise of
justice establish (the welfare of) a land; but one that loveth gifts
overthroweth it"; meaning, if the judge is like unto a king, who needs
not the favor of any one, he is establishing the land; but if like unto
a priest who goes around the barns asking for heave-offering, he
overthroweth it. The house of the Prince had appointed a judge who was
ignorant, and it was said to Jehudah b. Na'hman, the interpreter of Resh
Lakish: Go and be his interpreter. He bent himself to hear what was said
for interpretation; but the judge said nothing. Jehudah then exclaimed:
Woe unto him that saith to the wood, "Awake!" "Rouse up!" to the dumb
stone. Shall this teach? Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver,
and no breath whatever is in its bosom \[Hab. ii. 19\]. And the Holy
One, blessed be He, will punish his appointer, as the following verse
reads: "But the Lord is in his holy temple: be silent before him, all
the earth."

Resh Lakish said: If one appoints A judge who is not fit to be such, he
is considered as if he were to plant a grove in Israel. As it is written
\[Deut. xvi. 18\]: "Judges and officers shalt thou appoint unto
thyself"; and ibid. 21 it reads: "Thou shalt not plant unto thyself a
grove-any tree." R. Ashi added: And if this were done in places where
scholars are to be found, it is considered as if one should do it at the
altar, as the cited verse continues: "near the altar of the Lord thy
God."

It is written \[Ex. XX. 23\]: "Gods of silver and gods of gold," etc. Is
it only prohibited from gods of silver, and of wood we may? Said R.
Ashi: This means the judge who is appointed by means of silver and gold.
Rabh, when he went to sit on the bench, used to say: By my own will I go
to be slain (*i.e.*, if I make an error I shall be punished for it),
without attending the needs of my house; and I enter, clear the court,
and I pray that the departing should be like the entering (as he came
without sin, so should he depart). And when he saw the crowd run after
him, he used to say: "Though his exaltation should mount up to the
heavens, and his head should reach unto the clouds, yet when he but
turneth round will he vanish for ever" \[Job, xx. 6, 71 (to quiet his
excitement).

Mar Zutra the Pious, when he was carried on the shoulders

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

of his followers on the Sabbaths before the festivals (each Sabbath
before the three festivals they used to preach festival laws), he used
to say \[Prov. xxvii. 24\]: "For property endureth not forever, nor doth
the crown remain for all generations."

Bar Kapara lectured: Whence do we deduce what the rabbis said: Be
deliberate concerning judgment? From \[Ex. xx. 23.\]: "Neither shalt
thou go up by steps upon my altar"; and the next verse is These are the
laws of justice."

R. Eliezer said: Whence do we know that the judge should not step upon
the heads of the whole people (the hearers of the lectures used to sit
on the floor during the lectures, and one who passed among them appeared
as if he were stepping on their heads)? From the same cited verse. It
treats: Thou shalt set before them the laws of justice; it ought to be:
Thou shalt teach them? Said R. Jeremiah, and according to others R. Hyya
b. Abba: It means the preparation of things belonging to judgment: the
cane, the strap, the cornet, and the sandal. As R. Huna, when he used to
go on the bench, used to say: Bring here all the things above mentioned.

It is written \[Deut. i. 16\]: "And I commanded your judges at that
time." This was a warning to the judges that they should be careful with
the cane and straps, which were in their hands to punish them who
rebelled. Farther on it is written: Hear the causes between your
brethren and judge righteously." Said R. Hanina: This is a warning to
the court that it shall not listen to the claims of one party in the
absence of the other (in civil cases); and the same warning is to one of
the parties--he shall not explain his claim in the absence of his
opponent. "You shall judge righteously" means, you shall deliberate the
case carefully, and make it just in your mind, and only thereafter you
may give your decision.

It is written: "Between a man and his brother, and his stranger." Said
R. Jehudah: It means, even between a house and its attic. (*I.e.*, if it
were an inheritance, the judge must not say: You both need
dwellings-what is the difference, if one take the house and one the
attic? But he must appraise the value of each and then give his
decision. "And his stranger" means, if you hire your house to a stranger
for a dwelling, it cannot be said: What is the difference, if I give him
an oven or a stove? But you must give him according to the conditions.
So R. Jehudah. Farther on it reads: "Ye shall not recognize (respect)
persons in judgment." According to R. Jehudah, it

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

means: You shall not recognize him if he is your friend; and according
to R. Elazar, it means: You shall not recognize him as strange to you,
if he is your enemy.

The host of Rabh had to try a case before Rabh, and when he entered he
said to Rabh: Do you remember that you are my guest? And he answered:
Yea, but why? And he said: I have a case to try. Rejoined Rabh: I am
unfit to be a judge for your case (because you reminded me that you
favored me some time ago). And he appointed R. Kahana to judge the case.
R. Kahana, however, had seen that he relied too much upon Rabh, so that
he would not listen to him. He then said to him: If you listen to my
decision, well and good; and if not, I will put Rabh out of your mind
(*i.e.*, I will put you under the ban). It reads farther on "The small
as well as the great shall ye hear." Said Resh Lakish: It means, you
shall treat a case of one peruta with the same care and mind as you
would treat a case involving a hundred manas. To what purpose was this
said? Is this not self-evident? It means, if two cases come before you,
one of a peruta and one of one hundred manas, you shall not say: It is a
small case, and I will see to it after.

"Ye shall not be afraid of any man; for the judgment belongeth to God."
Said R. Hama b. R. Hanina: The Holy One, blessed be He, said: "It is the
least for the wicked to take away money from one and give it to another
illegally"; but they are troubling me that I shall return the money to
its owner. "And I commanded you at that time." Above it reads: "I
commanded your judges." Said R. Elazar in the name of R. Simlai: This
was a warning for the congregation, that they should respect their
judges; incidentally, also, a warning to the judges that they should
bear with the congregation. To what extent? Said R. Hana, according to
others R. Sabbathi: Even \[Num. xi. 12\] "as a nursing father beareth
the sucking child."

It treats \[Deut. xxxi. 23\]: "Thou must bring this people," etc. And in
verse 7 it is written: "Thou must go with." Said R. Johanan: Moses said
to Joshua: You and the elders shall rule over them; but the Holy One,
blessed be He, said: "*Thou* shalt bring them (*i.e.*, thou alone),
because there must be one ruler to a generation, and not two or many.

There is a Boraitha: A summons must be by the consent of three judges.
And this is in accordance with Rabha, who said: If the messenger of the
court had summoned one in the

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

name of one of the three judges who are in the court, the summons is
nothing unless he state it is in the name of all the three judges,
provided it was not a court day; but on a court day he has to mention
nothing.

"*Double amount.*" R. Na'hman b. R. Hisda sent a message to R. Na'hman
b. Jacob: Let the master teach us. In cases of fine, how many persons
are needed? \[What was the question--does not the Mishna state three?
The question was, whether one judge, who is an expert, may do this, or
not?\] And the answer was: This is stated in our Mishna, in the double
amount, and four and five fold-three. And it cannot be said it means
three common men; for your grandfather said in the name of Rabh: Even
ten commoners are illegal to decide cases of fine. Hence the Mishna
means judges, of whom, nevertheless, three are needed.

"*It may bring capital punishment.*" And what is it (meanwhile his claim
is money--why should three not be sufficient)? Said Ula: The point of
their differing is, if an evil tongue is to be feared (*i.e.*, while he
comes to the court complaining about his wife, witnesses may come and
testify that she had indeed sinned; and then it is a crime of capital
punishment). According to R. Meir, the fear of such is not to be taken
into consideration; and according to the rabbis, it is. Rabha, however,
maintains: The fear of an evil tongue is not taken into consideration by
all of the parties; but the point of their difference is, if the honor
of the first should be respected or not. And it treats that twenty-three
were gathered for that case, and the husband claimed that he would bring
witnesses that his wife had sinned. But thereafter he could not bring
witnesses, and the case remained as a claim for money only, and then the
twenty departed. And he asked them to decide at least his civil claim.
According to R. Meir, this case, as a money matter, might be tried by
three; but according to the rabbis, we must respect the honor of the
judges gathered, and therefore even in the latter case all the
twenty-three have to take part.

An objection was raised from a Boraitha which states: The sages said: If
the claim was money, then three suffice; but if a crime which could
bring capital punishment, then twenty-three are needed. And this is
correct only according to Rabha's statement, viz.: If the beginning of
the claim was money, then three; and if the beginning was crime, then
twenty-three. But according to Ula's it is contradictory.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

Said Rabha: I and the lion of our society, who is R. Hyya b. Abbim, have
thus explained this: The Mishna treats of a case in which the husband
brought witnesses that his wife had sinned, and his father-in-law
brought witnesses who proved the first collusive. And his claim against
the husband was money; and therefore three sufficed. But in a case where
crime is charged, twenty-three are necessary.

Abayi, however, maintains: All agree that an evil tongue is to be
feared; and they also agree that the honor of the first must be
respected. The Mishna, however, speaks of a case in which the warning
was as to capital punishment, but not stoning. (*I.e.*, as will be
explained in the proper place, one should not be put to death for a
crime of which he was not warned that the punishment for it was death;
and according to some, the warning must be: The punishment for such a
crime is such and such a death. And as the punishment of adultery is
stoning, and she was warned only of death in general, according to him
who holds that the warning must state the kind of death, in this case no
capital punishment can occur.) And this is in accordance with R.
Jehudah, who said elsewhere: One is not put to death unless he was
informed in the warning what kind of death he should die.

R. Papa maintains: It speaks of a scholarly woman who was aware of what
kind of punishment pertained to such a thing; and the point of their
differing is, if to a scholar warning is needed. And R. Ashi maintains:
The warning was as to stripes, instead of capital punishment; and the
point of their differing is, if a trial involving stripes needs
twenty-three, in accordance with the opinion of R. Ishmael, or
not. <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) And Rabhina maintains: It speaks
of when one of the witnesses was found a relative, or incompetent to be
a witness; and the point of their difference is, if the testimony of the
other witnesses should be ignored because of the incompetent one, or not
(explained at length in Tract Maccoth). And if you wish, it can be said
that it speaks of when one was warned by some others, but not by the
witnesses; and there are some of the Tanaim who hold that the warning
holds good only when it was made by the witnesses. And it might also be
said that the witnesses contradicted one another, at the
cross-examination, concerning certain unimportant things (*e.g.*, how he
and she were dressed when the crime was committed),

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

but they did not contradict each other concerning the important thing
(*e.g.*., the date and hour). And there is a difference between Tanaim
whether such a contradiction is to be taken into consideration, or not?

R. Joseph said: If the husband brought witnesses that she had sinned,
and the father brought witnesses who proved them collusive, the
witnesses of the husband are put to death, but do not pay the prescribed
fine. If, however, the husband brought a third party of witnesses, who
proved collusive the second party, they are to be punished both with
death and with payment of fine to the husband.

Rabha said: If witnesses testify that A had sinned with a betrothed
woman, and thereafter they be found collusive, they are put to death,
but do not pay the fine; if, however, they testified that A had sinned
with the daughter of B, who was betrothed, they pay the fine also. And
the same is the case if they testify that one had connection with an ox,
and they were found collusive; if, however, they testify with the ox of
so and so, they have to pay the fine to the owner of the ox also. But to
what purpose did he state the other case--is it not the same as the
first? Because he himself was in doubt concerning the following case: If
one testified that so and so had connection with my ox, should he be
trusted or not? Shall we say that only a testimony which incriminates
one's self is not to be trusted--because one is kin to himself and
cannot make himself wicked, but in a case where one's property is
involved, we do not say that he is kin to his money, and therefore he
should not be trusted. After deliberating, however, he decided that the
testifying concerning his ox should be trusted, as the latter case is
not taken into consideration.

"The cases of stripes," etc. Whence is this deduced? Said R. Huna: It is
written \[Deut. xxv. i\]: "And they judge them," which is plural, and no
less than two; and as a court must not be of an even number, one is to
be added--hence it is three. In the same verse it reads: "And they
justify . . . and they condemn," which is also plural, and no less than
two -hence two and two are four, and with the three mentioned above it
is seven?

The latter terms are needed for that which Ula said: Where is to be
found a hint in the Scriptures concerning collusive witnesses? \[A
hint--does it not read (ibid. xix. 19): "Then shall ye do unto him as he
had purposed to do unto his brother"?

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Where is the hint
that collusive witnesses are to be punished with stripes?\] From the
above-cited terms, "and they shall justify . . . condemn the wicked:
Then shall it be, if the guilty man deserve to be beaten," etc., which
is not to be understood as meaning the court only, as the words, "they
shall justify the righteous," would be superfluous in that case. And
therefore it is to be explained thus: If there were witnesses who had
made the righteous guilty, and thereafter other witnesses came and
justified the righteous who were indeed right, and made guilty the
witnesses who accused them; then, if the former were to be punished with
stripes, if found guilty, the same punishment is to be meted to the
guilty witnesses.

But is there not a negative commandment in Ex. xx. 16: "Thou shalt not
bear false witness"? This negative commandment is counted among those
who do no manual labor; and for the transgression of such, punishment of
stripes is not applied.

"*In the name of Ishmael it was said*," etc. What is his reason? Said
Abayi: The analogy of expression, Rosha (guilty). It reads \[Deut. Xxv.
2\]: "Guilty man," and \[Num. xxxv. 31\] "Who is guilty of death." As in
case of death, twenty-three are needed, the same is the case with
stripes. Rabha, however, maintains: His reason is simple, as stripes
take the place of that. Said R. Aha, the son of Rabha, to R. Ashi: If so
is the case, why must he be examined by the court to see if he can stand
the forty stripes? Let him be beaten without any examination; and if he
cannot stand them, let him die. And he answered: It reads \[Deut. xxv.
3\]: "And thy brother be rendered vile before thy eyes." Hence if you
beat, you must beat one who is still alive, but not a dead body. If so
(said R. Aha again), why does a Boraitha state that if the examination
shows that he can stand only twenty, he is beaten with that number,
which can be made a multiple of three, say eighteen only? Let him
receive twenty-one; and if be cannot receive the last stripe let him
die, as the last stripe was on a body which was still alive (*i.e.*,
thrice seven are twenty-one, and as he would not die by twenty according
to the examination, the twenty-one would still be on a live body).
Rejoined R. Ashi: The verse reads: "Thy brother thus rendered vile
before thy eyes," which means that after the stripes he shall still be
thy brother, which would not be the case if be died while being beaten.

"To the intercalary month," etc. It does not state for the

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

consideration of the intercalary, nor does it state for the consecration
of the month; but for the intercalary itself, why are three needed? Let
it be not consecrated at the thirtieth day, and it will become
intercalary by itself (*i.e.*, if the thirty-first day be consecrated as
the first of the next month, the past month will be intercalary with one
day). Said Abayi: Read: For the consecration of the month. And so also
we have learned in a Tosephtha: For the consecration of the month and
the proclamation of a leap year, three. So is the decree of R. Meir.
Said Rabha: You say: Read "for the consecration"; but it is stated "the
intercalary." Therefore, he maintains, the consecration in the
additional day (*e.g.*, the thirtieth) must be by three; but after the
day is over, no consecration is needed. And it is in accordance with R.
Elazar b. Zadok, who said (Rosh Hashana, p. 1): If the moon was not seen
at the usual time, no consecration is needed, as it was already
consecrated by heaven. R. Na'hman says: The consecration after the
thirtieth day must be by three; but at the thirtieth no consecration
takes place at all.

And it is in accordance with Plimi, who says in the following Boraitha:
When the moon is seen at her usual time, no consecration is needed; but
if not at the usual time, then it must be consecrated. R. Ashi, however,
maintains: It is to be understood, the consideration if the month should
be intercalary, and the expression "to intercalary" means the
consideration of it. And because it needs to teach to proclaim a leap
year, it says also intercalary. Hence only to the consideration, but not
to the consecration, which is in accordance with R. Eliezer, who said: A
month must not be consecrated at any time, as it is written \[Lev. xxv.
10\]: "Ye shall hallow the fiftieth year," from which we infer that a
year may be consecrated, but not months.

"Rabban Simeon Gamaliel," etc. There is a Boraitha: How was it said by
R. Simeon b. Gamaliel that it began with three, was discussed by five,
and concluded by seven? Thus: If one of the three says it must be
considered, and the other two say it is not needed, then the
individual's opinion is abandoned. If, however, *vice versa*, two more
must be added to discuss the matter; and then, if two say it needs, and
three say no, the majority is considered. And if *vice versa*, then two
more must be added, and the decision is according to the majority.

The numbers three, five, and seven, to what have they a

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

similarity? R. Itz'hak b. Na'hmani and one of his colleagues, who was R.
Simeon b. Pazi, and according to others just the reverse, differ. One
said that the three were taken from the three verses specifying the
blessings of the priests (Num. vi. 24, 25, 26). And the other said:
Three from the "three doorkeepers" mentioned in II Kings, xxv. 18; and
five, from \[ibid. 19l: "The five men of those that could come into the
king's presence"; and the seven from "the seven princes of Persia and
Media" \[Esther, i. 14\].

R. Joseph taught the same as the latter, and Abayi questioned him: Why
did not the master explain this to us before now? To which he answered:
I was not aware that you needed the explanation. Has it happened that
you questioned me, and I would not answer?

The rabbis taught: A year must not be intercalated with one month,
except by them who are invited for it by the Nashi. It happened with
Rabban Gamaliel, who commanded that seven persons should be invited for
the morrow in his attic, for the purpose of the intercalation of the
year, that on the morrow, when he came, he found eight persons, and
said: He who was not invited shall leave. Samuel the Little then arose
and said: I am the one who was not invited. I came here, not to take
part in the intercalation, but to get experience in the practice of this
ceremony. To which the former answered: Sit down, my son; sit down. All
the years which have to be intercalated might be done by you. But so was
the decision of the sages, that such must be done only by the persons
who were invited. (Says the Gemara:) In reality, it was not Samuel the
Little, but some other, and he did so only not to bring shame upon his
colleague. It happened that as Rabbi was lecturing he perceived the odor
of garlic, and he said: He who has eaten garlic shall leave. R. Hyya
then rose and left the place; and every one, seeing R. Hyya go out, did
the same. On the morrow R. Simeon, the son of Rabbi, met R. Hyya, and
questioned him: Was it you who disturbed my father yesterday? And he
answered: Save God! Such a thing would not be done in Israel by myself.
And from whom did R. Hyya learn this? From R. Meir, as is stated in the
following Boraitha: It happened with a woman who came to the college of
R. Meir, saying: One of you has betrothed me, but I do not know who it
was. Then R. Meir arose and wrote her a divorce, and handed it to her;
and after him, all the people in the college did likewise. And from whom
did

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> R. Meir learn
this? From Samuel the Little; and Samuel the Little from Shechanyah b.
Yechiel, who said to Ezra \[Ezra, x. 2\]: "We have indeed trespassed
against our God, and have brought home strange wives of the nations of
the land; yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing." And
he, Shechanyah, learned this from Jehoshua b. Nun, of whom it is said
\[Josh. vii. 10\]: "Get thee up; wherefore liest thou upon thy face?
Israel hath sinned," etc.

The rabbis taught: Since the death of the last prophets, Haggai,
Zechariah, and Malachi, the Holy Spirit has left Israel; nevertheless
they were still used to a heavenly voice. It happened once that they had
a meeting in the attic of the house of Guriah, in the city of Jericho,
and a heavenly voice was heard: Among these people there is one who is
worthy that the Shekinah should rest upon him; but his generation is not
fit. And the sages turned their eyes on Hillel the Elder. And when he
departed, they lamented him. "Woe, pious! Woe, modesty! O thou disciple
of Ezra." The same happened again when they had a meeting in an attic in
the city of Yamnia, and the heavenly voice said: Among these people is
one worthy that the Shekinah should rest upon him, but his generation is
not fit. And the rabbis turned their eyes on Samuel the Little. When he
departed, he also was lamented: "Woe, pious! Woe, modesty! O thou
disciple of Hillel!"

The rabbis taught: A year must not be intercalated without the Prince's
consent. It happened once that Rabban Gamaliel went to one ruler in
Syria, and remained there longer than was expected; and the sages had
intercalated the year on the condition that Rabban Gamaliel should
agree; and then, when he came, he said, "I agree," and the year was
intercalated without any other ceremony.

The rabbis taught: A leap year should not be made unless necessary,
because of the spoiled roads, bridges requiring to be repaired, and
because of the ovens where the paschal lambs were to be roasted, and
they were not yet dry; and for them who reside in exile, and had left
their places for Jerusalem to offer the paschal lamb, but could not
reach in such a short time; but not if there was still snow or cold, and
also not for them who resided in exile and had not as yet left their
places for Jerusalem.

The rabbis taught: A leap year should not be made because of the kids,
lambs, and pigeons which are too young. But this

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

may be taken as a support. How so? Said R. Janai in the name of R.
Simeon b. Gamaliel: We inform you that the pigeons are still soft, and
the lambs still thin, and the time of spring has not yet arrived; and it
has pleased me to add to this year thirty days. An objection was raised
from the following Boraitha: How much is to be added to a leap year?
Thirty days. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel said: One month of twenty-nine days.
Said R. Papa: If they wish, they can make it with thirty days; and if
they wish, with one month of twenty-nine days. Come and see the
difference between the old, mighty generation and that of the new,
modest one. There is a Boraitha: It happened with Rabban Gamaliel, who
used to sit on a step in the court of the Temple, that Johanan his
scribe was standing before him, and three pieces of parchment were lying
before him. And be told him: Take one parchment, and write to our
brethren in Upper Galilee and to our brethren in Lower Galilee: May your
peace be increased! We inform you that the time has come to separate
tithe of the mounds of olives. And take another piece of parchment, and
write to our Southern brethren: May your peace be increased! We inform
you that the time has come to separate tithe of the garden sheaves. And
take the third one, and write to our brethren in exile in Babylon, and
to our brethren in Media, and to all other Israelites who are scattered
in exile: May your peace be increased everlastingly! We inform you that
the pigeons are soft, and lambs thin, and the time of spring has not yet
come, and it pleases me and my colleagues to add to this year thirty
days. (Hence Gamaliel wrote: "pleased me and my colleagues"; and Simeon
his son did not mention his colleagues.) (Says the Gemara:) Perhaps this
happened after R. Gamaliel was discharged and reappointed, as then he
became more modest.

The rabbis taught: For the following three things a leap year is made:
because of the late arrival of spring; of the unripeness of
tree-products; and for the late arrival of Thkhupha (the equinox). <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) When two of the three things occur, the year
is made intercalary; but not if one of them. And when one of the reasons
is spring, all rejoiced. And R. Simeon b. Gamaliel said: When Thkhupha
(the equinox) was the reason. And the schoolmen questioned: How is he to
be understood? Does he mean that they rejoiced when the Thkhupha (the
equinox) was

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

one of the reasons, or does he mean to say that if it was the reason it
suffices to make the year intercalate even without other reasons? The
question remains undecided.

The rabbis taught: For the following three lands the leap year was made:
Judea, Galilee, and the other side of the Jordan. For two of them, but
not for one. If it happened that Judea was one of them, all rejoiced,
because the offer of the omer (as the first of the harvest) was brought
only from the land of Judea.

The rabbis taught: The year is to be made intercalary only in the land
of Judea; but if it was made already in Galilee, their act is valid.
However, Hananiah, the man of Anni, has testified that if the leap year
was made in Galilee it was not considered. And R. Jehudah b. R. Simeon
b. Pazi said: The reason of Hananiah is \[Deut. xii. 5\]: "Even unto his
habitation shall ye refrain," which means, all your repairing should be
only in the habitation of the Omnipotent.

The rabbis taught: A leap year is to be made only during the day-time,
and if it was done in the night it is not intercalate. And the same is
the case with the consecration of the month; it holds good in the
day-time, and not in the night.

The rabbis taught: A leap year must not be made in the years of famine.
And there is a Boraitha: R. Meir used to say: It is written \[II Kings,
iv. 42\]: "And there came a man from Ba'al-shalishah, and brought unto
the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley-bread,"
etc. And we know by tradition that the city of Ba'al-shalishah was the
most fruitful city in the whole land of Israel, in which the fruit
became ripe previous to all other cities; and nevertheless at that time
it was not ripe, but only one kind of grain; and not wheat, but barley,
as so it reads. And lest one say it was before the time the omer was to
be brought, therefore it is written at the end of this verse: "Give it
unto the people, that they may eat." Hence, under such circumstances,
that year ought to have been intercalary. And why was it not made so by
Elisha? Because it was a year of famine, and every one went to the barns
in order to get something to eat, and therefore it was not intercalated.

The rabbis taught: The year must not be intercalary before Rosh Hashana
(*i.e.*, no meeting must be appointed to discuss upon the necessity of
an additional month in the next year). Even if it were so done, it is
not to be taken into consideration. However, if circumstances compelled
them to do so, they may

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

do it immediately after Rosh Hashana; but the additional month must be
no other one than Adar. Is that so? Was not a message sent to Rabha: A
couple came from the city of Lecarte, and caught an eagle, and in their
hands were found things which were made in the city of Luz (*e.g.*,
Thkhalth, for Tshitzith). And by the kindness of the Merciful One, and
because of their unripeness, they were redeemed, and left in peace. And
the descendants of Na'hshun desired to establish one nazib (ruler) more,
but the Aramaic had prevented them. However, the prominent men of the
cities held a meeting, and added one ruler (nazib) in that month in
which Aaron (the high-priest) died. (Hence we see that a meeting about a
leap year was appointed in the month of Ab, as Aaron died in that
month?) <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md)

The discussion, and even the establishment, may be done even before Rosh
Hashana; but it must be kept secret until the day of New Year is past.
But whence do we know that with the above-mentioned word "nazib" they
meant "a month"? From \[I Kings, iv. 7\]: "And Solomon had twelve
superintendents (nazibun) . . . for the king's household, one month in
the year"; but ibid. 19 reads: "Besides the one superintendent (nazib)
who was in the land?"

R. Jehudah and R. Na'hman--one said: One manager over all the
superintendents. And the other maintains that this nazib was for the
intercalary month.

The rabbis taught: A leap year must not be made in one year, for the
next; and also three successive years must not be intercalary. R.
Simeon, however, said: It happened with R. Aqiba, that he established
three leap years, one after the other, while he was in prison. And he
was answered: This is no evidence, as the court had established each
leap year in its proper time.

The rabbis taught: A leap year must not be appointed, neither in the
Sabbatic year nor in the following year. But when were they used to be
established? On the eve of the Sabbatic year. The house of Rabban
Gamaliel, however, used to appoint it for the year following the
Sabbatic.

The rabbis taught: No appointment of a leap year must be because of
defilement. R. Jehudah, however, maintains it may,

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

and adds: It happened with King Hezekiah, who had established such
because of defilement, and thereafter he prayed for forgiveness. As it
is written \[II Chron. xxx. 18\]: "For a large portion of the people,
even many out of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not
cleansed themselves, but ate the Passover not as it is written. However,
Hezekiah prayed for them, saying: "The Lord, who is good, will grant
pardon for this."

R. Simeon said: If they had established it because of defilement, it is
intercalary; and Hezekiah prayed for forgiveness because the law
dictates that only the month of Adar shall be intercalary. He, however,
intercalated the month Nissin. R. Simeon b. Jehudah, however, said in
the name of R. Simeon: He prayed for forgiveness because he seduced
Israel to establish a second passover.

The master said: He intercalated the month of Nissin. Did he not hold
the tradition \[Ex. xii. 2\]: "This month shall be unto you the chief of
months," which means Nissin; and it is written, this is Nissin, but no
other month shall be named Nissin? He erred in that which is said in the
name of Samuel: In the thirtieth day of Adar no intercalary month must
be appointed, because this day was fit that it should be the first of
Nissin. And he, Hezekiah, did not hold this theory. There is also a
Boraitha which states: In the thirtieth day of Adar no month must be
intercalated because it is fit to be the first of Nissin.

But how is it if, notwithstanding this, it was established on that day?
Said Ula: Then the month must not be consecrated on that day. But how is
it if it was consecrated also? According to Rabha, the consecration
abolishes the intercalary; and according to R. Na'hman, both hold
good--the intercalary and the consecration. Said Rabba to R. Na'hman:
Let us see! From Purim to Passover are thirty days; and on Purim we
begin to lecture about the law of Passover. Now, if they should appoint
another Adar on the thirtieth day after the lectures of Passover were
already heard, people would not believe then that another month was
appointed, and so they would use leavened bread on Passover. And he
answered: Why, they would believe, as they know the establishment of a
leap year depends on counting; and they would say that it was not as yet
clear to the rabbis--the reckoning of this year--until the thirtieth day
of Adar arrived.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

R. Jehudah in the name of Samuel said: A leap Year must not be
established unless the Thkhupha was less with a greater part of the
month, which are sixteen days. So is the decree of R. Jehudah. R. Jose,
however, said: Twenty-one days. And both took their reference from \[Ex.
xxxiv. 22\]: And the feast of ingathering at the closing
(Thkhuphat--equinox) of the year. One holds that the whole feast should
be in the new Thkhuphat; and the other holds that it is sufficient if a
few days of the feast should occur in the new Thkhuphat. How is this to
be understood? If they hold that the day in which the Thkhupha occurs is
counted to the past Thkhuphat, why, then, is it necessary for R. Jehudah
that the Thkhuphat shall be less with sixteen, and to R. Jose with
twenty-one days? Even if it would be less with fifteen days, according
to R, Jehudah, and twenty days, according to R. Jose, the whole festival
will not be on the new Thkhuphat according to R. Jehudah, as the
fifteenth day of Nissin, which is the first day of the feast, and in
which the Thkhuphat occurs, is counted to the past Thkhuphat; and also
according to R. Jose, if the Thkhuphat occurs on the twenty-first day,
which is counted to the past, not one of the festival days would occur
on the new Thkhuphat, as the festival begins on the fifteenth, and the
seventh ends with the twenty-first. Therefore it must be said, of the
day in which the Thkhuphat occurs, both R. Jehudah and R. Jose count it
as the beginning of the new Thkhuphat. <span

"*Laying the hand of the elders upon sacrifices*." The rabbis taught: It
is written \[Lev. iv. 15\]: "And the elders of the congregation shall
lay their hands," etc. (The expression in Hebrew is, Vsomkhu Ziqnye
Hoedha"--literally, "and they shall lay," the elders," "of the
congregation.") From the expression Hoedha, which means the
congregation, instead of elders of the congregation, it is deduced that
it means the prominent of the congregation, and from the plurality of
Vsomkhu ("and they shall lay," which means no less than two) and the
plurality of the elders who are also two, it is deduced four persons;
and as the number of the court must not be even, one is added--hence it
makes five. So is the decree of R. Jehudah. R. Simeon, however,
maintains: There is only one

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

plurality in the elders, who are two, and one is added for the purpose
mentioned above, making three only. And there is a Boraitha: To laying
the hand upon the elders, and laying the hands of the elders upon the
sacrifices, three are needed. What does this mean? Said R. Johanan:
Laying the hand upon the elders means, to give one the degree of Rabbi:
Said Abayi to R. Jose: Whence do we deduce this? From \[Num. xxvii.
23\]: "And he laid his hand upon him," etc. Then let one be sufficient,
as Moses was only one person; and lest one say that Moses took the place
of the Large Sanhedrin, who were seventy-one, then say that to confer a
degree seventy-one are needed? This difficulty remains.

Said R. Aha b. Rabha to R. Ashi: Do we lay the hands upon the man to
whom we want to give such a degree? And he answered: We support him with
that, that we name him Rabbi and give him the permission to judge about
fines upon them who deserve it.

Is it indeed so--that one man cannot bestow a degree? Did not R. Jehudah
in the name of Rab say: Behold, the memory of that person shall remain
blessed forever--I mean, R. Jehudah b. Baba, as, if not ben Baba, the
law of fines would be forgotten from Israel. It happened once that the
government passed an evil decree upon Israel, that he who bestowed a
degree should be put to death, and the same should be done with him who
received the degree. The city where the degree was conferred should be
destroyed, and even the boundaries which were used while giving the
degree should be torn out. Jehudah b. Baba then went and sat between two
great mountains, and between two large cities--between the two suburban
limits of the cities of Usha and Sprehen--and conferred the degree of
Rabbi on five elders; and they were: R. Meir, R. Jehudah, R. Simeon, R.
Jose, and R. Elazar b. Shamuas. According to R. Ivia, there was a sixth:
R. Nehomai. When the enemy got wind of it, Jehudah said to them: My
children, run away. And to their question: Rabbi, what will become of
you? he answered: I shall remain before them as a stone which cannot be
moved. It was said that three hundred iron spears were put by the enemy
into his body, making it as a sieve. (Hence we see that even one person
only is authorized to give a degree?) There were some other persons with
him, but they were not mentioned because of the honor of Jehudah b.
Baba. Was indeed Meir elevated by Jehuda? Did not Rabha b. Hanah say in
the name

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

of Johanan that R. Aqiba gave the degree to R. Meir? Yea, R. Aqiba did
so, but it was not accepted; and from R. Jehudah b. Baba he accepted.

R. Jehoshua b. Levi said: The custom of giving degrees must not be used
out of Palestine. What does he mean? Shall we assume that loss of fines
should not be judged at all out of Palestine? This is not so, as there
is a Mishna: Sanhedrins are to be established in Palestine as well as in
other places out of Palestine. He means that one must receive his degree
in Palestine only.

It is certain that a degree of Rabbi is not considered when the bestower
is out of and the receiver is in Palestine. But how is it if the
bestower is in Palestine and the receiver is out? Come and hear: R.
Johanan was troubled for R. Shaman b. Aba, who was not present and could
not receive the degree R. Johanan wished to honor him with. R. Simeon b.
Zerud and his colleague Jonathan b. Ekhmai, according to others *vice
versa*--one of them who was present they supported with a degree, and
the one who was not did not receive such.

R. Hanina and R. Hoseah were two about whom R. Johanan troubled himself
very much, to honor them with the degrees they deserved, but was always
prevented, whereat he was very sorry. Said they to him: Let master not
worry, as we are descendants of the house of Eli. And R. Samuel b.
Na'hman in the name of R. Jonathan said: Whence is it deduced that the
descendants of Eli are prevented by Heaven from receiving degrees? From
\[I Sam. ii. 32\]: "And there shall not be an elder in thy house in all
times"--which cannot be meant literally--"an old man," as it is written
\[ibid. 33\]: "And all the increase of thy house shall die as (vigorous)
men." Hence it means a *degree* of an elder (scholar).

R. Zera used to hide himself so as not to be honored with a degree,
because of R. Elazar's statement: Be always misty, in order to have a
better existence. Thereafter, when he heard another statement of the
same authority, "One is not raised to a great authority unless all his
sins are forgiven by Heaven," then he went to receive a degree. When he
was graduated as a rabbi, his followers sang for him thus: "There is no
dyeing, no polishing, no painting, and nevertheless it is handsome and
full of grace." When Ami and Assi were graduated as rabbis, likewise
people sang of them thus: "Of such men--of such people--appoint rabbis
for us, but not from the sermonisers";

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

and according to others, "not steel-hearted and impudent men"

R. Abuhu, when he came from college in the court of the Zaiser, the
matrons of Zaiser's house used to sing for him: "Great man of his
people! ruler of his nation! candle of light! may thy coming be welcomed
in peace."

"*Case of the heifer*." The rabbis taught \[Deut. xxi. 2\]: Then shall
thy elders and thy judges go forth," etc. Elders, two, and judges, two,
are four, etc. (will be translated in Tract Souta, as the proper place).

"*Plants of the fourth year and second tithe*," etc. The rabbis taught:
What is to be considered second tithe of which the value is not known?
Rotten fruit, sour wine, and rusty coins. They also taught: Such second
tithe must be redeemed by the appraisement of three buyers who all know
the price of such stock; but not by three laymen who do not know the
exact price. Among the buyers maybe a Gentile, and also the owner of the
stock. And R. Jeremiah questioned: How is it if the three were partners?
Come and hear: One and his two wives may redeem the second tithe of
which the value is not known. Hence it is allowed. This is no support,
as this Boraitha may speak of such as were apart in business. *E.g.*, R.
Papa and his wife, the daughter of Aba of Sura (who used to do business
for herself).

"*Consecrated articles*," etc. Our Mishna is not in accordance with R.
Eliezer b. Jacob of the following Boraitha, who said: Even for a small
fork of the sanctuary, ten persons are needed to appraise the value for
redeeming. Said R. Papa to Abayi: R. Eliezer is correct that it needs
ten, as he may hold with the statement of Samuel, who said: Priests are
ten times mentioned in the portion which speaks of consecrated things.
But whence did the rabbis take three? This difficulty remains.

"*Arakhin . . . movable properly*." What are they? R. Giddle in the name
of Rabh said: If one vows, the value of this utensil is to be
consecrated, then it must be appraised for its value, and he must pay.
R. Hisda, however, said in the name of Abayi: It means, if one vows his
own value, and appoints movable property for the collection. R. Abuhu
said: If one vows his own value for the treasurer of the priests, when
he came to collect, if he collects from movable property, three suffice
to appraise it; but if from real estate, ten are needed. Said R. Aha of
Diphthi to Rabhina: It is correct that three are

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

needed to appraise articles which are to be redeemed from the sanctuary;
but why are three needed for bringing into the sanctuary? And he
answered: It is common sense. What is the difference between bringing in
and taking out? The reason of appraisement is because an error can occur
by which the sanctuary would suffer; and this can take place in both
taking out and bringing in.

"*A priest*," etc. Said R. Papa to Abayi: It is correct that R. Jehudah
requires that one of them should be a Cohen, as in that portion a Cohen
is mentioned; but what is the reason of the rabbis, who do not require
him--and for what purpose is a Cohen mentioned, according to them? This
difficulty remains.

"*By ten, and one of them a priest*," etc. Whence is all this deduced?
Said Samuel: In this portion the word Cohenim is mentioned ten times,
and only one of them is needed for itself; and all the others are
considered as an exclusion after an exclusion, as to which there is a
rule that such comes to add something. And therefore we add nine
Israelites to one Cohen. R. Huna b. R. Nathan opposed, saying: Why not
say: Add five Israelites to five Cohenim? This difficulty also remains.

"*The value of men*," etc. But does, then, a man become consecrated?
Said R. Abuhu: If one vows, the money he is worth (not according to age,
which is prescribed biblically) must be appraised as if he were a slave
sold on the market; and a slave is equal to real estate. Therefore it
needs ten: R. Abim questioned: How is it if one vows the value of his
hair, and it should be cut off? Shall we say that things which ought to
be cut off are considered as already cut, and movable, and the
appraisement needs three only; or, so long as it is attached to the
body, it is considered as the body itself, and ten are needed? Come and
hear: If one consecrated his slave, no transgression is committed by
using him for work. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel said: If one uses his hair, it
is a transgression: And we are aware that he speaks when the hair in
question is still attached to the body and is ready to be cut off. Hence
there is a difference of opinion among the Tanaim.

"*The stoning of an ox . . . and the owner put to death*." Said Abayi to
Rabha: Whence do we know this verse means to equal the judgment of the
ox to that of its owner? Perhaps it is meant literally--that its owner
also shall be put to death? Said Hezekiah, and so also was it taught by
his school: It is written \[Num. xxxv. 21\]: "He who smites him shall be
put

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

to death, for he is a murderer." From which we infer that only when he
himself smote is he to be put to death: but he is not to be killed for
the death by his ox.

"*The wolf, the lion*," etc. Said Resh Lakish: This is in case they have
killed some one; but if not, it is not a meritorious act to kill them.
\[Hence we see that he holds that these beasts can be considered the
property of one who domesticates them.\] R. Johanan, however, maintains:
In any case, it is a meritorious act to kill them. \[Hence he holds that
they cannot be domesticated, and are considered ownerless.\]

There is an objection from our Mishna: R. Eliezer says: Every one who
hastens to kill them is rewarded--which is correct according to R.
Johanan, who may explain the word "rewarded"--with the skin of the
animal; but according to Resh Lakish, who said, only when they have
killed, there is a rule that when so it was, the rabbis considered them
as if they were already sentenced to death by the court, and in such a
case it is prohibited to derive any benefit from them. What, then, means
Eliezer by the expression "he is rewarded"? It means that he will be
rewarded by Heaven. There is a Boraitha in accordance with Resh Lakish,
as follows: An ox, as well as other animals or wild beasts which kill,
must be judged by twenty-three. R. Eliezer, however, maintains: An ox
which has killed, by twenty-three; but as to all wild beasts, he who
hastens to kill them will be rewarded by Heaven.

"*R. Aqiba says*," etc. Is it not the same as the first Tana? They
differ in the case of a serpent.

"*A whole tribe*," etc. Let us see what sin a whole tribe may commit.
Shall we assume that it has violated the Sabbath? We know that there is
a difference between an individual and a majority only in the case of
idolatry; but in the other commandments there is no difference,
according to the Scripture. And if it means that the whole tribe was
accused of idolatry, and they should be judged as a majority, then our
Mishna is neither in accordance with R. Jashiah nor with R. Jonathan of
the following Boraitha: How many people must be in the city which shall
be misled? From ten to one hundred. So is the decree of R. Jashiah. R.
Jonathan, however, maintains: From one hundred up to the majority of the
tribe. Now we see that even Jonathan says the majority, but not the
whole tribe. Said R. Mathna: It means the Prince of the tribe only. As
R. Ada b Ahaba explains \[Ex. xviii. 22\]: "Every great matter" means:

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

the matter of a great man; so also here, by the whole tribe is meant the
head of it. Rabhina, however, said: The Mishna speaks of a case in which
the whole tribe was accused of idolatry, your difficulty being, do we
then judge them as a majority? We may say, Yea! although their
punishment is similar to that of an individual who is to be stoned. And
this is in accordance with R. Hama b. Jose, who said in the name of R.
Oseah: It is written \[Deut. xvii. 5\]: "Then shalt thou bring forth
that man or that woman who has committed this wicked thing, unto thy
gates"--which means only an individual, but not the whole city, to thy
gates. The same is the case with a whole tribe; only an individual can
be brought to the gates to be stoned, but not the whole tribe. (Hence
they are judged by seventy-one, as a majority.)

"*False prophet*," etc. Whence is this deduced? Said R. Jose b. Hanina:
From an analogy of expression--"presume"--which is to be found in the
case of a false prophet \[Deut. xviii. 20\] and in the case of a
rebelling elder \[ibid. xvii. 12\]. As in the latter case seventy-two
are needed, so also in the former. But is not the expression
"presumptuously" used in the cited verse concerning death, of which. the
verse reads; and death is judged by seventy-three only? Therefore said
Resh Lakish: The analogy is in the expression "Dobhor," which is
mentioned in both the verses cited.

"*High-priest*," etc. Whence is this deduced? Said Ada b. Ahaba: From
the above-cited Ex. xviii. 22, which is explained as the matter of a
great man.

"*To decide upon battles*," etc. Whence is this deduced? Said R. Abuhu:
From \[Num. xxvii. 21\]: "And before Elazar the priest shall he stand .
. . he and all the children of Israel with him, and all the
congregation." "He" means the king. "All Israel with him means the
priest who was anointed to be the leader of the war. And all the
congregation" means the Sanhedrin. But perhaps the cited verse means
that only for the just-mentioned persons the Urim is allowed to be used;
but not for common men. And the question, Wherefrom is it taken that
seventy-one are needed to decide about battles? remains. Therefore it
must be said, as R. Aha b. Bizna in the name of R. Simeon the Pious
said: A harp was placed over the bed of David, and when midnight arrived
a north wind used to blow in it, so that the harp would play by itself
and awake David, who used to get up and occupy himself with the Torah
until the

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

morning star arose. And thereafter the sages of Israel used to enter to
him, saying: Lord our king, thy nation Israel needs food. And to his
answer: Go, then, and make business among yourselves, they answered him:
A handful of food can never satisfy a lion, and a pit can never be
filled with the earth taken out from it. Whereupon David decided: They
shall go to a battle. Then they consulted Achithophel, took also advice
from the Sanhedrin, and asked the Urim, etc.

R. Joseph said: Whence do we know from the Scripture that such was the
custom? From \[I Chron. xxvii. 34\]: "And after Achithophel (came)
Yehoyada, the son of Benayahu, and Ebyathar; and the captain of the
king's army was Joab. Achithophel was the counsellor, as it reads \[II
Sam. xvi. 23\]: "And the counsel of Achithophel, which he counselled in
those days." Yehoyada means the Sanhedrin, as it is written of his
father Benayahu \[I Chron. xviii. 17\]: "And Benayahu, the son of
Yehoyada, was over the Kerethites and the Pelethites," which means the
Sanhedrin, to whom Yehoyada his son was the head after Benayahu. And why
was the Sanhedrin named Kerethites and Pelethites? Because the literal
meaning of the two terms in Hebrew is "cutting" and "wonder"; and the
Sanhedrin, with their decisions, used to cut off and do wonderful
things. "And Ebyathar" means the Urim Vethumim; and then comes "the
captain of the king's army, Joab," which means war. And R. Itz'hak b.
Ada, and according to others B. Abudimi, said that \[Ps. lvii. 9\]
"Awake, psaltery and harp, I will wake up the morning dawn," is a
support to R. Aha b. Bizna's statement.

"*For enlarging, the city*," etc. Whence is this deduced? Said R. Shimi
b. Hyya: From \[Ex. xxv. 9\]: "In accordance with all that I show thee,
the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all instruments
thereof, even so shall ye make it"--which means, so shall ye do in the
later generations. Rabha objected from the following: "All the utensils
which were made by Moses, the anointment sanctified them; however, the
utensils which were made after him, the using of them for service
consecrated them." And why? Apply, "So shall ye do," etc., to the
utensils also; they shall need anointment in the later generations also?
With this it is different, as \[Num. vii. i\]: "And had anointed them,
and sanctified them," means them with anointment, but not those which
should be made in a later generation. But how is it inferred from the
passage that for the utensils made in the later generations anointing is
prohibited?

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Said R. Papa: It
is written \[ibid. iv. 12\]: "Wherewith they minister in the sanctuary."
We see, then, that the passage makes them sanctified by ministering with
them.

"*Appointing supreme councils*," etc, This is taken from Moses, who had
established the first Sanhedrin; and the person of Moses is equalized to
seventy-one of them.

The rabbis taught: Whence do we know it is a duty to appoint judges?
From \[Deut. xvi. 18\]: "Judges and officers," etc. But whence do we
know that it is a duty to appoint them to each tribe? From \[ibid.,
ibid.\]: "Throughout thy tribes." (From this verse is deduced that
judges as well as officers are to be appointed to each tribe.) R.
Jehudah maintains: It was also necessary to appoint one who should rule
over all the judges; as this verse reads, "Shalt thou appoint," which
means that the Great Sanhedrin, who ruled all the judges in the lower
houses, should be appointed by them. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel said: It
reads: "Throughout thy tribes, and they shall judge," which means, it is
a meritorious act to appoint judges to a tribe from its own people.

"*To condemn a misled town*," etc. Whence is this deduced? From \[ibid.
xvii. 5\]. "Then shalt thou bring forth that man," etc. An individual
you may bring to thy gates, but not the whole city, as said above by R.
Hama b. Joseph (here mentioned Hyya, instead of Hama).

"*Town on the boundary*," etc. Why so? Because it reads, "From thy
midst," but not from a boundary.

"*Nor three of them*," etc. Because it is written \[ibid. xiii. 13\]:
"One of thy cities." But why two? Because of the word "cities."

The rabbis taught: One, but not three. But perhaps one, and not two?
Because it reads cities, two are meant. Hence with the term one, one,
not three, is meant. Rabh used to say at one time that for one court it
is not allowed to make three, but for two or three courts it is allowed;
and at another time he said that it is not allowed to do so, even in
several courts? And the reason is, that Israel must not be made
bald-headed. Said Resh Lakish: This is said only in one country; but in
several countries, it may. R. Johanan, however, is of the opinion that
even then it must not, for the reason that the land should not be
bald-headed. There is a Boraitha in accordance with R. Johanan. Three
misled cities must not be made in the land of Israel; two, however,
may--*e.g.*, one in Judea and one in

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Galilee; but not
two in Judea, nor two in Galilee. And if it were near to the boundary,
even one must not be proclaimed misled; for, should it come to the ears
of the heathens, they might destroy the whole land of Israel. But why
not deduce it from the passage which states "from thy midst," and not
from the boundary? This is in accordance with R. Simeon, who used to
explain the reasons of what is stated in the Scriptures.

"*The Great Sanhedrin*," etc. What is the reason of the rabbis, who said
that Moses was as head of them? Because it reads \[Num. xi. 16\]: "And
they shall stand there with thee," which means, and thou shalt remain
with them. R. Jehudah, who says seventy only, maintains: It was
necessary for Moses to remain with them, that the Shekinah should rest
upon them.

The rabbis taught: It is written \[ibid. xi. 26\]: "And there remained
two men in the camp." According to some, it means that their names
remained in the urn. As, at the time the Holy One, blessed be He, said
to Moses: Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, he
thought: How shall I do it? Shall I appoint six of each tribe? Then
there will be two more. Or shall I take five of each? Then there will be
ten less. Or shall I appoint from two tribes five only, while from the
others six each? Then will I bring jealousy among the tribes. So he
chose six from each, and wrote on seventy tickets "Zaqan" (elder), and
two he left blank; then mixed, and put all of them into the urn. Then he
said: Go, each, and take your ticket. To those who drew "elder," he
said: You are already sanctified by Heaven. But those who drew the
blanks had no claim, as such was their lot.

Similar was the case from \[ibid. iii. 47\]: "Thou shalt take five
shekels apiece for the poll." And to this Moses also said: How shall I
do it? If I should say to one, "Give the shekels," he may answer, "The
Levite has already redeemed me." Therefore he wrote on twenty-two
thousand tickets "Levite"; and on two hundred and seventy-three he wrote
"five shekels," mixed them, put them in the urn, and told the people:
Each shall draw his ticket. To the one who drew "Levite" he said: You
are free, as the Levite has redeemed you. And he who drew five shekels
was told to pay the amount and go.

R. Simeon, however, said: Not their names remained in the urn, but
themselves remained in the camp in doubt, saying: We

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

are not worthy of such a high appointment. And the Holy One, blessed be
He, said: Because ye were modest, I will increase your grace. And what
grace was increased to them? All the seventy had prophesied once, and
ceased; but these two did not cease to prophesy. And what was their
prophecy? They said: Moses shall die, and Joshua shall bring Israel to
his land. Aba Hanin, however, said in the name of R. Elazar: They
prophesied about the quail, saying, "Come up, quail. Come up, quail."
And R. Na'hman said:, About Gog and Magog they prophesied, as it is
written \[Ezek. xxxviii. 17\]: "Then hath said the Lord Eternal: Art
thou (not) he of whom I have spoken in ancient days through means of my
servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days (*Shanim*)
years, that I would bring thee against them?" Do not read *Shanim*, but
*Shnaim*, which means two. And who were the two who had prophesied at
one period, with one and the same prophecy? Eldad and Medad.

It is correct in respect to him who said above that their prophecy was,
"Moses shall die," what is written \[Num. xi. 28\]: "My lord Moses,
forbid them." But in respect to them who said they prophesied about
other things, why, then, should they be forbidden? Because it was not
seemly for them thus to prophesy in the presence of Moses. What is meant
by the words, "forbid them"? He meant to say: Appoint them, they shall
occupy themselves with the needs of the congregation, and they will be
destroyed by themselves.

Whence do we know that three more are needed, as, after all, sentence of
guilt by a majority of two cannot take place; as, if eleven defend and
twelve accuse, then there is only a majority of one; and if ten defend
and thirteen accuse, there is a majority of three? Said R. Abuhu: Such a
case can be only when there is a necessity to add more judges according
to all. (*I.e.*, in case eleven accuse and the same number defend, and
one of them says: I am in doubt. And in such a case all agree that
judges must be added, as the one who is in doubt cannot be counted; and
then two more are to be added. And if the two who were added also
accuse, there is a majority of two.) And such also can be found in the
Great Sanhedrin, in accordance with R. Jehudah, who said: There was an
even number of seventy. R. Abuhu says again: In case more judges are to
be added, an even number may be made in the Small Sanhedrin also. Is
this not self-evident? Lest one say that the one who says he is in

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

doubt is counted, and if thereafter he gives a reason for his decision
after deliberating he may be listened to, he comes to teach us that as
from the time he is in doubt he is not to be counted at all, so after
the deliberation he may not be listened to.

R. Kahana said: If all the persons of the Sanhedrin are accusing, the
defendant becomes free. Why so? Because there is a tradition that such a
trial must be postponed for one night. as perhaps some defence may be
found for him; but if all accuse him, it is not to be supposed that some
will find any defence for him over night, and therefore they are no
longer competent to decide in his suit.

R. Johanan said: The persons who are chosen to be members of the
Sanhedrin must be tall, men of wisdom, of good appearance, and of a
considerable age; and, also, they should understand something in cases
of witchcraft; and they must also know seventy languages, so that they
shall not need to hear a case through an interpreter. R. Jehudah in the
name of Rabh said: In a city in which there are not to be found two
persons who can speak seventy languages, and one who can understand them
although he cannot speak, Sanhedrin must not be established. In the city
of Bethar were three; and in the city of Yamiam were four, namely: R.
Eliezer, R. Jehoshua, R. Aqiba, and Simeon of Tehmon their disciple, who
was not of age to become a rabbi.

An objection was raised from the following: A Sanhedrin in which three
of them could speak seventy languages was considered a wise one; and if
four, it was considered the highest one. We see, then, that three who
could speak were needed? Rabh holds with the Tana of the following
Boraitha: If two, it is a wise one; and if three, it is the highest one.

There is a rule that, where there is to be found throughout the Talmud
the expression "the man who learned in the presence of the sages," Levi
before Rabbi is meant; and where the expression, "discussed before the
sages," Simeon b. Azi, Simeon b. Zoma, Hanan the Egyptian, and Hayanya
b. Hkhinai are meant. R. Na'hman b. Itz'hak taught five persons--the
four mentioned above, and the fifth was Simeon of Tehmon. Where it is
mentioned, "our Masters in Babylon," Rabh and Samuel are meant; "our
Masters in Palestine," R. Abbi is meant; "the judges of the Exile,"
Karna is meant; "the judges of Palestine," R. Ami and R. Assi; "the
judges of Pumbeditha," R.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Papa b. Samuel;
"the judges of Nahardea," R. Ada b. Minumi; "the elders of Sura," R.
Huna and R. Hisda; "the elders of Pumbeditha," R. Jehudah and R. Eina;
"the geniuses of Pumbeditha," Eiphah and Abimi sons of Rabha; "the
Amoraim of Pumbeditha," Rabba and R. Joseph; "the Amoraim of Nahardea,"
R. Hama. If it is said "the Nhardlaien taught," Rami b. Berokha is
meant. But was it not said by Huna himself: "It was said in the
college"? Therefore it must be said that "Hamnuna" is meant. "It was
said in Palestine," R. Jeremiah is meant; "a message was sent from
Palestine," R. Jose b. Hanina is meant. And where it is said, "it was
ridiculed in Palestine," R. Elazar is meant. But do we not find a
message was sent from Palestine: According to R. Jose b. Hanina it is so
and so? Hence R. Jose b. Hanina cannot be meant in the expression,
"there is a message from Palestine"? Therefore it must be reversed.
Where it is said, "a message from Palestine," R. Elazar is meant; and
"it was ridiculed in Palestine," R. Jose b. Hanina is meant.

"*How many shall a city . . . one hundred and twenty*," etc. What is the
reason of that number? Twenty-three of the Small Sanhedrin, and three
rows of twenty-three each (hearers), make ninety-two; and ten idle men,
who must always be in the houses of prayer and learning, make one
hundred and two; and two scribes, two sextons, two parties for defendant
and plaintiff, two witnesses, and two men who may be able to prove the
witnesses collusive, and still two more who could prove the last ones
collusive--hence in the total there are one hundred and fourteen. There
is a Boraitha that in a city in which the following ten things do not
exist, it is not advisable for a scholar to reside, and they are: Five
persons to execute what the court decides; a treasury of charity (which
is collected by two and distributed by three); a prayer-house, a
bath-house, lavatories, a physician, a barber, a scribe, and a teacher
for children. And according to others it was said in the name of R.
Aqiba: In the city should be several kinds of fruit, as the consuming of
fruit enlightens the eyes.

"*R. Nehemiah*," etc. There is a Boraitha: Rabbi said: Two hundred and
seventy-seven. And there is another: Rabbi said: Two-hundred and
seventy-eight. And there is no contradiction, as one Boraitha is in
accordance with R. Jehudah, who needs only seventy for the Great
Sanhedrin.

The rabbis taught: It is written \[Ex. xviii. 21\]: "And place

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

these over them, as rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of
fifties, and rulers of tens." Rulers of thousands were six hundred;
rulers of hundreds were six thousand; rulers of fifties, twelve
thousand; and rulers of tens, sixty thousand. Hence the total number of
the officers in Israel were seventy-eight thousand and six hundred.

destruction of the Temple they had to be raised until a blemish on their

slaughtering? They had to be examined by an expert who understand
blemishes, and was familiar with the entire law; and a permission was
