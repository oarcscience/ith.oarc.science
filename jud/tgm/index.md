This is a collection of Post-Biblical Jewish stories, written for 3rd to
4th graders. However, this book is also thoroughly enjoyable for adults,
not the least because of the finely-drawn illustrations. The anecdotes
include sublime Talmudic humor, tales of resistance to injustice and
persecution, and profound spiritual lessons. It also includes many
incidents of cooperation between Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Written
in a time of looming peril for Jewish people, this book is still
meaningful to people of all faiths today.
