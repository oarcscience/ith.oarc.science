<H3>Links</H3>
<HR>

<P>We routinely trash 'link exchange' emails without reading them.
In fact, our spam filter is set to delete any email with the words 'link' and 'exchange' in it.
</P>
<P>
This issue is more than adequately explained in the <A HREF="faq.htm#links">FAQ</A>.
</P>
<P>
The only way that we will link to your site based on your initiative
is if you <A HREF="volun.htm">volunteer</A>
to create some significant content for sacred-texts.
So if you want a link from sacred-texts, get busy and do something for
this site.
That's how it works.
</P>
<P>
We do add links to other sites occasionally but that is usually because
they have a mission and content which dovetails with sacred-texts.
Usually these sites show up on our radar long
before anyone contacts us about them.
And those sites are very rare.
