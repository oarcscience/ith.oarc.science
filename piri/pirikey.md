\[From "The Oldest Map of America," by Professor Dr. Afet Inan. Ankara,
1954, pp. 28-34.\]

<span id="I">I.</span> There is a kind of red dye called vakami, that
you do not observe at first, because it is at a distance . . . the
mountains contain rich ores. . . . There some of the sheep have silken
wool.

<span id="II">II.</span> This country is inhabited. The entire
population goes naked.

<span id="III">III.</span> This region is known as the vilayet of
Antilia. It is on the side where the sun sets. They say that there are
four kinds of parrots, white, red, green and black. The people eat the
flesh of parrots and their headdress is made entirely of parrots'
feathers. There is a stone here. It resembles black touchstone. The
people use it instead of the ax. That it is very hard . . .
\[illegible\]. JPe saw that stone.

\[NOTE: Piri Reis writes in the "Babriye": "In the enemy ships which we
captured in the Mediterranean, we found a headdress made of these parrot
feathers, and also a stone resembling touchstone."\]

<span id="IV">IV.</span> This map was drawn by Piri Ibn Haji Mehmed,
known as the nephew of Kemal Reis, in Gallipoli, in the month of
muharrem of the year 919 (that is, between the 9th of March and the 7th
of April of the year 1513).

<span id="V">V.</span> This section tells how these shores and also
these islands were found.

These coasts are named the shores of Antilia. They were discovered in
the year 896 of the Arab calendar. But it is reported thus, that a
Genoese infidel, his name was Colombo, be it was who discovered these
places. For instance, a book fell into the hands of the said Colombo,
and be found it said in this book that at the end of the Western Sea
\[Atlantic\] that is, on its western side, there were coasts and islands
and all kinds of metals and also precious stones. The above-mentioned,
having studied this book thoroughly, explained these matters one by one
to the great of Genoa and said: "Come, give me two ships, let me go and
find these places." They said: "O unprofitable man, can an end or a
limit be found to the Western Sea? Its vapour is full of darkness." The
above-mentioned Colombo saw that no help was forthcoming from the
Genoese, he sped forth, went to the Bey of Spain \[king\], and told his
tale in detail. They too answered like the Genoese. In brief Colombo
petitioned these people for a long time, finally the Bey of Spain gave
him two ships, saw that they were well equipped, and said:

"O Colombo, if it happens as you say, let us make you kapudan
\[admiral\] to that country." Having said which he sent the said Colombo
to the Western Sea. The late Gazi Kemal had a Spanish slave. The
above-mentioned slave said to Kemal Reis, he had been three times to
that land with Colombo. He said: "First we reached the Strait of
Gibraltar, then from there straight south and west between the two . . .
\[illegible\]. Having advanced straight four thousand miles, we saw an
island facing us, but gradually the waves of the sea became foamless,
that is, the sea was becalmed and the North Star--the seamen on their
compasses still say star--little by little was veiled and became
invisible, and be also said that the stars in that region are not
arranged as here. They are seen in a different arrangement. They
anchored at the island which they had seen earlier across the way, the
population of the island came, shot arrows at them and did not allow
them to land and ask for information. The males and the females shot
hand arrows. The tips of these arrows were made of fishbones, and the
whole population went naked and also very . . . \[illegible\]. Seeing
that they could not land on that island; they crossed to the other side
of the island, they saw a boat. On seeing them; the boat fled and they
\[the people in the boat\] dashed out on land. They \[the Spaniards\]
took the boat. They saw that inside of it there was human flesh. It
happened that these people were of that nation which went from island to
island hunting men and eating them. They said Colombo saw yet another
island, they neared it, they saw that on that island there were great
snakes. They avoided landing on this island and remained there seventeen
days. The people of this island saw that no harm came to them from this
boat, they caught fish and brought it to them in their small ship's boat
\[filika\]. These \[Spaniards\] were pleased and gave them glass beads.
It appears that he \[Columbus\] had read-in the book that in that region
glass beads were valued. Seeing the beads they brought still more fish.
These \[Spaniards\] always gave them glass beads. One day they saw gold
around the arm of a woman, they took the gold and gave her beads. They
said to them, to bring more gold, we will give you more beads, \[they
said\]. They went and brought them much gold. It appears that in their
mountains there were gold mines. One day, also, they saw pearls in the
hands of one person. They saw that when; they gave beads, many more
pearls were brought to them. Pearls were found on the shore of this
island, in a spot one or two fathoms deep. And also loading their ship
with many logwood trees and taking two natives along, they carried them
within that year to the Bey of Spain. But the said Colombo, not knowing
the language of these people, they traded by signs, and after this trip
the Bey of Spain sent priests and barley, taught the natives how to sow
and reap and converted them to his own religion. They had no religion of
any sort. They walked naked and lay there like animals. Now these
regions have been opened to all and have become famous. The names which
mark the places on the said islands and coasts were given by Colombo,
that these places may be known by them. And also Colombo was a great
astronomer. The coasts and island on this map are taken from Colombo's
map.

<span id="VI">VI.</span> This section shows in what way this map was
drawn. In this century there is no map like this map in anyone's
possession. The--hand of this poor man has drawn it and now it is
constructed. From about twenty charts and Mappae Mundi--these are charts
drawn in the days of Alexander, Lord of the Two Horns, which show the
inhabited quarter of the world; the Arabs name these charts
Jaferiye--from eight Jaferiyes of that kind and one Arabic map of Hind,
and from the maps just drawn by four Portuguese which show the countries
of Hind, Sind and China geometrically drawn, and also from a map drawn
by Colombo in the western region I have extracted it. By reducing all
these maps to one scale this final form was arrived at. So that the
present map is as correct and reliable for the Seven Seas as the map of
these our countries is considered correct and reliable by seamen.

<span id="VII">VII.</span> It is related by the Portuguese infidel that
in this spot night and day are at their shortest of two hours, at their
longest of twenty two hours. But the day is very warm and in the night
there is much dew.

<span id="VIII">VIII.</span> On the way to the vilayet of Hind a
Portuguese ship encountered a contrary wind \[blowing\] from the shore.
The wind from the shore . . . \[illegible\] it \[the ship\]. After being
driven by a storm in a southern direction they saw a shore opposite them
they advanced towards it \[illegible\]. They saw that these places are
good anchorages. They threw anchor and went to the shore in boats. They
saw people walking, all of them naked. But they shot arrows, their tips
made of fishbone. They stayed there eight days. They traded with these
people by signs. That barge saw these lands and wrote about them which.
. . . The said barge without going to Hind, returned to Portugal, where,
upon arrival it gave information. . . . They described these shores in
detail. . . . They have discovered them.

<span id="IX">IX.</span> And in this country it seems that there are
white-haired monsters in this shape, and also six-horned oxen. The
Portuguese infidels have written it in their maps. . . .

<span id="X">X.</span> This country is a waste. Everything is in ruin
and it is said that large snakes are found here. For this reason the
Portuguese infidels did not land on these shores and these are also said
to be very hot.

<span id="XI">XI.</span> And these four ships are Portuguese ships.
Their shape is written down. They travelled from the western land to the
point of Abyssinia \[Habesh\] in order to reach India. They said towards
Shuluk. The distance across this gulf is 4200 miles.

<span id="XII">XII.</span> .... On this shore a tower  
.... is however  
.... in this climate gold  
.... taking a rope  
.... is said they measured

\[NOTE: The fact that half of each of these lines is missing is the
clearest proof of the map's having been torn in two.\]

<span id="XIII">XIII.</span> And a Genoese kuke \[a type of ship\]
coming from Flanders was caught in a storm. Impelled by the storm it
came upon these islands, and in this manner these islands became known.

<span id="XIV">XIV.</span> It is said that in ancient times a priest by
the name of Sanvolrandan (Santo Brandan) travelled on the Seven Seas, so
they say. The above-mentioned landed on this fish. They thought it dry
land and lit a fire upon this fish, when the fish's back began to burn
it plunged into the sea, they reembarked in their boats and fled to the
ship. This event is not mentioned by the Portuguese infidels. It is
taken from the ancient Mappae Mundi.

<span id="XV">XV.</span> To these small islands they have given the name
of Undizi Vergine. That is to say the Eleven Virgins.

<span id="XVI">XVI.</span> And this island they call the Island of
Antilia. There are many monsters and parrots and much logwood. It is not
inhabited.

<span id="XVII">XVII.</span> This barge was driven upon these shores by
a storm and remained where it fell. . . . Its name was Nicola di Giuvan.
On his map it is written that these rivers which can be seen have for
the most part gold \[in their beds\]. When the water had gone they
collected much gold \[dust\] from the sand. On their map. . . .

<span id="XVIII">XVIII.</span> This is the barge from Portugal which
encountered a storm and cam( to this land. The details are written on
the edge of this map. \[NOTE: see VIII.\]

<span id="XIX">XIX.</span> The Portuguese infidels do not go west of
here. All that side belongs entirely to Spain. They have made an
agreement that \[a line\] two thousand miles to the western side of the
Strait of Gibraltar should be taken as a boundary. The Portuguese do not
cross to that side but the Hind side and the southern side belong to the
Portuguese.

<span id="XX">XX.</span> And this caravel having encountered a storm was
driven upon this island. Its name was Nicola Giuvan. And on this island
there are many oxen with one horn. For this reason they call this island
Isle de Vacca, which means, Ox Island.

<span id="XXI">XXI.</span> The admiral of this caravel is named Messir
Anton the Genoese, but be grew up in Portugal. One day the
above-mentioned caravel encountered a storm, it was driven upon this
island. He found much ginger here and has written about these islands.

<span id="XXII">XXII.</span> This sea is called the Western Sea, but the
Frank sailors call it the Mare d'Espagna. Which means the Sea of Spain.
Up to now it was known by these names, but Colombo, who opened up this
sea and made these islands known, and also the Portuguese, infidels who
have opened up the region of Hind have agreed together to give this sea
a new name. They have given it the name of Ovo Sano \[Oceano\] that is
to say, sound egg. Before this it was thought that the sea had no end or
limit, that at its other end was darkness. Now they have seen that this
sea is girded by a coast, because it is like a lake, they have called it
Ovo Sano.

<span id="XXIII">XXIII.</span> In this spot there are oxen with one
horn, and also monsters in this shape.

<span id="XXIV">XXIV.</span> These monsters are seven spans long.
Between their eyes there is a distance of one span. But they are
harmless souls.
