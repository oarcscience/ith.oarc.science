### CHAPTER V

#### THE MARTIAN CYCLE

THE title of this book would naturally commit me to a review of the
Hindoo romance before investigating the Martian cycle. Considerations of
method have caused me to reverse this order. It is better to advance
from the simple to the complex, and while we certainly know less
concerning the planet Mars than of India, the romance which it has
inspired in the subliminal genius of Mlle. Smith is relatively less
difficult to explain than the Oriental cycle. In fact, the former seems
to spring from pure imagination, while in the latter we meet with
certain actual historical elements, and whence Hélène's memory and
intelligence have gained a knowledge of them is an extremely difficult
problem for us to solve. There is, then, only one faculty at work in the
Martian romance, as a professional psychologist would say, while the
Oriental cycle calls several into play, making it necessary to treat of
it later, on account of its greater psychological complexity.

While the unknown language which forms the vehicle of many of the
Martian messages cannot naturally be dissociated from the rest of the
cycle, it merits, nevertheless, a special consideration, and

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

the following chapter will be entirely devoted to it. It does not figure
in the present chapter, in which I shall treat of the origin and the
content only of the Martian romance.

#### I. ORIGIN AND BIRTH OF THE MARTIAN CYCLE

"We dare to hope," says M. Camille Flammarion, at the beginning of his
excellent work on the planet Mars, "that the day will come when
scientific methods yet unknown to us will give us direct evidences of
the existence of the inhabitants of other worlds, and at the same time,
also, will put us in communication with our brothers in space." <span
id="fr_12"></span>[\*](#fn_12.md) And on the last page of his book he
recurs to the same idea, and says: "What marvels does not the science of
the future reserve for our successors, and who would dare to say that
Martian humanity and terrestrial humanity will not some day enter into
communication with each other?"

This splendid prospect seems still far off, along with that of wireless
telegraphy, and almost an Utopian dream, so long as one holds strictly
to the current conceptions of our positive sciences. But break these
narrow limits; fly, for example, towards the illimitable horizon which
spiritism opens up to its happy followers, and as soon as this vague
hope takes shape, nothing seems to prevent its immediate

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

realization; and the only cause for wonder is found in the fact that no
privileged medium has yet arisen to have the glory, unique in the world,
of being the first intermediary between ourselves and the human
inhabitants of other planets; for spiritism takes no more account of the
barrier of space than of time. The "gates of distance" are wide open
before it. With it the question of means is a secondary matter; one has
only the embarrassment of making a choice. It matters not whether it be
by intuition, by clairvoyance, by telepathy, or by double personality
that the soul is permitted to leave momentarily its terrestrial prison
and make the voyage between this world and others in an instant of time,
or whether the feat is accomplished by means of the astral body, by the
reincarnation of disincarnate omnisciences, by "fluid beings," or, in a
word, by any other process whatever. The essential point is, according
to spiritism, that no serious objection would be offered to the
possibility of such communication. The only difficulty would be to find
a mediumistic subject possessing sufficient psychical faculties. It is a
simple question of fact; if such a one has not yet been found, it is
apparently only because the time is not yet ripe. But now that
astronomers themselves appeal to those "unknown methods of actual
science" to put us en rapport with other worlds, no doubt
spiritism—which is the science of to-morrow, as definite as absolute
religion—will soon respond to these legitimate aspirations. We may,
therefore, expect at any moment the revelation so impatiently looked
for, and every

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

good medium has the right to ask herself whether she is not the being
predestined to accomplish this unrivalled mission.

These are the considerations which, to my mind, in their essential
content inspired in the subliminal part of Mlle. Smith the first idea of
her Martian romance. I would not assert that the passages from M.
Flammarion which I have quoted came directly to the notice of Hélène,
but they express and recapitulate wonderfully well one of the elements
of the atmosphere in which she found herself at the beginning of her
mediumship. For if there are no certain indications of her ever having
read any work on the "heavenly worlds" and their inhabitants, either
that of M. Flammarion or of any other author, she has, nevertheless,
heard such subjects discussed. She is perfectly familiar with the name
of the celebrated astronomical writer Juvisy, and knows something of his
philosophical ideas, which, by-the-way, is not at all surprising when we
consider the popularity he enjoys among spiritists, who find in him a
very strong scientific support for their doctrine of reincarnation on
other planets.

I also have evidence that in the circle of Mme. N., of which Hélène was
a member in 1892, the conversation more than once turned in the
direction of the habitability of Mars, to which the discovery of the
famous "canals" has for some years specially directed the attention of
the general public. This circumstance appears to me to explain
sufficiently the fact that Hélène's subliminal astronomy should be
concerned with this planet. It is, moreover, quite

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

possible that the first germs of the Martian romance date still further
back than the beginning of Hélène's mediumship. The Oriental rôle shows
indications of concerning itself with that planet, and the very clear
impression which she has of having in her childhood and youth
experienced many visions of a similar kind "without her noticing them
particularly," gives rise to the supposition that the ingredients of
which this cycle is composed date from many years back. Possibly they
may have one and the same primitive source in the exotic memories,
descriptions, or pictures of tropical countries which later branched out
under the vigorous impulsion of spiritistic ideas in two distinct
currents, the Hindoo romance on the one side and the Martian on the
other, whose waters are mingled on more than one occasion afterwards.

While, on the whole, therefore, it is probable that its roots extend
back as far as the childhood of Mlle. Smith, it is nevertheless with the
Martian romance, as well as with the others, not a mere question of the
simple cryptomnesiac return of facts of a remote past, or of an
exhumation of fossil residua brought to light again by the aid of
somnambulism. It is a very active process, and one in full course of
evolution, nourished, undoubtedly, by elements belonging to the past,
but which have been recombined and moulded in a very original fashion,
until it amounts finally, among other things, to the creation of an
unknown language. It will be interesting to follow step by step the
phases of this elaboration: but since it always, unfortunately, hides
itself in the obscurity of the subconsciousness, we are only cognizant
of it by its occasional

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

appearances, and all the rest of that subterranean work must be
inferred, in a manner somewhat hypothetical, from those supraliminal
eruptions and the scanty data which we have concerning the outward
influences which have exerted a stimulating influence upon the
subliminal part of Hélène. It was in 1892, then, that the conversations
took place which were to prepare the soil for this work of lofty
subliminal fantasy, and planted in Hélène's mind the double idea, of
enormous scientific interest, that she could enter into direct relation
with the inhabitants of Mars, and of the possibility, unsuspected by
scientists, but which spiritism furnishes us, of reaching there by a
mediumistic route. I doubt, however, whether that vague suggestion on
the part of the environment would have sufficed to engender the Martian
dream—since for more than two years no sign of its eruption mainfested
itself—without the intervention of some fillip more concrete, capable of
giving a start to the whole movement. It is not easy, unfortunately, for
want of records of the facts, to assign with precision the circumstances
under which and the moment when Hélène's subconscious imagination
received that effective impulsion, but an unequivocal trace is
discovered, as I am about to show in the contemporaneous report of the
proceedings of the first distinctly Martian seance of Mlle. Smith.

In March, 1894, Hélène made the acquaintance of M. Lemaître, who, being
exceedingly interested in the phenomena of abnormal psychology, was
present with others at some of her seances, and finally begged her to
hold some at his house. At the first of these

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (October 28,
1894), Hélène met a lady, a widow, who was greatly to be pitied. Besides
suffering from a very serious affection of the eyes, Mme. Mirbel had
been terribly afflicted by the loss of her only son, Alexis, seventeen
years old, and a pupil of M. Lemaître. While not yet fully convinced of
the truth of spiritism, it is easy to understand that Mme. Mirbel was
very anxious to believe in that consolatory doctrine, and ready to
accept it, if only some proofs could be furnished her; and what more
convincing testimony could she ask or receive than that of a message
from her beloved child? Moreover, it was probably not without a secret
hope of procuring a communication of this nature that she accepted the
invitation which M. Lemaître had sent her with the idea of procuring
some moments of distraction for the unhappy mother As happens frequently
in Hélène's case, this first seance fully satisfied the desires of the
sitters and surpassed their expectations. Speaking only of that which
concerns Mme. Mirbel, Hélène had the vision, first, of a young man, in
the very detailed description of whom there was no difficulty in
recognizing the deceased Alexis Mirbel; then of an old man whom the
table called Raspail, brought by the young man that he might treat his
mother's eyes, who thus had the double privilege of receiving through.
the table words of tenderness from her son, and from Raspail directions
for the treatment of the affection of her eyes. Nothing in that seance
recalled in any way the planet Mars, and it could not be foreseen from
anything that occurred there that Alexis Mirbel, disincarnated, would
return

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

later under the name of Esenale as official interpreter of the Martian
language.

It was altogether different a month later (November 25), at the second
reunion at M. Lemaître's, at which Mme. Mirbel was again present. On
this occasion the astronomical dream appeared at once and dominated the
entire seance.

From the beginning, says the report of the seance, Mlle. Smith
perceived, in the distance and at a great height, a bright light. Then
she felt a tremor which almost caused her heart to cease beating, after
which it seemed to her as though her head were empty and as if she were
no longer in the body. She found herself in a dense fog, which changed
successively from blue to a vivid rose color, to gray, and then to
black: she is floating, she says; and the table, supporting itself on
one leg, seemed to express a very curious floating movement. Then she
sees a star, growing larger, always larger. and becomes, finally, "as
large as our house." Hélène feels that she is ascending; then the table
gives, by raps: "Lemaître, that which you have so long desired!" Mlle.
Smith, who had been ill at ease, finds herself feeling better; she
distinguishes three enormous globes, one of them very beautiful. "On
what am I walking?" she asks. And the table replies: "On a world—Mars."
Hélène then began a description of all the strange things which
presented themselves to her view, and caused her as much surprise as
amusement. Carriages without horses or wheels, emitting sparks as they
glided by; houses with fountains on the roof; a cradle having for
curtains

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

an angel made of iron with outstretched wings, etc. What seemed less
strange, were people exactly like the inhabitants of our earth, save
that both sexes wore the same costume, formed of trousers very ample,
and a long blouse, drawn tight about the waist and decorated with
various designs. The child in the cradle was exactly like our children,
according to the sketch which Hélène made from memory after the seance.

Finally, she saw upon Mars a sort of vast assembly hall, in which was
Professor Raspail, having in the first row of his hearers the young
Alexis Mirbel, who, by a typtological dictation, reproached his mother
for not having followed the medical prescription which he gave her a
month previously: "Dear mamma, have you, then, so little confidence in
us? You have no idea how much pain you have caused me!" Then followed a
conversation of a private nature between Mme. Mirbel and her son, the
latter replying by means of the table; then everything becomes quiet,
the vision of Mars effaces itself little by little; the table takes the
same rotary .movement on one foot which it had at the commencement of
the seance; Mlle. Smith finds herself again in the fogs and goes through
the same process as before in an inverse order. Then she exclaims: "Ah!
here I am back again!" and several loud raps on the table mark the end
of the seance.

I have related in its principal elements this first Martian seance, for
the sake of its importance in different respects.

The initial series of cœnæsthetic hallucinations,

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

corresponding to a voyage from the earth to Mars, reflects well the
childish character of an imagination which scientific problems or the
exigencies of logic trouble very little. Without doubt spiritism can
explain how the material difficulties of an interplanetary journey may
be avoided in a purely mediumistic, fluid connection; but why, then,
this persistence of physical sensations, trouble with the heart, tremor,
floating sensation, etc.? However it may be, this series of sensations
is from this time on the customary prelude, and, as it were, the
premonitory aura of the Martian dream, with certain modifications,
throughout all the seances; sometimes it is complicated with auditive
hallucinations (rumbling, noise of rushing water, etc.), or sometimes
olfactory (disagreeable odors of burning, of sulphur, of a coming
storm), oftener it tends to shorten and simplify itself, until it is
either reduced to a brief feeling of malaise, or to the initial visual
hallucination of the light, generally very brilliant and red, in which
the Martian visions usually appear.

But the point to which I wish to call special attention is that singular
speech of the table, on the instant at which Mlle. Smith arrives on the
distant star, and before it is known what star is concerned: "Lemaître,
that which you have so much wished for!" This declaration, which may be
considered as a dedication, so to speak, inscribed on the frontispiece
of the Martian romance, authorizes us, in my opinion, in considering it
and interpreting it in its origin, as a direct answer to a wish of M.
Lemaître, a desire which came at a recent period to

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hélène's
knowledge, and which has enacted with her the initiatory rôle of her
astronomical dream.

It is true that M. Lemaître himself did not understand at the moment to
what this preliminary warning referred, but the note which he inserted
at the end of his report of that seance is instructive in this regard:
"I do not know how to explain the first words dictated by the table:
'Lemaître, that which you have so much wished for!' M. S. reminds me
that in a conversation which I had with him last summer I said to him:
'It would be very interesting to know what is happening upon other
planets.' If this is an answer to the wish of last year, very well."

It must be added that M. S., who had been sufficiently struck by this
wish of M. Lemaître to remember it for several months, was, during all
of the time referred to, one of the most regular attendants upon the
seances of Mlle. Smith; and, to one who knows by experience all that
happens at the spiritistic reunions, before, after, and during the
seance itself, there could hardly be any doubt but that it was through
M. S., as intermediary, that Mlle. Smith had heard mentioned M.
Lemaître's regret at our relative ignorance of the inhabitants of other
planets. This idea, probably caught on the wing during the state of
suggestibility which accompanies the seances, returned with renewed
force when Hélène was invited to hold a seance at the house of M.
Lemaître, and made more vivid also by the desire, which is always latent
in her, of making the visions as interesting as possible to the persons
among whom she finds herself. Such is, in my opinion, the seed which,
falling into

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

the ground and fertilized by former conversations concerning the
inhabitants of Mars and the possibility of spiritistic relations with
them, has served as the germ of the romance, the further development of
which it remains for me to trace.

One point which still remains to be cleared up in the seance, as I come
to sum up, is the singularly artificial character and the slight
connection between the Martian vision, properly so called, and the
reappearance of Raspail and Alexis Mirbel. We do not altogether
understand what these personages have to do with it. What need is there
of their being to-day found on the planet Mars simply for the purpose of
continuing their interview with Mme. Mirbel, begun at a previous seance,
without the intervention of any planet? The assembly-hall at which they
are found, while it is located on Mars, is a bond of union all the more
artificial between them and that planet in that there is nothing
specifically Martian in its description and appears to have been
borrowed from our globe. This incident is at bottom a matter out of the
regular course, full of interest undoubtedly for Mme. Mirbel, whom it
directly concerns, but without intimate connection with the Martian
world. It was evidently the astronomical revelation, intended for M.
Lemaître, and ripened by a period of incubation, which should have
furnished the material for this seance; but the presence of Mme. Mirbel
awoke anew the memory of her son and of Raspail, which had occupied the
preceding seance, and these memories, interfering with the Martian
vision, become, for good or ill, incorporated as a strange episode in it
without having

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

any direct connection with it. The work of unification, of
dramatization, by which these two unequal chains of ideas are harmonized
and fused the one with the other through the intermediation of an
assembly-hall, is no more or no less extraordinary than that which
displays itself in all our nocturnal phantasmagoria, where certain
absolutely heterogeneous memories often ally themselves after an
unexpected fashion, and afford opportunity for confusions of the most
bizarre character.

But mediumistic communications differ from ordinary dreams in
this—namely, the incoherence of the latter does not cause them to have
any consequences. We are astonished and diverted for a moment as we
reflect upon a dream. Sometimes a dream holds a little longer the
attention of the psychologist, who endeavors to unravel the intricate
plot of his dreams and to discover, amid the caprices of association or
the events of the waking state, the origin of their tangled threads.
But, on the whole, this incoherence has no influence on the ultimate
course of our thoughts, because we see in our dreams only the results of
chance, without value in themselves and without objective signification.

It is otherwise with spiritistic communications, by reason of the
importance and the credit accorded them.

The medium who partially recollects her automatisms, or to whom the
sitters have detailed them after the close of the seance, adding also
their comments, becomes preoccupied with these mysterious revelations;
like the paranoiac, who perceives hidden meanings

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

or a profound significance in the most trifling coincidences, she seeks
to fathom the content of her strange visions, reflects on them, examines
them in the light of spiritistic notions; if she encounters difficulties
in them, or contradictions, her conscious or unconscious thought (the
two are not always in accord) will undertake the task of removing them,
and solving as well as possible the problems which these
dream-creations, considered as realities, impose upon her, and the later
somnambulisms will bear the imprint of this labor of interpretation or
correction.

It is to this point we have come at the commencement of the astronomical
romance of Mlle. Smith. The purely accidental and fortuitous conjunction
of the planet Mars and Alexis Mirbel in the seance of the 25th of
November determined their definitive welding together. Association by
fortuitous contiguity is transformed into a logical connection.

#### II. LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE MARTIAN CYCLE

This development was not effected in a regular manner; but for the most
part by leaps and bounds, separating stoppages more or less prolonged.
After its inauguration in the seance of November 25, 1894, it suffered a
first eclipse of nearly fifteen months, attributable to new
preoccupations which had installed themselves on the highest plane of
Mlle. Smith's subconsciousness and held that position throughout the
whole of the year 1895.

Compared with the seance of November, 1894, that

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

of February, 1896 (of which a résumé follows), shows interesting
innovations. Raspail does not figure in it and henceforth does not
appear again, which was probably due to the fact that Mme. Mirbel had
failed to make use of the method of treatment which he had prescribed
for her eyes. Young Mirbel, on the contrary, sole object of the desires
and longings of his poor mother, occupies the highest plane, and is the
central figure of the vision. He now speaks Martian and no longer
understands French, which complicates the conversation somewhat.
Further, not possessing the power of moving tables upon our globe, it is
through the intervention of the medium, by incarnating himself
momentarily in Mlle. Smith, that he henceforth communicates with his
mother. These two latter points in their turn cause certain difficulties
to arise, which, acting as a ferment or a suggestion, will later usher
in a new step in the progress of the romance: Alexis Mirbel cannot
return to incarnate himself in a terrestrial medium if he is imprisoned
in his Martian existence; he must first terminate that and return to the
condition in which he again floats in interplanetary space; which
"fluid" or wandering state permits him at the same time to give us the
French translation of the Martian tongue; since, according to spiritism,
a complete memory of previous existences, and consequently of the
various languages pertaining to them, is temporarily recovered during
the phases of disincarnation.

These anticipatory hints will assist the reader in following more easily
the thread of the somnambulistic romance in the résumé of its principal
stages.

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

February 2, 1896.—I sum up, by enumerating them, the principal
somnambulistic phases of this seance, which lasted more than two hours
and a half, and at which Mme. Mirbel assisted.

I. Increasing hemisomnambulism, with gradual loss of consciousness of
the real environment—at the beginning the table bows several times to
Mme. Mirbel, announcing that the coming scene is intended for her. After
a series of elementary visual hallucinations (rainbow colors, etc.),
meaning for Mme. Mirbel that she would finally become blind, Hélène
arose, left the table, and held a long conversation with an imaginary
woman who wished her to enter a curious little car without wheels or
horses. She became impatient towards this woman, who, after having at
first spoken to her in French, now persisted in speaking in an
unintelligible tongue, like Chinese. Leopold revealed to us by the
little finger that it was the language of the planet Mars, that this
woman is the mother of Alexis Mirbel, reincarnated on that planet, and
that Hélène herself will speak Martian. Presently Hélène begins to
recite with increasing volubility an incomprehensible jargon, the
beginning of which is as follows (according to notes taken by M.
Lemaître at the time, as accurately as possible): "**Mitchma mitchmon
mimini tchouainem mimatchineg masichinof mézavi patelki abrésinad
navette naven navette mitchichénid naken chinoutoufiche**" . . . From
this point the rapidity prevented the recognition of anything else,
except such scraps as "**téké. . . katéchivist. . . méguetch**," . . .
or "**méketch . . . kété . . . chiméké**." After a few minutes,

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hélène interrupts
herself, crying out, "Oh, I have had enough of it; you say such words to
me I will never be able to repeat them." Then, with some reluctance, she
consents to follow her interlocutrix into the car which was to carry her
to Mars.

2\. The trance is now complete. Hélène thereupon mimics the voyage to
Mars in three phases, the meaning of which is indicated by Leopold: a
regular rocking motion of the upper part of the body (passing through
the terrestrial atmosphere), absolute immobility and rigidity
(interplanetary space), again oscillations of the shoulders and the bust
(atmosphere of Mars). Arrived upon Mars, she descends from the car, and
performs a complicated pantomime expressing the manners of Martian
politeness: uncouth gestures with the hands and fingers, slapping of the
hands, taps of the fingers upon the nose, the lips, the chin, etc.,
twisted courtesies, glidings, and rotation on the floor, etc. It seems
that is the way people approach and salute each other up there.

3\. This sort of dance having suggested to one of the sitters the idea
of performing upon the piano, Hélène suddenly fell upon the floor in an
evidently hypnotic state, which had no longer a Martian character. At
the cessation of the music she entered into a mixed state, in which the
memory of the Martian visions continually mingle themselves with some
idea of her terrestrial existence. She talks to herself. "Those dreams
are droll, all the same. . . . I must tell that to M. Lemaître. When he
\[the Martian Alexis Mirbel\] said 'Good-day' to me, he tapped himself
upon the nose. . . . He spoke to me in a

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

queer language, but I understood it perfectly, all the same," etc.
Seated on the ground, leaning against a piece of furniture, she
continues, soliloquizing in French, in a low voice, to review the dream,
mingling with it some wandering reflections. She finds, for example,
that the young Martian (Alexis) was a remarkably big boy for one only
five or six years old, as he claimed to be, and that the woman seemed
very young to be his mother.

4\. After a transitory phase of sighs and hiccoughs, followed by
profound sleep with muscular relaxation, she enters into Martian
somnambulism and murmurs some confused words: "**Késin ouitidjé**" . . .
etc. I command her to speak French to me; she seems to understand, and
replies in Martian, with an irritated and imperious tone, I ask her to
tell me her name; she replies, "**Vasimini Météche**." With the idea
that, perhaps, she "is incarnating" the young Alexis, of whom she has
spoken so much in the preceding phase, I urge Mme. Mirbel to approach
her, and thereupon begins a scene of incarnation really very affecting;
Mme. Mirbel is on her knees, sobbing bitterly, in the presence of her
recovered son, who shows her marks of the most profound affection and
caresses her hands "exactly as he was accustomed to do during his last
illness," all the time carrying on a discourse in Martian (**tin is
toutch**), which the poor mother cannot understand, but to which an
accent of extreme sweetness and a tender intonation impart an evident
meaning of words of consolation and filial tenderness. This pathetic
duet lasted about ten minutes,

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

and was brought to an end by a return to lethargic sleep, from which
Hélène awakened at the end of a quarter of an hour, pronouncing a short
Martian word, after which she instantly recovered the use of her French
and her normal waking state.

5\. Questioned as to what had passed, Hélène, while drinking tea,
narrates the dream which she has had. She has a sufficiently clear
memory of her journey and of what she has seen on Mars, with the
exception of the young man, of whom she has retained only a recollection
of the scene of incarnation.

But suddenly, in the midst of the conversation, she begins to speak in
Martian, without appearing to be aware of it, and while continuing to
chat with us in the most natural manner; she appeared to understand all
our words, and answered in her strange idiom, in the most normal tone,
and seemed very much astonished when we told her that we did not
understand her language; she evidently believes she is speaking
French. <span id="fr_13"></span>[\*](#fn_13.md) By questioning her
concerning a visit which she had made a few days before to M. C., and
asking her the number and the names of the persons whom she met there,
we succeed in identifying the four following Martian words: **Métiche
S.**, *Monsieur S*.; **Médache C.**, *Madame C*.; **Métaganiche Smith**,
*Mademoiselle Smith;* **kin’t’che**, *four*. After which she resumes
definitively her French. Interrogated as to the incident

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

which has transpired, she is astounded, has only a hesitating and
confused memory of her having spoken at all this evening of her visit to
M. C., and does not recognize nor understand the four Martian words
given above when they are repeated to her. On several occasions during
this seance I had made the suggestion to Hélène that at a given signal,
after her awaking, she would recover the memory of the Martian words
pronounced by her and of their meaning. But Leopold, who was present,
declared that this command would not be obeyed, and that a translation
could not be obtained this evening. The signal, though often repeated,
was, in fact, without result.

It has seemed to me necessary to describe with some detail this seance,
at which the Martian language made its first appearance, in order to
place before the reader all the fragments which, we have been able to
gather, without, of course, any guarantee of absolute accuracy, since
every one knows how difficult it is to note the sounds of unknown words.
A curious difference is to be noticed between the words picked up in the
course of the seance and the four words several times repeated by
Hélène, the meaning and pronunciation of which have been determined with
complete accuracy in the posthypnotic return of the somnambulistic
dream. Judged by these latter, the Martian language is only a puerile
counterfeit of French, of which she preserves in each word a number of
syllables and certain conspicuous letters. In the other phrases, on the
contrary, also making use of later texts which have been translated, as

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

we shall see hereafter, it cannot be discovered what it is. We are
constrained to believe that these first outbreaks of Martian,
characterized by a volubility which we have rarely met with since then,
was only a pseudo-Martian, a continuation of sounds uttered at random
and without any real meaning, analogous to the gibberish which children
use sometimes in their games of "pretending" to speak Chinese or Indian,
and that the real Martian was only created by an unskilful distortion of
French, in a posthypnotic access of hemisomnambulism, in order to
respond to the manifest desire of the sitters to obtain the precise
significance of some isolated Martian words.

The impossibility, announced by Leopold, of procuring a translation that
same evening of the pretended Martian spoken for the first time during
that seance, and the fact that it could not again be obtained, give some
support to the preceding theory.

The circumstance that Hélène, in remembering her dream in phase No. 3,
had the sentiment of having *well understood* this unknown jargon, is
not an objection, since the children who amuse themselves by simulating
an uncouth idiom—to recur to that example—do not retain the least
consciousness of the ideas which their gibberish is assumed to express.
It seems, in short, that if this new language was already really
established at that time in Hélène's subliminal consciousness to the
point of sustaining fluently discourses of several minutes’ duration,
some phrases at least would not have failed to gush forth, spontaneously
sometimes, in the course of ordinary

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

life, and in order to throw light upon visions of Martian people or
landscapes. More than seven months had to elapse before that phenomenon,
which was so frequent afterwards, began to appear.

May we not see in this half-year a period of incubation, employed in the
subliminal fabrication of a language, properly so called—that is to say,
formed of precise words and with a definite signification, in imitation
of the four terms just referred to—to replace the disordered nonsense of
the beginning?

However it may be, and to return to our story, one can imagine the
interest which that sudden and unexpected apparition of mysterious
speech aroused, and which the authority of Leopold would not allow to be
taken for anything other than the language of Mars. The natural
curiosity of Hélène herself, as well as that of her friends, to know
more about our neighbors of other worlds and their way of expressing
themselves should naturally have contributed to the development of the
subliminal dream. The following seance, unhappily, did not justify the
promise with which it began.

February 16, 1896.—"At the beginning of this seance, Hélène has a vision
of Alexis Mirbel, who announces, by means of the table, that he has not
forgotten his French, and that he will give a translation of the Martian
words another day. But this prediction is not fulfilled. Whether Hélène,
for the reason that she is not feeling well to-day, or that the presence
of some one antipathetic to her has hindered the production of the
phenomena, the Martian somnambulism, which seemed on the point of
breaking

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

forth, did not make its appearance. Hélène remains in a crepuscular
state, in which the feeling of present reality and the Martian ideas on
the level of consciousness interfere with and mutually obscure each
other.. She speaks in French with the sitters, but mingling with it here
and there a strange word (such as **méche**, **chinit**, **chéque**,
which, according to the context, seem to signify *pencil*, *ring*,
*paper*), and appears far away from her actual surroundings. She is
astonished, in particular, at the sight of M. R. occupied in taking
notes by the *procès verbal*, and seems to find that manner of writing
with a pen or pencil strange and absurd, but without explaining clearly
how it was to be otherwise accomplished. The importance of this seance
is in the fact that the idea stands out clearly (which was not to be
realized until a year and a half later) of a mode of handwriting
peculiar to the planet Mars."

This seance, which was almost a failure, was the last of that period.
Hélène's health, which became more and more impaired by standing too
long on her feet and overwork at her desk, necessitated her taking a
complete rest. I have mentioned the fact that during these six months,
without any regular seances, she was subject to a superabundance of
spontaneous visions and somnambulisms; but these automatisms belonged to
the Hindoo or other cycles, and I do not believe that she experienced
during that time any phenomena which were clearly related to the Martian
romance. On the other hand, as soon as she was re-established in and had
returned to her normal mode of life, the latter appeared again with

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

all the more intensity, dating from the following nocturnal vision. (See
[Fig. 9](#img_fig09)..md)

September 5, 1896.—Hélène narrates that having arisen at a quarter-past
three in the morning to take in some flowers that stood upon the
window-sill and were threatened by the wind, instead of going back to
bed immediately she sat down upon her bed and saw before her a landscape
and some peculiar people. She was on the border of a beautiful blue-pink
lake, with a bridge the sides of which were transparent and formed of
yellow tubes like the pipes of an organ, of which one end seemed to be
plunged into the water. The earth was peach-colored; some of the trees
had trunks widening as they ascended, while those of others were
twisted. Later a crowd approached the bridge, in which one woman was
especially prominent. The women wore hats which were flat, like plates.
Hélène does not know who these people are, but has the feeling of having
conversed with them. On the bridge there was a man of dark complexion
(Astané), carrying in his hands an instrument somewhat resembling a
carriage-lantern in appearance, which, being pressed, emitted flames,
and which seemed to be a flying-machine. By means of this instrument the
man left the bridge, touched the surface of the water, and returned
again to the bridge. This tableau lasted twenty-five minutes, since
Hélène, upon returning to consciousness, observed that her candle was
still burning and ascertained that it was then 3.40 o'clock. She is
convinced that she did not fall asleep, but was wide awake during all of
this vision. (See Figs. [10](#img_fig10) and [11](#img_fig11)..md)

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

From that time the spontaneous Martian visions are repeated and
multiplied. Mlle. Smith experiences them usually in the morning, after
awaking and before rising from her bed; sometimes in the evening, or
occasionally at other times during the day. It is in the course of these
visual hallucinations that the Martian language appears again under an
auditive form.

September 22, 1896.—During these last days Hélène has seen again on
different occasions the Martian man, with or without his flying-machine;
for example, he appeared to her while she was taking a bath, at the edge
of the bath-tub. She has had several times visions of a strange house
the picture of which followed her with so much persistency that she
finally painted it (see [Fig. 12](#img_fig12).md). At the same time she
heard on three different occasions a sentence the meaning of which she
does not know, but which she was able to take down with her pencil as
follows: "**Dodé né ci haudan té méche métiche Astané ké dé mé véche**."
(As was ascertained six weeks after, by the translation given in the
seance of the 2d of November, this phrase indicates that the strange
house is that of the Martian man, who is called Astané.)

This phrase was undoubtedly Martian, but what was the meaning of it?
After having hoped in vain for nearly a month that the meaning would be
revealed in some way or other, I decided to try a disguised suggestion.
I wrote to Leopold himself a letter, in which I appealed to his
omniscience as well as to his kindness to give me some enlightenment in
regard to the strange language which piqued our

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

curiosity, and, in particular, as to the meaning of the phrase Hélène
had heard. I asked him to answer me in writing, by means of Hélène's
hand. We did not have to wait long for a reply. Hélène received my
letter the 20th of October, and on the evening of the 22d, seized with a
vague desire to write, she took a pencil, which placed itself in the
regular position, between the thumb and the index-finger (whereas she
always held her pen between the middle and index-finger), and traced
rapidly, in the characteristic handwriting of Leopold and with his
signature, a beautiful epistle of eighteen Alexandrine lines addressed
to me, of which the ten last are as follows, being an answer to my
request that the secrets of Martian be revealed to me:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Ne crois pas qu’en t’aimant comme un bien tendre
frère  
 Je te diroi des cieux tout le profond mystère;  
 Je t’aideroi beaucoup, je t’ouvriroi la voie,  
 Mais à toi de saisir et chercher avec joie;  
 Et quand tu la verras d’ici-bas détachée,  
 Quand son âme mobile aura pris la volée  
 Et planera sur Mars aux superbes couleurs;  
 Si tu veux obtenir d’elle quelques lueurs,  
 Pose bien doucement, ta main sur son front pâle  
 Et prononce bien bas le doux nom d’Esenale!" <span
id="fr_14"></span>[\*](#fn_14.md)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

I have been very sensible to the pledges of fraternal affection that
Leopold has accorded me, but this time I was especially moved, and
although the very uncommon name of Esenale meant absolutely nothing to
me, I took care not to forget the singular rule which had been furnished
me. At the following seance an opportunity for using it presented
itself, and Leopold went so far as to direct himself the application of
his method by giving us his instructions, sometimes with one finger,
sometimes with another, during Hélène's Martian trance.

Monday, November 2, 1896.—After various characteristic symptoms of the
departure for Mars (vertigo, affection of the heart, etc.), Hélène went
in a deep sleep. I had recourse to the prescribed method, but Leopold,
by the fingers of the right hand, indicated that the proper moment had
not yet arrived, and said: "When the soul shall again have regained
possession of itself thou shalt execute my order; she will then describe
to you, while still asleep, that which she shall have seen on Mars."
Shortly after he adds, "Make her sit down in an easy-chair" (instead of
the uncomfortable one which she had taken, as was her wont); then, as
her peaceful sleep still continued, he informs us again that she is en
route towards Mars; that once arrived up there she understands the
Martian spoken around her, although she has never learned it; that it is
not he, Leopold, who will translate the Martian for us—not because he
does not wish to do so, but because he cannot; that this translation is
the performance of Esenale, who is actually disincarnate in space, but
who has

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

recently lived upon Mars, and also upon the earth, which permits him to
act as interpreter, etc.

After half an hour of waiting, Hélène's calm sleep gave way to
agitation, and she passed into another form of somnambulism, with sighs,
rhythmic movements of the head and hands, then grotesque Martian
gestures and French words murmured softly to the hearing of Leopold, who
seems to accompany her on Mars, and to whom she confides some of her
impressions in regard to that which she perceives. In the midst of this
soliloquy a 'vertical movement of the arm, peculiar to Leopold,
indicates that the moment has arrived for carrying out his directions. I
place my hand on Hélène's forehead, and utter the name of Esenale, to
which Hélène replies in a soft, feeble, somewhat melancholy, voice:
"Esenale has gone away . . . he has left me alone . . . but he will
return, . . . he will soon return. . . . He has taken me by the hand and
made me enter the house \[that which she saw in her vision, and of which
she made the drawing a month ago—see [Fig. 12](#img_fig12.md)\]. . . . I do
not know where Esenale is leading me, but he has said to me, '**Dodé né
ci haudan té méche métiche Astané ké dé mé véche**,' but I did not
understand; . . . **dodé**, *this;* **né**, *is;* **ci**, *the;*
**haudan**, *house;* **te**, *of the;* **méche**, *great;* **métiche**,
*man;* **Astané**, *Astané;* **ké**, *whom;* **dé**, *thou;* **mé**,
*hast;* **véche**, *seen*. . . . This is the house of the great man
Astané, whom thou hast seen. . . . Esenale has told me that. . . .
Esenale has gone away. . . . He will return . . . he will soon return .
. . he will teach me to speak . . and Astané will teach me to write."

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

I have abridged this long monologue, constantly interrupted by silences,
and the continuation of which I only obtained by having constant
recourse to the name of Esenale as the magic word, alone capable of
extracting each time a few words from Hélène's confused brain. After the
last sentence or phrase, in which one can see a categorical prediction
of the Martian writing, her weak, slow voice was finally hushed, and
Leopold directs by means of his left middle finger the removal of the
hand from the forehead. Then follow the customary alternations of
lethargic sleep, sighs, catalepsy, momentary relapses into somnambulism,
etc. Then she opens her eyes permanently, very much surprised to find
herself in the easy-chair. Her brain is greatly confused. "It seems to
me as though I had a great many things on my mind, but I cannot fix upon
anything." By degrees she regains a clear consciousness, but of the
entire seance, which has lasted an hour and a half, there only remain
some fragments of Martian visions and no recollection whatever of the
scene with Esenale and that of the translation.

This process of translation, the first application of which is here
presented, becomes from this time the standard method.

For more than two years and a half, the imposition of the hand upon
Hélène's forehead and the uttering of the name of Esenale at the proper
moment during the trance constitute the "open sesame" of the
Martian-French dictionary buried in the subliminal strata of Hélène's
consciousness. The idea of this ceremonial is evidently to awaken by
suggestion—in a

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

certain favorable somnambulistic phase, which Leopold recognizes and
himself announces by a gesture of the arm—the secondary personality
which has amused itself by composing the phrases of this
extraterrestrial language.

In spiritistic terms, it amounts to invoking the disincarnate Esenale,
otherwise called Alexis Mir-bel, who, having lived on both planets, can
easily devote himself to the functions of an interpreter.

The only difference between this scene of translation and other seances
is in the ease and rapidity with which it is performed. Esenale seems
sometimes to be thoroughly asleep and difficult to awaken; Hélène
persists in replying by the stereotyped refrain, and incessantly
repeats, in her soft and melancholy voice, "Esenale has gone away—he
will soon return—he has gone away—he will soon return." Then some more
energetic passes or friction on the forehead are necessary, instead of
the simple pressure of the hand, in order to break up this mechanical
repetition, which threatens to go on forever, and in order to obtain,
finally, the repetition and translation, word by word, of the Martian
texts. Otherwise the voice continues identical with that of the refrain,
soft and feeble, and one can never know whether it is Esenale himself
who is making use of Hélène's phonetic apparatus without modifying it,
or whether it is she herself, repeating in her sleep what Esenale has
told her; the categorical distinctness and absence of all hesitation in
pronunciation of the Martian are in favor of the former supposition,
which is also corroborated by the fact that

it was also in this same voice that Alexis Mirbel (Esenale) spoke to his
mother in the scenes of incarnation. (See [Fig. 13](#img_fig13)..md)

It would be wearisome to recount in detail all the further
manifestations of the Martian cycle, which occur frequently in numerous
seances and also under the form of spontaneous visions in the daily life
of Mlle. Smith. The reader can gain an idea of them both from the
remarks of the following paragraph, as well as from the explanatory
résumés added to the Martian texts, which will be collected in the
following chapter. It merely remains for me to say a word here as to the
manner in which the pictures of Hélène relative to Mars, and reproduced
in autotype in the Figs. [9](#img_fig09) to [20](#img_fig20.md), have been
made.

None of these pictures has been executed in complete somnambulism, and
they have not, consequently, like the drawings of certain mediums, the
interest of a graphic product, absolutely automatic, engendered outside
of and unknown to the ordinary consciousness. They are nothing more than
simple compositions of the normal consciousness of Mlle. Smith. They
represent a type of intermediary activity, and correspond to a state of
hemisomnambulism. We have seen above ([p. 20](ipm04.htm#page_20).md) that
already in her childhood Hélène seems to have executed various pieces of
work in a semi-automatic manner. The same performance is often
reproduced on the occasion of the Martian visions, which sometimes
pursue her so persistently that she decides to execute them with pencil
and brush; work which, in anticipation, often frightens her by its
difficulty, but which, when

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

the time comes, accomplishes itself, to her great astonishment, with an
ease and perfection almost mechanical. Here is an example:

One Tuesday evening, having already retired, Hélène saw on her bed some
magnificent flowers, very different from ours, but without perfume, and
which she did not touch, for during her visions she has no idea of
moving, and remains inert and passive. The afternoon of the following
day, at her desk, she found herself enveloped in a red light, and at the
same time felt an indefinable but violent affection of the heart (aura
of the voyage to Mars). "The red light continues about me, and I find
myself surrounded by extraordinary flowers of the kind which I saw on my
bed, but they had no perfume. I will bring you some sketches of them on
Sunday." She sent them to me, in fact, on Monday, with the following
note: "I am very well satisfied with my plants. They are the exact
reproduction of those which it afforded me so much pleasure to behold
\[No. 3, in [Fig. 16](#img_fig15-7.md), which, beforehand, Hélène despaired
of being able to render well\], which appeared to me on the latter
occasion, and I greatly regret that you were not here to see me execute
the drawing: the pencil glided so quickly that I did not have time to
notice what contours it was making. I can assert without any
exaggeration that it was not my hand alone that made the drawing, but
that truly an invisible force guided the pencil in spite of me. The
various tints appeared to me upon the paper, and my brush was directed
in spite of me towards the color which I ought to use. This seems
incredible,

but it is, notwithstanding, the exact truth. The whole was done so
quickly that I marvelled at it."

The house of Astané ([Fig. 12](#img_fig12).md), and the extensive
landscapes of Figs. [13](#img_fig13) and [14](#img_fig14.md), are also the
products of a quasi-automatic activity, which always gives great
satisfaction to Mlle. Smith. It is, in a way, her subliminal self which
holds the brush and executes, at its pleasure, its own tableaux, which
also have the value of veritable originals. Other drawings, on the
contrary (for example, the portrait of Astané, [Fig. 11](#img_fig11).md),
which have given Hélène much trouble without having satisfied her very
well, should be regarded as simple copies from memory, by the ordinary
personality, of past visions, the memory of which is graven upon her
mind in a manner sufficiently persistent to serve as a model several
days afterwards. In both cases, but especially in the first, Hélène's
paintings may be considered as faithful reproductions of the tableaux
which unfold themselves before her, and consequently give us better than
most verbal descriptions an idea of the general character of her Martian
visions.

Let us see now what kind of information the messages and somnambulisms
of Hélène furnish us in regard to the brilliant planet whose complicated
revolutions formerly revealed to a Kepler the fundamental secrets of
modern astronomy.

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

#### III. THE PERSONAGES OF THE MARTIAN ROMANCE

In using the word "romance" to designate the Martian communications,
taken as a whole, I wish to state that they are, to my mind, a work of
pure imagination, but not that there are to be found in them
characteristics of unity and of internal co-ordination, of sustained
action, of increasing interest to the final dénouement. The Martian
romance is only a succession of detached scenes and tableaux, without
order or intimate connection, and showing no other common traits beyond
the unknown language spoken in it, the quite frequent presence of the
same personages, and a certain fashion of originality, a color or
quality badly defined as "exotic" or "bizarre" in the landscapes, the
edifices, the costumes, etc.

Of a consecutive plot or intrigue, properly so called, there is no
trace. I naturally speak only of that which we have learned from the
seances of Mlle. Smith, or from the spontaneous visions which she
recollects sufficiently to narrate afterwards. But this fails to shadow
forth the hidden source whence they all spring.

Without determining the question, I am inclined, nevertheless, to accord
to the Martian romance, in some profound stratum of Hélène's being, a
much greater continuity and extent than would appear from judging it
solely by the fragments known to us. We have only, in my opinion, a few
pages, taken at hazard from different chapters; the bulk of the

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

volume is wanting, and the little we possess does not enable us to
reconstruct it in a satisfactory manner. We must, therefore, be content
with sorting this *débris* of unequal importance, according to their
content, independently of their chronological order, and grouping them
around the principal personages which figure in them.

The anonymous and mixed crowd which forms the base of some of the
Martian visions only differs from that of our own country by the large
robe common to both sexes, the flat hats, and the sandals bound to the
feet by straps. The interest is confined to a small number of more
distinct personages having each his own name, always terminating in an
*e* with the men and in an *i* with the women, except only in the case
of Esenale, who occupies, however, a place by himself in his quality of
disincarnated Martian, fulfilling the function of interpreter. Let us
begin by saying a few words about him.

##### ESENALE

We have seen ([p. 164](#page_164).md) that this name was hinted at by
Leopold on the 22d of October, 1896, without any other explanation as a
means of obtaining the signification of the Martian words. Then at the
first recurrence to this talisman (November 2d, see [p. 166](#page_166).md)
we learn only that he was a deceased inhabitant of Mars, whose
acquaintance Leopold had recently made in interplanetary space. It was
only at the following seance (November 8th), where we find Mme. Mirbel,
that, after an incarnation of her son Alexis, followed by the scene of
translation (see [text 3](ipm08.htm#an_text03).md) and

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

in response to questions of the sitters—which answered very well the
purpose of suggestion—Leopold affirmed by the left index-finger that
Esenale was Alexis Mirbel. It cannot be determined whether that
identification constituted a primitive fact which it pleased Leopold to
keep secret, only revealing it at the end of a seance at which Mme.
Mirbel was present, or whether, as I am inclined to regard it, it was
only established at that same seance, under the domination of the
circumstances of the moment. As a translator of Martian, Esenale did not
show great talent. He had to be entreated, and it was necessary often to
repeat his name while pressing or rubbing Hélène's forehead, in order to
obtain the exact meaning of the last texts which had been given. He
possessed, it is true, an excellent memory, and faithfully reproduced,
before giving it word by word, the French for the Martian phrases which
Hélène had heard several weeks before and only seen again five or six
months afterwards ([text 24](ipm08.htm#an_text24).md), and of which there
had been no previous opportunity to obtain a translation. But it was to
these latter texts, not yet interpreted, that he confined his
willingness; on two occasions only did he add, of his own accord, some
words of no importance (texts [15](ipm08.htm#an_text15.md) and
[36](ipm08.htm#an_text36). [Text No. 19](ipm08.htm#an_text19.md), for
instance, has always remained untranslated, and my later efforts (June
4, 1899) to obtain the meaning of the unknown words **milé piri** have
been in vain; moreover, Esenale has not been able to fill up the gaps in
text [No. 24](ipm08.htm#an_text24.md).

Alexis Mirbel, after the two first Martian seances,

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

reported on pp. [146](#page_146) and [154](#page_154.md), called Esenale,
often accorded his mother, in scenes of incarnation, somewhat pathetic,
touching messages of filial tenderness and consolation (texts

[11](ipm08.htm#an_text11), [15](ipm08.htm#an_text15.md), and
[18](ipm08.htm#an_text18).md). It is to be noted that, although
opportunities for continuing this rôle were not wanting, he appears to
have completely abandoned it for the last two years: His last message of
this kind (October 10, 1897, [text 18](ipm08.htm#an_text18).md) followed a
month after a curious seance in which Leopold sought to explain to us
spontaneously—no one had mentioned the subject—certain flagrant
contradictions in the first manifestations of Alexis-Esenale. Here is a
résumé of that scene, with the text of Leopold's communication:

September 12, 1897.—After sundry waking visions, Mlle. Smith hears
Leopold speaking; her eyes are closed, and, appearing to be asleep, she
repeats, mechanically and in a slow and feeble voice, the following
words, which her guide addresses to her: "Thou art going to pay close
attention. Tell them now \[the sitters\] to keep as quiet as possible,
that is what often mars the phenomena, the comings and goings, and the
idle chatter of which you are never weary. You recollect there was,
several months ago, a young man, that young man Alexis Mirbel, who came
to give counsel to his mother at a reunion you held with M. (I do not
understand the name he gave) . . . at Carouge <span
id="fr_15"></span>[\*](#fn_15.md) . . . Well, at that moment he
happened—that is to say, two days before—to die on . . . (I could not
understand

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

the name) . . . where he had been . . . or he had regained life. <span
id="fr_16"></span>[\*](#fn_16.md) This is why I have come to tell you
to-day he was in that phase of separation of the material part from the
soul which permitted him to recollect his previous existence—that is to
say, his life here below in this state; he not only recollects his first
mother, but can speak once more the -language he used to speak with her.
Some time after, when the soul was finally at rest, he no longer
recollected that first language; he returns, he hovers about (his
mother), sees her with joy, but is incapable of speaking to her in your
language. <span id="fr_17"></span>[†](#fn_17.md) Whether it will return to
him I do not know and cannot say, but I believe that it will. And now
listen." Here Mlle. Smith seems to awake, opens her eyes, and has a long
Martian vision, which she describes in detail. She now sees a little
girl in a yellow robe, whose name she hears as **Anini Nikaïné**,
occupied with various childish games—*e.g.*, with a small wand she makes
a number of grotesque little figures dance in a white tub, large and
shallow, full of sky-blue water. Then come other persons, and, finally,
Astané, who has a pen in his fingers, and, little by little, takes hold
of Hélène's arm and throws her into a deep trance for the purpose of
causing her to write text [No. 17](ipm08.htm#an_text17.md).

These spontaneous explanations of Leopold are interesting in that they
betray clearly the subliminal desire to introduce some order and logic
into the

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

incoherences of the mediumistic reveries. It is a form of the process of
justification and retrospective interpretation intended to make the
incidents of the past accord with the dominant ideas of the present (see
[p. 95](ipm06.htm#page_95).md). In appearance, the theory upon which
Leopold rested, after having doubtless meditated long, is quite awkward;
but perhaps it was difficult for him to do better, since no one can
accomplish the impossible.

##### ASTANÉ

"The great man Astané" is the reincarnation on Mars of the Hindoo fakir
Kanga, who was a devoted companion and friend of Simandini. He has
preserved in his new existence the special character of savant or of
sorcerer, which he formerly possessed in India, and he has equally
retained all his affection for his princess of old, who has been
restored to him in Mlle. Smith; he frequently utilizes his magic powers
to evoke her—that is to say, to re-enter into spiritual communication
with her, notwithstanding the distances between their actual places of
habitation. The ways and means of that evocation remain, however,
enveloped in mystery. We cannot say whether it was Hélène that rejoined
Astané on Mars during her somnambulism, or whether it was he who
descended "fluidly" towards her and brought to her the odors of the
far-distant planet.

When Astané says to Hélène, during a seance: "Come to me an instant.
Come and admire these flowers," etc. ([text 8](ipm08.htm#an_text08).md), or
shows her the curiosities of his Martian abode, it seems as though he
had really

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

called her to him through space; but when he appears to her, while
awake, at the edge of her bathtub, and expresses his chagrin at finding
her still on this miserable earth ([text 7](ipm08.htm#an_text07).md), it
must be admitted that it is he who has descended to her and inspires her
with these visions of an upper world. It is of no importance, on the
whole. It is here to be noted that, in these evocations, Astané only
manifests himself in visual and auditive hallucinations, never in
tactile impressions or those of general sensibility; in the sphere of
emotion his presence is accompanied by a great calm on the part of
Hélène, a profound bliss, and an ecstatic disposition, which is the
correlative and pendant of the happiness experienced by Astané himself
(texts [10](ipm08.htm#an_text10), [17](ipm08.htm#an_text17), etc..md) at
finding himself in the presence of his idol of the past. The social
state of Astané—I should rather say his name, his quality of sorcerer,
and his previous terrestrial existence in the body of Kanga—was not
immediately revealed.

Nevertheless, at his first apparition (September 5, 1896, see [p.
162](#page_162).md), he rises superior to the crowd, inasmuch as he alone
possesses a flying-machine incomprehensible to us. In the following
weeks Mlle. Smith hears his name, and sees him again on many occasions,
as well as his house ([Fig. 12](#img_fig12).md), but it is only at the end
of two months and a half that his identity and his "evocative" powers
become known, at a seance at which I was not present, and during which
Hélène did not, contrary to her usual custom, fall completely asleep.
The following is a résumé of the notes, which I owe to the kindness of
M. Cuendet:

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

November 19, 1896.—Contrary to the experience of the preceding seances,
Mlle. Smith remained constantly awake, her arms free on the table,
conversing and even laughing all the while with the sitters. The
messages were obtained by means of visions and typtological dictations.
Hélène having asked Leopold how it happens that she had been able to
communicate with a being living on Mars, she has a vision in which
Astané appears to her in a costume more Oriental than Martian. " Where
have I seen that costume?" asks she; and the table replies, "*In
India*," which indicates that Astané is an ex-Hindoo reincarnated on
Mars. At the same time Hélène has a vision of an Oriental landscape
which she believes she has already seen before, but without knowing
where. She sees Astané there, carrying under his arm rolls of paper of a
dirty white color, and bowing in Oriental fashion before a woman, also
clothed in Oriental garments, whom she also believes she has seen
before. These personages appear to her to be "inanimate, like statues."
The sitters ask whether the vision was not a simple tableau (of the
past) presented by Leopold; the table replies in the affirmative, then
inclines itself significantly towards Mlle. Smith, when some one asked
who that Oriental woman might be, and the idea is put forth that
possibly she represents Simandini. Finally, to further questions of the
sitters, the table (Leopold) dictates again that Astané in his Hindoo
existence was called *Kanga*, who was a "*sorcerer of the period*"; then
that "*Astané on the planet Mars possesses the same faculty of evocation
which he had possessed in India*." Leopold is then

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

asked if the power of Astané is greater than his. "*A different power,
of equal strength*," replies the table. Finally, Hélène desiring to know
whether Astané when he evokes her sees her in her real character or that
of her Hindoo incarnation, the table affirms that he sees her in her
Hindoo character, and adds: "*and, in consequence, under those
characteristics which she* \[*Hélène*\] *possesses to-day and which are
in such striking harmony with those of Sima*N*dini*," insisting on the
*N* in the middle of the name.

It is to be remarked that at this sitting it was Leopold who gave all
the information in regard to the past of Astané, and that he recognizes
in him a power over Hélène almost equal to his own. It is strange that
the accredited guide of Mlle. Smith, ordinarily so jealous of his rights
over her and ready to take offence at all rival pretensions, so freely
accords such prerogatives to Astané. This unexpected mildness is still
more surprising when the singular similarity of position of these two
personages in regard to Hélène is considered. Kanga, the Hindoo fakir,
holds in the life of Simandini exactly the same place as Cagliostro in
the life of Marie Antoinette, the place of a sorcerer giving beneficial
counsel, and at the same time of a platonic adorer, and both of them in
their actual rôles of Astané and of Leopold preserve for Mlle. Smith the
respectful attachment which they had for her illustrious former
existences. How is it these two extra-terrestrial pretenders do not hate
each other the more cordially since their rival claims upon Hélène have
identical foundations? But, far from in the least disputing her
possession, they assist each other

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

in the most touching fashion. When Astané writes in Martian by Mlle.
Smith's right hand that the noise of the sitters threatens to make him
insane (see [text 20](ipm08.htm#an_text20).md) it is Leopold who comes to
his rescue in making them keep silent by his gestures with the left arm.
When Leopold indicates to me that the moment for pressing Hélène's
forehead has arrived, it is Astané who lends him his pencil in order
that the message may be written (see below, seance of September 12,
1897, and [Fig. 23](ipm08.htm#img_fig23).md), and the exchange of powers
takes place between them without the medium experiencing the least
shock, and without its betraying itself outwardly otherwise than by the
difference of their handwriting. It is true that Leopold's apparitions
to Hélène are infinitely more frequent and his incarnations much more
complete than those of Astané, who shows himself to her at increasing
intervals, and has never attained to speaking by her mouth. It makes no
difference: these two personages resemble each other too much for mutual
toleration—if they are really two.

My conclusion presses. Astané is, at bottom, only a copy, a double, a
transposition in the Hindoo-Martian manner of Leopold. They are two
variations of one primitive theme. In regarding these two beings, as I
do, in the absence of proof to the contrary, not as real and objective
individualities, but as pseudo-personalities, dream fictions, fantastic
subdivisions of the hypnoid consciousness of Mlle. Smith, it may be said
that it is the same fundamental emotion which has inspired these twin
rôles, the details of which have been adapted by the subliminal

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

imagination to correspond to the diversity of the circumstances. The
contradiction painfully felt between the proud aspirations of the
*grande dame* and the vexing ironies of reality has caused the two
tragic previous existences to gush forth—intrinsically identical, in
spite of the differences of place and epoch—of the noble girl of Arabia,
having become Hindoo princess, burned alive on the tomb of her despot of
a husband, and of her Austrian highness, having become Queen of France
and sharing the martyrdom of her spouse.

On parallel lines, in these two dreams issuing from the same emotional
source, it is the universal and constant taste of the human imagination
for the marvellous, allied to the very feminine need of a respectful and
slightly idolatrous protector, which on the one side has created out of
whole cloth the personage of Kanga-Astané, and on the other hand has
absorbed, without being careful in modifying authentic history, that of
Cagliostro-Leopold. Both are idealistic sorcerers, of profound sagacity,
tender-hearted, who have placed their great wisdom at the service of the
unfortunate sovereign and made for her, of their devotion, amounting
almost to adoration, a tower of strength, a supreme consolation in the
midst of all the bitternesses of real life. And as Leopold acts as guide
for Hélène Smith in the general course of her actual earthly existence,
so Astané seemingly plays the sane rôle in the moments of that life in
which Hélène leaves our sublunar world to fly away to the orb of Mars.

If, then, Astané is only a reflection, a projection

of Leopold in the Martian sphere, he has there assumed a special
coloring, and has outwardly harmonized himself with this new situation.

He is clothed in a voluminous, embroidered robe; he has long hair, no
beard, a yellow complexion, and carries in his hand a white roll, on
which he writes with a point fastened to the end of the index-finger.

His house ([Fig. 12](#img_fig12).md) is quadrangular, with gates and
windows, and reminds one by its exterior aspect of some Oriental
structure, with a flat roof embellished with plants.

The inside is also appropriate. The furniture recalls ours by force of
contrast. We have few details; with the exception of a musical
instrument with vertical cylinders, closely related to our organs, upon
which Hélène sometimes sees and hears Astané playing, seated on a stool
with one foot, resembling a milking-stool.

When we pass to the garden the same amalgam of analogies and
unlikenesses to our flora are discovered. We have seen that Hélène has
been often haunted in the waking state by visions of Martian plants and
flowers, which she finally draws or paints with a facility approaching
automatism; these specimens, as also the trees scattered over the
landscapes, show that Martian vegetation does not differ essentially
from ours. Of the animals we do not know much. Astané has often with him
an ugly beast, which caused Hélène much fright on account of its
grotesque form—about two feet long, with a flat tail; it has the "head
of a cabbage," with a big

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

green eye in the middle (like the eye of a peacock feather), and five or
six pairs of paws, or ears all about (see [Fig. 18](#img_fig18).md). This
animal unites the intelligence of the dog with the stupidity of the
parrot, since on the one hand it obeys Astané and fetches objects at his
command (we do not know how), while, on the other hand, it knows how to
write, but in a manner purely mechanical. (We have never had a specimen
of this handwriting). (See [Fig. 18](#img_fig18)..md)

In fact, as to other animals, beyond the little black bird cited,
without description ([text 20](ipm08.htm#an_text20).md), and a species of
female deer for the purpose of nursing infants ([text
36](ipm08.htm#an_text36).md), Hélène saw only horrid aquatic beasts like
big snails, which Astané caught by means of iron nets stretched over the
surface of the water.

Astané's property is enclosed by large red stones, on the border of the
water, where Hélène loves to retire with her guide to converse in peace
and to recall to mind with him the ancient and melancholy memories of
their Hindoo existence; the general tone of these conversations is
entirely the same as that of her conversations with Leopold.

There is a mountain also of red rocks, where Astané possesses some
excavated dwelling-places, a kind of grotto appropriate to the
sorcerer-savant which he is.

The corpse of Esenale, admirably preserved, is also to be seen there,
among other things, about which the disincarnate Esenale sometimes
floats in "fluid" form, and which Hélène still finds soft to the touch,

when, after much hesitation, and not without fright, she gained courage
to touch it with the end of her finger, at the invitation of Astané. It
is also in this house, excavated in the rock, that Astané has his
observatory, a pit traversing the mountain, by means of which he
contemplates the heavens ([text 9](ipm08.htm#an_text09).md), our earth
included, by means of a telescope, which the beast with the head of a
cabbage brings him.

To these qualities of savant Astané joins those of wise counsellor and
of patriarchal governor. We also see a young girl named Matêmi coming to
consult him frequently (texts [22](ipm08.htm#an_text22.md) and
[28](ipm08.htm#an_text28).md), perhaps on matrimonial affairs, since Matêmi
reappears on several occasions with her lover or her *fiancé*, Siké,
and, among others, at a great family *fête*, presided over by Astané.
(See [Fig. 19](#img_fig19)..md)

The following are some details concerning that vision, which occupied
the greater part of a seance (November 28, 1897). Hélène sees, in a
vast, red, initial light, a Martian street appear, lighted neither by
lamps nor electricity, but by lights shining through small windows in
the walls of the houses. The interior of one of these houses becomes
visible to her: a superb, square hall, lighted at each angle by a kind
of lamp, formed of four superposed globes,—two blue and two white—not of
glass ([Fig. 19](#img_fig19).md); under each lamp a small basin, over which
was a kind of cornucopia pouring forth water. There were many ornamental
plants. In the middle of the hall, a grove, around which are placed a
number of small tables with a polished surface like nickel. There are
young people in Martian robes; young

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

girls with long hair hanging down their backs, and wearing at the back
of the head a head-dress of roses; colored blue or green butterflies
attached to the neck.

There were at least thirty speaking Martian (but Hélène did not hear
them distinctly). Astané appeared "in a very ugly robe to-day," and
showed himself full of friendly gallantry towards the young girls. He
seats himself alone at one of the tables while the young people take
their places at others, two couples at each. These tables are adorned
with flowers different from ours: some blue, with leaves in the shape of
almonds; others starry, and as white as milk, scented like musk; others,
again, the most beautiful, have the form of trumpets, either blue or
fire colored, with large rounded leaves, with black figures. (See [Fig.
20](#img_fig20)..md)

Hélène hears Astané pronounce the name "Pouzé." Then come two men in
long white trousers with a black sash; one wears a coat of rose color,
the other a white one. They carry ornamented trays, and, passing in
front of each table, they place square plates upon them, with forks
without handles, formed of three teeth an inch in length: for glasses
they had goblets like tea-cups, bordered with a silver thread. Then they
brought in a kind of basin a cooked animal resembling a cat, which is
placed before Astané, who twists it and cuts it rapidly with his
fingers, tipped with sharp silver tips; square pieces are distributed,
among the guests, on square plates with furrows around the edges for the
juice. Every one is filled with a wild gayety. Astané sits at each table
in succession, and the girls pass their hands through his hair. New

plates are brought, and pink, white, and blue basins tipped with
flowers. These basins melt, and are eaten like the flowers. Then the
guests wash their hands at little fountains in the corners of the room.

Now one of the walls is raised, like the curtain of a theatre, and
Hélène sees a magnificent hall adorned with luminous globes, flowers,
and plants, with the ceiling painted in pink clouds on a pink sky, with
couches and pillows suspended along the walls. Then an orchestra of ten
musicians arrive, carrying a kind of gilded funnel about five feet in
height, with a round cover to the large opening, and at the neck a kind
of rake, on which they placed their fingers. Hélène hears music like
that made by flutes and sees every one moving; they arrange themselves
by fours, make passes and gestures, then reunite in groups of eight.
They glide about gently, for it could not be called dancing. They do not
clasp each other's waists, but place their hands on each other's
shoulders, standing some distance apart. It is terribly warm. It is
"boiling hot." They stop, walk, talk, and it is then that Hélène hears a
tall young brunette (Matêmi) and a short young man (Siké) exchange the
first words of text [No. 20](ipm08.htm#an_text20.md). Then they depart in
the direction of a large bush with red flowers (*tamiche*) and are soon
followed by Ramié and his companion.

At this moment the vision, which has lasted an hour and a quarter,
passes away. Hélène, who had remained standing during the whole
description, now enters into complete somnambulism, and Astané causes
her to write Martian phrases which she had

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

heard and repeated a short time before. During the entire vision Leopold
occupied her left hand, which was hanging anæsthetically down her body,
and replied by his index-finger to the questions which I asked in a low
voice. I thus learned that this Martian scene was not a wedding, or any
special ceremony, but a simple family *fête;* that it was no
recollection or product of Hélène's imagination but a reality actually
passing on Mars: that it was not Leopold but Astané who furnished this
vision and caused her to hear the music: that Leopold himself neither
saw nor heard anything of it all, yet knows all that Mlle. Smith sees
and hears, etc.

This résumé of a family *fête*, presided over by Astané, gives the
measure of the originality of the people of Mars. The visions relating
to other incidents are of the same order: read the description of the
Martian nursery ([text 36](ipm08.htm#an_text36).md), of the voyage in a
*miza* a sort of automobile, the mechanism of which is entirely unknown
to us ([text 23](ipm08.htm#an_text23).md), of the operation of chirurgery
([text 29](ipm08.htm#an_text29).md), of the games of the little Anini ([p.
176](#page_176), etc..md). We see always the same general mixture of
imitation of things which transpire among us, and of infantile
modifications of them in the minute details.

##### POUZÉ RAMIÉ—VARIOUS PERSONAGES

Of the other personages who traverse the Martian visions we know too
little to waste much time upon them. The name of the one who appears
most frequently is Pouzé. He is present at the banquet, and

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

we meet him also in the company of a poor little withered old man with a
trembling voice, in connection with whom he occupies himself with
gardening or botany, in an evening promenade by the shore of the lake
([text 14](ipm08.htm#an_text14).md). He also figures again by the side of
an unknown person named Paniné, and he has a son, Saïne, who had met
with some accident to his head and had been cured of it, to the great
joy of his parents (texts [23](ipm08.htm#an_text23.md) and
[24](ipm08.htm#an_text24).md).

Finally, we must devote a few words to Ramié, who manifests himself for
the first time in October, 1898, as the revealer of the ultra-Martian
world, of which we shall soon take cognizance. Ramié seems to be a
relative of Astané, an astronomer, not so brilliant as Astané, but
possessing the 'same privilege, which the ordinary Martians do not seem
to enjoy, of being able to take hold of Hélène's arm, and of writing
with her hand. There is, to my mind, no fundamental difference between
Leopold, Astané, and Ramié, in their relation to Hélène; they are only a
reproduction in triplicate of one identical emotional relation, and I do
not think I am mistaken in regarding these three figures as three very
transparent disguises of the same fundamental personality, which is only
a hypnoid subdivision of the real being of Mlle. Smith.

It is much wiser to leave to the future—if the Martian and ultra-Martian
romances continue to develop—the task of enlightening ourselves more
completely as to the true character of Ramié. Possibly some day we shall
also know more concerning the couple called Matêmi and Siké, as well as
many

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

others, such as Sazéni, Paniné, the little Bullié, Romé, Fédié, etc., of
whom we now know scarcely more than their names, and understand nothing
in regard to their possible relationships to the central figures of
Astané and Esenale.

#### IV. CONCERNING THE AUTHOR OF THE MARTIAN ROMANCE

The general ideas which the Martian cycle suggests will most assuredly
differ, according to whether it is considered as an authentic revelation
of affairs on the planet Mars, or only as a simple fantasy of the
imagination of the medium; and meanwhile, holding, myself, to the second
supposition, I demand from the Martian romance information in regard to
its author rather than its subject-matter.

There are two or three points concerning this unknown author which
strike me forcibly:

First: He shows a singular indifference—possibly it may be due to
ignorance—in regard to all those questions which are most prominent at
the present time, I will not say among astronomers, but among people of
the world somewhat fond of popular science and curious concerning the
mysteries of our universe. The canals of Mars, in the first place—those
famous canals with reduplication—temporarily more enigmatical than those
of the Ego of the mediums; then the strips of supposed cultivation along
their borders, the mass of snow around the

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

poles, the nature of the soil, and the conditions of life on those
worlds, in turn inundated and burning, the thousand and one questions of
hydrography, of geology, of biology, which the amateur naturalist
inevitably asks himself on the subject of the planet nearest to us—of
all this the author of the Martian romance knows nothing and cares
nothing. Questions of sociology do not trouble him to a much greater
extent, since the people occupying the most prominent place in the
Martian visions, and making the conversation, in no wise enlighten us as
to the civil and political organization of their globe, as to the fine
arts and religion, commerce and industry, etc. Have the barriers of the
nations fallen, and is there no longer a standing army up there, except
that of the laborer occupied in the construction and maintenance of that
gigantic net-work of canals for communication or irrigation? Esenale and
Astané have not deigned to inform us. It seems probable from certain
episodes that the family is, as with us, at the foundation of Martian
civilization; nevertheless, we have no direct or detailed information in
regard to this subject. It is useless to speculate. It Is evident that
the author of this romance did not care much for science, and that, in
spite of her desire to comply with the wishes of M. Lemaître (see [p.
149](#page_149).md), she had not the least conception of the questions
which arise in our day, in every cultivated mind, as to the planet Mars
and its probable inhabitants.

Secondly: If, instead of quarrelling with the Martian romance about that
which it fails to furnish us,

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

we endeavor to appreciate the full value of what it does give us, we are
struck by two points, which I have already touched upon more than once
in passing—viz., the complete identity of the Martian world, taken in
its chief points, with the world n which we live, and its puerile
originality in a host of minor details. Take, for example, the family
fête ([p. 188](#page_188).md). To be sure, the venerable Astané is there
saluted by a caress of the hair instead of a hand-shake; the young
couples while dancing grasp each other not by the waist but by the
shoulder; the ornamental plants do not belong to any species known to
us: but, save for these insignificant divergences from our costumes and
habits, as a whole, and in general tone, it is exactly as with us.

The imagination which forged these scenes, with all their decoration, is
remarkably calm, thoughtful, devoted to the real and the probable. The
miza, which runs without a visible motor power, is neither more nor less
extraordinary to the uninitiated spectator than many of the vehicles
which traverse our roads. The colored globes placed in an aperture of
the walls of the houses to light the streets recall strongly our
electric lamps. Astané's flying-machine will probably soon be realized
in some form or other. The bridges which disappear under the water in
order to allow boats to pass ([text 25](ipm08.htm#an_text25).md) are, save
for a technical person, as natural as ours which accomplish the same
result by lifting themselves in the air. With the exception of the
"evocative" powers of Astané, which only concern Mlle. Smith personally
and do not figure in any Martian scene, there

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

is nothing on Mars which goes beyond what has been attained or might be
expected to be accomplished by ingenious inventors here below.

A wise little imagination of ten or twelve years old would have deemed
it quite droll and original to make people up there eat on square plates
with a furrow for the gravy, of making an ugly beast with a single eye
carry the telescope of Astané to him, of making babies to be fed by
tubes running directly to the breasts of animals like the female deer,
etc. There is nothing of the *Thousand and One Nights*, the
*Metamorphoses* of Ovid, fairy stories, or the adventures of Gulliver,
no trace of ogres nor of giants nor of veritable sorcerers in this whole
cycle. One would say that it was the work of a young scholar to whom had
been given the task of trying to invent a world as different as possible
from ours, but *real*, and who had conscientiously applied himself to
it, loosening the reins of his childish fancy in regard to a multitude
of minor points in the limits of what appeared admissible according to
his short and narrow experience.

Thirdly: By the side of these arbitrary and useless innovations the
Martian romance bears in a multitude of its characteristics a clearly
Oriental stamp, upon which I have already often insisted. The yellow
complexion and long black hair of Astané; the costume of all the
personages—robes embroidered or of brilliant hues, sandals with thongs,
flat white hats, etc., the long hair of the women and the ornaments in
the form of butterflies for their coiffures; the houses of grotesque
shapes, recalling the pagoda, kiosk, and minaret, the warm and glowing

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

colors of the skies, the water, the rocks, and the vegetation (see Figs.
[13](#img_fig13) and [14](#img_fig14).md), etc.: all this has a sham air of
Japanese, Chinese, Hindoo. It is to be noted that this imprint of the
extreme East is purely exterior, not in any wise penetrating to the
characters or manners of the personages.

All the traits that I discover in the author of the Martian romance can
be summed up in a single phrase, its profoundly infantile character. The
candor and imperturbable naïveté of childhood, which doubts nothing
because ignorant of everything, is necessary in order for one to launch
himself seriously upon an enterprise such as the pretended exact and
authentic depictions of an unknown world. An adult, in the least
cultivated and having some experience of life, would never waste time in
elaborating similar nonsense—Mlle. Smith less than any one, intelligent
and cultivated as she is in her normal state.

This provisional view of the author of the Martian cycle will find its
confirmation and its complement in the following chapters, in which we
shall examine the Martian language, from which I have until now
refrained.
