### CHAPTER VI

#### THE MARTIAN CYCLE (CONTINUED)—THE MARTIAN LANGUAGE

OF the various automatic phenomena, the "speaking in tongues" is one
which at all times has most aroused curiosity, while at the same time
little accurate knowledge concerning it has been obtainable, on account
of the difficulty of collecting correctly the confused and
unintelligible words as they gush forth.

The phonograph, which has already been employed in some exceptional
cases, like that of Le Baron, will doubtless some day render inestimable
service to this kind of study, but it leaves much still to be desired at
the present moment, from the point of view of its practical utilization
in the case of subjects not in their right mind, who are not easily
manageable, and who will not remain quiet long enough while uttering
their unusual words to allow the instrument to be adjusted and made
ready.

There are different species of glossolalia. Simple, incoherent
utterances, in a state of ecstasy, interspersed with emotional
exclamations, which are sometimes produced in certain surcharged
religious environments, is another matter altogether from the creation
of neologisms, which are met with in the

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

dream, in somnambulism, mental alienation, or in children. At the same
time this fabrication of arbitrary words raises other problems—as, for
example, the occasional use of foreign idioms unknown to the subject (at
least, apparently), but which really exist. In each of these cases it is
necessary to examine further whether, and in what measure, the
individual attributes a fixed meaning to the sounds which he utters,
whether he understands (or has, at least, the impression of
understanding) his own words, or whether it is only a question of a
mechanical and meaningless derangement of the phonetic apparatus, or,
again, whether this jargon, unintelligible to the ordinary personality,
expresses the ideas of some secondary personality. All these forms,
moreover, vary in shades and degrees, and there are, in addition, those
mixed cases, possibly the more frequent, where all the forms are mingled
and combined. The same individual, and sometimes in the course of the
same spasm, also exhibits a series of neologisms, comprehended or
uncomprehended, giving way to a simple, incoherent verbiage in common
language, or vice versa, etc.

A good description and rational classification of all these categories
and varieties of glossolalia would be of very great interest. I cannot
think of attempting such a study here, having enough already to fully
occupy my attention, by reason of having involved myself with the
Martian of Mlle. Smith. This somnambulistic language does not consist,
as we have already discovered, either in speaking ecstatically or in
religious enthusiasm, nor yet in

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

the use of a foreign language which really exists; it represents rather
neologism carried to its highest expression and practised in a
systematic fashion, with a very precise signification, by a secondary
personality unknown to the normal self. It is a typical case of
"glosso-poesy," of complete fabrication of all the parts of a new
language by a subconscious activity. I have many times regretted that
those who have witnessed analogous phenomena—as, for example, Kerner,
with the *Seeress of Prevost*—have not gathered together and published
in their entirety all the products of this singular method of performing
their functions on the part of the verbal faculties. Undoubtedly each
case taken by itself seems a simple anomaly, a pure arbitrary curiosity,
and without any bearing; but who knows whether the collection of a large
number of these psychological bibelots, as yet few enough in their
total, would not end in some unexpected light? Exceptional facts are
often the most instructive.

In order to avoid falling into the same errors of negligence, not
knowing where to stop, in case I wished to make a choice, I have taken
the course of setting forth here in full all the Martian texts which we
have been able to gather. I will have them follow a paragraph containing
certain remarks which that unknown language has suggested to me; but,
very far from flattering myself that I have exhausted the subject, I
earnestly hope that it will find readers more competent than myself to
correct and complete my observations, since I must acknowledge that as a
linguist and philologist I am very much

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

like an ass playing the flute. It is expedient, in beginning, to give
some further details regarding the various psychological methods of
manifestation of that unknown tongue.

#### I. VERBAL MARTIAN AUTOMATISMS

I have described in the preceding chapter, and will not now return to
it, the birth of the Martian language, indissolubly bound up with that
of the romance itself, from the 2d of February, 1896, up to the
inauguration of the process of translation by the entrance of Esenale
upon the scene on the 2d of November following (see pp.
[154](ipm07.htm#page_154)-[165](ipm07.htm#page_165).md). During several
months thereafter the Martian language is confined to the two
psychological forms of apparition in which it seems to have been clothed
during the course of that first year.

First: *Verbo-auditive* automatism, hallucinations of hearing
accompanying visions in the waking state. In the case of spontaneous
visions, Hélène notes in pencil, either during the vision itself or
immediately afterwards, the unintelligible sounds which strike her ear;
but to her great regret many of them escape her, since she is sometimes
only able to gather the first or the last phrase of the sentences which
her imaginary personages address to her, or scattered fragments of
conversations which she holds with herself; these fragments themselves
often contain inaccuracies, which are ultimately rectified at the moment
of translation, Esenale having the good habit of articulating very
clearly each Martian word before giving its

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> French equivalent.
In the case of the visions which she has at the seances, Hélène slowly
repeats the words she hears without understanding them, and the sitters
make note of them more or less correctly.

Secondly: *Vocal* automatism ("verbo-motor hallucinations of
articulation," in the cumbersome official terminology). Here again it is
the sitters who gather as much as they can of the strange words
pronounced in a state of trance, but that is very little, since Hélène,
in her Martian state, often speaks with a tremendous volubility.
Moreover, a distinction must be made between the relatively clear and
brief phrases which are later translated by Esenale, and the rapid and
confused gibberish the signification of which can never be obtained,
probably because it really has none, but is only a pseudo-language (see
pp. [154](ipm07.htm#page_154)-[159](ipm07.htm#page_159).md).

A new process of communication, the handwriting, made its appearance in
August, 1897, with a delay of perhaps eighteen months as to the speech
(the reverse of Leopold's case, who wrote a long time before speaking).
It is produced, also, under two forms, which constitute a pendant to the
two cases given above, and also complete the standard quartette of the
psychological modalities of language.

Thirdly: *Verbo-visual* automatism—that is, apparitions of exotic
characters before Hélène's eyes when awake, who copies them as
faithfully as possible in a drawing, without knowing the meaning of the
mysterious hieroglyphics.

Fourthly: *Graphic* automatism—*i.e.*, writing traced

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

by the hand of Hélène while completely entranced and incarnating a
Martian personage. In this case the characters are generally smaller,
more regular, better formed than in the drawings of the preceding case.
A certain number of occasions, when the name has been pronounced by
Hélène before being written, and especially the articulation of Esenale
at the moment of translation, have permitted the relations between her
vocal sounds and the graphic signs of the Martian language to be
established.

It is to be noted that these four automatic manifestations do not
inflict an equal injury upon the normal personality of Mlle. Smith. As a
rule, the verbo-auditive and verbo-visual hallucinations only suppress
her consciousness of present reality; they leave her a freedom of mind
which, if not complete, is at least sufficient to permit her to observe
in a reflective manner these sensorial automatisms, to engrave them on
her memory, and to describe them or make a copy of them, while she often
adds remarks testifying to a certain critical sense. On the contrary,
the verbo-motor hallucinations of articulation or of writing seem to be
incompatible with her preservation of the waking state, and are followed
by amnesia. Hélène is always totally absent or entranced while her hand
writes mechanically, and if, as seldom happens, she speaks Martian
automatically, outside of the moments of complete incarnation, she is
not aware of it, and does not recollect it. This incapacity of the
normal personality of Mlle. Smith to observe at the time or remember
afterwards her verbo motor automatisms denotes

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

a more profound perturbation than that she experiences during her
sensory automatisms.

The Martian handwriting only appeared at the end of a prolonged period
of incubation, which betrayed itself in several incidents, and was
certainly stimulated by various exterior suggestions during a year and a
half at least. The following are the principal dates of this
development.

February 16, 1896.—The idea of a special handwriting belonging to the
planet Mars occurs for the first time to Hélène's astonishment in a
Martian semi-trance (see [p. 162](ipm07.htm#page_162).md).

November 2.—Handwriting is clearly predicted in the phrase, "Astané will
teach me to write," uttered by Hélène in a Martian trance, after the
scene of the translation by Esenale (see [p. 166](ipm07.htm#page_166).md).

November 8.—After the translation of text [No. 3](ipm08.htm#an_text03.md),
Leopold, being questioned, replies that Astané will write this text for
Mlle. Smith, but the prediction is not fulfilled.

May 23, 1897.—The announcement of Martian handwriting becomes more
precise. "Presently," says Astané to Hélène, "thou wilt be able to trace
our handwriting, and thou wilt possess in thy hands the characters of
our language" ([text 12](ipm08.htm#an_text12).md).

June 20.—At the beginning of a seance, a Martian vision, she demands of
an imaginary interlocutor "a large ring which comes to a point, and with
which one can write." This description applies to M. R., who has with
him some small pocket-pens of this kind, capable of being adjusted to
the end of the index-finger.

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

June 23.—I hand Hélène the two small pocket-pens which M. R. has brought
for her, but they do not please her. After trying to use one, she throws
it away and takes up a pencil, saying that if she must write Martian,
the ordinary means will suffice as well as those peculiar pocket-pens.
In about a minute she falls asleep, and her hand begins automatically to
trace a message in Leopold's handwriting. I then ask that individual
whether the pocket-pens of M. R. do not meet the exigencies of Martian,
and whether Mlle. Smith will some day write that language, as has
already been announced. Hélène's hand thereupon responds in the
beautiful calligraphy of Leopold: "I have not yet seen the instrument
which the inhabitants of the planet Mars use in writing their language,
but I can and do affirm that the thing will happen, as has been
announced to you.—<span class="smallcaps">Leopold</span>."

June 27.—In the scene of the translation of [text
15](ipm08.htm#an_text15.md), Hélène adds to her usual refrain, "Esenale has
gone away; he will soon return; he will soon write."

August 3.—Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon Hélène had a
vision at her desk, lasting ten or fifteen minutes, of a broad,
horizontal bar, flame-colored, then changing to brick-red, and which by
degrees became rose-tinted, on which were a multitude of strange
characters, which she supposes to be the Martian letters of the
alphabet, on account of the color. These characters floated in space
before and round about her. Analogous visions occur in the course of the
weeks immediately following.

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

August 22.—Hélène for the first time writes in Martian. After various
non-Martian visions Mlle. Smith turns away from the window (it rained
hard, and the sky was very gray) and exclaims, "Oh, look, it is all red!
Is it already time to go to bed? M. Lemaître, are you there? Do you see
how red it is? I see Astané, who is there, in that red; I only see his
head and the ends of his fingers; he has no robe; and here is the other
(Esenale) with him. They both have some letters at the ends of their
fingers on a bit of paper. Quick, give me some paper!" A blank sheet and
the pocket-pen are handed to her, which latter she disdainfully throws
down. She accepts an ordinary pencil, which she holds in her customary
fashion, between her middle and index-finger, then writes from left to
right the three first lines of [Fig. 21](#img_fig21.md), looking
attentively towards the window at her fictitious model before tracing
each letter, and adding certain oral notes, according to which there are
some words which she sees written in black characters on the three
papers—or, more correctly, on three white wands, a sort of narrow
cylinder, somewhat flattened out—which Astané, Esenale, and a third
personage whose name she does not know but whose description corresponds
with that of Pouzé, hold in their right hands. After which she a gain
sees another paper or cylinder, which Astané holds above his head, and
which bears also some words which she undertakes to copy (the three last
lines of [Fig. 21](#img_fig21), [p. 205](#page_205).md). " Oh, it is a
pity," says she, on coming to the end of the fourth line, "it is all on
one line, and I have no more room." She

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

then writes underneath the three letters of line 5, and without saying
anything adds line 6. Then she resumes: "How dark it is with you . . .
the sun has entirely gone down" (it still rains very hard). "No one
more! nothing more!" She remains in contemplation before that which she
has written, then sees Astané again near the table, who again shows her
a paper, the same, she thinks, as the former one. "But no, it is not
altogether the same there is one mistake, it is there \[she points to
the fourth line towards the end\] . . . Ah, I do not see more!" Then,
presently she adds: "He showed me something else; there was a mistake,
but I was not able to see it. It is very difficult. While I was writing,
it was not I myself, I could not feel my arms. It was difficult, because
when I raised my head I no longer saw the letters well. It was like a
Greek design."

At this moment Hélène recovered from the state of obscuration, from
which she emerged with difficulty, which had accompanied the Martian
vision and the automatic copy of the verbo-visual text. But a little
later in the evening she only vaguely remembered having seen strange
letters, and was altogether ignorant of having written anything.

The very natural supposition that the three first words written were the
names of the known personages (Astané, Esenale, Pouzé), who bore them on
their wands, led to the discovery of the meaning of many of the Martian
characters and permitted the divining of the sense of the three last
words.

The new alphabet was enriched by certain other

signs on the following days, thanks to the echoes of that seance in the
ordinary life of Hélène, who happened on several occasions to write not
the true Martian as yet, but French in Martian letters, to her great
stupefaction when she found herself after a while in the presence of
these unknown hieroglyphics.

</div>

The first manifestation of that graphic automatism, being as yet
concerned only with the form of the letters and not the vocabulary,
dates from the day after the following seance:

August 23.—"Here," wrote Hélène to me at noon, sending me some memoranda
from which I have taken the three examples of Fig. 22—"here are some
labels which I made it my business to make this morning at ten o'clock,
and which I have not been able to finish in a satisfactory manner. I
have only just now emerged from the rose-colored fog in which I have
been continuously enwrapped for almost two hours."

Three weeks later a complete automatic Martian handwriting was produced
in a seance at my house, of which the following is a summary.

September 12, 1897.—At the end of a quite long Martian vision, Mlle.
Smith sees Astané, who has something at the end of his finger and who
signs to

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

her to write. I offer her a pencil, and after various tergiversations
she slowly begins to trace some Martian characters ([Fig.
23](#img_fig23).md). Astané has possession of her arm, and she is, during
this time, altogether anæsthetic and absent. Leopold, on the contrary,
is at hand, and gives various indications of his presence.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> At the end of the
sixth line she seems to half awaken, and murmurs, "I am not afraid; no,
I am not afraid." Then she again falls into a dream in order to write
the four last words (which signify "*Then do not fear*," and which are
the response of Astané to her exclamation).

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

Almost immediately Leopold substitutes himself for Astané and traces on
the same sheet, in his characteristic handwriting (considerably
distorted towards the end): "*Place thy hand on her forehead*," by means
of which he indicates to me that the time has arrived to pass on to the
scene of translation by Esenale.

We may conclude from these successive stages that the Martian
handwriting is the result of a slow

</div>

autosuggestion, in which the idea of a special writing instrument, and
its handling, for a long time played the dominant rôle, then was
abandoned, without doubt, as impracticable to realize. The characters
themselves then haunted for several weeks Hélène's visual imagination
before they appeared to her on the cylinders of the three Martians in a
manner sufficiently clear and stable to enable her to copy them and
afterwards to be capable of subduing her graphomotor mechanism. Once
manifested outwardly,

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

these signs, which I have assembled under the form of an alphabet in
[Fig. 24](#img_fig24.md), have not varied for two years.

Moreover, some trifling confusion, of which I shall speak a little
later, shows well that the personality which employs them is not
absolutely separated from that of Hélène, although the latter, in a
waking state, might hold the same relation to Martian which she holds to
Chinese—that is, she knows its general very characteristic aspect, but
is ignorant of the signification of the characters, and would be
incapable of reading it.

Hélène's Martian handwriting is not stereotyped, but presents, according
to circumstances, some variations in form, especially in the size of the
letters.

This may be established by Figs. [21](#img_fig21) to [32](#img_fig32.md),
in which I have reproduced the greater part of the texts obtained by
writing. When the Martian gushes forth in verbo-visual hallucinations,
Hélène transcribes it in strokes of large dimensions, lacking firmness,
full of repetitions (Figs. [21](#img_fig21), [26](#img_fig26.md),
[31](#img_fig31).md), and she always remarks that the original, which is
before her eyes, is much smaller and clearer than her copy. In the texts
which have come automatically from her hand—*i.e.*, supposedly traced by
the Martians themselves—the handwriting is really smaller and more
precise. Here again are some curious differences. Astané has a
calligraphy less voluminous than that of Esenale, and Ramié has a much
finer one than Esenale (Figs. [28](#img_fig28) and [29](#img_fig29).md).

It would be altogether premature for me to launch

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

myself upon the study of Martian graphology, and, therefore, leaving
that line to my successors, I take up the texts which have been
collected in their chronological order.

#### II. THE MARTIAN TEXTS

It is not always easy to represent a language and its pronunciation by
means of the typographical characters of another. Happily the Martian,
in spite of its strange appearance and the fifty millions of leagues
which separate us from the red planet, is in reality so near neighbor to
French that there is scarcely any difficulty in this case.

The dozen written texts <span id="fr_18"></span>[\*](#fn_18.md) which we
possess, and which Mlle. Smith either copied from a verbo-visual
hallucination, or which were traced by her hand in an access of
graphomotor automatism, are readily translated into French, since each
Martian letter has its exact equivalent in the French alphabet. I have
confined myself to placing accents on the vowels (there are none in the
Martian writing), conformably to the pronunciation of Esenale at the
moment of translation. It is only necessary to read the following texts
aloud, articulating them as though they were French, in order to secure
the Martian words almost exactly as they proceed from the mouth of M le.
Smith; I say almost, because there still remains, naturally, in the
speech of Esenale, as in that of every one, a special mannerism

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

of strengthening certain syllables and slurring others—in short, that of
delicate shades of accentuation, which cannot be adequately represented,
and which the hearers did not attempt to take note of at the seances.

In the auditive or vocal texts, those which have not been obtained by
writing, I have adopted the more probable orthography, according to the
pronunciation of Esenale, but (with the exception of words known by
means of the written texts) I naturally cannot guarantee their absolute
correctness.

The manner in which Hélène takes down in pencil the Martian phrases
which strike her ear is not of great assistance to us in that respect,
because, as I have said above ([p. 158](ipm07.htm#page_158).md), she finds
herself at the time of these verbo-auditive hallucinations in the
situation of a person who hears some unknown words, and spells them as
well as she is able, after a quite arbitrary and often faulty fashion.
She writes, for example, "**hezi darri né ciké taisse**," which,
according to the pronunciation of Esenale and other written texts,
should be "**êzi darié siké tés**"; or, again, "**misse messe as si
lé**," instead of "**mis mess ass ilé**." We cannot, therefore, depend
upon the orthography of Hélène, but I have naturally followed it in
every case in which there seemed to be no good reason to depart from it.
In stating that the following texts should be articulated like French,
two remarks must be added: First, the final consonant, very rare in
Martian, is always aspirated; the word **ten** is pronounced as in the
French *gluten;* 

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

**essat**, like *fat;* **ames**, like *aloes;* **mis** and **mess**,
like *lis* (flower), and mess (of an officer), etc. In the second place,
for the different values of the *e* I have adopted the following rule:
the *e* broad is always indicated by the accent grave *è*; the *e*
medium, which is only found at the beginning and in the middle of a
word, is marked with the acute accent *é*; the *e* short, by the acute
accent at the end of a word (or before a final *e* mute), and by the
circumflex at the beginning or in the middle; the *e* mute, or demimute,
remains without accent.

The pronunciation, therefore, will be, for example, the *e*’s of the
Martian words **mété**, **bénézee**, like those of the French words
*été*, *répétée;* **êvé**, like *rêvé*, **tès**, as in *Lutèce*, etc.

There will be found in italics, underneath the Martian texts, their
French equivalents, word for word, as given by Esenale in the manner
described above (see pp.
[166](ipm07.htm#page_166)-[168](ipm07.htm#page_168).md). <span
id="fr_19"></span>[\*](#fn_19.md) I have also indicated the kind of
automatism—auditive, visual, vocal, or graphic—by means of which each
text was obtained, also the date of its appearance, and (in parentheses)
that of the seance, often quite remote, at which it was translated. I
have also added such explanations as seemed to me to be necessary.

Vocal. November 29, 1896 (translated same seance).—Spoken by Esenale and
addressed to Mine. Mirbel, in a scene of incarnation analogous to the
preceding. At the moment of translation., Esenale repeated, very
distinctly, the last words, as follows: "**né ci,** *est près* \["is
near"\], **ten ti vi**, *de toi* ("thee"). This was evidently an error,
since it appears from numerous later texts that est près de toi
corresponds to **né ten ti vi**; it follows that it would be natural to
translate the word **ci** by *là*, *ici*, or *tout*, if these words had
not been differently rendered in other texts. (A confusion of the adverb
*là* with the article *la*, translated by **ci** in [text
2](ipm08.htm#an_text02), might also be suspected..md)

Auditive. December 4, 1896 (translated December 13). Fragment of a long
discourse by Astané to Hélène, during an apparition which she had of him
about nine o'clock in the evening, as she was about to go to bed. This
sentence, which he uttered twice, is the only one which she has been
able to recall with sufficient precision to note down immediately after
the vision. She has the feeling of having understood Astané's whole
discourse while he was delivering it, and thinks she would have been
able to translate it into French, perhaps not word for word, but in its
general sense. She expected to transcribe it the following day, but in
the morning when she awoke she was unable to recall either the words of
Astané or their meaning, not even that of this sentence, written on the
previous evening. Heard again, as the second part of the following text,
in the seance of the 13th of December.

Auditive. December 13, 1896 (translated same

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

seance).—Heard in the far-away voice of Astané, Hélène having all the
while a painful sensation, as though the skin of her face around her
eyes, on the back of her wrists and hands, was being torn off. In the
translation the word *Espénié* remains as it is, being a proper name;
the left index-finger (Leopold) points heavenward, and says that it
might be rendered by *terre*, *planète*, *demeure*.

Auditive. December 15, 1896 (translated January 17, 1897).—Words spoken
by Astané to Hélène in a morning vision. The following fragment of the
letter in which she sent me this text merits being cited as an example
of those quite frequent cases in which Mlle. Smith, without knowing the
exact translation of the foreign words, nevertheless divines their
general signification and comprehends them by their emotional
equivalent. "This morning, at a quarter before six, I saw Astané at the
foot of my bed. The general sense of his language was at that moment
quite clear to my mind, and I give it to you as I understood it—that is,
in as clear a manner as possible, having noted it down afterwards:

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'How much I regret
your not having been born in our world; you would be much happier there,
since everything is much better with us, people as well as things, and I
would be so happy to have you near me.' That is about what it seemed to
me to mean; perhaps some day we may be able to be sure of it."

Auditive and vocal. January 31, 1897 (translated same seance).—Hélène,
in hemisomnambulism, sees Astané, who tells her to repeat his words; she
replies to him: "But speak plainly . . . I will gladly repeat them . . .
but I do not understand very well . . ." Then she pronounces slowly and
very distinctly the foregoing text, in groups of words, separated by a
moment of silence (marked in the text by the sign—). It is remarked that
these groups, with the exception of the sixth, correspond to the
hemistiches of the French translation obtained in the same seance. After
the sixth group Hélène remains silent for a long time, and finally says:
"I cannot understand; " then utters the four last words, which are the
reply of Astané to her objection.

Auditive. February 24, 1897 (translated March 14).—Reclining in her
easy-chair, after the noonday meal, Hélène hears this sentence, while at
the same time she has the vision of a house, constructed by digging into
a Martian mountain, and traversed by a sort of air-shafts, and which
represents Astané's observatory.

Vocal. March 14, 1897 (translated same seance).—From the beginning of
this seance Hélène complained of cold hands, then a great desire to
weep, and of a buzzing in the ears, which kept increasing and in which
she finally heard Astané address to her the Martian words of [text
10](ipm08.htm#an_text10.md). Immediately

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

after she passes into full somnambulism; her respirations, very short
and panting, rise . to three per second, accompanied by synchronous
movements of the left index-finger; then she stops suddenly with a long
expiration, immediately followed by a deep inspiration: then her breast
heaves, her face assumes an expression of suffering, and the left
index-finger announces that it is Esenale (Alexis Mirbel) who is
incarnated. After a series of spasms and hiccoughs, Hélène arises, and,
placing herself behind Mme. Mirbel, takes her neck in her hands, bows
her head upon hers, tenderly pats her cheek, and addresses to her the
words of [text No. 11](ipm08.htm#an_text11) (except the two last words.md).
Then she raises her head, and again, with panting respiration
(accelerated to thirty inspirations in sixteen seconds), walks towards
M. Lemaître (whose pupil Alexis Mirbel had been at the time of his
death). She places her hands upon his shoulders, affectionately grasps
his right hand, and with emotion and continued sobbing addresses to him
the two words i men! After which she goes through the pantomime of
extending her hand to Leopold and of allowing him to conduct her to a
couch, where the translation of texts Nos. [10](ipm08.htm#an_text10.md),
[11](ipm08.htm#an_text11), and [9](ipm08.htm#an_text09.md) is obtained by
the customary process, but not without difficulty.

Auditive. May 23, 1897 (translated same seance).—Shortly after the
beginning of the seance, Hélène, still being awake, has a vision of
Astané, who addresses her in these words, which she repeats slowly and
in a feeble voice. I give the text as it was heard and uniformly noted
by several sitters, both at the moment of its utterance and at its
subsequent translation. Many corrections, however, would be necessary,
in order to make it correspond with the later written texts: **ké nipuné
ani**, *et ne crains pas* ("and I am not afraid," or, "and I do not
fear") should be changed to **kié nipuné ani**, *ne crains pas* (see
[text 17](ipm08.htm#an_text17).md); **sé** or **cé** only stands here for
*et*, which everywhere else is given as **ni**; **viche** is used in
error for **iche** (unless the **v** was added for the sake of euphony,
of which there is no other example) and **tis** for **tiche**.

<span class="small">It is you, oh Astané, I am dying! Astané,

Vocal. Same seance as the preceding text, after which Hélène passes into
full somnambulism, begins to weep, pants, holds her hand on her heart,
and pronounces this sentence, mingling with it the two words *Adèl* and
*yestad*, which are not Martian, but belong to the Oriental cycle; they
also do not appear in the text as it was repeated at the time of its
translation. This intrusion of terms foreign to the Martian dream is
explained by the imminence of a Hindoo scene ready to appear, which
occupied

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

the latter half of the seance in which the Arab servant, Adèl, plays a
leading rôle. The mingling of the two romances is greatly accentuated a
few moments later, in a long discourse, devoid of *r*’s and very rich in
sibilants, and spoken with so great volubility that it was impossible to
gather a single word. At the time of the translation, at the close of
the seance, this tirade was repeated with the same rapidity, preventing
any notation; according to the French translation which followed, it
concerned memories of the life of Simandini which Hélène recalled to
Astané and in which there is much mention of the aforesaid Adèl (see
Hindoo Cycle, Chap. VII.).

Auditive. June 18, 1897 (translated June 20).—During a visit I made to
Mlle. Smith she has a vision of two Martian personages walking on the
shore of a lake, and she repeats this fragment of their conversation
which she has heard. According to another text ([No.
20](ipm08.htm#an_text20).md), Arva is the Martian name of the sun.

Auditive. June 27, 1897 (translated same seance).—Mme. Mirbel being
present, Hélène perceives Esenale, who remains in the vicinity of his
mother and addresses these words to her. The "adieux" at the close were
not spoken at that time, but were uttered by Esenale immediately
following and as a complement of the translation; this is the only case
(outside of [text 36](ipm08.htm#an_text36).md) in which he did not confine
himself strictly to the texts already gathered and in which he permitted
himself to introduce a new phrase, which otherwise does not contain a
single unknown word; **itatinée**, *chérie*, is evidently a slip which
should be corrected either to **tatinée**, *chérie*, or to **it
atinée**, *ô chérie*. The precise French equivalent of **triménêni** is
probably *entretenions*.

increasing somnambulism, she finally takes the pencil between her index
and middle fingers, tells Esenale that she still sees him and makes him
sit down by her side, and then begins to write, completely absent and
fascinated by the paper. The left index-finger (Leopold) informs us that
it is Esenale himself who is writing by means of Hélène's arm. Twice she
interrupts herself in order to say to Esenale, "Oh! do not go yet, stay
a little while longer!" She appears nervous and agitated, and often
stops writing to stab her paper with her pencil or to make erasures or
scribble on it (see [Fig. 25](#img_fig25).md); in the **zé** of the last
line, she forgets the **é** (this did not prevent Esenale from
pronouncing the word correctly at the time of its translation).

Graphic, then Auditive. October 24, 1897 (there has never been any
translation of this text, two words of which are still unknown).—Hélène
first sees the table illumined by a green light in which

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

some designs appear which she copies, and which give this text, except
the two last letters of the first word, the place of which remains
blank. Immediately after she hears Martian spoken, which she repeats. It
is the same text; then she has a vision of Astané, Esenale, and a little
girl whose name she hears as Niké; but this soon gives way to other
non-Martian somnambulisms. (See [Fig. 25](#img_fig25)..md)

Auditive, then Graphic. November 28, 1897 (translated same
seance).—Fragments of conversation heard during the vision of the
Martian *fête* described on [p. 185](ipm07.htm#page_185.md). Siké (a young
man) and Matêmi (a young girl) form the first couple who pass by and
walk off in the direction of a large bush with red flowers
(**tamèche**); then a second couple exchange the last words of the text
while going to rejoin the

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

first. After this vision, which she contemplated standing and described
with much animation, Hélène seated herself and began to write the same
Martian phrases. It is ascertained from Leopold that it was Astané who
held her hand (in holding the pencil between the thumb and the
index-finger—that is, after the manner of Leopold and not that of Hélène
as she had held it in writing text [No. 17](ipm08.htm#an_text17).md). The
writing being finished, Leopold directs that Hélène shall be made to
seat herself on the couch for the scene of translation.

Auditive. About January 25, 1898 (translated February 13).—Vision, at
six o'clock in the morning, of a young Martian girl (Matêmi?) traversing
a tunnel through a mountain and arriving at the house of Astané, to whom
she addresses this utterance, followed by many others which Hélène could
not grasp with sufficient distinctness to note them down.

Auditive. February 20, 1.898 (translated same seance).—Very complicated
Martian vision. First, three small, movable houses, like pavilions or
Chinese kiosks, going about on little balls; in one of these, two
unknown personages, one of whom puts her hand out of a small oval
window, which occasions, on the part of her companion, the observation
of the first sentence (A) of the text; at this instant, in fact, these
rolling pavilions (**miza**) assume an oscillatory movement, which makes
a noise like "tick-tack," and then glide like a train upon rails. They
go around a high red mountain and come into a sort of magnificent gorge
or ravine, with slopes covered with extraordinary plants, and where they
find white houses on an iron framework resembling piles. The two men
then alight from their "**miza**," chatting together, but Hélène can
only hear

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

fragments (B) of their conversation. A young man of sixteen to eighteen
years of age comes to meet them, who has his head tied up in a kind of
nightcap, and having no hair on the left side. Martian salutations are
exchanged; they mutually strike their heads with their hands, etc.
Hélène complains of hearing very confusedly that which they are saying,
and can only repeat ends of sentences (C). She has pain in her heart,
and Leopold dictates to me by the left index-finger, "*Put her to
sleep*," which presently leads to the customary scene of translation of
the text.

Auditive. March 11, 1898 (translated August 21).—"Yesterday morning, on
jumping out of bed," wrote Hélène to me, when sending me this text, "I
had a vision of Mars, almost the same as that which I had before (at the
seance of February 20). I saw again the rolling pavilions, the houses on
piling, several personages, among them a young man who had no hair on
one side of his head. I was able to note some words. It was very
confused, and the last words were caught on the wing, when here and
there something a little clear came to me . . ."

Auditive. August 21, 1898 (translated same seance).—Waking vision of a
river between two rose-colored mountains, with a bridge (like that in
[Fig. 9](ipm07.htm#img_fig09).md) which lowered itself into the water and
disappeared in order to allow five or six boats to pass (like that in
[Fig. 13](ipm07.htm#img_fig13).md), then reappeared and was restored to its
place. As Hélène describes all this, she hears a voice speaking to her
the above Martian words of the text.

Visual. August 21, 1898 (translated same seance).—Following the
preceding scene: Hélène perceives "in the air" (illumined and red—that
of her Martian vision) some characters unknown to her, which she copies
(see [Fig. 26](#img_fig26).md). I ask her, showing her the word **zé**
(which elsewhere always stands for *le*), if she is not mistaken. She
verifies it by comparing it with the imaginary model before her and
affirms it to be correct.

reunite himself to us, to live of our happiness!—Matêmi faithful, my
heart is faithful!—Siké, this boat which the wind brings near with
force! it has some difficulty in reaching us; the current is strong

Auditive. About the 4th of September, 1898 (translated October
16).—Hélène heard and noted this phrase at the same time at which she
had the vision of the two young Martian people who were walking in a
kind of flower-garden, and saw a boat arrive, like that in [Fig.
13](ipm07.htm#img_fig13.md). The meaning of **chodé** has not been
ascertained.

happy to-day.</span>

Visual. October 3, 1898 (translated October 16).—At a quarter before
nine in the evening Mlle. Smith, desiring to obtain a communication from
Leopold for herself and her mother, sat down in an easy-chair and gave
herself up to meditation. Presently she hears the voice of Leopold
telling her that he cannot manifest himself that evening, but that
something much more interesting and important

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

is being made ready. The room seems to her to become completely
obscured, except the end of the table at which she is sitting, which is
illumined with a golden light. A young Martian girl in a yellow robe and
with long tresses then comes and seats herself beside her and begins to
trace, without ink or paper, but with a point on the end of her
index-finger, black figures on a white cylinder, at first placed on the
table, afterwards on her knees, and which is unrolled as she writes.
Hélène is near enough to see the characters clearly, and copies them in
pencil on a sheet of paper (see [Fig. 27](#img_fig27).md), after which the
vision vanishes and her mother and the room reappear.

Auditive. October 14, 1898 (translated October 16).—Morning vision of an
unknown gentleman and lady, the latter having her arm, spotted with red,
applied to an instrument with three tubes placed on a shelf fastened to
the wall. These words were spoken by the man; the lady said nothing.

six in the morning; vision of a pebbly shore; earth of a red tint;
immense sheet of water, of a bluish green. Two women are walking side by
side. This was all I could gather of their conversation."

vision, but a severe cramp in the right arm and a strong impulse to take
pencil and paper. I write, I know not why." (It is seen by the
translation given two months later that the text refers to the first
manifestation of Ramié and is an announcement of the ultra-Martian
vision which came a few days later.) See [Fig. 28](#img_fig28.md). The term
**vadazas**, which has never been explained, has not a Martian
appearance, and appears to have been borrowed from the Hindoo cycle. As
to *Espénié*, see text [No. 6](ipm08.htm#an_text06.md).

Auditive. November 2, 1898 (translated December 18).—Hélène has a
morning vision of a Martian (Ramié) who encircles her waist with one arm
and with the other shows her, while speaking these words, a strange
tableau (**tapié**) containing extraordinary beings speaking the unknown
language of the following text. At the moment the vision is effaced
Hélène writes, without perceiving that she has done so, text [No.
34](ipm08.htm#an_text34.md). (For further details, see the following
chapter on the Ultra-Martian.)

after, Astané yielded his place to Esenale, who in turn repeated the
Martian phrase, translating it word for word into French by the
customary process.

Graphic. November 2, 1898 (translated December 18).—Hélène only
perceived after its accomplishment that her hand, which she felt "firmly
held," had written this text at the close of the preceding vision (see

Auditive. December 5, 1898 (translated December 18).—Working by
lamp-light at seven o'clock in the morning, Hélène again had a vision of
the Martian (Ramié) who had clasped her waist with one arm while showing
her something with a gesture of the other (probably the tableau of the
preceding vision, though Hélène did not see it) and uttering the first
phrase of it (A). The second phrase (B) is the reply of this same
Martian to a mental question of Hélène asking him to translate the
strange language of the other day. (She trust, therefore, have
understood the meaning of the first phrase in order to have replied to
it by her appropriate mental question.)

Auditive. March 8, 1899 (translated June 4).—Hélène heard the phrase (A)
during the vision of which the description follows. At the translation,
as the sitters did not at once understand that the three first words are
proper names, Esenale adds the phrase (B) with its French signification.
"I was unable to go to sleep yesterday evening. At half-past eleven
everything around me was suddenly lighted up, and the vivid light
permitted me to distinguish surrounding

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

objects. I arose this morning with a very clear remembrance of that
which I then saw. A tableau was formed in that light, and I had more
before me than the interior of a Martian house—an immense square hall,
around which shelves were fastened, or rather little tables suspended
and fastened to the wall. Each of these tables contained a baby, but not
at all bundled up; all the movements of these little infants were free,
and a simple linen cloth was thrown round the body. They might

be said to be lying on yellow moss. I could not say with what the tables
were covered. Some men with strange beasts were circulating round the
hall; these beasts had large flat heads, almost without hair, and large,
very soft eyes, like those of seals; their bodies, slightly hairy,
resembled somewhat those of roes in our country, except for their large
and flat tails; they had large udders, to which the men present fitted a
square instrument with a tube, which was offered to each infant, who was
thus fed

with the milk of these beasts. I heard cries, a great hurly-burly, and
it was with difficulty that I could note these few words \[of this

gradually disappeared, and in a minute after I was in a sound sleep."

He spoke to me, but I could not understand him. I took this sheet of
paper and a pencil; he spoke to me no more, but seized my hand which
held the pencil. I wrote under this pressure; I understood nothing, for
this is as Hebrew to me. My hand was released; I raised my head to see
Astané, but he had disappeared" (see [Fig. 30](#img_fig30).md).

Visual. March 30, 1899 (translated June 4).—Seated at her toilet-table,
at half-past nine o'clock in the evening, Hélène found herself suddenly
enveloped in a rose-colored fog, which hid one part of the furniture
from her, then was dissipated, allowing

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

her to see, at the farther end of her room, "a strange hall, lighted
with rose-colored globes fastened to the wall." Nearer to her appeared a
table suspended in the air, and a man in Martian costume, who wrote with
a kind of nail fastened to his right index-finger. "I lean towards this
man; I wish to place my left hand on this imaginary table, but my hand
falls into empty space, and I have great difficulty in restoring it to
its normal position. It was stiff, and for some moments felt very weak."
Happily the idea occurred to her to take pencil and paper and copy "the
characters which the Martian, whom I had seen several times before
\[Ramié\], traced; and with extreme difficulty—since they were much
smaller than mine—I succeeded in reproducing them" (the Martian text of
[Fig. 31](#img_fig31).md). All this lasted about a quarter of an hour. I

Auditive. June 4, 1899 (translated same seance).Hemisomnambulism, in
which Hélène, without having a vision, hears a voice addressing words to
her, from which, with some difficulty, she collected the preceding
sentences.

41\. To these texts, forming sentences, in order to complete the whole,
some isolated words must be added, gathered on various occasions, the
meaning of which is obtained with sufficient certainty, either from the
French context in which they were framed,

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

or from Hélène's description of the objects which they designated These
words are **chèke**, *papier* ("paper"); **chinit**, *bague* ("ring");
**asnète**, *espèce de paravent* ("kind of screen"). **Anini Nikaîné**,
proper name of a little girl (see [p. 176](ipm07.htm#page_176).md),
probably the Martian sister of Esenale, who floats beside her, invisible
to her, and watches over her during an illness, after the fashion of
spirit protectors. **Béniel**, proper name of our earth, as seen from
Mars (which is called **Durée** in texts 7 and 9).

#### III. REMARKS ON THE MARTIAN LANGUAGE

Provided the reader has given some attention to the foregoing texts, if
only to the two first, he undoubtedly will have been easily satisfied as
to the pretended language of the planet Mars, and perhaps will be
astonished that I have spent so much time upon it. But, as many of the
*habitués* of the seances of Mlle. Smith—and, naturally, Mlle. Smith
herself—hold seriously to its authenticity, I cannot absolve myself from
stating why the "Martian" is, in my opinion, only an infantile travesty
of French. Even in default of the astronomical importance which is
claimed for it on the authority of Leopold, this idiom preserves all the
psychological interest which attaches to automatic products of
subconscious activities of the mind, and it well deserves some minutes
of examination.

It is necessary at the start to render this justice to the Martian (I
continue to designate it by that name, for the sake of
convenience)—namely, that it is, indeed,

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

a language and not a simple jargon or gibberish of vocal noises produced
at the hazard of the moment without any stability. It cannot be denied
the following characteristics—First: It is a harmony of clearly
articulated sounds, grouped so as to form words. Secondly: These words
when pronounced express definite ideas. Thirdly, and finally: Connection
of the words with the ideas is continuous; or, to put it differently,
the signification of the Martian terms is permanent and is maintained
(apart from slight inconsistencies, to which I will return later on)
from one end to the other of the texts which have been collected in the
course of these three years. <span id="fr_20"></span>[\*](#fn_20.md) I will
add that in speaking fluently and somewhat quickly, as Hélène sometimes
does in somnambulism (texts [4](ipm08.htm#an_text04.md),
[11](ipm08.htm#an_text11), [15](ipm08.htm#an_text15), etc..md), it has an
acoustic quality altogether its own, due to the predominance of certain
sounds, and has a peculiar intonation difficult to describe. Just as one
distinguishes by ear foreign languages which one does not understand,
the whole dialect possessing a peculiar accent which causes it to be
recognized, so in this case one perceives, from the first syllables
uttered,

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

whether Hélène is speaking Hindoo or Martian, according to the musical
connection, the rhythm, the choice of consonants and vowels belonging to
each of the two idioms. In this the Martian, indeed, bears the stamp of
a natural language. It is not the result of a purely intellectual
calculation, but influences of an æsthetic order, emotional factors,
have combined in its creation and instinctively directed the choice of
its assonances and favorite terminations. The Martian language has
certainly not been fabricated in cold blood during the normal, habitual,
French (so to speak) state of Mlle. Smith, but it bears in its
characteristic tonalities the imprint of a peculiar emotional
disposition, of a fixed humor or psychical Orientation, of a special
condition of mind, which may be called, in one word, the *Martian* state
of Hélène. The secondary personality, which takes pleasure in linguistic
games, seems, indeed, to be the same, at its source, as that which
delights in the exotic and highly colored visual images of the planet of
red rocks, and which animates the personages of the Martian romance.

A glance at the *ensemble* of the foregoing texts shows that Martian, as
compared with French, is characterized by a superabundance of *é*, *ê*,
and *i*’s, and a scarcity of diphthongs and the nasal sounds. A more
accurate statistical table of sounded vowels which strike the ear in
reading aloud the Martian texts on the one hand, and their translation
into French on the other, gives me the percentages of Table I., which
follows. But it is well known that the vowels are distinguished, from
the acoustic point

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

of view, by certain fixed characteristic sounds, and that they are
distributed at different heights in the musical scale.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *i* and *é* are
the highest, *a* and *o* occupy the middle place, *u* and *ou* are found
in the lower part of the scale. In adding to the latter, therefore, the
nasals, which are always hollow, and also *e* mute, Table I. divides
itself into the three groups of Table II. from the point of view of
height and sonorousness. It is, therefore, clear that the Martian is of
a general tonality much higher than the French; since, while the two
languages have almost the same proportion of middle vowels, the low,
hollow, or mute sounds, which constitute almost one-half of the French
vowels, amount to scarcely one-twelfth in Martian,

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

in which the high sounds, on the contrary, represent in bulk
three-quarters of the vowels, against one-third only in the French. On
the other hand, researches in the field of colored audition have
demonstrated that a close psychological connection exists, based on
certain emotional analogies and an equivalence of organic reactions,
between the high sounds and the bright or vivid colors, and the low or
hollow sounds and the sombre colors. But this same correlation is found
in the somnambulistic life of Mlle. Smith, between the brilliant,
luminous, highly colored visions which characterize her Martian cycle
and the language of the high and sonorous vowels which gushes forth in
the same cycle. It is allowable to conclude from this that it is really
the same emotional atmosphere which bathes and envelops these varied
psychological products, the same personality which gives birth to these
visual and phonetic automatisms. The imagination cannot, however, as is
easily understood, create its fiction out of nothing; it is obliged to
borrow its materials from individual experience. The Martian tableaux
are, therefore, only a reflection. of the terrestrial world, but of that
part of it which possesses the most warmth and brilliancy—the Orient; in
the same way, the Martian language is only French metamorphosed and
carried to a higher diapason.

I admit, then, that Martian is a language, and a natural language, in
the sense that it is automatically brought forth in the emotional state,
or by the secondary personality, which is the source of all the
remainder of the cycle without the conscious participation

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

of Mlle. Smith. It remains for me now to mention some of the
characteristics which seem to indicate that the inventor of this
subliminal linguistic work had never known any idiom other than French,
that it is much more sensible to verbal expression than to logical
connection of ideas, and that it possesses in an eminent degree that
infantile and puerile character which I have already pointed out in the
author of the Martian romance. It now becomes necessary to examine
rapidly this unknown language, from the point of view of its phonetics
and its writing, its grammatical form, its syntax, and its vocabulary.

1\. *Martian Phonetics and Handwriting*.—Martian is composed of
articulate sounds, all of which, consonants as well as vowels, exist in
French. While on this globe languages geographically our neighbors (not
to mention those farther away) differ each from the other by certain
special sounds—*ch*, German, *th*, English, etc.—the language of the
planet Mars does not permit of similar phonetic originalities. It seems,
on the contrary, poorer in this respect than the French. As yet I have
not found in it the hissing *j* or *ge* (as in *juger*), nor the double
sound *x*. Martian phonetics, in a word, are only an incomplete
reproduction of French phonetics.

The Martian alphabet, compared with ours, suggests a remarkable analogy.
The graphic form of the characters is certainly novel, and no one would
divine our letters in these designs of exotic aspect. Nevertheless, each
Martian sign (with the single exception of that of the plural)
corresponds to a

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> French sign,
although the inverse is not the case, which indicates that here again we
are in the presence of a feeble imitation of our system of handwriting.

The twelve written texts upon which I base my comparison comprise about
300 words (of which 160 are different) and 1200 signs. There are
altogether twenty-one different letters, all of which have their exact
equivalents in the French alphabet, which also has five others which
Martian lacks; *j* and *x*, of which the sounds themselves have not been
observed, and *q*, *w*, and *y*, of which there is a double use, with
*k*, *v*, and *i*. This reduction of graphic material manifests itself
in two other details. First, there are neither accents nor punctuation
marks, with the exception of a certain sign, resembling the French
circumflex, used sometimes in the shape of a point at the end of
phrases. In the second place, each letter has only one form, the
diversity of capitals and small letters not seeming to exist in Martian.
Of ciphers we know nothing.

There are still three small peculiarities to notice:

1\. In default of capitals, the initials of proper names are often
distinguished by a point placed above the ordinary character.

2\. In the case of double letters the second is replaced by a point
situated at the right of the first.

3\. Finally, there exists, in order to designate the plural of
substantives and of some adjectives, a special graphic sign, answering
to nothing in the pronunciation and having the form of a small vertical
undulation, which reminds one a little of an amplification of

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

the French s, the usual mark of the plural in French. These
peculiarities, outside the ordinary form of the letters, constitute the
sum total of ingenuity displayed in Martian handwriting.

It must be added that this handwriting, which is not ordinarily
inclined, goes from left to right, like the French. All the letters are
of nearly the same height, except that the i is much smaller, and that
they remain isolated from each other; their assembly into words and
phrases offers to the eye a certain aspect of Oriental hieroglyphic
inscriptions.

The Martian alphabet never having been revealed as such, we are ignorant
of the order in which the letters follow each other. It would seem as
though the letters had been invented by following the French alphabet,
at least in great part, if one may judge according to the analogies of
form of the Martian characters corresponding to certain series of French
letters: compare *a* and *b;* *g* and *h;* *s* and *t;* and also the
succession *k*, *l*, *m*, *n*.

It is in the phonetic value of the letters—that is to say, in the
correspondence of the articulated sounds with the graphic signs—that the
essentially French nature of the Martian may be seen. The only notable
difference to be pointed out here between the two languages is the much
greater simplicity of the Martian orthography, resulting in the
employment of no useless letters. All are pronounced, even the final
consonants, such as *s*, *n*, *z*, etc., which are generally silent in
French. This gives the impression that the Martian handwriting is
moulded on the spoken language, and is only the notation of the
articulated sounds

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

of the latter by the most economical means. In so far it realizes the
type of a handwriting truly phonetic—that is to say, where each sign
corresponds to a certain elementary articulation, constant and
invariable, and vice versa. It is full, on the other hand, of
equivocations, of exceptions, of irregularities, which make one and the
same letter to have very different pronunciations, according to
circumstances, and, reciprocally, which causes the same sound to be
written in different ways without our being able to perceive any
rational explanation for all these ambiguities—were it not for the fact
that the very same thing is to be found in French!

Martian is only disguised French. I will mention only the most curious
and striking coincidences, all the more striking from the fact that the
field from which I have collected them is very limited, being confined
to the dozen texts written and pronounced, which contain only 160
different words.

The simple vowels of the Martian alphabet correspond exactly to the five
French vowels, *a*, *e*, *i*, *o*, *u*, and have the same shades of
pronunciation.

The Martian *c* plays the triple part which it also fulfils in French.
The *s* has the same capricious character as in our language. It is
generally hard, but between two vowels it becomes soft, like *z*.

2\. *Grammatical Forms*.—The *ensemble* of the texts which we possess
does not as yet permit us to make a Martian grammar. Certain
indications, however, warrant the prediction that the rules of that
grammar, if it ever sees the light of day, will be only the counterpart
of, or a parody upon, those of French.

There are some texts where the feminine is derived from the masculine by
the addition of an *e* mute, and the plural by the small, unpronounced
sign, which has all the appearance of being a reminiscence of French
*s*.

Between these two languages there is another order of points of contact,
of a more special interest, because it shows the preponderating rôle
which verbal images have often played in the making of Martian to the
prejudice of the intrinsic, logical nature of the ideas. I should say
that at all times the Martian translates the French word, allowing
itself to be guided by auditive analogies without regard to the real
meaning, in such a way that we are surprised to discover in the idiom of
the planet Mars the same peculiarities of homonyms as in French. It is
also the case that two vocables identical as to pronunciation, but of
entirely heterogeneous signification, as the preposition *à* and the *a*
of the verb *avoir*, are rendered in Martian by the same word, *é*.

Other curious coincidences are to be noted. In

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> French the
conjunction *et* only slightly differs, from the point of view of phonic
images, from the verb *est;* in Martian also there is a great analogy
between **ni** and **né**, which translate these two words. Between the
past participle **nié** of the verb *to be* and the conjunction **ni**
there is only the difference of an *é*, just as between their French
equivalents *été* and *et*.

It must be admitted that all these coincidences would be very
extraordinary if they were purely fortuitous.

3\. *Construction and Syntax*.—The order of the words is absolutely the
same in Martian as in French. This identity of construction of phrases
is pursued sometimes into the minutest details, such as the division or
amputation of the negation *ne . . . pas* (texts
[15](ipm08.htm#an_text15) and [17](ipm08.htm#an_text17).md), and also the
introduction of a useless letter in Martian to correspond to a French
euphemistic *t* (see [text 15](ipm08.htm#an_text15).md), **Kèvi bérimir m
hed**, *quand reviendra-t-il?* ("when will he return?")

If it is admitted hypothetically that the succession of words, such as
is given us in these texts, is not the natural ordering of the Martian
language, but an artificial arrangement, like that of juxtalinear
translations for the use of pupils, the very possibility of that
correspondence absolutely word for word would remain an extraordinary
fact without a parallel, since there is not a single language that I
know of in which each term of the French phrase is always rendered by
*one* term, neither more nor less, of the foreign phrase. The hypothesis
referred to is, moreover, inadmissible, since the Martian texts, of
which Esenale gives the literal translation, were not previously

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

arranged by him with that end in view; they are the identical words
which Mlle. Smith heard and noted in her visions, often weeks and months
before Esenale repeats them for the purpose of translating them, and
which constitute the conversation, as such, taken from life, of the
Martian personages. We must conclude from this that these in their
elocution follow step by step and word by word the order of the French
language, which amounts almost to saying that they speak a French the
sounds of which have simply been changed.

4\. *Vocabulary*.—From an etymological point of view, I have not been
able to distinguish any rule of derivation, even partial, that would
permit the suspicion that the Martian words had come from French words,
according to some law. Apart from the entire first text, where it is
difficult to deny that the people of Mars have stolen French terms of
politeness, at the same time distorting them, no clear resemblance is to
be seen between Martian words and the French equivalents; at most, there
are traces of borrowing, like **merve**, *superbe*, which might have
been abridged from *merveille* ([text 25](ipm08.htm#an_text25).md), and
**vechi**, an imitation of voir.

Still less does the Martian lexicon betray the influence of other known
languages (at least to my knowledge). A term which suggests such
similarity is hardly ever met with—*e.g.*, **modé**, *mère* ("mother"),
and **gudé** *bon* ("good"), cause us to think of German or English
words; **animina** ("existence") is like *anima;* various forms of the
verbs *être* and *vivre* ("to be" and "to live"), **êvé**, **évaï**,
**essat**, recall

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

the Latin *esse* or the Hebrew *évé*, and that passage of the Biblical
story of the Creation where Eve is called the mother of all living
beings. A linguist who happened to be at the same time a savant and a
humorist would doubtless succeed in lengthening this list of
etymologies, after the mode of the eighteenth century. But, *cui bono?*
In that rarity of points of contact between the idioms of our
terrestrial sphere and the Martian glossary, an argument might be found
in favor of the extra-terrestrial origin of the latter, if, on the other
hand, it did not seem to betray the influence of the French language
from the fact that a notable proportion of its words reproduce in a
suspicious manner the same number of syllables or letters as their
French equivalents; note, for example, besides the terms of politeness
already mentioned, the words **tarvine**, *langage;* **haudan**,
*maison;* **dodé**, *ceci;* **valini**, *visage*, etc., and the great
majority of the little words, such as **cé**, *je;* **ké**, *que;*
**ti**, *de;* **dé**, *tu;* etc.

With the exception of such examples as these, it must be acknowledged
that there is no trace of parentage, filiation, of any resemblance
whatever between the Martian and French vocabularies, which forms a
singular contrast to the close identity which we have established
between the two languages in the preceding paragraphs.

This apparent contradiction carries its explanation in itself, and gives
us the key to Martian. This fantastic idiom is evidently the naïve and
somewhat puerile work of an infantile imagination, to which occurred the
idea of creating a new language,

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

and which, while giving to its lucubrations certain strange and unknown
appearances, without doubt caused them to run in the accustomed moulds
of the only real language of which it had cognizance. The Martian of
Mlle. Smith, in other words, is the product of a brain or a personality
which certainly has taste and aptitude for linguistic exercises, but
which never knew that French takes little heed of the logical connection
of ideas, and did not take the trouble to make innovations in the matter
of phonetics, of grammar, or of syntax.

The process of creation of Martian seems to have consisted in simply
taking certain French phrases as such and replacing each word by some
other chosen at random. That is why, especially in the texts at the
beginning, the structure of French words is recognized under the
Martian. The author herself was undoubtedly struck by it, and from that
time exerted herself to complicate her lexicon, to render her words more
and more unrecognizable.

This research of originality—which, however, she has never extended
beyond the purely material part of the language, never having an idea
that there might be other differences in languages—represents an effort
of imagination with which she must be credited. Homage must also be
rendered to the labor of memorizing, which the making of a dictionary
has necessitated. She has sometimes, indeed, fallen into errors; the
stability of her vocabulary has not always been perfect. But, finally,
after the first hesitation and independently of some later confusions,
it gives evidence of a praiseworthy

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

terminological consistency, and which no doubt in time, and with some
suggestive encouragement, would result in the elaboration of a very
complete language—perhaps even of several languages, as we may augur
from text 33, to which we shall return in the following chapter.

5\. *Style*.—It remains to investigate the style. If it is true that
"manners make the man"—that is to say, not the impersonal and abstract
understanding, but the concrete character, the individual temperament,
the humor and emotional vibration—we ought to expect to find in the
style of the Martian texts the same special stamp which distinguishes
the visions, the sound of the language, the handwriting, the
personages—in short, the entire romance, that is to say, the curious
mixture of Oriental exoticism and of childish puerility of which the
secondary personality of Mlle. Smith, at work in this cycle, seems to be
composed. It is difficult to pronounce upon these matters of vague
æsthetic impression rather than of precise observation; but, as well as
I can judge, there seems to me to be in the phraseology of the texts
collected an indefinable something which corresponds well with the
general character of the entire dream. As these words are evidently
first thought in French—then travesties in Martian by a substitution of
sounds, the choice of which, as has been seen, apropos of the high
tonality of this language, reflects the general emotional disposition—it
is, naturally, under their French aspect that we ought to consider them
in judging of their actual style. Unfortunately, we do not know how far
the

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

translation given by Esenale is identical with the primitive original;
certain details seem to hint that there are divergences sometimes.
However that may be, it is clearly to be perceived that the literary
form of the majority of the texts (taken in French) is more akin to
poetry than to prose. While no one of them is in verse, properly
speaking, the large number of hemistiches which are met with, the
frequency of inversion, the choice of terms, the abundance of
exclamations and of broken phrases, betray a great intensity of
sentimental and poetic emotion. The same character is found, with a
strong shade of exotic and archaic originality, in the formulas of
salutation and farewell ("be happy to-day," "three adieux to thee,"
etc.), as well as in many expressions and terms of phrases which rather
recall the obscure and metaphorical parlance of the Orient than the dry
precision of our language of to-day ("*il garde un peu de ton être; cet
élément mystérieux, immense*," etc.)

If, now, it is recollected that everywhere in literary history poetry
precedes prose, imagination comes before reason, and the lyric style
before the didactic, a conclusion according with that of the preceding
paragraphs is reached. Which is, that, by its figures and its style, the
Martian language (or the French phrases which serve it for a skeleton)
seems to bring to us the echo of a past age, the reflex of a primitive
state of mind, from which Mlle. Smith to-day finds herself very far
removed in her ordinary and normal states of mind.

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

#### IV. MLLE. SMITH AND THE INVENTOR OF MARTIAN

The preceding analysis of the Martian language furnishes its support to
the considerations which the content of the romance has already
suggested to us in regard to its author ([p. 194](ipm07.htm#page_194).md).
To imagine that by twisting the sounds of French words a new language
capable of standing examination could actually be created, and to wish
to make it pass for that of the planet Mars, would be the climax of
silly fatuity or of imbecility were it not simply a trait of naïve
candor well worthy of the happy age of childhood.

The whole Martian cycle brings us into the presence of an infantine
personality exuberant of imagination, sharing, as to their light, color,
Oriental exoticism, the æsthetic tendencies of the actual normal
personality of Mlle. Smith, but contrasting with it outside its puerile
character in two points to be noted.

First: It takes a special pleasure in linguistic discussions and the
fabrication of unknown idioms, while Hélène has neither taste nor
facility for the study of languages, which she cordially detests and in
which she has never met with success.

Secondly: Notwithstanding this aversion, Hélène possesses a certain
knowledge, either actual or potential, of German—in which her parents
caused her to take lessons for three years—whereas the author of Martian
evidently knows only French. It is, in fact, difficult to believe that,
if that author had only a very

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

slight knowledge of the German language (so different from the French by
the construction of its sentences, pronunciation, its three genders,
etc.), that some reminiscences of it, at least, would not have slipped
into its lucubrations. I infer from this that the Martian secondary
personality which gives evidence of a linguistic activity so fecund, but
so completely subject to the structural forms of the mother-tongue,
represents a former stage, ulterior to the epoch at which Hélène
commenced the study of German.

If one reflects, on the other hand, on the great facility which Mlle.
Smith's father seems to have possessed for languages (see [p.
17](ipm04.htm#page_17).md), the question naturally arises whether in the
Martian we are not in the presence of an awakening and momentary display
of an hereditary faculty, dormant under the normal personality of
Hélène, but which she has not profited from in an effective manner. It
is a fact of common observation that talents and aptitudes often skip a
generation and seem to pass directly from the grandparents to the
grandchildren, forgetting the intermediate link. Who knows whether Mlle.
Smith, some day, having obtained Leopold's consent to her marriage, may
not cause the [polyglot](errata.htm#3.md) aptitudes of her father to bloom
again with greater brilliancy, for the glory of science, in a brilliant
line of philologists and linguists of genius?

Meanwhile, and without even invoking a special latent talent in Hélène's
case, the Martian may be attributed to a survival or a reawakening under
the lash of mediumistic hypnoses of that general function,

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

common to all human beings, which is at the root of language and
manifests itself with the more spontaneity and vigor as we mount higher
towards the birth of peoples and individuals.

Ontogenesis, say the biologists, reproduces in abridged form and
*grosso-modo* phylogenesis; each being passes through stages analogous
to those through which the race itself passes; and it is known that the
first ages of ontogenic evolution—the embryonic period, infancy, early
youth—are more favorable than later periods and adult age to the
ephemeral reappearances of ancestral tendencies, which would hardly
leave any trace upon a being who had already acquired his organic
development. The "poet who died young" in each one of us is only the
most common example of those atavic returns of tendencies and of
emotions which accompanied the beginnings of humanity, and remain the
appanage of infant peoples, and which cause a fount of variable energy
in each individual in the spring-time of his life, to congeal or
disappear sooner or later with the majority; all children are poets, and
that in the original, the most extended, acceptation of the term. They
create, they imagine, they construct—and language is not the least of
their creations.

I conclude from the foregoing that the very fact of the reappearance of
that activity in the Martian states of Hélène is a new indication of the
infantile, primitive nature left behind in some way and long since
passed by her ordinary personality, of the subliminal strata which
mediumistic autohypnotization with her puts in ebullition and causes to
mount

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

to the surface. There is also a perfect accord between the puerile
character of the Martian romance, the poetic and archaic charms of its
style, and the audacious and naïve fabrication of its unknown language.

the Martian lacks the essential character of a language—that is to say,
a practical sanction by use; by the fact of its serving as a means of
communication between living beings—I will not answer, like Mlle. Smith,
that after all we know nothing about that, but will simply say that the
social side of the question does not concern us here. Even if Volapük
and Esperanto are not used, they are none the less languages, and the
Martian has, in regard to its artificial construction, the psychological
superiority of being a natural language, spontaneously created, without
the conscious participation, reflective or willing, of a normal
personality.
