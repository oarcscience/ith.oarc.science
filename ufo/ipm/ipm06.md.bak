### CHAPTER IV

#### THE PERSONALITY OF LEOPOLD

IS Leopold really Joseph Balsamo, as he pretends? Or, since he has
nothing in common with the famous thaumaturgist of the last century,
save a certain superficial resemblance, is he, at any rate, a real
being, separate from, and independent of, Mlle. Smith? Or, finally, is
he only a pseudo-reality, a kind of allotropic modification of Hélène
herself, a product of her subliminal imagination, just like our dream
creations and the rôles suggested to a hypnotic subject?

Of these three suppositions it is the last which to my mind is
undoubtedly the true one, while in Mlle. Smith's eyes it is as certainly
the false view. It would be hard to imagine a more profound difference
of opinion than that which exists between Mlle. Smith and myself on this
subject. It is I, always, who get the worst of a discussion with her
concerning it. I yield for two reasons. First, out of politeness; and,
secondly, because I understand Hélène perfectly, and, putting myself in
her place, realize that I should think exactly as she does about the
matter.

Given her surroundings and personal experiences, it is impossible for
her to do otherwise than believe

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

in the objective distinct existence of that mysterious being who
constantly enters into her life in a sensible and quasi-material way,
leaving her no room to doubt. He presents himself before her endowed
with corporeality like that of other people, and hides objects which are
behind him exactly as an ordinary individual of flesh and bone would do
He talks into her ears, generally into the left, in a characteristic
voice, which appears to come from a variable distance, sometimes about
six feet off, sometimes much farther. He jars the table on which she has
placed her immobile arms, takes hold of her wrist and writes with her
hand, holding the pen in a manner unlike her, and with a handwriting
wholly different from hers. He puts her to sleep without her knowledge,
and she is astonished to learn upon awaking that he has gesticulated
with her arms and spoken through her mouth in the deep bass voice of a
man, with an Italian accent, which has nothing in common with the clear
and beautiful quality of her feminine voice.

Moreover, he is not always on hand. He by no means answers Hélène's
appeals on all occasions; is not at her mercy; far from it. His conduct,
his manifestations, his comings and goings cannot be predicted with any
certainty, and testify to an autonomous being, endowed with free-will,
often otherwise occupied or absent on his own affairs, which do not
permit of his holding himself constantly at the disposal of Mlle. Smith.
Sometimes he remains for weeks without revealing himself, in spite of
her wishing for him and calling upon him. Then, all at once, he makes
his appearance when she least expects him. He

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

speaks for her in a way she would have no idea of doing, he dictates to
her poems of which she would be incapable. He replies to her oral or
mental questions, converses with her, and discusses various questions.
Like a wise friend, a rational mentor, and as one seeing things from a
higher plane, he gives her advice, counsel, orders even sometimes
directly opposite to her wishes and against which she rebels. He
consoles her, exhorts her, soothes, encourages, and reprimands her; he
undertakes against her the defence of persons she does not like, and
pleads the cause of those who are antipathetic to her. In a word, it
would be impossible to imagine a being more independent or more
different from Mlle. Smith herself, having a more personal character, an
individuality more marked, or a more certain actual existence.

Hélène is also fortified in this conviction by the belief not only of
members of her own family, but by that of other cultivated people who,
having attended many of her seances, have no doubt whatever of Leopold's
objective and separate existence. There are those who believe so firmly
in the reality of this superior being, invisible to them, that they are
in the habit of calling upon him during the absence of Mlle. Smith.
Naturally they obtain responses, through the table or otherwise, and
that causes unforeseen complications sometimes when she comes to learn
of it. For while she admits theoretically—and Leopold himself has often
declared the same thing—that he extends his surveillance and protection
from afar over other spiritistic groups, and especially over all
Hélène's friends and acquaintances, in practice and in fact,

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

however, it happens that neither he nor she will willingly admit the
authenticity of those pretended communications from Leopold obtained in
the absence of the medium of his predilection. It is generally some
deceiving spirit who has manifested in his place on these occasions.
These denials, however, do not prevent those who have become believers
from continuing to believe in the omnipresence of this good genius, or
from teaching their children to revere him, to make vows and address
prayers to him. It must not be forgotten that spiritism is a religion.
This also explains the great respect shown to mediums, which is like
that accorded to priests.

It follows that, without in the least refraining from speaking ill of
them whenever they think they have a grievance against them, on the
other hand they bestow on them the same marks of respect as are only
accorded to the most sublime product of the human race.

I have known a *salon* where, on the centre table, in full view and in
the place of honor, were two photographs in beautiful frames: on the one
side the head of Christ, on the other the portrait of—Mlle. Hélène
Smith. Among other believers, with less ideal but more practical
aspirations, no business matter of importance is closed, no serious
decision made, until Leopold has been consulted through Hélène as an
intermediary, and the cases are too numerous to mention in which he has
furnished important information, prevented a heavy precuniary loss,
given an efficacious medical prescription, etc.

It is easily seen how all the successes obtained by

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Leopold, and the
mystical veneration which many very estimable persons accord him, must
contribute to strengthen the faith of Hélène in her all-powerful
protector. It is in vain that, against this absolute assurance, one
seeks to avail one's self of the arguments of contemporary psychology.
The example of the fictions of the dream, the analogies taken from
hypnotism and from psychopathology, considerations of mental
disintegration, the division of the consciousness and the formation of
second personalities, all these refined subtleties of our modern
scientists break in pieces like glass against immovable rock. I shall
not undertake to combat a proposition which, for her, has incontestably
so much evidence in its favor, and which resolves all difficulties in
the most felicitous manner and in conformity to good common-sense.

Nevertheless, since each individual has a right to his own opinion in
the world, I beg leave to assume, for the time being, that Leopold does
not exist outside of Mlle. Smith, and to try to discover his possible
genesis in the mental life of the latter—solely by hypothesis and by
means of psychological experiment. Therefore, readers who have little
taste for this kind of academic composition had better skip this
chapter.

#### I. PSYCHOGENESIS OF LEOPOLD

A description of the development of Leopold is not easy, since he has a
double origin, apparent and real, like the cranial nerves which give so
much trouble to the students of anatomy.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

His apparent origin, or, I should say, the moment when he is outwardly
separated from the personality of Hélène, and manifests as an
independent "spirit," is relatively clear and well marked; but his
actual origin, profoundly enfolded in the most inward strata of Hélène's
personality and inextricably mixed up with them, presents great
obscurities and can only be determined in a very conjectural manner. Let
us begin with the apparent origin, or the first appearance of Leopold at
the seances.

It is easy to understand that, once initiated into spiritism and plunged
into a current of ideas where the comforting doctrine of spirit-guides
and protectors holds an important place, Mlle. Smith did not delay in
coming into possession of, like all good mediums, a disincarnate spirit
specially attached to her person. She even had two in succession, Victor
Hugo and Cagliostro. It is not a question of a simple change of name of
the guide of Hélène, who presented himself first under the aspect and
the name of the great poet and then afterwards adopted that of the
renowned thaumaturgist, but there were, at least at the beginning, two
different personalities, apparently hostile to each other, one of whom
by degrees supplanted the other, after a struggle, a trace of which is
found in the very incomplete reports of the seances of that period.
Three phases can also be distinguished in the psychogenesis of Mlle.
Smith's guide: an initial phase of five months, during which Victor Hugo
reigns alone; a phase of transition of about a year, when the protection
of Victor Hugo is seen to be powerless to protect Hélène

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

and her spiritistic group against the invasion of an intruder called
Leopold, who claims and manifests an increasing authority over the
medium by virtue of mysterious relations in the course of a previous
existence; finally, the present period, which has lasted for six years
past, in which Victor Hugo no longer figures, and which may be dated
approximately from the moment when it was revealed that Leopold is only
an assumed name, under which he hides in reality the great personality
of Joseph Balsamo.

I do not find any fact worthy of mention in the first phase, in which
Victor Hugo, who seems to have appeared as the guide of Mlle. Smith
about the 1st of April, 1892 (see above, [p. 38](ipm05.htm#page_38).md),
played a rôle of no importance. In the second phase, however, it is
necessary to cite some extracts from the reports of the seances of the
N. group, in order to throw light upon the singular character which
Leopold manifested there from the beginning.

August 26, 1892.—"A spirit announces himself under the name of Leopold.
He comes for Mlle. Smith, and seems to wish to have a great authority
over her. She sees him for some moments, he appears to be about
thirty-five years of age, and is clothed altogether in black. The
expression of his countenance is rather pleasing, and through answers to
some questions which we put to him we are given to understand that he
knew her in another existence, and that he does not wish her to give her
heart to any one here below. . . Mlle. Smith recognizes her guide,
Victor Hugo. She is made

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

happy by his arrival, and asks his protection against the obsession of
this new spirit. He answers that she has nothing to fear, that he will
always be present. She is joyful at being guarded and protected by him,
and feels that she has nothing to fear."

September 2.—. . . "Leopold comes also, but Mlle. Smith fears nothing,
since her guide (Victor Hugo) is there to protect her."

September 23.—. . . "An unpleasant evening. A spirit announces himself.
It is Leopold. He speaks to us at once: 'I am here. I wish to be master
of this sitting.' We are very much disappointed, and do not expect any
good of him. He tries, as he had already done once before, to put Mlle.
Smith to sleep, who has great difficulty in struggling against this
sleep. She rises from the table, hoping by this means to rid herself of
him, and that he will give up his place to others. She returns in about
ten minutes, but he is still there, and apparently has no intention of
abandoning his place. We summon our friends (spiritual) to our aid. . .
. They take Leopold's place momentarily, but very soon Leopold returns;
we struggle with him, we desire him to go away, but neither soft nor
hard words have any effect; before that dogged determination we realize
that all our efforts will be useless, and we decide to close the
seance."

October 3.—"\[Manifestation by the favorite spirits of the group, who
declare\] that they have not been able to come, as they would have liked
to do; that they were prevented by the spirit of Leopold,

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

who is trying to introduce himself to us; that we should repulse him as
much as possible, persuaded that he does not come for any good end. I do
not know whether we shall be able to rid ourselves of him, but we
greatly fear that he will injure us and retard our advancement."

October 7.—. . . "Leopold announces himself. We try to reason with him;
we do not wish to forbid his coming, but we ask of him that he shall
come as a friend to all, and not in the rôle of master. He is not
satisfied; appears to bear much malice. We trust he will come to have
better feelings. He shows himself, walks around the table, bows to us,
and salutes each one with his hand, and retires again, leaving his place
to others."

October 14.—"\[After a quarter of an hour of motionless and silent
waiting in darkness around the table Mlle. Smith is questioned, and she
is shaken in vain.\] She is asleep. By the advice of persons present we
allow her to remain asleep, when, at the end of five minutes, the table
raises itself, a spirit announces himself. It is Victor Hugo; we ask if
he has anything to say; he answers yes, and spells out: *Wake her; do
not allow her ever to sleep*. We try to do so. We are nervous about that
sleep; we have great difficulty in awakening her."

January 6, 1893.—"After twenty minutes of waiting, Leopold arrives, and,
as is his habit, puts the medium to sleep for some minutes; he torments
us, and prevents our friends (disincarnate) from coming to the table. He
vexes us in every way, and goes contrary to all our wishes. In presence
of that rancor

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

the sitters regret the indications of ill-humor they have shown towards
him, and deplore having to pay so dear for them. It is with difficulty
that the medium can be awakened."

February, 1893.—"In one of the seances of this month a remarkable thing
happened: the spirit of Leopold, who was very much irritated on that
day, twice in succession took away her chair from our medium and carried
it to the farther end of the room, while Mlle. Smith fell heavily to the
floor. Not expecting this wretched farce, Mlle. Smith struck her knee so
hard that for several days she suffered pain in walking. We were obliged
to terminate the seance; we were not comfortable. Why this animosity?"

This word *animosity* describes very well the conduct and the feelings
that Leopold seemed to have towards the N. group and against his placid
rival, Victor Hugo. The personal recollections of the sitters whom I
have been able to interrogate confirm the substantial physiognomy of the
two figures. That of Hugo is, in effect, effaced and altogether eclipsed
by the totally opposite character of the arrogant Leopold, who takes a
peculiar pleasure in the rôle of vindictive and jealous mischief-maker,
obstructing the appearance of the "spirits" desired by the group,
putting the medium to sleep, or causing her to fall on the floor,
forbidding her to give her heart to another, and breaking up the seances
as far as he is able. It seems to have finally resulted in the meetings
of the N. group coming to an end at the beginning of the summer; then
comes a break of six months, after which I find

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mlle. Smith on the
12th of December inaugurating a new series of seances, with an entirely
different spiritistic group organized by Prof. Cuendet. Here Victor Hugo
very rarely appears, and never in the rôle of guide, which rôle is
freely accorded, without objection, to Leopold, whose real identity
(Cagliostro) was no secret to any one in the new environment. It was,
therefore, in the course of the year 1893, at a period which cannot be
precisely determined from the records, that the rivalry of these two
personalities was terminated by the complete triumph of the second.

It follows from the preceding recital that the appearance of Leopold in
seances of the N. group was a phenomenon of manifest contrast, of
hostility, and of antagonism towards that group.

It is a difficult and delicate task to pronounce upon the complex spirit
of an environment of which one was not a part, and in regard to which
one possesses only a few and not very concordant incidents. The
following, however, seem to be the facts:

The N. group, much more numerous than is convenient in seances of that
kind, was composed of very varied elements. Alongside of serious
believers were ordinarily some students who boarded with one of the
ladies of the group, and who do not appear to have felt the seriousness
of spiritistic reunions.

That age has no mercy, and the profound signification of the seances
often escaped their superficial and frivolous intelligence. Under such
conditions Mlle. Smith was inevitably compelled to experience two
contrary impressions. On the one hand, she perceived

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

herself admired, made much of, fêted, as the unrivalled medium, which
she really was, and upon whom the group depended for its existence; on
the other hand, her secret instincts and high personal dignity could not
but be offended by the familiarities to which she was exposed in this
mixed environment.

I regard the two rival and successive guides of Hélène as the expression
of this double sentiment. If she had been brought up like an American
woman, or if her nature had been a degree less fine, the frivolity of
the seances would undoubtedly have only given more warmth and brilliancy
to Victor Hugo; instead of which, the victorious colors of Leopold are
raised over a nature of great native pride, extremely sensitive on the
point of feminine dignity, and whose severe and rigid education had
already exalted her sense of self-respect. After a struggle of a year
between these two personifications of opposite emotional tendencies, the
second, as we have seen, finally triumphs; and Mlle. Smith withdraws
from the N. group, which at the same time breaks up.

The idea I have formed of Leopold is now apparent. He represents, to my
mind, in Mlle. Smith, the synthesis, the quintessence—and the expansion,
too—of the most hidden springs of the psychological organism. He gushes
forth from that deep and mysterious sphere into which the deepest roots
of our individual existence are plunged, which bind us to the species
itself, and perhaps to the Absolute, and whence confusedly spring our
instincts of physical and moral self-preservation, our sexual feelings.
When Hélène found herself in an environment not exactly dangerous,

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

but where she simply ran the risk, as in the N. group, of yielding to
some inclination contrary to her fundamental aspirations, it is then
that Leopold suddenly springs up, speaking as the master, taking
possession of the medium for himself, and indicating his unwillingness
that she should attach herself to any one here below. We here recognize
the same principle of self-protection and self-preservation which was
already active in her as a young girl in the teleological automatisms
arising on the occasion of certain emotional shocks, of which I have
spoken on [p. 25](ipm04.htm#page_25.md).

But, by these considerations, we have travelled very far from the
original appearance of Leopold in the seance of the 26th of August,
1892, towards his actual, more ancient origin. This seems to date from a
great fright which Hélène had in the course of her tenth year. As she
was walking along the street, on her way home from school, she was
attacked by a big dog. The terror of the poor child can well be
imagined, and from which she was happily delivered by a personage
clothed in a long brown robe with flowing sleeves and with a white cross
on the breast, who, appearing to her suddenly and as by a miracle,
chased the dog away, and disappeared before she had time to thank him.
But, according to Leopold, this personage was no other than himself, who
on this occasion for the first time appeared to Hélène, and saved her by
driving away the dog.

This explanation was given by Leopold on the 6th of October, 1895, in a
seance in which Hélène experienced, in a somnambulistic state, a
repetition of

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

that scene of fright, with heart-rending cries, gestures of struggle and
defence, attempts at flight, etc. In the waking state she very well
recalls this episode of her childhood, but cannot accept Leopold as the
person who came to her rescue, but believes it to have been a priest or
member of some religious order who rushed to her assistance and drove
the animal away. Her parents also recollected the incident, which she
told them one day on returning from school in a very excited state, and
after which she could not for a long time encounter a dog in the street
without hiding herself in the folds of her mother's dress. She has since
always preserved an instinctive aversion towards dogs.

We have seen (p. 31) that after this first incident, matters remained
*in statu quo* for four years, up to the time when the age of puberty
began to favor the development of the Oriental visions. Here, Leopold,
to whom we owe this information, does not altogether agree with himself,
for at one time he says that it was he himself who furnished Mlle. Smith
with her visions of India, at another time he says that they are
reminiscences of one of her former existences.

Alongside of these varied visions, Leopold has clearly appeared under
the form of the protector in the dark robe in a number of cases. I will
only cite two examples, one very remote, the, other quite recent.

One day Hélène went to consult her family physician for some trifling
ailment, who, having known her for a long time and being an old friend
of her family, presumed to give her an innocent kiss. He was quite
unprepared for the explosion of wrath

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

which this familiarity provoked, and hastened to make his apologies: but
what is of interest to us in this connection is the fact that under the
shock of this emotion her defender of the brown robe appeared before her
in the corner of the room, and did not leave her side until she had
reached home.

A short time ago this same protector, always in the same costume,
accompanied her several days in succession while she was traversing a
little-frequented part of the route towards her place of business. One
evening, also, he appeared to her at the entrance to the street leading
to the locality in question, in the attitude of baring the way, and
obliged her to make a detour to regain her house.

Mlle. Smith has the impression—and several indications go to show that
she is not deceived—that it is with the purpose of sparing her some
unpleasant sight or a dangerous encounter that Leopold, in the brown
robe, appears to her under perfectly well-known conditions. He rises
before her always at a distance of about ten yards, walks, or rather
glides, along in silence, at the same rate as she advances towards him,
attracting and fascinating her gaze in such a manner as to prevent her
turning her eyes away from him either to the right or the left, until
she has passed the place of danger. It is to be noted that whereas
Leopold, under other circumstances—for instance, at the seances—shows
himself to her in the most varied costumes and speaks on all subjects,
it is always under his hieratic aspect, silent, and clothed in his long
dark robe, that he appears to her on those occasions of real life in
which she is exposed to feelings of fright peculiar

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

to her sex, as he appeared to her on that first occasion in her tenth
year.

The hints I have given sufficiently justify, I think, my opinion that
the real and primordial origin of Leopold is to be found in that deep
and delicate sphere in which we so often encounter the roots of hypnoid
phenomena, and to which the most illustrious visionaries, such as
Swedenborg, <span id="fr_7"></span>[\*](#fn_7.md) seem to owe a great part
not only of the intellectual content but. of the imaginative form, the
hallucinatory wrapping, of their genius. There is a double problem to be
solved in Mlle. Smith's case. Why have these instinctive feelings and
emotional tendencies which are common to the entire human race succeeded
in developing in her a product so complex and highly organized is is the
personality of Leopold? and why, in the second place, does that
personality believe itself to be Joseph Balsamo?

I instantly reply that these two results are, to my mind, entirely the
effect of autosuggestion. To explain the first, the simple fact of her
being occupied with spiritism and engaged in mediumistic experiments, is
sufficient. Take any individual having in her subconsciousness memories,
scruples, emotional tendencies, put into her head spiritistic leanings,
then seat her at a table, or put a pencil in her hand: even though she
may not be of a very impressionable or suggestible temperament, or
inclined to the mental disintegration which the general

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

public calls the mediumistic faculty, nevertheless, it will not be long
before her subliminal elements group themselves and arrange themselves
according to the "personal" form to which all consciousness tends, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[\*](#fn_8.md) and which discloses itself outwardly by
communications which have the appearance of coming directly from
disincarnate spirits.

In the case of Mlle. Smith, Leopold did not exist under the title of a
distinct secondary personality before Hélène began to be occupied with
spiritism. It was at the seances of the N. group, by an emotional
reaction against certain influences, as we have seen, that he began,
little by little, to take shape, aided by memories of the same general
tone, until he finally grew into an apparently independent being,
revealing himself through the table, manifesting a will and a mind of
his own, recalling analogous former incidents of Hélène's life, and
claiming for himself the merit of having intervened in it in the rôle of
her protector.

Once established, this secondary self could not do otherwise than to
grow, and to develop and strengthen itself in all directions,
assimilating to itself a host of new data favoring the state of
suggestibility which accompanies the exercise of mediumship. Without the
spiritism and the autohypnotization of the seances, Leopold could never
have been truly developed into a personality, but would have continued
to remain in the nebulous, incoherent

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

state of vague subliminal reveries and of occasional automatic
phenomena.

The second problem, that of explaining why this secondary personality,
once established, believes itself to be Cagliostro rather than any other
celebrated personage, or of remaining simply the anonymous guardian
angel of Mlle. Smith, would demand a very complete knowledge of the
thousand outside influences which have surrounded Hélène since the
beginning of her mediumship, and which may have involuntarily influenced
her.

But on this point I have only succeeded in collecting a very few
incidents, which leave much still to be desired, and are of such a
character that it is entirely permissible for any one to claim that the
purely psychological origin of that personality is not clearly
established, and to prefer, if he chooses, the actual intervention of
the disincarnate Joseph Balsamo to my hypothesis of autosuggestion.

The following, however, are the facts advanced by me in support of the
latter:

The authoritative and jealous spirit, the evident enemy of the N. group,
who manifested himself on the 26th of August, 1892, under the name of
Leopold, did not reveal his identity as that of Cagliostro until some
time afterwards, under the following circumstances:

One of the most regular attendants at the reunions of the N. group was a
Mme. B., who had long been an adherent of spiritism, and who had
previously attended numerous seances at the house of M. and Mme. Badel,
a thoroughly convinced couple

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

of amateurs, now deceased, whose salon and round table have held a very
honorable place in the history of Genevese occultism. But I learned from
Mme. B. that one of the disincarnate spirits who manifested himself
oftenest at the seances of M. and Mme. Badel was this very Joseph
Balsamo. There is, indeed, no figure in history which accords better
with the idea of a posthumous return to the mysteries of the round table
than that of the enigmatic Sicilian, especially since Alexandre Dumas,
*père*, has surrounded him with an additional halo of romance.

Not content with the public reunions of the N. group, Mme. B. often
invited Hélène to her house for private seances, of which no record was
made. At one of these, Hélène having had a vision of Leopold, who
pointed out to her with a wand a decanter, Mme. B. suddenly thought of a
celebrated episode in the life of Cagliostro, and after the seance she
proceeded to take from a drawer and show to Hélène an engraving taken
from an illustrated edition of Dumas, representing the famous scene of
the decanter between Balsamo and the Dauphin at the château of Taverney.
At the same time she gave utterance to the idea that the spirit who
manifested himself at the table by means of Hélène's hands was certainly
Joseph Balsamo; and she expressed her astonishment that Hélène had given
him the name of Leopold, to which Helene replied that it was he himself
who had given that name. Mme. B., continuing her deductions, told Mlle.
Smith that perhaps she had formerly been the medium of the great
magician, and consequently had been Lorenza Feliciani in a former life.
Hélène at once accepted the

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

idea, and for several weeks considered herself to be the reincarnation
of Lorenza, until one day a lady of her acquaintance remarked that it
was impossible, Lorenza Feliciani having never existed save in the
imagination and the romances of Alexandre Dumas, *père*. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[\*](#fn_9.md)

Thus dispossessed of her supposed former existence, Hélène was not long
in declaring through the table that she was Marie Antoinette. As to
Leopold, a short time after Mme. B. had hypothetically identified him
with Cagliostro, he himself confirmed that hypothesis at a seance of the
N. group, dictating to the table that his real name was Joseph Balsamo.

The origin of the name of Leopold is very obscure, and many hypotheses
have been advanced to account for it without our being able to establish
any of them with certainty.

One fact, however, is certain, namely, that save for the vague
affirmation that he had known Hélène in a previous existence, Leopold
had never pretended to be Cagliostro, or given any reason for being
thought so, before the reunion where Mme. B., who had been for some time
accustomed to manifestations of that personage, announced the
supposition and showed Mlle. Smith immediately after the seance (at a
moment when she was probably still in a very suggestible state) an
engraving from Dumas’ works representing Balsamo and the Dauphin. From
that day Leopold, on his part, never failed to claim that personality,
and progressively to realize the character of the rôle in a very
remarkable manner, as we shall see.

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

#### II. PERSONIFICATION OF BALSAMO BY LEOPOLD

There is no need, I think, to remind the reader of the well-known
fact—so often described under the names of objectivity of types,
personification, change of personality, etc.—that a hypnotized subject
can be transformed by a word into such other living being as may be
desired, according to the measure in which his suggestibility on the one
hand and the vividness of his imagination and the fulness of his
stored-up knowledge or- memories on the other, enables him to fulfil the
rôle which is imposed upon him. Without investigating here to what
extent mediums may be likened to hypnotized subjects, it is undeniable
that an analogous phenomenon takes place in them; but the process is
more gradual, and may extend itself over several years. In place of the
immediate metamorphosis which modifies at one stroke and instantly,
conformably to a prescribed type, the attitude, the physiognomy, the
gestures, the words, the intonations of voice, the style, the
handwriting, and other functions besides, we are, in the case of the
medium, in the presence of a development formed by successive stages
arranged according to grades, with intervals of different lengths, which
finally succeed in creating a complete personality, all the more
astonishing, at first sight, because the involuntary suggestions have
not been noticed, the accumulations of which have little by little
caused its birth. This process of development

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

is present in a high degree in the case of Mlle. Smith, in the
elaboration of her secondary personality, Leopold-Cagliostro.

In the beginning, in 1892 and 1893, this "spirit" only manifested
himself by the brief periods of sleep which he induced in Hélène at
certain seances, by raps struck upon the table, by visions in which he
showed himself clothed in black and of youthful appearance, and, more
rarely, by auditive hallucinations. His character and the content of his
messages were summed up in imperious, authoritative, domineering
manners, with the pretension of claiming Mlle. Smith all for himself, of
defending her against the influences of the N. group, and, finally, of
detaching her from that environment.

There was nothing, however, in this general character of monopoly and of
protection which specially recalled the Balsamo of history or of
romance. The personification of complete objectivity of this established
type really began only in 1894, when Leopold had no longer to struggle
with an environment foreign to his nature. The subconscious
psychological task of realization of the proposed model could then be
followed by him more freely; in spiritistic terms, Joseph Balsamo was
able to manifest himself and make himself known in a manner more
complete through Hélène as an intermediary, while continuing to follow
and protect her as the reincarnation of the royal object of his passion.

At the seances held with M. Cuendet, Leopold frequently showed himself
to Hélène clothed after the fashion of the last century and with a face
like

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

that of Louis XVI., under the different phases of his multiplex genius.
He also showed himself to her in his laboratory, surrounded by utensils
and instruments appropriate to the sorcerer and alchemist that he was;
or, again, as the physician and possessor of secret elixirs, the
knowledge of which is productive of consultations or remedies for the
use of sitters who need them; or, again, as the illumined theosophist,
the verbose prophet of the brotherhood of man, who diffuses limping
Alexandrine verses—which seem to have been inherited from his
predecessor, Victor Hugo—containing exhortations a little weak at times,
but always stamped with a pure moral tone, elevated and noble
sentiments, and a very touching religious spirit—in short, a fine
example of that "ethico-deific verbiage" (if I may be allowed the
expression, which is an Americanism), which, both in prose and in verse,
is one of the most frequent and estimable products of mediumship.

But it was not until 1895 that Leopold, benefiting by the progress made
by the automatic phenomena in Hélène, multiplied and perfected his
processes of communication. The first step consisted in substituting, in
his dictations by spelling, the movements of the hand or of a single
finger for those of the whole table. This was the immediate result of a
suggestion of mine.

The second step in advance was the handwriting, which shows two stages.
In the first, Leopold gave Hélène the impression of a phrase
(verbo-visual hallucination), which she copied in pencil on a sheet of
paper, in her own handwriting. The second,

</span>

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

which was only accomplished five months later, and which consisted in
writing directly with Hélène's hand, permitted the immediate
establishment of three curious facts. One is, that Leopold holds his pen
in the usual manner, the handle resting between the thumb and the
index-finger, while Hélène, in writing, always holds her pen-handle or
pencil between the index and middle fingers, a very rare habit with us.
The next is that Leopold has an entirely different handwriting from that
of Hélène, a calligraphy more regular, larger, more painstaking, and
with marked differences in the formation of the letters (see Figs.
[3](#img_fig03) and [4](#img_fig04).md). The third is that he uses the
style of handwriting of the last century, and puts an *o* instead of an
*a* in the tenses of the verbs, *j’amois*, for *j’amais*, etc. These
three characteristics he has never departed from during all the four
years that I have been accumulating specimens of his handwriting.

The following is a résumé of the seances at which these two innovations
took place.

April 21, 1895.—As I had just asked Leopold a question which he did not
like, Hélène, being in a state of hemisomnambulism, with a pencil and
some sheets of paper placed before her, in the hope of obtaining some
communication (not from Leopold), seemed about to plunge into a very
interesting perusal of one of the blank sheets; then, at my request,
which she with difficulty comprehended, she commenced to write rapidly
and nervously on another sheet, in her usual handwriting, a copy of the
imaginary text which Leopold was showing her ("in

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

fluid letters," as he said afterwards at the seance) as follows: "*My
thoughts are not thy thoughts, and thy wishes are not mine, friend
Flournoy—Leopold*." At the final awakening Hélène recognized perfectly
her own handwriting in his phrase, but had no recollection of the
occurrence.

September 22, 1895.—After different visions and some stanzas of Victor
Hugo, dictated by the table, Hélène appeared to suffer considerably in
her right arm, which she was holding at the wrist with her left hand,
when the table at which she was seated gave out the following, dictated
by Leopold: "I shall hold her hand," meaning that it was he, Leopold,
who was causing Mlle. Smith to suffer pain by seizing her right hand. As
she seemed to feel very badly and began to weep, Leopold was asked to
desist; but he refused, and, still speaking through the table, said,
"Give her some paper," then, "More light." Writing material was
furnished her and the lamp brought in, which Hélène gazed at fixedly,
while Leopold continued to dictate (this time with the little finger of
her left hand), "Let her gaze on the lamp until she forgets the pain in
her arm." She then seemed, in fact, to forget her pain, and to find
satisfaction in looking at the lamp; then she fastened her eyes on the
paper, and seemed to read something there which she endeavored to copy
in pencil. But here the right hand began a curious alternation of
contrary motions, expressing in a very clear manner a contest with
Leopold, who was trying to compel her to hold the pencil in a certain
way, which Hélène refused to do, with a great pretence

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

of anger. She persisted in holding it between the index and middle
fingers, as was her wont, while Leopold wanted her to hold it in the
usual way, between the thumb and the index-finger, and said: "I do not
wish her to . . . she is holding the pencil very badly." The right
index-finger then went through a very comical gymnastic performance,
being seized with a tremor, which caused her to place it on one side or
the other of the pencil, according to whether it was Leopold or Hélène
who was victorious; during this time she frequently raised her eyes,
with a look sometimes reproachful, sometimes supplicating, as if to gaze
at Leopold standing by her side endeavoring to force her to hold the
pencil in the manner he preferred. After a contest of nearly twenty
minutes, Hélène, vanquished and completely subdued by Leopold, seemed to
be absent, while her hand, holding the pencil in the manner she did not
like, wrote slowly the two following lines, followed by a rapid and
feverish signature of Leopold:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Mes vers sont si mauvais que pour toi j’aurois dû  
 Laisser à tout jamais le poète têtu.—<span
class="smallcaps">Leopold</span>."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> An allusion, which
was of no importance, to a remark made by me at the commencement of the
seance on the verses of Victor Hugo and those of Leopold frequently
dictated by the table. The seance lasted some time longer; on awakening,
Hélène vaguely remembered having seen Leopold, but knew nothing more
concerning the handwriting scene.

It is a fact that while her other incarnations are always accomplished
passively and without any

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

struggle, that of Leopold has the peculiarity of regularly provoking
more or less resistance on the part of Hélène. " I do not make of her
all that I wish . . . she is headstrong. . . . I do not know whether I
shall succeed. . . . I do not believe I can master her to-day . . . "
replies he often when asked to incarnate himself or write with her hand,
and, indeed, his efforts often fail. There exists between Hélène and her
guide a curious phenomenon of contrast and opposition, which only breaks
out in the higher and more recent forms of motor automatism, the
handwriting, the speech, or the complete incarnation, but from which the
sensory messages and simple raps on the table or of the finger are free.
It is very possible that the idea, very antipathetic to Hélène, of the
hypnotizer mastering his subjects in spite of themselves—of the
disincarnated Cagliostro using his medium as a simple tool—has been
subconsciously the origin of this constant note of revolt against the
total domination of Leopold, and of the intense suffering which
accompanied his first incarnations, and which has slowly diminished
through her becoming accustomed to the process, though it has never been
completely banished.

After the handwriting, in its turn came speech, which also was attained
by means of two stages. In a first attempt Leopold only succeeded in
giving Hélène his intonation and pronunciation after a seance in which
she suffered acutely in her mouth and in her neck, as though her vocal
organs were being manipulated or removed; she began to talk in a natural
tone, and was apparently wide awake

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

and feeling well, but spoke with a deep bass voice, and a strong, easily
recognizable Italian accent. It was not until a year later that Leopold
was finally able to speak himself by the mouth of Mlle. Smith, while she
was completely entranced, and who did not retain on awakening any memory
of this strange occurrence. Since then the complete control of the
medium by her guide is a frequent occurrence at the seances, and affords
a tableau very characteristic and always impressive.

Leopold succeeds in incarnating himself only by slow degrees and
progressive stages. Hélène then feels as though her arms had been
seized, or as if they were absent altogether; then she complains of
disagreeable sensations, which were formerly painful, in her throat, the
nape of her neck, and in her head; her eyelids droop; her expression
changes; her throat swells into a sort of double chin, which gives her a
likeness of some sort to the well-known figure of Cagliostro. All at
once she rises, then, turning slowly towards the sitter whom Leopold is
about to address, draws herself up proudly, turns her back quickly,
sometimes with her arms crossed on her breast with a magisterial air,
sometimes with one of them hanging down while the other is pointed
solemnly towards heaven, and with her fingers makes a sort of masonic
sign, which never varies. Soon after a series of hiccoughs, sighs, and
various noises indicate the difficulty Leopold is experiencing in taking
hold of the vocal apparatus; the words come forth slowly but strong; the
deep bass voice of a man, slightly confused, with a pronunciation and
accent

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

markedly foreign, certainly more like Italian than anything else.
Leopold is not always easily understood, especially when his voice
swells and thunders out a reply to some indiscreet question or to the
disrespectful remarks of some skeptical sitter. He speaks thickly,
pronounces *g* like *j*, and all his *u’s* like *ou*, accents the final
syllables, embellishes his vocabulary with obsolete words, or words
which do not fit the circumstances, such as *fiole* for *bouteille*,
*omnibus* for *tramways*, etc. He is pompous, grandiloquent, unctuous,
sometimes severe and terrible, sometimes also sentimental. He says
"thee" and "thou" to everybody, and appears to believe that he is still
grand-master of the secret societies, from the emphatic and sonorous
manner in which he pronounces the words "Brother" or "And thou, my
sister," by which he addresses the sitters. Although he generally
addresses himself to one of them in particular, and holds very little
collective discourse, he is in touch with every one, listens to
everything that is said, and each one may have his turn in conversation
with him. Ordinarily he keeps his eyelids closed: he has, nevertheless,
been persuaded to open his eyes in order to permit the taking of a
photograph by a flash light. I regret that Mlle. Smith would not consent
to the publication of her photographs, either in her normal state or in
that of Leopold, in connection with the reproduction of a portrait of
Cagliostro. <span id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_10.md) The reader may assure
himself

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

that when she incarnates her guide she really assumes a certain
resemblance of features to him, and there is something in her attitude
which is sometimes somewhat theatrical, but sometimes really majestic,
which corresponds well to the generally received idea of this personage,
whether he is regarded as a clever impostor or as a wonderful genius.

Speech is the apogee of the incarnations of Leopold; often interrupted
by fits of hiccoughs and spasms, it seems to be injurious to Hélène's
organism, and there are some seances at which attempts to produce it
fail to succeed. Leopold, on these occasions, indicates his impotence
and the fatigue of the medium by his gestures, and is then reduced to
the necessity of expressing himself by digital dictations or
handwriting, or else to giving Hélène verbo-auditive hallucinations, the
content of which she repeats in her natural voice.

From the point of view of ease and mobility of the entire organism,
there is a notable difference between Leopold and the other incarnations
of Hélène: these last seem to be effected with much more facility than
in the case of that of her guide par excellence. In the case of the
Hindoo princess and that of Marie Antoinette, the perfection of the
play, the suppleness and freedom of movement, are always admirable. It
is true there is no question here, according to the spiritistic doctrine
and the subconscious ideas of Mlle. Smith, of incarnations properly so
called, since it

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

is she herself who simply returns to that which she formerly was, by a
sort of reversion or prenatal ecmnesia; she does not undergo, in
consequence, any foreign possession, and can in these rôles preserve her
natural identity and the entire disposition of her faculties. But still
the occasional incarnation of different personalities, such as those of
deceased parents or friends of the spectators, are often more easily and
quickly effected than that of Leopold. Hélène moves in these cases with
more vivacity and changes of attitude. In the rôle of Cagliostro, on the
other hand, with the exception of the grandiose and not very frequent
movements of the arms, once standing, she remains motionless, or only
with difficulty advancing a little way towards the person to whom she
addresses her discourse.

The content of the oral conversations of Leopold, as well as of his
other messages by the various sensory and motor processes, is too varied
for me to describe here: the numerous examples scattered through this
work only can give an idea of it.

#### III. LEOPOLD AND THE TRUE JOSEPH BALSAMO

It would naturally be supposed that Leopold would have given us, by
means of the psychological perfection of his partial or total
incarnations and by the content of his messages; such a living likeness
of Cagliostro that there would have been occasion to ask whether it is
not really the latter who actually "returns," in the same way that Dr.
Hodgson and his

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

colleagues ask themselves whether it is not actually George Pelham who
manifests himself through Mrs. Piper. Let us suppose, for example, that
Leopold possessed a handwriting, an orthography, a style identical with
that which is found here and there in the manuscripts of Joseph Balsamo;
that he spoke French, Italian, or German, as that cosmopolitan
adventurer did, and with all the same peculiarities; that his
conversations and messages were full of precise allusions to actual
events in his life, and also of unpublished but verifiable facts, etc.
In that case the difficult and delicate task of proving that Mlle. Smith
had no knowledge through normal methods of these thousand exact features
would still remain, and we should not be forced to ask whether this
soi-disant authentic revenant is simply a very well-gotten-up
simulacrum, an admirable reconstruction, a marvellous imitation, such as
the subliminal faculties are only too glad to produce for the diversion
of psychologists and the mystification of the simple.

This problem is not given to us. I regret it, but it is true,
nevertheless—to my mind, at least, for in these matters it is prudent to
speak only for one's self—that there is no reason to suspect the real
presence of Joseph Balsamo behind the automatisms of Mlle. Smith.

That there are very curious analogies between what is known to us of
Cagliostro and certain characteristic traits of Leopold, I do not deny,
but they are precisely such as accord very well with the supposition of
the subliminal medley.

Let us consider first the handwriting. To facilitate the comparison, I
have reproduced here (see pp. [109](#page_109) and [111](#page_111).md)
some fragments of letters of Cagliostro and of Leopold and of Hélène.
Let us suppose—which is, perhaps, open to discussion—that the
handwriting of Leopold, by its regularity, its firmness, resembles that
of Balsamo more than that of Mlle. Smith; the degree of resemblance does
not, I think, go beyond that which might be expected considering the
notorious fact that handwriting reflects the psychological temperament
and modifies itself in accordance with the state of the
personality. <span id="fr_11"></span>[\*](#fn_11.md)

It is well known how the calligraphy of a [hyptonized](errata.htm#1.md)
subject varies according to the suggestion that he shall personate
Napoleon, Harpagon, a little girl, or an old man; there is nothing
surprising in the fact that the hypnoid secondary personality of Hélène,
which imagines itself to be the powerful and manly Count of Cagliostro,
should be accompanied by muscular tensions communicating to the
handwriting itself a little of that solidity and breadth which are found
in the autograph of Balsamo. To this, however, the analogy is limited.
The dissimilarities in the detail and the formation of the letters are
such that the only conclusion which they warrant is that Mlle. Smith, or
her subconsciousness, has never laid eyes on the manuscripts of
Cagliostro. They are, indeed, rare, but the facilities she might have
had, of which she has riot thought of taking

</div>

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

advantage, for consulting in the Geneva public library the same volume
from which I took [Fig. 5](#img_fig05.md), would prove, at least, her good
faith and her honesty, if it were in the least necessary. The
extravagant signature of Leopold with which all his messages are
subscribed (see [Fig. 7](#img_fig07).md) recalls in no wise that of
Alessandro di Cagliostro at the bottom of [Fig. 5](#img_fig05.md).

The archaic forms of orthography, *j’aurois* for *j’aurais*, etc., which
appear above the first autograph of Leopold (see [p. 99](#page_99).md), and
which occur again in the messages of Marie Antoinette, constitute a very
pretty hit, of which the ordinary self would probably never dream by way
of voluntary imitation, but by which the subconscious imagination has
seen fit to profit. It is undoubtedly a matter for wonderment that Mlle.
Smith, who has not gone very deep into literary studies, should,
nevertheless, have retained these orthographic peculiarities of the
eighteenth century; but we must not overlook the fineness of choice, the
refined sensibility, the consummate, albeit instinctive, art which
presides over the sorting and storing away of the subconscious memories.
By some natural affinity, the idea of a personage of a certain epoch
attracts and gathers into its net everything that the subject can
possibly learn or hear spoken concerning the fashion of writing, of
speaking, or acting, peculiar to that epoch. I do not know whether
Balsamo ever used the French language and the orthography that Leopold
employs. Even if he did, it would not weaken the hypothesis of the
subliminal imitation, but if, on the other hand, it should be
ascertained that he

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

did not, the hypothesis would be greatly strengthened thereby.

As for the speech, I am ignorant as to how, with what accent and what
peculiarities of pronunciation, Balsamo spoke the French tongue, and to
what degree, in consequence, his reconstruction by Hélène's subliminal
fantasy correctly hits it. If this point could be cleared up, it would
probably be found to be just like that of the handwriting. Nothing could
be more natural than to ascribe to the *chevalier d’industrie* of
Palermo a very masculine, deep-bass voice, and, it goes without saying,
as Italian as possible. It must be noted, too, that Mlle. Smith often
heard her father speak that language, which he knew very well, with
several of his friends; but that, on the other hand, she does not speak
it, and has never learned it. Leopold, however, does not know Italian,
and turns a deaf ear when any one addresses him in that language. The
intonation, the attitude, the whole physiognomy, in short, accord with
these remarks. As to the extremely varied content of the conversations
and messages of Leopold, we are not obliged to consider Balsamo as their
necessary author. When everything relating to Mlle. Smith and the
sitters, but which has nothing to do with the last century, has been
swept aside, together with the spiritistic dissertations in regard to
the "fluid" manner in which Leopold exists, perceives, and moves, the
three subjects or categories of communications still remain, which merit
a rapid examination.

In the first place, there. are the answers of Leopold

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

to the questions put to him concerning his terrestrial life. These
answers are remarkably evasive or vague. Not a name, not a date, not a
precise fact does he furnish. We only learn that he has travelled
extensively, suffered greatly, studied deeply, done much good, and
healed a great many sick folk; but now he sees things too lofty to think
any more about historic details of the past, and it is with unconcealed
disgust or direct words of reproach for the idle curiosity of his carnal
questioners that he hastens to turn the conversation, like Socrates, to
moral subjects and those of a lofty philosophy, where he feels evidently
more at ease. When he is further pressed he becomes angry sometimes, and
sometimes ingenuously avows his ignorance, enveloping it meanwhile in an
air of profound mystery. " They are asking the secret of my life, of my
acts, of my thoughts. I cannot answer." This does not facilitate
investigation of the question of identity.

In the second place come the consultations and medical prescriptions.
Leopold affects a lofty disdain for modern medicine and phenic acid. He
is as archaic in his therapeutics as in his orthography, and treats all
maladies after the ancient mode. Baths of pressed grape-skins for
rheumatism, an infusion of coltsfoot and juniper-berry in white wine for
inflammations of the chest, the bark of the horse-chestnut in red wine
and douches of salt water as tonics, tisanes of hops and other flowers,
camomile, oil of lavender, the leaves of the ash, etc.; all these do not
accord badly with what Balsamo might have prescribed a century or more
ago. The misfortune,

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

from the evidential point of view, is that Mlle. Smith's mother is
extremely well versed in all the resources of popular medicine where old
recipes are perpetuated. She has had occasion to nurse many sick people
in her life, knows the virtues of different medicinal plants, and
constantly employs, with a sagacity which I have often admired, a number
of those remedies spoken of as "old-women's," which make the young
doctors fresh from the clinic smile, but to which they will more than
once resort in secret after a few years of medical experience.

Finally, there still remain the sentiments of Leopold for Hélène, which
he claims are only the continuation of those of Cagliostro for Marie
Antoinette. My ignorance of history does not permit me to pronounce
categorically on this point. That the Queen of France did have some
secret interviews with the famous "gold-maker," due to simple curiosity
or to questions of material interest, there is no doubt, I believe; but
that his feelings for his sovereign were a curious combination of the
despairing passion of Cardinal Rohan for the queen, with the absolute
respect which Alexandre Dumas, *père*, ascribes to Joseph Balsamo
towards Lorenza Feliciani, appears to me less evident.

In short, if the revelations of Leopold have truly unveiled to us shades
of feeling of Count Cagliostro hitherto unsuspected, and of which later
documentary researches shall confirm the historic correctness—why, so
much the better, for that will finally establish a trace of the
supernormal in the mediumship of Hélène!

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

#### IV. LEOPOLD AND MLLE. SMITH

The connection between these two personalities is too complex for a
precise description. There is neither a mutual exclusion, as between
Mrs. Piper and Phinuit, who appear reciprocally to be ignorant of each
other and to be separated by the tightest of partitions; nor a simple
jointing, as in the case of Felida X., whose secondary state envelops
and overflows the whole primary state. This is more of a crossing of
lines, but of which the limits are vague and with difficulty assignable.
Leopold knows, foresees, and recalls very many things of which the
normal personality of Mlle. Smith knows absolutely nothing, not only of
those which she may simply have forgotten, but of those of which she
never had any consciousness. On the other hand, he is far from
possessing all the memories of Hélène; he is ignorant of a very great
part of her daily life; even some very notable incidents escape him
entirely, which explains his way of saying that, to his great regret, he
cannot remain constantly by her, being obliged to occupy himself with
other missions (concerning which he has never enlightened us) which
oblige him often to leave her for a time.

These two personalities are, therefore, not co-extensive; each one
passes beyond the other at certain points, without its being possible
for us to say which is, on the whole, the more extended. As to their
common domain, if it cannot be defined by one word with entire
certainty, it appears, nevertheless, to be

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

chiefly constituted by its connection with the innermost ranges of the
being, both physiological and psychological, as might be suspected from
what I remarked above concerning the real origin of Leopold. Physician
of the soul and of the body, director of conscience, and at the same
time hygienic counsellor, he does not always manifest himself
immediately, but he is always present when Hélène's vital interests are
involved. This will be made clearer by two or three concrete examples,
which will at the same time illustrate some of the psychological
processes by which Leopold manifests himself to Hélène.

It must be admitted that there is a disagreement and opposition as
complete as possible (but how far does this "possible" go?) when Hélène,
in at least an apparently waking state, converses with her guide,
manifestly by a partial sensory or motor automatism; for example, in the
case cited on page [64](ipm05.htm#page_64.md), where Leopold, not sharing
the allochiria of Hélène, declared by the table that she was wrong, so
emphatically that she protested and became angry; also, when in
verbo-auditive hallucinations, or by automatic handwriting, he enters
into discussion with her, and she holds her own with him; or, again,
when the organism seems to be divided up between two different persons,
Leopold speaking by Hélène's mouth, with his accent, and uttering his
own ideas to her, and she complaining, in writing, of pains in her head
and throat, without understanding their cause. Nevertheless, in these
cases of division of the consciousness, which appear to amount to its
cutting

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

in two, it is doubtful whether this plurality is more than apparent. I
am not positive of having ever established with Hélène a veritable
simultaneity of different consciousnesses. At the very moment at which
Leopold writes by her hand, speaks by her mouth, dictates to the table,
upon observing her attentively I have always found her absorbed,
preoccupied, as though absent; but she instantaneously recovers her
presence of mind and the use of her waking faculties at the end of the
motor automatism. In short, that which from the outside is taken for the
coexistence of distinct simultaneous personalities seems to me to be
only an alternation, a rapid succession between the state of
Hélène-consciousness and the state of Leopold-consciousness; and, in the
case where the body seems to be jointly occupied by two independent
beings—the right side, for instance, being occupied by Leopold, and the
left by Hélène, or the Hindoo princess—the psychical division has never
seemed to me to be radical, but many indications have combined to make
me of the opinion that behind all was an individuality perfectly
self-conscious, and enjoying thoroughly, along with the spectators, the
comedy of the plural existences.

A single fundamental personality, putting the questions and giving the
answers, quarrelling with itself in its own interior—in a word, enacting
all the various rôles of Mlle. Smith—is a fitting interpretation, which
accords very well with the facts as I have observed them in Hélène, and
very much better than the theory of a plurality of separate
consciousnesses,

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

of a psychological polyzoism, so to speak. This last theory is doubtless
more convenient for a clear and superficial description of the facts,
but I am not at all convinced that it conforms to the actual condition
of affairs.

It is a state of consciousness sui generis, which it is impossible
adequately to describe, and which can only be represented by the analogy
of those curious states, exceptional in the normal waking life, but less
rare in dreams, when one seems to change his identity and become some
one else.

Hélène has more than once told me of having had the impression of
*becoming* or *being* momentarily Leopold. This happens most frequently
at night, or upon awakening in the morning. She has first a fugitive
vision of her protector; then it seems that little by little he is
submerged in her; she feels him overcoming and penetrating her entire
organism, as if he really became her or she him. These mixed states are
extremely interesting to the psychologist; unhappily, because they
generally take place in a condition of consecutive amnesia, or because
the mediums do not know how, or do not wish, to give a complete account
of them, it is very rare that detailed descriptions are obtained.

Between the two extremes of complete duality and complete unity numerous
intermediate states are to be observed; or, at least, since the
consciousness of another cannot be directly penetrated, these mixed
states may be inferred from the consequences which spring from them.

It has happened, for example, that, believing they

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

were dealing with Leopold alone, thoroughly incarnated and duly
substituted for the personality of Mlle. Smith, the sitters have allowed
to escape them on that account some ill-timed pleasantry, some
indiscreet question or too free criticisms, all innocent enough and
without evil intention, but still of a nature to wound Hélène if she had
heard them, and from which the authors would certainly have abstained in
her presence in a waking state.

Leopold has not stood upon ceremony in putting down these imprudent
babblers, and the incident, generally, has had no further consequences.
But sometimes the words and bearing of Mlle. Smith for days or weeks
afterwards show that she was aware of the imprudent remarks, which
proves that the consciousness of Leopold and her own are not separated
by an impenetrable barrier, but that osmotic changes are effected from
the one to the other. It is ordinarily pointed and irritating remarks
which cause the trouble, which goes to prove that it is the feelings of
self-love or personal susceptibility that form in each one of us the
inmost fortifications of the social self, and are the last to be
destroyed by somnambulism, or that they constitute the fundamental
substratum, the common base by which Leopold and Mlle. Smith form a
whole and mingle themselves in the same individuality.

The psychological process of this transmission is varied from another
cause. Sometimes it appears that the consecutive amnesia of the trance
has been broken as to the most piquant details, and that Hélène clearly
remembers that which has been said, in the

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

presence of Leopold, disagreeable to herself. Some times it is Leopold
himself who repeats to her the unpleasant expressions which have been
used, with commentaries calculated to lessen their effect and to excuse
the culprits: for it is an interesting trait of his character that he
undertakes with Hélène the defence of those same persons whom he
reprimands and blames, a contradiction not at all surprising when it is
psychologically interpreted, considering the habitual conflict of
emotional motives or tendencies, the warfare which opposite points of
view is incessantly carrying on in our inmost being. Sometimes, again,
it is in a dream that the junction is effected between the
somnambulistic consciousness of Leopold and the normal consciousness of
Hélène.

Apropos of the last case, here is an example containing nothing
disagreeable, in which Hélène remembered in her waking state a nocturnal
dream, which was itself a repetition or echo, in natural sleep, of a
somnambulistic scene of the previous evening.

In a seance at which I assisted, shortly after my recovery from an
attack of congestion of the lungs, Hélène, completely entranced, has a
vision of Leopold-Cagliostro, who, in the rôle of sympathetic physician,
comes to hold a consultation with me. After some preliminaries she
kneels down by my chair, and, looking alternately at my chest and at the
fictitious doctor standing between us, she holds a long conversation
with him, in which she explains the condition of my lungs, which she
sees in imagination, and the treatment which Leopold prescribes,
somewhat as follows:

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> ". . . It is the
lungs . . . it is darker . . . it is one side which has been affected .
. . You say that it is a severe inflammation—and can that be healed? . .
. Tell me, what must be done . . . Oh, where have I seen any of these
plants? . . . I don't know what they are called . . . those . . . I
don't understand very well . . . those synantherous? . . . Oh, what a
queer name . . . Where are they to be found? . . . You say it belongs to
the family of . . . then it has another name? Tell me what it is . . .
some *tissulages* \[sic\] . . . Then you think this plant is good for
him? . . . Ah! but explain this to me . . . the fresh leaves or the
dried flowers? Three times a day, a large handful in a pint . . . and
then honey and milk. . . . I will tell him that he must drink three cups
a day . . ." etc. Then followed very detailed directions as to
treatment, various infusions, blisters, etc. The whole scene lasted more
than an hour, followed by complete amnesia, and nothing was said to
Hélène about it, as it was half-past six in the evening, and she was in
haste to return home. The next day she wrote me a seven-page letter in
which she described a very striking dream she had had during the night.
". . . I fell asleep about two o'clock in the morning and awaked at
about five. Was it a vision? Was it a dream I had? I don't really know
what to consider it and dare not say; but this I do know, I saw my dear
friend Leopold, who spoke to me a long time about you, and I think I saw
you also. I asked him what he thought of your state of health. . . . He
replied that in his opinion it was far from re-established, That the
pain

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

you feel in the right side came from an inflammation of the lung which
has been seriously affected . . . You will doubtless laugh when I tell
you that he also described the remedies you ought to take. . . . One of
them is a simple plant, which is called, as nearly as I can remember,
Tissulage or Tussilache, but has also another name, which I cannot
recollect, but the first name will doubtless suffice, since he says you
are familiar with the plant . . ." etc.

What I have said concerning Leopold is also applicable to the other
personifications of Mlle. Smith. The normal consciousness of Hélène
mingles and fuses itself in every way with the somnambulistic
consciousness of Simandini, of Marie Antoinette, or some other
incarnation, as we shall soon see. I pass now to the examination of some
detailed examples, destined to throw light upon the rôle which Leopold
plays in Hélène's existence.

Let us begin by listening to Leopold himself. Among his numerous
messages, the following letter, written in his fine handwriting by the
hand of Mlle. Smith—in response to a note in which I had begged him (as
a spiritual being and distinct from her) to aid me in my " psychic
researches"—contains information for which I had not asked, but which
was none the less interesting. It must not be forgotten that it is the
disincarnate adorer of Marie Antoinette who is writing:

 

"<span class="smallcaps">Friend</span>,—I am pleased and touched by the
mark of confidence you have deigned to accord me. The spiritual guide of
Mademoiselle \[Smith\], whom the

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Supreme Being in
his infinite goodness has permitted me to find again with ease, I do all
I can to appear to her on every occasion when I deem it necessary; but
my body, or, if you prefer, the matter of little solidity of which I am
composed, does not always afford me the facility of showing myself to
her in a positive human manner. \[He, in fact, appeared to her often
under the form of elementary visual hallucinations, a luminous trail,
whitish column, vaporous streamer, etc.\]

"That which I seek above all to inculcate in her is a consoling and true
philosophy, which is necessary to her by reason of the profound, unhappy
impressions, which even now still remain to her, of the whole drama of
her past life. I have often sown bitterness in her heart \[when she was
Marie Antoinette\], desiring only her welfare. Also, laying aside
everything superfluous, I penetrate into the most hidden recesses of her
soul, and with an extreme care and incessant activity I seek to implant
there those truths which I trust will aid her in attaining the lofty
summit of the ladder of perfection.

"Abandoned by my parents front my cradle, I have, indeed, known sorrow
early in life. Like all, I have had many weaknesses, which I have
expiated, and God knows that I bow to His will!

"Moral suffering has been my principal lot. I have been full of
bitterness, of envy, of hatred, of jealousy. Jealousy, my brother! what
a poison, what a corruption of the soul!

"Nevertheless, one ray has shone brightly into my life, and that ray so
pure, so full of everything

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

that might pour balm on my wounded soul, has given, me a glimpse of
heaven!

"Herald of eternal felicity! ray without spot! God deemed best to take
it before me! But to-clay it is given back to me! May His holy name be
blessed!

"Friend, in what manner shall I reply to you? I am ignorant myself, not
knowing what it will please God to reveal to you, but through her whom
you call Mademoiselle \[Smith\], God willing, perhaps we shall be able
to satisfy you.

"Thy friend,

"LEOPOLD."

 

We can see, under the flowing details of the spiritistic ideas and his
rôle as the repentant Cagliostro, that the dominant characteristic of
Leopold is his deep platonic attachment for Mlle. Smith, and an ardent
moral solicitude for her and her advance towards perfection. This
corresponds perfectly with the character of the numerous messages which
he addresses to her in the course of her daily existence, as may he seen
from the following specimen. He is referring to a case where, after
having warned her on two occasions during the day by auditive
hallucinations that he would manifest himself in the evening, he gives
her, in fact, by automatic writing in his own hand, the encouragement
she was actually in need of under the circumstances in which she found
herself.

One morning, at her desk, Hélène heard an unknown voice, stronger and
nearer to her than is usual

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

with Leopold, say to her: "Until this evening"; a little later the same
voice, which she now recognized as that of Leopold, but of a quality
rougher and nearer to her than was his habit, said to her: "You
understand me well, until this evening." In the evening, having returned
home, she was excited at supper, left the table in haste towards the end
of the meal, and shut herself up in her room with the idea that she
would learn something; but, presently, the instinctive agitation of her
hand indicated to her that she should take her pencil, and having done
so, she obtained in the beautiful calligraphy of Leopold the following
epistle. (She says that she remained wide awake and self-conscious while
writing it, and it is the only occasion of a similar character when she
had knowledge of the content.)

 

"<span class="smallcaps">My beloved Friend</span>,—Why do you vex
yourself, torment yourself so? Why are you indignant, because, as you
advance in life, you are obliged to acknowledge that all things are not
as you had wished and hoped they might be? Is not the route we follow on
this earth always and for all of us strewn with rocks? is it not an
endless chain of deceptions, of miseries? Do me the kindness, my dear
sister, I beg of you, to tell me that from this time forth you will
cease from endeavoring to probe too deeply the human heart. In what will
such discoveries aid you? What remains to you of these things, except
tears and regrets? And then this God of love, of justice, and of life—is
not He the one to read our hearts? It is for Him, not for thee, to see
into them.

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

"Would you change the hearts? Would you give them that which they have
not, a live, ardent soul, never departing from what is right, just, and
true? Be calm, then, in the face of all these little troubles. Be
worthy, and, above all, always good! In thee I have found again that
heart and that soul, both of which will always be for me all my life,
all my joy, and my only dream here below.

"Believe me: be calm: reflect: that is my wish."

"Thy friend,

"<span class="smallcaps">Leopold</span>."

I have chosen this example for the sake of its brevity. Hélène has
received a number of communications of the same kind, sometimes in
verse, in which the moral and religious note is often still more
accentuated. In the greater part we meet with, as in the next to the
last phrase of the foregoing letter, an allusion to the presumed
affection of Cagliostro for Marie Antoinette. It is to be noticed that
there is nothing in these excellent admonitions that a high and serious
soul like that of Mlle. Smith could not have drawn from its own depths
in a moment of contemplation and meditation.

Is it a benefit or an injury to the moral and truly religious life to
formulate itself thus clearly in verbal hallucinations rather than to
remain in the confused but more personal state of experienced
aspirations and strongly expressed emotions? Do these inspirations gain
or lose in inward authority and subjective power by assuming this
exterior garb and this aspect of objectivity? This is a delicate

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

question, probably not susceptible of a uniform solution.

In the following incident, which I relate as an example among many other
similar ones, it is no longer, properly speaking, the moral and
religious sentiments personified in Leopold, but rather the instinct of
reserve and of defence peculiar to the weaker sex, the sense of the
proprieties, the self-respect, tinctured with a shade of exaggeration
almost amounting to prudery.

In a visit to Mlle. Smith, during which I inquired whether she had
received any recent communications from Leopold, she told me she had
only seen him two or three times in the last few days, and had been
struck by his "restless and unhappy" air, instead of the air "so
pleasant, so sweet, so admirable," which he generally has. As she did
not know to what to attribute this change of countenance, I advised her
to take her pencil and to wrap herself in meditation, with the hope of
obtaining some automatic message.

In about a minute her expression indicated that she was being taken
possession of; her eyes were fixed on the paper, upon which her left
hand rested, the thumb and little finger being agitated and continually
tapping (about once a second), the right hand having tried to take the
pencil between the index and middle finger (the manner of Hélène), ended
by seizing it between the thumb and the index finger, and traced slowly
in the handwriting of Leopold:

"Yes, I am restless \| pained, even in anguish. \|

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Believest thou,
friend, that it is with satisfaction \| that I see you every day
accepting the attentions, the flatteries; \| I do not, call them
insincere, but of little worth, and little praiseworthy \| on the part
of those from whom they come." \|

This text was written at six separate times (marked by the vertical
bars), separated by brief moments of full wakefulness, when the tappings
of the left hand ceased, and when Hélène, repeating in a loud voice what
she was about to write, is very much astonished, does not know to what
Leopold alludes, then at my request takes her pencil to obtain an
explanation, and falls asleep again during the following fragment. At
the end of this bit, as she persists in saying that she is ignorant of
what he refers to, I proceed to question Leopold, who replies that for
several days Hélène has permitted herself to be courted by a M. V.
(perfectly honorably), who often found himself on the same street-car
with her, had made a place for her beside him the last few mornings, and
had paid her some compliments on her appearance.

These revelations excited the laughter and protestations of Hélène, who
commenced to deny that it could have come from Leopold, and accused me
of having suggested it to her little finger; but the right hand took the
pencil and traced these words in the handwriting and with the signature
of Leopold: "I only say what I think, and I desire that you refuse
henceforth all the flowers that he may offer you.—Leopold." This time
Hélène remembered the incident, and recollected that yesterday morning
he had

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

offered her a rose which he was wearing as a boutonnière.

Eight days later I paid another visit to Hélène, and after an effort to
secure some handwriting, which was not successful, but resulted in a
Martian vision (see Martian text No. 14), she had a visual hallucination
of Leopold, and losing consciousness of the actual environment and of my
presence also, as well as that of her mother, she flung herself into a
running conversation with him in regard to the incident of eight days
previously: "Leopold . . . Leopold . . . don't come near me \[repulsing
him\]. You are too severe, Leopold! . . . Will you come on Sunday? I am
going to be at M. Flournoy's next Sunday. You will be there . . . but
take good care that you do not . . . No, it is not kind of you always to
disclose secrets. . . . What must he have thought? . . . You seem to
make a mountain out of a mole-hill. . . . And who would think of
refusing a flower? You don't understand at all. . . . Why, then? It was
a very simple thing to accept it, a matter of no importance whatever . .
. to refuse it would have been impolite. . . . You pretend to read the
heart. . . . Why give importance to a thing that amounts to nothing? . .
. It is only a simple act of friendship, a little token of sympathy . .
. to make me write such things on paper before everybody! not nice of
you!" In this somnambulistic dialogue, in which we can divine Leopold's
replies, Hélène took for the moment the accent of Marie Antoinette (see
below, in the "Royal cycle"). To awaken her, Leopold, who had possession
of Hélène's arms, made

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

some passes over her forehead, then pressed the frontal and suborbital
nerves of the left side, and made me a sign to do the same with those of
the right. The seance of the next day but one, at my house, passed
without any allusion by Leopold to the incident of the street-car,
evidently on account of the presence of certain sitters to whom he did
not wish to reveal Hélène's secrets. But, three days after, in a new
visit, during which she told me of having had a waking discussion
concerning the future life (without telling me with whom), she again
wrote, in the hand of Leopold: "It is not in such society as this that
you ought so seriously to discuss the immortality of the soul." She then
confessed that it was again on the street-car, and with M. V., that she
had held that conversation while a funeral procession was passing. There
was never anything that might have been of a compromising character in
the exchange of courtesies and the occasional conversations of Mlle.
Smith with her neighbor of the street-car. The trouble that it caused
poor Leopold was very characteristic of him, and well indicated the
severe and jealous censor who formerly had worried the N. group; there
can be heard again the echo of that voice, "which has absolutely nothing
to do with the conscience" (see pp. [27](ipm04.htm#page_27.md) and
[82](#page_82).md), and which has hitherto prevented Hélène from accepting
any of the suitors whom she has encountered in the course of her journey
through life. This austere and rigorous mentor, always wide awake, and
taking offence at the least freedom which Mlle. Smith allows herself in
the exchange of trifling courtesies,

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

represents, in fact, a very common psychological attribute; it is not
every well-bred feminine soul that carries stored in one of its
recesses, where it manifests its presence by scruples more or less
vaguely felt, certain hesitations or apprehensions, inhibiting feelings
or tendencies of a shade of intensity varying according to the age and
the temperament.

It is not my part to describe this delicate phenomenon. It suffices me
to remark that here, as in the ethico-religious messages, the
personality of Leopold has in no way aided the essential content of
those inward experiences of which Mlle. Smith is perfectly capable by
herself; the form only of their manifestation has gained in picturesque
and dramatic expression in the *mise-en-scène* of the automatic
handwritings and of the somnambulistic dialogue. It seems as though the
suggestive approach of my presence and my questions had been necessary
to excite these phenomena; it is, however, very probable, to judge from
other examples, that my influence only hastened the explosion of Leopold
in formulated reproaches, and that his latent discontent, hitherto
noticed in the "restless and suffering air" of his fugitive visual
apparitions, would have terminated, after a period of incubation more or
less prolonged, in breaking out into spontaneous admonitions, auditive
or written.

It can be divined that in this rôle of vigilant guardian, of an almost
excessive zealousness for the honor or the dignity of Mlle. Smith,
Leopold is again, to my mind, only a product of psychological
duplication. He represents a certain grouping of inward

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

desires and secret instincts, which the hypnoid predisposition,
encouraged by spiritism, has brought into a peculiar prominence and
given an aspect of foreign personality; in the same way, in the
phantasmagoria of the dream, certain after-thoughts, almost unperceived
while awake, rise to the first plane and become transformed into
contradictory fictitious personages, whose cutting reproaches astonish
us sometimes on awakening by their disturbing truthfulness.

A final example will show us Leopold, in his rôle of watcher over the
health of Mlle. Smith and adviser of precautions which she ought to
take. He is not troubled about her general health; when she had *la
grippe*, for instance, or when she is simply worn out with fatigue, he
scarcely shows himself. His attention is concentrated upon certain
special physiological functions, of the normal exercise of which he
takes care to be assured. He does not otherwise seem to exercise a
positive action upon them, and cannot modify them in any way; his office
seems to be confined to knowing beforehand their exact course, and to
see that Hélène is not guilty of any imprudence which may impede them.

Leopold here shows a knowledge and prevision of the most intimate
phenomena of the organism which has been observed in the case of
secondary personalities, and which confers upon them, in that respect at
least, an unquestionable advantage over the ordinary personality. In the
case of Mlle. Smith, the indications of her guide are always of a
prohibitive nature, calculated to prevent her from

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

taking part in spiritistic reunions at a time at which she believes
herself able to do so with impunity, but which he, endowed with a more
refined cœnæsthetic sensibility, thinks she ought not to undertake. He
has for several years formally laid his ban upon every kind of
mediumistic exercises at certain very regular periods.

He has also on numerous occasions compelled her by various messages,
categorical auditive hallucinations, diverse impulses, contractures of
the arms, forcing her to write, etc., to modify her plans and to abandon
seances already arranged. This is a very clear form of teleological
automatism.

As a specimen of this spontaneous and hygienic intervention of Leopold
in the life of Hélène, I have selected the letter given below, because
it combines several interesting traits. It well depicts the energy with
which Mlle. Smith is compelled to obey her guide.

The passage from the auditive to the graphic form of automatism is also
to be noticed in it. Apropos of this, in the page of this letter
reproduced in [Fig. 8](#img_fig08) (see [p. 137](#page_137).md), it is made
clear that the transition of the hand of Hélène to that of Leopold is
accomplished brusquely and in a decided manner. The handwriting is not
metamorphosed gradually, slowly, but continues to be that of Mlle.
Smith, becoming more and more agitated, it is true, and rendered almost
illegible by the shocks to the arm of which Leopold takes hold up to the
moment when, suddenly and by a bound, it becomes the well-formed
calligraphy of Cagliostro.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

<span class="small">"*January* 29, 6.15 <span
class="smallcaps">a.m.</span></span>

"<span class="smallcaps">Monsieur</span>,—I awoke about ten minutes ago,
and heard the voice of Leopold telling me in a very imperious manner,
'Get up out of your bed, and quickly, very quickly, write to your dear
friend, M. Flournoy, that you will not hold a seance to-morrow, and that
you will not be able to go to his house for two weeks, and that you will
not hold any seance within that period.' I have executed his order,
having felt myself forced, compelled in spite of myself, to obey. I was
so comfortable in bed and so vexed at being obliged to write you such a
message; but I feel myself forced to do what he bids me.

"At this moment I am looking at my watch; it is 6.25 o'clock. I feel a
very strong shock in my right arm—I might better speak of it as an
electric disturbance—and which I perceive has made me . write crooked. I
hear also at this instant the voice of Leopold. I have much difficulty
in writing what he tells me: '6.42½ . Say to him this: *I am, sir,
always your very devoted servant, in body and mind, healthy and not
unbalanced*.'

"I stopped for some moments after writing these words, which I saw very
well, after having written them, were in the handwriting of Leopold.
Immediately afterwards, a second disturbance, similar to the first, gave
me a fresh shock, this time from my feet to my head. It all passed so
quickly that I am disturbed and confused by it. It is true that I am not
yet quite well. Is this the reason why Leopold prevents my going to
Florissant to-morrow? I do not know, but, nevertheless, am anxious to
follow his advice. . . ."

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

Mlle. Smith always submits obediently to the commands of her guide,
since, whenever she has transgressed them, through forgetfulness or
neglect, she has had cause to repent it.

It is clear that in this rôle of special physician of Mlle. Smith,
always au courant of her state of health, Leopold could easily be
interpreted as personifying those vague impressions which spring forth
continually from the depths of our physical being, informing us as to
what is passing there.

A neuralgic toothache is felt in a dream hours before it makes itself
felt in our waking consciousness, while some maladies are often thus
foreshadowed several days before they actually declare themselves. All
literature is full of anecdotes of this kind; and the psychiatrists have
observed that in the form of circular alienation, where phases of
melancholic depression and maniacal excitation alternately succeed one
another more or less regularly with intervals of normal
[equilibrium](errata.htm#2.md), it is frequently in sleep that the first
symptoms of the change of humor can be detected which has already begun
in the depths of the individuality, but will only break forth on the
outside a little later. But all the hypnoid states are connected, and it
is not at all surprising that, in the case of a subject inclined to
automatism, these confused presentiments should arise with the
appearance of a foreign personality which is only a degree higher than
the process of dramatization already so brilliantly at work in our
ordinary dreams.

It will be useless to lengthen or further multiply examples of the
intervention of Leopold in the life

of Mlle. Smith. Those which I have given show him under his essential
aspects, and suffice to justify Hélène's confidence in a guide who has
never deceived her, who has always given her the best counsel, delivered
discourses of the highest ethical tone, and manifested the most touching
solicitude for her physical and moral health. It is easy to understand
that nothing can shake her faith in the real, objective existence of
this precious counsellor.

It is really vexatious that the phenomena of dreams should be so little
observed or so badly understood (I do not say by psychologists, but by
the general public, which prides itself on its psychology), since the
dream is the prototype of spiritistic messages, and holds the key to the
explanation of mediumistic phenomena. If it is regrettable to see such
noble, sympathetic, pure, and in all respects remarkable personalities
as Leopold reduced to the rank of a dream creation, it must be
remembered, however, that dreams are not always, as idle folk think,
things to be despised or of no value in themselves: the majority are
insignificant and deserve only the oblivion to which they are promptly
consigned. A very large number are bad and sometimes even worse than
reality; but there are others of a better sort, and "dream" is often a
synonym for "ideal."

To sum up, Leopold certainly expresses in his central nucleus a very
honorable and attractive side of the character of Mlle. Smith, and in
taking him as her "guide" she only follows inspirations which are
probably among the best of her nature.
