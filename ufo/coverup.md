    The following is a "working hypothesis" written by John Lear on
    December 29, 1987, and revised on January 14 and again in March.
    This revision is dated August 25, 1988.

    John Lear is a Lockheed L-1011 captain for a major US airline and
    has flown over 160 different types of aircraft in over 50
    different countries.  He holds 17 world speed records in the Lear
    Jet and is the only pilot ever to hold every airman certificate
    issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.  Mr. Lear has flown
    missions worldwide for the CIA and other government agencies. A
    former Nevada State Senator candidate, he is the son of William P.
    Lear, designer of the Lear Jet, the 8-track stereo and founder of
    Lear Seigler Corporation.  Lear became interested in UFO's in the
    summer of 1986 after talking with United States Air Force
    personnel who had witnessed a UFO landing at Bentwaters Air Force
    Base, near London, England, and three small aliens walking up to
    Wing Commander General Gordon Williams.





                                                   August 25, 1988

                            THE UFO COVERUP
                                  by
                               John Lear

    The sun does not revolve around the earth.
    The United States government has been in business with little gray
    extraterrestrials for about 20 years.

    The first truth state here got Giordano Bruno burned at the stake
    in 1600 for daring to propose it was real.  The second truth has
    gotten far more people killed trying to state it publicly than
    will ever be known.

    But the truth must be told.  The fact that the earth revolves
    around the sun was successfully suppressed by the church for over
    200 years.  It eventually caused a major upheaval in the church,
    government and thought.  A realignment of social and traditional
    values.  That was in the 1800's.

    Now, about 400 years after the first truth was pronounced we must
    again face the shocking facts.  The "horrible truth" the
    government has been hiding from us for over 40 years.
    Unfortunately, the "horrible truth" is far more horrible than the
    government has imagined.

    In its effort to protect democracy our government sold us to the
    aliens.  And here is how it happened.  But before I begin I'd like
    to offer a word in the defense of those who bargained us away.
    They had the best of intentions.

    Germany may have recovered a flying saucer in 1939.  General James
    H. Doolittle went to Sweden in 1946 to investigate reports of
    "ghost rockets" (UFO's), thousands of which had been sighted over
    a seven month period.

    The "horrible truth" was known by only a very few persons; they
    were indeed ugly little creatures, shaped like praying mantises
    and were more advanced than us by perhaps a billion years.  Of the
    original group that were the first to learn the "horrible truth"
    several committed suicide, the most prominent of which was Defense
    Secretary James V. Forrestal, who jumped to his death from a 16th-
    story hospital window.  Secretary Forrestal's medical records are
    sealed to this day.

    President Truman quickly put a lid on the secret and turned the
    screws so tight that the general public still thinks that flying
    saucers are a joke.  Have I ever got a surprise for them.

    In 1947 President Truman established a group of 12 twelve top
    military and scientific personnel of their time.  They were known
    as MJ-12.  Although the group exists today, none of the original
    members are still alive.  The last one to die was Gordon Gray,
    former Secretary of the Army, in 1984.  As each member passed
    away, the group itself appointed a new member to fill the
    position.  There is some speculation that the group known as
    MJ-12 expanded to at least several more members.

    There were several more saucer crashes in the late 1940's: one in
    Roswell, Mew Mexico; one in Aztec, New Mexico; and one near
    Laredo, Texas, about 30 miles inside the Mexican border.

    Consider if you will the position of the United States government
    at that time.  They proudly thought of themselves as the most
    powerful nation on earth, having recently produced the atomic
    bomb, an achievement so stupendous that it would take Russia four
    years to catch up and only with the help of traitors to democracy.
    They had built a jet aircraft that had exceeded the speed of sound
    in flight.  They had built jet bombers with intercontinental range
    that could carry weapons of enormous destruction.  The post-war
    era had brought economic prosperity and the future seemed bright.
    Now imagine what it was like for those same leaders, all of whom
    had witnessed the panic of Orson Welle's radio broadcast of "The
    War of the Worlds" in 1938.  Thousands of Americans panicked at a
    realistically presented invasion of earth by beings from another
    planet.  Imagine their horror as they actually viewed the dead
    bodies of these frightening-looking little creatures with enormous
    eyes, reptilian skin and claw-like fingers.  Imagine their shock
    as they attempted to determine how these strange saucers were
    powered and could discover no part even remotely similar to
    components they were familiar with: no cylinders and pistons, no
    vacuum tubes or turbines or hydraulic actuators.  It is only when
    you fully understand the overwhelming helplessness the government
    was faced with in the late 40's that you can comprehend their
    perceived need for a total, thorough and sweeping cover-up to
    include the use of "deadly force."

    The cover-up was so successful that as late as 1985 a senior
    scientist with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Dr. Al Hibbs, would
    look at videotape of an enormous saucer and state for the record,
    "I'm not going to assign anything to that (UFO) phenomena without
    a lot more data."  Dr. Hibbs was looking at the naked emperor and
    saying, "He certainly looks naked, but that doesn't prove he is
    naked."

    In July of 1952 a panicked government watched helplessly as
    squadrons of "flying saucers" flew over Washington, D.C., and
    buzzed the White House, the Capitol Building and the Pentagon.  It
    took all the imagination and intimidation the government could
    muster to force that incident out of the memory of the public.

    Thousands of sightings occurred during the Korean War and several
    more saucers were retrieved by the Air Force.  Some were stored at
    Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, some were stored at Air Force
    Bases near the location of the crash sites.

    One saucer was so enormous and the logistical problems in
    transportation so enormous that it was buried at the crash site
    and remains there today.

    The stories are legendary on transporting crashed saucers over
    long distances, moving only at night, purchasing complete farms,
    slashing through forests, blocking major highways, sometimes
    driving two and three low-boys in tandem with an extraterrestrial
    load a hundred feet in diameter.

    On April 25, 1964, the first official communication between these
    aliens and the U.S. government took place at Hollomon Air Force
    Base in New Mexico.  Three saucers landed at a pre-arranged area
    and a meeting was held between the aliens and intelligence
    officers of the U.S. government.

    During the late 60's or early 70's MJ-12, representing the U.S.
    government, made a deal with these creatures called EBE's (extra-
    terrestrial biological entities, named by Detley Bronk, original
    MJ-12 member and sixth president of Johns Hopkins University).
    The "deal" was that in exchange for "technology" that they would
    provide to us we agreed to "ignore" the abductions that were going
    on and suppress information on the cattle mutilations.  The EBE's
    assured MJ-12 that the abductions (usually lasting about two
    hours) were merely the ongoing monitoring of developing
    civilizations.

    In fact, the purposes for the abductions turned out to be:
         (1)  Insertion of a 3mm spherical device through the nasal
              cavity of the abductee into the brain.  The device is
              used for the biological monitoring, tracking and control
              of the abductee.
         (2)  Implementation of post-hypnotic suggestion to carry out
              a specific activity during a specific time period, the
              actuation of which will occur within the next two to
              five years.
         (3)  Termination of some people so that they could function
              as sources of biological materials and substances.
         (4)  Termination of individuals who represent a threat to the
              continuation of their activity.
         (5)  Effect genetic engineering experiments.
         (6)  Impregnation of human females and early termination of
              pregnancies to secure the crossbred infant.

    The U.S. government was not initially aware of the far-reaching
    consequences of their "deal."  They were led to believe that the
    abductions were essentially benign and since they figured the
    abductions would probably go on anyway whether or not they agreed,
    they merely insisted that a current list of abductees be
    submitted, on a periodic basis, to MJ-12 and the National Security
    Council.  Does this sound incredible?  An actual list of abductees
    sent to the National Security Council?  Read on, because I have
    news for you.

    The EBE's have a genetic disorder in that their digestive system
    is atrophied and not functional.  Some speculate that they were
    involved in some type of accident or nuclear war, or that they are
    possibly on the back side of an evolutionary genetic curve.  In
    order to sustain themselves, they use an enzyme or hormonal
    secretion obtained from the tissue they extract from humans and
    animals.  (Note: Cows and humans are genetically similar.  In the
    event of a national disaster cow hemoglobin can be used by
    humans.)

    The secretions obtained are then mixed with hydrogen peroxide and
    applied on their skin by spreading or dipping parts of their
    bodies in the solution.  The body absorbs the solution and then
    excretes the waste back out through the skin.  The cattle
    mutilations, prevalent throughout the period 1973-1983 and
    publicly noted through newspaper and magazine stories and a
    documentary produced by Linda Howe for the Denver CBS affiliate
    KMGH, were for the collection of these tissues by the aliens.  The
    mutilations included genitals taken, rectums cored out to the
    colon, eyes, tongue and throat all surgically removed with extreme
    precision.  In some cases the incisions were made by cutting
    between the cells, a process we are not yet capable of performing
    the field.  In many of the mutilations there was no blood found at
    all in the carcasses, yet there was no vascular collapse of the
    internal organs.

    This has also been noted in human mutilations.  One of the first
    known mutilations was of Sgt. Jonathon P. Louette. His remains
    were discovered at the White Sands Missile Test Range in 1956,
    three days after an Air Force Major witnessed his abduction by a
    "disk-shaped" object at 0300 while on a search for missile debris
    downrange.  His genitals has been removed, rectum cored out in a
    surgically precise "plug" up to the colon, eyes removed and all
    blood removed, again, with no vascular collapse.  From some of the
    evidence it is apparent that this surgery is accomplished, in most
    cases, while the victim, animal or human, is still alive.

    The various parts of the body are taken to various underground
    laboratories, one of which is known to be near the small New
    Mexico town of Dulce.  This jointly occupied (CIA-alien) facility
    has been described as enormous, with huge tiles that "go on
    forever."  Witnesses have reported huge vats filled with an amber
    liquid with parts of human bodies being stirred inside.

    After the initial agreement, Groom Lake, one of this nation's most
    secret test centers, was closed for a period of about a year
    sometime between 1972 and 1974, and a huge underground facility
    was constructed for and with the help of the EBE's.  The
    bargained-for technology was set in place but could only be
    operated by the EBE's themselves.  Needless to say, the advanced
    technology could not be used against the EBE's.

    During the period 1979-1983 it became increasingly obvious to
    MJ-12 that things were not going as planned.  It became known that
    many more people (in the thousands) were being abducted than were
    listed on the official abduction reports.  In addition, it became
    obvious that some, not all, but some of the nation's missing
    children had been used for secretions and other parts required by
    the aliens.

    According to some, there was an altercation between the U.S.
    military and the aliens at the Dulce laboratory.  A special armed
    forces unit was called in to try and free a number of our people
    trapped in the facility who had become aware of what was really
    going on.  According to one source, 66 of the soldiers were killed
    in the effort.

    By 1983, MJ-12 must have been in stark terror at the mistake they
    had made in dealing with the EBE's.  They had subtly influenced
    (through Dr. Hynek, formerly with the Blue Book project, who had
    allegedly broken ties with the Air Force in the late 60's but who
    in reality continued to be their informant in his cover capacity
    as Director of the Center for UFO Studies) "Close Encounters of
    the Third Kind" and "E.T." (now admitted by some members of MJ-12
    to have been a "drastic mistake") to get the public used to "odd-
    looking" aliens that were compassionate, benevolent and very much
    our "space brothers."  MJ-12 had, in effect, "sold" the EBE's to
    the public, and were now faced with the fact that quite the
    opposite was true.  In addition, a plan had been formulated in
    1968 to make the public aware of the existence of aliens on earth
    over the next 20 years, to be culminated with several
    documentaries to be released during the 1985-1987 period.  These
    documentaries would explain the history and intentions of the
    EBE's.  The discovery of the "Grand Deception" put the entire
    plans, hopes and dreams of MJ-12 into utter confusion and panic.

    Meeting at the "Country Club," a remote lodge with private golf
    course, comfortable sleeping and working quarters and its own
    private airstrip built by and exclusively for the members of MJ-12,
    it was a factional fight of what to do now.  Part of MJ-12, which
    had now become military top-heavy, wanted to confess the whole
    scheme and the shambles it had become to the public, beg their
    forgiveness and ask for their support.  The other part (and
    majority) of MJ-12 argued that there was no way they could do
    that, that the situation was untenable and there was no use in
    exciting the public with the "horrible truth" and that the best
    plan was to continue the development of a weapon or "plan of
    containment" that could be used against the EBE's under the guise
    of "SDI," the so-called Strategic Defense Initiative, which has
    nothing whatever to do with a defense for inbound Russian nuclear
    missiles.  In fact, the real definition of purpose for SDI reads
    "the plotting, tracking and acquisition of articles in deep
    space."  As these words are being written, Dr. Edward Teller,
    "father" of the H-bomb is personally in the nuclear test tunnels
    of the Nevada Test Site, driving his workers and associates in the
    words of one, "like a man possessed."  And well he should be, for
    Dr. Teller is a member of MJ-12, along with Henry Kissinger,
    Admiral Bobby Inman, and General Lew Allen.

    Before the "Grand Deception" was discovered, in following the plan
    of metered release of information to the public, several
    documentaries and videotapes were made.  William Moore, a Burbank,
    California-based UFO researcher who wrote "The Roswell Incident,"
    a book published in 1980 that detailed the crash, recovery and
    subsequent cover-up of a UFO with four alien bodies, has a
    videotape of two newsmen interviewing a military officer
    associated with MJ-12.  This military officer answers questions
    relating to the history of MJ-12 and the cover-up, the recovery of
    a number of flying saucers, and the existence of a live alien (one
    of three living aliens captured and designated EBE-1, EBE-2 and
    EBE-3, being held in a facility designated as YY-II at Los Alamos,
    New Mexico.  The only other facility of this type, which is
    electromagnetically secure, is at Edwards Air Force Base in
    Mojave, California).  The officer names names as previously
    mentioned plus a few others:  Harold Brown, Richard Helms, General
    Vernon Walters and Dr. Theodore von Karman, as being members of
    MJ-12.


    The officer also relates the fact that the EBE's claim to have
    created Christ.  The EBE's have a type of recording device that
    has recorded all of earth's history and can display it in the form
    of a hologram.  This hologram can be filmed but because of the way
    holograms work, it does not come out very clear on film or
    videotape.  The crucifixion of Christ on the Mount of Olives has
    allegedly been put on film to show the public.  The EBE's claim to
    have created Christ, which, in view of the "Grand Deception,"
    could be an effort to disrupt traditional values for undetermined
    reasons.

    Another videotape allegedly in existence is an interview with an
    EBE.  Since EBE's communicate telepathically an Air Force colonel
    serves as an interpreter.  Just before the recent stock market
    crash, several newsmen, including Bill Moore, had been invited to
    Washington, D.C., to personally film the EBE in a similar type
    interview and distribute the film to the public.  Apparently,
    because of the market crash, it was felt that the timing was not
    propitious.  In any case, it certainly seems like an odd method to
    inform the pubic of extraterrestrials, but it would be in keeping
    with the actions of a panicked organization, who at this point
    didn't know which way to turn.

    Moore is also in possession of more Aquarius documents, a few
    pages of which leaked out several years ago, detailing the super-
    secret NSA project which had been denied by them until just
    recently.  In a letter to Senator John Glenn, NSA's Director of
    Policy, Julia B. Wetzel, wrote, "Apparently there is or was an Air
    Force project by that name [Aquarius] which dealt with UFO's.
    Coincidentally, there is also an NSA project by that name."  NSA's
    Project Aquarius deals specifically with "communications with
    aliens."  Within the Aquarius program was Project Snowbird, a
    project to test fly a recovered alien aircraft at Groome Lake,
    Nevada.  This project continues today at that location.  In the
    words of an individual who works at Groom Lake "our people are
    much better at taking things apart than they are at putting them
    back together."  Another saw a saucer being trucked into the
    Nevada Test Site in March of 1988.  Still another informant
    witnessed a saucer being buried at that location during the second
    week of August, 1988.

    If the government felt they were being forced to acknowledge the
    existence of aliens on earth because of the overwhelming evidence,
    such as the Hudson Valley sightings during the past four years,
    the Wytheville, Virginia, sightings in October and November of
    1987, the Gulf Breeze, Florida sightings in which documentary
    evidence in the form of stereoscopic photographs and videotape
    were taken between November of 1987 and May of 1988, the Lake
    Superior sightings of 1988 and the sightings in and around Las
    Vegas, Nevada and the Nevada Test Site, and taking into
    consideration the "Grand Deception" and obviously hostile intent
    of the EBE's, it might be expedient for MJ-12 to admit to the
    EBE's existence but conceal the information on the abductions and
    mutilations of humans and animals.

    The enormity of the problem must be driving more than a few "at
    the top" to drink.  But what about the rest of us?  Most of those
    reporting sightings are being viciously ridiculed by government-
    sponsored "debunkers" like Philip Klass, former avionics editor
    for "Aviation Week" and "Space Technology," NASA scientist James
    Oberg, and a host of others.  When the truth does emerge, if it
    ever does, how is this shabby, dishonest treatment of totally
    sane, normal and patriotic citizens going to be justified?

    Now you ask, "Why haven't I heard about any of this?"  Who do you
    think you would hear it from?  Dan Rather?  Tom Brokaw?  Sam
    Donaldson?  Wrong.  These people just read the news.  They don't
    find it.  They have ladies that call and interview witnesses and
    verify statements on stories coming over the wire.  It's not like
    Dan Rather would go down to Wytheville, Virginia, and dig into why
    there were 4000 reports of sightings in October and November of
    1987.  Better that Tom Brokaw or someone else should risk their
    credibility on this type of story.  Tom Brokaw?  He wants Sam
    Donaldson to risk his credibility.  No one... but no one is going
    to risk their reputation on such outlandish ideas regardless of
    how many people report sightings of 900-foot objects running them
    off the road.  In the case of the Wytheville, Virginia, sightings,
    dozens of vans with "NASA" lettered on the sides failed to
    interest newsmen.  And those that did ask questions were told that
    NASA was doing a weather survey.

    Well, then, you ask:  What about out scientists... what about Carl
    Sagan?  Isaac Asimov?  Arthur C. Clarke?  Wouldn't they have
    known?  If Carl Sagan knows, then he is committing a great fraud
    through the solicitation of memberships in the Planetary Society
    "to search for extraterrestrial intelligence."  Another charade
    into which the U.S. government dumps millions of dollars every
    year is the radiotelescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, operated by
    Cornell University with, guess who, Carl Sagan.  Cornell
    University is ostensibly searching for signals from outer space, a
    sign, maybe, that someone is out there.  It's hard to believe that
    relatively intelligent astronomers like Sagan could be so stupid.

    What about Isaac Asimov?  Surely the most prolific science fiction
    writer of all time would have guessed by now that there must be an
    enormous cover-up.

    One current hypothesis is that, from the available evidence, it
    appears that the EBE's are trying to regenerate their own species
    at our expense.  They have apparently suffered either some kind of
    nuclear holocaust or they may be on the back side of a bell-shaped
    evolutionary curve where in essence they are "devolving" instead
    of evolving.  In any case, according to reports of several
    autopsies of aliens that have leaked out, the EBE's have an
    atrophied digestive system and other physical problems.  This
    would account for their attempts to crossbreed with us as outlined
    in "Intruders" by Budd Hopkins, a detailed study of an
    Indianapolis woman who, over several years, produces seven
    crossbreed alien children, none of whom she was allowed to keep.
    Not that she wanted to.

    Whatever the answer these facts are indisputable.  The extent and
    number of persons reported missing every year is a closely guarded
    government secret.  (Since 1980, at least 20,000 children have
    been reported missing each year.)  Cattle mutilations (over 14,000
    since 1973) are regarded officially by the government as a "hoax."
    Human abductions by aliens are officially regarded by the
    government as a "hoax."  The latest polls show that 88% of all
    Americans believe that intelligent life on other planets is
    probable and that over 20 million Americans have seen what they
    believed to be a UFO.  But the U.S. government officially
    dismisses "flying saucers" as a "hoax."  What do you think?

    The best advice I can give you is next time you see a flying
    saucer and are awed by its obvious display of technology and
    gorgeous lights of pure color:

                               RUN LIKE HELL!
