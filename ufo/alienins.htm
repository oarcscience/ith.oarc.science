                     Alien Insurance Pays Off

                         By DAVID WALMSEY
                             in London


    IT could be the perfect case for agents Mulder and Scully.

    In true X-Files style, an electrician claims he was lifted from
  the ground and knocked unconscious by a UFO near London.

    He is apparently to be paid $2 million by insurers who covered
  him against abduction by aliens.  Industry sources, however, are
  suggesting that the payout could, just possibly, be an out-of-
  this-world publicity stunt.

    The story starts on October 8 when Joseph Carpenter, 23, of
  North London, claims he was struck down by a mystery light at
  Swindon.

    The area is a "hot spot" for such phenomena, says Mr Carpenter,
  who runs a UFO hunting group called the Majestic Twelve.

    "On the evening in question, an intense beam of light, like a
  police helicopter, had me," he said.

    "The anti-gravity force within it lifted me above the ground.
  I passed out as I went directly into it.  All this was captured on
  film."

    By an amazing stroke of luck, Mr Carpenter had paid $205 for
  cover against such an eventuality to a company called GRIP, run by
  insurance broker Simon Burgess.

    Mr Carpenter was able to produce "compelling evidence" of his
  ordeal, including camcorder footage, witnesses and DNA samples
  taken from what he said was a claw found at the scene.

    Mr Burgess said last night: "The work on the DNA sample was
  carried out by a research fellow at Cambridge University -- I
  can't give you the name.  But the work proved conclusively that
  the sample was something that had never been seen before and which
  was not of this Earth."

    Mr  Burgess says Mr Carpenter was expected to receive his $2
  million yesterday at a London hotel from Scully herself, _X-Files_
  star Gillian Anderson.

    The broker, described by one industry source as "an unhelpful
  maverick", is believed to have made a deal with a Sunday paper for
  exclusive coverage of the presentation.

    Industry insiders say he is almost certain to make a profit from
  Mr Carpenter's claim.

    One said: "If he plays his cards right, he will claw the money
  back by wisely selling the world rights of the video evidence to
  TV companies.  If he co-wrote a book using the evidence, the money
  would also roll in."
