    Things to beware of in 1997:

    Sudden outbreaks of hostility, racial and otherwise, which seem to 
    just as suddenly be quelled.  Some may notice a fine drizzlelike
    mist preceding these events.

    : DOGON.UFO

    Not many people are familiar with the Dogon people, who live in the West
    African country of Mali. About 90 percent of Mali's population is Muslim,
    but the Dogon, who comprise about 4 percent of the Mali's population, are
    among the few people who continue to maintain traditional African religious
    practices and beliefs. I remember watching a television documentary about
    the Dogon a few years back which discussed their cosmology. I thought it was
    intriguing, but did not give the matter any attention after that.

    Recently, I was browsing through a coffee-table book called "Strange Amazing
    and Mysterious Places" (Collins Publishers, 1993). It's mostly nice for the
    beautiful photographs taken from around the world. But it also contains a
    brief essay on the Dogon, most of which I've reprinted. Here it is:

    "The Dogon live in the remote Hombori mountains of southern Mali. Their land
    is arid, their life is hard, and their farming methods are those of Iron
    Age. Their myths, on the other hand, are entirely Space Age.

    "In their most secret religious teachings the Dogon record a curious story
    of visitors from another star system. The star people, called Nommos, and
    also the Instructors, came down to earth in a spinning ship. It made a great
    noise and wind and spurted blood when it landed. Something came out of the
    ship: it had four legs and dragged the ship to a hollow. The hollow filled
    with water and then the Nommos came out. They looked more like fish than
    humans, and they needed to stay in water. These Nommos were saviors and
    guardians for all of human kind. They gave advice. They gave their bodies
    for men to eat, and in the end they were crucified and will return to earth
    again one day with human bodies.

    "All this might be nothing more than one of the world's peculiar creation
    myths, which teem with beings visiting the earth from other worlds. But
    there is a difference: the Dogon's story is constructed around precise
    mathematical information about th star system the Nommos came from, near the
    bright star Sirius. The Nommos said that Sirius had a small companion star.
    It was white in color, very small, and immensely heavy. It rotated on its
    own axis and made an elliptical orbit of Sirius once every fifty years. All
    this is precisely true.

    "Until fairly recently, Western astronomers knew nothing about a white dwarf
    star circling around Sirius. They first suspected that Sirius might have
    such a companion in 1844, when small disturbances in the star's movement
    were detected. Then, in 1928, astronomers understood that although Sirius'
    companion is very small (it is classed technically as a white swarf and is
    called Sirius B), it is composed of extremely dense matter and therefore has
    enough mass to explain the effects. In 1970 the first photographs of the
    star were taken. The star's orbit, as the Dogon say, is elliptical and is
    completed in 50.04 years--a little more than two weeks longer than the Dogon
    predict.

    "Astronomers admit that the kind of knowledge the Dogon have about Sirius
    can only be obtained with advanced telescopes, which the Dogon have never
    possessed. They attempt to account for the Dogon's knowledge by a series of
    rationalizations. Sometime after 1928, a Westerner with a compulsion to
    impart obscure knowledge must have visited the tribe and told them about the
    discovery of Sirius' satellite. Then, just for the pleasure of confounding
    the French anthropologist who collected the stories in 1934, the Dogon
    claimed they had the information for centuries, and that it had been given
    to them by fish-like people from the stars. Even more ingenuously, the Dogon
    seem to have remembered a very ancient Babylonian story and modeled their
    ridiculous tale of the Nommos on it. This story, recorded in the 3rd century
    B.C., tells how an egg-shaped vehicle landed in the Red Sea, and how out of
    it came an amphibious people called the Oannes. They looked terrible--half
    fish and half human--but they gave the people all the information needed to
    become civilized."

    Interesting, isn't it?

    The next posting on this subject concerns my reading of an original Dogon
    source, first published in 1948: "Conversations with Ogotemmeli."
