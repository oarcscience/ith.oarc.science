### Area 51 FAQ

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AREA 51 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
    Answered by the Area 51 Research Center, 10/12/96

    For extensive Area 51 information see: https://www.ufomind.com/area51

    WHAT IS AREA 51?

    "Area 51" is a block of government land about 95 miles north of Las
    Vegas.  It is surrounded by the Nevada Test Site and the Nellis Air Force
    Range.  The name "Area 51" supposedly came from a designation appearing
    on an old map of the Nevada Test Site.  Inside Area 51 is a large Air
    Force base, near the shore of Groom Dry Lake, that the government does
    not talk about.  The airspace around the base is off-limits even to most
    military pilots and has been referred to on aviation frequencies as
    "Dreamland."

    WHAT IS THE FUNCTION OF THE GROOM LAKE BASE?

    The base at Groom Lake has traditionally been America's testing ground
    for the latest generation of secret aircraft.  The U-2, A-12, SR-71 and
    F-117A were flight tested here long before being made public.  Since the
    government won't acknowledge anything about the base, it's hard to be
    know what is going on there now.  Common rumors suggest several possible
    new aircraft, including an ultra-high speed spy plane dubbed "Aurora" by
    aviation watches, various unmanned aerial reconnaisance vehicles (UAVs),
    stealth helicopters and a possible replacement for the F-117A.  The
    existance of these projects is speculative, however, and most activities
    at Groom are probably more mundane weapons and systems testing, of
    interest only to hard-core military buffs.

    WHAT'S WITH THE UFOS?

    This area has long been rich in UFO lore.  Whatever you can
    imagine--captured aliens, underground bases, alien-government
    collusion--it's all been claimed at Groom Lake.  One of the more
    restrained and interesting stories is the claim by a Las Vegan, Bob
    Lazar, that he worked with extraterrestrial flying saucers at an
    installation at Papoose Lake, south of Groom Lake, in an area he calls
    "S-4."  He says he helped "reverse engineer" one of the craft, but that
    he saw no aliens himself. There seems to be no way to confirm or directly
    refute this claim, although Lazar's claimed educational credentials
    certainly are not real.

    Since Lazar first made his claims in televised interviews, many tourists
    have been coming to the public lands closest to the base to try to catch
    glimpses of alien craft in flight.  Many believe that they have seen UFOs
    here, but there are so many UFO-like natural and military phenomena on
    display here that its hard to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Many
    people have lived in this area all their lives and never seen a UFO,
    while tourists coming for only one night often claim to see them
    everywhere.  It is important to note the difference between the claim
    that the government has alien spacecraft in its possession and the claim
    that you can come here to see flying saucers on demand.  Even if you
    believe the first, it doesn't necessarily imply the second.

    WHERE DO WATCHERS GO?

    About 130 miles from Las Vegas, at Mile Marker LN 29.5 on remote Nevada
    Highway 375, is a lone mailbox used by a local rancher.  Since the "Black
    Mailbox" (now a white mailbox) is the only landmark on this stretch of
    the highway, this is where the true believers come.  Many visitors claim
    to have seen flying saucer here, although the rancher himself claims to
    have seen none.  There is a lot of intense military war games activity in
    this area that produces a lot of flares and other interesting lights in
    the sky--great "UFOs" if you want to see them.

    There used to be two viewpoints on public land close to the border--
    White Sides and Freedom Ridge--where a visitor could legally view the
    secret Air Force base.  These areas were closed by the Air Force in April
    1995.  You can still see the base from a distant mountain, Tikaboo Peak,
    but it requires a strenuous 1-1/2 hour hike from a remote dirt road.

    WHAT ARE THE "CAMMO DUDES"?

    That's the nickname for the anonymous private security force that patrols
    the military border.  They wear camouflage fatigues without insignia and
    drive white Jeep Cherokees with government plates.  They keep close watch
    on any visitors that come within a few miles of the border, but they are
    under orders to avoid contact.  Since you can't easily see the base
    itself, the Cammo Dudes are one of the few reliable tourist attractions.

    WHAT ARE THE DANGERS OF VISITING THIS AREA?

    The greatest danger is wandering across the unfenced military border,
    which would result in your immediate arrest and a fine of $600. Wherever
    a road crosses the border, it is marked by clear "Restricted Area" signs
    which should not be crossed.  In the desert, the border is marked by
    orange posts every 50 yards.  It is unwise to hike near the border unless
    you are certain of the location of the border.  It is even worse to hike
    at night because the posts become invisible.

    Another major danger, when driving, is getting stuck on an remote,
    unmaintained dirt road that your vehicle cannot handle.  To get stuck in
    the sand and then run out of water can be deadly.
