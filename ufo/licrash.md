    An excerpt from a private message  on April 13, 1994

    Subject: Crashed Hard Disk

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    I have some very interesting news.  I don't know if I mentioned to you that on
    November 24, 1992 a UFO apparently crashed out in Long Island at a place called
    South Haven Park, not far from the Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The area
    was cordoned off for four days with black suited Swat teams blocking all access
    to the area.

    The object was removed to BNL but someone there leaked some video which
    appeared on the Fox News Network special aired about two months ago. I have
    learned that a gov't worker who opposes the cover-up leaked the tape to Fox
    News but another piece exists which was not aired.  The unaired segment
    purportedly shows alien artifacts (bodies) and is in the possession of a group
    out in Long Island with whom I have made contact in the last few days.  I saw
    some crude video capture polaroids of the forms and it has sparked my
    curiousity.

    LATE BREAKING NEWS ON THE SOUTH HAVEN PARK CRASH & COVERUP

    Members of several UFO investigation organizations will be represented the
    weekend of May 13th-15th at a regional science-fiction convention in Columbus,
    Ohio. LIUFON, PRO, PIC, and others will be coming to Marcon 29 to present a
    forum on recent developments in the area of alien interaction with the
    occupants of Terra. Many other topics will also be covered during the Marcon
    weekend.

    Seminars will be held on government coverups including Grooms Lake/Area 51, UFO
    crashes, physical evidence, & congressional inquiry into events in Roswell; as
    well as data on recent alien abductions including physical types & psychology
    of alien races, effects on the abductees and anectdotes of personal encounters.

    A prominent UFOlogist from The Long Island UFO Network will present and narrate
    a 2-1/2 hour slide/video show on the "SMOKING GUN" evidence that is the
    "BEGINNING OF THE END" of the UFO coverup. This is the video that was too
    startling to be show on NBC's Unsolved Mysteries, and includes considerable
    footage not included in the broadcast done by The Fox Network. Suffice to say
    that in total this is evidence that has never been seen anywhere else.

    This show will consist of slides & video footage of the aftermath of the
    Nov.'92 explosion and crash of a mothership & six escape pods over Southhaven
    Park in Yaphank, Long Island NY. This is supported by photo, video & physical
    evidence.

    The video will show close-ups of the crash sites and efforts by "men in black"
    to clear the sites. Included is onsite footage of the retrieval of discernable
    dead extraterrestrial bodies, debris from crashed escape pods & structural
    wreckage near Brookhaven National Laboratories. At one point in the video, you
    can even see an ET head passing less than 8" away from the lens.

    You will be able to decide for yourself why this startling evidence hasn't been
    able to be shown. Don't miss the definitive evidence in the ultimate
    controversy.

    Single day memberships will be available at the convention. For more
    information about Marcon 29, see the file  "MARCON PR3" (marcon.txt or
    marcon.zip) in the forum library.
