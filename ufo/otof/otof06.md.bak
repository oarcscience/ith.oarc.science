### CHAPTER 2

### THE GRAND MAN

In the Universe of infinite entities and infinite variety, Man is found
manifesting in many degrees from Microcosm to Macrocosm. In the theory
of Paracelsus, the Microcosm was man, as if combining in himself all the
elements of the Macrocosm or great world. This theory in turn reminds us
of Swedenborg who spoke and wrote so often about the Creator as *The
Grand Man* of the Omniverse containing all the elements of the
Microcosmic world. From the smallest unit of Creation to the most
gigantic, there is a spiraling, circular progression. Early explorers
went West to get East; and so in the Microcosmic world lies the answer
to what the Macrocosmos is like.

Darwin said: "An organic being is a Microcosm, a little Universe, formed
of a host of self-propagating organisms, inconceivably minute and
numerous as the stars in heaven."

A. Bronson Alcott, in 1877 said: "Matter in particle and planet, mind
and macrocosm, is quick with spirit."

So, we find matter manifesting and vibrating from minute to the
monumental in various degrees, but SPIRIT permeates through all! In the
great world of the Macrocosmos is it not logical and entirely possible
that there may exist worlds so large in comparison with ours that their
individual total

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

masses may be millions upon millions of times that of Earth? And, if we
grant that, is it not reasonable to say that in the small world of the
Microcosmos we will find the direct opposite? In other words, atomic
worlds containing real intelligent beings who live, work and love even
as we?

For some time now scientists have been well aware of the fact that there
is a Universal pattern of form in the minute that is duplicated exactly
in the colossal of Creation!

Space visitors have said: "It is not right that man should destroy his
brother by utilizing the powerful forces of atomic energy, but the
destruction you witness is minor, indeed, compared to the enormity of
[chaos](errata.htm#6.md) created in the Microcosmos by the release of such
energy!" When an atomic bomb is detonated, literal Microcosmic worlds
containing created life are destroyed. Of course, these worlds are in
other dimensions of time and space: what we think of as a minute may be
the passing of a million years to the Microcosmic citizen.

Infinity covers a lot of "territory", and we can easily have worlds and
life so minute that we aver-age five-foot eighters cannot possibly see
them with our organs of sight. If we accept this fact, we must also
agree that there must be bigger worlds and bigger life forms. In fact,
these forms could be so large that we couldn't possibly see them . . .
and that brings us back to the Microcosmos.

In considering the present space visitations to Earth, we encounter
Saucer occupants similar to

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

ourselves in size and form. We do not find spacemen coming into Earth's
atmosphere landing their craft on a pin head or Saucer pilots so large
that they displace all the water in the Atlantic Ocean if they decide to
take a dip. The reason certain space people are here and not other
inhabitants of the Cosmos is because our Infinite Father has sent those
brothers to us who are most nearly like ourselves in appearance and
bodily size. After all, contact is difficult enough in a corporeal world
without adding to the problem by sending a highly developed being who
would have to announce the Universal doctrine to us from that pin-head
or lovingly lead us like a Swift in [Lilliput](errata.htm#7.md)! The space
friends here now may be far ahead of us in spiritual development, but
they are probably more nearly like us than other dwellers in the Cosmos.

Before the consideration of similarities existing between matter and
energy from the sub-atomic (microcosmic) through the astronomical
(macro-cosmic) levels is discussed, it is important to conceive of what
matter and energy are. Very recently, it was taught in our universities
that most of the atom as well as most of the starry Universe was *empty*
space. Now, finally, physicists are uncovering the facts that show
matter and energy to be the same thing, though they cannot really
understand how such a situation can exist. Their facts confuse their
theories and they find themselves forced into retaining theories they
now know to be inconsistent with the facts, for lack of any better
theories.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

*Empty space* is a dead concept, for where is there no starlight? Yes,
even starlight is matter and exerts pressure. Science has discovered
that the famous little particle called an *electron* sometimes exhibits
itself more as a particle and sometimes more as a wave. This is true
also of the other so-called particles of the atom and of the Universe.

A particle can be an electron, other atomic particles, an atom, a moon,
a planet, a sun, a solar system, a galaxy, a super-galaxy, and so on, ad
infinitum. All creations (particles) in the Universe are similar
because:

\(1\) All of them discharge energy. This might be considered as
reference to fields of force; emission of rays; waves; frequencies;
vibrations and forces. Briefly then, how can one picture something
having both *particle* and *wave* properties at the same time? It is
done by thinking of them as shells within shells. Some of these shells
are visible to the eye as the Earth's crust, the layers of an onion, the
skin of the body, or the "wheels within wheels" of Saucers. Some are
visible with instruments which have determined the wave nature of
electrons and other particles which emit quanta of energy. Some are
detected by special photography as the four known fields of vibration
around the human body and the atomic and molecular structures of various
crystalline bodies as obtained by the British physicist, W. L. Bragg.
The kind of motion that these shells exhibit, determines what the effect
of that energy is to be. Heat, for example, is a wave pattern

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

made up of a series of particles given off in quanta by an electron. It
might be called pure energy moving with a *peculiar* kind of motion. The
nature of the motion determines the effect produced, which can be any of
the following: Nonvisible light; visible light measured as heat, or cold
light. Remember that visibility and invisibility and the sensations of
heat and cold are only sensations of the physical structure. Thus the
real meaning of the term light is far beyond what is visible to the
eyes. The term light is used to designate the wave nature of all matter,
its energy and its motion.

\(2\) In order for bodies continually to discharge energy they must
continually absorb a new supply of energy. Thus the Universe consists of
constant interchange of energy resulting in:

\(3\) A perpetual rhythmic expansion and contraction. For example, it is
only possible for comets to travel at their terrific speeds for long
periods of time because they are constantly replenishing their energy
through their tail, and this energy is from a sun.

Now let us consider the tremendous likenesses exhibited by primary
bodies beginning with the smallest we can detect, the sub-atomic:

Sub-atomic particles (and when we say particle, we must think of
particle-wave for the two concepts are inseparable in speaking of basic
structure) are to be considered in this discussion as particles that
science can know only indirectly by their behavior Thus, heat energy
given off by an electron might

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

be comparable to satellites of the electron. Thus the electron gives off
electro-magnetic radiation, which produces effects on varying portions
of the spectrum depending on the kind of motion.

Perhaps these particles are those quanta of electromagnetic radiation
which have been called photons and/or gamma rays. These rays, like
X-rays, are without an electrical charge and are therefore not deflected
in electric or magnetic fields. Gamma rays are electro-magnetic
radiation of *very short* wave length, and high energy. Photons or
energy vary in their velocity and thus energy according to the kind of
radiation to which the matter emitting the photons is subjected.

If the radiation is in the high frequency end of the spectrum, then the
photons will have a higher energy. In other words, the energy of the
photons emitted by an electron subjected to electromagnetic radiation is
related to the energy of the radiation, but the energy *is* emitted in
distinct quanta. Photons are too small to detect experimentally in the
high frequency portion of the spectrum. They are only detected in that
part of the spectrum below visible light.

Photons or gamma rays by interaction with atomic nuclei have been
converted into pairs of electrons and positrons (positively charged
electrons). This materialization is a good example of the equivalence of
matter (mass) and energy.

Scientists have divided the sub-atomic particles into two classes. The
first class consists of particles

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

which *cannot* occupy the same shell or energy level. These include the
proton, electron, positron, neutron, neutrino and mu mesons. The second
class consists of particles which *can* occupy the same energy level.
Photons, gravitons, and pi mesons be-long to this class. The graviton is
the unit of gravitational energy. According to the Unified Field Theory,
gravity is just another aspect of electromagnetism like light, radio
waves and other forms of electro-magnetic radiation.

Professor Vaclav Hlavaty of Indiana University Graduate Institute of
Applied Mathematics recently achieved solutions to mathematical
equations in Einstein's latest Unified Field Theory that revolutionize
our concepts of energy, motion and matter.

Dr. Hlavaty's solutions to the Einstein equations reveal that
electro-magnetism is the basis of the Universe . . . which goes beyond
Einstein's attempt to unify gravitation and electro-magnetism . . . the
twin forces in which he believes the Universe manifests itself. If Dr.
Hlavaty's solution is correct, the basis of all cosmic
forces--gravitation as well as matter and energy--is built up of an
all-pervading, all-embracing mathematical field.

These theories will lead to the discovery of cosmic forces not even
suspected today. [Gravitation](errata.htm#8.md) is not the basis of
everything, but electro-magnetism is. Everything, including man, owes
its existence to its electro-magnetic force field.

So-called gravity is created by the vortex of the particle itself and is
related to the density and also

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

the size of the vortex or electro-magnetic field. Thus the gravity
exhibited by a sub-atomic particle may be greater than suspected at the
present time. It is present as pressure toward the center of the field.
Therefore, one might think of gravity as acting *inward* at right angles
to the energy levels or shells. And to make a broader statement, we
might say that all of the particles of the second class are acting at
right angles to the spherical energy levels or shells, but the photons
act *outward* and are given off as various forms of electro-magnetic
energy. Both photons and gravitons modify the motion of their respective
nuclear body in its role as a satellite to some larger body.

As electrons revolve about atomic nuclei in energy levels, so photons
revolve around electronic nuclei, and when they are subjected to energy
they are emitted as electro-magnetic energy in waves, the effect of
which depends of their motion. For the possible effects glance at a
chart of the electro-magnetic spectrum. The effects may be anywhere from
heat on the far left, through radio waves, infrared, visible light,
ultraviolet, and X-rays, to the high energy gamma rays just before the
section of the spectrum designated secondary cosmic rays.

Gravitons are "particles" acting inward pulling from the center due to
the pressure therein resulting from the expansion and contraction of the
magnetic field which is a field of electrically charged motion. Due to
the particular kind of motion of the electron in the magnetic field, no
sensation of

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

electricity is felt. The latter results when the negatively charged
electrons move through the positively charged solution called
*atmosphere* with a frictional motion. *Atmosphere* as used here, refers
to the electro-magnetic field, not just "air".

". . . The particles that go to make up the ethers can be thought of . .
. as sub-sub-atomic matter . . . and as you 'sub' lower than that we go
out of existence as far as the world of matter measurable is concerned .
. ." (B.S.R.A. Special Report, 10-C-53).

Now let us consider atomic structure!

Although we could probably be more nearly correct if we regarded all the
so-called particles as motion rather than substance, we retain the
physicists terminology in order that those who are acquainted somewhat
with atomic physics can judge for themselves what is stated.

The old classical idea of an atom consisting simply of a positive
nucleus with negative point-like electrons revolving rapidly around it
is now found to be quite inadequate. Also, we are not so certain that
there is a tremendous amount of *empty space* between these entities.
For sub-sub-atomic matter would indicate satellites of satellites to a
micro-infinity separated by the Infinite Light of the Creator, known to
the Qabbalists as *Ain Soph Aur*, the Limitless Light.

The newer theory of wave mechanics envisions the electron as a standing
wave undulating to and fro. When the electron emits energy its energy
level or shell is contracted accordingly. When it

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

absorbs energy the shell is expanded. The apparent mass depends on its
speed. Since the electron rotates, we must now conceive of this
undulating more or less spherical shell rotating or spinning. This
rotation is brought about by the effect of flux set up by the charged
solution in which the electron is found. The rotation brings about
polarity, magnetism, gravity, electricity, etc.

Now, before we leave this discussion of what an electron is, let's
include in our concept what would give rise to this more or less
circular standing wave undulating to and fro. This can also be thought
of as a manifestation of the vortex or electro-magnetic field. This
effect can be pictured by imagining the wave effect of two series of
vertical rows of fish passing uniformly between each other at a
ninety-degree angle and then backing up. Would not this motion in rhythm
give the effect of a spherical undulating wave? In the case of the atom
these waves are produced by parallel lines of force passing between each
other at right angles with a rhythmic "breathing" resulting from the
positive-negative strain. The positive lines of force are composed of
positively charged particles, and the negative lines of force of
negative particles intersect them at right angles forming a flux effect.
This intersection, when the lines are of equal density and vibration,
forms an atom consisting of protons and electrons and an
electro-magnetic field. It is because these two kinds of lines of force
have different speeds that scientists have recently discovered

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

that the speed of light is not constant at 186,000 miles per second.

Several months ago, a naval research engineer said he and four
associates photographed a spot of light moving across a cathode ray tube
at 202,000 miles per second, faster than the recognized speed of light.

Perpendicular to these intersecting lines of force are other parallel
lines of force which extend infinitely throughout all space. These have
an extremely high rate of vibration but no motion as to direction. This
is what is meant by space intelligences when they say: "Light does not
travel . . . light IS!" These lines of force establish polarity and the
resulting effects. They are the creative causation force of the Creative
Intelligence, and the insulating force between successive electron
shells. They make possible creation of new particles and add to the
rotation of particles already existing by spiral induction and partial
penetration.

It is this force which condenses and escapes invisibly as a "neutrino"
when an atom is "split". It is the part of the atom which undergoes a
"resurrection." Physicists discovered the neutrino (which they believe
to have a mass of less than one two-thousandth of the mass of an
electron) from the fact that in the nuclear process of a neutron being
converted into a proton and an electron there was some missing spin
energy. The neutrino was postulated as the carrier of this energy.

It carries no electric charge, but an idea of its

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

character might be more easily grasped by realizing that a beam of
neutrinos would travel through lead of almost infinite thickness with no
decrease in intensity. Indeed, the neutrino, which physicists can't see
as they have seen tracks of other nuclear particles on photographic
film, appears to be the creative light force of the Infinite Father. The
Limitless Light . . . the *Light* that IS! It is the balancing force of
the Omniverse.

In regard to the nucleus of the atom, physicists are considering various
theories, trying to understand what holds its protons and neutrons
together in the nucleus since electrically like forces repel. A
qualitative answer is given by certain of the mesons, but quantitative
measurements await further development, because the forces acting
between a meson and proton or neutron are said to be approximately one
thousand times stronger than the forces acting between an electron and
electric field.

However, in keeping with the differences in the speed of phenomena
within the atom, could we not say that the vortical currents were
sufficiently strong to keep the nuclear matter concentrated in a
comparatively small area regardless of its apparent mass relationships?
In other words, if gravity is recognized as a force acting inward as a
result of vortical currents of the atom, the weights and measures
developed in the vortical currents of the Earth have no intrinsic value
of themselves when referring to the atom. Information received by the
B.S.R.A. states if one atom were ever truly smashed, your whole

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

system would be turned into a super solar . . . nothing but light
radiation . . . many millions of times brighter than your sun." No
wonder space visitors are concerned over our atomic experiments!

Before we leave the subject of atomic structure, let's glance at the
idea of the *inverted* atom. Physicists have found short-lived particles
in all cases that are the electrical opposites of the prevalent
particles in our atomic structure. Some of these, including the newly
found anti-proton have been found in cosmic rays. These are evidently
the particles that form atoms built with negative nuclei and positive
satellites. Substances constructed of such atoms would be identical
except that they would be *invisible* to our physical senses, which were
constructed to recognize substance formed of atoms having positive
nuclei and negative satellites. Physical vision is sensitive only to
positive light reflecting from negative substance on a negative planet.
Inner perceptions see colors resulting from negative light. Neither
reflections from negative substance or reflections from positive
substance *are reality*, and neither are they visions . . . they are
only *reflections from reality*.

Now let us consider molecular structure:

The structure of a molecule is dependent on the structure of the atoms
of which it is composed. Science has recently found that in order for
two atoms of hydrogen to associate themselves as a molecule, their
respective single electrons must have opposite directions of rotation or
spin. Thus we see the positive-negative association into oneness
reflected even

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

in the molecule.

Like planets, some molecules possess rotational energy and others, such
as the diatomic symmetrical molecules of hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen,
do not.

When atoms or molecules are arranged in perfect order, the result is
known as a crystal. Irregularity of atomic or molecular order results in
a fluid. A true solid state is always in a definite crystalline form.
Crystals of pure metals have recently been studied and it has been found
that different crystal faces of a metal behave as if they were entirely
different metals. Evidently, the crystalline geometrical forms
determined by the electro-magnetic field of the atoms produce a
differing field on each face.

Crystals which do not have identical characteristics in all directions
(not cubic) are called anisotropic crystals. When a ray of light enters
an anisotropic crystal it is split into two components which travel with
different velocities and follow different paths. Perhaps the crystal is
here dividing the positive and negative light lines of force.

Another interesting fact of molecular structure that has recently been
revealed is that the thousands of atoms in fibrous protein molecules
such as those composing hair, horn, fingernail, muscle and porcupine
quill, are arranged in the form of a helix. This form results when
asymmetric objects (the amino acids) are joined together in such a way
that each one has the same geometrical relationship to its neighbors.
Some of these molecules then form a compound helix or a

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

coil of coils, etc. Thus science is discovering the linking forms
between the atom and the biological structures.

An electron micrograph of a bacterial flagellum has shown a three-strand
cable which by its diameter suggests it is a seven-strand cable of
seven-strand cables.

The space people have said that the forms of crystals within the blood
are the source of energy for man's every motion. The crystals in the
blood, by diffusing, refracting and reflecting the positive and negative
light lines of force, and by opposing polarized conditions, bring about
the flow of the blood by light energy and as a result, the functioning
of the heart.

The fact that there are crystals within the blood stream is significant
in relation to the use of the crystalline form in the Type 2 "fireball".
For more information on them see *The Harvesters* in this book in the
section called: *Other Flesh*.

Man, intermediate between the Microcosm and the Macrocosm, shows
similarity to the atomic structure in the expansion and contraction of
his muscles, in his rhythmic breathing to sustain life, and his
shell-like fields of vibration surrounding the visible body.

Dr. Cecil Bowiby of Los Angeles, California, recently reported that he
has succeeded in photographing four distinct fields of vibration around
the human body which are in various colors invisible to the naked eye.
They are, respectively, about one-half

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

inch; six inches; three feet; and nine feet and over from the skin. He
believes the fourth field is the strongest, that is, most extensive when
persons radiate strong feelings, especially those of love and peace.

Now let us consider our own Solar System:

In *One Two Three . . . Infinity*, Dr. George Gamow says: "The picture
of an atom began to look more like a miniature solar system with an
atomic nucleus for the sun, and electrons for planets. The analogy with
the planetary system can be further strengthened by these facts: the
atomic nucleus contains 99.97 per cent of the total atomic mass as
compared with 99.87 per cent of the solar system concentrated in the
sun, and the distances between the planetary electrons exceed their
diameters by about the same factor (several thousand times) which we
find when comparing interplanetary distances with the diameters of the
planets. The more important analogy lies, however, in the fact that the
electric attraction-forces between the atomic nucleus and the electrons
obey the same mathematical law of inverse square (that is, the forces
are inversely proportionate to the square of the distance between two
bodies) as the gravity forces acting between the sun and the planets.
This makes the electrons describe the circular and elliptic trajectories
around the nucleus, similar to those along which the planets and comets
move in the solar system."

However, physicists have stressed the fact that "an atom differs from
the solar system by the fact

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

that it is not gravitation that makes electrons go round the nucleus,
but electricity." (H. N. Russell). But what difference does it make,
since gravity and electricity are both manifestations of
electromagnetism! This is an example of scientists calling *effect*,
cause . . . if they looked beyond gravitational and electrical phenomena
they would find the *cause* of both, which is electro-magnetism.

Another difference was also discovered. An electron in an atom, on
absorbing the energy of a photon (light), jumps to another orbit, and
again to another when it emits light and releases the energy of a
photon. Because of this phenomenon, comparison with the solar system did
not seem valid. A critic said: "We do not read in the morning newspapers
that Mars leaped to the orbit of Saturn, or Saturn to the orbit of
Mars." This is true, we do not read it in the newspapers, but the atom
with its system of electrons rotating around the central nucleus
resembles the planetary system. In considering the atom, the jumping of
electrons from one orbit to another, when hit by the energy of a photon,
takes place many times a second, whereas in accord with the vastness of
the solar system, a [similar](errata.htm#9.md) phenomenon occurs there once
in thousands of years. Our own Solar System has experienced
displacements in its planetary members over the centuries and this is
similar to the "orbit jumping" of an electron.

The circular motion of an electron around the nucleus of an atom, or a
planet around the sun of a solar system, gives rise to an intensive
electro-magnetic

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

radiation, and in this action they are *identical*. The circular motion
referred to is an *effect* of intersecting lines of force.

Now let us consider the Galactic System:

Toward the center of the Galactic System is found the nuclear region
which corresponds to the sun of a solar system and the nucleus of an
atom. The many solar systems revolving about the nucleus region of a
galaxy correspond to planets revolving about a sun and electrons
revolving about an atomic nucleus.

At present astronomers are wondering whether magnetic fields exist in
the galaxy. Cosmic radiation suggests an answer. The intensity of cosmic
radiation is almost the same anywhere on the globe. This indicates that
magnetic fields are bringing about a random distribution of cosmic rays
in space. Cosmic ray evidence is considered the strongest argument for
the existence of these fields. If an atom and a solar system operate in
an electromagnetic field, we would expect to find a galaxy also
operating in such a field. The rotation at the edges of a spiral galaxy
is slower than near the center, just as the outer planets in the solar
system travel slower than those near the sun.

The new word in astronomy is "magneto-hydrodynamics." Scientists say
that interstellar space is now known to be [pervaded](errata.htm#10.md) by
magnetic fields. Presumably they are produced by electric currents
circulating in space, say the astronomers. Modern theory begins to
visualize a galaxy as a tremendous

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

electro-magnet, with currents of electrons flowing not through wires but
through the viscous, turbulent eddies of gas swirling about its center.
Electromagnetic forces seem competent to do what turbulence alone cannot
do: they might form discrete arms and even lead to the formation of
stars and clusters of stars. The modern theory of a galaxy, according to
astronomers, promises to be as intricate as the now richly observed
structural details. Ten years ago in their hypotheses of cosmic
evolution they were thinking in terms of gravitation and light pressure.
Only yesterday they realized they may contemplate a galaxy that is
essentially a gravitating, turbulent electro-magnet.

Now let us consider the Supergalaxy:

Recent evidence obtained by photographic and radio astronomy indicates
that our disk-shaped galaxy we call the Milky Way is itself a member of
a disk-shaped galaxy or supergalaxy. The supergalaxy of which we are a
member may have a population of tens of thousands of galaxies. Its
nucleus is marked by the cluster of galaxies in the constellation Virgo.
Radio waves are picked up from the super-galaxy just as they are picked
up from near galaxies and the Milky Way. From study of the radial
velocities of galaxies, the indication is that the "inner metagalaxy"
(that is the nearest regions of extra-galactic space) is rotating. This
rotation is believed to be a property of the local supergalaxy. Several
other supergalaxies have been found indicating the possibility or rather
probability of a hierarchy of

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

systems of ever greater size *ad infinitum*. Also, scientists have come
to the conclusion that the Universe has been expanding since about five
billion years ago before which it was contracting. Even the Universe is
"breathing" as do the lines of force that bring about the atom.

Space intelligences have said: "Progression is only recorded by change
and one who understands even his present environment is indeed a
master."

In 1888, S. Harris said: "Suns and planets and cosmic forces are the
words in which His thoughts are written."
