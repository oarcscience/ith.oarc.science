# EPILOGUE

The book you have just read and the thoughts contained therein are but a
"pale shadow" of things to come. Time is running out, but there will be
no "end", there will only be a "beginning". Terrestrial Man seems
incapable at this moment of making "One World", but he will soon face
the more profound challenge to create "One City of the Universe".

Man will go on into ever expanding [grandeur](errata.htm#55.md); for even
when the whole celestial Universe has been mapped, studied and charted,
there will be Universes beyond to tempt human imagination.

In all great adventures of ideas the only prayer which we can address to
God is: "Grant us patience." And, "Seek ye the Lord while he may be
found, call ye upon him while he is near." (Isaiah 55:6).

"So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not
return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it
shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. For ye shall go out with
joy, and led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break
forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap
their hands." (Isaiah 55:11-12).

Remember the words of the Master in St. Mark 13:37: "And what I say unto
you I say unto all, *Watch!*"
