### CHAPTER II.

Before any appreciable gain can be made by earthly representatives of
thy Master's coming kingdom, there must come the downfall of vast
numbers of bombastic declaimers of their own inflated belief in their
own importance and influence over the people. *Assent gained through
fear or force melts to nothingness when assailed by cold logic or
intense loyalty to higher concepts!*

A long and arduous warfare hath been waged against "the powers of
darkness" impinging upon all earth's inhabitants from invisible citadels
where Lucifer long reigned supreme over his vassals (invisible to
mortals) assigning them to tasks of fiendish ingenuity to entrap and
inveigle human beings into abject slavery to his demands.

By reason of the unremitting diligence of those to whom was relegated
the apprehension and elimination of countless millions of demoniacs and
demoniacally controlled entities, sworn to obey the edits of their
overlord, Lucifer—I say, as a result of this uninterrupted campaign on
the astral planes, it now be possible to transfer this battle to the
physical

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

plane and repeat the process where mortals may more effectively join in
the conflict and observe greater tangible results.

As it doth rage on the physical plane, there be three types of weapons
to be employed. First: the actual material armaments necessary for
defense purposes. Second: the mental agility to recognize and combat
delusive propaganda. Third: the spiritual awareness and moral stamina to
move steadily forward, in defiance of all enemy resistance, to establish
and maintain a rigorous regime of *honest* government in every phase of
human affairs.

Ye may say the present deplorable condition of earthly affairs hath
always existed and always will. I SAY NAY! Through man's willful
disobedience it hath reached a point where his own most determined
efforts to remove the accumulated incubus of overwhelming pressure from
subversive forces be [well-nigh](errata.htm#6.md) futile.

Divine intervention (operating through chosen emissaries endowed with
power and authority to abolish the hellish system in force when Lucifer
and his minions held sway) hath prevailed upon invisible planes
adjoining the earth and the roving hordes of diabolical perverters of
unresisting mortals be either removed or under control.

Now cometh the final stage in this stupendous project. Not without
physical discomfort and suffering

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

may the victory be won. Mortals must prove their mettle. Ye may look
upon this time of tribulation as a bitter and unwarranted trespass on
thy right to lead a life of honor and dignity. Even so! Yet it doth
afford thee a glorious opportunity to show thyselves (sic—JBH) worthy to
participate in the responsibilities as well as the privileges of the
"Golden Age." Privileges forever denied those now responsible for
retarding its inauguration.

No matter how previous be the suffering of many mortals in this final
phase in the transformation of thy world, all who will stand firm in
their defense of the Right (on whatever battlefield they fight) will
soon realize that they have rendered a priceless service to their Master
and his conquering legions from outer space, now able to traverse the
hitherto impenetrable density of earth's auric envelope and bring succor
and strength to the Christ Forces in mortal flesh.

A change cometh swiftly over the face of the earth and the peoples
residing thereon. Hour by hour the forces of evil themselves disclose
their dire purposes. Close upon the heels of these disclosures come the
rapidly maturing decisions of the Enlightened Ones now dwelling in
fleshly bodies, to reverse the edicts of false leaders and substitute
their own true concepts of constructive action to insure the survival of
desperately beleaguered followers of One sent to teach men the Way of
Life!
