### CHAPTER XV

Although the scientific discoveries and inventions of the New Age will
cause endless amazement and discussion over the new methods introduced,
a much more important phase will radically change all of man's relations
with his fellowmen.

We speak of the "lectures" (if ye would so name them) which will be
given in all parts of the world upon any subject pertinent to that
particular section and the inhabitants thereof. These demonstrations of
practical ways in which newly apprehended etheric forces may be utilized
to lighten laborious tasks and increase the comfort and happiness of the
so-called "common people" will be arranged by the leaders appointed.
These special leaders will not be chosen by the people, since their
duties will not be of a judiciary character. They will be persons of
high intelligence and spiritual enlightenment, yet withal, keenly aware
of the vital necessity for bringing these attributes into play in a
realistic way, during the reconstruction period of the world's
regeneration.

These leaders will make all arrangements for the addresses but they will
not be the speakers. One of the very surprising incidents of the New Era
will be the introduction of Teachers from the now "invisible" realms.
These visiting instructors will be experts

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

chosen for their intimate knowledge and experience along the various
lines in which their audiences desire to excel. They will be garbed in
accord with the customs of those who come to learn of them. They will
speak their language. It will not be some "foreigner" intruding to
instruct in the use of strange new implements and stranger modes of
dress and behavior. It will be like one of their very own people
pointing out to them better ways of managing their own affairs, that
they may minimize and finally abolish evils long existent. Little by
little, through their *own efforts*, in response to suggestions given,
their entire mode of living will be elevated to a higher standard than
they have ever known.

I speak not of deliberately retrogressive nations. They will no longer
cumber the earth. Those of whom I speak are inherently honest and
honorable members of the human race who have been repressed and
retarded, not of their own volition but through forced subjection to men
more powerful and aggressive but far less amenable to higher instruction
and consequent progress. They will soon emerge from the apathy induced
by domination to the point of slavery, and their minds once awakened
will eagerly accept and put into actual practice the principles
explained and new methods applicable to their daily tasks. By utilizing
"moving pictures" (taken on other planets) demonstrating these improved
techniques

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

within the compass of their understanding, then patiently answering
questions regarding the use of unfamiliar implements, they will readily
respond and cooperate.

We use these downtrodden people to illustrate this system of teaching.
By "importing" speakers from high planes and other planets to give
detailed instructions on a multitude of different topics, fully
illustrated, desired changes in customs and general behavior of the
populace will be quickly achieved.

The very novelty of such an experience will lend interest and there will
be a certain prestige attached to adopting the advice of these adepts
from hitherto unknown sections of the Universe. Even the simplest of
counsel will acquire fresh significance when given by so distinguished a
coterie of speakers! This plan will augment and greatly simplify the
work of those mortals who will be called upon to conduct classes for the
enlightenment of willing but ignorant aspirants wishing to qualify for
New Age Living.

None will be asked to sit in any dark and poorly ventilated room to meet
these guests from realms long regarded as invisible. Nay, they will
appear among ye as well attired as thyselves (sic—JBH) and ye will so
welcome them, with unaffected cordiality!

This be a most pleasant occurrence to contemplate and it shall surely
come to pass! It is plainly depicted on the Screen of Things-to-Come!
Amen! So be it!

*A WORD OF EXPLANATION  
FROM ASHTAR!*

A most gratifying change is now taking place in the general attitude of
the people of Shan (the earth). No longer do great masses of the
inhabitants of this and other countries, regard our super-powered
airships as monstrosities threatening their safety of body and property
but adopt a more sane and cooperative course of action, showing
willingness to give us the benefits of a doubt as to our intentions.

We cannot but feel somewhat amused at times over the pride exhibited by
those who have succeeded in registering undecipherable squeaks and
whistling sounds on their poorly constructed receiving instruments! Were
they familiar with the forces we employ in sending these signals (which
are not, in most instances, intended to be translated into the language
of any particular country) we could soon devise a method of
communication satisfactory to everyone concerned. I speak of a
mechanism. As the matter now stands, it is we who must acquaint
ourselves with the curious combinations of sounds transmitting to your
minds the ideas to be conveyed. These vary so completely in different
sections of the globe as to present quite a problem to our men. Were you
conversant

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

with the art of thought transference, as we know and practice it, our
friendly intercourse would lose much of its present difficulty and
become a pleasing possibility. Our use of this type of "conversation"
has been developed over uncounted ages of constant practice. When we
employ your method of using appropriate *words* to convey our meaning,
it is to us as tedious as if you had to spell aloud (or write) each word
you wished to speak, which you would find quite tiresome . . . the
latter often necessary in talking with the deaf. Thus (not intending any
disrespect) we must perforce regard earth dwellers somewhat in the light
of "deaf people" who must be reached through the medium of sight.

We ourselves have to a great extent dispensed with sound, so many noises
to which you are accustomed (therefore do not seem annoying) are to our
sensitized ears almost "deafening" as you would express it. You marvel
that our Space Ships operate noiselessly; that we appear and disappear
without the least sound, or at most a "swishing sound" caused by contact
with your dense atmosphere.

Can you not understand we must *learn* to do what we have in mind, using
the crude elements at your disposal, since you have little or no
knowledge of the existence of forces we find so perfectly suited to our
purposes? We fully realize how impossible it is for you to duplicate our
accustomed modes of procedure

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

in all the practical details of our ordinary daily lives, with your
present limited "laboratory" of etheric essences suited only to the
present atmospheric conditions surrounding your planet.

And so, my friends, we are forced to acquaint ourselves with *your*
irksome limitations and adapt ourselves to *your* rather trying
conditions, atmospherically and in many other ways, that we may be able
to render the assistance asked of us in the present transition of your
darkened planet into an orb of shining splendor!

That this transition must take place simultaneously on the material, the
mental and the soul levels (irrespective of purely religious concepts),
poses many seemingly insurmountable difficulties.

That which *cannot*, because of its very nature, or *will not*, by
reason of man's free choice, be transmuted into a higher rate of
vibration . . . must through "Natural Laws" (similar to the familiar Law
of Gravitation) sink to a level disassociating it from that portion of
the earth and its inhabitants capable of rising to a finer type of
existence, compatible with the vastly accelerated (or "quickened" since
it is more *alive*) condition in which you will soon find yourselves!

If you are able to visualize such a marvelously, joyously "revised
edition" of your present doleful life in toto . . . then I greet you as
future residents of the New World in a New Age!

My Love!  
(Signed) ASHTAR
