<p align="center"><i>A LETTER TO YOU<br> FROM SCHARE!</i></p>  
<p>We will continue our description of life on Venus, as a fitting prelude to our well earned privilege of serving in our present capacity . . . not technically designated as "teachers" but more in the role of "elder brothers," guiding, encouraging and commending any forward step, as our comrades of earth fall into line with our steady march toward our goal . . . the acceptance of our Beloved Commander-in-Chief, Jesus Christ, as Ruler of Shan (planet earth)! Until he mounts his rightful throne of Power and Glory, and is accepted by mankind in a true spirit of loyalty and devotion, we are bound by our sacred word of honor to serve in any way which will speed that denouement.</p>  
<p>Let us, then, proceed to our task of enlightening our friends on Shan as to some aspects of our accustomed mode of "home life," which has afforded us a maximum of physical delight (my scribe questions that term) but we <i>do</i> enjoy the sensory pleasures which you fear lost as you make the transition</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_70"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 70</FONT></A></p>  
<p>into what you have named the "Fourth Dimension." True, it takes a little preparation to enter into this higher vibrational environment and participate to the fullest extent in the rare privileges which are ours. However, I assure you without equivocation our joy in the satisfying of every desire (since we have learned the secret of desiring only what is for our highest good) goes so far beyond anything you have experienced in your present earth-life that we are at a loss to know how to employ phrases strong enough to make it real to you!</p>  
<p>When you "hear" the full, complete harmony of a celestial orchestra or the crystal-clear tones of a heart-stirring melody sung by one you regard as angelic . . . when a fragrance of unforgettable sweetness is wafted to you from you know not where . . . when a mental vision is reflected from some entrancing beauty spot, perhaps on Venus itself .. . when there surges through your entire being ecstasy which sets your heart aglow with love for every creature, for every growing thing from tiniest blossom to towering monarch of the forest, for every mortal who worships the great Creator . . . when you enjoy the full flavor of a delectable contribution to your daily repast direct from Nature's matchless storehouse of edibles (unspoiled by man's tampering processes) . . . have you not had a tantalizing foretaste of the "sensory pleasures" which many earth</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_71"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 71</FONT></A></p>  
<p>people imagine they must forego upon leaving their earth home which has yielded them all too scanty a portion of genuine pleasure?</p>  
<p>Yet it is an undeniable fact that we retain, in amplified, intensified form suited to our more sensitized capacity for enjoyment, all you have found truly pleasurable in your "material existence" as you call it. We <i>hear</i> and are especially susceptible to <i>aromas</i> . . . though we have none offensive to our sensitive nostrils. We have <i>clarity</i> of vision, extending to realms hidden from your eyes, no matter how expert your oculist may be! Our sense of touch is delicately adjusted to objects cast in a more etheric mold than those you encounter, and more easily shattered. In fact, they may be altered or even obliterated by the power of thought alone (which might be considered a desirable achievement in the case of decrepit bits of furnishings I have observed, especially in what you name your "attics"?)</p>  
<p>Please! I have the greatest possible respect and admiration for anyone who makes the best of their possessions however crude . . . but I was thinking of what you often refer to as "trash" kept about for no good reason. I heartily concur in "C. N.'s" advice to "streamline your possessions."</p>  
<p>I have not touched upon the more spiritual aspects of our lives, which to us are precious beyond all else.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Our lives abound in an ever-expanding appreciation of blessings accruing from a free expression of our highest aspirations. We shall try to take you further into our confidence and our plans for your happiness when next we chat with you. Until then, my love and my warmest gratitude for your assurances of your confidence and affection, received by mail and via "wireless!" Thank you and God bless you!</p>
