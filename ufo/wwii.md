    Point of information - this engagement was called the "Battle of Los
    Angeles".  According to a memo by Gen. George C. Marshall, quoted in
    Tim Good's book "Above Top Secret", 1,430 round of ack-ack fire (not
    missiles) were discharged during the engagement.  The outlines of the
    airborne objects could be made out.  Note that, if these were enemy
    airplanes, they would have been downed in short order, especially with
    that volume of ack-ack fire.  Instead, the shells merely exploded around
    or detonated on the objects, without apparent harm.
