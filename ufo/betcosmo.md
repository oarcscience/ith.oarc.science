    Betting on the cosmos

    If we had to choose sides in a dispute over the cosmos between Dr. Stephen
    W. Hawking and just about anyone, we'd put our money on Hawking.  But if we
    had in one recent bet, we'd have lost.
         Hawking, the brilliant Cambridge University scientist who is regarded
    as being almost in the same theoretical league as Albert Einstein, made a
    bet with two California Institute of Technology professors six years ago that
    naked singularities could not exist.  Last week Hawking paid off:  100 pounds
    sterling, plus a T-shirt inscribed, ''Nature Abhors a Naked Singularity.''
         That message isn't exactly a total concession, but that's because
    Hawking lost on a technicality.  We'll explain.
         Actually, we can't explain because we don't quite get it.  So we'll
    borrow the description of New York Times science writer Malcolm W. Browne.
         First, Browne's definition of the terms:  A singularity is a
    mathematical point at which space and time are infinitely distorted, where
    matter is infinitely dense, and where the rules of relativistic physics and
    quantum mechanics break down.  Singularities are believed to lurk at the
    hearts of black holes, which conceal their existence from the outer world.
         A naked singularity would be a singularity without a black-hole shell,
    and therefore visible, in principle, to outside observers.
         Black holes can't actually be seen, but they can be observed because
    their gravitational effects suck in matter, which spirals toward the hole,
    is heated and gives off light; their X-rays and other radiation have been
    detected by observatories.
         By the way, this sort of stuff isn't just the whimsical speculation of
    astrophysical theorists.  The right answers could help explain the working
    of one naked singularity of singular importance to us:  the Big Bang, which
    theoretically spun off our universe, and perhaps countless others, 15 billion
    years ago.
         The winners of the bet with Hawking are Dr. Kip S. Thorne and Dr. John
    P. Preskill who, like Hawking, are researchers into cosmic relativity.  They
    based their victory, such as it is, on some recent supercomputer calculations
    by Dr. Matthew Choptuik of the University of Texas at Austin, who concluded
    that there could be special circumstances in which a naked singularity could
    be created from a collapsing black hole.
         Choptuik concedes that the circumstances are a long shot, comparable to
    standing a pencil on is sharpened tip:  improbable, but theoretically
    possible.
         Now you can see why Hawking hasn't given up easily.  He's never seen a
    pencil stand on its tip, either.
         Hawking promptly made another bet with his two Cal Tech peers:  Although
    there may be a very limited set of conditions that could result in a naked
    singularity, no general conditions for such a phenomenon would be found.
         That makes sense to us.  We're putting our money on Hawking.

    In Physics, the Naked Win

    Scientists are not what you'd call high rollers.  But in 1991 STEPHEN HAWKING, 
    the brilliant, paralyzed British physicist, bet American colleagues KIP THORNE 
    and JOHN PRESKILL that there is no such thing as a naked singularity in 
    physics.  A singularity is an object of such density that the laws of physics 
    do not apply to it.  A naked singularity is such an object outside a black 
    hole, but Hawking believes it can exist only inside a black hole.  He lost his 
    bet when someone else proved that you could, in theory, focus gravity waves so 
    precisely as to create a naked singularity.  ''Stephen took a while to accept 
    the result,'' says Preskill, but now Hawking has paid up:  #100 (about 
    [US]$163), some ''clothing to cover the winner's nakedness'' and a thumbprint 
    on a concession statement.  The physicist didn't give in easily.  The message 
    on the T shirts he gave Thorne and Preskill reads, NATURE ABHORS A NAKE 
    SINGULARITY.
