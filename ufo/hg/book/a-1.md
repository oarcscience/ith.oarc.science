*Appendix A:*

**Statements Written by Students**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *March 1, 1996 -- February 15, 1997*

When it became evident that we were going to publish some of our
material as a book, some of the students indicated that they would like
to contribute. Although some of those who wanted to write a statement
felt that they might not be well qualified, they were encouraged to
express what they desired. The following are the students' attempts to
express the thoughts and concepts our Older Members have addressed in
the pages of this book and have shared with us throughout this classroom
experience.
