*Section 6:*

**Statements/Posters of Public Meetings**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *1994*

This section contains the chronology of posters we used to advertise the
1993/1994 meetings held throughout the USA. To cover the country more
quickly and thoroughly, we divided up the members of the class into four
and sometimes five groups. For the most part, our primary means to
inform the public of an upcoming meeting was to tack up these posters on
bulletin boards, telephone poles, and the like. In addition, we did some
advertising with local media and gave numerous interviews to newspapers,
radio stations, and TV news teams.

As a side note, we generally refer to the meetings as having occurred in
1994, when the entire class went "out on the road," even though we did
hold two small meetings at the end of 1993, as sort of a trial run. They
helped us refine our presentation somewhat. At times it was difficult
for us to know what to cover and what to leave out, since the
information is so vast. The last public meeting we held took place in
Boston, Massachusetts on Friday, August 19, 1994.
