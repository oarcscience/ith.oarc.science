### **UFO TWO AND CREW SAY:**

**"THE SHEDDING OF OUR BORROWED**

**HUMAN BODIES MAY BE REQUIRED IN**

**ORDER TO TAKE UP OUR NEW BODIES**

**BELONGING TO THE NEXT WORLD."**

IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE WITH US YOU MUST BE WILLING TO LOSE

EVERYTHING OF THIS WORLD IN ORDER TO HAVE LIFE IN THE NEXT.

CLING TO THIS WORLD AND YOU'LL SURELY DIE.

-   Crew says they are from another Time - an Evolutionary Kingdom Level
    Far Above Human (what humans refer to as the Kingdom of God) - where
    Creation originates.
-   They admit to an "undercover" presence for more than 20 years.
-   Their bodies (as containers) were "picked" and "prepped" by others
    from their "world" beginning as early as the late '20's, though
    they've been bringing in crew members (in soul bodies) from their
    spacecrafts (UFOs) on Earth's surface since the early 1970's (the
    first wave in mid-1970's, the second and final wave in the early
    1990's), for them to individually begin "incarnating" or taking over
    those prepped bodies.
-   Each crew member has taken over an adult human body - the two crew
    instructors first - who subsequently gathered and assisted other
    crew members in gaining control over their chosen human bodies.
-   <span id="lnk1"></span>They say that this planet is ruled by
    malevolent adversary races of space aliens and has been, for the
    most part, since this immediate civilization's beginning.
-   They say that Representatives from their time nurtured a number of
    human strains in the early stages of this civilization, and later
    sent two Representatives (the younger of which was incarnate) 2000
    years ago, for a brief visit with a small crew (in training) to
    attempt to expose to the humans their enslaved predicament, while
    even offering them a way out.
-   They say that Earth's humans are unknowingly even more enslaved
    today. The malevolent aliens use "psychological warfare" techniques
    to keep Earth's humans bound in a state of regression, while
    thinking they are advancing.
-   This visiting crew states that their "world" is a genderless
    (sexless), non-mammalian (though certainly non-reptilian),
    crew-minded, service-oriented world that finds greed, lust, and
    self-serving pursuits abhorrent.
-   <span id="lnk2"></span>They say that they can explain how their
    numbers periodically may increase, and how "new" members can be born
    in a human body (its soul "awakened" out of dormancy) and can use
    that human body as its "cocoon" or "chrysalis" for its next-world
    body (what some orientations refer to as "glorified body"). Their
    world's members do not seek independence, but live to look entirely
    to their "Older" (more experienced) Members, on up the "vine" to the
    "Chief of Chiefs."
-   Now, as they prepare to leave, they are more open about their
    purpose, since possible adverse reactions by this world to their
    knowledge and behavior, can no longer interfere with their mission.
-   <span id="lnk3"></span>They say that they may be required to discard
    their "undercover costume" (their borrowed human body) as they
    depart - leaving their "chrysalis" behind.
-   If their Father does not require this "disposition" of them - He
    will take them up into His "cloud of light" (spacecraft) before such
    "laying down of bodies" need occur.
-   <span id="lnk4"></span>Any who would be "born" into their world must
    willingly break all ties to this world, forsaking all
    human-mammalian behavioral traits. Their physical bodies in their
    world are - in comparison to human bodies - incorruptible and
    imperishable (non-decaying).
-   <span id="lnk6"></span>They feel strongly that all visitations from
    the Evolutionary Level Above Human have been corrupted by the
    malevolent space alien races into binding human religions - as soon
    as those "Next Level" members departed.
-   This crew claims that the Level Above Human is in the process of
    recycling Earth's environment and inhabitants in preparation for a
    new beginning.
