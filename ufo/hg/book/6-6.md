*ORGANIZED RELIGION (ESPECIALLY CHRISTIAN)*

****

HAS BECOME THE PRIMARY PULPIT FOR

MISINFORMATION AND THE

*"GREAT COVER-UP"*

-   Those who are unhappy with what this world has to offer, or are
    seeking the *real* Truth, have turned to New Age, Eastern religions,
    or simply have "dropped out" to indulge in whatever excesses might
    bring them pleasure. And why shouldn't they? <span
    id="lnk1"></span>Who can blame them? Nowhere, especially not in the
    churches, can they find the answers to the purpose of their
    existence or any hope for a soul's future. **The most significant
    information, that which was offered 2000 years ago by a
    Representative from the "future" - the Evolutionary Level Above
    Human (the real Kingdom of Heaven), has been completely ignored or
    obscured.** That Representative's "hard-core" teaching - the <span
    id="lnk2"></span>*formula* for entering "His Father's Kingdom" (that
    Evolutionary Level Above Human) - cannot be found anywhere on the
    planet, least of all in the teachings of the churches. **<span
    id="lnk5"></span>The Christians have unwittingly even become their
    own dreaded *Anti-Christ*.** Jesus had no wife nor children, His
    followers were His "family." He required of His students (disciples)
    that they drop *everything* (all possessions, ties, and attachments)
    and literally go with Him. He warned His "followers" that their
    enemies would likely be those of their own household, that they
    would be hated by all men, and that as they adopted more of His ways
    and thinking, they would *hate* or *abhor everything* that could
    pull them back into their "old" world (including their human father,
    mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, and even the love of
    *their own life*), or anything that could *interfere* with their
    commitment to Him and His Father's Kingdom.
-   <span id="lnk7"></span>Jesus was *not* a religious man or spiritual
    person according to present day interpretation. He was a man of the
    *future* - from the future, ahead of this civilization's time - from
    an actual physical Evolutionary Kingdom Level above the human
    kingdom, in the same way that humans are "supposedly" an
    evolutionary kingdom level above Earth's animal kingdom. **Members
    of the Kingdom Level Above Human *identify with* or think of
    themselves as the "spirit" or "soul," and their body as a
    "container." Whereas members of the human kingdom primarily identify
    with or think of themselves as the physical body (and wonder if they
    *might* have a soul).** Members of the Kingdom that He - the one who
    was in Jesus - came from, treat their physical bodies as "suits of
    clothes" and thereby can leave those "Next Level" bodies behind and
    even incarnate into a human body as He did. **The mind or spirit
    that was in Jesus did *not* incarnate in the infant, but rather it
    incarnated when the body He took was approximately 29 to 30 years
    old** - at the event recorded in the Bible as the "Holy Spirit"
    descending upon Him as a dove. Compared to a human spirit, His
    Spirit, having come from that Next Kingdom Level, was a pure or
    "Holy" Spirit, revered by His disciples - seen as Divine - and
    rightfully so. The body that was "picked" for Him had been monitored
    and "prepped" since infancy by Members of the Kingdom Level Above
    Human in anticipation of the day that He would "take it over" or
    incarnate into it.
-   **In the same way, in this generation, two bodies were "picked" and
    "prepped" for the two members from that "Next Level" who would
    incarnate in them, a Younger Member and an Older Member - a "Son"
    and his "Father." This time those two Representatives incarnated
    into their picked or chosen bodies in the early 1970's, bodies that
    were in their 40's.** They then, in 1975, put out a "call" for the
    souls who came with them for this task, and these two Teachers
    assisted those prospective members of that Next Kingdom Level in
    incarnating into (taking over) the bodies that had been set aside
    for them. These two Teachers then literally took these prospective
    members out of, or "lifted them out" of the world with the bodies
    they would take charge of. They assisted the students in the tedious
    and difficult process of becoming *new creatures* - filling those
    bodies with the *mind*, the *thoughts*, the *behavior*, the
    "*spirit*" from the Kingdom Level Above Human. This classroom was in
    total seclusion for almost 18 years.
-   These students of the Next Level have now been given the task of
    going out and finding the second and last wave or "harvest" of souls
    or spirits who have been brought back into the human kingdom to
    receive - *incarnate into* - the bodies that have been picked and
    prepped for *them.* As the prospective members of the second harvest
    connect with the students from the first - and learn from them -
    they too will be *literally* taken out of the world and through the
    incarnating process - the taking over of a body, aborting its human
    mind and programming, and filling it with the *mind* of their
    *Teacher*, and of *His Older Member*, and of that *Kingdom Level
    Above Human*.
-   **Those *souls* who successfully bond to their *new* "Father" and
    His Kingdom will literally leave the human kingdom** and become
    members in the physical Kingdom from whence came the mind (the soul)
    that was in Jesus, and the minds (the souls) that *are* in these two
    Teachers. As Jesus came and left in a "cloud of light," so also
    these Teachers, along with their students from both harvests, came -
    and will leave - in the same manner (a spacecraft, "UFO," belonging
    to the *true* Kingdom of God). They will not need to be a part of
    the human kingdom again. These who have successfully overcome
    human-mammalian *behavior* and *thinking* ("washed their robes"
    under the tutorship of their Teachers), and have replaced it with
    the behavior and thinking of that *Next Kingdom Level*, are now
    ready for **service,** for the first time, to the *true* Kingdom of
    Heaven - the only *real* Kingdom of God.
-   All souls retain, at all evolutionary levels, the *free will* to
    accept tutorship, remain loyal to their parentage in that Kingdom
    Level, or separate, feeling that they no longer need to remain a
    child, a servant - even in the Kingdom of Heaven. The spirit or soul
    referred to as Satan or Lucifer was once a child, a son, in the real
    Kingdom of Heaven. He exercised his "free will" to go his separate
    way and attempt to create his "own heaven." He even took what was
    estimated to be one-third of the creatures who were young children
    in that Kingdom with him, for they were still susceptible to his
    leadership. Those individuals now circulate in the Heavens, and we
    refer to them as various **"Luciferian" space races** (who also
    travel in their more primitive spacecrafts, or UFOs). Having lost
    their standing in the true Kingdom of Heaven or the Kingdom of their
    CREATOR, they **had no choice but to return to human-like behavior
    and mammalian limitations.** They use the humans for their own
    purposes, and do all within their power to prohibit the humans from
    ever knowing the truth about their ex-Father's Kingdom. <span
    id="lnk4"></span>**They bind the human souls to this world through:
    a preoccupation with sexuality** (indulgence in all the
    pleasures/addictions of the human senses); **reproductivity**
    (family); **service to the human kingdom** (within a structure of
    indebtedness and credit); and non- disputable, "moral"
    **responsibility to their family, community, race, nation, and their
    unknowingly distorted *religious* concepts.**
-   <span id="lnk6"></span>Many Bible students, some Christian
    denominations, and to a greater extent the so-called "charismatics"
    or "spirit-filled" say they are waiting for the "Second Coming."
    **That same *mind*, that same *information* of the *true* Kingdom of
    Heaven, which was in Jesus, has come again, for the "second time,"
    in this civilization.** That *mind*, the one that spoke through the
    body named Jesus, told His followers that He would come again,
    though He also told them not to believe any who would say that
    "Jesus" (the name of His human body 2000 years ago) was on "this
    mountain" or in "that desert," for that "body" would **not** return.
    The two events that most Christians say they are eagerly
    anticipating have occurred: *the "Second Coming"* (as just
    described) and *the "Raptures"* (the first of which happened in
    1975-76, the second of which is occurring now as the second harvest
    is "lifted out" of their world). <span id="lnk3"></span>The
    Luciferians, who have taken over the religions, would have their
    "faithful" die and go to their "heaven" without doing any of the
    necessary *overcoming*, for "He did it all" - "He shed His blood" -
    in order that you might "be saved." **You *can't* simply be a good
    "Christian," die, and go to the *true* Kingdom of Heaven. You can
    only become a *new creature*, a *Heavenly creature*, while a Member
    of the Kingdom Level Above Human is incarnate in the human kingdom
    to take you through that "*birthing*."** That *birthing* requires
    that you become **dead** to all **humanness** and have *only* the
    *consciousness* - the *mind* - of a *child* in that *new Kingdom
    Level* - totally under the *care* and *keeping* of your "*new
    Father*" (Older Member), your "*new family*," who takes you into
    that *Kingdom*.
-   **This is obviously, by human judgment, the "Cult of Cults"** - but
    for the chosen, it's the *only way* into their "*Heavenly Father's
    House*." You will have to judge for yourselves who we are. **The
    Church,** the New Age, and the Charismatics **will likely call *us*
    the Anti-Christ, for we don't simply stand for "peace," "love," and
    "light" for this world.**
