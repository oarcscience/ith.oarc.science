**'88 Update**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## *1988*

The ***'88 Update*** was written while we were in seclusion during the
first "snatching away" and was made public to a minor degree through a
mailing to various New Age Centers, Health Food Stores, writers,
preachers, ufologists, monasteries, and so on. Beginning in
approximately late 1986 and continuing throughout this time period, some
extremely revealing information was surfacing worldwide. Reports of
government cover-ups of UFO crashes, alien technology being acquired and
tested by the military, and rumors of underground bases housing joint
alien/government projects circulated widely. In addition, detailed
reports of abductions of humans by space aliens for the purposes of
genetic experimentation and hybridization were escalating. It was a
particularly accelerated time in our own awakening as well. Missing
pieces of the puzzle were being given to us that broadened our overview
and helped to clarify some aspects of our own mission. We have no doubt
that the timing of these exposures was deliberate and calculated, not
only for our own sake but in preparing the world for events yet to
come.
