NOT a discussion of UFO sightings or phenomena

  
Two individuals say they were sent from the level above human, and are
about to leave the human level and literally (physically) return to that
next evolutionary level in a spacecraft (UFO) within months! "The Two"
will discuss how the transition from the human level to the next level
is accomplished, and when this may be done.

This is not a religious or philosophical organization recruiting
membership. However, the information has already prompted many
individuals to devote their total energy to the transitional process. If
you have ever entertained the idea that there may be a real, PHYSICAL
level beyond the Earth's confines, you will want to attend this meeting.
