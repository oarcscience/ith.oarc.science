"Thanks for Actions Against CAN"

Here’s a round of applause to the Church of Scientology for their courageous action 
against the Cult Awareness Network. 

From our point of view, no group was as "off" in their judgment as was CAN. No group was 
as out of place in their condemnation of the innocent as was CAN. 

They accused our group of "cult activities" promoting all sorts of lies about us. When we 
asked to speak with them to correct some of their false accusations, they refused to listen. 
Their only desire was to see our financial records and ironically, we really have no 
finances to speak of at all. They exerted no effort to determine the facts even when those 
who could most accurately provide those facts were literally at their doorstep. 

We hope you will continue to advertise on behalf of freedom of thinking for all. 

History proves that nearly every conceptual milestone now considered "good" was at one time 
considered a "cult." In the early/inception stages of any significantly updated thinking, 
it seems that some embodiment of narrow-minded opposition takes it upon themselves to 
threaten its right to exist. 

So thanks again from all of us determined to continue the search for Truth through 
alternate paths. And thanks from those who support the right of others to do so as well.
