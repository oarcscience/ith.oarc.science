    Subj: Scenario List

    Hello everyone,
    After reading many posts, and of course thinking and mulling this
    over; I've come up with a list of different scenarios that
    various types of people suscribe to, regarding UFOs.
    People like to think in terms of absolutes, it either has
    to be one way or another. Hopefully, looking at this
    list will help remove the blinders which limit our perspectives,
    and thus hides the full truth.

    --UFOs do not exist, and people who claim sightings are imagining it all.
    --UFOs may exist, but I don't want to think about them
    --UFOs are here and they are creatures from another planet in the material
      world. Unknown if they are good or evil.
    --UFOs are here and it is a multidimensional phenomema where creatures
      from the spiritual world are visibly entering our world. They are
      generally regarded as good. Angels, Holy Spirit, etc.
    --UFOs are real, but they are coming from earth, and the source is powerful
      and well hidden. Time travel may be involved. In other words,they may
      come from our own past or future.
    --UFOs are real, they come from the earth, and are new military craft.
      Everything in the media, is carefully orchestrated propaganda, used
      to cover the truth. This preys on people's fears and hopes.
    --Fast moving lights in the sky are new laser weapons being tested.
    --UFOs may be actual lifeforms which live in space, sort of like whales
      which can live in space and feed off the solar wind, they occaisionally
      swoop down to earth.
    --Multi-scenario; all or some of the above is happening at the same time
      and everyone confuses one for the other.

    Can you add to this? I want develope a definitive list. It helps me
    keep my mind open to all possibilities. Please keep your description
    short--- 3 or 4 lines.
