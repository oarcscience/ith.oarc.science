    ANCIENT CITY FOUND, IRRADIATED FROM ATOMIC BLAST  

         Radiation still so intense, the area is highly dangerous. 
         A heavy layer of radioactive ash in Rajasthan, India, covers a three 
    square mile area, ten miles west of Jodhpur.  Scientists are investigating the 
    site, where a housing development was  being built. 
         For some time it has been established that there is a very high rate of 
    birth defects and cancer in the area under construction.  The levels of 
    radiation there have registered so high on investigators' gauges that the 
    Indian government has now cordoned off the region. 
         Scientists have unearthed an ancient city where evidence shows an atomic 
    blast dating back thousands of years, from 8,000 to 12,000 years, destroyed 
    most of the buildings and probably a half-million people. 
         One researcher estimates that the nuclear bomb used was about the size of 
    the ones dropped on Japan in 1945. 
         The Mahabharata clearly describes a catastrophic blast that rocked the 
    continent.

         "A single projectile charged with all the power in the Universe... An 
    incandescent column of smoke and flame as bright as 10,000 suns, rose in all 
    its splendour...it was an unknown weapon, an iron thunderbolt, a gigantic 
    messenger of death which reduced to ashes an entire race. 
         "The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable.  Their hair and 
    nails fell out, pottery broke without any apparent cause, and the birds turned 
    white.
         "After a few hours, all foodstuffs were infected.  To escape from this 
    fire, the soldiers threw themselves into the river."  


    A HISTORIAN COMMENTS  

         Historian Kisari Mohan Ganguli says that Indian sacred writings  are full 
    of such descriptions, which sound like an atomic blast  as experienced in 
    Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  He says references  mention fighting sky chariots and 
    final weapons.  An ancient battle is described in the Drona Parva, a section 
    of the Mahabharata.
         "The passage tells of combat where explosions of final weapons decimate 
    entire armies, causing crowds of warriors with steeds and elephants and 
    weapons to be carried away as if they were dry leaves of trees," says Ganguli.
         "Instead of mushroom clouds, the writer describes a perpendicular 
    explosion with its billowing smoke clouds as consecutive openings of giant 
    parasols.  There are comments about the contamination of food and people's 
    hair falling out."


    ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION PROVIDES INFORMATION  

         Archeologist Francis Taylor says that etchings in some nearby temples he 
    has managed to translate suggest that they prayed to be spared from the great 
    light that was coming to lay ruin to the city.

         "It's so mind-boggling to imagine that some civilization had nuclear 
    technology before we did.
         "The radioactive ash adds credibility to the ancient Indian records that 
    describe atomic warfare."

         Construction has halted while the five member team conducts the 
    investigation.  The foreman of the project is Lee Hundley, who pioneered the 
    investigation after the high level of radiation was discovered.
