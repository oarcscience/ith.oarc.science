----- TURLEY WINS CRITICAL RULING -----

According to a Sept. 2 news article and Sept. 5 press release
Jonathan Turley, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the
hazardous waste suit against the Groom Lake base, appears to have
won a critical ruling.  Federal Judge Philip Pro has ruled that
the military must either make its Groom Lake environmental reports
public in compliance with Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
or seek an exemption directly from the President.  The judge has
set an Oct. 2 deadline for the government to decide what to do.

"On Oct. 2, citizens will learn they have a new federal facility,"
Turley said. "The president will now have to personally exempt
this facility by name, or order the military to operate it under
the same rules as other (bases)."

This ruling could be the first step toward Psychospy's goal of
someday eating in the base cafeteria and enjoying succulent prime
rib and filet mignon at below-Vegas prices.  Turley appears
ecstatic, but it is hard to guess what will really happen on Oct.
2.  Given their absolutist position in the past, the military
seems unlikely to take this lying down.  They could conceivably
appeal the ruling, which could delay compliance for months.

Turley shows no fear of a presidential exemption.  "If the
president wishes to deprive the public of environmental
information or allow the military to circumvent the law, he will
have to do so publicly and face the political consequences,"
Turley said. "He will have to do so in dozens of cases."

Sounds good, but we've heard only one side of the story, Turley's,
so we will wait to see how the other side responds.

___-- AUTOPSY DISSECTED -----

"GET ME A BRAIN, IGOR.  I MUST HAVE A BRAIN!"

The internet is looking like Frankenstein's laboratory these days
as armchair pathologists around the world dissect the alien body
shown on the alleged Roswell autopsy film.  It's the O.J. trial
all over again!  Guilty or not guilty, real or hoax?  This time
the setting is an anonymous morgue somewhere in the Twentieth
Century.  How many times can we watch the surgeon's knife drawn
across this poor bloated creature?  How long must we debate with
our email colleagues whether the alleged alien blood is oozing
just right?  After viewing the TV show frame by frame and
listening to the discussions on the net, Psychospy has made his
conclusion.

It's real.

The film that is.  It really exists.  We know it exists because it
was shown on Fox, the Simpsons/X-Files network, and they would
never lie to us (just selectively edit).  A more difficult
question, which others seem obsessed with but doesn't bother us
too much, is whether the alien shown on this real film is a real
extraterrestrial.  Our theory is that the truth will shake out on
its own, especially with so many net nerds currently chipping away
at it.  Eventually the accumulated evidence will be so
overwhelming as to make the truth perfectly obvious, one way or
the other, and we see no need to declare our beliefs in the
interim.

Far more interesting to us are the intellectual processes and
human impact of the public investigation.  It is fascinating to
watch ten thousand virtual human minds turn their resources to
this problem.  Many of these minds are virtual morons (VMs) whose
words just take up space in the newsgroups, but there are also a
few smart characters on the wires, including competent specialists
in movie props, theater lighting, medical procedures and military
history whose professional advice you might pay thousands of
dollars for in the real world.  Of course, even these experts
can't seem to agree.  For every Hollywood prop artist who says it
can't be done, there's another who says it can and under budget.

On the surface, the on-line investigation of the autopsy film
seems as noisy and chaotic as humanity itself, but when viewed
from above, a certain collective wisdom, larger than any one
member, is beginning to shine through.  Very few people seem to be
jumping to conclusions.  The dominant tone of on-line messages is,
"I don't know if the alien is real, but here's what I do know."
The debate overall has been remarkably logical and scientific,
with politics and emotions pushed to the background.

And in the process, whether by accident or design, the world is
now completely comfortable with alien autopsies.

Of course, if the autopsy is real, the release of the film could
be the most important event in the history of mankind, blah, blah.
If the film is a hoax, the simplest explanation is that it was
cooked up by clever con artists with no privileged information and
no motivations other than money.  Both options seem rather boring
and one-dimensional to us and leave nothing much to talk about.

Even if real, the alien just lies there without bringing us any
closer to the truth.  In our holographic folklore model [DR#29],
where we examine how this story fits with other saucer crash
claims, the film does not contribute anything significant to the
story we have already accumulated.  The autopsy alien has six
human-like fingers, not the four long, slender ones usually
reported.  This would have to be a different species of alien
altogether, one that lies outside the mainstream of our current
investigation.

Psychospy takes a pragmatic approach to the unknown.  There are
too many mysteries in the world for us to tackle them all, so we
have to focus on the few that we have the resources to deal with.
We are willing to let a paranormal claim remain unchallenged if we
cannot relate it in some way to things we already know.  We hate
to use the labels "true" or "false," instead we call things
"useful" or "not currently useful."  We can accept parallel
realities--that there might be both four-fingered and six-fingered
aliens--but we can only investigate one reality at a time, and
this must be the one we are currently best equipped to handle.
Our current conclusion about the autopsy film is that it isn't
very helpful in itself, but it might teach us something about the
people watching it.

After seeing the TV show several times, we are left with a lite
beer/diet soft drink kind of feeling, where we have consumed lots
of "product" but still feel empty.  The hollowness comes from the
lack of human connections.  If you seek photographic evidence of
the alien presence, here it is, but even the clearest film or
photograph is meaningless without direct human testimony to
establish its origins, and this we do not have.  We have only the
secondhand tale of the alleged cameraman who will not be
interviewed, so we cannot observe his emotional reactions.

What we found most compelling about the Fox TV show had nothing to
do with the autopsy: It was the testimony of Roswell native
Frankie Rowe, who recounted being threatened as a child by a
government interrogator after she handled some alleged evidence
from the crash.  We saw what seemed to be real emotion in her
eyes, and the performance struck us as more genuine than any
actress we have yet seen on film.  Cynical as we are about
television sound bites, faking such an automatic response on
extreme close-up seems to dwarf the challenges of reproducing an
alien body.

.....A THIRD SCENARIO.....

Between the bland black-and-white solutions of totally real and
totally hoax lies a far more interesting gray area.  Maybe the
autopsy film is an artificial creation, but motivated by something
other than money.  Can we explore such a theory without dropping
off the Deep End--into conspiracies galore and loss of all logical
discipline?  We'll give it a try as we digress below into rampant
speculation.

Let us suppose that the UFO cover-up is real and the government is
neither dumb nor nefarious.  In 1953, all alien information was
sequestered in its own secret division.  (Jarod calls it the
"Satellite Government" [DR#24], but that sounds too sinister for
us, as it begs the question of which government is really in
charge.  We prefer "special government entity" or SGE.)  Back in
the 1950s, total secrecy might have been appropriate.  The panic
associated with the "War of the Worlds" radio broadcast of 1938
still impressed the memories of those in power.  A determination
was made by competent authorities that the populace was not yet
ready for the news, or perhaps that the news was not ready for
them.  More time was needed for experts to study the problem--both
the aliens themselves and the possible public reaction--and to
prepared a plan.  This might be a very long-term plan.  The SGE
wanted flying saucers of its own before the news could be revealed
so the world would not appear so helpless.  These were built with
alien help--aliens who were neither good nor evil but simply alien
and apparently willing to humor us for a while.

Those who sponsored the cover-up and staffed the SGE believed in
what they were doing.  They were the finest minds of their
generation, men of good conscience who never expected the cover-up
to be permanent.  Theirs was to be a transitional program, albeit
one with a long timeframe.  The planners devoted much attention to
how the news should be released with minimal social disruption.
Ideally, elements of the truth should be let out gradually over
time, but how could this be done?  The SGE could not publicly
admit any limited alien contact without being forced to reveal it
all.  (Can you imagine the press of the planet demanding any
less?)  Like the fall of communism, once the wall cracks, it will
come down all at once, with no further opportunity for information
management.

The goal of gradual release would be to acclimate the population
emotionally to the form and ideas of the alien presence without
triggering a total release.  This can probably be done more
effectively by selective fictions than by truth, because fictions
can be controlled.  A hoax need contain only that portion of the
truth which is ready to be introduced to public.  The rest can be
a fabrication, just persuasive enough to get it distributed on the
Fox network.  Indeed, some part of the story must ultimately fall
apart to assure it doesn't go too far, as the hoax must eventually
be dispelled to make room for a larger truth.

Hence, the obvious presence of six fingers on the alien corpse
when the bulk of the Roswell and UFO cover-up lore describes a
four-fingered hand and any decent con-for-cash would provide the
same.  Apart from that detail and a few other deliberate
discrepancies, the autopsy film could be a re-staged version of an
actual event.  The SGE would certainly have the financial and
technical resources to produce such a low-budget flick, and it may
also have the dedicated staff who would do a better job than any
self-centered con artist.

This theory does not claim that the SGE controls the media or
otherwise manipulates public opinion.  No one can do that.  Our
own experience with all forms of major media--from Larry King to
"The New York Times" to the "Weekly World News"--has taught us that
the media is controlled by nothing more than ratings and the
pursuit of interesting and salable stories.  Every journalist we
have met would violently rebel at the idea of the government
telling them what to write.  They will not avoid an attractive
story, however, and someone can easily slip a hoax into the media
by understanding the needs of the market and tailoring the product
accordingly.

There are many things that a government entity, no matter how well
funded, cannot do.  You cannot buy human reliability.  Any agent
you recruit in the public sector is liable to crack under torture
or intense media coverage, or he could switch sides if he finds it
more profitable to write a tell-all book.  Thus, it is prudent
when introducing any hoax to avoid human contact as much as
possible.  The autopsy film fits the mold.  Our only link to the
source is promoter Ray Santilli.  He claims to have bought the
film from the cameraman, who is not available for interview.  Does
the cameraman exist?  To assure minimal vulnerability for the
hoaxers, he probably does--or at least someone playing his role to
Santilli.  The only requirement is to convince Santilli that the
story is plausible and that he will make a lot of money from it.
Santilli presents no risk then, even if under continuous media
pressure, because he is telling the truth as told to him and does
not know the source beyond that.

Another candidate for a sanctioned hoax might be the MJ-12 papers
[DR#29], which were supposedly delivered anonymously to TV
producer Jaime Shandera on an unmarked roll of film.  Due
primarily to Phil Klass's discovery that Truman's signature is a
reproduction, these documents are now widely regarded as fakes,
with bad-boy ufologist Bill Moore being the prime suspect.  Under
the gradual-release theory, though, Moore was only a victim.  The
documents might be essentially correct, although refined by the
SGE to retain deniability and release only a comfortable amount of
information.  Even if fake, the documents have had an emotional
effect, reinforcing the belief in the UFO community that an MJ-12
type organization must exist.

Although the foregoing is only a theory, it is a fairly elegant
one.  This "sanctioned hoax" scenario differs from other
conspiracy theories in that it proposes that the SGE is ultimately
working to promote the cause of truth and not against it.  It also
requires far fewer resources and less government omniscience than
a more far-reaching scenario.  If we felt it was morally right, we
at the Research Center could do the job ourselves with only a
limited staff plus the technical resources to generate fake
documents and films--talents known to be possessed by the CIA.
Then, it is only a matter of introducing these artifacts in some
discreet and anonymous way such that they cannot be traced back to
the source.

Some of the sanctioned hoaxes might take off in a big way, like
the autopsy film and the MJ-12 papers, while others could fall
flat and hardly be noticed.  It would be an opportunistic business
where you have to keep an eye on the UFO subculture and take
advantage of opportunities when they arise.  Whoever plans these
actions must be an avid watcher of the UFO field.  He subscribes
to the literature, attends conventions and is familiar with all of
the major ufologists, albeit probably from a distance to avoid any
compromise.  (He is not Phil Klass, by the way, who has too high a
profile, although he is certainly a watcher of Phil.)  He sees
himself as the guardian of the UFO movement, charged with
distracting it in the early years but now concerned with keeping
it on track.

Our mystery man is probably getting along in years, having started
with the program, like most of his colleagues, in the 50s or 60s.
His field is psychology, we suppose, and he was trained in the old
operant-conditioning school in which an organism is acclimated to
a traumatic stimulus by repeated exposure to lesser forms of it.
He himself is well conditioned.  He does not need to be told the
goals of his organization because he has fully internalized them,
and he has won the trust of superiors who has worked with for many
years.  This leaves him free to be creative, to seize an
opportunity and exploit it without having to deal with too much
bureaucracy.  He goes to his boss with a proposal, and the boss
asks, "What resources do you need?  How are we vulnerable if
fails?"  Then, if the concerns are answered, the boss says, "Okay,
let's do it," and all the requirements are provided.

Sounds like an interesting and challenging career.  The mystery
man does it well and is proud of his work, because he believes he
is moving toward a higher goal, a day when all of humanity might
know everything he does.  Although he is aware that his
organization will probably be disemboweled when the news gets out,
he is near or past retirement age and wants to escape from the
prison of silence in which he and his colleagues have been
trapped.  He knows as well as anyone that the truth will have to
be known, and he is working in good conscience toward that goal.
Unlike on "The X-Files," he does not kill anybody, although he might
embarrass them to death when they fall for one of his partial
frauds.  Ends justify the means, however, and no one is suckered
who did not set themselves up for it by their own ego, greed or
lack of intellectual discipline.

We cannot say that we believe this gray theory; we just leave the
door open to it.  One should not underestimate the power of simple
human greed, which is a less complicated explanation than any
government program.  We abhor conspiracy theories in general and
don't think the government can control society any more than it
does the weather.  Still, a "sanctioned hoax" program would be
relatively easy to sustain, requiring only limited personnel and
funding.  The only goal would be to introduce the proper stimulus
again and again, incorporating elements of the truth but not the
whole thing, so when the whole truth finally escapes it is no big
deal.  If the current autopsy film is a fake, that does not dilute
its real social and emotional effects.  If another autopsy film
were later released--the REAL film--it would cause no great
trauma because the world has the skills and maturity now to deal
with it.

.....JAROD'S OPINION.....

Jarod 2, the simulator designer, has been watching the autopsy
controversy and now appears to be getting sick and tired of it
like the rest of us.  He seems to go back and forth between
believing it a hoax and wondering if it might be real.  Jarod says
he was officially briefed about only a single saucer crash, one
near Kingman, Arizona, in 1953.  He knows nothing about Roswell
except what he has read in the UFO literature.  He points out one
curious detail, however:  On a photo of the autopsy alien shown on
the cover of MUFON UFO Journal  (August 1995), there appears to be
a teardrop-shaped scar on the left shoulder.  This, he says, looks
like a smallpox inoculation scar.  Most people raised in the
United States who are older than a certain age ought to have such
a scar, until smallpox was finally eradicated.  This suggests that
the poor dead alien, or at least his left shoulder, was raised
here on earth.

Jarod also says that the skin of the alien in the film is much too
fine.  It looks like human skin, whereas that of the aliens he
worked with was rougher.  He compares skin of his advisor-aliens
to human skin that has been magnified many times, so the pores and
wrinkles are more obvious.  Jarod's reluctance to draw a negative
conclusion on the film stems from his understanding that there is
more than one species of alien visiting earth.  However, all
species he knows of are Grays with only minor variations.

There are a couple of interesting parallels between the
cameraman's story and Jarod's.  We note this quote from the
cameraman's written statement as distributed on the net....

   Inside [the craft], the atmosphere was very heavy,  It was
   impossible to stay in longer than a few seconds without feeling
   very sick.  Therefore it was decided to analyze it back at base
   so it was loaded onto a flattop and taken to Wright-Patterson,
   which is where I joined it.

Sounds like Jarod's account.  In DR24, he said that in the Arizona
crash, an entry team went into the craft on-site but later came
out very sick.  Then the craft, still humming, was loaded onto a
tank hauler and taken to the Nevada Test Site (or Area 51
perhaps).  Later, after communication was established, the
visiting aliens turned off the hum, and everything was okay.
Jarod speculates that the "heavy atmosphere" is a deliberate
security device.  (We would rate it better than both Lo-Jack and
The Club for deterring flying saucer theft.)

One difference, however, is that Northwest Arizona to Southern
Nevada is a relatively short haul through an unpopulated area,
provided Las Vegas is avoided.  (It was then a small, wholesome,
Mob-run city.)  Socorro to Wright-Patterson (or Wright Field at
the time) would be a very long haul across half a continent, past
many places where this wide 10-meter payload would hardly escape
notice.  Why carry something big, unknown and potentially unstable
any further than you had to?  To work with an immensely valuable
artifact that might conceivably explode, you would want a lot of
empty land around you.  White Sands Proving Ground, just a few
dozen miles from Socorro and where the first atomic bomb was
tested, would have been the logical choice, not Wright Field or
even Los Alamos, which had the brains but also a lot of valuable
assets at risk.  At least you would take the craft to White Sands
first, and then--months or years later when you have determined it
is safe--you might move it elsewhere.  If there were no compatible
facilities there, they would have been built immediately.  Every
other option would have been considered before hauling this
possible time bomb across the U.S. heartland.

Another match between the two stories is a "computer keyboard"
shown in the cameraman's debris footage.  (This was not shown on
Fox but appears in the full Santilli video tape and has been
circulated as a still on the net.)  A military officer, shown from
the neck down, holds a flat panel that bears the molded outline of
two six-fingered hands.  The aliens presumably place their hands
against this panel to communicate with their hardware.  In fact,
Jarod described a similar control panel to us a month or two
before this portion of the Santilli film came to light.  He was
discussing the differences between alien avionics, which were
unusable to us, and the human-built versions, which more resembled
the instrumentation on a conventional aircraft.  Humans were not
capable of flying the original alien craft, which may be one of
the reasons they had to build their own.

Jarod says he recently asked his boss about the autopsy film
(since Jarod still has a boss and remains on-call in spite of his
retirement).  The boss said there were three such autopsy films
floating around, but he would not comment on the current one.
Jarod also asked about the "Hungarian" or other strange writing he
used to see on technical documents he worked with.  His boss
replied, "If you don't remember, I'm not going to tell you."

___-- POSSESSED BY FORCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL -----

Deep within Psychospy dwells a parasite.  Most of the time it lies
dormant and leaves us alone, but every once in a while it takes
control of our body, triggers violent spasmodic convulsions,
bursts from the center of our chest like that serpent-thing in the
movie "Alien" and hisses to us its demands....

"Road Trip!"

Cut to the desert, somewhere in New Mexico.  We're screaming down
the highway at five hundred miles an hour, sun roof open, wind in
our scalp.  Got the Stones blasting through the sound system: "I
CAN'T GET NO... SATISFACTION!"  It's Psychospy's 1995 Flying
Saucer Crash Site/Underground Alien Bases Tour, just concluded.
This year's tour was sponsored by Motel 6, Sizzler Steak Houses
(offering adequate buffets outside Vegas) and the Garmen 45
Handheld GPS.  The latter is a new addition to our road trips and
allows us to convey to our readers exactly where the saucers
crashed that aren't there anymore.

We deliberately avoided Roswell this time--It's been overdone.--
but we found a lot of other neat places in Arizona and New Mexico
where flying saucers may or may not have descended.  We visited
the area just north of Kingman [vicinity of 35d28', 114d03'],
where Jarod says that the most important landing took place.  Then
we explored the Aztec/Farmington area of New Mexico, site of the
often debunked Scully/Steinman crash [36d52.642', 107d50.279'] as
well as the location of a mass UFO sighting in 1950 (Newspaper
headline: "HUGE SAUCER ARMADA JOLTS FARMINGTON").  Next we went on
to Socorro, NM, to find the Lonnie Zamora landing site of 1964
[34d02.597', 106d53.801'].  Then, we sought the 1947 crash site
described by the cameraman of the autopsy film, supposedly west of
Socorro.  We will report on our full tour in the next DR,
including Dulce, Sunspot, White Sands, Davis-Monthan, Marana and
Biosphere II.  Until then, we have posted on WWW a detailed report
on our visit to the cameraman's site, as it seems timely.

In brief, our egomaniac opponent Michael Hesemann, Germany's own
precious version of Sean Morton, announced at an Aug. 20 UFO
conference in England that Ray Santilli, the only spokesman for
the cameraman, had given Hesemann instructions on how to find the
crash site where the alien in the film was recovered.  It was
supposed to be near a dry lake south of the highway from Socorro
to Magdalena.  We followed Hesemann's instructions, as given at
the conference, and indeed found the site as he had described it
from his own visit.  However, the "dry lake" was misnomer; it was
instead a small cattle watering reservoir.  In any case, this
would be a fine place to crash a flying saucer, keeping with the
apparent alien preference for crashing in the deserts of the
American Southwest, away from any population center, but not a
place that's totally inaccessible to military recovery.  "Yoohoo,
we've crashed!"

----- FOLLOW-UP ON "EXECUTIVE BRIEFING" -----

Many readers responded to our request for the origin of the
"Executive Briefing" document reprinted in DR#29.  Timothy Good
points us to pages 117-121 of his book "Alien Contact" for the
history.  This document was given to the world by Bill Moore, who
says he was allowed to photograph it and copy its contents.  So
much cloak and dagger!

   Researcher William Moore, who has developed a number of high-
   level contacts in the intelligence community since 1978
   (including Richard Doty), received a phone call telling him that
   some information was to be made available to him, but that he
   would have to go and collect it in person. "You will be
   receiving some instructions," the caller said. "You must follow
   them carefully or the deal is off."

   The instructions were convoluted, involving directions given
   on the phone at various airports as Bill made his way across the
   United States from Arizona. At the final destination, a motel in
   upstate New York, Bill was instructed to be ready at five
   o'clock. At precisely that time, an individual came to the door
   carrying a sealed brown envelope. "You have exactly nineteen
   minutes," the man said. "You may do whatever you wish with this
   material during that time, but at the end of that time, I must
   have it back. After that, you are free to do what you wish."

   Inside the envelope were eleven pages of what purported to be

   the document and read its contents into a tape recorder. "Both
   are permitted," said the courier.  "You have seventeen minutes
   remaining."

his resume and other things, is also expected to vanish from the
UFO scene, although he doesn't know it yet and is still making
public appearances.)

details of his job, which he could not discuss but transparently
hinted at.  He said he flew to his job from Las Vegas for three-
day stints and that Glenn Campbell was a "problem child" who had
been fined six hundred dollars for withholding evidence (incorrect
but close enough).  At the time, the female knew of
