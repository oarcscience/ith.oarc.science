    Things to beware of in 1997:

    Earth, wind, and fire.  Or, more preciesely, earthquakes, tornados,
    and volcanos (new ones).  The weather, it is a-changin.

     Friday, March 28, 1997
     Rendezvous with a comet

     Cultists planned to grab UFO
     trailing Hale-Bopp

     C0PLEY NEWS SERVICE

    RANCHO SANTA FE, Calif. - The  39 members of the Heaven's Gate
    cult who poisoned themselves in a Rancho Santa Fe mansion
    apparently believed they were going to hitch a ride to a
    better life aboard a space ship trailing the Hale-Bopp comet.

    They had systematically planned their deaths for months, even
    years. And they took great care not to leave a mess behind as
    they executed their scheme, leaving their belongings packed
    neatly alongside their bodies and their identification in
    their shirt pockets.

    "We know whatever happens to us after we leave our bodies is a
    step forward," a pale, balding man believed to be the group's
    65-year-old leader, Marshall Applegate, said on a videotape
    distributed before the mass suicide.

    He added ominously, "Your only chance to evacuate is to leave
    with us."

    As authorities worked around the clock Thursday to uncover
    the details of one of the nation's worst mass suicides:

    Solemn medical examiner's  personnel removed the bodies
    and began conducting autopsies.

    Authorities said the poison was alcohol and phenobarbitol - a barbiturate,
    anti-seizure and tranquilizing drug.

    It was determined that 21 of the dead were women, and that the ages of the
    dead ranged from 26 to 72. They died in separate groups: 15 the first day,
    15 the second and nine the third day.

    Details about the cult emerged from World Wide Web pages, cult watchers,
    clients and acquaintances.

    And hundreds called a toll-free number set up for those who fear their
    relatives are among the dead.

    In Sacramento, Gov. Pete Wilson called the mass suicide "terribly sad" and
    offered state aid for the investigation. In Washington, President Clinton
    called the deaths "heartbreaking, sickening, shocking."

    The group's members left behind two videotapes explaining their beliefs and
    a trail of propaganda on the World Wide Web.

    Authorities found a letter in the Colina Norte house explaining the group's
    philosophies, but didn't disclose details.

    There also was a computer, left on, with a digital image of the Hale-Bopp
    comet. "We haven't had the ability or time to process whatever information
    is on that computer," said sheriff's Cmdr. Alan Fulmer, who had 50 homicide
    detectives and evidence technicians on the case.

    All 39 bodies were loaded into three refrigerated trucks and delivered to
    the San Diego County Medical Examiner's office. The last bodies left at
    9:45 a.m.

    The names of the dead were not released because their relatives were still
    being notified. Autopsies and toxicology tests were expected to continue
    through the weekend, with assistance from Los Angeles County coroners.

    Authorities seemed impressed by the group's neatness and thorough planning.

    Medical Examiner Brian Blackbourne described the house as "immaculate," and
    noted that the identification documents the dead left behind were a "great
    help" in identifying the bodies.

    The group's members took had packed their clothing in black suitcases,
    donned brand-new matching black Nike sneakers, dark shirts and black pants,
    neatly laid their eyeglasses beside them, and followed a printed recipe.
    According to Blackbourne, the recipe read, "Take this package of pudding or
    applesauce, put the medicine in it and stir, eat it quickly, drink the
    vodka mixture and lay back and rest quietly."

    The living covered the faces of the dead with purple shrouds and disposed
    of plastic bags that may have been used to hasten death.

    The bodies of two members were found with plastic bags over their heads.
    Investigators believe they drank their poison last, lingering to place the
    soft fabric over the corpses of the others. Copies of the recipe were found
    near some bodies.

    Sheriff's deputies initially concluded that all of the dead were men
    because they all wore buzz haircuts.

    Officials offered no theories as to why the cult members took their own
    lives, but said the members appeared happy about their decision on the
    videotapes.

    "What I saw (on the tape) was an individual who was very upbeat, very
    outgoing, who did not appear to be upset or frightened with what they were
    talking about doing," Fulmer said.

    The group was apparently founded back in the 1970s by Applewhite and his
    partner, Bonnie Lu Nettles. The couple, called "Bo" and "Peep," believed
    that death could be overcome with help from humans traveling in a space
    ship.

    That cult disbanded, but it apparently reformed under a new name. A man
    called Do pleaded for people to join him and his followers on a videotape
    called "Last chance to evacuate earth before it's recycled."

    He said, "This planet is about to be recycled, refurbished, started over.
    ... The purpose of this tape is to warn you that this is about to happen,
    and that it's going to happen very soon."

    The group came to San Diego County in the fall.

    Members rented two other houses in North County before moving in October
    into the multi-million Rancho Santa Fe estate,which was reportedly rented
    for $7,000 a month.

    The 9,200-square-foot house is a modernized Spanish design, with a plain
    tan stucco exterior and oversized picture windows beneath a red-tile roof.

    It sits atop a hill covered with carefully tended gardens that are filled
    with palms, red Japanese maples, red-and-white roses and stands of
    flowering birds of paradise.

    Cult members called it their "temple."

    Sleeping in bunk beds, they quietly produced Web pages for such clients as
    a polo club, a company selling British cars and car accessories, and a firm
    selling compact disks.

    As they produced cyber advertisements, the group's members were planning
    their deaths, or "ascension to a higher level," as they call it.

    Last July, someone from the group posted apocalyptic messages on hundreds
    of specialized Internet bulletin boards. The five-line message, terse and
    elliptical, reads: "How and When the door to the Physical/Kingdom Level
    Above Human May be Entered/Organized Religions are Killers of Souls/UFL's
    and Space Aliens - Sorting Good from Bad/Final Warning for Possible
    Survivors".

    The group's leader posted a much longer message on a religious newsgroup
    that concludes, "The human kingdom was never meant to be anything but a
    steppingstone - a realized hell that must be evacuated with the help of a
    representative from the next evolutionary level - the kingdom of heaven."

    They hadn't talk much to neighbors since moving into the house. But members
    of the group were seen as polite, meticulous and, despite their odd
    behavior, quite intelligent by those who may have encountered the cult the
    most in the past few months: the real estate agents trying to sell the
    14-year-old house.

    Marvin Caldwell showed the home at least twice to prospective buyers. He
    said the living room appeared to have been turned into a meeting room with
    a large television.

    "They were bright mentally," Caldwell said. "They would be candidates for
    Mensa (a group for geniuses). I didn't see them as oddballs."

    When real estate agent Scott Warren showed the house last week, most of the
    residents were dressed casually, in jeans and T-shirts. "No one spoke, they
    were very quiet," he said. "They seemed quite religious."

    Five members of the group visited agent Kim Sanford's office last fall.
    "Their skin didn't look like it had any protein," she said. "It was
    transparent."

    Several real estate brokers believed they met the group's leader. Warren
    said a tall, thin man who called himself "Father John" escorted him and his
    client through the house. He described him as intimidating but nice.

    "He was very cordial, ... very calm," he said.
