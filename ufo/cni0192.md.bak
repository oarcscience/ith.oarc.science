    ========================================================

    1) HUGE UFO FLAP REPORTED IN AUSTRALIA

    CNI News has received a preliminary report of a huge UFO flap now underway in
    Australia. Details are very sketchy and we are awaiting further information,
    but bring you this report as sent to us by Leslie Anne Mannering
    (breeders@powerup.com.au). Leslie writes:

    "It has been incredible. International officials are coming from everywhere
    to look at the evidence (radar tracks) and interview witnesses which include
    our RAAF, police force and thousands of Australian citizens nationwide. My
    girlfriend saw one the other morning in broad daylight and she is a skeptic
    in every respect. I sense a feeling of urgency, that something is about to
    happen.

    "These UFO's have been seen flying squadron style perfect distances apart.
    There are so many witnesses to these events that the government officials
    simply can't pass it off as rubbish. It's been on our television, on our
    radios, and in the newspaper."

    CNI News has requested further information and will continue to follow this
    developing story.

    2) ANTIQUITIES EXPERTS HANCOCK, BAUVAL REPORT STRANGE POLITICAL INTRIGUES IN
    EGYPT AS SPHINX DEBATE HEATS UP

    [CNI News thanks John J. Mercieca of Malta UFO Research for sending this
    report, based on notes taken during a conference at Imperial College, London,
    on May 25.]

    Graham Hancock [author of "Fingerprints of the Gods"] and Robert Bauval
    [author of "The Orion Mystery"] had some disturbing news from Egypt. John
    Anthony West, who has previously demonstrated that the Sphinx and pyramids at
    Giza are much older than previously thought, and also discovered a secret
    chamber under the Sphinx's left paw, was then booted out of Egypt by Dr. Zahi
    Hawass (Director of Egyptian Antiquities) on the grounds that West was
    attributing the Sphinx & pyramids to an ancient lost civilization and not to
    the Egyptians. This was total rubbish, according to Hawass. He actually said
    that West was part of a "Zionist plot against Egyptians."

    Rudolf Gantenbrink, the German robotics engineer who discovered a secret door
    at the end of a supposed "air shaft" in the Queen's chamber of the Great
    Pyramid using the Upuat robot, was also declared persona non grata.

    Now Zahi Hawass has been sponsored by a multi-millionaire [name not given]
    who happens to be a member of the Edgar Cayce society (Association for
    Research and Enlightenment) to open the secret chamber below the sphinx. A
    Canadian engineer who has been chosen by Hawass to use another robot to open
    the "air shaft" door in September also happens to be a member of the Edgar
    Cayce society and is also connected to the multi-millionaire.

    Edgar Cayce, the famed American psychic, predicted in 1933 that a secret
    chamber would be discovered under the Sphinx that contained a repository of
    Atlantean knowledge.

    Zahi Hawass has participated in a 7 minute promo film to try to get someone
    to produce a direct "live" opening of the secret chamber.

    Hancock and Bauval were contacted to participate in this live opening, but
    one of the conditions was that they had to publicly denounce John Anthony
    West as a fraud.  They refused.  Meanwhile, the multi-millionaire has
    allegedly threatened to sue Bauval and Hancock for libel for associating him
    with the Edgar Cayce society and the Sphinx chamber opening.

    Not long ago, Zahi Hawass said that the "secret chamber" under the Sphinx was
    just a natural cavity in the rock; but he now admits that there may be
    something in it after all.

    Meanwhile, Bauval may have discovered the position of another secret
    underground chamber below the RUMP of the Sphinx, different from the known
    position of the secret chamber discovered by John Anthony West in 1991 under
    the paws of the sphinx. This new chamber is being called by Bauval and
    Hancock the Genesis chamber.

    3) NATIVE AMERICANS CALL FOR WORLD PEACE AND PRAYER DAY

    [CNI News thanks Robert Rouse for sending this item. As previously reported
    in CNI News, two "deities" appeared recently on the Navajo Indian reservation
    to warn the people of difficult times ahead. Now a spokesman for the Lakota
    (Sioux) Nation makes an appeal based upon the same concern.]

    I, Arvol Looking Horse, 19th Generation Keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo
    Calf Pipe for the Lakota, Dakota, Nakota Nation ask that all Nations upon
    Mother Earth declare June 21st, 1996 World Peace and Prayer Day. According to
    spiritual leaders and Elders who gathered at the United Nations to present
    their prophesies -- and again at Six Nations, Canada -- the "signs" of
    Indigenous people's prophesies have shown themselves. The prophesies tell us
    it is time to begin mending the Sacred Hoop and begin global healing by
    working towards world peace and harmony.

    The Birth of the White Buffalo Calf lets us know we're at a crossroads --
    either return to balance or face global disaster. It is our duty to return
    back to sacred places and pray for world peace -- if we do not do this, our
    children will suffer.

    At Grey Horn Butte, before the White Buffalo Woman brought the Sacred Pipe to
    our ancestors, a Seer was traveling in the Sacred Black Hills -- PaHa Sapa,
    "heart of everything that is." The Seer came upon a large tipi. When he went
    into the tipi, he saw the Sacred Pipe in the North and the Sacred Bundle of
    Bows and Arrows in the South. According to the Star Knowledge there are six
    stars which designate six sacred sites within the Black Hills. These places
    are sacred places to pray. We are told there is a sacred site every hundred
    miles around Mother Earth. We ask all people to return to these places and
    pray from their hearts with us. The ceremony begins at 10 a.m. South Dakota
    (Mountain) time.

    It has been decided, according to the Star Knowledge, that June 21st is the
    time to pray. Indigenous people of Turtle Island will begin their spiritual
    journey on horseback from Wahpeton, Saskatchewan, Canada to Grey Horn Butte
    (known as Devil's Tower) in the Black Hills of Wyoming. There, Indigenous
    peoples will pray with the Sacred Bundle Keepers to begin the restoration of
    peace and balance. We ask all Peoples to begin organizing their ceremonies at
    their sacred sites or in the manner which they pray so that they will be
    praying at the same time as we are from their sacred center.

    So far, we have spoken to leaders around the world and each has committed to
    work towards supporting June 21st, 1996. We ask all people of all faiths to
    respond and support our efforts towards world peace and harmony -- our circle
    of life where there is no ending and no beginning. May Peace be with you All.

    4) CHINA OPENS MUSEUM DEDICATED TO CHINESE "BIGFOOT"

    [CNI News thanks James Sutton for forwarding this story.]

    BEIJING (Reuter) -- China has opened a museum dedicated to the elusive "Big
    Foot" ape-man said to roam the Shennongjia Nature Reserve in central Hubei
    province, the Xinhua news agency said Sunday (June 2).

    The museum displays samples of reddish hair and plaster models of huge
    footprints collected over the years that are said to prove the existence of
    the creature, which local residents call the "Wild Man," Xinhua said.

    Opened last month, the museum also features documents and pictures of various
    scientific and exploratory operations mounted over the years to track down
    the creature.

    "All the materials in the museum are genuine," the agency quoted Chen Renlin,
    Chairman of the Shennongjia Cultural Research Society and self-proclaimed
    "Big Foot" expert, as saying.

    Since the 1950s, both scientists and amateurs have searched in vain for the
    creature in the Shennongjia valley, as well as for its cousin the Yeti in the
    Himalaya mountains.

    5) WASHINGTON STATE IS JUST WILD ABOUT BIGFOOT

    [CNI News thanks our occasional columnist of the weird, Bufo Calvin, for the
    following.]

    by Bufo Calvin

    Readers may be aware of the ordinance in Skamania County, Washington, which
    serves to protect Bigfoot by making it a felony to commit "...premeditated,
    wilful (sic) and wanton slaying of any such creature..."  Well, a
    correspondent sent me a brief note about a county which went even further and
    protected bigfoot habitat. It took me months to track it all down (I didn't
    want to run with the story until I had the document in my hand), but I've got
    it!

    King County, Washington, lists "Bipedus giganticus (Sasquatch)" on the list
    of mammals "...observed during wetland field visits."

    You see, if your land is declared a wetland, it cannot be farmed because of
    the destruction of habitat. The chief of King County's Agriculture and
    Resource Land Section explained that the list included "...citizen
    observations and there's no judgment made about whether or not the
    observations were real or imagined." In essence, they don't call people liars
    who say they see a short-tailed weasel, so why should they call them liars if
    they say they see a Sasquatch?

    Interestingly, one can deduce that the list originally said "Bigfoot" [rather
    than Sasquatch]. It is located alphabetically between beaver and bobcat and
    is the only one out of alphabetical order.  Also, the symbol is BF, the only
    one composed of letters not appearing in the common name. I would guess they
    changed it to reduce the controversy.

    This is Bufo saying, "If =everything= seemed normal, that =would= be weird!
