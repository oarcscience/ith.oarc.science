### FOREWORD

Perhaps my parents never realized the puns that would be made on my name
when they christened me Richard Sharpe Shaver. Under ordinary
circumstances the puns would have been of little consequence, but
because of the amazing fact of my amazing memory of the life of another
person, long dead, it has been incredibly hard for me to speak
convincingly and to make people believe in me. Invariably I get that
oh-so-funny remark, "Sharp-shaver, eh? A regular cut-up, eh, kid!"
accompanied by a sly dig in the ribs and a very stupid, "Get it?" How
can a man get a serious audience after that?

And yet, there it is for all who wish—to pun and pun again. If I achieve
nothing else at least you may laugh, and to laugh is to be physically
and mentally healthy. For those of you who will read on and carefully
weigh what I am about to tell you I am convinced there will be no
thought of puns. Instead, when you consider the real truths behind what
I say—and even better, experiment and study to corroborate them—it seems
to me to be inevitable that you will forget that I am Richard Sharpe
Shaver, and instead, am what science chooses to very vaguely define as
the racial memory receptacle of a man (or should I say a being?) named
Mutan Mion, who lived many thousands of years ago in Sub Atlan, one of
the great cities of ancient Lemuria!

I myself cannot explain it. I know only that I remember Lemuria!
Remember it with a faithfulness that I accept

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

with the absolute conviction of a fanatic. And yet, I am not a fanatic;
I am a simple man, a worker in metal, employed in a steel mill in
Pennsylvania. I am as normal as any of you who read this and gifted with
much less imagination than most of you!

What I tell you is not fiction! How can I impress that on you as
forcibly as I feel it must be impressed? But then. what good to impress
it upon those who will crack wise about me being a "sharp-shaver"? I can
only hope that when I have told the story of Mutan Mion as I remember it
you will believe—not because I sound convincing or tell my story in a
convincing manner, but because you will see the truth in what I say, and
will realize, as you must, that many of the things I tell you are not a
matter of present day scientific knowledge and yet are true!

I fervently hope that such great minds as Einstein, Carrel, and the late
Crile check the things that I remember. I am no mathematician; I am no
scientist. I have studied all the scientific books I can get—only to
become more and more convinced that I remember true things. But surely
someone can definitely say that I am wrong or that I am right,
especially in such things as the true nature of gravity, or matter, of
light, of the cause of age and many other things that the memory of
Mutan Mion has expressed to me so definitely as to be conviction itself.

I intend to put down these things, and I invite—challenge!—any of you to
work on them; to prove or disprove, as you like. Whatever your goal, I
do not care. I care only that you believe me or disbelieve me with
enough fervor to do some real work on those things I will propound. The
final result may well stagger the science of the world.

I want to thank editor Ray Palmer, in whose "fiction" magazine, Amazing
Stories, the stories in this book were

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

first published, for his open mind and for the way he has received the
things I have told him in addition to what I have written in this story
of Mutan Mion of ancient Lemuria. It began when he published my ancient
alphabet in "Discussions" <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) and
requested the readers to carry out checks of their own. I myself did not
realize the extent of the alphabetic (more properly phonetic) language.
But surely there must be tremendous significance in the fact that the
alphabet fits into every language to which it has been applied, to the
amazing percentage of 75% in the German to 94% in the ancient Egyptian!
Even in Chinese and Japanese it ranked consistent nine out of ten times.

To me it is tragic that the only way I can tell my story is in the guise
of fiction. And yet, I am thankful for the opportunity to do even this;
and to editor Ray Palmer I express my unbounded gratitude. I know that
if even a few of you go to the lengths he has gone to check many of the
things I remember, a beginning will have been made to something, the
ending of which (if ending there is) awes me beyond my poor power to
express my feelings.

—RICHARD S. SHAVER.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[3:1](irl01.htm#fr_0.md) January, 1945 issue of
AMAZING STORIES. Some of the reports by readers were subsequently
published, but the great majority were not. These reports proved to be
the most amazing the editor has ever received on anything published in
his magazine. They would seem to indicate beyond all doubt that the
"ancient language" of Mr. Shaver is part of an original "mother tongue"
from which all Earthly language, have sprung. For example, the name
Mutan Mion, broken down into the letters and sounds of this ancient
language becomes MU—"man"; T—"integration," "growth"; AN—"animal." MION
means "manchild seed." So the name means "man spore cultured to new
forms by integration growth forces." In other words, a synthetic
mutation by the use of force or rays.—Ed.
