### CHAPTER III

#### Terror in Tean City

That evening Arl took me to a dance. Never had I known that there could
be such pleasure! And as a part of it all I discovered that my education
was to continue through every waking hour, whether in scheduled class or
not. There was so much to be learned from actual living! And Arl, it
seemed, was determined that nothing should be lacking in my education.
Nor did I object, for nothing suited me better than to have her,
beautiful tail and all, showing her friendship and interest.

The dance, she told me on the way to the hall in a rollat car, was very
scientifically handled by trained technicons. The stimulation of human
attraction between male and female, she told me, was due to the
generation of many kinds of tiny and fecund spores which grow and are
released upon stimulus by male and female. The male spores grow in the
female and vice versa, just as pollen between flowers. This cell pollen
and the sensation of its growing presence is love. I could imagine the
immense fecundity given this process by the strength of the Atlan race,
whose growth and youth <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md) never cease.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

We arrived at the place where the dance was to be held, and I found a
great room, tastefully draped, and decorated by paintings that depicted
such scenes of love and joy and health as I have never before seen. Just
as the paintings at the Hall of Symbols held forth that invitation to
join in the elevation of the race, so did these paintings show the way
to participation in love and joy.

The dance had already begun and we joined the throng on the floor.
Almost instantly I was aware of the influence of stimulating
electromagnetic frequencies. I felt the flow of exd of appropriate
attunements; my nerve cells responded in a thrilling fashion.

The stimulating rays strongly ionized the air of the hall; making it
extremely conductive to the electric pressure of the body aura, so that
the dancers were intensely aware of each other. The consequently
augmented vital aura of the cell pollen permeated the hall. It was
absorbed by my body, and by that of lovely, faun-legged Arl snuggled in
my arms, and by all the young, ecstatic bodies of those who danced about
us. Under the stimulus, we wove intricate patterns on the gleaming
floor; and the odor music of the Atlans wove into the sound music many
scent accompaniments. These scents are of the most penetrative and
nutrient of all the food chemicals, feeding the nerves as they are
driven into the body by strong sound waves of a penetrative frequency.

In the enhanced delight of the dance I was oblivious of all but the
bundle of vitality to which my pulse and soul

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

were synchronized, and my arms held Arl as a treasure beyond value.

Then, as I lost myself in pleasure, it happened. The madness of the fear
that was upon Tean City struck; and for the first time in my life I knew
the true meaning of terror!

Arl screamed, and pushing me from her, pointed to the edge of the dance
floor. There the great shoulders of a horned son of a Titan hunched, one
big hand clutching in desperate agony at the folds of a drape, the other
pointing up and out to indicate the path of the ray that played upon
him. Even in the face of death his only thought was to tell what he knew
of the fear; and to point out its direction so that the technicons might
answer with a ray of their own.

But nothing checked the ray; and I realized that contrary to all the
usual rules there was no guard ray on duty. No wonder there was fear in
Atlan! Slowly the huge youth's face turned black, his legs buckled, he
fell and rolled over on his back, tongue protruding and eyes staring. He
was dead.

His friends rushed to him, but the deadly ray had not ceased. It played
first on one figure and then on another; each victim rolling in turn to
the floor, face black with death.

"By the Elder Gods!" I swore to myself at the realization that no guard
ray was going to protect us. "It is true; our perfect government is not
so perfect after all!"

I stood as though oblivious to the fact that death might strike my way
too. I could only look and rage within me at the death that played about
the recently joy-filled hall. Within me the stimulating rays still
caused an elation, but it was submerged beneath the surge of wrath that
made my blood hot.

Arl was tugging at my elbow, the canny will to live of the female
evident on her face in an expression of anxiety

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

and calculation. Together we left the hall, taking a route along which
her clicking hooves led me. We kept with a group of young Atlans who
walked, without panic or the impulse to run, toward the parked rollats.
I knew why; they feared to attract a spy-ray to themselves.

Arl's fingers pressed warningly on my arm, and I heard her whisper, her
voice low, casual. An excited tone might have attracted the curiosity of
the mad mind behind the black deaths, who must even now be surveying the
scene of his mad acts of killing in grisly satisfaction.

"Listen to that man just behind us—"

I listened. His voice was also casual—held no excited note. In his voice
was the cultured note that was evidence of one who has absorbed much of
the vast education obtainable in Tean City.—"also heard that what lies
behind the fear and death here is the mad wish of certain rodite to
appropriate the whole fleet of ships prepared for the migration and go
to the new sun leaving nothing behind alive with brains enough to build
and fly ships in pursuit. Thus they would have the new sun's clean light
entirely for themselves and their future seed."

A selfish thing, indeed! But more mad than selfish. Such a view could
only be the result of detrimental err.

The speaker went on. "We, the mediocro, know how fecund life can be, but
we also know the madness of refusing all of the normal units of life's
fabric the right to existence and growth. No social fabric can be built
of dull and lifeless robots which are so besotted with detrimental
energy that they refuse the least of the units of the fabric their right
to growth and intelligence. Therein lies the strength of the social
fabric—the unit's realization of its own self and its place in the
whole. The whole basis of a fuller life is the acquisition by mutual
effort, the backing on which is woven the social pattern of the fabric
itself."

I heard another voice, answering in agreement, yet with a troubled note
evident in its tones, as if the speaker felt

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

that agreement alone was not enough; that simply denouncing a thing that
was as evil as this would not be enough. "Yes, this murderous effort is
doomed to failure. The intelligent members of the guilty rodite must
realize that such murder of the normal life unit is the refusal of their
own right to share in the fruits of the social project. They must
realize that such men as the Titan youth they killed have a potential
value as great as their own."

Another voice chimed in. "Then why is it refused recognition? If they
are intelligent, then why do they act so detrimentally? It must occur to
them soon, or it will be too late."

"Unless they are all mad," said the first speaker. "The sane unit of
such a project will see that the basic unit right is inherent to their
own success, and realize that destroying those rights will wreck their
own plans. The only thing it can he is the explanation a Titan growth
technicon offered—that some rodite have been detrimentally charged by
disintegrant coil leaks . . ."

I could not help breaking into the conversation.

"That is right! The thing has been explained to me that way; as a
detrimental hypnosis in which the ego—or self-will—the self recognition
of the mind centers confuses its self-originated impulses with the
exterior-originated detrimental impulses to destroy. Such a condition is
called dero, <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md) or detrimental energy
robotism. The thing is

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

simple enough, but I cannot understand how it could happen here in Tean
City, where perfection in romantics is so old. Such an occurrence is
guarded against by many battle ro, by great organic battery brains
raised for just that purpose. How could it happen?"

The two Titans looked at me and shook their heads. They knew as little
as I how it could be.

"Well, it couldn't, but it did!" Arl said with feminine logic, and
taking me by the arm, led the way to a rollat. In a moment we were
speeding away from the dangerous area. Beside me Arl relaxed with a
sigh, and I felt her trembling with reaction.

I put an arm around her. "Brave girl," I whispered.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

We were soon nearing Arl's apartment, and looking down at her fresh,
young face, I felt a wave of worry pass through me.

"I wish we were under that new sun right now; on those fresh-born
planets of life with clean new coordinating mechanisms under rodite we
ourselves selected and could therefore trust. I fear that the migration
has been too long delayed—the old sun's disintegrant pressure upon the
unseen base of our life is now too great for anything else to happen
than what happened tonight. Can we help to strive against this immense
err, deep-seated in the control minds about us as it must be; or must we
flee at once, before they make impossible our flight, thinking of it has
a danger of tale bearing?"

But Arl's lips were on mine as the rollat slowed before her home, an
effective quietus to my dangerous words, and my mind no longer dwelt on
the fear—nor imagined the embrace of a six-armed giant Sybyl female or
the crushing coils of a snake woman about me!—for it was too busy
recording the ecstatic sensations of the intense vital charge the
faun-legged girl threw into her embrace. My mind gave up its worry in
Arl's soft contact.

The next day I entered the classroom and found it empty. I went to the
incubation laboratory and found several other early students standing
there in silent consternation, the fear welling up almost to openness in
their eyes. The Titan was not present, nor were any of his attendants.
Some of the embryos were dead, others half-smothered; because no
attendant had turned on the filtered, enriched air tanks which kept
their nutrient fluid supply aerated. I started toward them, but a young
son of a Titan stopped me.

"I turned them on," he said in low, evenly-measured tones.

"Where is the Titan?" I asked.

"No one knows," was the answer I got from all.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

Other students came in now, among them Arl. She came to my side, but
remained silent, troubled.

We waited a short time. Then a student called tutor center, to inquire.
He turned to us with a peculiar look in his eyes.

"They say he is ill!"

"Ill?" The exclaimed question burst from all of us. In Atlan this was
startling. Illness is almost unheard of; a rarity
[existent](errata.htm#3.md) only on the space frontiers where new varieties
of germs were sometimes troublesome.

The news brought Arl close to me, her silky-furred tail trembling as
shudders shook her slim body. "Mutan, I am afraid," she whispered.

Her fear transmitted itself to me, and the thought came into my mind
that this room was not safe. The same thought obviously had come to the
others, because our movement toward the exit was as though by mutual
accord. There was obviously some awful connection between the black
deaths and the Titan's strange non-appearance. Yesterday the Titan had
said a guard ray was on while he spoke to us so gravely of the fear—Had
that guard ray been no guard at all? Had those evil rodite penetrated
the guard ray, heard his words, known the Titan as a menace to their
plan?

The: class was dismissed—this time by fear!

And somehow I knew that the thought in my mind was in the mind of all.
We had the same knowledge the Titan had. We were in the same danger. We
were marked for disappearance, illness, or the black death! We must
flee, now or never!

Proof of the thoughts of the others came almost instantly. As we trooped
in assumed light-heartedness down the tunnel toward the rollat ways one,
of the accompanying youths proposed a picnic in the forest to celebrate
the unexpected holiday. He said it loudly in a gay voice, and the others
chorused their delighted approval, a delight that

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Arl and I feigned
too. All fell in with the project, the unspoken desire to flee the city
strong in our breasts, our anticipation of being together among the
trees, which [subterranean](errata.htm#4.md) dwellers seldom see, strong
too.

I raced ahead with Arl, shouting [gaily](errata.htm#5.md), "Let me lead you
to the elevators." There was meaning in my voice, and intent in my mind.
I was not forgetting my promise to my friend, the control-man.

We reached the shaft that led to Sub Atlan, from which we would take
another lift to surface Mu. There, as we shot upward, I whispered the
news to the control-man. "The terror is loose in Tean City," I
concluded. "Escape as soon as you can. If at all possible, beg off from
another descent and be away. There is great danger for all whom they
suspect are aware of them."

He retained a straight face, but I could see the concern in his eyes,
and the determination to make good his escape also.

As we lolled in apparent ease on the soft sod of the culture forest, the
traditional empty glass made its appearance in the circle. No one spoke
of it, but its significant reminder of death's clutch was a constant
thing in my mind. Never had fear and death been a part of my thought
before; but that empty goblet with its sweetly spiraling stem uppermost
was no longer just tradition, but now had a meaning almost immense. What
to do to avoid that damnable mechanical play of detrimental force from
the mind of some unknown rodite, staring through the viewplates of his
defective, detrimentally hypnotic mechanism, seeking to destroy the best
first? <span id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) If they thought we were
escaping they would seek us out and snatch us back.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

I sat and mused. "Simple magnetics; yet such mighty minds as the Atlans
fall before it. We must be clever . . ." I went on thinking of it; but
again recurred the regret of last night. If only the migration had taken
place a few years ago! But perhaps it had been so planned; and delayed?
Delayed by the black death which had thus far struck so secretly and
silently. The plan of the rodite must be near completion or their
secrecy would have been maintained.

And then, as I sat there, an idea presented itself. I knew a way to
escape, and I spoke quickly before my thoughts were clear enough for any
unseen listener to read

"Let us all charter a space ship and take a look at Mother Mu from
above! There is no greater thrill than that to cap the day!"

As one we leaped to our feet. I knew then that our thoughts had been
very similar; I had only been the first to express the next step in
spoken words.

"We will have to take a shuttle ship first," said a young Titan quickly.
"Come, I know the way."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_15"></span>[27:16](irl04.htm#fr_15.md) The Atlans, Mr. Shaver
reveals, were ever youthful, and never ceased growing. There was no such
thing as "maturity" in the sense that growth stopped. Thus, an Atlan's
age could be determined to a certain extent by his size. Many of them
reached tremendous stature, sometimes as much as 300 feet, and heights
of 40 feet and more were rather common. Mr. Shaver refers to "ancient"
books which have been destroyed, which contained a great deal of Atlan
knowledge and history, but points to references in the Bible such as "In
those days there were giants in the Earth" as <span id="page_28">p.
28</span> actual truth, recorded memory of the Titans. Especially
significant is the definite statement "in the Earth" and not on it! The
Atlans, by the use of their wonderful machines. kept their bodies
constantly supplied with a sufficient amount of exd (the energy ash from
which all matter is formed by condensation\] so that their growth never
stopped, but their bodies grew ever larger and heavier. Health itself
was determined by weight; a healthy person was heavy. If he became ill,
he lost weight. Illness is the inability of the body to fully utilize
the available exd, or is the result of an insufficient quantity of
exd.—Ed.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[31:17](irl04.htm#fr_16.md) Pressed for a more
complete explanation, Mr. Shaver has defined "dero' for us:

"Long ago it happened that certain (underground) cities were abandoned
and into those cities stole many mild mortals to live, At first they
were normal people, though on a lower intelligence plane; and ignorant
due to lack of proper education. It was inevitable that certain
inhabitants of the culture forests lose themselves and escape proper
development; and some of them are of faulty development. But due to
their improper handling of the life-force and ray apparatus in the
abandoned cities, these apparatii became harmful in effect. They simply
did not realize that the ray filters of the ray mechanisms must be
changed and much of the conductive metal renewed regularly. If such
renewals are not <span id="page_32">p. 32</span> made, the apparatus
collects in itself—in its metal—a disintegrant particle which gradually
turns its beneficial qualities into strangely harmful ones.

"These ignorant people learned to play with these things, but not to
renew them; so gradually they were mentally impregnated with the
persistently disintegrative particles. This habituates the creature's
mind, its mental movements, to being overwhelmed by detrimental, evil
force flows which in time produce a creature whose every reaction in
thought is dominated by a detrimental will. So it is that these wild
people, living in the same rooms with degenerating force generators, in
time become dero, which is short for detrimental energy robot.

"When this process has gone on long enough, a race of dero is produced
whose every thought movement is concluded with the decision to kill.
They will instantly kill or torture anyone whom they contact unless they
are extremely familiar with them and fear them. That is why they do not
instantly kill each other—because, being raised together, the part of
their brain that functions has learned very early to recognize as friend
or heartily to fear the members of their own group. They recognize no
other living thing as friend; to a dero all new things are enemy.

"To define: A dero is a man who responds mentally to dis impulse more
readily than to his own impulses. When a dero has used old. defective
apparatus full of dis particle accumulations, they become so degenerate
that they are able to think only when a machine is operating and they
are using it; otherwise they are idiot. When they reach this stage they
are known as 'ray' (A Lemurian word not to be confused with ray as it is
used in English.) Translated, ray means 'dangerous or detrimental energy
animal.' Ray is also used to mean a soldier—one of those who handles
beam weapons (note how the ancient meaning has come into our modern
word)."—Ed.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[35:18](irl04.htm#fr_17.md) Just as lightning
strikes the highest point, so does detrimental force seek the most
active and the healthiest fruit first—they are most attractive. The
detrimental is only a film over an integrative ion which is attracted
first to the most integrant bodies near. This holds true in thought
movements also—thus a dero strikes at the best first.—Ed.
