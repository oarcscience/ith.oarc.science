### CHAPTER VI

#### Conclave of the Elders

I never knew how much time the voyage consumed; but it seemed very soon
that the great vessel floated down the landing beam into the white and
yawning face of a landing area on a station satellite of Nor while I and
the other youths dreamed on almost oblivious in the quarters of Vanue.

Still in that dazed dream of love we followed among her maidens into the
tubes and aboard the special shuttle ship awaiting her, and shot off to
Nor looming not far away. We did not pause on Nor's dark surface, but
descended into the depths of a great cave toward the council place
somewhere in center Nor.

I had thought in the past that the Titans were mighty of thought and
size—but what I saw now eclipsed anything I had ever heard of the
glories of our own races. Big and vital as was Vanue, she was but a
little child among the tremendous Nortan Elders and Gods.

There are no words to describe what the development of unchecked growth
in man brings forth. These ancient Nor-tans, who had studied and
purified all the source-substances of growth and combined them into an
endless variety of nutrients which they introduced into their bodies by
many means—borne in electric flows; on penetrative sound waves; by
injections; by direct feeding—had been growing at a fierce rate for
unknown centuries. Their inner beings had evolved in various ways, so
that they were evidently of a more complex atomic and molecular
construction than ordinary flesh. There is no way to describe the
qualities of

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

thought, of inner strength of spirit seen on their faces and in the aura
that is always about such beings.

We trooped after Vanue as she entered the vast reaches of the council
cavern and took her throne by the side of her father, a mighty bulk of
man-flesh but only a lesser luminary in that gathering.

Before the council came to the business at hand we were treated to a
brief prelude of entertainment—psychologically a reward for the effort
of coming to the council. It vas a prelude to music and dancing, a
review of the best talent of the planet, calculated to bring the minds
of the council into harmony on the subject of the welfare and glory of
the race. Entertainment, yes; but the amusements of Elder Gods are
nothing to pass over.

What it all meant was beyond me; I was aware only of the awful beauty
and tremendously fecund strength of the dancers—bred and fed by wizard
technicons of growth; trained to express meaning and emotion of a kind
too vast for ro to grasp. They danced in a vortex of conductive rays
which carried their thought and body essence, augmented by apparatus, to
each watcher.

The climax was the appearance of the greatest beauty of the planet—a
sorceress of the art of entertainment named Hypaytee—who wore on her
head a device which caused a vast augmentation of the thought images of
her mind to play about her body in a tremendous revealment of the
infinitely developed soul of woman. I had loved woman—hut never before
had I undestood even vaguely what development did to the greatest value
of life. The rewards this woman could give a man by the use of her mind
alone, coupled as it was to that mighty, sinuous dancer's body
expressing all the things that draw men to women, brought the concourse
of Elders to their feet in an earth-shaking applause and a mighty vow to
care for the race that produced her. This thought was also projected
from the control rays which took root in every heart. It came to me,

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

too: and I was a Nor-man now, no matter what I had been before!

Then Vanue's thought flashed out, setting the thought cloud <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) areas into coruscation with an alarm, a
command to attention. I was brought out of my daze to see my own thought
record projected in the thought clouds. I saw once again, as real as the
first time I had seen it, the fear on the faces of the six-armed Sybyl
of the Info screens; the striking of the black death at the dance; the
hideous fear on the faces of the dancers; Arl's sweet face contorted in
a scream.

A thought-record from the brain of each of our group from Tean City
followed. It was evidence enough, thus gathered together, that evil had
the upper hand in Mu.

My own efforts to conceal my thought as I planned our escape and the
trick of the belts on the throttle that had resulted in our success
finished the record display.

I was mightily surprised to hear applause and a great thunder of voices
calling for me—Mutan Mion of Atlan. They called for me, the stupid
artist! those vast voices from hundreds of ancient beings, some of them
three hundred feet in height!

Vanue held me out in her two hands for all to see. And as I became the
center of their attention, my embarrassment exceeded any emotion of a
similar nature I had ever had. If I had known that they would think of
an escape from such a condition as so much of a feat it is probable I
would never have tried it. I would have been hopeless of success frôm
the very inception of the fool-hardy thought.

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

I was put down again, my face red, my thoughts flustered, my
embarrassment a flood of discomfort in me—but a discomfort that held
within it a strange glow of humility that was at the same time a glow of
pride. I was proud with a just pride; and I felt somehow that it was not
my own pride, but the pride of Vanue, whose utter slave I had become.
Vanue, Elder of Van of Nor, was proud of her ro!

The actual conference of the Godheads took place now in thought
projections in the thought-cloud area. I saw that any thought, no matter
how abstract, could be projected in these clouds by thought
augmentors. <span id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) They used an image
language instead of words, and their talk was to me but a whirlwind of
changing forms, faces, geometrical figures, maps of space and figures on
orbits and many

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

other things incomprehensible to me and probably to most of the ro
present. The powerful minds of the Nortans functioned too rapidly for us
to grasp any but the simplest meaning in the ideographs unfolding in the
cloud before us. But I did gather that some action was to take place at
once to save the Atlans and the Titans of Atlan from the derodite.

Now from the mists of the Elder Gods’ highest throne of all came a swift
ray that lanced down and touched me delicately. An ecstasy of change
came over me. What that ray did to me and told me in the next brief
instant I can never say in any words. Then a voice spoke out:

"Muton Mion of Mu, we have seen the great compassion and love for your
fellow man that lives in your breast. We admire such greatness in such a
tiny ro; and because of the love of man in you we have decided that it
must not go without full satisfaction in deed.

"You came here to gather together an expedition and return to Mu for the
rescue of your comrades who are in deadly danger. Never could you carry
such a gigantic project as this would require to its successful
completion—and yet you have done it; for we of Nor have made a solemn
vow to rescue the men of Atlan on Mu and to destroy the derodite who
threaten to spread their evil even into dark space.

"However, because of your great desire, we have planned a place for you
in this great mission. You shall have your part in it; and you shall
have another duty which is worthy of your capacity for compassion. We,
the Nortans, have seen in your mind a vision of the far future—of a time
on Mu when men shall be slaves of the degenerate sun around which it
circles; of a time when they will be but mentally deficient savages
living out a life span compressed to an irreducible minimum by
radioactives. This may be a true vision, in part or in whole—for we may
not succeed entirely in our mission. We may even fail!

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

"Therefore, we give to you the task of preparing a message, in great
duplication, to these pitiful men of the future—so that there may be
some hope that those among them who have the mental power to fight
against their cruel environment may make their lives in some measure
complete. This message will be left on Mu, and in it, in many places for
future man to find."

The voice ceased. The conference was over.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_25"></span>[61:26](irl07.htm#fr_25.md) Three dimensional
pictures were formed by projection of the image into a mass of gases
held by electric pressure in a cloud whose particles glowed in various
colors according to the mental wavelength of the vibration field in
which they floated. Ordinarily the cloud is opaque white, and when the
thought-picture is projected into it by the Nortan mind, it becomes
transparent except for the particles which form the image in full color.
The command for attention causes the whole cloud to change color from
milky white to flaming red.—Ed.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[62:27](irl07.htm#fr_26.md) In a letter from Mr.
Shaver, this reference to augmentors is explained in great detail. Says
Mr. Shaver: “I refer you to a picture printed in many high school books
of ancient history. It is from the ‘Book of the Dead’ a copy of which
could be obtained in any large library from a book about the ‘Book of
the Dead.’ This picture shows a scene which is called a picture of the
Gods, and is in two sections. On the lower section the Gods are
‘weighing the souls’ our historians tell us. Actually it looks like a
butcher buying a hybrid hog: half hog and half deer . . . the animal has
a line around its middle as though it had been cut apart and sewn
together again. It is evidence of the hybrid breeding of animals by the
Atlans and Titans of Mu.

“Another picture shows a teacher seated before an instrument, and before
the teacher, facing him, is a group of students each holding a smaller
instrument. This is an actual pictographic representation of the thought
augmentor and the focusing device used to pick up its waves.

“Still another instrument pictured in ancient Egyptian glyphs is the
crook the Pharoahs always carry. Notice the bottom end has a clevis—with
holes. I have seen such handles protruding from the ancient weapon-beam
apparatus. It acts as a beam director, like the stick of an airplane;
and if removed would have kept the apparatus from being used by anyone
else. Why else the clevis on the bottom? The origin of scepters was this
carrying of the control handle to keep others from using the dangerous
apparatus while one was gone for a short time.

“Certainly the use of this apparatus was very general in ancient times
among rulers for it gave them control of men’s minds and its use was
always secret among them.”—Ed.
