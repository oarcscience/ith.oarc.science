### CHAPTER VIII

#### Under The Pain Ray

"Oooooh, Mi . . . Mion . . ."

Hearing these moans and my name through a fuzzy humming in my ears, I
tried to open my eyes and raise myself up. I couldn't. Then, gradually,
with the return of consciousness, I realized that I was aching to the
ends of my feet. I opened my eyes.

Above my head was the cause of that aching I felt. Now that I was awake
and conscious, it wasn't just an ache, it was pain. There above my head
was a slowly swinging pendulum, the end of which held a vari-pain ray
lens and it was this sweeping motion of the ray that made me feel pain
all over my body. I couldn't move from under it. I tried, but the crew
of the Satana had too much practice with binding captives in chains for
me to do more than tighten a few of the more uncomfortable ones around
my wrist and ankles. I could move my head, and turning around I saw
whence came the moans and my name. The brave Aesir were chained down
alongside me. That was fiendish—chaining Earthmen in range of a pain ray
that was nearly killing a fifty foot immortal member of the Elder
Races <span id="fr_56"></span>[20](#fn_56.md).

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

They were moaning softly and I felt the tears come to my eyes with pride
in these men that old Mother Mu could still produce. Men suffering
agonizing torture and just barely moaning—the same as a young boy of,
say, ten years being tortured on a crude Jotun rack without making a
sound. They must be near crazy with the torment. I was myself. Sathanas,
it seemed, did not intend to have his guests miss any of the dubious
comforts that he could provide.

I figured that we must be some place in the lower hold of the Satana—no
ports were visible, just the blank dull metal walls. There was something
missing, though I couldn't decide exactly what.

ARL!

"Arl! Arl . . . where are you?" I called, thinking that perhaps she
might be in the same cell as we, but placed so that I couldn't see her.
That hope was destroyed when Tyr, sobbing with the pain he was
suffering, said, "My Lord . . . ugh . . . they didn't bring her with us
. . ."

"Tyr, what did they do with her?" My concern for Arl made me forget for
a moment the awful torment, the horrible spasms of pain that dropped
like blood from our bodies.

. . . I don't know . . . Lord Mion! Are we dying? This . . . pain . . .
I can't stand it!"

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

"Easy, friend Tyr," I tried to comfort him, "they will not keep this up
until we die . . . they're too cruel for even that. This is just a
sample of what we are in for. Courage, friends."

My beloved Arl . . what had these accursed fiends done to her? How long
had I lain in this cell unconscious? Sathanas had admitted some of the
foul things he planned for my wife. Had he had time to carry out some of
them?

I strained at the chains; I had to get free. I failed. And these poor
Aesir warriors were near death with pain. Something had to be done. But
what?

I had it. Hypnosis!

These men were of a lower mental calibre than myself, understandable
when you realized that I had twenty centuries to develop while they had
barely that many years. Hypnosis would serve two purposes—take their
minds off the pain they were enduring and fill them with subconscious
information that we might be able to use if the scales of Fortune fell
in our direction.

I commenced to talk to them, soothing their pain as much as I could with
my voice. It wasn't long until they were in that stage half way between
total hypnosis and consciousness. That was the best I could do,
considering that we were operating under extreme difficulties, being
bound and continually swept with the vari-pain beam. From talking about
them and their families to fix their interest, I had gradually worked
the talk around to technical subjects. I wanted to teach them as much of
spacemanship as I could under the circumstances.

"At the mid-space-point between two attracting spatial bodies," I
explained, beginning with the most elementary principles of interstellar
astrogation, "lies a thin 'zone of neutralization'—a thin zone where all
matter is weightless."

"We have heard you mention that before, Lord Mion," spoke one of the
Aesir from his bed of artificial pain.

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

"Well, friends, that 'zone of neutralization' is important. It is the
knowledge and the use of the peculiarities of the way all mass is
inertially neutralized there that enables us to journey between the
farthest stars."

"Why is that, Mion?"

"Because, starting a star trip anywhere else would be impossible. There
would be too much mass to overcome. It would be impossible to achieve
the needed acceleration quick enough."

The Aesir were doing their best to follow what I was telling them—but
now they could only groan.

"It's like . . . like . . . the difference between jumping off the top
branch of a bushy tree and jumping off a wall. In the one, drag at the
start slows you down somewhat, whereas, in going off the wall, there is
nothing to slow your acceleration. Do you see, friends?"

"Aye, Lord, we hear . ." They struggled to suppress the shrieks that
hammered at their lips for voice.

"Now, Warriors, listen carefully. It is there, in the 'zone of complete
lack of weight' that all long, interstellar flights MUST begin . . .
always remember to be very careful in pointing your ship on the exact
course to your distant objective lest your course intersects another
path where some object may lie that would destroy you in the event of a
collision."

When they had indicated that they understood that, I continued.

"Poised motionless in the exact center of the 'zone,' and pointing in
the correct direction, the ship is given full power of all the
plates <span id="fr_57"></span>[21](#fn_57.md) at once. Ordinarily, such
instant application

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

of all the power at rest would kill all the ship's passengers, but at
the EXACT center of the 'zone' ANY acceleration can be achieved without
danger, depending upon the amount of power impetus."

Again they groaned acceptance of what I had said.

"When you give your ship full throttle as I've told you, it will
instantly attain vast velocity depending on the power of your ship's
plates and how carefully you balanced your ship in the center of the
'zone'. Keep applying power, and in a short time you will find yourself
far beyond your starting point. Like a flash you will be in the region
of the stars which are unfamiliar to you, traveling at a speed your
Earth brains cannot comprehend. If you were watching a spacer accelerate
from the 'zone', it would seem to you that the ship had vanished. No
motion would be seen. It would be there one moment and disappear the
next—disappear into nothingness. Such is the speed of ships that fly
between the stars. Using this tremendous speed, you can fling yourself
far beyond the light of this deadly, evil Sun and within the regions of
space that the Elder Races, the Gods of the Aesir, have chosen as their
dwelling place."

"Would not we humans be in danger from the wrath of our Gods for daring
to come to them, Lord Mion?"

"No, my friends, once in the general area of the dark planets, you would
soon be overtaken by some space patrol and, your intentions being
understood, you would be helped in every way to find yourselves a home
far from the deadly 'de', a home near those of the Gods. Have you
understood?

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

All four of the Aesir groaned their answer: "Aye, Lord Mion, we have
understood . . . you . . . and will do as . . . you advise . . . if . .
. there ever comes . . . the time when we are . . . free of the clutches
of this Sathanas."

There were other things I explained to the Aesir, things like how the
first light speed is achieved with a light impetus but as the
interstellar space ships move into as much as fifty-speeds, the 'ether
drag' increases on the order of one unit of drag to fifty units of light
speed.

Thus, the required impetus needed to achieve one light speed is
increased by one for each additional fifty light speeds. Actually, no
body in the known cosmos is ever entirely weightless, but there are
conditions where a given mass or body loses apparent weight to the point
where its weight is negligible. The best place to achieve this condition
of weightlessness is that area that I've told you about . . . the area
between the world or other spatial bodies that we term the "zone of
weightlessness."

I went on and on with my talking and explaining, more to keep from
thinking than from any hope of teaching these long suffering friends
over-much. The pain, or rather, the perception of the pain, had
gradually increased almost to the point of madness for the victim. No
doubt the fiends that served Sathanas were making a thought record of
all our sensations and words as the master of this depraved vessel had
promised to send to my friends in the Nor Patrol.

"Course must be plotted and ship poised exactly in the center of the
zone . . ."

". . . hit such zones every time you pass between worlds . . . maintain
acceleration . . ."

The pain never stopped . . . on and on . . . pain . . .

waves of agony . . . some smooth strokes of torment . . .

"Use the devices that the builders have installed to determine the
center . . . full throttle . . . trust instruments . . ."

Flashes of memory came and went in the delirium of

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

our fevered agony . . . what I said . . . gone . . .

The young Aesir had good minds though very little real education. I
could not have taught them any mathematics, even had my hands been free
to do so. It would be fortunate, indeed, if they remembered any of the
facts of space navigation that I was trying to get across to them. I,
myself, am not certain of all that I told them. The longer we were
chained under the vari-pain ray, the more our minds slipped from our
conscious control. A living body can stand only so much of nerve
vibration.

This torment had been going on for hours . . . painful . . . moments of
release when it reached the ends of its swings and then that laving with
agony again.

It may have been days . . . or weeks . . . I don't know . . . just back
and forth . . . pain.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_56"></span>[168:20](irl20.htm#fr_56.md) SIZE OF THE ELDER
RACE: The authors suggest that anyone interested get a copy of Charles
Fort's "Lo!" In Chapter Nine. he .discusses the findings, BY PRESENT DAY
HUMANS, of the skeletons of huge creatures 40 to 65 feet in length. The
conventional "scientific" explanation is that they are the skeletal
remains of whales washed up on the shore. Fort refutes this sort of
<span id="page_169">p. 169</span> illogic by pointing out that whales’
skeletons do not have BROAD HIP BONES.

He also mentions a report from the LONDON DAILY NEWS. In it is recounted
the dredging up of a large skull from the north of Scotland, of a size
that the authorities claimed would fit an elephant, but it would have to
have been a large one to boast eye-sockets a foot across. We suggest,
for those interested in such research, that it MIGHT have been the
skull, preserved somehow (or, perhaps, fairly recently dispatched), but
a skull, nevertheless, of one of the ancient Giants that built the caves
beneath our world. (Excerpt is from the Daily News, June 6, 1908.)

If the eyes are a gauge of the full size of the completed skeleton, the
creature (a member of the Elder Race?) would have to have been at least
40 feet tall.—Author.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[171:21](irl20.htm#fr_57.md) DRIVER PLATES: In the
two thousand years since Mutan's visit to Earth, the ships used by him
have developed and adopted the drive plate instead of the gas jet drive.
Both are rocket drives in principle, but different in detail. The drive
is an alloy metal that decomposes into a repellant electric flow very
much like gravity in reverse. Things fall away from the plate when
certain frequencies of dis-electric are applied to the plate. The
resultant impulse <span id="page_172">p. 172</span> is rendered useful
by a reflecting material, opaque to the drive flow, on the side of the
plate nearest the ship. Hence all the repellant flow is directed
backward—giving a drive like a rocket in principle but very different in
detail. This is the drive generally used in the ancient ships—though
there are several distinct types of drives—and ships from widely
separated civilizations lying about the caverns, still today existant,
and in some cases still usable.—Author.
