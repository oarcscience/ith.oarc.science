#### CHAPTER VII

### A Wedding on Nor

As we passed from the misty vastness of the council cavern Vanue turned
to us of Atlan, trooping behind her, and said in a serious voice.

"It is law among Nortans that no service to the race goes unrewarded.
Now there are certain things I plan for you which I cannot give you
legally except you swear to serve me always as my loyal followers. Is
there anything to keep you from that?" Her eyes searched us one by one.

The Mars maid answered, her eyes shining:

"There is only our oath to the state of Atlan, and the present evil
conditions render that oath void."

Vanue went on: "I am only a young Elder; you might do better than to
follow me—my fortune in the future is not wholly assured. You might do
better!"

"You have honored us, Vanue," said the Mars maid. "You have let us see
your mind at work; we know there is no evil in you. That your fortune
should be our fortune is enough for me. You have said you will give the
love of our men back to us, and though I don't understand how you will
or can, I know you will."

One by one we swore loyalty to Vanue before all other greater beings.

Then Vanue looked at her Nor maids and said with a strange innuendo that
made them laugh with delight and anticipation: "Now we must send them to
school—in pairs!" The laughter of the gold-topped lilies of Nor rang
merrily.

What sort of a school was this, I wondered, to make them laugh so?

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

The tubes took Vanue's train to the doors of her own cavern palace. Huge
air locks swung open to admit the whole procession into the under parts
of the palace. When we stepped out into the special air of her home that
tremendous acceleration of the life processes that I had noted in her
chambers in the space liner again seized us—and life became a thing to
really fear to lose.

But as yet I had no inkling of what lay before me in the mystery of the
wisdom that had built that place to house their first borne, Elder
Princess Vanue, daughter of the Elder Gods of Nor.

Flinging off her wraps, which she had worn to the council chamber
because of their significance, Vanue said: "We will put the children in
school, and then to our own work. We have much to do to make ready and
the time is short."

"School" turned out to be a vast laboratory—a replica on a much mightier
scale of our own Titan technicon's laboratory school where Arl and I had
learned to know each other and the possibilities of life. Instead of
embryos, the nutrient tanks contained six foot ro and even much larger
men and women.

Taking Arl and me in her hands she placed us in one of the big tanks.
The liquids were warm and comforting and we splashed about playfully
while others of our Atlan group were also being placed in pairs in tanks
like our own.

Then Vanue's maids swarmed about us, placing wires about our arms, our
wrists, our hands and feet; fastening breathing cups over our mouths;
thrusting needles into our veins and attaching them to the ends of thin
tubes; placing caps of metal with many wires connected to generators and
other machines on our heads; covering our eyes with strangely wired
plates of crystal.

I heard the tank cover sealed and more fluid gushed in until we were
completely submerged. We floated in suspension within the tanks.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

Then began a strange thing; for our minds, Arl's and mine, were
conscious of each other through the medium of the interrelated wiring
and the plates over our eyes—an awareness that must have been augmented
a thousand times. Her breath was my breath, her thoughts took place in
my head stronger than Vanue's ever had, and the woman-soul of her was so
augmented in my mind as to eclipse all other woman's appeal that my
memory had ever recorded.

A strange little voice (it must have been Vanue's speaking over a
telethought instrument) whispered beside me: "You will never escape Arl
now. You are her slave forever." And as I listened, I knew that Vanue
spoke the truth.

Arl's face, laughing before me in the eye plates, became larger and
larger, entered my brain, became the wellspring of my being. I heard
Arl's thought, a vast river of force flowing in my mind, saying: "Where
I go, there will you go also. The thing that is my desire is growing in
you. My roots are your soul. You are my desire and the slave of my
desire!"

And I heard my own thought make answer in Arl's mind: "So it shall be,
always, oh maiden of the clicking hooves and swift hands, of the
beautiful tail, of the clean will and strong desire!" And I knew that
what I said was true.

The fluids and forces that were pulsing through us made these things
grow within our beings, so that centuries of loving contact were
replaced by minutes of furious growth; and we fell asleep, strangely
within each other our thoughts, growing and becoming an integrant part
of our being. Through every fibre of my body I could feel fecund growth
swelling and expanding, patterned by thoughts which were mine and yet
not mine. In my ears strange sounds beat mysterious meanings which were
forces taking root within me. My memory was a vast garden of new
thoughts growing as my mind grew, and remembering all

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

the principles that came over the wires from the Elder Gods' own thought
record.

Always overhead I could feel the Nor maids watching my mind pictures and
correcting the growth memory so that everything took its rightful place.
And within me I could hear Arl, sleeping and growing too, and she was
very dear.

The thing that was me slept as a babe sleeps in the womb, and the seeds
of the Gods' thoughts took root in Arl and me and grew. We were at once
children asleep in the womb of the God mother, and man and wife wrapped
in each other's adoring arms. Time flowed by like water; and we slept
but were more awake and alive than ever before, and felt the pleasure of
each the other's body and soul appeal, the very inner essence of
man-life and woman-appeal to man. Life pulsed from each of us into the
other constantly. We had more pleasure of each other in the growth
school tank than ever I have known of in any pleasure.

Among the things that became a part of my knowledge was the promise of
the future in such tanks as this: Sometime Arl and I were to build such
a tank and appartatus and take a long sleep in it and awake as Gods,
full of the strength and the beauty and the pleasure of life and life's
fulfilment.

So it was that Arl and I were married by an actual mingling of the seeds
of our being, and not by any foolish ceremony; blessed by the actual
love of Vanue, now our Lady, and not by any meaningless words.

Though we were in the growth tank less than a week, we came out inches
bigger in every way; but the real growth that had taken place was an
inner growth—for I was vastly heavier and my strength was aware of new
limits.

Mentally, too, I was vastly more able; for when I looked about at the
apparatus I knew the inner construction and

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

use of every bit of it, and I knew that from then on few things would
mystify me other than the work of the very oldest Gods.

I found that I had not lost my love for Vanue, but that I loved her now
as one loves and is grateful to a leader. My love for Arl was the
strongest thing in me. <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md)

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

All of us found out now that Vanue was not the most foolish of the
Elders of Nor, despite her comparative youth, but was looked up to
everywhere as one whose star was in the ascendant. Her followers were
more numerous than many much more prominent Elders.

Arl and I spent several days together in our love, and in seeing the
wonders of Nor's civilization. Here was a vast series of underground
cities, all heated and bathed in beneficial energies artifically
created. No need for a sun's light to live. No danger of
dis-integratives from a dangerous sun poisoning the soil and water of
the planet, to cause slow death by age.

Then one day Vanue called me to her.

"I speak now of the mission the Elders of the council granted to you in
the conference chamber. As you remember, your part in the coming task is
two-fold. In one phase of this you will accompany us to act with us in
the great war that must be fought. We have developed a plan in which
your help as an advance and secret agent is

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

necessary. You will be told more about that later, when we have
embarked.

"Now, however, your other mission begins, here on Nor. It is the mission
of love for your fellow men. No matter how successful we are in rescuing
the men of Atlan, it cannot be that we will rescue all of them. Many
must not be rescued! There is nothing we could do for them, poisoned as
they are to the point of death. Nor must we allow any of this poison to
escape to the dark worlds where it can infect others. Too, the dero
influence is dangerous, and madness must not spread over the universe.

"Thus it has been given to you to inscribe on imperishable plates of
telonion, our eternal metal, a message to future man which will be
placed on and in Mu so that those who have the intelligence to find and
read it may benefit by the truths of growth and defense against a
too-soon death by age.

"After the passing of Atlan science from Mu, men will begin to die at
the same age, and their sons will all be the same size at the same age.
This will be caused by accumulations of sun-poison in the water of Mu,
which will stop all growth in mankind at almost the very beginning of
their development. They will scarcely get beyond childhood before they
will begin to die.

"These plates you will inscribe will contain a message that is a key and
a path to the door that will open life value to these future men, whose
fate we know and pity, but cannot prevent. We can only teach them what
we know that will enable them to get the most out of their life on Mu.
The dero will not be able to read, and thus will die as they should.
Those whose minds are powerful enough to escape complete dero-robotism
will read and profit.

"You can tell them how to attain this life growth by freeing their food
and water intake of all the poisons that will be found in it in the
natural state. The age poisons can be removed by centrifuge and by
still; their air can be

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

made a nutrient by proper treatment and freed of all its detrimental
ions by field sweeps of electric. The exd on which the basic integration
of life feeds can be concentrated (just as it was in your body in the
growth school tank) in energy flows which greatly increase the rate of
growth and the solidity and weight of the flesh.

"Tell future man to do these things, Mutan Mion, and their reward will
be great. You have seen what the reward of such effort can be—in
thousands of years of life's fullness—even on a planet under a
detrimental sun. We cannot save those men yet unborn. We can only leave
for them the heritage that is rightfully theirs, the heritage of our
sciencon knowledge. And you, Mutan, in your infinite love and pity for
your fellow men, shall perform this task with all the energy that your
love makes possible!"

I left the presence of mighty Vanue, marveling at the understanding of
the Elders and Gods of Nor. No wonder that their race is so great. To
me, the humble artist of Sub Atlan, had been given a great mission; one
that thrilled me to my depths. I hurried to Arl to tell her all about
it.

"The wonder of it!" I exclaimed, having repeated what Vanue had told me,
"In my hands—the simple-awkward, unskilled artist's hands of Mutan Mion,
culture man of Mu—has been placed the hope of future man! To me is given
the honor to preserve for men yet unborn the knowledge of their heritage
of life!

Arl held me to her, and her eyes were shining. "Yes, I understand," she
said.

"There is more!" I went on. "The Nortans set out soon to rescue many
thousands of Atlans and Titans and their variform offspring from the
threat of death by a dying sun's radioactives, and from the black death
of the derodite; but I, Mutan Mion, am to be the rescuer of untold
numbers of future men down through the history of Mu, until the very
planet is dead! Think of it . . ."

Arl kissed me tenderly. "Go, Mutan, and busy yourself

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

with the beginning of the message. You have but little time, and I think
you should begin by putting down the story of Mu—our story!—and thus
give body to the message to future man. Perhaps he will not even
remember Atlantis! Nor Tean City, nor all the other vast cities of
center Mu. Perhaps he will not even remember that there ever was such a
being as an Atlan or a Titan or a Nortan. It will be your duty to tell
him that, too, my loved one. For how can he believe and hope if he has
no knowledge of the truth of life?"

"Most certainly must I tell them of you!" I exclaimed. "Never in all
Time was there such a woman!"

And kissing her again, I hurried off to the sciencon laboratories to
gather the materials necessary to begin scribing my imperishable plates
of telonium with the message of hope to Lemurians unborn.

For many days I worked, putting down the truths and the knowledge to
overcome the poison of age to the fullest possible extent, as it is now
done in Tean City and all Mu; and the means to full life growth. I told
the story of our flight from Mu, and much of the history of Mu. I told
of the Titans and the Atlans who live throughout all dark space; who are
seaching ever for new suns. I told of the Nortans; who do not believe in
living near any sun, old or new.

I brought my message up to date—and barely in time. For when I had
finished Arl came to me.

"Vanue's ship leaves for Mu in a few hours," she said. "You must be
ready."

At that moment it hit me—these were my last hours with my loved Arl
until I returned from the war in Mu; if ever I returned. Now for the
first time since reaching Nor I knew sorrow. But Arl saw what was in my
mind, and her words brought joy back to me.

"I am to go along, as operator of one of the telescreens on our own
ship," she announced happily.

I should have known that my loyal Arl would never

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

consent to remaining behind while I went into danger!

"Your life is my life," she was whispering as she snuggled in my arms.
"Where you go, there also will I go. Your soul's nearness is my desire."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_27"></span>[69:28](irl08.htm#fr_27.md) The "school" of growth
to which Mutan Mion and Arl and their companions went for their growth
in both body and mind is the concrete manifestation in apparatus of the
science of mangrowth as conceived by the three ancient god-races. It was
based on simple laws of the integration of matter. These simple laws are
being set forth in a scientific monograph by Mr. Shaver and your editor,
who firmly believe that its publication will throw a bombshell into all
of present-day physics and chemistry. Naturally they cannot be dealt
with in complete form here, but a slight explanation of what was done to
Mutan Mion seems necessary. Part of this explanation is in the words of
Mr. Shaver:

Growth is an inflow of exd. Life itself is a flame of integration, which
like a fire must be fed or it goes out. Exd is the fuel of that flame,
and by its condensation into matter, adds to the flame, causing growth.
Naturally this growth is a material growth. What the Nortans did was to
concentrate the flow of exd so as to feed the flame of life at a greater
rate, and thus cause greater growth. A technical simile might be drawn:
a fire, when supplied with finely divided carbon and a larger supply of
oxygen becomes a greater, fiercer thing. It is the same with life. When
supplied with a greater quantity of exd, it grows, becomes stronger,
more active.

The mechanical means is very similar to the magnetic field lenses used
in electron microscopes, which direct and focus a flow of particles
called electrons into a beam more revealing than light because its
particles are smaller. This same magnetic field principle can be used to
focus exd and thus hasten integration. A magnetic field, lens-shaped,
could focus falling exd by attunement just as a radio collects certain
waves. This attunement can be determined by constructing a coil in the
same shape as the coils of the electron microscope—but much larger. The
focus can be determined by its light focus, which would be the same. A
plant, placed beneath this point of focus, perks up its leaves, reaches
out, is invigorated, exudes a dew, in a short time is twice the size it
would ordinarily have been.

Once there was a book called the "T" book ('T' for integration, for
growth force, energy, etc.) which was in rather widespread use up to the
time of Christ. It contained the elemental frames of logic and simple
what-to-dos like the age-poison elimination. beneficial generators, and
so on. But some group feared its influence and it was destroyed, so
completely that only the memory of that once infallible book remains,
which memory was the father of <span id="page_70">p. 70</span> the Bible
and all its veneration, including the cross on its cover, the 'T' sign.

The direct need for a greater future for man is strengthening of the
general mind by T forces, the growth of a better brain. No progress is
truly progress unless man grows a better brain to grow a better brain.
That is the pattern of progress—to grow a growth to grow, etc. What man
needs is a conscious aim toward growth. To learn how to grow into a man
better able to grow into a wiser man is a goal followed by but a few men
out of all the number who could be striving in that direction. The great
ones called such a goal 'TIC' and any energy not directed toward that
goal was called 'ERR.' Alexis Carrel says much the same thing in 'Man,
the Unknown.' He is one of the few men on earth whose efforts are not
err to self interest. That is, he aims to understand his life process
and make it last longer. True self interest is seen in his efforts, as
in few others. These others think of self interest as an oppositional of
other self interests—which is a de illusion (Atlan for disillusion), for
oppositionals neutralize. True self interest would therefore always be a
coincident, not an oppositional.

Our most basic concepts have become err from disintegrant force
distortion of thought flows over the long period of time since we were
children of the Gods of the past.—Ed.
