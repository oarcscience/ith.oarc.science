### CHAPTER I

#### City of the Titans

I was working in the studio of Artan Gro when I heard a great laugh
behind me. If ever there was derision in a laugh, there was derision in
this one. I flung down my gaudy brushes and my palette and turned about
in a rage—to find the master himself, his red cave of a mouth wide open
in his black beard. I cooled my temper with an effort; for great indeed
is Artan Gro, master artist of Sub Atlan.

"I am sorry, Mutan Mion," he gasped, "but I can't control my laughter.
No one ever has conceived, much less executed, anything worse than what
you have put upon canvas! What do you call it, 'Proteus in a Convulsive
Nightmare'?"

But Artan Gro could control himself, I was sure. It is one of the things
I have learned of the really great in the arts; they make no pretenses.
He was laughing because he wanted to tell me frankly what he thought of
my ability as an artist. It is bad enough when your friends mock your
work (and they had), but when the master is convulsed with laughter it
is high time to wake up to the truth.

"It is true, great Artan Gro," I said humbly. "I want to paint but I
cannot. I haven't the ability."

Artan Gro's expression softened. He smiled, and as he smiled it was as
though he had turned on the sunlight.

"Go," he said, "go; to the deeper caverns at Mu's center. Once there
study science; learn to mix the potions

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

that give the brain greater awareness, a better rate of growth." He
patted my shoulder and added a last bit of advice. "Once you have mixed
the potions, take them. Drink them—and grow!" He passed on, still
chuckling.

Why is the truth always so brutal? Or does it just seem brutal when it
comes from those wiser than you? I slunk from the studio; but I had
already determined to take his advice. I would go to Tean City, at Mu's
center. I would go to the science schools of the Titans.

Never before had I considered leaving Sub Atlan, my birthplace, or as I
should express it, my growth place, for I am a culture man, a product of
the laboratories. In fact, I remember no other place on Mu, although it
is a fact that during the process of my development to culture manhood,

I roamed the culture forests of Atlantis, <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) which is the name for Surface Atlan. Sub
Atlan is just below Atlantis, while Tean City is located at the center
of Mu, at a great depth below Sub Atlan. The walls of the great cavern
in which Tean City is located are hardened to untellable strength by
treatment with ray-flows which feed its growth until it is of great
density. There are many other cities which grew

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

through the centuries to vast size, but none so great as Tean City. Some
are abandoned, but all are indestructible; their cavern walls too dense
to penetrate or to collapse.

Since Tean City is located near the center of Mother Mu, gravity
neutralizes itself by opposition. It is very comfortable. Many of the
Titans live there, and in fact, it is almost a Titan city. There also
are the mighty ones, the Elders of the Atlan race's government. Huge
they are, like great trees, many centuries old and still growing. I had
long wished to see them, and now that I had decided to go, the thrill
was greater than any I had ever experienced, I was going down into the
city of many wonders!

Out on the street I took one of the many vehicles that are provided for
travel about the city. These vehicles, their weight reduced by a gravity
deflection device, are powered by motors whose energy is derived from a
gravity focusing magnetic field, by which one side of a flywheel becomes
much heavier than the other. This is accomplished by bending gravity
fall <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) in the same way that a lens bends
a light ray.

The topless <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) buildings of Sub Atlan
fled by me; and soon I neared the squat entrance to the shafts that fell

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

from Sub Atlan to Center Mu, to Tean City, home of the Titans. <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) I knew that swift elevators dropped down
these shafts; but I had never traveled in one of them.

Because I knew the control-man of one of the elevators, having talked
with him often of Tean City and the wonders he had seen in it, I went to
his shaft for my descent. He was glad to see me, and very much surprised
to learn that I was going to Tean City.

"You will never regret it!" he declared.

The car dropped sickeningly, so swiftly that a great fear grew in me
that I would be crushed by deceleration when we finally stopped. In
panic I watched an indicator's two hands move slowly toward each other
as though to cover its face in shame. Then, with little sensation, the

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

car stopped. Here at the center of Mu I had become nearly weightless and
the ceasing of even such swift motion did not have ill effects upon my
weightless body. I knew that I would not have that fear again.

Two fat Atlans stepped out of the car ahead of me, sighing with relief
at their renewed weightlessness, which they had obviously been
anticipating. As I was about to follow them from the car, the
control-man drew me aside.

"Fear rides the ways down here," he whispered, his sharp-pointed,
cat-like ears quivering an alert. "Fear is a smell down here that is
ever in the nose—a bad smell, too. Try to figure it out while you are
down here; and tell me, too, if you get an answer."

I did not understand what he meant, but I promised anyway. The smell of
fear, in Tean City?

Immediately I was immersed in the sensually shocking appeal of a
variform crowd, mostly at this hour, a shopping rush of female
variforms. While there were many of my own type, and of the elevator
control-man's type, there were a greater number of creatures of every
shape the mind could grasp and some that it could not. All were
citizens; all were animate and intelligent—hybrids of every race that
space crossing had ever brought into contact, from planets whose very
names are now lost in time. The technicons may have been wrong in the
opinion of some when they developed variform breeding; but they have
certainly given life variety. I had never seen so many variforms <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) before.

At a corner of the vastly vaulted way where many

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

rollat platforms <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) crossed and recrossed
each other, I stepped to a telescreen and dialed the student center. The
image of a tremendous six-armed Sybyl female filled the screen and the
electrically augmented body appeal of the mighty life within her seized
the youth in me and wrung it as no embrace from lesser female ever had.

"And what" her voice shook me as a leaf in an organ pipe "might a pale
and puny male like you want in Tean City? You look as if you never had
enough to eat, as if love had passed you by. Did you come down here
because no one wanted you elsewhere?"

I grinned self-consciously back at her image, my voice a feeble piping
in comparison to hers.

"I have come to learn something beside drawing lines around dreams. I am
a painter from the subsurface who has decided that knowledge of actual
growth is more important than the false growth of an untrue image upon a
canvas." I wondered what the master would have said to hear me.

"You are right," she boomed back, her six arms engaged in complex wand
mysterious movements, picking up and laying down instruments and tools
in bewildering rapidity, her attention elsewhere yet enough remaining on
me to hold me bound in an attraction as strong as a towing cable. She
was a forty foot Titan, her age unknowable. As I thought upon this and
tried not to think of the immense beauty and life force of her, I
suddenly realized she was hiding fear. I have a peculiar faculty for
sensing hidden emotions. That bluff greeting had been a hidden wish to
drive me from some danger. But I did not speak of it, for I read that
caution in her; a very strong mental flow that fairly screamed DON'T.

This kind of fear was a wonder and a new thing to me, for danger was a
thing long banished from our life. Then she spoke, reluctantly it
seemed.

"Go to the center of the Hall of Symbols. There you

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

can ask a student or an instructor who will tell you all you need to
know."

The grip of the woman life in her left my mind and she was gone from my
vision. As I turned from the telescreen my mind insisted on visualizing
that six-armed embrace and its probable effect upon a man in love. I
shivered in spite of the warmth, but not from fear. The blood of the
Titans was alive, I thought; strangely and wonderfully alive!

I stepped into a rollat at the curb, inspected the directory, then
inserted a coin and dialed the number of the building that housed the
Hall of Symbols. I leaned back while the automatic drive of the rollat
directed the car through the speeding traffic, its electric eye more
efficient than my own.

Yes, much more efficient than my own at the moment, which were wandering
over the figure of a variform female on the walk whose upper part was
the perfect torso of a woman and whose lower part was a sinuously
gliding thirty feet of brilliantly mottled snake. You could never have
escaped her embrace of your own will once she had wrapped those
life-generating coils around you!

I thought upon it. The gen of these variforms was certainly more vital;
possibly because the Titan technicons Who lived here kept the people
healthier. Perhaps the hybrids were naturally more fecund of
micro-spore. It had indeed been a day of brainstorms, I mused, when some
old technicon had realized that not only would a strong integrative
field with a rich exd <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) supply cause all
matter to grow at an increased rate, but would also cause even the most
dissimilar life-gens to unite. It has been the realization that had
resulted in various form life. Most of the crosses by this method had
resulted in an increased strength and

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

fertility. They now were more numerous than four-limbed men, and often
superior in mental ability.

Automatically my mind associated the embrace of the snake woman with the
six arms of the giant Sybyl of Info; and I decided that I understood why
Artan Gro had driven me here with his scorn. If I didn't learn about
life here I never would anywhere. That had been what he had reasoned.

Soon I was striding between the pillaring fangs of the great beast's
mouth that was the door of the Hall of Symbols where the school ways
converged. About was the bustle attendant to any rollat way station;
bearers rushing; travelers gazing about lost in wonder at the vaulting
glitter of sculptured pillars and painted walls, done by men of a
calibre whose work ro <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) like myself
cannot grasp entirely.

Paintings and sculpture here hammered into the brain a message of the
richness of life that immense mutual effort can give the lift unit, the
pro. This richness of life was pictured in a terrible clash with evil,
its opposite. <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) The hot fecundity of
life and health growth was a sensuous blow

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

upon the eyes, the soul leaped to take a hand and make life yet more
worthwhile. I could not cease gazing at the leaping vault of pictured
busy figures whose movements culminated in that offer to the spirit of
man to join them in moulding life to a fit shape.

My rapt study of the paintings was interrupted by the sound of a pair of
hooves that clicked daintily to a stop beside me. I glanced at the
newcomer, who had stopped to stare up at the paintings also in that
curious way that people have when they see another craning his neck—and
my glance became a stare.

What was the use of aspiring to be an artist, my reason said, if those
great masters who had placed that mighty picture book on the vaulting
walls above were so easily outdone by the life force itself!

She was but a girl, younger than myself, but what a girl! Her body was
encased in a transparent glitter; her skin a rosy pale purple; her legs,
mottled with white, ended in a pair of cloven hooves. And as my brain
struggled to grasp her colorful young perfection—she wagged her tail!

It was all too much. Speculating about the life-generating force
possible in the variform creatures was one thing; but having it
materialize beside you was another thing entirely. Such a beautiful tail
it was. Of the softest, most beautiful fur.

"What were you staring at?" she asked. "The paintings?"

I stuttered, then answered. "The paintings . . . I guess . . . yes, the
paintings. I'm a . . . painter . . . was a painter . . ." I gave up. I
couldn't talk, I had to look.

"They are marvelous, aren't they," she declared enthusiastically. "I
always look at them when I come down to the school. I am studying
medicine. Now take that painting up there—"

On her arm and breast I saw the medical school insignia;

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

a man's figure struggling with a great snake, disease. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) It took brains to study medicine. This
exquisite young thing, so full of gen force, so powerfully attractive,
was smart too. And almost instantly she proved herself to be extremely
friendly and companionable. She went on talking, describing, theorizing
in a gush of amiable conversation that left me dizzy, gasping, and
admiringly breathless. She told me everything about the paintings, the
statues.

And before I realized it, we were walking on together. She was full of
all sorts of information, and it seemed she had taken it upon herself to
be my guide, to teach me the meaning of everything we saw. Her cheerful
chatter soon told me all about herself, her studies, the schools, the
great doors that led to each one from the central gathering place of the
school rollat ways.

The Hall was justly famous for these doors. Before us now was the door
to the medical school, formed of pillaring figures struggling with the
coils of snakes. Next to it was the marine school door, formed of a crab
whose huge claws met to form the arch. A planetron, a pendulum device to
tell of the nearness of bodies in space, formed the entrance to the
school of space navigation. All the ages of science of immortal growth
had combined here in the symbols that formed the many doors.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[8:2](irl02.htm#fr_1.md) According to Plato,
Atlantis was a continent located some four hundred miles west of the
Pillars of Hercules (Gibraltar). In the Timaeus, he describes it as an
island larger than Asia Minor combined with Libya. Beyond it, he says,
were an archipelago of lesser islands. Atlantis had been a powerful
kingdom nine thousand years before the birth of Solon (from whom Plato
heard of Atlantis reputedly as told to Solon by Egyptian priests), and
its armies had overrun the [Mediterranean](errata.htm#0.md) lands, when
Athens alone had resisted. (It has been a point of difference between
students as to whether Plato referred to the "Mediterranean lands" as
lands now inundated by the Mediterranean Sea, or the lands surrounding
the sea.) Finally the sea overwhelmed Atlantis and shoals marked the
spot. In the Critias Plato gives a history of the commonwealth of
Atlantis.

There are many other traditions of lands located west of Gibraltar. The
Greek Isles of the Blest or Fortunate Isles; the Welsh Avalon; the
Portuguese Antilia or Isle of Seven Cities; and St. Brendan's island.
All except Avalon were marked on maps of the 14th and 15th centuries.

The legends of the Sargasso Sea are said to have sprung from encounters
with the sea of weeds which periodically grew over the shallowly sunken
continent.—Ed.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[9:3](irl02.htm#fr_2.md) The reader will note the
curious use of the word "fall" in connection with gravity. Later in the
story, the author elaborates on the subject of gravity in a very amazing
manner, propounding a theory which your editor has examined in detail
and by which he has been utterly confounded. This glib "focusing" and
"deflecting" of gravity your editor cautions you to accept in the
literal sense until Mu-tan Mion's story gives us more on the subject of
gravity.—Ed.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[9:4](irl02.htm#fr_3.md) Curious as to the literal
meaning of the word "topless" we wrote to Mr. Shaver for a better
description of the buildings of Sub Atlan. He revealed that (as Mutan
Mion's memory told him) they were topless in the sense that they were
roofless. Sub Atlan is located in one of the giant near-surface caverns
that underlie Surface Atlan, or Atlantis, which is mostly forest with
scattered large buildings. Since the elements are not a factor, almost
all buildings are constructed without roofs to admit a maximum of light.
Sub Atlan must have presented a strange appearance, for no two buildings
were architecturally alike; some of them huge spheres, or multi-sided
geometric shapes, tall spires, or merely rambling structures of no
apparent intentional design. The reason for this was to provide variety
<span id="page_10">p. 10</span> to interest the eye, which would
otherwise be jaded by constant contemplation of the unending sameness of
gray cavern walls and roof of stone.—Ed.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[10:5](irl02.htm#fr_4.md) When asked to describe the
Titans Mr. Shaver sent us the following notation, which is perhaps the
oddest of all his communications. When queried about its oddity, he
merely replied that he had "answered your question" and gave no further
explanation. We quote:

"Our great race, the Atlans, together with the Titans, our allies and
often our fellow citizens, swarm through all known space and watch ever
for the birth of new suns. Then, too, there are the Nortans; but the
Nor-men shun all suns and can only be found where the sun rays shine
not.

"When our Atlan sciencons hear of or see a new sun born, our ships flash
swiftly through the void, to test the rays for poisonous emanations.
When they find clean heat from a surface shell of pure carbon, fast upon
their trail come the first great colonization ships. For our race is
fecund beyond imagination and there is little death from any cause."

Obviously this is nothing from the "racial" memory of Mutan Mion, but
seemingly something from an Atlan himself! Here and there, through Mr.
Shaver's correspondence with the editors, such departures from the
identity of Mutan Mion occur, and we can only suggest that Mr. Shaver's
racial memory contacts extend not only to the culture man, but to other
beings as well. Mr. Shaver himself cannot explain, and in many
instances, is unaware, that such extensions exist.

The reader will here, again, note several inexplicable references. such
as "poisonous emanations" and "a surface shell of pure carbon." Later in
the story Mutan Mion tells of these things in great detail, and in them
gives still another of the amazing scientific theories that stagger the
imagination.—Ed.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[11:6](irl02.htm#fr_5.md) Obviously variforms are
not natives of other planets, but hybrids developed from many
interplanetary life forms mated with Titans and Atlans by deliberate
applications of mutative rays in the laboratories of Mu's technicons. It
is extremely interesting to note that all have the status of
citizens.—Ed.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[12:7](irl02.htm#fr_6.md) <span id="page_11">p.
11</span> Moving connected vehicles on the ways and walks which carried
the bulk of pedestrian travel.—Ed.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[13:8](irl02.htm#fr_7.md) Exd is Atlan for
ex-disintegrance or energy ash. It was the [principal](errata.htm#1.md)
content of the beneficial vibrants. It is the space dust from which all
matter grows into being. Mutan Mion amplifies the exd theory later on in
the story.—Ed.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[14:9](irl02.htm#fr_8.md) Here again we had to
appeal to Mr. Shaver for amplification. We certainly got it, and along
with it some amazing thoughts. Ro (he says) is a thing of simple
repetitive life pattern easy to understand and control. To ro you is to
make you do things against your will. A large generator of thought
impulse can be set up to ro a whole group of people. Row the boat is
modern and the meaning has become physical force and not mental force.
Ro the people was an ancient method of government. Romantic was the name
of such a government. Ro-man-tic (science of man life patterning by
control). It is the same concept as used by some scientists when they
say "hypnotically conditioned." It is <span id="page_15">p. 15</span>
not necessarily an evil government method, but is one that was
necessary. Any person is ro who is weaker than the mental impulses about
him. Men are ro today because they are not self-determining, though they
think they are. We are parts of a huge juggernaut, and we are ro in
consequence. The determining forces that make our thought what it is are
from outside when we are ro, from inside when we are men or gods.—Ed.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[14:10](irl02.htm#fr_9.md) This is indeed a strange
comparison. Evil is the opposite of live, the inference being that to be
evil is to die. Oddly (or significantly?) evil is live spelled
backward.—Ed.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[16:11](irl02.htm#fr_10.md) This insignia lives
today in the legend of Apollo! According to the Greeks, Apollo was a son
of Zeus himself. Disease is typified in the legend by the python, which
Apollo killed. Etymologically his name signifies one who "drives away
disease." Roscher's derivation names him as the "sun god." Using Mr.
Shaver's ancient language, he is "authority, energizer, power source of
man's growth." This is startling when we discover, upon studying the
legends of Apollo, that he was variously called god of prophecy; god of
agriculture; ruler of seasons; keeper of flocks; rearer of boys; sponsor
of gymnastics; the helper; healer and seer; averter of evil; god of song
and music; leader of the muses; embarker and disembarker; god of streets
and ways; one who stands before the house (as protector from violence
and disease); originator and protector of civil order; founder of cities
and legislation. Apollo, says Mutan Mion, was a son of one of the Titans
of Mu!—Ed.
