           Associated .GIF files :  SAUCER1.GIF - original B/W UFO photo
                                    S1ENH.GIF   - enhanced version of SAUCER1
                                    ED13BIG.GIF - Gulf Breeze UFO
                                    FOTO386.GIF - Italian UFO

           Lee sent us  a  quite fascinating picture, S1ENH.GIF.  It is a black
           and white picture of one of the ADAMSKI  UFO photos that was scanned
           into the computer  and  hen  run through a program  called  IMPROCES
           which is now listed on KeelyNet courtesy of Lee.

           The black and  white version shows cloud/vapor formations around the
           ship which are quite obvious in  the  enhanced  version.   Both  the
           black and white original and the enhanced version were  included  by
           Lee for comparison.

           The IMPROCES program  allows  you  to  use  different color palettes
           under which to view files.  That is  what  was done with the ADAMSKI
           image.  Of course,  it  is designed as a paint program.   There  are
           other paint programs which have the palette exchange ability, so you
           should try it with the ones you have.  Some paint programs also have
           FILTERS that might be useful (such as Publishers Paintbrush).

           As Lee points out, the normal image in black and white shows nothing
           unusual beyond your  standard  up  close  UFO photo , yet when
           viewed with the color palette, it  shows some kind of energy wave in
           front of the shape and some kind of void behind it.  When looking at
           the black and white version closely, you can see some  kind of cloud
           or vapor rim that might relate to the enhanced version.

           A quite fascinating  treatment and one that opens up some intriguing
           possibilities for the viewing of anomalous  photos  such as psychic,
           paranormal, Fortean, UFO or other odd events that are  lucky  enough
           to be photographed.

           One of our  friends  knows  Wendell Stevens out in Arizona.  He says
           Wendell has hundreds of original Meier photos and will try to borrow
           a few that can be scanned in and  enhanced  using  this  process  or
           others.  It might shed some light on the propulsion system.

           We suggest if you have any photos or .GIFs that you  experiment with
           this program or  similar  ones.   You never know what YOU may be the
           discoverer of.
