    Things to beware of in 1997:

    Continued 'govermental' pushes to pass legislation to take away what
    few rights remain to the American people... Beware such laws which
    purport to 'protect' children but only serve to 'control' the
    parent!! -- Beware such laws with purport to 'protect' people from
    'illegal firearms' but whose true purpose is to keep 'any' firearms
    out of the hands of the people so they can NOT resist the coming
    oppresion of the 'New World Order'!!

    Attention has now shifted to Marshall Applewhite who figures somewhat in
    the early history of "Heaven's Gate".

    Here's an entry from "Encyclopedia Jill":

    H.I.M. [Human Individual Metamorphosis] Flying saucer cult founded in 1975
    in the American West by Bo and Peep, an unmarried, middle-aged couple whose
    real names were Herf Applewhite and Bonnie Lu Trousdale Nettles of Houston,
    Texas. They claimed that they would lead their followers to a literal
    ascension into Heaven via spacecraft. They began holding meetings in
    various locations throughout the west when their followers began following
    them around, from one camp to another, from Oregon to Nebraska. Bo & Peep
    told their followers that they would eventually be assassinated, then rise
    to lead them to the spacecraft. One devotee remarked, "We've got to get
    them killed... that's the only way we're ever going to get off!" Herf
    studied music and taught at St. Thomas College. Ms. Nettles studied nursing
    and astrology. In 1972, the couple formed the Christian Arts Center in
    Houston, sponsoring lectures on theosophy, mysticism, meditation,
    astrology, etc. The couple was living together but renounced sex. The two
    claimed that they had both come from the "heavenly kingdom" into the wombs
    of women as "space fetuses: with a mission to prepare others for the Second
    Coming and ascension of faithful into heaven via UFO. They used the names
    Bo and Peep and other nonsensical names to emphasize their anonymity.
    H.I.M.'s caravan wended its way through Colorado, Wyoming, Arizona,
    Washington, Oregon and Nebraska. Current status unknown. [Hayden Hughes,
    Brad Steiger, UFO Missionaries Extraordinary, 1976.]

    In "Crop Circle Connector Truthseekers 8" we find:

    Bo and Peep, formerly known as Bonnie Nettles and Marshall Applewhite. In
    1975 this Californian couple founded a movement called Human Individual
    Metamorphosis (HIM for short), which greatly appealed to followers of New
    Age philosophies. HIM was an early version of the present-day Ascension
    movement. Bo and Peep, also known as The Two, preached that death could be
    overcome through physical ascension into another realm beyond the confines
    of planet Earth. One of their publicity posters read: "UFOs - Why they are
    here. Who they have come for. When they will land. Two individuals say they
    were sent from the level above human and will return to that level in a
    spaceship (UFO) within the next three months. This man and woman will
    discuss how the transition from the human level to the next level is
    accomplished, and when this may be done. If you have ever entertained the
    idea that there might be a real physical level in space beyond the Earth's
    confines, you will want to attend this meeting." Members of this group were
    expected to give up their names, belongings, radios, televisions, books,
    and become celibate. They lived in communes and were forced to lead a
    detached lifestyle, in constant anticipation of their imminent physical
    ascension. Gradually, members began to get disillusioned because no-one was
    ascending and the prophecies made by Bo and Beep would pass without
    incident. Many followers were ripped off financially, and it was later
    learned that Bo and Peep had befriended one another in a psychiatric
    hospital; where she was a nurse and he was a patient. They also had
    criminal records, having been arrested on charges of car theft and credit
    card fraud...
