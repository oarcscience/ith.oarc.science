### Gulf Breeze Sighting

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Date: Fri, 24 May 1996 07:48:01 -0400
    Subject: New sighting last night in Gulf Breeze

    To all interested parties:

    Wednesday May 22nd, 1996
    Gulf Breeze/Pensacola Beach Florida
    10:10pm

    Four people on the fishing pier witness 2 black triangular shaped
    craft flying in formation at about 5,000 feet.  Each had a small
    orange light in each corner.  The objects flew west to east toward
    EGILN AIR BASE.  The witnesses reported that the craft were
    completely silent as they passed over the unsuspecting heads of
    about 150 people who were near the dock on the beach boardwalk.
    One of the wintesses was an intern for The North American
    Paranormal Network/TERRA NOVA.

    We have tried contacting Pensacola Airport and EGLIN but have
    received no "official" response as of yet.  We will pass along more
    information as we investigate.

    One important note is that the same two craft were reported the
    previous night further down the beach at 9:45pm by two witnesses.
    We do stress that these craft do not appear to be the AURORA which
    is suppossedly being used out of EGLIN right now.  More information
    as we receive it.  Thanks.
