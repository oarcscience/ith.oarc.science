           Subject: 1991 Crop Circles
           Date   : 21 Oct 91 03:08:00 GMT

           Michael Chorost, Director of North American Circle, P.O. Box 61144
           Durham, NC 27715-1144 has just sent me a copy of his latest report
           entitled _The Summer 1991 Crop Circles: The Data Emerges_,
           published by the Fund for UFO Research, P.O. Box 277, Mt. Ranier,
           MD 20712. What follows is extracted from his report.

           Marshall Dudley believes he has identified yttrium-88 and bismuth-
           205 in soil samples taken from the oval formation at Beckhampton,
           U.K. formed on August 2/3, 1991.

           These are non-naturally occurring  short-lived  isotopes,  so  their
           presence, once confirmed, will be of great interest.  (Y-88's  half-
           life is 107 days; Bi-205's is 15.3 days.)

           The samples also registered sky-high alpha/beta particle readings of
           198% / 45%  respectively when compared to control samples. Dudley is
           a systems engineer  for  Tennelec/Nucleus  of  Oak  Ridge,  TN,  and
           manufactures gas flow  counters, which are instruments  designed  to
           detect extremely minute quantities of alpha and beta radiation.

           Dr. W.C. Levengood, a biophysicist living in Michigan, specializing
           in plant and   seed  development,  has  also  made  some  remarkable
           discoveries. One was that the growth  nodes  on  plants  taken  from
           within authentic circles had become significantly enlarged when
           compared to control plants.

           He hypothesizes that some energy input, possibly  heat,  caused  the
           cells in those nodes to swell, causing lasting but not fatal damage.
           Mechanically hoaxed circles did not exhibit the same effect.

           Secondly, Levengood discovered   a  high  incidence  (40%)  of  seed
           malformation in plants taken from  the  Newton  St.  Loe  formation,
           whereas virtually all control seeds were normal.

           Thirdly, microscopic examination of the node cells revealed that the
           pits in their cell walls had become larger and more visible. This is
           what Levengood hypothesizes would occur if something heated the

                                          Page 1





           water inside the  cells  so  rapidly that the cell walls swelled and
           forced the pits to expand.

           Michael also mentions the plasma vortex quintuplet sets that I have
           observed, photographed/video-taped, and previously posted applicable
           documentation about on this echo.

           There is much  more  information   and  substantiation  in  Michaels
           report, which I would be happy to share with those interested.

           Michael's conclusions are summarized as follows:

                1) The phenomenon induces radiation anomalies.
                2) It appears the plants are heated both rapidly  and  briefly.
                3) Plants are sometimes scorched, particularly grasses.
                4) Plant  cell  walls swell, elongating cell wall pits, leaving
                   "stretch marks".
                5) Induced developmental anomalies in seeds.
                6) The circles may correlate  with  aquifers  (water  saturated
                   rocks such as chalk and limestone)
                7) The  circles  do correlate, at least grossly,  with  ancient
                   megaliths.
                8) The quintuplet may be artificially duplicable.
                9) Hoaxes  may be able to be distinguished from genuine circles
                   with laboratory tests.
               10) Some formations may represent  or  symbolize  known objects.
               11) The circles do correlate geographically with some well
                   documented sightings   of   unidentified   luminous   aerial
                   objects.

           Thanks Michael, for your admirable achievement...Sheldon

           Vangard note...

                We suggest  you  read CIRCLES1.ASC on KeelyNet and you will see
                many tie-ins with our hypothesis that the circles are caused by
                precisely directed  UV lasers  in  micro-bursts  to  cause  DNA
                denaturation, heating,   stretch   marks  from   heat   induced
                expansion, anomalies in the form of low level mutation, etc..
