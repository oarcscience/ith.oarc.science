### CHAPTER THREE

#### The Classics

1948 was only one hour and twenty-five minutes old when a gentleman from
Abilene, Texas, made the first UFO report of the year. What he saw, "a
fan-shaped glow" in the sky, was insignificant as far as UFO

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

reports go, but it ushered in a year that was to bring feverish activity
to Project Sign.

With the Soviets practically eliminated as a UFO source, the idea of
interplanetary spaceships was becoming more popular. During 1948 the
people in ATIC were openly discussing the possibility of interplanetary
visitors without others tapping their heads and looking smug. During
1948 the novelty of UFO's had worn off for the press and every John and
Jane Doe who saw one didn't make the front pages as in 1947. Editors
were becoming hardened, only a few of the best reports got any space.
Only "The Classics" rated headlines. "The Classics" were three historic
reports that were the highlights of 1948. They are called "The
Classics," a name given them by the Project Blue Book staff, because:
(1) they are classic examples of how the true facts of a UFO report can
be twisted and warped by some writers to prove their point, (2) they are
the most highly publicized reports of this early era of the UFO's, and
(3) they "proved" to ATIC's intelligence specialists that UFO's were
real.

The apparent lack of interest in UFO reports by the press was not a true
indication of the situation. I later found out, from talking to writers,
that all during 1948 the interest in UFO's was running high. The Air
Force Press Desk in the Pentagon was continually being asked what
progress was being made in the UFO investigation. The answer was, "Give
us time. This job can't be done in a week." The press respected this and
was giving them time. But every writer worth his salt has contacts,
those "usually reliable sources" you read about, and these contacts were
talking. All during 1948 contacts in the Pentagon were telling how UFO
reports were rolling in at the rate of several per day and how ATIC UFO
investigation teams were flying out of Dayton to investigate them. They
were telling how another Air Force investigative organization had been
called in to lighten ATIC's load and allow ATIC to concentrate on the
analysis of the reports. The writers knew this was true because they had
crossed paths with these men whom they had mistakenly identified as FBI
agents. The FBI was never officially interested in UFO sightings. The
writers' contacts in the airline industry told about the UFO talk from
V.P.'s down to the ramp boys. Dozens of good, solid, reliable,
experienced airline pilots were seeing UFO's. All of this led to one
conclusion: whatever the Air Force had to say, when it was ready to
talk, would be newsworthy. But the Air Force wasn't ready to talk.

Project Sign personnel were just getting settled down to work after the
New Year's holiday when the "ghost rockets" came back to the
Scandinavian countries of Europe. Air attachés in Sweden, Denmark, and

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Norway fired wires
to ATIC telling about the reports. Wires went back asking for more
information.

The "ghost rockets," so tagged by the newspapers, had first been seen in
the summer of 1946, a year before the first UFO sighting in the U.S.
There were many different descriptions for the reported objects. They
were usually seen in the hours of darkness and almost always traveling
at extremely high speeds. They were shaped like a ball or projectile,
were a bright green, white, red, or yellow and sometimes made sounds.
Like their American cousins, they were always so far away that no
details could be seen. For no good reason, other than speculation and
circulation, the newspapers had soon begun to refer authoritatively to
these "ghost rockets" as guided missiles, and implied that they were
from Russia. Peenemünde, the great German missile development center and
birthplace of the V-1 and V-2 guided missiles, came in for its share of
suspicion since it was held by the Russians. By the end of the summer of
1946 the reports were widespread, coming from Denmark, Norway, Spain,
Greece, French Morocco, Portugal, and Turkey. In 1947, after no definite
conclusions as to identity of the "rockets" had been established, the
reports died out. Now in early January 1948 they broke out again. But
Project Sign personnel were too busy to worry about European UFO
reports, they were busy at home. A National Guard pilot had just been
killed chasing a UFO.

On January 7 all of the late papers in the U.S. carried headlines
similar to those in the Louisville *Courier:* "F-51 and Capt. Mantell
Destroyed Chasing Flying Saucer." This was Volume I of "The Classics,"
the Mantell Incident.

At one-fifteen on that afternoon the control tower operators at Godman
AFB, outside Louisville, Kentucky, received a telephone call from the
Kentucky State Highway Patrol. The patrol wanted to know if Godman Tower
knew anything about any unusual aircraft in the vicinity. Several people
from Maysville, Kentucky, a small town 80 miles east of Louisville, had
reported seeing a strange aircraft. Godman knew that they had nothing in
the vicinity so they called Flight Service at Wright-Patterson AFB. In a
few minutes Flight Service called back. Their air Traffic control board
showed no flights in the area. About twenty minutes later the state
police called again. This time people from the towns of Owensboro and
Irvington, Kentucky, west of Louisville, were reporting a strange craft.
The report from these two towns was a little more complete. The
townspeople had described the object to the state police as being
"circular, about 250 to 300 feet in diameter," and moving westward at a
"pretty good

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

clip." Godman Tower checked Flight Service again. Nothing. All this time
the tower operators had been looking for the reported object. They
theorized that since the UFO had had to pass north of Godman to get from
Maysville to Owensboro it might come back.

At one forty-five they saw it, or something like it. Later, in his
official report, the assistant tower operator said that he had seen the
object for several minutes before he called his chief's attention to it.
He said that he had been reluctant to "make a flying saucer report." As
soon as the two men in the tower had assured themselves that the UFO
they saw was not an airplane or a weather balloon, they called Flight
Operations. They wanted the operations officer to see the UFO. Before
long word of the sighting had gotten around to key personnel on the
base, and several officers, besides the base operations officer and the
base intelligence officer, were in the tower. All of them looked at the
UFO through the tower's 6 × 50 binoculars and decided they couldn't
identify it. About this time Colonel Hix, the base commander, arrived.
He looked and he was baffled. At two-thirty, they reported, they were
discussing what should be done when four F-51's came into view,
approaching the base from the south.

The tower called the flight leader, Captain Mantell, and asked him to
take a look at the object and try to identify it. One F-51 in the flight
was running low on fuel, so he asked permission to go on to his base.
Mantell took his two remaining wing men, made a turn, and started after
the UFO. The people in Godman Tower were directing him as none of the
pilots could see the object at this time. They gave Mantell an initial
heading toward the south and the flight was last seen heading in the
general direction of the UFO.

By the time the F-5 l's had climbed to 10,000 feet, the two wing men
later reported, Mantell had pulled out ahead of them and they could just
barely see him. At two forty-five Mantell called the tower and said, "I
see something above and ahead of me and I'm still climbing." All the
people in the tower heard Mantell say this and they heard one of the
wing men call back and ask, "What the hell are we looking for?" The
tower immediately called Mantell and asked him for a description of what
he saw. Odd as it may seem, no one can remember exactly what he
answered. Saucer historians have credited him with saying, "I've sighted
the thing. It looks metallic and it's tremendous in size. . . . Now it's
starting to climb." Then in a few seconds he is supposed to have called
and said, "It's above me and I'm gaining on it. I'm going to 20,000
feet." Everyone in the tower agreed on this one last bit of the
transmission, "I'm going to 20,000 feet," but didn't agree on the first
part, about the UFO's being metallic and tremendous.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

The two wing men were now at 15,000 feet and trying frantically to call
Mantell. He had climbed far above them by this time and was out of
sight. Since none of them had any oxygen they were worried about
Mantell. Their calls were not answered. Mantell never talked to anyone
again. The two wing men leveled off at 15,000 feet, made another
fruitless effort to call Mantell, and started to come back down. As they
passed Godman Tower on their way to their base, one of them said
something to the effect that all he had seen was a reflection on his
canopy.

When they landed at their base, Standiford Field, just north of Godman,
one pilot had his F-51 refueled and serviced with oxygen, and took off
to search the area again. He didn't see anything.

At three-fifty the tower lost sight of the UFO. A few minutes later they
got word that Mantell had crashed and was dead.

Several hours later, at 7:20 P.M., airfield towers all over the Midwest
sent in frantic reports of another UFO. In all about a dozen airfield
towers reported the UFO as being low on the southwestern horizon and
disappearing after about twenty minutes. The writers of saucer lore say
this UFO was what Mantell was chasing when he died; the Air Force says
*this* UFO was Venus.

The people on Project Sign worked fast on the Mantell Incident.
Contemplating a flood of queries from the press as soon as they heard
about the crash, they realized that they had to get a quick answer.
Venus had been the target of a chase by an Air Force F-51 several weeks
before and there were similarities between this sighting and the Mantell
Incident. So almost before the rescue crews had reached the crash, the
word "Venus" went out. This satisfied the editors, and so it stood for
about a year; Mantell had unfortunately been killed trying to reach the
planet Venus.

To the press, the nonchalant, offhand manner with which the sighting was
written off by the Air Force public relations officer showed great
confidence in the conclusion, Venus, but behind the barbed-wire fence
that encircled ATIC the nonchalant attitude didn't exist among the
intelligence analysts. One man had already left for Louisville and the
rest were doing some tall speculating. The story about the tower-to-air
talk, "It looks metallic and it's tremendous in size," spread fast.
Rumor had it that the tower had carried on a running conversation with
the pilots and that there was more information than was so far known.
Rumor also had it that this conversation had been recorded.
Unfortunately neither of these rumors was true.

Over a period of several weeks the file on the Mantell Incident grew

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

in size until it was the most thoroughly investigated sighting of that
time, at least the file was the thickest.

About a year later the Air Force released its official report on the
incident. To use a trite term, it was a masterpiece in the art of
"weasel wording." It said that the UFO might have been Venus or it could
have been a balloon. Maybe two balloons. It probably was Venus except
that this is doubtful because Venus was too dim to be seen in the
afternoon. This jolted writers who had been following the UFO story.
Only a few weeks before, *The Saturday Evening Post* had published a
two-part story entitled "What You Can Believe about Flying Saucers." The
story had official sanction and had quoted the Venus theory as a
positive solution. To clear up the situation, several writers were
allowed to interview a major in the Pentagon, who was the Air Force's
Pentagon "expert" on UFO's. The major was asked directly about the
conclusion of the Mantel\] Incident, and he flatly stated that it was
Venus. The writers pointed out the official Air Force analysis. The
major's answer was, "They checked again and it was Venus." He didn't
know who "they" were, where they had checked, or what they had checked,
but it was Venus. The writers then asked, "If there was a later report
they had made why wasn't it used as a conclusion?" "Was it available?"
The answer to the last question was "No," and the lid snapped back down.
This interview gave the definite impression that the Air Force was
unsuccessfully trying to cover up some very important information, using
Venus as a front. Nothing excites a newspaper or magazine writer more
than to think he has stumbled onto a big story and that someone is
trying to cover it up. Many writers thought this after the interview
with the major, and many still think it. You can't really blame them,
either.

In early 1952 I got a telephone call on ATIC's direct line to the
Pentagon. It was a colonel in the Director of Intelligence's office. The
Office of Public Information had been getting a number of queries about
all of the confusion over the Mantell Incident. What was the answer?

I dug out the file. In 1949 all of the original material on the incident
had been microfilmed, but something had been spilled on the film. Many
sections were so badly faded they were illegible. As I had to do with
many of the older sightings that were now history, I collected what I
could from the file, filling in the blanks by talking to people who had
been at ATIC during the early UFO era. Many of these people were still
around, "Red" Honnacker, George Towles, Al Deyarmond, Nick Post, and
many others. Most of them were civilians, the military had been
transferred out by this time.

Some of the press clippings in the file mentioned the Pentagon major

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

and his concrete proof of Venus. I couldn't find this concrete proof in
the file so I asked around about the major. The major, I found, was an
officer in the Pentagon who had at one time written a short intelligence
summary about UFO's. He had never been stationed at ATIC, nor was he
especially well versed on the UFO problem. When the word of the press
conference regarding the Mantell Incident came down, a UFO expert was
needed. The major, because of his short intelligence summary on UFO's,
became the "expert." He had evidently conjured up "they" and "their
later report" to support his Venus answer because the writers at the
press conference had him in a corner. I looked farther.

Fortunately the man who had done the most extensive work on the
incident, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, head of the Ohio State University
Astronomy Department, could be contacted. I called Dr. Hynek and
arranged to meet him the next day.

Dr. Hynek was one of the most impressive scientists I met while working
on the UFO project, and I met a good many. He didn't do two things that
some of them did: give you the answer before he knew the question; or
immediately begin to expound on his accomplishments in the field of
science. I arrived at Ohio State just before lunch, and Dr. Hynek
invited me to eat with him at the faculty club. He wanted to refer to
some notes he had on the Mantell Incident and they were in his office,
so we discussed UFO's in general during lunch.

Back in his office he started to review the Mantell Incident. He had
been responsible for the weasel-worded report that the Air Force
released in late 1949, and he apologized for it. Had he known that it
was going to cause so much confusion, he said, he would have been more
specific. He thought the incident was a dead issue. The reason that
Venus had been such a strong suspect was that it was in almost the same
spot in the sky as the UFO. Dr. Hynek referred to his notes and told me
that at 3:00 P.M., Venus had been south southwest of Godman and 33
degrees above the southern horizon. At 3:00 P.M. the people in the tower
estimated the UFO to be southwest of Godman and at an elevation of about
45 degrees. Allowing for human error in estimating directions and
angles, this was close. I agreed. There was one big flaw in the theory,
however. Venus wasn't bright enough to be seen. He had computed the
brilliance of the planet, and on the day in question it was only six
times as bright as the surrounding sky. Then he explained what this
meant. Six times may sound like a lot, but it isn't. When you start
looking for a pinpoint of light only six times as bright as the
surrounding sky, it's almost impossible to find it, even on a clear day.

Dr. Hynek said that he didn't think that the UFO was Venus.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

I later found out that although it was a relatively clear day there was
considerable haze.

I asked him about some of the other possibilities. He repeated the
balloon, canopy-reflection, and sundog theories but he refused to
comment on them since, as he said, he was an astrophysicist and would
care to comment only on the astrophysical aspects of the sightings.

I drove back to Dayton convinced that the UFO wasn't Venus. Dr. Hynek
had said Venus would have been a pinpoint of light. The people in the
tower had been positive of their descriptions, their statements brought
that out. They couldn't agree on a description, they called the UFO "a
parachute," "an ice cream cone tipped with red," "round and white,"
"huge and silver or metallic," "a small white object," "one fourth the
size of the full moon," but all the descriptions plainly indicated a
large ' object. None of the descriptions could even vaguely be called a
pinpoint of light.

This aspect of a definite shape seemed to eliminate the sundog theory
too. Sundogs, or parhelia, as they are technically known, are caused by
ice particles reflecting a diffused light. This would not give a sharp
outline. I also recalled two instances where Air Force pilots had chased
sundogs. In both instances when the aircraft began to climb, the sundog
disappeared. This was because the angle of reflection changed as the
airplane climbed several thousand feet. These sundog-caused UFO's also
had fuzzy edges.

I had always heard a lot of wild speculation about the condition of
Mantell's crashed F-51, so I wired for a copy of the accident report. It
arrived several days after my visit with Dr. Hynek. The report said that
the F-51 had lost a wing due to excessive speed in a dive after Mantell
had "blacked out" due to the lack of oxygen. Mantell's body had not
burned, not disintegrated, and was not full of holes; the wreck was not
radioactive, nor was it magnetized.

One very important and pertinent question remained. Why did Mantell, an
experienced pilot, try to go to 20,000 feet when he didn't even have an
oxygen mask? If he had run out of oxygen, it would have been different.
Every pilot and crewman has it pounded into him, "Do not, under any
circumstances, go above 15,000 feet without oxygen." In high-altitude
indoctrination during World War II, I made several trips up to 30,000
feet in a pressure chamber. To demonstrate anoxia we would leave our
oxygen masks off until we became dizzy. A few of the more hardy souls
could get to 15,000 feet, but nobody ever got over 17,000. Possibly
Mantell thought he could climb up to 20,000 in a hurry and get back down
before he got anoxia and blacked out, but this would be a foolish

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

chance. This point was covered in the sighting report. A long-time
friend of Mantell's went on record as saying that he'd flown with him
several years and knew him personally. He couldn't conceive of Mantell's
even thinking about disregarding his lack of oxygen. Mantell was one of
the most cautious pilots he knew. "The only thing I can think," he
commented, "was that he was after something that he believed to be more
important than his life or his family."

My next step was to try to find out what Mantell's wing men had seen or
thought but this was a blind alley. All of this evidence was in the
ruined portion of the microfilm, even their names were missing. The only
reference I could find to them was a vague passage indicating they
hadn't seen anything.

I concentrated on the canopy-reflection theory. It is widely believed
that many flying saucers appear to pilots who are actually chasing a
reflection on their canopy. I checked over all the reports we had on
file. I couldn't find one that had been written off for this reason. I
dug back into my own flying experience and talked to a dozen pilots. All
of us had momentarily been startled by a reflection on the aircraft's
canopy or wing, but in a second or two it had been obvious that it was a
reflection. Mantell chased the object for at least fifteen to twenty
minutes, and it is inconceivable that he wouldn't realize in that length
of time that he was chasing a reflection.

About the only theory left to check was that the object might have been
one of the big, 100-foot-diameter, "skyhook" balloons. I rechecked the
descriptions of the UFO made by the people in the tower. The first man
to sight the object called it a parachute; others said ice cream cone,
round, etc. All of these descriptions fit a balloon. Buried deep in the
file were two more references to balloons that I had previously missed.
Not long after the object had disappeared from view at Godman AFB, a man
from Madisonville, Kentucky, called Flight Service in Dayton. He had
seen an object traveling southeast. He had looked at it through a
telescope and it was a balloon. At four forty-five an astronomer living
north of Nashville, Tennessee, called in. He had also seen a UFO, looked
at it through a telescope, and it was a balloon.

In the thousands of words of testimony and evidence taken on the Mantell
Incident this was the only reference to balloons. I had purposely not
paid too much attention to this possibility because I was sure that it
had been thoroughly checked back in 1948. Now I wasn't sure.

I talked with one of the people who had been in on the Mantell
investigation. The possibility of a balloon's causing the sighting had
been mentioned but hadn't been followed up for two reasons. Number one

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

was that everybody at ATIC was convinced that the object Mantell was
after was a spaceship and that this was the only course they had
pursued. When the sighting grew older and no spaceship proof could be
found, everybody jumped on the Venus band wagon, as this theory had
"already been established." It was an easy way out. The second reason
was that a quick check had been made on weather balloons and none were
in the area. The big skyhook balloon project was highly classified at
that time, and since they were all convinced that the object was of
interplanetary origin (a minority wanted to give the Russians credit),
they didn't want to bother to buck the red tape of security to get data
on skyhook flights.

The group who supervise the contracts for all the skyhook research
flights for the Air Force are located at Wright Field, so I called them.
They had no records on flights in 1948 but they did think that the big
balloons were being launched from Clinton County AFB in southern Ohio at
that time. They offered to get the records of the winds on January 7 and
see what flight path a balloon launched in southwestern Ohio would have
taken. In a few days they had the data for me.

Unfortunately the times of the first sightings, from the towns outside
Louisville, were not exact but it was possible to partially reconstruct
the sequence of events. The winds were such that a skyhook balloon
launched from Clinton County AFB could be seen from the town east of
Godman AFB, the town from which the first UFO was reported to the
Kentucky State Police. It is not unusual to be able to see a large
balloon for 50 to 60 miles. The balloon could have traveled west for a
while, climbing as it moved with the strong east winds that were blowing
that day and picking up speed as the winds got stronger at altitude. In
twenty minutes it could have been in a position where it could be seen
from Owensboro and Irvington, Kentucky, the two towns west of Godman.
The second reports to the state police had come from these two towns.
Still climbing, the balloon would have reached a level where a strong
wind was blowing in a southerly direction. The jet-stream winds were not
being plotted in 1948 but the weather chart shows strong indications of
a southerly bend in the jet stream for this day. Jet stream or not, the
balloon would have moved rapidly south, still climbing. At a point
somewhere south or southwest of Godman it would have climbed through the
southerly-moving winds to a calm belt at about 60,000 feet. At this
level it would slowly drift south or southeast. A skyhook balloon can be
seen at 60,000.

When first seen by the people in Godman Tower, the UFO was south of the
air base. It was relatively close and looked "like a parachute," which a
balloon does. During the two hours that it was in sight, the observers
reported that it seemed to hover, yet each observer estimated the time

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

he looked at the object through the binoculars and timewise the
descriptions ran "huge," "small," "one fourth the size of a full moon,"
"one tenth the size of a full moon." Whatever the UFO was, it was slowly
moving away. As the balloon continued to drift in a southerly direction
it would have picked up stronger winds, and could have easily been seen
by the astronomers in Madisonville, Kentucky, and north of Nashville an
hour after it disappeared from view at Godman.

Somewhere in the archives of the Air Force or the Navy there are records
that will show whether or not a balloon was launched from Clinton County
AFB, Ohio, on January 7, 1948. I never could find these records. People
who were working with the early skyhook projects "remember" operating
out of Clinton County AFB in 1947 but refuse to be pinned down to a
January 7 flight. Maybe, they said.

The Mantell Incident is the same old UFO jigsaw puzzle. By assuming the
shape of one piece, a balloon launched from southwestern Ohio, the whole
picture neatly falls together. It shows a huge balloon that Captain
Thomas Mantell died trying to reach. He didn't know that he was chasing
a balloon because he had never heard of a huge, 100-foot-diameter
skyhook balloon, let alone seen one. Leave out the one piece of the
jigsaw puzzle and the picture is a UFO, "metallic and tremendous in
size."

It *could* have been a balloon. This is the answer I phoned back to the
Pentagon.

During January and February of 1948 the reports of "ghost rockets"
continued to come from air attachés in foreign countries near the Baltic
Sea. People in North Jutland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and Germany
reported "balls of fire traveling slowly across the sky." The reports
were very sketchy and incomplete, most of them accounts from newspapers.
In a few days the UFO's were being seen all over Europe and South
America. Foreign reports hit a peak in the latter part of February and
U.S. newspapers began to pick up the stories.

The Swedish Defense Staff supposedly conducted a comprehensive study of
the incidents and concluded that they were all explainable in terms of
astronomical phenomena. Since this was UFO history, I made several
attempts to get some detailed and official information on this report
and the sightings, but I was never successful.

The ghost rockets left in March, as mysteriously as they had arrived.

All during the spring of 1948 good reports continued to come in. Some
were just run-of-the-mill but a large percentage of them were good,
coming from people whose reliability couldn't be questioned. For
example, three scientists reported that for thirty seconds they had
watched a round object streak across the sky in a highly erratic flight
path near the Army's secret

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> White Sands
Proving Ground. And on May 28 the crew of an Air Force C-47 had three
UFO's barrel in from "twelve o'clock high" to buzz their transport.

On July 21 a curious report was received from the Netherlands. The day
before several persons reported seeing a UFO through high broken clouds
over The Hague. The object was rocket-shaped, with two rows of windows
along the side. It was a poor report, very sketchy and incomplete, and
it probably would have been forgotten except that four nights later a
similar UFO almost collided with an Eastern Airlines DC-3. This near
collision is Volume II of "The Classics."

On the evening of July 24, 1948, an Eastern Airlines DC-3 took off from
Houston, Texas. It was on a scheduled trip to Atlanta, with intermediate
stops in between. The pilots were Clarence S. Chiles and John B.
Whitted. At about 2:45 A.M., when the flight was 20 miles southwest of
Montgomery, the captain, Chiles, saw a light dead ahead and closing
fast. His first reaction, he later reported to an ATIC investigation
team, was that it was a jet, but in an instant he realized that even a
jet couldn't close as fast as this light was closing. Chiles said he
reached over, gave Whitted, the other pilot, a quick tap on the arm, and
pointed. The UFO was now almost on top of them. Chiles racked the DC-3
into a tight left turn. Just as the UFO flashed by about 700 feet to the
right, the DC-3 hit turbulent air. Whitted looked back just as the UFO
pulled up in a steep climb.

Both the pilots had gotten a good look at the UFO and were able to give
a good description to the Air Force intelligence people. It was a B-29
fuselage. The underside had a "deep blue glow." There were "two rows of
windows from which bright lights glowed," and a "50-foot trail of
orange-red flame" shot out the back.

Only one passenger was looking out of the window at the time. The ATIC
investigators talked to him. He said he saw a "strange, eerie streak of
light, very intense," but that was all, no details. He said that it all
happened before he could adjust his eyes to the darkness.

Minutes later a crew chief at Robins Air Force Base in Macon, Georgia,
reported seeing an extremely bright light pass overhead, traveling at a
high speed. A few days later another report from the night of July 24
came in. A pilot, flying near the Virginia-North Carolina state line,
reported that he had seen a "bright shooting star" in the direction of
Montgomery, Alabama, at about the exact time the Eastern Airlines DC-3
was "buzzed."

According to the old timers at ATIC, this report shook them worse than
the Mantell Incident. This was the first time two reliable sources had
been really close enough to anything resembling a UFO to get a good

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

look and live to tell about it. A quick check on a map showed that the
UFO that nearly collided with the airliner would have passed almost over
Macon, Georgia, after passing the DC-3. It had been turning toward Macon
when last seen. The story of the crew chief at Robins AFB, 200 miles
away, seemed to confirm the sighting, not to mention the report from
near the Virginia-North Carolina state line.

In intelligence, if you have something to say about some vital problem
you write a report that is known as an "Estimate of the Situation." A
few days after the DC-3 was buzzed, the people at ATIC decided that the
time had arrived to make an Estimate of the Situation. The situation was
the UFO's; the estimate was that they were interplanetary!

It was a rather thick document with a black cover and it was printed on
legal-sized paper. Stamped across the front were the words TOP SECRET.

It contained the Air Force's analysis of many of the incidents I have
told you about plus many similar ones. All of them had come from
scientists, pilots, and other equally credible observers, and each one
was an unknown.

The document pointed out that the reports hadn't actually started with
the Arnold Incident. Belated reports from a weather observer in
Richmond, Virginia, who observed a "silver disk" through his theodolite
telescope; an F-47 pilot and three pilots in his formation who saw a
"silver flying wing," and the English "ghost airplanes" that had been
picked up on radar early in 1947 proved this point. Although reports on
them were not received until after the Arnold sighting, these incidents
all had taken place earlier.

When the estimate was completed, typed, and approved, it started up
through channels to higher-command echelons. It drew considerable
comment but no one stopped it on its way up.

A matter of days after the Estimate of the Situation was signed, sealed.
and sent on its way, the third big sighting of 1948, Volume III of "The
Classics," took place. The date was October 1, and the place was Fargo.
North Dakota; it was the famous Gorman Incident, in which a pilot fought
a "duel of death" with a UFO.

The pilot was George F. Gorman, a twenty-five-year-old second lieutenant
in the North Dakota Air National Guard.

It was eight-thirty in the evening and Gorman was coming into Fargo from
a cross-country flight. He flew around Fargo for a while and about nine
o'clock decided to land. He called the control tower for landing
instructions and was told that a Piper Cub was in the area. He saw the
Cub below him. All of a sudden what appeared to be the taillight of

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

another airplane passed him on his right. He called the tower and
complained but they assured him that no other aircraft except the Cub
were in the area. Gorman could still see the light so he decided to find
out what it was. He pushed the F-51 over into a turn and cut in toward
the light. He could plainly see the Cub outlined against the city lights
below, but he could see no outline of a body near the mysterious light.
He gave the ’51 more power and closed to within a 1,000 yards, close
enough to estimate that the light was 6 to 8 inches in diameter, was
sharply outlined, and was blinking on and off. Suddenly the light became
steady as it apparently put on power; it pulled into a sharp left bank
and made a pass at the tower. The light zoomed up with the F-51 in hot
pursuit. At 7,000 feet it made a turn. Gorman followed and tried to cut
inside the light's turn to get closer to it but he couldn't do it. The
light made another turn, and this time the ’51 closed on a collision
course. The UFO appeared to try to ram the ’51, and Gorman had to dive
to get out of the way. The UFO passed over the ’51's canopy with only a
few feet to spare. Again both the F-51 and the object turned and closed
on each other head on, and again the pilot had to dive out to prevent a
collision. All of a sudden the light began to climb and disappeared.

"I had the distinct impression that its maneuvers were controlled by
thought or reason," Gorman later told ATIC investigators.

Four other observers at Fargo partially corroborated his story, an
oculist, Dr. A. D. Cannon, the Cub's pilot, and his passenger, Einar
Neilson. They saw a light "moving fast," but did not witness all the
maneuvers that Gorman reported. Two CAA employees on the ground saw a
light move over the field once.

Project Sign investigators rushed to Fargo. They had wired ahead to
ground the plane. They wanted to check it over before it flew again.
When they arrived, only a matter of hours after the incident, they went
over the airplane, from the prop spinner to the rudder trim tab, with a
Geiger counter. A chart in the official report shows where every Geiger
counter reading was taken. For comparison they took readings on a
similar airplane that hadn't been flown for several days. Gorman's
airplane was more radioactive. They rushed around, got sworn statements
from the tower operators and oculist, and flew back to Dayton.

In the file on the Gorman Incident I found an old memo reporting the
meeting that was held upon the ATIC team's return from Fargo. The memo
concluded that some weird things were taking place.

The historians of the UFO agree. Donald Keyhoe, a retired Marine Corps
major and a professional writer, author of *The Flying Saucers Are Real*
and *Flying Saucers from Outer Space*, needles the Air Force about

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

the Gorman Incident, pointing out how, after feebly hinting that the
light could have been a lighted weather balloon, they dropped it like a
hot UFO. Some person by the name of Wilkins, in an equally authoritative
book, says that the Gorman Incident "stumped" the Air Force. Other
assorted historians point out that normally the UFO's are peaceful,
Gorman and Mantell just got too inquisitive, "they" just weren't ready
to be observed closely. If the Air Force hadn't slapped down the
security lid, these writers might not have reached this conclusion.
There have been other and more lurid "duels of death."

On June 21, 1952, at 10:58 P.M., a Ground Observer Corps spotter
reported that a slow-moving craft was nearing the AEC's Oak Ridge
Laboratory, an area so secret that it is prohibited to aircraft. The
spotter called the light into his filter center and the filter center
relayed the message to the ground control intercept radar. They had a
target. But before they could do more than confirm the GOC spotter's
report, the target faded from the radarscope.

An F-47 aircraft on combat air patrol in the area was vectored in
visually, spotted a light, and closed on it. They "fought" from 10,000
to 27,000 feet, and several times the object made what seemed to be
ramming attacks. The light was described as white, 6 to 8 inches in
diameter, and blinking until it put on power. The pilot could see no
silhouette around the light. The similarity to the Fargo case was
striking.

On the night of December 10, 1952, near another atomic installation, the
Hanford plant in Washington, the pilot and radar observer of a
patrolling F-94 spotted a light while flying at 26,000 feet. The crew
called their ground control station and were told that no planes were
known to be in the area. They closed on the object and saw a large,
round, white "thing" with a dim reddish light coming from two "windows."
They lost visual contact, but got a radar lock-on. They reported that
when they attempted to close on it again it would reverse direction and
dive away. Several times the plane altered course itself because
collision seemed imminent.

In each of these instances, as well as in the case narrated next, the
sources of the stories were trained airmen with excellent reputations.
They were sincerely baffled by what they had seen. They had no
conceivable motive for falsifying or "dressing up" their reports.

The other dogfight occurred September 24, 1952, between a Navy pilot of
a TBM and a light over Cuba.

The pilot had just finished making some practice passes for night
fighters when he spotted an orange light to the east of his plane. He
checked on aircraft in the area, learned that the object was
unidentified.

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

and started after it. Here is his report, written immediately after he
landed:

As it \[the light\] approached the city from the east it started a left
turn. I started to intercept. During the first part of the chase the
closest I got to the light was 8 to 10 miles. At this time it appeared
to be as large as an SNJ and had a greenish tail that looked to be five
to six times as long as the light's diameter. This tail was seen several
times in the next 10 minutes in periods of from 5 to 30 seconds each. As
I reached 10,000 feet it appeared to be at 15,000 feet and in a left
turn. It took 40 degrees of bank to keep the nose of my plane on the
light. At this time I estimated the light to be in a 10-to-15-mile
orbit.

At 12,000 feet I stopped climbing, but the light was still climbing
faster than I was. I then reversed my turn from left to right and the
light also reversed. As I was not gaining distance, I held a steady
course south trying to estimate a perpendicular between the light and
myself. The light was moving north, so I turned north. As I turned, the
light appeared to move west, then south over the base. I again tried to
intercept but the light appeared to climb rapidly at a 60-degree angle.
It climbed to 35,000 feet, then started a rapid descent.

Prior to this, while the light was still at approximately 15,000 feet, I
deliberately placed it between the moon and myself three times to try to
identify a solid body. I and my two crewmen all had a good view of the
light as it passed the moon. We could see no solid body. We considered
the fact that it might be an aerologist's balloon, but we did not see a
silhouette. Also, we would have rapidly caught up with and passed a
balloon.

During its descent, the light appeared to slow down at about 10,000
feet, at which time I made three runs on it. Two were on a 90-degree
collision course, and the light traveled at tremendous speed across my
bow. On the third run I was so close that the light blanked out the
airfield below me. Suddenly it started a dive and I followed, losing it
at 1,500 feet.

In *this* incident the UFO *was* a balloon.

The following night a lighted balloon was sent up and the pilot was
ordered up to compare his experiences. He duplicated his
dogfight—illusions and all. The Navy furnished us with a long analysis
of the affair, explaining how the pilot had been fooled.

In the case involving the ground observer and the F-47 near the atomic
installation, we plotted the winds and calculated that a lighted balloon
was right at the spot where the pilot encountered the light.

In the other instance, the "white object with two windows," we found
that a skyhook balloon had been plotted at the exact site of the
"battle."

Gorman fought a lighted balloon too. An analysis of the sighting by the
Air Weather Service sent to ATIC in a letter dated January 24, 1949,
proved it. The radioactive F-51 was decontaminated by a memo from a
Wright Field laboratory explaining that a recently flown airplane will
be

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

more radioactive than one that has been on the ground for several days.
An airplane at 20,000 to 30,000 feet picks up more cosmic rays than one
shielded by the earth's ever present haze.

Why can't experienced pilots recognize a balloon when they see one? If
they are flying at night, odd things can happen to their vision. There
is the problem of vertigo as well as disorientation brought on by flying
without points of reference. Night fighters have told dozens of stories
of being fooled by lights.

One night during World War II we had just dumped a load of bombs on a
target when a "night fighter" started to make a pass at us. Everyone in
the cockpit saw the fighter's red-hot exhaust stack as he bore down on
us. I cut loose with six caliber-.50 machine guns. Fortunately I missed
the "night fighter"—if I'd have shot it I'd have fouled up the
astronomers but good because the "night fighter" was Venus.

While the people on Project Sign were pondering over Lieutenant Gorman's
dogfight with the UFO—at the time they weren't even considering the
balloon angle—the Top Secret Estimate of the Situation was working its
way up into the higher echelons of the Air Force. It got to the late
General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, then Chief of Staff, before it was batted
back down. The general wouldn't buy interplanetary vehicles. The report
lacked proof. A group from ATIC went to the Pentagon to bolster their
position but had no luck, the Chief of Staff just couldn't be convinced.

The estimate died a quick death. Some months later it was completely
declassified and relegated to the incinerator. A few copies, one of
which I saw, were kept as mementos of the golden days of the UFO's. The
top Air Force command's refusal to buy the interplanetary theory didn't
have any immediate effect upon the morale of Project Sign because the
reports were getting better.

A belated report that is more of a collectors' item than a good UFO
sighting came into ATIC in the fall of 1948. It was from Moscow.
Someone, I could never find out exactly who, reported a huge
"smudge-like" object in the sky.

Then radar came into the picture. For months the anti-saucer factions
had been pointing their fingers at the lack of radar reports, saying,
"If they exist, why don't they show up on radarscopes?" When they showed
up on radarscopes, the UFO won some converts.

On October 15 an F-61, a World War II "Black Widow" night fighter. was
on patrol over Japan when it picked up an unidentified target on its
radar. The target was flying between 5,000 and 6,000 feet and traveling
about 200 miles per hour. When the F-61 tried to intercept it would get
to within 12,000 feet of the UFO only to have it accelerate to an
estimated

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 1,200 miles per
hour, leaving the F-61 far behind before slowing down again. The F-61
crew made six attempts to close on the UFO. On one pass, the crew said,
they did get close enough to see its silhouette. It was 20 to 30 feet
long and looked "like a rifle bullet."

Toward the end of November a wire came into Project Sign from Germany.
It was the first report where a UFO was seen and simultaneously picked
up on radar. This type of report, the first of many to come, is one of
the better types of UFO reports. The wire said:

<span class="small">At 2200 hours, local time, 23 November 1948, Capt.
—— saw an object in the air directly east of this base. It was at an
unknown altitude. It looked like a reddish star and was moving in a
southerly direction across Munich, turning slightly to the southwest
then the southeast. The speed could have been between 200 to 600 mph,
the actual speed could not be estimated, not knowing the height. Capt.
—— called base operations and they called the radar station. Radar
reported that they had seen nothing on their scope but would check
again. Radar then called operations to report that they did have a
target at 27,000 feet, some 30 miles south of Munich, traveling at 900
mph. Capt. —— reported that the object that he saw was now in that area.
A few minutes later radar called again to say that the target had
climbed to 50,000 feet, and was circling 40 miles south of
Munich.</span>

Capt. —— is an experienced pilot now flying F-80's and is considered to
be completely reliable. The sighting was verified by Capt. ——, also an
F-80 pilot.

The possibility that this was a balloon was checked but the answer from
Air Weather Service was "not a balloon." No aircraft were in the area.
Nothing we know of, except possibly experimental aircraft, which are not
in Germany, can climb 23,000 feet in a matter of minutes and travel 900
miles per hour.

By the end of 1948, Project Sign had received several hundred UFO
reports. Of these, 167 had been saved as good reports. About three dozen
were "Unknown." Even though the UFO reports were getting better and more
numerous, the enthusiasm over the interplanetary idea was cooling off.
The same people who had fought to go to Godman AFB to talk to Colonel
Hix and his UFO observers in January now had to be prodded when a
sighting needed investigating. More and more work was being pushed off
onto the other investigative organization that was helping ATIC. The
kickback on the Top Secret Estimate of the Situation was beginning to
dampen a lot of enthusiasms. It was definitely a bear market for UFO's.

A bull market was on the way, however. Early 1949 was to bring "little
lights" and green fireballs.

The "little lights" were UFO's, but the green fireballs were real.
