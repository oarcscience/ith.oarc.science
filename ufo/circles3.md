           George Hill goes  down  on  the farm and discovers that corn circles
           are grist to a media mill, whether  messages  in  Sumerian,  natural
           phenomena or simply  hoaxes  .   In  spite  of  the  giant  graffiti
           mockingly imprinted this week on a cornfield just under their noses,
           the research team  seeking  to  crack the mystery of corn circles at
           Westbury Hill in Wiltshire mean to  continue  their  vigil until the
           crop is harvested in two or three weeks' time.

           The standing corn  is  the  writing-paper  on  which   some  little-
           understood influence inscribes,  with uncanny precision, signs which
           seem to grow more numerous and more  complex every year.   With five
           low-light video cameras  trained  day  and  night  on  the  ripening
           cornfields which stretch  away  to  the  horizon from their vantage-
           point on the chalk ramparts of the  prehistoric  Bratton  Fort,  the
           team hopes to catch the moment of formation of one of the circles.

           The scene at Bratton Fort on Wednesday, on the morning  the  hoaxers
           had been at  work,  did  little  to  promote  the credibility of the
           circles as a  genuine scientific  phenomenon.  Down  below  was  the
           evidence of the  work  of  a  party  of buffoons to damage  somebody
           else's property and  livelihood,  while  high  on the escarpment the
           angry and excited figure of Colin Andrews, one of the leaders of the
           project, was letting himself be drawn  by bands of the international
           media into dropping hints which will not help workers  in  the field
           to gain respectable backers for future research.

           An atmosphere of  silly-season  gaiety  hung over the encampment. It
           will be harder than ever now to wrest  the  subject from the mystics
           who prefer supernatural to natural explanations, and  the cynics who
           are satisfied that  everything  can  be  explained  on  the basis of
           bucolic humour or press circulation-battles.  Because  the  story is
           all about ripening corn, it breaks every year just  at the time when
           serious news tends  to  be afflicted by its usual summer drought. As
           Mr Andrews spoke of ``an airborne consciousness'', which he declared
           could not inappropriately  be  described  as  ``supernatural'',  the
           representative of the Today newspaper stood at his  shoulder  with a
           proprietorial smile.

           For those who  have  been  so  merrily making hay out of the corn in
           recent weeks, any turn in the tale, whether hoax or otherwise, can

                                          Page 1





           be turned to  account  except one: a natural explanation. A solution
           to the mystery would spoil the fun  and they would be thrown back on
           the Loch Ness monster. So successful has the drive  to mystification
           been, that a  spokesman  for the Meteorological Office yesterday was
           still taking the  classic attitude  of  conservative  science  to  a
           puzzle with overtones  of  the  occult,  and  dismissing  the  whole
           phenomenon as ``a glorified hoax''.

           In spite of  Wednesday's  prank,  and  earlier  jollities  like  the
           appearance of the message ``WEARENOTALONE''  on a Hampshire hillside
           in 1983, and last year's report of rings at an Essex  village called
           Littley Green (Littley  Green  Men:  geddit?), there can be no doubt
           that many circles are not hoaxes.  If  the 400 rings which have been
           reported this year are all man-made, then the sun must  have touched
           an alarmingly large number of industrious humourists.

           Many are in  remote  spots  where  the chances of publicity would be
           slight. Similar circles have been  reported  in many other countries
           where there has  been  no ballyhoo to encourage pranksters,  and  as
           long ago as  1936,  1918,  and  even 1678.   ``It is usually easy to
           distinguish a natural circle from  a  man-made one by looking at the
           way the stalks have been pressed down,'' says Paul  Fuller,the joint
           author of Crop Circles a Mystery Solved, to be published next month.

           ``If you visit  a  fresh  one,  you  can see how the crops have been
           pressed down in a spiral or circular  pattern,  sometimes  so gently
           that they have not even been flattened, sometimes pressed  so firmly
           into the soil that they leave a mark in it. The traces left by human
           intervention are quite different.''

           But there are  aspects  to  the  circles  which  make  them tempting
           subjects for science-fiction speculation.  Witnesses  who  have been
           nearby when they form frequently speak of strange lights and buzzing
           noises, or sensations similar to those associated with strong fields
           of static electricity.

           Tests with instruments  have  sometimes  confirmed   that   electric
           phenomena are involved.    The  growing  number  of  circles  may be
           partly explicable by changes in agricultural  practice,  but  it  is
           impossible to account for the eerily systematic patterns  of  recent
           examples.  Fancy and   superstition   have   ranged  exuberantly  in
           proposing explanations for the phenomenon.

           Claims that the cause involves flying  saucers,  fungal  infections,
           ley-lines, giant hailstones,  rutting  stags  or  mass-movements  of
           hedgehogs have been  suggested,  and  gleefully perpetuated by those
           who thrive on mystification.

           This year, the bouillabaisse of red  herrings has been enriched by a
           suggestion that the  signs  are  a  warning  of ecological  disaster
           written in 3,000-year-old  Sumerian  script although it has not been
           explained why an entity which has  not yet discovered the ABC should
           be supposed to have any up to date information about other events on
           earth.

           The mystifiers are less happy with the evidence of  the small number
           of witnesses, including  some  impeccably  sober  citizens, who have
           actually observed the  formation   of   circles.   Their   testimony
           threatens to spoil the fun. One of them is Melvyn Bell, a Wiltshire

                                          Page 2





           labourer, who saw  a circle in 1983, long before the story was taken
           up by the tabloids.   ``It didn't seem a matter of great interest to
           me at the time,'' he says. ``I was  riding  on the old Ridgeway near
           Lavington at about eight in the evening one day in  August.  About a
           quarter of a mile away I saw a small cloud of dust above a cornfield
           it looked like  one of those spinning clouds of debris you sometimes
           see outside a supermarket. I was looking  down  the hill towards it,
           higher up than  the  top  of the cloud. It was all  over  in  a  few
           seconds. It laid  out  a  circle about ten yards wide in the corn. I
           heard no buzzing noises.''

           Of all explanations,  the  whirlwind   solution   is  the  one  that
           commentators drawn to  occult  answers  dislike  most.  Mr.  Andrews
           mentions it briefly  and  dismissively  in  his  own  book, Circular
           Evidence, written jointly with Pat Delgado and published last year.

           Supernaturalists have suggested that  Mr  Bell's  evidence should be
           discounted because he  is  an  employee  of Dr. Terence  Meaden,  an
           academic specialising in  research into atmospheric processes, whose
           book The Circles Effect and Its Mysteries,  also published last year
           (there must be  a supernatural explanation behind  this  exponential
           growth in the number of books on the subject).

           Dr. Meaden is  the  first  writer  to  put  forward  a  theory which
           explains most of the characteristics  of  the  circles on a basis of
           current scientific knowledge.  In  the  process,   he  goes  far  to
           providing a rational  explanation  for many of the UFO reports which
           have puzzled researchers  for  decades.   Drawing   partly   on  the
           extensive records gathered  by  Mr  Andrews and his  colleagues,  he
           shows that circles  tend  to  appear  in very specific conditions of
           weather and topography.

           ``I would say there is no mystery  about  the  basic  process,''  he
           says. ``The primary thing is a vortex formed on the  lee  side  of a
           hill in very still atmospheric conditions. If a mass of air near the
           ground becomes electrically  charged, as it can be by friction where
           a dry crop and dust have been stirred  by  the  wind  all  day, very
           complex processes might develop, and produce the buzzing and glowing
           that have been described.''

           In their familiar  form,  whirlwinds happen only in  daylight,  when
           warm air creates  upcurrents  which  spin  as they rise. But where a
           layer of cool air lies above a warm  layer, parts of the upper layer
           can fall away, and as they sink, spiral formations  like smoke-rings
           may form.   These  spinning  masses,  some  larger than others, some
           hitting the ground  quite hard, and  others  scarcely  brushing  it,
           might well be the most credible explanation for many of the detailed
           characteristics of the  circles,  including the delicate  concentric
           forms sometimes seen.

           It is more difficult to understand how they could produce treble and
           quintuple patterns of  rings, and harder still to see how they could
           lead to the complex angular spurs and key-patterns photographed this
           year.   ``Imagine a round clock falling  to  the ground,'' Dr Meaden
           says. ``If it  falls gently, it may leave a plain  round  impression
           behind. If it  falls  so  hard  that  it  smashes, then parts of the
           mechanism might shoot out this way  or that. Further vortices inside
           the main vortex might fly out as it disintegrates.  I  think many of
           these patterns are genuine, and offer clues to the internal

                                          Page 3





           structure of these  objects.''    But not even Dr Meaden can offer a
           clear explanation for the apparent  tendency of the patterns to grow
           more complex year  by  year. If that trend continues,  a  degree  of
           mystery will continue  to  cling  to  the circles, and it may not be
           long before it seems worthwhile for  us to brush up on our Sumerian.

           Crop Circles; Letter From Mr Ralph Noyes

           Sir,
              I read  with  interest  your report on the reappearance  of  crop
           circles (July 16).  Hoaxing  is  undoubtedly  taking  place  in some
           cases. We in  the Centre for Crop  Circle  Studies  are  cooperating
           closely with the  Wiltshire police in the hope of  eliminating  this
           nuisance, which is  not  only troublesome to farmers but muddies the
           scientific record.

              The event in the field near Alton  Barnes  which occurred on July
           1-2 (there has since been a second formation in the  same field) was
           seen within hours  by  members  of  CCCS.   It will by now have lost
           much of its  delicate texturing  as  a  result  of  sight-seeing  by
           members of the  public.  But  in its pristine state  it  showed  the
           hallmarks of a  genuine  occurrence,  particularly  in  the  complex
           layering of the grain where the main  shaft of the formation crosses
           the central elements of a ring and circle.   We do  not  believe  it
           could have been a hoax. Mr. and Mrs. Carson, who farm the land, have
           our full support in repudiating the suggestion of trickery.
                        Yours faithfully,  RALPH NOYES
                        (Honorary Secretary, Centre for Crop Circle Studies),
                        9 Oakley Street, SW3.  July 16.

                          Tokyo scientist rustles up corn circle
               Yoshi-Hiko Ohtsuki By Nick Nuttall, Technology Correspondent

           A JAPANESE scientist   who   has   been  enthralled  by  the  annual
           appearance of crop circles in Britain  has created the phenomenon in
           his laboratory.  The shapes, identical to those which started to re-
           appear last week, were made without the assistance of UFOs, farmers'
           lads, rutting deer, frenzied hedgehogs or any of  the  other  exotic
           theories which have sprung up around the phenomenon.

           Yoshi-Hiko Ohtsuki used a machine which he developed to produce ball
           lightning.  The professor  of  physics  at Waseda university, Tokyo,
           has thus helped to confirm theories  proposed  last  year by Terence
           Meaden, former associate   professor   of   physics   at   Dalhousie
           university in Halifax,  Canada,  and  founder  of  the Tornado Storm
           Research Organisation at Oxford polytechnic.

           Dr. Meaden suggested,  to  gales  of  derision  by  lovers  of  more
           outlandish explanations, that  the topography and  climate  of  such
           counties as Wiltshire and Hampshire triggered the formation of mini-
           whirlwinds.   As they  broke  down  over  fields,  he  suggested,  a
           doughnut-shaped eddy within the column swept downwards, swirling the
           crop.

                                          Page 4





           Dr. Meaden said  yesterday that Professor Ohtsuki, who first visited
           Britain two years ago to examine the  phenomenon,  had told him in a
           letter that he fired mini-whirlwinds over plates of  fine  aluminium
           powder in his ball-lightning machine to replicate the swirls.

           The findings have  been  lent  further  weight  by  another Japanese
           scientist, Tokio Kikuchi of Kochi  university,  who  has developed a
           mathematical model based on Dr Meaden's theory which  has  been shot
           on video.   It  also  creates more complex shapes, similiar to those
           that have appeared in recent years.

           Supporters of more exotic theories  had said that a scientific basis
           for corn circles is defied by these complicated configurations.  Dr.
           Meaden believes that  the final answer to the circles'  complexities
           might be found  in  the  appearance  of  sun  spots  which  lead  to
           electromagnetic changes in the Earth's atmosphere and crust.

           If so, the number of complicated  corn  circles  may  fall  over the
           coming years.   Solar activity is believed to be  on  the  point  of
           declining from a  200  -  year  peak.      (c) Times Newspapers Ltd.

           LONDON'S most famous occult bookshop,  Waktins,  is  having no truck
           with the Southampton hoaxsters who confessed to newspapers yesterday
           that they were responsible for the mystery of the corn circles.

           ``The newspapers are full of lies,'' said an angry spokesman for the
           shop, which specialises  in  books on magic, astrology  and  psychic
           phenomena. The enigma  remains,  insists the shop. So, too, will its
           window display, erected  last  week,   of  books  on  crop  circles,
           explaining the phenomenon by reference to aliens from  outer  space,
           energy currents and  other  causes  far  more plausible than two men
           with a ball of string, an old baseball  cap and 4 ft wooden plinths.
