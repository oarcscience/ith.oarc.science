### CHAPTER VII

### FLYING SAUCER CONVENTION IN HOLLYWOOD

During those last days I was at Lockheed I thought often of Neptune's
cryptic words: "The road will open, Orfeo; walk it as you will." And
later when he said: "I smile upon you, Orfeo, for your greatly enhanced
numbers."

Then his last prophetic words, "Strength and courage will be given to
the millions who will rise and meet the great battles ahead with only a
faint hope on their side for victory."

It was true, I thought; the road was beginning to open. New
understandings and an ever increasing awareness were coming to me as
time pissed. Also, as more and more people learned of my experiences
many began to phone, write, or visit at our home, wishing to know more
about the space visitors. We continued the regular weekly meetings at
the Los Feliz Club House, but as the crowds increased, the Club House
was no longer large enough to accommodate everyone. It was then that Max
Miller, President of *Flying Saucers International*, an organization
devoted to the study of flying saucer phenomena, and Jerome Criswell,
the well-known columnist and television Man of Prophecy, suggested that
we rent the music room in the famous

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

old Hollywood Hotel for our weekly meetings. Thus we had been meeting
there for several months every Sunday evening or afternoon. Opinions
were exchanged and lectures on saucer phenomena were presented to
enthusiastic audiences.

Paradoxically enough, as the general public's interest in the saucers
increased, the press, radio, television and other news media suddenly
and inexplicably dropped flying saucers from the news. Even the
second-rate science fiction writers banished the word from their lexicon
of horrors. Thus the public was left to grope for itself. And
surprisingly enough the way was thus cleared for those individuals who
had experienced actual contacts with the extraterrestrials to work
freely without obstruction of erroneous "slanting" by official
reporting.

Gerald Heard, Frank Scully and Donald Keyhoe were familiar names among
persons interested in the saucers. These men, along with *Fate* magazine
and Ray Palmer, had been making every effort to awaken the public to the
awesome fact that our world might well be under observation by beings
from another planet. But now several unknown men were speaking up and
declaring that they had actually had contact with the saucers and space
visitors. Among these were George Van Tassel, Truman Betherum, George
Adamski, George Williamson and Alfred Bailey. Those few newspapers which
ran stories on these men did so with the tongue-in-cheek slant.

Sunday afternoons I was speaking to groups at the

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hollywood Hotel. I
knew that my audience waited patiently for clear, concise accounts of my
experiences with extra-terrestrials. But they were often disappointed.
Frequently when I stepped upon the platform to speak a strange
transition came over me. It was as though another personality
overshadowed me; someone who knew all of the answers. But the answers
were not in my familiar English or Italian, but in an unfamiliar,
half-remembered tongue. I would struggle to translate the ideas into
English and end up by failing to be clear and direct. Thus with the
understanding of the universe almost within my grasp, I was often
helpless to reveal any part of it.

Nevertheless, even with my many failures to be concise and direct, the
meetings gained momentum with increasing numbers in the audience.

It was then that Max Miller conceived the idea of a Flying Saucer
Convention. It sounded like a tremendous idea to me. With the help of
several other persons we enthusiastically began to formulate plans. It
was decided that we should hold the convention at the Hollywood Hotel
where there was plenty of room in the lobby to accommodate a large
audience.

Various exhibits of saucer photographs, space ship models, books,
magazines and pamphlets on the saucers were set up around the lobby and
many circulars were mailed out announcing the event. Also invitations to
speak at the convention were mailed to all persons who had been most
helpful in revealing and

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

disseminating information about the saucers and extra-terrestrials.

But response to the invitations was very poor. Less than a week before
the convention was to open it appeared that none of the speakers whom we
had counted upon would be present. Max was greatly worried. "It looks
like we're sunk, Orfeo," he exclaimed dejectedly. "This thing is going
to be the prize flop of any and all conventions." But as I looked at
him, the conviction was suddenly strong in my mind that everything would
come off well. I replied: "Don't worry, Max. It's going to come off much
better than we ever even dreamed it would."

My prediction proved entirely correct. Every one of the speakers whom we
had invited showed up for the convention, and some others besides. Among
the invited speakers were Frank Scully, Arthur Luis Joquel II, George
Van Tassel, George Adamski, Truman Betherum, John Otto from Chicago,
Harding Walsh and a mysterious Dr. "X" who spoke long and eloquently on
the saucers. He left immediately after speaking and no one ever knew who
he really was or where he came from, although many inquired; for he had
some startling things to say.

Almost to a man the speakers said they had received an irresistible urge
to attend on Friday (two days before the opening of the convention).
Could it be that the space visitors had been at work in their own subtle
way?

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

At any rate the convention was a tremendous success. For three days and
night the crowds overflowed the Hollywood Hotel out onto the lawns and
adjacent Hollywood Boulevard. In fact the response was so tremendous
that on the second morning I requested Max to stop all publicity on the
convention.

Some of the larger Los Angeles newspapers covered the convention. But
all news stories were of the usual tongue-in-cheek type. A few of the
smaller, more rabid papers tried to "expose" it as nothing but a
promotional "money-making" scheme.

The convention was a hectic one. I was busy night and day and carried on
practically without sleep. When I wasn't speaking, people were
surrounding me and bombarding me with endless questions. Many were
skeptical and did not hesitate to be belligerent about it. But all
during my ten months of speaking at the weekly meetings and the three
nerve-wracking days of the convention, I never once lost my temper. A
power beyond my own consciousness or control carried me through. In
trying moments of heckling or confusion an upsurgence of peace and calm
would pick me up and give me strength equal to the occasion.

However, on the last night of the convention, the power that was
sustaining me suddenly failed and I lost my temper for the first time. A
lone woman who had been especially persistent in seeking me out and
cornering me to revile me and hurl quotes of scripture at me was
responsible for the

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

outburst. She knew I was wrong and she was right. And she had books,
diagrams and bible verses to prove it. When at last I literally blew my
top she joyfully picked up her data and departed shouting that my temper
proved I was an agent of the devil. Within an hour I lost my temper
several times again.

The most trying experience of the convention occurred when a large group
of materialists were literally "giving me the works" in a stubborn,
derisive effort to "get at the bottom of my story" and ferret out
obvious flaws from a "common-sense" viewpoint.

Sincere, open-minded, honest persons who are willing to investigate the
advent of space visitors never resort to such sneering interrogations.
They ask honest, sincere questions on points they do not fully
understand. But they have an honest desire to know, not to discredit, to
sneer and to disparage.

This particular group had their minds set upon "exposing" me. Their
methods, although entirely on a mental plane, would make the medieval
inquisitions seem innocuous. Like little demons they parroted elementary
physics and could see practical, intelligent action only behind the Iron
Curtain. They knew I was a cheap publicity seeker who did not hesitate
to lie about space visitors or anything else to further my own ends. No
words of explanation could possibly prove anything to them they did not
wish to believe.

I had undergone just as bitter and insinuating

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

criticism before, but I was exceptionally tired that last night. I felt
almost as though I were melting away before their venomous onslaught,
collapsing at the seams, as it were, and suddenly I felt very, very
human and down to earth. I was on the verge of exploding in anger again
when a kind of veil was drawn over my conscious mind. The gesticulating
figures before me faded to babbling, inconsequential shadows.

As they continued their violent attacks, my thoughts drifted calmly back
to a scene of a few weeks before. I was attending a convention of
science-fiction writers at the Hotel Commodore in Los Angeles. Since my
experiences with the extra-terrestrials, I have become interested in the
field of science-fiction, for I have found that many scientific truths
are adumbrated, or delineated, in science-fiction before ever they
become realities of our world.

Many well known writers in the science-fiction field were present. When
I came in they were holding open discussions of trends in the
science-fiction field, the various new markets, etc.

One of the audience asked: "Why have all science-fiction writers
suddenly stopped writing or even mentioning flying saucers?"

A speaker replied authoritatively that the subject had become taboo with
them.

Another member of the audience demanded to know why this was so since
the saucers had actually given such an impetus to the science-fiction
field.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

The speaker had no adequate answer for that one, but lamely explained
that the saucers were "old stuff" now.

I was becoming impatient with the proceedings and was on the point of
leaving when the guest speaker of the evening was announced. He was Mr.
Gerald Heard, the well-known science-fiction writer and author of IS
ANOTHER WORLD WATCHING?

Mr. Heard spoke with great eloquence and a deep, penetrating philosophy.
He berated the writers for turning out material of an inferior grade and
warned that the public would not continue to "stomach it", much less to
buy it. Many of them squirmed uncomfortably in their seats.

As he neared the end of his stimulating and thought-provoking talk, his
eyes met mine where I was seated near the back with two companions. I
noticed that he seemed tired and shaken.

As our eyes met and held, a kind of mutual understanding passed between
us. It was as though vortices of light opened between us in ever
widening circles. Dimly, I could hear him terminating his speech with
these words: "There is one in this room tonight—I do not know who he is,
but he's going to upset the whole applecart." He paused, then his voice
reverberated as he added: "He is the Awakener—he has not yet appeared,
but he well may be here in this very room tonight. Thank you."

And the mystic wheels between us set in motion

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

by the controlled magnetic vortices slowly receded and vanished.

I looked about the room at the audience, but they were no longer
listening to him. Some were whispering and laughing among themselves.

As I looked about that busy room I thought that it was small wonder that
the concoctors of science-fiction horror diets had declared the saucers
"taboo". Far too much beautiful reality was on the side of the saucers.
Harmony and beauty are much too tame for the horror boys. They have
joined forces with the materialists, subversives and egoists to fight
the "flying saucer sensationalists" down at every turn.

But the joke is on them, for reality has slipped quietly past them and
established new frontiers of its own. The science-fictioneers were
induced by subtle forces to ignore flying saucers as were many other
materialistic sources of information. During the welcome lull the actual
flying saucer phenomena and the extra-terrestrials were left to the
inexperienced but honest handling of rank amateurs. At first these men
were inept and inarticulate, but they are finding their voices and their
numbers are rapidly increasing. The space visitors had actually only
cleared the atmosphere for them. Had the professional spinners of
horror-fiction stuck to the theme of flying saucers, the true contacts
should never have been able to perform their missions.
