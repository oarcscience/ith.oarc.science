### CHAPTER I

### THE DISK FROM ANOTHER WORLD

Friday, May 23, 1952, was an ordinary day in Burbank, California insofar
as I was concerned. I got up at my usual time, worked around the yard
for a few hours and later stopped in at the Drive-In snack bar. After
several cups of coffee and an exchange of good-natured banter with some
of the customers, I left and went to my job at the Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation plant.

Things went along well enough during the earlier part of the evening,
but about 11 o'clock, I began to feel ill. An odd prickling sensation
was running through my hands and arms and up into the back of my neck. I
had a slight heart palpitation and my nerves were on edge. I felt just
as I always do before a bad electrical storm. As the familiar symptoms
increased I went outside expecting to find heavy threatening clouds, but
the night was exceptionally clear and the stars were bright.

Puzzled, I went to work wondering what was wrong with me. By 12:30 A.M.,
when the quitting whistle sounded, I was so exhausted I could scarcely
stand; it would be a relief to get home and into bed. I took my car from
the Lockheed parking lot and headed southeast on Victory Boulevard
toward home.

I became increasingly conscious of nervous tension

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

as I drove. I sensed a force of some kind about me. Never in all of my
similar illnesses had I experienced such peculiar symptoms. There was no
pain, yet I felt as though I might die at any moment. The prickling
sensation had increased and spread to my arms, legs and up into my
scalp.

Frightened, I wondered if an old illness was returning upon me. Was I
going to be confined to my bed again with the terrible debility and
excruciating pain of the "constitutional inadequacy" of my schoolboy
days? The dread symptoms were certainly there.

At Alameda Boulevard I stopped for a traffic signal. It was then I
noticed that my eyesight was glazed and the sounds of traffic were oddly
muffled and far-away as though my hearing was also affected. I decided
that I had better stop at one of the all-night cafes and have a cup of
coffee. But at the thought all of my alarming symptoms increased. I
forgot the idea of a cup of coffee. My sole and overwhelming desire was
to get home as fast as I could.

I continued on Victory Boulevard toward home. I had the illusion that
the night was growing brighter as though enveloped in a soft golden
haze. Directly ahead and slightly above my line of vision I saw a
faintly red-glowing oval-shaped object. At first it was so dim I had to
stare at it to be certain it was really there. But gradually it
increased in brilliance. It was about five times as large as the red
portion of a traffic light. Nervously I rubbed

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

my eyes; something was wrong with my vision! But the thing remained
there; not sharp and clearly defined, but fuzzily luminous, definitely
oval-shaped and deep red in color.

I continued on Riverside Drive directly toward the object, but it
appeared to be receding from me so that I remained relatively the same
distance from it. As it was almost one o'clock in the morning there was
little traffic on the road. Apparently no one else had noticed the
object as I saw no cars stopped to investigate. I wondered if I also
would have missed it above the glare of the headlights if my strange
symptoms had not drawn my eyes to it.

I drove across the bridge over the Los Angeles River with the object
still in view. Just the other side of the bridge, to the right of the
highway, is a lonely, deserted stretch of road called Forest Lawn Drive.
The object stopped and hovered over the intersection. As I drew near, it
gained in brilliance and its red color grew deeper and more glowing.
Simultaneously, the physical symptoms I was experiencing became more
acute. I was aware of a tingling sensation of pain and numbness in my
arms and legs that reminded me of contact with an electrical current.

Now the disk veered sharply to the right off the highway and began
moving slowly along Forest Lawn Drive. For the first time it occurred to
me that the fantastic thing could be one of those flying saucers I had
read about. I turned my car onto Forest Lawn Drive and followed the
object.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

About a mile further along the disk swerved to the right, away from the
road, and hung motionless over an unfenced field some distance below the
road level. I drove off the pavement about thirty feet to the edge of
the declivity. From there the glowing red disk was directly in front of
me and only a short distance away. As I watched it in bewilderment it
pulsated violently; then shot off into the sky at a 30- or 40-degree
angle and at very great speed. High in the sky to the west it
decelerated abruptly, hung for a moment; then accelerated and
disappeared like a meteor.

But just before the glowing red orb vanished, two smaller objects came
from it. These objects were definitely circular in shape and of a soft,
fluorescent green color. They streaked down directly in front of my car
and hovered only a few feet away. I judged each to be about three feet
in diameter. Hanging silently in the air like irridescent bubbles their
green light fluctuated rhythmically in intensity.

Then, apparently coming from between those two eerie balls of green
fire, I heard a masculine voice in strong, well-modulated tones and
speaking perfect English.

Because of the nervous tension I was under at that moment, amounting
almost to a state of shock, it is impossible for me to give a verbatim
account of the conversation which followed. The invisible speaker
obviously was endeavoring to choose words and phrases which I could
understand, but there

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

were several things which even now are not clear to me. I can only make
a poor approximation of the gist of his words.

I do, however, remember the first words spoken which were: "Don't be
afraid, Orfeo, we are friends!" Then the voice requested that I get out
of my car and "Come out here." Mechanically, I pushed open the car door
and got out. I didn't feel fear, but I was so weak and shaky that I
could scarcely stand. I leaned against the front fender of my car and
looked at the twin pulsating circular objects hovering a short distance
in front of me.

The glowing disks created a soft illumination, but I could see no person
anywhere. I remember vaguely that the voice spoke again calling me by my
full name in words of greeting. It further stated that the small green
disks were instruments of transmission and reception comparable to
nothing developed on earth. Then the voice added that through the disks
I was in direct communication with friends from another world.

There was a pause and I dimly remember thinking that I should say
something, but I was stunned into utter silence. I could only stare in
fascination at those fantastic balls of green fire and wonder if I had
lost my mind.

When the voice spoke again I heard these startling words: "Do you
remember your eighteen balloons and the mold cultures that you lost in
the skies back in New Jersey, Orfeo?" I was astounded to hear the
strange voice recalling

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

an incident out of the past which had happened so long ago that I had
almost forgotten it. "Yes . . . . yes sir, I do!"

"Do you also remember the strange, wingless craft that appeared to be
observing your activities?"

Suddenly the entire scene carne back to me crystal clear in memory. I
remember Mabel, my wife, my father-in-law and our friends and neighbors
with me as we stared at that strange, disk-shaped object in the sky. I
recalled how the object had appeared to follow the balloons bearing my
precious cultures of *Aspergillus Clavatus* mold. I had been quite an
experimenter in those days. It was then it dawned upon me that the
fluorescent disks were similar in shape and behaved in the same erratic
manner as had that mysterious craft back in New Jersey. The only
difference was that I had seen the craft in daylight when it glistened
like metal whereas the disks glowed in the darkness.

"You do remember us, Orfeo," the golden voice stated. "We were observing
your efforts that day as we have watched you since then."

All traces of fear left me at these words, but I could not help but
wonder what it all meant. Suddenly I realized that I was feeling very
thirsty.

As though in response to my thought, the voice said: "Drink from the
crystal cup you will find on the fender of your car, Orfeo."

Astonished at his words, I glanced down and saw a kind of goblet on the
car fender. It glistened in the soft light. Hesitantly I lifted it to my
lips and

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

tasted the drink. It was the most delicious beverage I had ever tasted.
I drained the cup. Even as I was drinking a feeling of strength and
well-being swept over me and all of my unpleasant symptoms vanished.

"Oh thank you, sir," I said as I placed the empty cup back on the fender
of my car only to see it disappear.

At that moment another incredible phenomenon began to occur. The twin
disks were spaced about three feet apart. Now the area between them
began to glow with a soft green light which gradually formed into a
luminous three-dimensional screen as the disks themselves faded
perceptibly.

Within the luminous screen there appeared images of the heads and
shoulders of two persons, as though in a cinema close-up. One was the
image of a man and the other of a woman. I say man and woman only
because their outlines and features were generally similar to men and
women. But those two figures struck me as being the ultimate of
perfection. There was an impressive nobility about them; their eyes were
larger and much more expressive and they emanated a seeming radiance
that filled me with wonder. Even more confusing was the troubling
thought somewhere in the back of my mind that they were oddly familiar.
Strangely enough, the projected images of the two beings appeared to be
observing me. For they looked directly at me and smiled; then their eyes
looked about as though taking in the entire scene.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

I had the uncomfortable feeling as they studied me that they knew every
thought in my mind; everything I'd ever done and a vast amount about me
that I didn't even know myself. Intuitively, I sensed that I stood in a
kind of spiritual nakedness before them. Also, I seemed to be in
telepathic communication with them, for thoughts, understandings and new
comprehensions that would have required hours of conversation to
transmit, flashed through my consciousness.

Before those two incredible Beings I felt that I was only a shadow of
the shining reality I sensed them to be. It is difficult to express my
feelings in words, for my understanding of them was gained primarily
through intuitive perception.

After several moments the two figures faded and the luminous screen
vanished. Again the two disks flamed into brilliant green fire.

Trembling violently from weakness and cold perspiration, I was on the
point of blacking out when I heard the voice again. It was more kindly
than ever as it said something about my being understandably confused;
but it assured me I would understand everything that had happened later
on. Also, I remember these words: "The road will open, Orfeo."

I didn't understand. Instead the thought flashed through my mind: "Why
have they contacted me; a humble aircraft worker—a nobody?"

The voice replied: "We see the individuals of Earth as each one really
is, Orfeo, and not as perceived

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

by the limited senses of man. The people of your planet have been under
observation for centuries, but have only recently been re-surveyed.
Every point of progress in your society is registered with us. We know
you as you do not know yourselves. Every man, woman and child is
recorded in vital statistics by means of our recording crystal disks.
Each of you is infinitely more important to us than to your fellow
Earthlings because you are not aware of the true mystery of your being.

"From among you we singled out three individuals who, from the
standpoint of our higher vibrational perception, are best fitted for
establishing contact. All three are simple, humble and presently unknown
persons. Of the other two, one is living in Rome and the other in India.
But for our first contact with the people of Earth, Orfeo, we have
chosen you.

"We feel a deep sense of brotherhood toward Earth's inhabitants because
of an ancient kinship of our planet with Earth. In you we can look far
back in time and recreate certain aspects of our former world. With deep
compassion and understanding we have watched your world going through
its 'growing pains'. We ask that you look upon us simply as older
brothers."

The voice continued, speaking rather rapidly. It stated that they were
well aware that the flying saucers had been treated humorously by most
people—as it was meant they should be. In this way they wanted the
people of Earth to become only

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

gradually aware of them and grow accustomed to the idea of space
visitors. It was best that we receive them lightly at first for the sake
of our own stability!

The voice stated that the disks were powered and controlled by tapping
into universal magnetic forces; thus their activated molecules received
and converted energy inherent in all the universe. It further explained
that the complexities of the apparently simple structure of their disks
were so great that to an Earthling a saucer would be considered as
having "synthetic brains", although each one is to a degree under the
remote control of a Mother Ship. Also, most of the saucers, as well as
the space craft of other planetary evolutions, are of a circular shape
and vary in size from a few inches to hundreds of feet in diameter.

A disk, the voice continued, is able not only to relay whatever is
transmitted to it from a Mother Ship, but also it records precisely all
visual, auditory and telepathic impressions that come within the scope
of the disk. These impressions are relayed to the Mother Ship where they
are permanently recorded upon what Earthlings would popularly term
"synthetic crystal brains". Thus for centuries had been recorded a
detailed account of Earth's civilization and the spiritual evolution of
individual persons.

The voice also stated that in addition to the remotely controlled
saucers there also existed space ships, some of which had been seen by
Earthlings. It was further explained that the Etheric entities in

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

reality had no need of space-craft of any type and when they were
employed by them it was only for purposes of material manifestation to
men.

I distinctly remember the voice making some such statement as this:
"Interplanetary ships and saucers of various material densities can
approximate the speed of light. This seems impossible to you only
because of a natural principle which has not yet been discovered by your
scientists. Also, the Speed of Light is the Speed of Truth. This
statement is presently unintelligible to Earth's peoples, but is a basic
cosmic axiom.

"Approaching the speed of light, the Time dimension, as known upon
Earth, becomes non-existent; hence in this comparatively new dimension
there are incredibly rapid means of space travel which are beyond man's
comprehension. Also, within the Records of Light are to be found a
complete history of Earth and of every entity which has incarnated upon
it.

Many of the saucers—of highly attenuated densities of matter—were
invisible to Earthly eyes and could only be detected by radar. Also, any
of the saucers could be rendered invisible at any time, or could be
disintegrated by either explosion or implosion. Thus Earthlings had seen
some apparently burst in a blue or white flash while others seemed
simply to vanish in the air.

I remember wondering about Captain Mantell and several others who
believed they had contacted the saucers. In reply to my thought I heard
these

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

words: "Captain Mantell was not pursuing the planet Venus. He was
endeavoring to overtake and capture one of the remotely controlled
disks. His death was absolutely unavoidable!

"We wish to tell Earth's people that visitors from other planets
occasionally visit Earth's dense, heavy, gaseous atmosphere. All are of
kindly intent and none will harm man. All intelligences capable of space
travel can read thoughts and see emotions. Man believes himself
civilized, but often his thoughts are barbaric and his emotions lethal.
We do not say this as criticism, but state it only as fact. Thus it is
best to approach all planetary visitors with friendly, welcoming
thoughts!"

As I listened to his words I wondered why these incredible beings hadn't
landed several space ships at one of our large airports and thus
convinced the world simply and quickly of their reality.

In answer, I heard these words: "That would be the way of the entities
of your Earth, Orfeo, but it is not our way. Primarily because we
function in dimensions unknown to man and hence interpret all things
differently. Also, because there are planetary and cosmic laws as
implacable as the natural laws of Earth.

"Cosmic law actively prevents one planet from interfering with the
evolution of any other planet. In other words, Orfeo, Earth must work
out its own destiny! We will do everything in our power to aid the
people of Earth, but we are definitely and greatly limited by cosmic
law. It is because the life

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

evolution in its present stage of material advancement upon Earth is
endangered that we have made our re-appearance in the atmosphere of your
planet. The danger is far greater than Earth's people realize. The
'enemy' prepares in vast numbers and in secret."

For a moment the voice was still and then it said gently: "Among the
countless other worlds in the cosmos, Orfeo, the children of Earth are
as babes, although many of them believe they are close to the ultimate
of knowledge. Among the worlds of the universe are many types of
spiritual and physical evolutions. Each form of intelligent life adapts
itself to the physical conditions prevalent upon its home planet. Most
of these evolutions exist in more highly attenuated forms of matter than
upon Earth. But the majority are rather similar to man in appearance.
There is a definite reason for this being so. In reality, we are Earth's
older brothers and thus we will aid Earth's people insofar as they,
through free will, will permit us to do so."

As I listened to that kind, gentle voice I began to feel a warm, glowing
wave of love enfold me; so powerful that it seemed as a tangible soft,
golden light. For a wonderful moment I felt infinitely greater, finer
and stronger than I knew myself to be. It was as though momentarily I
had transcended mortality and was somehow related to these superior
beings.

"We'll contact you again, Orfeo," the voice said. "But for now, friend,
it is goodnight."

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

The two shimmering green disks faded almost out; then I heard a low hum
as they flamed brilliantly into glowing green fire and shot up into the
sky in the direction taken earlier by the larger red disk. In an
incredibly short time they too had vanished, leaving me standing alone
by my car.

Bewilderment, incredulity, shock and stark fear flooded over me—sudden
conviction that I had lost my mind and gone raving mad. What I had
witnessed, I felt, just couldn't have happened.

I raised my numbed hand and it was trembling violently. I saw by my
watch that it was almost two o'clock in the morning. I climbed shakily
into my car and kicked the starter. Panic was mounting in me. I twisted
the steering wheel, gunned the engine and made a sharp, fast U turn to
get back onto the road. The tires screamed and the car lurched.

I wanted to get home quickly. I wanted to get back to the world of sane
reality. I wanted someone to assure me I wasn't going mad.

I drove with only a single objective in my mind—to get home! When
finally I made the turn onto Glendale Boulevard and saw the lights of my
apartment I breathed a heavy sigh of relief; no place had ever looked so
good to me!

I left the car in the driveway and ran into the house. My wife was
waiting up, worried and anxious because I was so late.

"Orfeo, what's the matter? What's wrong? You're white as a sheet!"

I stood staring at her, unable to speak.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

She came to me and grasped my hand. "Orfeo, you're sick! I'm going to
call a doctor."

I put my arms around her. I wanted only to feel her close to me and for
the moment to try not to think of what I had been through.

She pleaded with me to tell her what had happened.

"Tomorrow—maybe tomorrow, Mae, I can tell you. . . ."

Finally we got to bed, but it was almost dawn before I drifted into a
troubled half sleep.
