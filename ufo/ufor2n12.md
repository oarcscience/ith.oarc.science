          UFO ROUNDUP
     Volume 2, Number 12
     March 23, 1997

     ARIZONA REPORTS KEEP
     POURING IN

          Researchers have been flooded with reports in
     the wake of last week's big UFO flap in Arizona.
          People claiming to have seen glowing orange
     spheres and triangular UFOs over Phoenix, Tempe,
     Prescott, Glendale and Tucson the evening of
     March 13, 1997 number in the thousands.
          On Monday, March 17, 1997, Channel 10 in
     Phoenix aired a videotape of a large cylindrical
     UFO with 8 lights.
          In Tucson, eyewitnesses reported four bright
     lights coming from the northwest and heading
     southeast.  (See the Prescott, Arizona Daily
     Courier for March 14, 1997  "UFO Sightings in
     PV, Other Areas.")
          In Glendale (population 96,988), orange globes
     hovered over a suburban neighborhood for two hours,
     from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m.  People were "looking up at
     what they said were orange balls of light.  They were
     very scared...In fact, my 80-year-old father-in-law was
     shouting on the phone at one point.  My wife and I
     did what we could to calm him down and let him
     know what we had tried to tell him about UFOs over
     the years," Billy Dee of Wisconsin reported.
          On Tuesday, March 18, the Arizona Republic ran
     a story on the flap.  According to reporter Susie
     Steckner, the "first call came from former police
     officers who spotted" the UFOs "near Paulden, north
     of Prescott, in Yavapai County."
          "The bright orange-red lights formed the shape of
     a boomerang...with a larger grouping in the lead, followed
     by a single light."
          Shortly after 8 p.m., calls came flooding in from
     Prescott, Prescott Valley, Dewey, Chris Valley,
     Glendale and Phoenix.
          "Tim MacDonald, 11, was leaving his Cub Scout
     meeting in Phoenix when he saw the bizarre object.
     'It looked like a Stealth bomber,' he said, 'It was in a
     triangle shape and had three lights.  It was moving very
     slowly.  It was there for two or three minutes...When it
     disappeared, I thought it was a UFO.'" (See the Arizona
     Republic for March 18, 1997.)
          During its 5 p.m. newcast on March 17, Channel 12
     in Phoenix stated that the glowing orange spheres seen
     March 13 over the Gila River Indian Reservation south of
     the city were "military flares."  The announcer reportedly
     said, "The strange lights over Phoenix were explained
     as an anti-aircraft experiment in a military area 50 miles
     (80 kilometers) south of Phoenix."
          Lt. Col. Mike Hauser, USAF, a spokesman for Luke
     Air Force Base, told the Arizona Republic: "Everybody is
     telling us we have UFOs stashed all over the Air Force.
     I'm not taking issue with what people saw (but) lots of
     things can make lights."
          On Wednesday, March 19, videographer Tom King
     and a group of ufologists went to the state park at South
     Mountain, just south of Phoenix, hoping to catch more
     UFOs on tape.  But park rangers ordered the group off
     the mountain at 9:30 p.m.
          "To our surprise, we were hustled out of the park
     early," King reported.  "The park usually closes at 11 p.m.
     We were told to leave at 9:24.  The park rangers were
     storming up the peak and announced over the loudspeaker,
     'The park is closed.  Leave now.  The park is closed.
     Leave while you can.'"  (Many thanks to Bill Hamilton,

     Wilson, Jr. for this story.)

     GUNSHIPS CHASE THREE UFOs
     OVER WEST VIRGINIA

          On Tuesday, March 11, 1997, at 6:30 p.m., which
     was the second night of the UFO flap in Phoenix, three
     orange spheres appeared over the south bank of the
     Kanawha River, in the South Hills section of
     Charleston, West Virginia.
          Patricia J. Blake and her nine-year-old daughter
     were on Oakwood Road in South Hills when they
     sighted the objects.  "The first light was coming down
     towards the woods vertically," Mrs. Blake said, "It was
     very orange and had a long trail behind it.  Two other
     lights of the same description were also coming down,
     also with tails behind them.  The first one was now in
     the middle and seemed to slow down at one point."
          Mrs. Blake said the three UFOs were arrayed
     like this:
                                  0          0
                                        0

          "Then all three appeared to stay in this position
     for a few minutes, the larger moving rather slowly to
     our right.  When we first saw them, they were maybe
     45 degrees above the horizon (and then) came down
     to a much lower angle, I would say 25 degrees."
          Mrs. Blake estimated that the UFOs hovered over
     a wooded area south of Route 61 and west of Route 119.
     "The lights darted to the west, somewhat southwest,
     hovered at the second site for 8 to 10 minutes," she
     added.  "It was still daylight and the sky was nearly
     cloudless."  The UFOs then sped away.
          At 6:45 p.m., four C-130 Air National Guard planes
     flew across the Kanawha River, heading southwest in
     the same direction as the orange UFOs.  Mrs. Blake
     said she believes the planes came from Yeager Field
     airport, northeast of Charleston.  (Email Interview)

     ORANGE GLOBES REPORTED
     OVER QUEBEC AND VERMONT

          In addition to Arizona and West Virginia, "orange
     sphere" UFOs were also seen over Quebec.  Since
     Friday, March 14, the ufological group CEIPI has
     interviewed 24 eyewitnesses.
          Most of the sightings took place over Breckenridge,
     a small town on the north shore of the Ottawa River
     near Aylemer (population 25,724), just west of
     Canada's capital city, Ottawa.
          On Friday, March 14, shortly before 8 p.m., a
     glowing orange light was seen over Breckenridge.
     Shortly after 8, a man in Gatineau, Quebec
     (population 73,479) eight miles (12 kilometers)
     north of Ottawa, saw "a definite orange light."
          At 8:45 p.m., another man "saw the same thing
     but a little more yellow" over the Parc de la Gatineau,
     along the Ottawa River.
          On Saturday, March 15, at 10:15 p.m., a total of
     10 eyewitnesses told CEIPI that they saw "an unknown
     object" hovering close to the ice on the Ottawa River.
     The UFO had six arrays of white light and appeared
     in the same place in the Parc de la Gatineau off
     Route 148 as the previous night.
          On Monday, March 17, at 9:50 p.m., another ten
     witnesses saw "a very brilliant and strong" aerial
     light glowing behind the mountain at Breckenridge.
          According to Jean Casault of CEIPI, the Aylmer
     police reportedly told his group that the lights were
     "military flares" being lit on the firing range at CFB
     Connaught, near Ottawa.
          Meanwhile, below the border, radio buff Tony
     O'Neill switched on his BC860XLT 100-channel
     12-band Uniden Bearcat scanner.  At 7:20 p.m. on
     Monday, March 17, he picked up an intriguing
     exchange between Air Traffic Controllers (ATCs)
     and six jetliner pilots.
          The pilots were talking to the ATCs in Albany,
     New York and Burlington, Vermont, he said.  "One
     pilot radioed 'A bright light approached us, went
     vertical and dropped into the horizon.'"
          The pilot asked both ATCs to confirm his
     position, and they did--the jetliner was 30 miles
     (48 kilometers) east of Burlington or 150 miles
     (240 kilometers) northeast of Albany.  That puts
     the UFO over the forest area just south of
     Hardwick, Vermont (population 1,476)
          Six pilots discussed the sighting with the
     towers, O'Neill said, describing the UFO as
     having "fire coming out of the back and left or
     made a contrail."  Controllers asked the pilots
     if they would be willing to file a report.  Some said
     yes and were given the phone number of the Federal
     Aviation Administration (FAA) center in Nashua, New
     Hampshire. (Email Interview)

     of CEIPI for this report.)

     ANOTHER MYSTERY OBJECT
     SEEN IN FLORIDA KEYS

          At 6:30 a.m. on January 24, 1997, Sherry Howell
     and her husband left Key West to drive back to their
     home in Florida.  As they drove north on Route 1, a
     thunderstorm crowded the western horizon over the
     Gulf of Mexico.  At 7:30 a.m., just north of Marathon
     (population 1,500), "we were crossing a bridge when
     I saw the first one," Sherry reported.  "Then I saw what
     seemed to be a cloud...it developed into an object like
     the first only much lower on the horizon and much
     closer to the highway."
          While her husband drove, Sherry snapped some
     photos of both objects.  "The (second) object was no
     more than a half-mile from us.  The other was much
     higher in the sky and so it was more difficult to estimate
     distance.  Both objects were silvery gray."
          She estimated that the more distant UFO was "the
     size of a man's thumbnail at arm's length" while the
     closer one was "larger than a bus."
          "The front of the larget object had a darker gray
     front," she said, "It reminded me of the front of a
     microwave (oven).  Neither object moved while we were
     observing them."
          Mrs. Howell sent her roll of film to a developer.
     But the finished photos showed only the dark overcast
     sky--not the objects.  (Email Interview)

     FAST FLYBY ON FRANCE'S
     MEDITERRANEAN SHORE

          On Monday, March 17, 1997, at 9:04 a.m., "a bright
     streak" appeared in the sky over Montpellier, a seaport
     city on the Mediterranean midway between Nimes and
     Narbonne.  The object was seen by commuters driving
     to work and by mothers dropping off their children at
     school.  Witnesses described the UFO as "moving
     very fast from the northeast to the southeast."
          The UFOs semi-circular flight path was confirmed
     by the pilot of an Air France jetliner, who spotted the
     object at 30,000 feet over Montpellier.  "The phenomenon
     disappeared very quickly."  (Many thanks to SOS OVNI
     for this report.)

     UFO ZAPS TEENAGED GIRL IN
     PUNTA ARENAS, CHILE

          On or about February 25, 1997, teenager Maria
     Amparo Galvez was walking home from school in her
     hometown of Puerto Arenas, at the southern tip of
     Chile, when a glowing UFO suddenly appeared.
          According to Carlos Munoz, an investigator for
     Agrupacion de Investigaciones Ovniologicas (AION),
     Maria ran away and "was hit in the back by many
     small balls of light--flashes that peppered her back."
          Maria remembers nothing else of the strange
     incident except "waking up at another location
     four hours later."
          On February 24, 1997, an odd "ring-shaped OVNI"
     (Spanish acronym for UFO) was seen hovering above
     Lago (Lake) de Rapel in the Andes.
          The following day, February 25, 1997, Fuerzas
     Aereas de Chile's (Chilean Air Force's) crack aerobatics
     team, Los Halcones, was performing at an air show in
     Pucon when a UFO slipped into the restricted airspace.
          "The object was ring-like," AION reported, "It looked
     like a ring of smoke but very bright.  It turned on its axis
     and left the area very slowly (about 60 mph), moving
     east.  The object was filmed by two different witnesses,
     one of them the air traffic controller at Pucon."

     TWO SAUCERS SIGHTED NEAR
     AIRPORT IN LIMA, PERU

          On Monday, March 17, 1997, at 11 p.m., people
     living in Boca Negra, a suburban town at the north end
     of Aeropuerto Internacional Jorge Chavez spotted two
     disc-shaped UFOs beyond the airport's runway, near
     the beach.  Boca Negra is 20 kilometers (12 miles)
     north of Lima, the capital of Peru.
          According to China's Xinhua news agency, about
     a dozen witnesses described the UFOs as "saucer-
     shaped craft...with multicolored lights flashing
     intermittently."  The UFOs hovered for several minutes
     and then flew away to the northeast.  (Many thanks
     to Erik S. for this story.)

     NEW SIGHTING IN NORTHEAST
     CORNER OF BRAZIL

          On February 22, 1997, at 4:58 p.m., Messias de
     Oliveira was walking through the Bairro de Nordexte
     in Aracagi, a town in Brazil's northeastern state of
     Joao Pessoa.  Aracagi is close to Guarabira, which
     has been the focus of a UFO flap that began on
     April 4, 1996.
          As she walked by the Compostagem bus stop,
     she saw "an oval-shaped light, extremely bright,
     rising into the air, giving the appearance of being
     hidden behind the bus station.  It gave off whitish
     smoke."  At first, Messias "thought it was a teardrop
     shaped fireworks display before realizing it was far
     stranger than that."  She thought, "It's going to fall,"
     but "the object continued to rise noiselessly into the
     air."  She was reportedly "shaken by the experience."

     T.A.S.K. AND THE SAUCER OF
     MADISON COUNTY

          On Wednesday, March 12, 1997, at 8 p.m., a huge
     "flying disc" estimated to be 100 feet (30 meters) in
     diameter, appeared over Mount Sterling, Ohio
     (population 1,623), a small town in Madison County
     22 miles (35 kilometers) southwest of Columbus.
          The saucer was seen by two couples, one at each
     end of the town.  They estimated that it floated 50
     feet (15 meters) off the ground and flew from east to
     west.  "It was over the town for four and a half minutes.
     There was no noise.  The departure path was to the
     west at a very quick speed."
          According to investigator Jim Donohue of Equinox,
     the eyewitnesses included a woman age 35, a girl
     age 14, a man in his early 70s and another man in
     his middle 50s.
          The same night, at 9:15 p.m., Ron Schaffner of
     Tri-States Advocates of Scientific Knowledge
     (T.A.S.K.) received a call from a farmer in Aberdeen
     (population 1,600), a town on the Ohio River.  The
     man reported "a formation of three to five lights"
     and the lights "appeared orange or white-red in color.
     Three lights in a row, then two on top."
          The same farm was visited by a smilar array of
     UFO lights the night of October 16, 1996.  The UFOs
     appeared near the zenith of the barn on Flaugher
     Hill Road in Aberdeen.  Three T.A.S.K. members,
     Kenneth Young, Terry Enders and Dale Farmer,
     interviewed the farmer back in October.  The group's
     investigation in Aberdeen continues.  (Many thanks
     to Kenneth Young, T.A.S.K. public relations
     director, for this story.)

     From the UFO Files...

     WHERE IS JOAN WILLIAMS?

          One of the strangest cases in the annals of the
     Lake Michigan Triangle took place 32 years ago
     this week.
          "She was Joan Williams, 39, a Chicago Heights
     (Illinois) schoolteacher who owned a Cessna 170B,
     N2522C.  She left Wings Airport, Chicago, at noon
     on a Saturday morning, March 20, 1965, carrying
     fuel sufficient for four hours, 30 minutes.  She was
     not on a flight plan.  She has not been seen since."
          "For some reason the case stimulated the
     interest of the Chicago newspapers.  It stayed in the
     headlines for weeks as officials searched vainly for
     some evidence of what happened.  Virtually everyone
     Miss Williams knew was contacted.  Her bank records
     and personal life were investigated thoroughly on the
     chance that the disappearance was intentional.  The
     lake (Lake Michigan) was combed for some scrap of
     wreckage that might solve the mystery."
          But the search was in vain.  Joan Williams's
     Cessna vanished from the FAA radar scope while
     the plane was airborne southwest of Ludington,
     Michigan.  She has not been seen since.
