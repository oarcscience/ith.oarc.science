       The Sociocultural Genesis of the Flying Saucer
           (SWEDENBORG HYBRID ORNITHOPTER OF 1714)
                  by Wesley R. Smith, Ph.D.

   Among the most badly handled, most interesting, most
distorted, and most eclectic of aerospace history subjects
is the origin of the use of the circular, elliptical and
annular wing planforms (shapes) in aircraft design.
   A quick review of the writer's memory and library reveal
that more than 50 aircraft have been designed, and/or built,
using an ellipse or circle as a wing configuration. However,
this listing is by no means a complete survey, only a brief
overview of what can be located at hand. In fact, there is
an entire U.S. Patent subclass (Class 244, Aeronautics;
Subclass 21.2 Airplane, circular) dealing with aircraft
using a circular wing planform. Likewise, a number of
lighter-than-air or hybrid designs have appeared in the
course of aeronautical history which also use the disc shape
as a basis for the gas envelope.
   What is undoubtedly the first recorded circular aircraft
was the product of the fertile imagination of an 18th
Century Swedish scientist, philosopher and noted theologian
named Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772).
   Born in Stockholm on Jan. 29, 1688, he was the second
son of Jesper Swedenberg. The family surname was transformed
to "Swedenborg" after being enobled by the King of Sweden in
1719 and following Jesper's appointment as the Bishop of
Skara. From 1710 to 1714 Emanuel Swedenborg traveled
extensively throughout Europe following his education at
Uppsala University; visiting England, Holland, France and
Germany. An avid student of astronomy and mathematics, he is
known to have met with John Flamsteed and Edmund Halley.
While he is known to have studied the works of Isaac Newton,
there is no evidence to support the contention that
Swedenborg ever knew him. Nevertheless, it was during this
period in his life that Swedenborg developed many ideas
which were as far ranging as a method to calculate longitude
based on the position of the moon, to plans for a submarine
and a practical design for an aeroplane.
   On Sept. 8, 1714, Swedenborg first wrote of his idea for
an aircraft to his brother-in-law, Erik Benzelius. This was
later followed by a complete written description which
appeared in the fourth edition of Sweden's first scientific
journal, _Daedulus Hyperboreus_, founded by Swedenborg in
the same year (1716). During this time, Charles XII of
Sweden also appointed Swedenborg as Assessor Extraordinary
at the Royal College of Mines, which enabled him to have
significant impact on Sweden's metal-mining for the next 30
years, during which he was elevated to the position of
Assessor. Moreover, his work is of great historical
significance, for _Daedulus Hyperboreus_ contains the first
detailed technical description of a flying machine of any
type.
   Fortunately, the Stifts-och Landesbibliotek at Linkoping
(codex 14a, 1714) has Swedenborg's original manuscripts
which include a sketch of Swedenborg's "Flying Saucer." The
design is oval in shape; however, circular, square and
rectangular planforms are also suggested in the 1716 text.
The dimensions [*] of Swedenborg's aircraft are given as:
32' x 24' (603.2 sq') for an oval, 28' diameter (615.75 sq')
for a circle, 25' x 25' (625 sq') for a square, and 20' x
30' (600 sq') for a rectangular surface. In all cases the
central thesis of the Swedenborg ornithopter comprises of a
central pilot's station measuring 6' wide, 4' long and 2'
deep. Suggested materials for the pilot's basket include
cork, leather and birch bark; nevertheless, both the main
wing and secondary flapping wings were to be covered with
sailcloth.
   On both sides of the basket area are a pair of flapping
wings operated by the would-be pilot. These are described as
having a length of 5' and a chord of 1.5' (7.5 sq' each). A
coiled spring was also to be attached to the spars of the
flapping wings to enable the pilot to operate the wings with
greater ease.
   Furthermore, like a design suggested by Da Vinci, the
flapping wings were intended to function as valves with
hinges at the center of the chord, folding on the up-stroke
and opening on the down-stroke. With aid of what he refers
to as "the power of the wind," Swedenborg believed that the
muscular weakness of the pilot would be more than
compensated for by this system, and that by being able to
alter the incidence angle of the flapping wings, they would
also provide sufficient thrust for horizontal flight. While
not entirely complete, there is at least a partial divorce
of the lift and thrust components of flight, as the flapping
wings are clearly not intended as the primary means of
aerodynamic lift. A complete separation of these two systems
would not come for another 85 years when Sir George Cayley
designed his first fixed-Ying aircraft in 1799.
   The oval wing of Swedenborg's machine is comprised of a
wooden framework with eight lateral ribs. Both lateral and
longitudinal camber are employed, the curvature being
maintained by four beams spaced in pairs at right angles to
each other. After carefully balancing the craft to ascertain
its center of gravity, Svedenborg suggested that a vertical
beam measuring about 8' in length be attached to the bottom
of the pilot's basket. At the bottom end, a weight of 1
lispund (18.75 lbs) was to be attached to ensure pendulum
stability.To support the entire machine, and presumably
prevent the central beam from piercing the bottom of the
basket, four diagonal beams were apparently attached to the
sides of the pilot's basket. Swedenborg states that it
"would do no harm" to attach wheels to the ends of the
quadruped struts, but he does not specifically indicate they
were necessary.
   Alas, Swedenborg's flying saucer was never to be built.
He did, however, wisely suggest that the aircraft first be
tested as a ballasted glider, and that it be launched from a
high place. Looking across the chasm of 280 years we can see
the practical, as well as the impractical, aspects of his
design. His work apparently influenced no one and is all but
forgotten by most aerospace historians; but since his day, a
number of successful circular planform aircraft have been
built and flown. Although the idea was not to be taken up
again for many years, it is worth noting that there were at
least a dozen circular, elliptical or annular shaped
aircraft designed and/or built in the United States and
Canada prior to the First World War. Among them, Dr. Bell's
Ring Rite of 1908, Ringert Jongewaard's flying disc of the
1880s, Robert B. Taylor's 1842 design for a convertiplane,
George Francis Myers' 1904 annular quadruplane, and the
interesting McCormick-Romme "Umbrella Plane" tested at
Cicero Field near Chicago from 1912 to 1914.
   Last year a disc-shaped airship was displayed at
Washington, D.C., by a team of Russians for the first time,
so it would seem that the idea is far from permanently
disappearing from the polymorphic annals of aerospace
despite the high aerodynamic drag penalty of circular
planforms, particularly at transonic speeds.
   The flying saucer, like the "flying house" stories of
the late 19th Century and the "Great Airship Flap" of
1896-1897, is based on historical fact which has evolved
into distorted cultural mythology. Yes, there are flying
saucers, and I for one, am open minded enough to admit that
it is entirely possible for life to have arisen on a planet
orbiting a distant star. But of all the flying saucers that
can be positively identified, they are definitely the
products of imaginative human beings, and among those humans
is one by the name of Emanuel Swedenborg, an 18th Century
man who designed the progenitor of what has become a 20th
Century icon.

                            NOTES

* According to _The Prehistory of Flight_, p. 233, footnote
  5, Sweedenborg's unit of measurement, the ell, is about
  2' (24n). However, _Webster's Third New International
  Dictionary_, p. 736, states that an ell is 2.25' (27").
  Based on the latter, the overall dimensions and areas
  would be as follows: Oval, 36' * 27', 763.4 sq'; circle,
  31.5' dia, 779.3 sq'; square, 28.125', 791 sq';
  rectangle, 22.5' * 33.75', 791 sq'. Additionally, the
  dimensions of the pilot's basket would be 6.75' * 4.5' *
  2.25'. The wings would measure 5.625' * 1.6875', 9.5 sq'
  (ea), and the rod for the pendulum weight would be 9' in
  length.
