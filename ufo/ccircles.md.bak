    I have been following the various postings on Crop Circles and thought people
    in this group might find an interview with Colin Andrews (founder of Circles
    Phenomenon Research, an internatiional organization dedicated to the
    investigation of the crop formations) by Monte Leach, USA editor for Share
    International magazine, of interest.  This interview is excerpted from the
    July/August 1992 issue of Share International.

    THE SIGNS HAVE ARRIVED


    Interview with Colin Andrews
    by Monte Leach



            Colin Andrews is an electrical engineer and former senior officer with
    local government in West Hampshire, England.  He is founder of Circles
    Phenomenon Research, an international organization dedicated to the
    investigation of the crop formations.  His 1989 international best-selling book
    Circular Evidence, co-authored with Pat Delgado, brought widespread attention
    to the phenomenon, and has been translated into Japanese, German, Spanish, and
    Italian.  A more recent book, The Latest Evidence, was published in 1990 (see
    Share International July/August 1991). Monte Leach interviewed him.



    SI:  What is the latest update on the crop circle phenomenon?


    CA:  We have been showing evidence, arrived at by a German distillation process
    at HSC laboratory, at Stroud in Gloucestershire, that there had been a change
    in the crystalline structure of the [crop circle] plants.  This is an
    unconventional process that's worried a lot of scientists, who were concerned
    that we were travelling up the wrong road in our research.
            I disagreed, and continue to disagree.  But because it was an
    unconventional approach, we had to find a laboratory prepared and equipped to
    undertake more conventional analytical processes.  Dr W.C. Levengood, a
    biophysicist and plant expert in Michigan, took up the challenge.  He already
    has secured two major discoveries.  One is that the cells at the nodal point,
    the point at which the plants bend, about a half to one inch above ground
    level, have fractured and scarred.  That cannot occur by the trampling of feet,
    or whirlwinds, or the other processes that we hear about.  Dr Levengood is not
    able to state precisely what causes that to happen, but is suggesting that it
    is due to a rapid increase in temperature within the plant.  This fracturing
    and scarring of the cell structure supports the HSC Laboratory results.


    SI:  What was the other important finding?


    CA:  Dr Levengood planted the seeds from the cereal crops involved in this
    phenomenon (those that were involved last year) and germinated them in
    environmentally-sound conditions.  He found that the date at which the plants
    germinated was consistent with the controls, the plants outside of the crop
    circle area.  What he then found, and this is consistent with what we have been
    looking at over the years, is that the plant growth is positive.  That is to
    say, the plants, once they've germinated, grew at a very much more accelerated
    rate above ground level [than the control samples].  The root structure was
    also much more extensive and healthy below ground level, as compared with the
    control samples -- indeed many-fold healthier and more productive.  That, too,
    is a very important discovery.  The plants were taken from three sites in the
    world -- Australia, America, and Great Britain.  We're looking at a consistency
    here.  Again, comparing that with wind damage, hoaxing, and trampling by human
    feet, it isn't an effect than can be replicated.




    SI:  Will these results be published in any way?


    CA:  Yes, they will be. In fact, in a limited way, they have already been
    published recently.*


    SI:  Are there any other developments with the scientific research?


    CA:  Yes, the work of Gerald Hawkins, the respected scientist in Washington,
    DC, who has written books on the geometry of Stonehenge.




    SI:  What has he found with the crop circles?


    CA:  It's looking very exciting indeed.  Prior to the launch of Circular
    Evidence, we had an 'uncontaminated' period, a period during which -- I would
    pretty well put my life on it -- we were not receiving any hoaxes at all. Since
    the book was launched, the public became aware that something unusual was going
    on, and of course now we have a high number of claims of hoaxes and indeed
    physical hoaxes as well.
            But in the crop formations of that pre-contaminated period prior to
    1989, what Gerald Hawkins has proven is that, well beyond a chance of over 90
    per cent, we are looking at diatonic ratios within the crop circles.  And
    perhaps we're looking at ancient geometry which could relate to sound itself,
    because these are the same ratios which underlie the diatonic scale in music.
    It's an extremely significant development.  What's for sure is that I doubt if
    there is any hoaxer in the world who would begin to even know what it is we're
    talking about, let alone calculate his handiwork to compare ancient diatonic
    ratios of that kind.




    The Gulf Breeze incident


    SI:  Anything that we can look forward to in the coming months?


    CA:  Early this summer, there's going to be a surveillance operation.  It will
    be similar to what happened when I planned Operation Blackbird with the British
    Army, but it will involve no media whatsoever.  It will be confidential.  A
    site has been chosen.  It's in central-southern England, and it will be at a
    site where the ground markings have appeared regularly, and also where aerial
    phenomena are occurring regularly.
            We're interested in those two particular elements because of a major
    development which took place in Gulf Breeze, Florida, on 13 March this year.

    SI:  This is your work with Steven Greer?


    CA:  We've been working with Dr Steven Greer, a physician here in the US. He's
    now heading his own SETI project [Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence],
    and has worked out over a period of 18 months a protocol for interaction with
    an airborne object.  He took his team of 33 observers to Gulf Breeze, opposite
    the Pensacola military establishment there.
            On 13 March, his team of 33 observers established their position. Using
    powerful one million candle-watt search beams they formed a triangle of light
    in the sky.  Within seconds five white lights with orange balls on the under
    side appeared, moved across the sky and took up position at the triangle's
    apex.  They maintained this position.
            In the next stage Steven flashed the search beam at a pre-determined
    rate onto one of the objects.  Meanwhile, everything was being filmed on video
    camaras.  There were, I believe, another 20 or so members of the public
    observing this from six other locations around Gulf Breeze.  The team then
    traced a course with a beam from above the five objects down onto the beach,
    suggesting to the objects that they move along this line to ground level.  Two
    objects broke away from the five, and moved along that beam.  But they stopped,
    took up a hovering position directly over the observers there.  They maintained
    their position for quite some while, and at that point, through binoculars, all
    of them, Steven included, could see the structural detail of those objects.  At
    this point, the objects gave out two flashes of white light, and all of them,
    the two and the remaining three, just simply disappeared.
            A CBS television film crew was there on the following Tuesday filming
    something quite different.  Some of Steven's team were still in the area.  I
    don't know how they made contact with one another, but apparently they
    suggested to CBS that they should stay and that Steven's team would have a
    second try at this.  They did, and the television crew filmed two UFOs, which
    responded similarly.  Quite an extraordinary case.
            If it is as reported, we have something here of great importance.
    Steven and his team will be coming over to Britain, and carrying on that
    particular process over the fields where these markings have appeared. I have a
    very positive feeling about this, as Steven does himself.  We may well be
    entering a critical phase.


    Response to a sick molecule


    SI:  Could you talk a bit about what you believe the crop circles mean?

    CA:  We are entering a very crucial and important phase in our evolution.  The
    crop markings are only a part of a major shift in the consciousness of mankind,
    and moving us forward, probably the biggest leap forward in our evolution in
    history.
            In terms of this planet, I believe that we are looking at a single,
    living molecule.  The Gaia theory makes perfect sense to me, that we are indeed
    looking at a living planet, a living organism.  It's what the indigenous
    peoples have always tried to tell us.  They have survived only because they
    have understood how to interact with nature.  They found their place in nature.
    We are here in a material way, and are on a course to folly.  We have a limited
    time to put things right.  It's 10 seconds to midnight.  Unless we learn to
    harmonize, to interact with all living things, I'm afraid we are going to see
    the closing down of a living organism on which we rely.  This message is also
    coming from those who are working in pure science right now.  We have a big
    problem.  The planet has a big problem.  The evidence is there.
            I believe that the crop circles are graphic markings that have within
    them, in their entirety, a meaning.  That meaning, and the response to that
    visual intake, is automatic, because it's within our blueprint.  It is within
    us subconsciously to recognize them.  Many people feel this, but they are
    unable to establish where they've seen them before.
            It is, I believe, part of the change of consciousness.  There are high
    levels of energy which are being intelligently placed into position in critical
    parts of the planet.  These, if you like, are probably the chakra points, to
    give it a term, important energy points of the living organism.  They are not
    random, and they have never been random.  They are at specific points, and they
    recur at those locations.  I believe that they are occurring literally at the
    interface between this dimension of the world that we know quite a lot about
    and those other dimensions of which we know so very little.  We are beginning
    to see that we can interact in a limited way, directly with other dimensions.
            We are seeing, I think, the reaction of the brain end of the universe,
    the thinking end, which is automatically responding to a very sick molecule. If
    you were to cut your finger, the brain end of your universe, your head, would
    react subconsciously to that.  You certainly wouldn't be saying, "Send me
    haemoglobin and white corpuscles."  But the brain end automatically responds.
    If we could watch the processes going on within your framed universe, what we
    would see in a microscope is white blood corpuscles moving to that point and
    interacting.  The behavioural tendency would be the equivalent of the UFO. That
    would be the UFO response from the brain-end of the universe to this planet.
    That's the analogy.


    The manifestation to come


    SI:  In the video 'Undeniable Evidence' you say that this crop circle
    phenomenon is leading to a manifestation of some type. What do you think is
    going to happen?

    CA:  I have felt for quite some years that we are certainly going to experience
    something of great magnitude.  It is going to be very soon.  We are going to
    encounter something here which I don't think any man or woman is going to
    doubt.
            This coming few months is going to see one or two events which are
    going to shake the world.  It is going to focus our attention and the reality
    of knowing we are not the only thinking components of this living planet.  We
    are going to be stunned into accepting that we have much more to consider.


    SI:  Do you have a bottom line? Do you know what it's going to be, but hesitate
    to make it known in public?

    CA:  I do, because I still feel it is most important at this juncture, as it
    has been for the last 10 years, that this research, this effort at
    disseminating what we already know about this phenomenon, must be kept
    rational.


    SI:  You believe this event will take place soon, and will leave no doubt that
    we are not alone here. Is that the main purpose of these events?

    CA:  It is indeed.  We will be receiving assistance of new knowledge, new
    abilities, because we will be working at a different level.  We will see
    manifestations of the Fatima** type.  That is the picture that is in my mind.
    It is a very clear picture.  I see certainly a Fatima-type experience
    occurring. I believe it will be in the vicinity of Silbury Hill, Stonehenge,
    Avebury in southern England, because that's where the focus of attention is.
    There has to be a reason why this is happening right there.  Having said that,
    I believe that will be the door opener.  The whole world is going to experience
    something of tremendous importance.


    Close to a Golden Age


    SI:  What you are saying correlates in some ways with Benjamin Creme's message.

    CA:  I would like to say on the record that I have great respect for Benjamin
    Creme's work.  Indeed, I hope to meet him.  I have read a fair bit of your
    magazine, in fact.
            The thinking end, the brain end of the universe is the way I have been
    putting it in recent times.  We could easily fall out with society here because
    there is potential for great difficulty when we are talking about the thinking
    component of the universe.  That could be Jesus.  It could be God.  It could be
    extraterrestrial.  It could be high nature.  I don't feel that we have time to
    fall out over that.  We have something which has thought, something which is
    intelligently interacting with us, and providing us with proof of its
    existence.


    SI:  I believe that all of these phenomena are very much connected. I think the
    appearance of the Teacher, the crop circles, the UFOs, are all working together
    to raise the consciousness of humanity. That's my opinion.

    CA:  It's one that I share totally.  We are living in special times.  There is
    no doubt that at this time next year, the world is going to be very different.
    We are living very close to a Golden Age.  I really feel that.  But equally,
    one has to say a word of warning, that always there are equal quantities of
    blackness right alongside.  It's as easy to get it wrong as it is to get it
    right.  We have to put out that white light, to put out there positive
    thinking, with sincerity and good heart.  At the end of the day, we'll be doing
    all we possibly can for humanity.
            It is also worth bearing in mind the Hopi Indian prophecy.  We have
    reached a stage at the very end of the evolutionary path where the Hopi are
    awaiting the white man who left their land to return with the missing piece of
    a tablet on which there will be the signs.  I would suggest to you that if we
    can focus our attention on the crop circles and the interaction with the UFO,
    in the very near future we will appreciate that the signs have arrived.  As the
    Hopi prophecy shows, we are about to hold and shake the hand of the Spirit, the
    very Spirit that started us on this path.



    *Linda Moulton Howe, an award-winning documentary filmmaker and a UFO
    researcher, has helped to co-ordinate Dr Levengood's work.  Howe had these
    comments at a recent conference in San Francisco:
            "Dr Levengood has found under microscopic examination that in the
    plants that were affected, the cell pits -- the tiny holes in cells of plants
    where fluid moves back and forth, and keep the plants growing and healthy --
    have been expanded.  The only way that Dr Levengood could duplicate this cell
    pit separation was to put plants inside of a microwave for up to 30 seconds.
    He's not saying that it's microwave radiation that did it.  He's saying that
    rapid heating was the only way he could duplicate the cell pit separation in
    the plants.
            "Further, a nuclear design engineer in Tennessee has done preliminary
    work on some soil samples and has found that there were three different types
    of isotope changes that were found in the soil underneath at least two crop
    formations.  That work is now considered to be tentative.  They need many more
    soil samples from many more formations to make any kind of definitive
    scientific presentation.  But at least the preliminary findings are intriguing
    because they suggest that some kind of energy is being applied in the formation
    of these crop circles that is not understood."



    **Three children in Fatima, Portugal, reported a series of visions of the
    Virgin Mary in 1917.  The experiences culminated in October of that year in a
    manifestation which included miraculous phenomena witnessed by thousands.

               Reported to NAICCR as of 24 August 1992

    920426    Jonesboro, Georgia
    -  a "formation" of crop circles, "exactly" like those found in
    1991 in the same location, was discovered.

    920506    near Edmonton, Alberta
    -  a "space cookie" UGM was discovered in a meadow.  It is a
    perfect circle, 6 metres in diameter. Its depth varies from 5 cm
    to 31 cm.  Grass is growing straight up both inside and outside
    the circle.  No tracks were found leading to the area.  The UGM
    is not a sinkhole. 
    Source: Gordon Kijek

    920525    Limerick, Pennsylvania
    -  at least 12 "matted down" areas were found in a wheatfield north of
    Philadelphia.  Three were circles about five feet in diameter, arranged
    in a triangle.  One feature was "T-shaped".  Soil samples taken by a UFO
    investigator "showed no irregularities".  Geiger counter readings were
    also normal.  Although a hoax was suspected by the UFO investigator,
    the owner of the field believes that the UGMs were caused by lodging,
    wind and fertilizer damage, and that "It happens every year".

    920627    Raeford, North Carolina
    -  a circle of flattened grass was found in a hay field following
    a CE2 UFO sighting.  A loud noise, "like a freight train", was
    heard, and two witnesses ran to look out their front door.  A
    object "the size of a swimming pool", "like orange windows lla
    around it", was in a field about 300 feet away from their house. 
    When they went to call other witnesses, the object disappeared.

    920701    St. Adolphe, Manitoba
    -  nine "horseshoe-shaped" patches of flattened grass were found
    on either side of a brook in a Winnipeg suburb. Because of rece
    storms and heavy rainfall, lodging was thought to be the cause

    920705    Hobbema, Alberta
    -  two ovals of flattened barley were found in a field after
    unusual lights were observed descending to the ground.  The
    largest UGM has a major axis of 47 feet.  The crop is pushed away
    uniformly from the centers of the patches, but the centers are
    "clumped", like breaking waves.  Barley inside the circles is
    "white", and devoid of colour.  It was later suggested that the areas
    were due to spilled seeds and fertilizer, combined with lodging.

    920715    St. Adolphe, Manitoba
    -  a field beside a highway was discovered to have numerous patches of
    flattened crop, in irregular patterns.  The formations were discovered
    by the same person who found case 920701.  Investigation by NAICCR and
    interviews with the owner of the field established that the crop had
    been laid down by strong winds and heavy rain.  The person who
    discovered the formations was convinced that aliens created the
    flattened patches.

    920721    Friedensruh, Manitoba
    -  a farmer found a triangular area of flattened/swirled grass which
    was surrounded by an electric fence.  The dimensions were 31x27x17
    feet.  Local residents could not explain the phenomenon.  However,
    NAICCR investigators found evidence that animals had trampled the site.

    920799    Pilot Peak, California
    -  according to the Phoenix Project, a number of "landing zones" were
    discovered near the site of an alleged underground alien base.  Visits
    to the site by independent invesyigators have found only patches of
    grass trampled by deer and other animals.  Two "landing zones" were
    claimed.

    Report on Investigations of Crop Circles
    in the Area of Strathclair, Manitoba

    18 August 1992


         Following media reports about several new crop circles in
    western Manitoba, NAICCR representatives travelled to the area
    for onsite investigations.

         Five crop formations were discovered, one of which was
    easily explained as lodging.  Of the other four, three were in
    the shape of the symbol for Mars: a circle with an attached arrow. 
    Two were alongside a major highway, while the others were
    next to less-travelled farm roads.  The two near the major
    highway were apparently made on the night of 14-15 August 1992.  

         Rumours of the circles spread through the community, and
    many people went to see the formations.  By Monday, 17 August
    1992, an estimated 200 people had visited the sites.  News media
    mentioned the sites in newscasts on 17-18 August, but the
    formations did not attract the wide publicity that other, less
    impressive and explainable formations had garnered a month
    earlier.  NAICCR investigators were able to visit the sites on 18
    August 1992, after a four-hour excursion from Winnipeg.

         Wheat and soil samples were taken from all sites.  Mapping
    was done, though, because of excessive trampling of the
    formations, measurement errors of about six inches were possible. 
    Compasses were employed, but no magnetic anomalies were detected. 
    Both VHF and AM/FM radios were tested, but no interference was
    detected.  Tape recordings taken at the sites were unaffected. 
    No unusual sounds were heard, and no unusual "feelings" were
    sensed.  Insects were present in normal quantities at the sites. 
    According to residents, animals were not afraid to enter the
    areas.

         At one formation, two youths guarded the entrance and
    brandished a sign reading: "A Loonie a Look"; they charged a
    dollar to anyone wanting to enter the site. [Note: "loonie" is a slang
    term for a Canadian dollar coin.]

         At Strathclair No.4, two NAICCR investigators decided to try
    an experiment in circle creation.  They walked between the rows
    of wheat into an unaffected area and began walking around in a
    circle.  After five minutes, they had produced a circle of
    comparable size to Strathclair No.4.  The new circle was swirled
    and flattened, and examination of wheat stalks showed no breakage
    whatsoever.  The stalks were only gently bent at a height of
    about one to two inches above the ground, and did not appear to
    have been subjected to any force.  The appearance of the new
    circle was relatively "messy", but after a few minutes of "touch-
    ups", it began to look more like the "real" circle.  Suggestions
    were offered as to ways in which more even flattening could be
    produced.  Since Strathclair No.4 was created on the night of 14-
    15 August 1992, only a few days after full Moon, it was proposed
    that a hoaxer could easily have created the formation without any
    flashlights and ducked down below the level of the five-foot-high
    wheat when an occasional car passed by.

         The hoax theory is complicated by a CE1 UFO
    sighting over the field where the Ipswich formation was
    discovered.  One close witness and two other witnesses observed
    an unusual object moving over the field and then fly away on the
    night that that formation was likely created.

         On the night of 14 August, a television program about crop
    circles had been aired.  Residents of the area had recalled
    seeing the episode.  However, at least two of the formations had
    been discovered before the program was aired.  It is not thought
    that the television program had necessarily precipitated the later 
    formations.

         Wheat samples will be given to several researchers for
    testing.  As some cerealogists have claimed that seeds from
    plants inside circles grow faster/better than those from a
    control sample, double-blind tests of this theory will be
    performed.  Further investigations are continuing.

         Descriptions of the formations follow, along with a number of UFO
    reports from the same time period.

                                            Found: 1 August 1992


    A circle of flattened wheat was discovered in a field southwest
    of Strathclair.  It was 28 feet in diameter.  The wheat was
    flattened and swirled in a counterclockwise direction.  The
    circle was approximately 40 feet from a municipal road.

    Known as Strathclair No.1.

    Reported to the media on 16 August 1992.  NAICCR investigation
    was on 18 August 1992.  The site had been badly trampled by
    visitors during the interim.

                                            Found: 8 August 1992


    A flattened area of wheat in the shape of the symbol for Mars was
    discovered in a field southwest of Strathclair.  The main
    circle was 28 feet in diameter, with no detectable eccentricity. 
    The wheat was flattened and swirled in a counterclockwise
    direction.  The formation was approximately 40 feet from a
    municipal road, directly opposite a circle which had been
    discovered a week earlier. 

    In the arrow, the wheat was flattened away from the circle,
    following the lines of the arrow.  The arrow pointed away from
    the circle on a bearing of 260 degrees.  The arrow was 18.5 feet in
    length, with left and right arms of 6 and 6.5 feet in length,
    respectively.  The width of the arrow was approximately 36
    inches. The arrow pointed almost directly away from the road.  

    Known as Strathclair No.2.

    Reported to the media on 16 August 1992.  NAICCR investigation
    was on 18 August 1992.  The site had been badly trampled by

                                            Found: 15 August 1992

    A flattened area of wheat in the shape of the symbol for Mars was
    discovered in a field just east of Ipswich.  The main area
    was 26 feet in diameter along its major axis and 24.5 feet along
    its minor axis.  The wheat was flattened and swirled in a
    counterclockwise direction.  

    In the arrow, the wheat was flattened away from the circle,
    following the lines of the arrow.  The arrow pointed away from
    the main area on a bearing of 65 degrees. The arrow was 17.5 feet in
    length, with left and right arms 7.5 and 11 feet in length,
    respectively.  The width of the arrow corridor was 28 inches. 
    The arrow pointed toward a farm road, its tip being only 36 feet
    from the road.

    Known as Ipswich.

    Reported to the media on 16 August 1992.  NAICCR investigation
    was on 18 August 1992.  The site had been badly trampled by
    visitors during the interim.

    A UFO had been seen at the site on 14 August 1992.

                                            Found: 15 August 1992

    A flattened area was found in a wheat field near other crop
    circle UGMs.  It was roughly 20 feet in diameter.  Wheat was laid
    down in random clumps, and some sections had rebounded upright. 
    The area was visible from a nearby road.  Examination suggested
    the area was caused by lodging.

    Known as Strathclair No.3

    Reported to the media on 16 August 1992.  NAICCR investigation
    was on 18 August 1992.  The site had been trampled by visitors

    UFO Reports:

    Ipswich, Manitoba                       ND Case 920814.1
                                            14 August 1992
                                            2115 local time

    A woman was driving east from Shoal Lake to Strathclair when she
    saw a pair of bright yellow lights over a field to her left.  The
    lights appeared to be about 50 to 100 feet above the ground.  She
    stopped her car to get a better look, and watched as the lights
    moved in tandem, one above the other, progressing over the field
    heading west.  As it was not quite dark, she was sure that she
    could see a dark object behind the lights, with another very
    small flashing light at its "tail".  

    The witness' daughter and son-in-law were following in their own
    car, and they also saw the object before it moved out of view
    behind some trees.  The object was visible for about two minutes
    as it progressed slowly over the field.  No noise was heard.

    Reported to the media on 15 August 1992.

    The next day, a crop circle UGM was discovered in the wheat field
    over which the UFO had travelled.  See NAICCR case 920815.1

    A witness reported a bright green object, "like an airplane going
    to crash".  The object was rapidly moving from the west to the
    east, but looked like it was "going up".  The object had a "long
    tail".  It appeared to be over the Winnipeg airport.  It was
    visible for only a few seconds.

    A full report on the incidents, with detailed drawings of the crop
    formations, will be available in hard copy from NAICCR at a later date.
    The full report will be published in a major UFO journal and cerealogy
    journal.  The Strathclair flap of UGMs and UFOs will be noted in the
    annual NAICCR and UFOROM reports when published in 1993.

                                  Reported in 1992

         Since 1990, NAICCR (North American Institute for Crop Circle Research)
    has been requesting and collecting information on UGMs (unusual ground
    markings) in North America. The 1990 and 1991 NAICCR reports were widely
    circulated, and have been reprinted in a number of books and publications
    around the world.  The favourable response of the ufology and cerealogical
    community to NAICCR's efforts has encouraged the continued gathering of
    data for comparison and analysis.

         One of the reasons NAICCR has been making UGM and crop circle data
    available to researchers is because no comparable reports are produced
    regarding UGMs in Britain. Various factions and cerealogists are said to
    maintain extensive databases on crop circles, but the data is normally not
    disseminated.  True, several coffee-table books have been published with
    remarkable aerial photographs of unique formations, and cerealogy
    "alphabets" have been circulated which categorize the agriglyphs, but raw
    data including all possibly relevant parameters is hard to come by.  In
    addition, there is the alleged "hoarding" of crop circle data by some
    researchers, and the selective winnowing of cases by others.

         Since British data has been so elusive to some researchers, NAICCR
    associates have attempted to gather UGM data from the entire continent of
    North America, rather than focusing upon the British scene.  This has been
    no small feat.  The effective area of North American cerealogy is several
    times larger than that of Britain, so North American cerealogists have a
    much more difficult task than their counterparts across the ocean.
    "Stakeouts" of circle-prone areas are possible in England, but not in
    America.

         The principle which guides the collection and dissemination of crop
    circle data by NAICCR is the open exchange of information for all those
    involved in the field.  It has been suggested that the sharing of
    information and the co-operation between researchers is a vital aspect of
    both ufology and cerealogy.

         In practice, although requests for information are frequently made,
    relatively few researchers and investigators respond by sending NAICCR the
    required data.  Typically, local investigators send information to regional
    directors of their organizations, if they send their information to anyone
    at all.  The quality and style of investigations tend to vary considerably,
    and therefore make comparative studies very difficult.  The need for
    standardization of investigative techniques is clearly an issue in UGM
    studies.

         As a result, information about many UGMs comes by way of second-hand
    sources, newsletters, magazines, computer bulletin boards and media
    reports.  Some reports of UGMs are nothing more than rumours, despite
    attempts to substantiate claims and alleged witnesses' accounts.  For these
    reasons, the usefulness of the data is limited.  However, it is the
    position of NAICCR that the collection and publication of this data are
    important in the development of the field.  At the very least, researchers
    who perhaps read only a few publications can be apprised of the broader
    aspect of the phenomena, and the variety of the cases.

         While it is admirable that many researchers have taken it upon
    themselves to study specific cases or aspects of UGMs, those who claim
    expertise or are portrayed as being very knowledgeable of the subject are
    sometimes poorly versed in the phenomenon.  Indeed, some lack the necessary
    background to speak with authority on UGMs or related phenomena.  This has
    resulted in some "experts" making unscientific or otherwise unsupported
    claims during media interviews, contributing to misconceptions about the
    facts of the phenomenon.

         The situation is complicated further by the delineation of "camps"
    within the UGM field, whether they be vortex theorists, UFO adherents,
    skeptical refuseniks or ultraterrestrialists.  These are additional reasons
    why an objective presentation of all the raw data from all sources is
    considered essential in order to gain a more complete understanding of the
    phenomena.  It is the hope of NAICCR that the presentation of North
    American UGM data in this Report will encourage more co-operation and
    discussion among researchers at all levels, whether the reader is an
    armchair theorist, a field investigator or a debunker.

         The general position of NAICCR is that no one theory is favourable
    over any other at the present time.  This flies directly against the belief
    by many skeptics that "all crop circles are hoaxes", and also the belief by
    many ETH supporters that crop circles are definitely communications from
    aliens.  The hoax issue is not trivial.  Debates are raging between
    cerealogists concerning the fraction of "genuine" formations that have been
    found.

         First of all, we must realize that the exact determination of this
    fraction is impossible, since we have no exact figure for the number of all
    UGMs in Britain.  Are there 1000 recorded sites since 1980?  2000?  3000?
    Do the numbers reflect individual UGMs, or complete formations?  Is a site
    with ten "grapeshot" circles counted as "ten" or "one"?

         Second, cerealogists have gone on record as saying that hoaxers have
    become so proficient at their craft that there is now no way to tell a
    "genuine" circle from a "fake" one. The implications of such a statement
    should alarm researchers.  If hoaxed circles look "genuine", then all
    circles could be hoaxes just as easily as all circles could be "real".

         Third, claims of hoaxing are themselves not proof of hoaxing.
    Although skeptics would invoke Ockham's Razor and point out that hoaxing is
    the simplest explanation for crop circles, the problem is more complex than
    that.  Aside from the Bower/Chorley demonstrations, comparatively few
    hoaxers have admitted their handiwork and have described their exact method
    used.  This has resulted in many cerealogists adopting a "doubting Thomas"
    attitude;  unless hoaxers are caught red-handed or come forward after the
    fact with detailed information about their hoax effort, the hoaxers are not
    to be believed.

         In North America, though several individuals have claimed to have
    hoaxed crop circles, only a few have met the "doubting Thomas" criteria.
    The situation is much worse in Britain, given the larger number of sites.
    A common observation among cerealogists is that hoaxing cannot be a viable
    explanation because thousands of crop circle sites would require huge
    armies of hoaxers, all of whom were clever enough to make intricate
    formations without being seen, indeed, in some cases, under the watchful
    eyes of surveillance cameras.

         But are the logistics of hoaxing really that impossible?  Since many
    formations were discovered days or even weeks after they were likely
    created, they could have been done without any witnesses.  By the time many
    were found, visitors might have trampled tell-tale signs of hoaxing.  We do
    not have accurate figures available on the fraction of sites which were
    under observation, and which were also investigated prior to visitors.  How
    many of the 1000 (or 2000) UGMs are considered highly reliable?

         Let us assume that there is one determined and expert crop circle
    hoaxer in Britain. Let us also assume that he (or she) made one crop circle
    per night during a 100-day farming season.  This one person could have made
    all 1000 circles in Britain since 1980!

         This is absurd, of course.  The time requirements, personal cost,
    travelling, secrecy and other factors would make this scenario ridiculous.
    But let us assume that the variables were altered.  Suppose there were ten
    hoaxers.  Suppose that ten crop circles were made each night.  Suppose that
    some circles were created by a mysterious natural or preternatural
    phenomenon (!).  The reader is left to speculate upon other scenarios.
    This exercise does not, by itself, imply that hoaxing is the most likely
    explanation for crop circles.  However, it puts into perspective the
    problems of coming to terms with the phenomenon.

         What of the other theories?  What evidence is there to support the
    vortex or extraterrestrial theories?  In the former, there do exist several
    dozen recorded cases of eyewitnesses to strong, spiralling downdraughts
    making circular patches in wheat or tall grasses.  Both Ohtsuki and Meaden
    have presented physical arguments that simple crop circles could be made by
    wind vortices, and have hypothesized certain physical conditions that might
    be conducive to crop circle creation (sides of hills, winds, etc.).
    However, given the difficulty of weeding "genuine" circles from the dross
    in the data, the theory requires some refining.  In addition, a "natural"
    mechanism would demand the creation of formations in great numbers around
    the world, not just confined to a small area in Britain.  Perhaps, the
    NAICCR reports will serve to support the theory.

         On the other hand, TIF (Theory of the Intelligent Force) seems
    supported by eyewitness accounts and videos of unusual lights or structured
    objects near crop circle sites. Some vortex theorists might say these are
    special cases of plasmas in action, but some TIF proponents insist that
    added factors such as weaving and complex patterns rule out a natural
    mechanism.

         In terms of physical changes within crop circles, results are
    interesting, though not completely satisfying.  Tests have shown no sites
    to have residual radioactivity, despite earlier heralded claims to the
    contrary.  Spagyrical analyses, dating back to the days of alchemy and not
    given much scientific weight today, attempted to show "crystallization" of
    plant cells from within crop circles.  This evidence is not as credible as
    many would believe.  We are left with the body of evidence produced through
    analyses by Dr. W. Levengood of Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratories.  His
    results, published in a series of reports, purport to shown "changes" or
    otherwise significant abnormalities in samples taken from circle sites.
    The prospect of proving abnormalities within crop circles using these
    results is very exciting, though it would be preferable if other
    independent laboratories could confirm the effects.

    Results of the 1992 Study

         As of 31 January, 1993, there had been 93 UGMs (unusual ground
    markings) reported or otherwise communicated to UFOROM (Ufology Research of
    Manitoba) or NAICCR during the 1992 calendar year.  These represented only
    40 different sites or locations; some cases had multiple associated UGMs.
    The set of UGMs includes those features commonly called "crop circles" as
    well as features known as "saucer nests", "space cookies", "burn marks" and
    "landing traces".


         The UGMs were classified in the following categories:

                        1. FC - Flattened Circle
                        2. FR - Flattened Ring
                        3. BC - Burned Circle
                        4. BR - Burned Ring
                        5. BF - Burned and Flattened
                        6. CR - Concentric Ring
                        7. VM - Vegetation Missing
                        8. VD - Vegetation Dead
                        9. YG - Yellowing of Grass
                        10. SG - Stunted Growth
                        11. EG - Enhanced Growth
                        12. DP - Depression
                        13. HO - Hole
                        14. OT - Other

    The classification system is not mutually exclusive, and some sites may
    contain more than one category of UGM.

         A problem in the statistical tabulation of UGM data is the lack of
    standardization in the counting of the UGMs.  At some sites, only a single
    UGM is observed, while at others, there may be dozens.  Some researchers
    have chosen to count each UGM separately, but many count features according
    to sites.  A "quadruplet" may therefore be counted as "4" or "1", depending
    on the system used. A more complex feature such as an "agriglyph" poses
    additional problems: is a count of its component circles, triangles, etc.,
    of real analytical value?  The NAICCR data is presented with both counting
    schemes; researchers can adopt their own systems for interpretation.

         It is interesting to note that the number of UGMs per year has
    remained about the same since 1990.  This might suggest that UGMs are a
    continuing, constant phenomenon like their cousins, UFOs.

                      UGMs in North America in 1992
                      =============================

                  Canada      %       USA        %       Total
    ============================================================
    Total UGMs  |   47   |  50.5%  |   46   |  49.5%  |   93   |
    # Sites     |   21   |  52.5%  |   19   |  47.5%  |   40   |
    ============================================================


         Of the 93 total UGMs found in North America, 47 (50.5%) were in Canada
    and 46 (49.5%) were in the United States.  When the number of sites is
    examined, the distribution is essentially the same: 21 (52.5%) in Canada
    and 19 (47.5%) in the United States.  When compared with previous years,
    the 1992 data suggests several things.  First, the number of reported UGMs
    in North America is constant, averaging around 90 UGMs/year.  Second, it
    would appear that the ratio of UGMs/sites is also constant, with a value
    near two.  In other words, the typical UGM case involves at least two
    impressions/effects, and are more properly called formations.

         If we assume that the mechanism for reporting North American UGM cases
    is relatively constant, this data does seem to show a "background" level of
    UGM activity, something that had been suspected by some researchers.  More
    to the point, it suggests that the huge numbers of crop circle UGMs in
    Britain are an anomaly.  Some would read this as a confirmation of
    widespread hoaxing and contamination of British UGM data.  To others, this
    implies that the British hills and valleys are host to a truly unique
    phenomenon, incomparable to UGM activity elsewhere in the world.  Indeed,
    the constancy of the American numbers seems to show that American and
    British UGM activity, specifically that of crop circles, are different
    effects with different causes.  Why this is so is not completely clear at
    this time.

         As in previous years, there was an uneven distribution of UGMs
    throughout North America in 1992.  Significant numbers of cases were
    reported in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, which had few UGMs reported in 1991.
    Illinois had the largest number of American cases in 1992, as in previous
    years.

         There was a strong, significant difference in the direction of swirl
    reported for crop circles.  Of the cases for which swirl data was reported,
    28 swirls were counterclockwise, and only one was clockwise.  All swirled
    UGMs were in Canada.

         The diversity of the crops affected by UGMs is evident in the above
    table.  The public impression that crop circles appear exclusively in wheat
    is clearly wrong.  Furthermore, the British label of "corn circles" is also
    a misnomer for North American cases, though this is due more to idiom than
    botany.  Some researchers such as AUFOSG have noted this problem of crop
    identification, and have included the proper scientific names of affected
    UGM crop in their reports.  If other groups adopt this system, it may
    alleviate some confusion.

         The most marked change from 1991 is the increase in wheat formations
    in the United States.  There were 21 in 1992, but only 1 in 1991.
    Otherwise, UGM activity was as varied as in previous years.

    In 1992, the average diameter of UGMs was 10.62 metres.  In 1991, the
    average diameter of UGMs was 7.06 metres.  The 1990 average was 10.7
    metres.

         The "UFO Connection" to UGMs and crop circles alleged by some
    researchers is not borne out by the 1992 data.  UFOs were reported in
    conjunction with only 4 UGM sites, representing 10% of the cases.  We can
    note that Ted Phillips' Catalog of Physical Traces Associated with UFO
    Sightings, published in the 1970's, had a similar fraction of cases. Many
    of the UGMs listed in his Catalog had no associated UFO activity.  In other
    words, the overall characteristics of trace cases and UFO effects have not
    changed dramatically over the years; only our identification and naming the
    sites as "crop circles" instead of "physical traces" has evolved.

         In 26 UGMs (28%) or at 8 sites (20%), winds were noted as a possible
    explanation. As many as 18 UGMs (19%) at 8 sites (20%) were given probable
    explanations.  As can be seen in the annotated list of cases, cerealogists
    are rapidly gaining expertise in crop effects such as lodging and blights.

         The characteristics of 1992 UGMs varied considerably.  As many as 11
    UGMS (12%) at 7 sites (17.5%) were described as possessing "corridors".  No
    complex formation such as the Coalhurst structure of 1991 was discovered,
    though smaller oddities such as "dumbbells" and "Mars symbols" were noted
    in 1992.

         The listing of UGM data does not include any indication of the
    investigations and conclusions reached by researchers regarding the cause
    or reason for the existence of the features.  The limited information
    available for these analyses precluded any extensive discussion of the
    individual cases.  Some information about the cases will be found in the
    annotated case list later in this report.  Sources of information about the
    cases are provided, but researchers intending to use this data in their own
    studies are cautioned that NAICCR cannot vouch for the accuracy of reports.

         The question of physical or physiological effects reported at UGM
    sites should also be addressed here.  It has been claimed that electronic
    interference is sometimes experienced within or in the proximity of British
    crop circles.  Convincing support for this claim is much debated, but such
    effects have been noted in many cases, usually as an indication that UFOs
    have been involved.  Sometimes, vortex theorists imply that these effects
    may be related to plasma activity in the surrounding area.
         
         In both 1991 and 1992, several North American UGM sites were claimed
    to have associated effects.  Some sites were said to exhibit a positive
    effect when dowsed, while other sites produced eerie "energy", detected by
    sensitives.  Unfortunately, these effects do not seem to be consistent, and
    are not experienced by all witnesses or investigators at the same site.

         It is hoped that research into UGMs will benefit from studies of the
    raw UGM data. Researchers are urged to examine the data presented and
    prepare their own interpretations in order to further develop their
    theories about the origins of UGMs or the specific category of crop
    circles.

              ================================================

    920320    Dundee, Ohio
    - a "scorched-looking" circle, 27x30 feet in two diameters and with a
    "jagged" edge, was found in a pasture 1500 feet from a farmhouse.  The soil
    was not burned, however, and was found to contain "black particulate
    matter" of some kind.

    920426    Jonesboro, Georgia
    -  two large areas of flattened grass were discovered in about the same
    location that others were found in 1991.  One area was the size of a
    football field.  Weather damage was suspected.

    920506    New Sarepta, Alberta
    -  a "space cookie" UGM was discovered in a meadow.  It is a perfect
    circle, 6 metres in diameter. Its depth varies from 5 cm to 31 cm.  Grass
    is growing straight up both inside and outside the circle.  No tracks were
    found leading to the area.  The UGM is not a sinkhole.

    920512    Jefferson County, Tennessee
    -  several indentations were found in a grassy field.  Some were swirled
    circles, others "bars" and others irregular.  Probable lodging.

    920525    Limerick, Pennsylvania
    -  at least 12 "matted down" areas were found in a wheatfield north of
    Philadelphia.  Three were circles about five feet in diameter, arranged in
    a triangle.  One feature was "T-shaped".  Soil samples taken by a UFO
    investigator "showed no irregularities".  Geiger counter readings were also
    normal.  Although a hoax was suspected by the UFO investigator, the owner
    of the field believes that the UGMs were caused by lodging, wind and
    fertilizer damage, and that "It happens every year".

    - a doughnut-shaped impression was found in sweet flag weeds.  The circle
    looked much like others that had appeared in the same field in 1991.
    Samples from the circles were analyzed by Dr. Levengood and shown to have
    abnormalities.  A skeptic posted an admission of hoaxing on a computer
    bulletin board, but this was never verified.

    920627    Raeford, North Carolina
    -  a circle of flattened grass was found in a hay field following a CE2 UFO
    sighting.  A loud noise, "like a freight train", was heard, and two
    witnesses ran to look out their front door.  A object "the size of a
    swimming pool", "like orange windows all around it", was in a field about
    300 feet away from their house. When they went to call other witnesses, the
    object disappeared.

    9207??    Miniota, Manitoba
    - it was reported that a circle was found in an oat field.  It was
    perfectly round and 32 feet in diameter.  The oats were flattened and
    swirled clockwise.  The center of the circle is devoid of vegetation.

    9207??    Pilot Peak, California
    - according to the Phoenix Project, "landing zones" were discovered near
    the site of an alleged underground UFO base.  Visits to the site by
    independent investigators found only patches of grass trampled by deer.

    920701    St. Adolphe, Manitoba
    -  nine "horseshoe-shaped" patches of flattened grass were found on either
    side of a brook in a Winnipeg suburb. Because of recent storms and heavy
    rainfall, lodging was thought to be the cause.

    920705    Fergus Falls, Minnesota
    - a "dumbbell" formation was discovered in alfalfa.  Two 15-foot circles
    were connected by a 25-foot shaft.

    920705    Hobbema, Alberta
    -  two ovals of flattened barley were found in a field after unusual lights
    were observed descending to the ground.  The largest UGM has a major axis
    of 47 feet.  The crop is pushed away uniformly from the centers of the
    patches, but the centers are "clumped", like breaking waves.  Barley inside
    the circles is "white", and devoid of colour.  It was later suggested that
    the areas were due to spilled seeds and fertilizer, combined with lodging.
    Source: Gord Kijek, AUFOSG

    920715    St. Adolphe, Manitoba
    -  a field beside a highway was discovered to have numerous patches of
    flattened crop, in irregular patterns.  The formations were discovered by
    the same person who found case 920701.  Investigation by NAICCR and
    interviews with the owner of the field established that the crop had been
    laid down by strong winds and heavy rain.  The person who discovered the
    formations was convinced that aliens created the flattened patches.

    920721    Friedensruh, Manitoba
    -  a farmer found a triangular area of flattened/swirled grass which was
    surrounded by an electric fence.  The dimensions were 31x27x17 feet.  Local
    residents could not explain the phenomenon.  However, NAICCR investigators
    found evidence that animals had trampled the site.
