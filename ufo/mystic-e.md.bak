    11:11
         Having to do with the activation of energies on earth to awaken the ET
         consciousness of earth's inhabitants. See SpiritWeb at
         https://www.spiritweb.org/ Spirit/activation-11.11.html. Note the
         Celestine Prophecy also mentions humans evolving to a higher state of
         'energy' or consciousness.
    144,000
         Ashtar says these are the volunteers on earth who will reawaken to help
         earth evolve to the next phase of consciousness. The bible says these
         are 12,000 from each of the 12 tribes of Israel. See
         https://www.spiritweb.org/ Spirit/our-mission-athena.html.

         =====A=====

    Abzu
         Lord (male) of the ocean and the sea. Usually 'sea' refers to the great
         expanse of the heavens. Aka Absu. See also Sumerian gods.
    Adnon
         The Urantia Book says this Chaldean head priest was told by the angels
         that Jesus Christ was coming.
    Agharta
         This is the underworld. Hindu. aka Agharti, Agharta network, which
         includes Mt. Shasta, CA, and other energy centers of earth. These are
         the good guys. Their space fleet is called the 'Silver Fleet'.
         Andromodans (per Collier) say these lived on the planet Maldek (now the
         asteroid belt) and were the lost tribe if Lyrae. They were also called
         Ari-an. Note the Celestine Prophecy also mentions humans evolving to a
         higher state of 'energy' or consciousness.
    Alcyon
         The Maya say the solar system rotates around Alcyon in a 26,000 period.
         The end of this period is Dec 23, 2012 and is supposed to be the birth
         of Venus. See also Pleiades.
    aliens
         Entities not from this planet. See also Altair, amphibians (see
         cryptozoology), Arianni, Epsilon Eridani (Lyrans), grey aliens,
         insectoids, Lyrans, moon-eyed (large-eyed aliens), winged dracos
         (Mothmen), reptilians, 3 fingered, Tau Cetians (Lyrans), Taygetans,
         Ummites, Vegans.
    Altair
         Alleged reptilian inhabitants of the Altair stellar system in the
         constellation Aquila. Bad guys.
    amphibians
         Amphibian like creatures have been seen near the Ohio river on various
         occasions. These semi-intelligent creatures have been known to attack
         people without provocation.
    Anakim
         (also referred to as 'Els', 'El Anakim', short for 'Elder Race' or
         simply as the 'Giants'). Referred to in ancient Hebrew tradition, this
         race is allegedly tied-in with ancient humans who broke off from
         mainstream humanity because of their vast size which had developed over
         the centuries, possibly as a result of a genetic anomaly. They are said
         to range anywhere from 9-11 and in some cases even 12 ft. in height,
         although in configuration are remarkably similar to 'International'
         humans. They have allegedly been encountered in deep and extensive
         cavern systems from Alaska to Mexico, and are believed to have
         interstellar traveling capabilities (Evadamic). The "Book of Enoch"
         from the Dead Sea scrolls says how these men married earth women, who
         bore 'giants 3000 cubits high'. (Note, a cubit is 1 Sacred Jewish inch,
         so 3000 cubits would be about 250 feet.) See Nephilim, Annunaki.
    Andromodans
         Beings from Andromoda. (Good guys.) Collier says they are the oldest
         race in our galaxy and are very concerned about our future. They have
         light blue skin, but when they age, the skin becomes more white. The
         average age of Andromodans is 2007 years. Collier's contacts say in
         December 2013, we will cease to exist as 3rd density beings, and move
         up to 4th density. They say on Mar 23, 1994, an energy began radiating
         from black holes at the base of each galaxy to help in this transition.
         The contacts say the primate race was created by the Draconians, and
         first brought to Mars, then Earth. Back then, earth was closer to Mars,
         and covered with ice. They say humans are part of a soul group which
         they call Paa Tal, which were opposed to the Draconian influence and
         have warred with them for hundreds of thousands of years. They say that
         earth will be ruled by Draconic tyranny 357 years from now (about 2352
         AD) and have traced the shift of energy to our solar system, at this
         time (about 1995). Specifically to the earth, moon, and Mars.

         The Andromodan council agreed that all ET life should be removed from
         the earth, moon, and Phobos by Aug 12, 2003. They say there are only
         2000 original gray aliens, and most of them are on Phobos, a moon of
         Mars. (Most of the other grays are clones, thereby supporting the
         hypothesis that the grays are dying as a race due to genetic stagnation
         and they are looking for new DNA to revive their race.) If the aliens
         are not out of the moon by 2003, they will pull the moon out of orbit
         to "deal with it." They say our moon is an artificial satellite from
         another star system (the star Chauta in Ursa Minor).

         Some quotable quotes they said: "It is not so much the religion you
         believe in, but the reason you believe in it." "The love you withold is
         the pain you carry."

         See Leading Edge Research: Andromoda paradigm at www.eco.net/
         ~trufax/androm/androm.html. Note the Celestine Prophecy also mentions
         humans evolving to a higher state of 'energy' or consciousness.
    Andronover
         Per the Urantia book, this is the name of the nebula from which our
         universe formed.
    Anun
         Akkadian god of the heaven. See also Sumerian gods.
    Anunnaki
         Sumerian word for all the gods. In some Akkadian texts these are the
         gods of the underworld and Igigi are the gods in heaven. See also
         Sumerian gods. Warriors of Anu against Tiamat. Sitchin says these are
         the people from the planet Nibiru.
    archaeology, forbidden
         The commonly accepted premise is modern man, homo sapiens sapiens, has
         been around for only 100,000 years. However, there have been found
         stone tools and human bones going back 200,000 to 4 mil years ago.
         However this evidence has been suppressed. See Forbidden archaeology at
         https://www.spiritweb.org/ Spirit/Veda/Forbidden-Archeology/
         forbidden-arch.html.
    Arcturus
         Located in the constellation Bootes (one of the oldest constellations),
         it is a red-giant sun. Supposedly one of the most advanced
         civilizations in the galaxy (per Edgar Cayce). See
         https://www.spiritweb.org/ Spirit/arcturians.html. They are said to have
         3 bases on the moon and several on earth.
    Area 51
         This is a sub-area of the Groom Lake facility in Nevada where UFOs are
         stored, built, and tested. Also called Dreamland. See Area 51 website.
    Arianni
         Admiral Byrd, in his flyover of the North Pole, encountered some
         inner-earth people called the Arianni. Note the similarity to the word
         Aryan. Andromodans say these lived on the planet Maldek (now the
         asteroid belt) and were the lost tribe of Lyrae. They now live
         underground in Tibet. See Agharta.
    Ashtar
         Same as Ishtar.
    asteroid belt
         See planet Maldek.
    Atlantis
         Mark Hammons says the remains are in the Sargasso Sea, between the
         Bimini plateau and the Azore islands. He says Atlantis sat atop a
         'bubble' in the earth's crust. From this location, the Atlanteans could
         tap the various gases and EM radiation leaking from this bubble to
         power their technology. But eventually, this bubble burst, causing the
         Biblical and Sumerian flood. The Bermuda Triangle is the result of this
         disturbance which continues today. The Atlanteans were an 'extrusion'
         of 4 dimensional beings into the 3rd dimension. Some of their
         technology was 'threshold' technology, which could 'slip' you into an
         alternate earth, or continua. Much like the TV show "Sliders". Two
         primary 'threshold' sites are in the Gobi desert in central Asia, and
         in Mexico, with parts of the Mexican threshold in New Mexico and
         Arizona area. The Mexicans appear to be angry at the US for something
         and refuse to let the US military in to study the threshold. So the US
         goes to China. China wants the US to forget about the human rights
         violations. Done, and Bush and Clinton renews their Most Favored Nation
         status to boot. Second, China wants to be able to sell arms to whomever
         they want. US says "Done." This could help explain why the US
         continually ignores the human rights violations in China.

         The energy grid Atlantis was anchored to was detached from the physical
         earth during the war with the Reptoids on Maldek. It realigns itself
         with earth every 2000 years. It has locked on earth on Dec 7, 1995. The
         last alignment was when Christ was on earth. This grid is also known as
         "Herculobus" and "Wormwood" which is mentioned in the Bible. (Rev 8:11.
         Wormwood, a blazing star, fell out of the sky and turned 1/3 of the
         water undrinkable. Wormwood means bitter.)

         See also Lemurians, Atlas. See site Atlantis energy grid, DNA...
    Atlas
         Supposedly the first king of Atlantis. One of the original Titans of
         Greek mythology, he was defeated by the Olympians who were lead by
         Zeus. Zeus punished Atlas by having him hold the world on his back.
    atomic time
         Atomic time is defined in terms of one revolution of an electron in the
         ground state orbit of the hydrogen atom. The atomic standard by the
         cesium clock is accurate to limits of 8 x 10 (exp -14 ).
    auras
         Some say a person's personality can be determined by looking at their
         aura, however most people cannot see auras. Others say a person's aura
         changes with illness.

         =====B=====

    Babylon
         Built by Nimrod, this city is known as the start of the false religions
         of the world for worshipping Semiramis. It is now thought to be in
         Iraq.
    Beast, The
         In Revelations, the beast is described as having 7 heads and 10 crowns
         on its heads. In Akkadian mythology, Anum and Enlil (the sky god) are
         depicted as carrying 10 pairs of horns. Note that the there are 7
         industrialized nations that make up the G7.
    Berlitz, Charles
         Another researcher who wrote about the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and
         Noah's Ark.
    bermuda triangle
         Area southeast of Florida which exhibits strange properites: ships and
         planes disappear and never return, compasses and other electronic
         equipment don't work, etc. See Bermuda Triangle site (skeptic).
    Bikini Island
         Site of the first test of the atomic bomb. UFOs were seen fleeing the
         site and before the test, the natives reported lots of problems with
         their animals being mutilated (per Schneider).

    =====C=====

    Canis Major and Minor
         Orion's two hunting dogs following him. These are constellations.
    Cayce, Edgar (1877-1945)
         Noted psychic who had visions of Atlantis, the future, and many other
         things. See A.R.E at https://www.are-cayce.com.
    Celestine Prophecy
         Book by James Redfield, which says that humans have to perceive and
         understand 9 insights before they will evolve to a higher plane of
         existence. See sites: Celestine Central, Celestine Home Page, Celestine
         network.
    chakra
         Chakras (a Hindu word) are the energy vortices through which energy and
         matter are constantly shifting. Smaller vortices are the acupuncture
         points. There are seven chakras, each associated with a color and a
         facet of our existance (emotional, physical, spiritual, etc). See
         MuseNet website at https://users.aol.com/ MuseforU/muse1.html.
    Collier, Alex
         Says he has been in contact with Andromedans for some 31 years.
         Lectures about his experiences.
    Cooper, William
         Formerly of US Naval Intelligence, he wrote a book called "Behold a
         Pale Horse" which agreed the government had captured UFOs and live
         aliens. However, some UFO enthusiasts say this is subtle propaganda
         used to confuse the truth.
    cryptozoology
         The study of unexplainable creatures. Weird creatures include Nessie of
         Loch Ness, Scotland, Chessie of Chesapeke Bay, VA, Champ of Lake
         Champlain, Ogopogo, Bigfoot in the US Northwest, a huge eel-like
         monster found dead in the great lakes in 1996, Vietnamese Forest
         People, mermaids, Loveland OH frogman, Jersey devil. See Yahoo:
         Cryptozoology, Ron Schaffner files (frogman in Loveland, OH), sea
         serpents. See the Crim Ram series (https://linex3.linex.com/
         ufo/files.html) by Branton for more info about cryptozoology.

         =====D=====

    Dead Sea Scrolls
         Found in the ruins of Qumran, an old Judean fortress. See Dead Sea
         Scrolls exhibit website at
         https://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/deadsea.scrolls.exhibit/intro.html.
    Delta force
         An elite US military group that provides security at Area 51 and other
         high security complexes.
    draconic
         These are the lizard-like bad guys. Variations include insectoids
         (mantis-like), reptilians, saurians (dinosaur-like), and cross-breeds
         of the above. Collier's Andromodan contacts say these are master
         geneticists who have been in the universe the longest. The Andromodans
         don't know where they came from, nor do the Draconians. So this
         supports the Draconians belief that they are the original 'owners' of
         the galaxy, and they see humans as their subjects. A Draconian or ally
         can be identified by their lack of respect for free will.
    dynamic time
         A dynamical second is defined as 1/31,556,925.9747 of the earth's
         orbital period and was standard until 1967. See Constancy of the
         velocity of light website at www.best.com/~dolphin/constc.shtml.

         =====E=====

    Ea
         Chief god of the Sumerian city of Eridu. Akkadian Prince Ea. Later
         Akkadian Enki. Greek Oannes.
    earth
         aka Terra, Urantia.
    earthquakes
         Schneider says the gov't is using a Tesla device to create earthquakes.
         Examples of said earthquakes: Kobe, Japan; 1989 San Francisco; there
         was no pulsewave as in normal earthquakes.
    Ecker, Don
         A UFO researcher. He can be reached at 74270.3360@compuserve.com.
    Eden
         Means "delightful". L. Dolphin thinks the Garden of Eden is buried
         somewhere in present day Iraq under miles of sediment from the Great
         Flood. Dora Jane Hamblin, "Has the Garden of Eden Been Located at
         Last?" Smithsonian Magazine, Vol. 18, No. 2, (May, 1987).
    element 115
         According to Bob Lazar, this is the yet-undiscovered super-heavy
         element which will allow us to make technology to harness gravity
         waves.
    Elohim
         The uni-plural name of God used in Gen 1. Also the name for angels.
         This could also be a type of angel, as there are many types, including
         the seraphim and nephilim.
    Enlil
         Akkadian sky god.
    Epsilon Eridani
         This star system is inhabited by Nordic type aliens originally from
         Lyra. Good guys.
    Eridanus
         A constellation in the sky. These faint stars have been known as a
         river since ancient times, and have represented famous rivers such as
         the Nile and the Euphrates. See Epsilon Eridani.
    Euphrates river
         One of the first four rivers of creation. The others were Tigris,
         Gihon, Pishon. Also called Eufraat by Akkadians.
    evademic
         These are the good guys.

         =====F=====

     
         =====G=====

    Gnostics
         comes from Greek "gnosis" meaning "knowledge of God".
    grey aliens
         Mercenaries helping the malevalent aliens. Some have a box on their
         bodies, which (per Schneider) is a weapon which blasts some type of
         cobalt radiation energy. They are thought to be from Zeta Reticuli.
         There are generally 2 types of grays. Small: 3-4 feet tall with large
         black eyes; large: 6-7 feet tall, these are the diplomats which tell
         the small grays what to do. They are hairless with a very small nose,
         and no discernable ears. Their fingers are often long relative to human
         proportions. The large grays are thought to have 2 brains separated by
         a bulletproof bony septum, thus a bullet to the head won't kill them.
         Perhaps this is where the X-files gets the idea of piercing the base of
         the skull to kill them. Their blood is thought to be green, and when it
         makes contact with air, it makes a noxious ammonia-smelling gas which
         can kill a person. SpiritWeb supports the notion that the greys are
         genetically sterile and need new genes to make their race survive.
    Groom Lake, Nevada
         Location of secret underground bases and Area 51. Here the US
         government conducts testing of UFOs they have built with alien
         technology. The base is 7 levels deep, and requires top secret
         clearance to get to. See also Schneider.

         =====H=====

    HAARP
         A weather manipulation device based on Tesla technology used by the
         Navy. It is being tested since the late 60's, which is why we've been
         having the extreme weather since then (so the story goes). One location
         of a HAARP facility is Dayton, OH. Wright-Patterson AFB, also in
         Dayton, is also thought to house a UFO. See the Navy's HAARP site at
         https://server5550.itd.nrl.navy.mil/projects/haarp/.
    Hamites
         Descendants of Ham, son of Noah. These are the physical laborers mainly
         descended from the areas of: Egypt, Ethiopia, Crete, Arabia, Sino
         (Chinese and Japanese and Mongolians), Philistenes, Phoenicians,
         Canaanites, Sumerians, Babylonians.
    Hoagland, Richard
         Wrote a book about the face on Mars. See his website at
         https://www.hoagland.com/.
    Howe, Linda
         Wrote a book "An Alien Harvest" which describes cattle and horse
         mutilations. One possibility she raises is the aliens are using the
         cattle to monitor a toxin through our food chain that they put there.

         =====I=====

    insectoids
         These bad aliens resemble praying mantises, with long arms which fold

    Japhethites
         Descendants of Japheth, son of Noah. These are the philosophers, the

         from these areas: America, Indo-Europe, Spain, Greece, Rome.
    Jupiter
         One woman reports having her spirit transported to Jupiter by Jove
         himself and seeing intelligent reptiles in a council of 12. These
         reptiles claim to be a 3rd/4th dimensional type and claim to be

    Lazar, Bob
         A physicist who claims to have reverse engineered UFOs at the Area 51
         facility.
    Lemurians
         Aka the Atlanteans, Mu, Muvians. The religious people of this race
         tried to warn the world of an impending flood. They went underground,
         and in the USA, emerged as the Native Americans. In Australia, they
         emerged as the Aborigines, in the England area, as the Druids. The
         American Indians have a creation legend that says they came out of
         caves underground while the 'reptile people' were banished to
         underground. (Is this a reference to the grays or reptilians?)
         Andromodans say there is a large temple complex underwater, 150 miles
         south of Easter Islands that belonged to the Lemurians. See Atlas,
         Atlantis.
    Lear, John
         Son of the founder of the Lear Jet company. Appears to be allied with
         Bob Lazar. A 1987 posting to the internet claims aliens at Area 51 were
         eating humans.
    leylines
         Energy vortices from Atlantis that were damaged during the war with the
         Reptoids on Maldek. These were visible emanations of energy, until they
         were switched off. Also called 'dragon lines' by later civilizations.
    Lucifer
         God's second in command who fell from grace and took 1/3 of the angels
         with him. Lucifer means "bearer of Light". (Could this be a reference
         to actual light physics, or could 'light' refer to knowledge? Serpents
         and snakes are associated with wisdom in ancient myths.) The Bible says
         Noah lived almost 900 years. Dolphin explains this is due to a faster
         velocity of light. But when Lucifer 'fell', something bad happened to
         the universe and laws of physics and light. See Dolphin's essays under
         Sources below.
    Lyrans
         Lyra is the original star of the Nordic type aliens. Lyra was invaded
         by the saurian type aliens, and the Nordics escaped to the Pleiades,
         Hyades, and Vega. These are the good guys. Note that some Nordics have
         been seen under the control of greys, however.

         =====M=====

    Maldek
         Used to be the fifth planet from our sun, it is is now the asteroid
         belt. This is where our moon was first orbiting, after it was taken
         from Chauta in Ursa Minor. Watcher interprets the bible and says this
         was a planet of Elohim (rebel angels) that was destroyed by God. In
         Science magazine, Oct 1987, Drs. Cruikshank and Brown discovered
         organic compounds on 3 asteroids. Watcher also says the bible refers to
         this planet as Rahab.
    Marcab Confederacy
         This is a star system which contains the most powerful of suppressive
         influences on our world. See
         https://marlowe.wimsey.com/~rshand/streams/gnosis/terms.html#Incident
         II.
    Marduk
         Also called Nimrod. He was a Babylonian god. See also Sumerian gods.
    mars
         Some artifacts and ruins have supposedly been discovered on Mars. Such
         as the giant pyramid, and the 'face', which looks like a monkey. Also
         curious are the Martian canals. Some scientists say these are the
         result of the polar icecaps melting, flowing towards the equator one
         season, then flowing back up to the polar caps. This doesn't seem to
         make sense that it would flow back up to the icecaps without a major
         change in planetary spin or axis tilt. Mars is associated with the
         Roman god of war.
    Mars face
         There is a structure on Mars which looks like a monkey face. There are
         also other pyramid-shaped structures, which can't be natural, in the
         area on Mars known as Cydonia. The relationship of the distance between
         the face and pyramids is exactly the same as the Sphinx (see Planetary
         Mysteries) and pyramids here on earth. The Andromodans say this is a
         tomb. And on every planet in our solar system there is such a tomb at
         19.5 degrees North and South of the equator (they must mean there are 2
         tombs per planet?). This somehow harmonizes the solar system in direct
         opposition of positive energy, preventing us from spiritually evolving
         to the next density. Watcher interprets the bible to say that this
         'city' was the city of Lucifer. See Cydonia zone (most comprehensive
         sites about the face on Mars), Cydonia, Carlotto's Face on Mars.

    MJ12
         aka Majestic 12, Jason Society, Jason Scholars. This is a committee of
         12 members who analyze the alien activity and decide what to do about
         it. They direct several secret organizations to do different tasks, but
         each organization doesn't know about the other.
    men in black
         aka MIBs, Horlocks. These look like humans who act sluggishly and dress
         all in black. They are often seen in association with silent black
         helicopters, and often contact people who have had an alien contact.
    Monmatia
         The Urantia book says this is the name of our solar system.
    moon
         Supposedly, the Clementine space probe and the Apollo astronauts found
         alien ruins on the moon, including an exploded dome shaped building,
         and a tower-like thing called 'the shard'. There have also been reports
         that several of the Apollo missions saw a huge saucer on the moon.

         Andromodans say our moon is an artificial satellite from a star system
         in Ursa Minor named Chauta. It was from the 17th of 21 planets of that
         system and was placed around a planet here, named Maldek, which is now
         the asteroid belt. It had nine huge domed cities on it and sustained
         life. The other moon around Maldek was Phobos, now orbiting Mars. The
         beings who lived on our moon were Arians. The Pleiadeans moved our moon
         from Maldek to earth. Others say the craters on the moon are too
         shallow to be made from a meteor impact and the whole moon is hollow.
         It used to contain domed cities which were destroyed 113,000 years ago.
         See site: History of the Moon at https://www.cco.net/

    moon-eyed aliens
         A race of peaceable humans some 7-8 ft. tall, with pale-blue skin and
         large 'wrap-around' eyes which are extremely sensitive to light. They
         MAY be the same as the large humans allegedly encountered on the moon
         by our 'astronauts' according to John Lear and others, who in turn were
         silenced and not allowed to tell what they saw. These people may,
         according to some accounts, be allied to the 'Nordics' and/or
         'Blondes'. They claim to be descendants of Noah who traveled to the
         Western Hemisphere a few centuries after the deluge and discovered
         ancient antediluvian cavern systems and technologies which had been
         abandoned in the subterranean recesses. They have been encountered
         mostly in deep cavern-systems beneath the general region of the
         Ozarks-Arkansas and surrounding regions (Evadamic).
    mothmen
         These are draconic, winged reptiles, usually tall, about 6-7 feet. They
         are reported to fly, but don't have to flap their wings to do so. Their
         eyes are large and red, and most people report they have an inescapable
         hypnotic stare. Merely being around these types causes uncontrollable
         feelings of fear in humans. Perhaps this is just how their negative
         energy life force manifests itself. John Keel wrote a book about them.

         =====N=====

    Nebadon
         The Urantia book says this is the name of our local universe.
    Nephilim
         Race of giants who were morally degraded. Gen 6. Possibly from Lyra or
         Nibiru. The word means "those who came down." Sitchin links these to
         people as being from the planet Nibiru. See Anakim, Sitchin, mars face,
         planet Maldek.
    Nibiru
         Sitchin says this is the twelfth planet which orbits our sun every 3600
         years. He says these people helped build the pyramids. Their original
         landing site was Eridu, now in Southern Iraq. The reason Saddam Hussein
         wasn't captured during the Gulf War was because he was hiding in an
         ancient pyramid in this area, and the Americans didn't want to bomb it.
    Nimrod
         Built the Tower of Babel about 3300 BC. He also built Erech, and Accad,
         all of them in the land of Shinar. From that land he went into Assyria,
         and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and
         Calah. He may be a Nephilim as he was called "a mighty man", meaning a
         physically large man. Also called Marduk, who was a Babylonian god. He
         married Semiramis and supposedly had a son who was virgin born. See
         also Sumerian gods.
    n nodes
         Perfectly spherical objects, 4-5 meters in diameter, recovered from
         volcanic areas. They are made of a material of unknown composition, and
         appear to be highly reflective of all energy in the electromagnetic
         spectrum. See https://cadre.sjsu.edu/ skofflaw/.
    Noah
         God told him to build an ark in preparation for a flood which would
         purge the world of corrupted men. Noah's ark is believed to be on Mt.
         Ararat in Turkey, or Mt. Cudi (pronounced "Judi"). After the flood,
         Noah built a city at the foot of the mountain named Kazan (in the
         ancient kingdome of Urartu), which means "city of eight". There were
         eight survivors to the flood on Noah's ark, Noah and his wife, and his
         3 sons and their wives. See sites: Noah's Ark home page at

    Orion
         This constellation is said to contain the 'Gate to Eternity', or the
         gate to the heavens. Both good and bad aliens are associated with this,
         probably because the Draconians are trying to take over the Gate once
         again. The pyramids at the Necropolis in Egypt are in the same pattern
         and proportionally spaced as the stars in Orion's belt, which are about
         1400 lightyears away.

    Philadelphia experiment
         An experiment with sending a US water ship through hyperspace to

         experiment? When experimenting with an 'engine' reconstructed from the
         Roswell UFO in the 1940's, people 'disappeared'. When the engine was
         turned off, they reappeared. Most people went insane after this
         experience, but some told of a place which just like earth, but somehow
         different. See also Atlantis.

         The UFO crash in Roswell, NM in 1947 is so famous, I almost not need
         mention it. But I should mention that the GAO's report on the incident
         revealed that secret documents were destroyed regarding the incident,
         without proper authorization. This report was started by Congressman

    Sagan, Carl
         Carl Sagan, a respected astronomer and astrophysicist, is now a skeptic
         of the UFO phenomena, but in his mid-80's series of video essays,
         "Cosmos", he says simply by the law of averages, there must be other
         intelligent life out there.
    Satan
         aka Lucifer. In a vision of the Confederation, this is the ambassador
         from the Satanas Federation (note Federation means an alliance of
         several peoples, possibly the grays, reptilians, and mantis-like
         aliens), who is chastised by the Council for not following their laws,
         and meddling in the affairs of earth. The Urantia book mentions Satan
         is Lucifer's right-hand man, 2nd in charge, and thus is a different
         entity. Note that the Urantia book says Lucifer was a "duke" (or
         sub-administrator) of a region of our universe called Satania.
    Schneider, Phil
         Ex-engineer, expert in explosives, that worked to build the underground

    Sitchin, Zechariah
         Sitchin believes there is a 12th planet orbiting our sun named Nibiru.
         Nibiru has an orbital period of 3600 years. He believes that giants
         came from that planet to ours and were called Annunaki in the Sumerian
         legends, and that they will visit again when the planet comes close to
         earth again. He says as our solar system orbits closer to the galactic
         center, our DNA will be activated so we can evolve to higher spiritual
         beings. He wrote the following books about the subject: "The Twelfth
         Planet" (1976), "When time began" (1993). Scientists have located a
         large black mass in the southern skies (i.e. viewable only from the
         southern hemisphere.) They don't know what it is. See Sitchin
         (Zetatalk).
    soul
         The soul has different meanings to different religions.

              Gnostics: "gnostics believe that we as humans are 'outsiders'
              to this material universe. Our immortal godlike souls were
              trapped here in a body by evil forces, and we are
              reincarnated continually, while our true spiritual identities
              are clouded from our memory. It is our task to discover the
              hidden knowledge, or gnosis, that will allow us to escape
              this evil material world of illusion and return to our
              rightful place. We keep reincarnating until we learn how to
              escape." - Jeff Jacobsen, "The Hubbard is Bare"

    Streiber, Whitley
         Wrote several books about abductions, including "Communion" (1987) and
         "Transformation". Both of these books describe the grays as being
         friendly. He says how he felt intense fear when being near the grays,
         but the aliens explained to him that they were trying to teach him to
         overcome his deepest fears by facing them.
    subterrene, nuclear
         A machine to bore holes in solid rock, whereby the rock is melted and
         pushed to the sides of the tunnel, creating the appearance of a
         glass-lined tunnel. These machines can bore tunnels up to 12 feet high,
         and up to 5 miles in an hour. These tunnels are often associated with
         present aliens or ancient aliens. US patents exist for such a machine.
         A search at the US Patent office yielded patent 5,107,936, invented by
         Werner Foppe of Denmark. Patent applied for in Nov, 1988, and
         apparently granted in Apr 1992. Other patents exist also for the US
         Dept of Energy. This patent entry includes references to this
         technology in some mining and petroleum magazines. Also patent
         4,066,138, for a boring machine made from a high powered laser, applied
         for in Dec, 1976, for inventors Salisbury and Stiles. Other patents
         are: US Patent No. 3,693,731, 26 Sep 1972, 2 more patents in May, 1975.
         Funny, the public patent database only goes back to 1976. See sites:

    Taygetans
         These aliens are from the star system Taygeta, in the Pleiades star
         cluster, in the constellation Taurus. So they're probably the Nordic
         types originally from Lyra.
    Thera
         A volcano which erupted in the 1400s BC, leaving a ring-shaped island

    Ummites
         Humans claiming to hail from the general area of Wolf 424, some 14-plus
         light years distant from the Earth-Sol system, and possibly having
         ancient ties with the 'Lyran' colonies in that the Ummites (from the
         planet Ummo) are like the Lyrans-Pleiadeans said to be 'Scandinavian'
         in appearance, and therefore may tie-in with the so-called 'Nordic
         Blond' societies (Evadamic).
    United Nations
         Said to be a group of gullible people led by a few individuals intent
         on NWO. The United Nations' charter was to keep peace after WWII, but
         since then has served in non-military roles at the expense of
         tax-payers. Examples are: Rwanda, where US military personnel delivered
         food and other goods. Bosnia: where UN personnel were there to keep the
         peace, but were fired upon by the Nazi-supporting Serbians and were
         ordered to no return fire. The US is supposed to pay yearly dues to the
         UN but has so far fallen behind. See https://www.un.org site, UN Office
         of Outer Space Affairs.
    Urantia
         This is the name of our planet. Per the Urantia book, it is
         administered by Christ Michael (aka Jesus Christ) and is the central
         shrine of Nebadon.
    Urantia Book
         From their web page: "It tells about Deity, the organization and
         administration of universes and the relation of the planet on which we
         live to the universe, of the genesis and destiny of man and his
         relation to God, and of the teachings of Jesus Christ. It speaks to
         man's deep spiritual yearnings and satisfies the intellect, fully
         harmonizing religion, philosophy, and today's science through the
         fostering of individual spiritual growth and an understanding of the
         universe which are commensurate with man's intellectual and cultural
         development." Quite a mouthful, but worth a look. It also explains why
         the planets are not in the plane of rotation of the sun, and retrograde
         motion (like Mars). See https://www.urantia.org.
