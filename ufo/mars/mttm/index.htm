<P>
This is a short account by an early UFO contactee.
Mr. Ferguson, who also wrote a pamphlet called <I>Relax First,</I>
tells us without any trace of irony that
'I had become adept at the art of relaxation.'
One day in 1938, while 'relaxing,' he has an out-of-body
experience, during which he takes a trip to Mars and meets
its kindly, optimistic inhabitants.
Naturally, they have a epochal message for Mr. Ferguson...
