In the early years of the twentieth century Percivel Lowell and others
speculated that Mars was inhabitated by an intelligent species much
older than our civilization. This page archives texts (fictional and
otherwise) about this hypothesis.

*About the photo*: This is a recent (2001) Mars Orbiter photo of the
notorious 'face' formation in the Cydonia region. Is it just an
unusually symmetrical mesa or a huge, heavily eroded *artificial*
landform? You be the judge... It helps if you view this photo at a
distance or squint a bit.
