# CHAPTER I.

### THE PLANET MARS AND ITS INHABITANTS

Years ago, as you measure time, I was an inhabitant of Mars, your sister
planet. My name is Eros Urides (the latter signifying "of Urid"). But a
physical name is only an incidental in one's life.

In the Spirit world we are given a name in accordance with our spiritual
qualities and gifts and the kind of work we do.

I came into material being as the fruit of the sacred union of my
parents. It is not necessary to say aught concerning their social
status, for on Mars all who unfold into a material expression of the
Father are equal. Equal in rank, station, and in possession of the
material fruits of earth.

After my education had been completed I was, in accordance with the
Martian system of scientifically determining one's rightful vocation,
assigned as overseer to a section of one of the main canals supplying
water from the North Polar cap to an impounding reservoir near the city
of Urid, the place of my birth.

I was in the 36th year (Martian reckoning) of my physical life on the
planet when my transition occurred, which event was the result of my
inability to observe, one night, warning signals sent out from a central
station advising the eve of a tremendous drop in temperature. This
occurred in the Martian autumn, and I succumbed to the intense cold. I
was not married, so I left no immediate family except my parents,
brothers and sisters.

I have come to your Earth to give your inhabitants some idea of the
idealistic life lived by your more advanced brothers. I use the term
idealistic in a relative way only, for in God's universe the degrees of
material progress of His children are infinite in number.

In giving this information to the inhabitants of your world I have been
assisted by the spirits of many former wise children of your Earth.

The purpose of the information which I am about to impart to your people
is mainly to stimulate and hasten into material expression the reign of
God's kingdom on your Earth.

Many will reject this information, but it is God's truth nevertheless.
But on the other hand, many of God's children now functioning on your
planet will accept the statements as true, and they will be helped and
encouraged in their hard struggle for material existence. This struggle,
unequal as it is, is the result of darkness engendered by the loss of
faith in God.

Man's faith in his Creator, in the ages preceding your present era of
darkness, was sublime. Man's attitude towards, and his confidence in the
promises of God was as the faith of a child to its parents, whom it has
always trusted. But selfishness has gained the upper hand, and is now
man's master on your Earth. To break the chains now binding man to self
is the purpose of God's holy emissaries, who have descended from high
spiritual spheres to your Earth to teach and show men the way out of
bondage. They will succeed, for Omniscience has commanded it. It is
under their direction that I am now contributing my little part in this
movement.

I am only too glad to have been able to give the information contained
in this book, and I also appreciate the assistance of all those on your
Earth plane who so willingly assisted; but of course we are all obeying
the Father's command.

As life is an attribute of the entire universe, the material aspect of
all God's creations are the same. That is, life on another planet must
be thought of as being no different from what experience teaches you.

All inspiration comes from the Father. Hence, the degree of a race's
advancement in point of civilization is in proportion to its spiritual
enfoldment. Therefore the material aspect of life, which includes God's
evolutionary and non-evolutionary creatures, is the same on every
habitable globe in limitless space.

In telling the story of Mars you must be prepared to believe that, from
a physical point of view, the Martians are just human beings, differing
little from the people of your Earth.

The same may be said concerning the activities of life enjoyed by all of
God's creatures. Martians work and have their recreations. They enjoy
the fruits of their earth just as you do the fruits of yours. They have
invented labor-saving machinery, and indulge in a multitude of
industrial pursuits, but with this difference: their economic system is
such that the life of the Martian is not the struggle for existence you
have created on your Earth. On the contrary it is a pleasurable life in
which work is as much enjoyed as is recreation. This condition is due to
two causes. First, Mars is much farther advanced as a world in its
evolutionary career. Second, the Spiritual enfoldment of its inhabitants
is proportionately advanced.

As the Divine Plan is universal in its scope the physical
characteristics of Mars, compared to your Earth are, in a general way,
the same, with the exceptions shown later in this book.

The inhabitants of Mars enjoy a blue sky, mountains, hills, rocks and
dells, clouds, beautiful sunsets, and in fact most of the physical
phenomena witnessed by the dwellers of your Earth.

The Martians live and have their being just as your people do, but they
are surrounded by a different spiritual and a modified physical
environment. They take pleasure in music, art and the study of physical
science, but with this difference: the spiritual growth and enfoldment
of the individual is considered as most important, and all material
advancement as only an aid to ultimate ends.

With main points in view the reader can now readily comprehend the real
Martian character, although it may be a disappointment to some who have
imagined the inhabitants of Mars as physically different from
themselves; or perhaps, as semi-spiritual entities, who have possibly
been transplanted from other worlds to undergo a sort of probationary
life amid a Paradise of beautiful surroundings and things.
