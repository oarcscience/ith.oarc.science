# CHAPTER XVIII.

### MATERIAL LIFE A LESSON

At the expense of what may appear as painful reiteration it is my desire
to impress upon the readers of this book this Truth: Material life is
necessary to unfold character, to develop the real self, the Divine part
in man: the only principle that endures forever.

There is a lesson in every phase of work, in every joy, in every sorrow.
That lesson is LOVE. Until you have fully realized this truth you will
not become full heirs in the Kingdom of God. "He that loveth is born of
God."

Christ taught that the Kingdom was not of your Earth, and that all
material things are transitory and would ultimately vanish like mist.

The story of Mars is a lesson to you as to what may be accomplished
towards a more harmonious relation with the Father: towards a truer
realization of God's real Kingdom. But in any event you should not
idolize the Mars people, for the Father's Kingdom is more perfect. Mars'
idealism is only a degree in the progress in the Cosmic Family of
worlds. The soul must really strive for a higher goal.

The Martians, after ages of time, have mastered their natural passions
in suppressing self, but they have other heights to scale. But he who
conquers a sordid environment; he who rises from a black pool of
iniquity; he who finds the Father's Kingdom amidst an uncompromising
warfare with sin deserves more credit than he who is favored by
circumstances of birth with more congenial surroundings and a higher
Spiritual environment.

You must remember that the individual on Mars, although living amidst an
idealism, is beset with problems of life also. Our problems are more
subtle and of a very different character than you are accustomed to deal
with. Every plane of life has its complexities. If this were not so, the
stimulus for growth would be weak indeed. Your most apparent problems
are material only to your understanding, since you are living under a
most pernicious social and economic system, a system which puts a
premium on selfishness.

All sentient entities are functioning in a universe of Relativity, and
the perfectness of the Martian character and the ideal material and
spiritual aspects of the planet are so by comparison only.

Martians are self-conscious of their shortcomings and aspire to higher
things in God's Kingdom, for progress is eternal and the ultimate goal
is never reached on the material plane of action, for the pinnacle of
all progress is God. "BE YE PERFECT, EVEN AS YOUR FATHER IN HEAVEN IS
ALSO PERFECT."
