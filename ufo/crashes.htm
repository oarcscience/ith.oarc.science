Alleged UFO Crashes

The following list of UFO crashes was compiled by the Phoenix Foundation
from numerous sources within the Gemstone Intelligence Network (GIN), an
international intelligence organization founded and operated by the Phoenix
Foundation. For further information on Phoenix Foundation membership or to

Foundation, Research Division, P.O. Box 92008, Nashville, Tennessee 37209.

April 17, 1897 - Aurora, Texas
A mysterious airship is said to have crashed in this town, exploding into
many small fragments. Reportedly, the occupant was child-size and greenish,
and the craft contained papers covered with heiroglyphics. The pilot's
body is supposed to be buried in the local cemetery. Although the case was
widely regarded as a hoax, new investigation brought to light a peculiar
alloy that was eventually analyzed by the McDonnell Aircraft Company.

Dec. 22, 1909 - Chicago
Six years after Kitty Hawk, newspapers from New York to Chicago were
astounded by national reports of a huge airship flying across the nation
and seen by thousands. It crashed west of Chicago, but was never found.
The story was front-page news in the nation's major newspapers.

1933 or 1934 - Ubatuba, Brazil
Witnesses on a beach are said to have seen a disc dive and explode,
showering the area with silvery fragments of highly pure magnesium.

May, 1947 - Spitzbergen, Norway
A report by journalist Dorothy Kilgallen stated that British scientists
and airmen were excavating the wreckage of a mysterious flying ship. The
Swedish military acknowledged its extraterrestrial origin and reported
17 bodies were found.  The story appeared as a tiny blip for only one
day in the U.S. news media before it was silenced by the military.

July 2, 1947 - Roswell, New Mexico
The most famous and thoroughly investigated by journalists, this is the crash
that launched Majestic-12. It was the first and only time the U.S. government
publicly admitted it had recovered a crashed flying saucer. Within hours, the
craft was whisked off to Wright-Patterson AFB and a new cover story emerged,
claiming it had been only a weather balloon.  In recent years, the officer
responsible for that cover story has recanted. Three or four humanoid bodies
were recovered; one was alive for a short time.

February 13, 1948 - Aztec, New Mexico
Three radar units tracked a falling UFO. Secretary of State George C.
Marshall requested a search party be dispatched from Camp Hale in
Colorado. A helicopter

team found a crashed 30-foot disc 12 miles northeast of Aztec and recovered
2-12 badly burned humanoids. The disc is stored in Hangar 18 at
Wright-Patterson AFB near Dayton, Ohio.

August 1948 - Laredo, Texas
Four officers witnessed the crash of an object and the recovery of bodies
38 miles south of Laredo, Texas, in Mexico. The information came from an
NBC affiliate in Chicago, who received it from a source in Army security.

August 19, 1949 - Death Valley, California,
Two prospectors named Mace Garney and Buck Fitzgerald claimed to have
watched an object crash in the desert. It was a 24-foot disc. The story
appeared on page 13 of the local Bakersfield newspaper the next day.

Before 1950 - Mexico
Roy L. Dimmick, sales manager for the Apache Powder Company of Los Angeles,
spoke with a man from Mexico and another from Ecuador who had seen a disc
crash near Mexico City.

April 1950 - Argentina
Mr. E.C. Bossa found a strange disc and four small dead pilots in a remote
region of Argentina. He returned with a friend the next day and found only
a pile of warm ashes. A cigar-shaped object was seen briefly as it flew
overhead at a high altitude.

1953 - Brady, Montana
Mr. C.M. Tenney, returning from Great Falls to Conrad, saw an oval
object that followed his car while balls of fire fell all over the road.
Later that day he was phoned by a colonel from Malmstrom AFB who asked
him to come to the base at 10 a.m. the next day. He was escorted to a
windowless room inside a fenced-off compound and asked to sign a state-
ment. While doing so, he says he saw two men carrying large laundry bags
containing humanoid bodies.

May 21, 1953 - Kingman, Arizona
A USAF veteran claims to have participated in the recovery of a crashed
aluminum-like disc impacted 20 inches into the earth. It was oval, 32ft
wide. Inside were two swivel chairs, an oval cabin and numerous
instruments.  One 4-foot-tall occupant was recovered, dead. It had a
dark brown complexion and wore a silvery metal suit with no helmet. The
witness' affidavit was released by respected UFO researcher Ray Fowler
in UFO Magazine, April 1976.

Mid-1950s - Birmingham, Alabama
When a disc crashed near Birmingham, the area was cordoned off and humanoid
bodies were flown to Maxwell AFB, according to a man who claims to have
flown the helicopter with the bodies to a waiting aircraft.

Spring 1954 - Mattydale, NY
In this suburb of Syracuse, at 3 a.m. on a Sunday, an information 
specialist and his wife saw a 20-foot-wide object being examined on the
ground by several men who were taking pictures.  The next day an officer
told them the event was a military secret.  Later, police denied the
whole incident ever took place.

1959 - Frdynia, Poland
An object was reported to have fallen into the harbor. Divers recovered
pieces of shiny metal, which was examined by the Polytechnic Institute and
Polish Navy. Some material was reportedly lost. Several days later a small
humanoid was found on a nearby beach; its remains were sent to the Soviet
Union.

 March 1960 - New Paltz, NY
 Local law enforcement authorities captured a small humanoid outside his
 craft while two copilots escaped. The alien was turned over to the CIA
 and died 28 days later.

 January 1967 - Southwest Missouri
 A Mr. Loftin found a 40-inch disc and gave it to the U.S. Testing Company
 for analysis.

 November 9, 1974 - Carbondale, NJ
 A glowing object fell into a small lake outside town. Three teenagers
 saw it fall at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday. They observed a yellow-white
 glow under the water that shifted to a point 25 feet offshore. The boys
 were kept in a police car for three hours while a number of vehicles
 with floodlights and cranes removed a disc-shaped object and put it
 into a van. The following Monday, a railroad lantern and battery were
 recovered from the lake and officials called the whole thing a hoax.
 (Hoax? Or cover story?)

 May 17, 1974 - Chili, NM
 An Air Force team allegedly removed a 60-foot-wide metallic object from
 an impact area and moved it to Kirtland AFB.

 May 6, 1978 - Padcaya, Bolivia
 A large luminous object crashed on a 13,000-foot mountain. An expedition
 of soldiers and scientists was dispatched to the site, but was delayed
 by bad weather.  They found nothing.

 1978 - Soviet Union
 After a collision with a Soviet fighter plane, a disc-shaped object
 fell into the ocean off Finland, where it was recovered - with humanoid
 bodies - by a Soviet salvage team.
