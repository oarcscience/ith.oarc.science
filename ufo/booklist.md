    UFO Books -- The Serious Literature

       Compiled by Keith Rowell

       Please pass this list along intact to anyone who wants a copy.


         _________________________________________________________________

       This list is a quick guide to the best of the wide range of UFO books.
       The literature varies from naive believers to fanatic debunkers. This
       list, however, features the people in the middle: the UFO researchers.
       They believe genuine UFOs are a mystery needing a solution. Unlike UFO
       researchers, the naive believers and debunkers think alike since they
       both believe the mystery is solved. Naive believers "know" genuine
       UFOs are flying saucers piloted by space beings. Debunkers "know" it
       is all just psychology or perhaps some as yet undiscovered physical
       phenomenon. However, when mainstream scholars and scientists finally
       accept the challenge of the UFO mystery (which they haven't for 40
       years now), the naive believers will probably be closer to the truth
       than the debunkers.

       In order to join the debate about the reality of the saucers, you need
       to read at least half of these books. If you haven't, you haven't done
       the first thing that any scholar or scientist does -- a literature
       search and perusal (peruse means to read carefully, don't forget!).
       Remember, your opinion is worth no more than the depth of your
       understanding of a topic. The UFO, strange as it may seem to some of
       you, has a serious literature devoted it. Yes, it's true, this
       literature is definitely not scientific or scholarly in the strict
       sense of the word, but that is simply because enough scientists and
       scholars are not aware of the problem of the UFO yet. Every year,
       especially in the eighties and nineties, more and more scientists and
       scholars are turning a serious eye to the problem. This is happening
       despite the orchestration of negative opinion promoted over the years
       by the intelligence establishment of the US. Sad to say, US
       intelligence is part and parcel of the UFO problem. Anyone who ignores
       this is just plain naive.

      The list...
    Berlitz, Charles and William L. Moore. The Roswell Incident. New
    York: Grosset & Dunlap, 1980. 168pp. ISBN 0-448-21199-8.  The
    facts about the crash of a saucer in the summer of 1947 in New
    Mexico and how the US government covered it up.

    Bowen, Charles, ed.  The Humanoids. Chicago: Henry Regnery, 1969.
    256pp.  LC 77-126142. Good summary of the evidence compiled from
    material published in the British Flying Saucer Review magazine.

    Blum, Howard.  Out There: The Government's Secret Quest for
    Extraterrestrials. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1990. 300pp.  ISBN
    0-671-66260-0.  An important book since it is written by a former
    NY Times reporter who has written two other influential books --
    one about Nazi intelligence officers brought to America illegally
    after WWII and the other about the Walker spy case.  However,
    Blum's UFO book was apparently hastily done and, thus, somewhat of
    a disappointment in the UFO research community.

    Bullard, Thomas Edward.  UFO Abductions: The Measure of a Mystery.
    Vol. 1: Comparative Study of Abduction Reports.  (Bloomington, IND):
    Fund for UFO Research, 1987. 402pp.  This study by a PhD folklorist
    is must reading for anyone wanting to understand the depth and
    breadth of the abduction enigma. Bullard concludes UFO abduction
    stories are much too internally consistent down to small details to
    be classed as traditional folklore or typical dream material.

    Butler, Brenda, Dot Street, and Jenny Randles.  Sky Crash: A Cosmic
    Conspiracy. Sudbury, Great Britain: Neville Spearman, 1984. 283pp.
    ISBN 85435-155-8. Review and analysis of the facts in the British
    Bentwaters-Rendlesham RAFB case.

    Clark, Jerome. The UFO Encyclopedia, Volume 1: UFOs in the 1980s.
    Detroit, MI: Apogee Books, 1990. 234pp.  ISBN 1-55888-301-0. This
    encyclopedia is mostly the author's tour de force, but still delivers
    valuable information not easily available elsewhere.  Libraries
    should have this.

    Clark, Jerome.  The UFO Encyclopedia, Volume 2: The Emergence of a
    Phenomenon: UFOs from the Beginning through 1959. Detroit, MI:
    Omnigraphics, 1992. 433pp.  ISBN 1-55888-301-0.  The second
    volume of this fine work is must reading for those desiring real
    understanding of UFOs.

    Colombo, John Robert.  UFOs Over Canada: Personal Accounts of
    Sightings and Close Encounters. Willowdale, Ontario, Canada:
    Hounslow Press, 1991. 221pp.  ISBN 0-88882-138-7.  A nice book by a
    famous Canadian compiler of Canadiana of short UFO accounts mostly
    in the words of the witnesses themselves.

    Condon, Edward U. and Daniel S. Gillmor (ed.).  Final Report of the
    Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects (Conducted by the
    University of Colorado Under Contract to the United States Air
    Force). New York: Bantam Books, 1968. 965pp.  After close,
    competent study of over 100 UFO sighting reports, 30% couldn't be
    identified!  Read Condon's prejudiced introduction only after you
    have looked through the rest of the study.  The National Academy of
    Sciences rubber-stamped Condon's recommendations that no public
    funds be devoted to the study of UFOs.

    Conroy, Ed.  Report on Communion: An Independent Investigation of
    and Commentary on Whitley Strieber's Communion. New York:
    Morrow, 1989. 427pp.  ISBN 0-688-08864-3.  This journalist was a
    boyhood acquaintance of Strieber. When Strieber published
    Communion, Conroy decided to see if his story would hold up under
    an investigative journalist's scrutiny. Conroy says yes.

    Crystall, Ellen.  Silent Invasion: The Shocking Discoveries of a UFO
    Researcher. New York: Paragon House, 1991. 190pp.  ISBN 1-55778-
    493-0.  A UFO researcher uses her psychic abilities to locate UFOs in
    the field. Interesting for showing how a scientifically naive person
    still understands that scientific and scholarly proof is what is
    needed in the end. Many hard to interpret photos accompany the text.

    Curran, Douglas.  In Advance of the Landing: Folk Concepts of Outer
    Space. New York: Abbeville Press, 1985. 132pp.  ISBN 0-89659-523-
    4.  Valuable photographic presentation of UFO folklore.

    Deardorff, James W. Celestial Teachings: The Emergence of the True
    Testament of Jmmanuel (Jesus). Tigard, OR: Wild Flower Press,
    1990. 323pp.  ISBN 0-926524-11-9. An analysis of some of the
    collateral material from the extensive Billy Meier contact case.

    Delgado, Pat and Colin Andrews.  Circular Evidence: A Detailed
    Investigation of the Flattened Swirled Crops Phenomenon. London:
    Bloomsbury, 1989. 190pp.  ISBN 0-7475-0357-5.  The first of the
    picture books about crop "circles".  It's a very good presentation of
    the facts and their investigative methods. Some investigators
    believe UFOs may produce the "circles".

    Druffel, Ann and D. Scott Rogo.  The Tujunga Canyon Contacts.
    Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1980. 264pp.  ISBN 0-13-
    932541-7.  Good book about abduction/contact experiences.

    Eberhart, George M.  UFOs and the Extraterrestrial Contact Movement:
    a bibliography. Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1986. 1298pp.  ISBN
    0-8108-1919-8.  An outstanding listing of books, articles, movies,
    TV appearances, dissertations, conferences, etc., about UFOs and
    related phenomena.  No library in America should be without it.  Ask
    your public library to get a copy today!!

    Emenegger, Robert.  UFO's: Past, Present and Future. New York:
    Ballantine Books, 1974. 180pp.  ISBN 345-24189-4-150.  Good
    general book.  Emenegger produced a film documentary of the same
    name.  The US government hinted that it would give him some "real"
    flying saucer footage for inclusion in his film.  This didn't happen.

    Evans, Hilary and John Spencer (eds.).  UFOs: 1947-1987 -- The 40-
    Year Search for an Explanation. London: Fortean Tomes, 1987. 384pp.
    ISBN 1-870021-02-9.  Similar to the other book by Spencer and
    Evans, but more extensive. A must read for dedicated ufologists.

    Government Coverup of the UFO Experience. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.:
    Prentice-Hall, 1984. 259pp.  ISBN 0-13-136656-4.  Very important
    book summarizing what ufologists know from studying the thousands
    of FOIA-released government UFO documents.  Everything but proof
    of crashed flying saucers is here, and it's all from FOIA-released
    documents!

    Flammonde, Paris.  UFO Exist! New York: Putnam, 1976. 406pp.  ISBN
    399-11538-2.  Fine history of the subject from a radio
    producer/journalist. The book details the US government's
    involvement.

    Prentice-Hall, 1979. 239pp.  ISBN 0-13-036608-0. First book about
    a now famous abductee, Betty Andreasson Luca.

    Good, Timothy.  Above Top Secret: The Worldwide UFO Cover-Up. New
    York: William Morrow, 1988. 592pp.  ISBN 0-688-07860-5.  The most
    important book about the on-going government cover-up.

    Good, Timothy.  Alien Liaison: The Ultimate Secret. London: Century,
    1991. 242pp.  ISBN 0-7126-2194-6.  A reliable introduction to the
    wilder tales circulating in the UFO subculture in the 70s, 80s, and
    90s. The bizarre nature of what is known makes a prudent
    investigator reluctant to throw out any information. Some of this
    will turn out to be true after it is put through the academic mill in
    the 1990s and beyond. Not for the timid or intellectually rigid.

    Haines, Richard F., ed.  UFO Phenomena and the Behavioral Scientist.
    Metuchen, N.J.: The Scarecrow Press, 1979. 450pp.  ISBN 0-8108-
    1228-2.  Scholarly book of papers on how eyewitnesses report UFOs

    Sightings, Alien Encounters & Coverups. Santa Fe, NM: Aurora Press,
    1988. 381pp.  ISBN 0-943358-32-9.  A very good summary of the
    whole field of ufology. Highly recommended as a place to start.

    Evaluating, and Reporting UFO Sightings. Garden City, NY: Doubleday
    (Dolphin), 1979. 297pp. ISBN 0-385-14348-6.  The best study of the
    subject.  About 1300 UFO reports, all happening within the year and a half of
    the study's duration, are dissected.  8.6% fall into the genuine UFOs
    category, that is, essentially flying saucers, whatever they are!

    Hopkins, Budd.  Intruders: The Incredible Visitations at Copley
    Woods. New York: Random House, 1987. 223pp.  ISBN 0-394-56076-0.
    HopkinsU second book.  He says it is likely that aliens are mixing our
    genes with theirs, and this is a major purpose of the abductions.

    Littleton, CO: Linda Moulton Howe Productions, 1989. 455pp.  ISBN 0-
    9620570-1-0.  Best book of surprisingly few considering the 25
    year history of animal mutilations.

    Holroyd, Stuart.  Alien Intelligence.  New York: Everest House, 1979.
    231pp.  ISBN 0-89696-040-4.  An excellent book by a student of the
    paranormal that compares the different kinds of intelligence,
    including ET intelligence and "disembodied" intelligence.

    Abductions. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1992. 336pp.  ISBN 0-671-
    74857-2.  The most important book on UFO abductions so far. Start
    here because the presentation is a just the facts, ma'am, blow by
    blow account of what Jacobs believes is happening. He says
    essential aspects of all abductions are absolutely real in ordinary
    perceptual and space-time reality. However, there are definite
    perceptual and space-time anomalies too. When people report that
    they had a missing time experience of two hours, Jacobs says they
    are actually bodily missing from planet Earth, or at least human
    beings cannot find them on Earth! A warning to  extreme skeptics and
    debunkers: this book may be hazardous to your mental health!

    Jacobs, David Michael.  The UFO Controversy in America.
    Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1975. 362pp.  ISBN 0-
    253-19006-1.  A historian's review of ufology up to the date of

    Flying Objects. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1973. 322pp.  Keyhoe says

    Experiences of Eduard Meier. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1987.
    265pp.  ISBN 0-87113-139-0.  Easy introduction to the complex

    sense of it all, well, some small portion, anyway.

    Lorenzen, Coral and Jim Lorenzen.  Flying Saucer Occupants. New
    York: New American Library (Signet), 1967. 215pp.  One of many

    Noyes, Ralph, ed.  The Crop Circle Enigma: Grounding the Phenomenon
    in Science, Culture and Metaphysics. Bath, UK: Gateway Books, 1990.
    192pp.  ISBN 0-946551-66-9. More facts and speculation about the
    "agriglyphs".

    Randle, Kevin D. and Donald R. Schmitt.  UFO Crash at Roswell. New
    York: Avon, 1991. 327pp.  ISBN 0-380-76196-3. The authors don't
    back down. They say they have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that
    a flying saucer -- not a UFO -- crashed in NM in the summer of 1947.
    Get off your duff.  Prove them wrong!

    Investigated. London: Robert Hale, 1988. 240pp.  ISBN 0-7090-3276-

    South) American  phenomenon.

    Bentwaters NATO Air Base. New Brunswick, NJ: Global
    Communications, 1991. 192pp.  ISBN 0-938294-08-3.  Randles

    AF's Project Blue Book public relations UFO effort. "Brand New
    Enlarged Edition Latest, Up-to-the-minute Facts on UFO!" on dust
    jacket.  No indication whatsoever inside the new edition that it
    differs from the earlier edition by the addition of three extra
    (debunking) chapters.  Without the dust jacket you would never know
    there are two distinct editions of this classic UFO book.  Some UFO
    researchers speculate that the Air Force/CIA was displeased enough
    with Ruppelt's pro-UFO first edition that they made him include the
    last three chapters in the "new edition"!

    Imagination. New York: Addison-Wesley, 1991. 283pp.  ISBN 0-201-
    55084-9.  A minor lay scholar of the Jungian school takes on the
    UFO. His history of the field should be read by all UFO investigators.
    He suspects there might be a "real" component to UFOs, but his
    emphasis is on the mythic aspects, which may be more important in
    the final analysis anyway.

    Vallee, Jacques.  Confrontations: A Scientist's Search for Alien
    Contact. New York: Ballantine Books, 1990. 263pp.  ISBN 0-345-
    36453-8. Vallee is back to presenting "hard evidence" again instead
    of speculation. Some Brazilian peasants were killed in apparent
    encounters with UFOs.

    Vallee, Jacques.  Dimensions: A Casebook of Alien Contact. New York:
    Contemporary Books, 1988. 304pp.  ISBN 0-8092-4586-8. The best
    statement of Vallee's thesis -- UFOs are a manifestation of a time
    immemorial alien control system.

    Vallee, Jacques.  Messengers of Deception: UFO Contacts and Cults.
    Berkeley, CA: And/Or Press, 1979. 243pp.  ISBN 0-915904-38-1. Just
    what the title says. Vallee adds to our understanding of the cultural
    effects of UFOs.

    Vallee, Jacques.  Passport to Magonia: From Folklore to Flying
    Saucers. Chicago: Henry Regnery, 1969. 372pp.  ISBN 0-8092-8330-1.
    A study of the surprising parallels between fairy lore and modern
    accounts of UFO beings.

    Vallee, Jacques.  UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union: A Cosmic
    Samizdat. New York: Ballantine Books, 1992. 212pp.  ISBN 0-345-
    37396-0.  Vallee turns away from excessive American ufologist bashing to
    give us a reasonable rundown on the latest in Russian UFOs and
    ufology. It's been as bad over there as it has been elsewhere. The
    aliens seem to be equal opportunity abusers the world over.
