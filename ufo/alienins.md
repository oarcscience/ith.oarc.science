                         Alien Insurance Pays Off

                             By DAVID WALMSEY
                                 in London


        IT could be the perfect case for agents Mulder and Scully.

        In true X-Files style, an electrician claims he was lifted from
      the ground and knocked unconscious by a UFO near London.

        He is apparently to be paid $2 million by insurers who covered
      him against abduction by aliens.  Industry sources, however, are
      suggesting that the payout could, just possibly, be an out-of-
      this-world publicity stunt.

        The story starts on October 8 when Joseph Carpenter, 23, of
      North London, claims he was struck down by a mystery light at
      Swindon.

        The area is a "hot spot" for such phenomena, says Mr Carpenter,
      who runs a UFO hunting group called the Majestic Twelve.

        "On the evening in question, an intense beam of light, like a
      police helicopter, had me," he said.

        "The anti-gravity force within it lifted me above the ground.
      I passed out as I went directly into it.  All this was captured on
      film."

        By an amazing stroke of luck, Mr Carpenter had paid $205 for
      cover against such an eventuality to a company called GRIP, run by
      insurance broker Simon Burgess.

        Mr Carpenter was able to produce "compelling evidence" of his
      ordeal, including camcorder footage, witnesses and DNA samples
      taken from what he said was a claw found at the scene.

        Mr Burgess said last night: "The work on the DNA sample was
      carried out by a research fellow at Cambridge University -- I
      can't give you the name.  But the work proved conclusively that
      the sample was something that had never been seen before and which
      was not of this Earth."

        Mr  Burgess says Mr Carpenter was expected to receive his $2
      million yesterday at a London hotel from Scully herself, _X-Files_
      star Gillian Anderson.

        The broker, described by one industry source as "an unhelpful
      maverick", is believed to have made a deal with a Sunday paper for
      exclusive coverage of the presentation.

        Industry insiders say he is almost certain to make a profit from
      Mr Carpenter's claim.

        One said: "If he plays his cards right, he will claw the money
      back by wisely selling the world rights of the video evidence to
      TV companies.  If he co-wrote a book using the evidence, the money
      would also roll in."
