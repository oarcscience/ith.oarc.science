    "UFO Reality Is Breaking Out"  by  Richard J. Boylan, Ph.D.
    Part Eight
            A prestigious three-day international conference was held at the
    Sheraton washington in Washington, D.C. on May 27-29, 1995 on the subject of
    what should be Earth's proper response, when it comes out in the open that we
    are being visited by cultures from elsewhere.  The "When Cosmic Cultures Meet"
    International Conference featured presentations by scientists, academics,
    governmental spokespersons, research professionals, military officers,
    journalists and religious spokespersons. This world-class conference revealed
    the solid acceptance by political, academic, scientific and journalism figures
    of the realism of preparing for extraterrestrial contact. I also provided a
    number of compelling statements and revelations.
            Arlington Institute National Security expert John L. Petersen compared
    the current shift in society and culture,involving dramatic breakthroughs in
    energy sources, ET contact, and technology, to the shift from the Middle Ages
    to the Enlightenment.
            Anthropologist-journalist Michael Hesseman likened ET contact to a
    second Copernican Revolution. He also reported that Soviet KGB UFO files have
    now become public,, revealing, for example, that in 1989 a UFO hovered for two
    hours over a Soviet nuclear weapons storage facility, until finally a MIG
    fighter came and the UFO departed.
            Harvard psychiatrist Dr. John Mack presented arresting videotapes of
    his interviewing of Southern Africa fourth graders who witnessed a UFO set down
    at the edge of their recess playground. Then several ETs emerged, one
    approaching within nine feet of one awe-struck schoolgirl as others watched.
            Washington Post journalist Ruth Montgomery related how she had received
    multiple reports about UFO reality from various military officers with whom she
    had spoken.
            The producer of Mexico's "Sixty Minutes" television documentary
    program, Jaime Maussan, showed extensive videotapes of UFOs over Mexican
    population centers. These videotapes showed structured craft, flotillas of
    UFOs, and a vertical column of UFOs inside a translucent plasma (?) field. The
    most intriguing footage was a nighttime shot of a hovering UFO over the ground
    near a villa, and later a "Praying Mantis"-type extraterrestrial with
    illumination on him is seen turning towards the videocamera from perhaps a
    half-block away.
            Sumerian culture expert Zecharia Sitchin presented evidence from
    ancient Sumerian tablets for previous contact between extraterrestrials and
    modern humans' ancestors.
            A research professionals panel including Dr. Leo Sprinkle, Dr. Richard
    Boylan and USAF Colonel Donald Ware  presented research evidence and
    conclusions about extraterrestrial visitation, the ETs' purposes, and about
    covert unauthorized attacks on human experiencers and upon UFOs by clandestine
    paramilitary units.
            The organizer of the Cosmic Cultures Conference, Dr. Scott Jones, has
    made videotapees of the Conference available to key Congressional and White
    House figures, so that they can be aware that representatives from the
    scientific, academic, professional and journalistic communities accept UFO
    reality.
