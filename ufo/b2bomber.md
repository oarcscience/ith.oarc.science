    THE B2 BOMBER:
    COULD IT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR BOOMERANG UFO SIGHTINGS?
    ======================================================

    Reports of boomerang-shaped UFO's are a permanent part of UFO
    records. Cases in point, the Hudson Valley sightings (documented
    in the book Night Siege- The Hudson Valley UFO sightings, by
    Philip J. Imbrogo and a sighting in Florida, April 1993.

    After doing a little digging, we cannot help but wonder if *some*
    of them might be attributed to the B2 Stealth bomber.

    The stealth fighter we all heard about during the Persian Gulf War
    was the Lockheed F-117. It first flew i 1981 and was used in
    combat during the Panama invasion and the Gulf War.

    The Northrop B2 Stealth Bomber first flew in 1989, and was not
    used in the Gulf War. It was developed with a specific mission
    in mind- to fly deep into Soviet territory and drop nuclear
    weapons on silos containing ICBMs. It was also supposed to hit
    the underground shelters that housed Soviet leaders. The B2 was
    also supposed to seek out and destroy Soviet mobile missile
    launchers such as SS24s and SS25s.

    The B2, essentially flying wing incorporating radar-defeating
    technology, has no pods to mount weapons. It goes into battle
    naked. Since it is said to be solely subsonic, it's an easy
    target if it is sighted visually by interceptors, particular
    since it does not have afterburners.

    The B2 is designed with few radar-reflecting surfaces. Engines,
    fuel tanks and weapons are inside the aircraft. Air for the
    engines comes from inlets on the top wing surface.

    Materials selected to defeat radar (radar absorbing materials)
    are used extensively. Carbon fiber, glass fiber and other
    composites are used heavily. And the glass canopy is coated with
    gold to prevent radar reflection off objects inside the cockpit.

    The specs for the B2 are:

    Builder:        Northrop Corp.
    Aircraft type:  Long rangestrategic bomber
    Engines:        Four General Electric F118-GE Turbofans.
                    Each delivers 19,000 pounds thrust.
    Length:         69 feet
    Height:         17 feet
    Wingspan:       172 feet
    Loaded weight:  376,000 pounds
    Speed:          Subsonic
    Range:          To 7,500 miles

    Some reports say boomerang-shaped UFOs "were as big as a football
    field". With a wingspan of 172 feet, we can't see how such errors
    in estimation of size could be made. Unless it was witnessed at
    tree-top level with no other objects to gage size.

    The Sirius Connection editors have seen USAF photos of the B2 in
    flight, and yes- it looks weird and a perfect candidate for a
    UFO sighting. Images of the B2 are available as .GIF images
    B2A.GIF and B2B.GIF in the free-to-all Browse Library of Sirius
    Connection. The images are not spectacular, but they are the only
    ones we have been able to track down.

    A few interesting questions arise now that the Soviet Union is
    no more. As of July 17, 1989 about $22 billion had been spent to
    produce the B2. The USAF was supposed to get 132 of them at $865
    million a copy. That was cut to 75 by the DOD in April of 1990.
    Additional budget cuts in the program reduced the number
    significantly. How many actually were built? Beyond the three
    known to exist in 1991, who knows?

    And with all all those variable wing surfaces, could it be that
    that the B2 has the ability to fly very slowly? Stall-speed data
    is not available. Boomerang-shaped UFO reports frequently mention
    that the objects can move slowly.

    And what of the future of the B2s? At $865 million a copy, it is
    not logical they would be scrapped, but rather used as flying
    test-beds for even more advanced technology.

    Hope this has helped shed some light on a possible cause of
    *some* of the boomerang-shaped UFO sightings.
