Point of information - this engagement was called the "Battle of Los
Angeles".  According to a memo by Gen. George C. Marshall, quoted in
Tim Good's book "Above Top Secret", 1,430 round of ack-ack fire (not
missiles) were discharged during the engagement.  The outlines of the
airborne objects could be made out.  Note that, if these were enemy
airplanes, they would have been downed in short order, especially with
that volume of ack-ack fire.  Instead, the shells merely exploded around
or detonated on the objects, without apparent harm.
