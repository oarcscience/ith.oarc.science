                            MEMORANDUM II

            An informant I call Beltway Throat (BT), who lives in the shadow of the
    power center of the world (Washington, D.C., in case you thought it was
    Sedona), reports on his recent interview with CHICKADEE of The Aviary, (the
    retired Naval Intelligence Commander C.B. Scott Jones, Ph.D.) Dr. Jones has
    provided BT with additional detail concerning events which The Aviary believe
    are upcoming.
            It seems that the predicted Extraterrestrial Landing on April 24, 1997
    is a precursor to a 1998 series of cataclysms. Furthermore, the 1997 Landing is
    the last chance for the Powers That Be (human governments) to allow their
    populations to know about extraterrestrial visitation; otherwise, the ETs will
    not be available to assist humankind in mitigating and surviving the 1998
    cataclysm series.
            BT says that the U.S. Power Structure is aware of the warnings about
    the 1998 cataclysm series.
            Massive human and planetary destruction is the default course; unless
    we (our governments) invite the ETs to appear openly on Earth, the ETs will not
    be able to prevent/mitigate the 1998 cataclysm series. The ETs want to be
    invited in a peaceful way. They are not going to forcefully impose themselves
    on us.
            BT was not detailed about the nature of the 1998 cataclysm series,
    except to say that it is composed of events partially of technological origin
    and partially of natural causes. When I suggested that the cataclysm series
    could include massive seismic upheavals, increased volcanism, global-warming
    weather extremes and enlarging ozone-hole radiation effects, BT did not dispute
    that view.
            Dr. Jones' opinion is reportedly that the resistance to admitting
    extraterrestrial visitation is significant in the Developed Countries, but that
    The Aviary worries especially about tyrants in Third World countries who would
    violently resist the threat to the status quo (theirs) presented by open
    acknowledgment of extraterrestrial presence.
            Commander Jones reportedly offered two scenarios of how The Aviary
    would deal with the alleged extraterrestrial landing on 04/27/97. Scenario One
    would have a coalition of Insiders (the "MJ-12" leadership, the Aviary, and Las
    Vegas billionaire Robert Bigelow's NIDS Institute) constitute an elite Contact
    Group, who would be self-appointed as Earth's representatives, and negotiate
    with the extraterrestrials during the Landing. (BT did not identify what NIDS
    stood for, and laughed when I humorously suggested NIDS stood for NSA
    Intelligence Disinformation School.) I strongly protested that such an elist
    approach would be repudiated by both humans and the extraterrestrials.
            BT said that Scenario Two would be that a "blue-ribbon panel" be set up
    as the Contact Team to negotiate between ETs and humans. I emphasized, in
    response, that such a blue-ribbon panel would need to be broadly representative
    of the peoples of Earth, and should be democratically selected with world-wide
    membership, such as the U.N. could do. BT sounded diffident that the U.N. would
    undertake such an effort.
            BT said that Dr. Jones shared the rumor that Christ was an ET, and that
    the returning ETs might present the Christ Consciousness figure to the
    christian world. Christians, in turn, might become so taken with the returning
    Christ event that they ignore taking direction from their governmental leaders,
    thus leading to social chaos. I pointed out to BT that the original Christ
    avoided getting involved in the secular government of his day, and advised
    people to "render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's",
    i.e., acknowledged that government had its place.
            Beltway Throat said that the rumor is that Bob Bigelow's NIDS Institute
    has a UFO artifact, and will be bringing that into public view as an
    attention-getting device, to make the public focus on the UFO/ET phenomenon.
    There is the possibility, in my opinion, that such a waving around of a piece
    of a UFO could manipulate people into giving the MJ-12/Aviary/Bigelow NIDS
    Institute undue power to negotiate with the Extraterrestrials.
            That is the Aviary's [dis-?]informational report for now. As always,
    use your own personal good judgment and discernment.
