                             -=> Quoted from SETI <=-

    In 1961, radio astronomer Frank Drake presented the following equation
    to a conference of scientists gathered to discuss the search for
    intelligent life in the milky way galaxy.  That conference, and other
    discussions like it, eventually led to SETI, the search for
    extra-terrestrial intelligence.

    N = (R*) (fp) (ne) (fl) (fj) (fc) (L)

    N = Number of communicating civilizations from the void, the product of
        the following seven factors.  The Drake equation presents a range
        for N between 100 and 100,000.

    R* = Rate of starbirths.  It is conjectured that an average of ten stars
         is believed to form each year in the lifetime of the galaxy; the
         value of for R* is 10.

    f.p = Star with planets it is believed all stars develop a system of
          planets, setting the value of f.p at 1.

    n.e = Planets with life-supporting environments.  It was accepted that
          each star system has a likelihood of producing an average of one
          inhabitable planet, setting the value of n.e. at 1.

    f.l = Planets with life.  It is assumed that all planets capable of
          supporting life with eventually possess it.  Making the value of
          f.l at 1.

    f.i = Intelligent life.  Estimates suggest that life will evolve to
          setience on 10% of the planets with life, thus setting f.i at 1.

    f.c = Communicating societies.  Variable possibilities for the proper
          technologies and a willingness to send messages are estimated at
          roughly 10%; the value for f.c was set at 1.

    L = Civilization life span.  The length of time during which an
        advanced, intelligent civilization may broadcast is limited by the
        amount of time, in years, it exists; the value for L ranges from
        1,000 to 1,000,000,000.

    In the silence of dead monitors, the hardcopy hums into trays, signal
    after signal from the chaos, the various voices are collected, and after
    the final signal, one can listen and wait for the encoded call of the
    void...
