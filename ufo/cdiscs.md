Interesting Theory of Crashed Discs 12,000 Years Ago
====================================================

High in the mountains of BayanKara-Ula, on the borders of China
and Tibet - a team of archaeologists were conducting a very
detailed routine survey of a series of interlinked caves.

Their interests had been excited by the discovery of lines of
neatly arranged graves which contained the skeletons of what
must have been a strange race of human beings; strange because
they had unnaturally spindly bodies and large, overdeveloped
heads.

At first, it had been thought that the caves had been the home
of a hitherto unknown species of ape. But as the leader of the
team - the Chinese archeologist, Professor Chi Pu Tei - pointed
out, "Who ever heard of apes burying each other?"

It was while studying the skeletons that one of the team
stumbled on a large, round stone disk, half buried in the dust
on the floor of the cave.

The team gathered round the discovery, turning it this way and
that.It looked, absurdly, like a kind of 'Stone Age Gramophone
record'. There was a hole in the centre and a fine, spiral
groove radiated to the rim.

Closer inspection, however, showed that the groove was, in fact,
a continuous spiralling line of closely written characters.

The object was a 'record' ... in more ways then one. Only nobody
at the time - the year was 1938 - possessed the key to its
incredible message. The disc was labeled and filed away among
other finds in the area. Even those who knew of its existence
knew nothing of its meaning.

Many experts tried to translate the hieroglyphics in the 20
years the disc languished in Peking. They all failed. It was not
until another professor Dr. Tsum Um Nui broke the code and
started to decipher the 'speaking grooves' that the
extraordinary implications of the disc were realized.

Realized, that is, only by only a select few. The outside world
remained in ignorance. For the professor's conclusions on the
meaning of the disc were so shattering that they were officially
suppressed. The Peking Academy of Pre-History forbade him to
publish his findings.

Two years later, in 1965, the professor and four of his
colleagues were finally given permission to reveal their theory.
It appeared under the longwinded but intriguing title, "The
Grooved Script concerning Space-ships which, as recorded on the
Discs, landed on Earth 12,000 years ago".

The 'records' - 716 of the grooved discs were later uncovered in
the same caves - told an astonishing story of a 'space probe' by
the inhabitants of another planet which came to grief in the
Bayan-Kara-Ula mountain range.

The strange, spiral script told how the peaceful intentions of
the 'aliens' had been misunderstood and how many of them were
hunted down and killed by members of the Ham tribe, who lived in
the neighboring caves.

According to Tsum Um Nui, one of the lines of the hieroglyphics
read, "The Dropas came down from the clouds in their aircraft.
Our men, women and children hid in the caves ten times before
sunrise. When at last they understood the sign language of the
Dropas, they realized that the newcomers had peaceful intentions."

Another section expressed 'regret' by the Ham tribe that the
aliens' spaceship had crash-landed in such a remote and
inaccessible mountains and that there had been no way to
building a new one to enable Dropas to return to their own
planet.

In the years since the discovery of the first disc,
archaeologists and anthropologists had learned more about the
isolated Bayan-Kara-Ula area.And much of the information seemed
to corroborate the bizarre story recorded on the discs.

Legend still preserved in the area spoke of small, gaunt, yellow
faced men who 'came from the clouds, long, long ago'. The men
had huge, bulging heads and puny bodies and were so ugly and
repellent that they were hounded down by local tribesmen on
horseback. Strangely, the description of the 'invaders' tallied
with the skeletons originally discovered in the caves by
Professor Chi Pu Tei.

On the walls of the caves themselves archaeologists had
uncovered crude pictures of the rising Sun, the Moon,
unidentifiable stars and the Earth...all joined together by
lines of pea-sized dots. Along with the discs, the cave drawings
had been dated around 12,000 years old.

The cave area was still inhabited by two semi-troglodyte tribes
known as the Hams and the Dropas, themselves extremely odd in
appearance. The frail and stunted tribesmen averaged only about
five feet in height and were neither typically Chinese nor
Tibetan. "Their racial back-ground," said one expert, "is a
mystery."

But even with the publications of Professor Tsum Um Nui's
amazing translation, the story of the 'space discs' was not over.
Russian scientists asked to see the discs and several were sent
to Moscow for examination.

They were scraped free of rock particles which had stuck to them
and then put through chemical analysis. To the surprise of the
scientists, they we found to contain large amounts of cobalt and
other metallic substances.

That was not all. When placed on a special turntable - according
to Dr.Vyatcheslav Saizev, who described the experiments in the
Soviet magazine Sputnik - they vibrated or 'hummed' in an
unusual rhythm as though an electric charge was passing through
them. Or as one scientist suggested, "as if they formed some
part of an electrical circuit." At some time, they had clearly
been exposed to extraordinarily high voltages.
