<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">German Hacker foiled</H2>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">For Immediate Release</H3>
<P>
During the month of March, 2002, a denial of service attack was
conducted by a German hacker against Intangible Textual Heritage.
Intangible Textual Heritage is site based in Santa Cruz, California
which has a wide spectrum of religious texts,
and promotes religious tolerance.</P>

<P>
The hacker, Robert M&uuml;cke, a student at the Freie Universitaet of Berlin,
conducted a series of denial of service attacks against the Internet
Sacred Text Archive (ith.oarc.science),
between March 13 and 23.
The hacker used a machine in the universities' physics department.</P>

<P>
A denial of service attack is when a program is used to download the
pages at a website repeatedly.
By overloading the web server, legitimate users of the site are prevented
from accessing it.</P>

<P>
The hacker was downloading the entire site an average of twice a day.
The attacks peaked on March 17th, when 61% of the hits at the site
were from the hackers' machine.  On that day the hacker transferred
over a gigabyte of material from sacred-texts, downloading the site
five times over.</P>

<P>No customer information was accessed or stolen by the hacker, as
it is not kept at the site.
The hacker simply downloaded the entire site, over and over, to
prevent people from reading it.</P>

<P>
&quot;The first thing I knew, sales of the Intangible Textual Heritage CD-ROM just dropped
dead for two weeks.&quot; said Mr J.B. Hare, administrator of the site.
&quot;I had just shipped a new version, which had drawn a lot of interest,
and I was mystified as to why it wasn't selling.&quot;
The mystery was solved when sales picked up after the hacker stopped
bombarding sacred-texts.
&quot;Customers will leave a site if the response time is slow, which
is exactly what a denial of service attack does.&quot;
said Mr. Hare.
</P>

<P>
Mr Hare started examining the site logs.
These are files which record each request for pages at
the website.
A massive number of hits were arriving
from a machine named 'broiler.physik.fu-berlin.de'.
Mr. Hare contacted the system administrators at fu-berlin.de.
The Freie Universitaet of Berlin
promptly barred the hacker from using the computer from which the attacks
were conducted, ending the problem.</P>

<P>M&uuml;cke sent an email to the administrator of Intangible Textual Heritage stating
in part:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I surely can not agree with to mix up
all the pagan cults, idols, witchcrafts (6. & 7. book of "Moses"),
esoteric, ocullt, theosophic and even satanic views and the God that
created heaven and earth that hates these former things with one another
without distinction. I am probably not the first who tells you this, but
also not the last. God will be last one for sure. There would be no
martyrs Fox could have been writing about, and no John Bunyan suffering
persecution and writing such precious allegories about the way and fight
of believers towards Heaven, if these people of former generations had
such relativistic view of truth that comes more and more common today,
that calls evil good and good evil.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>&quot;The site usually gets very a positive response, and I get
emails from people of all faiths saying that it is a valuable resource.&quot;
Mr. Hare said.
&quot;Unfortunately, there are also a lot of people who don't like
the idea of religious tolerance and are willing to go to any extreme
to quash it.  I'm just glad the whole episode is over.&quot;
