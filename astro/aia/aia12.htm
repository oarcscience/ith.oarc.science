<p><i>Name</i>.--After the Sun succeedeth Venus.</p>  
<p><i>Colour in the Element</i>.--She is of a bright, shining colour, and is well known by the name of the evening star, or Hesperus; and that is when she appears after the Sun is set; she is commonly called the morning star, but by the learned Lucifer, when she is seen long before the rising of the Sun. Her mean motion is 59 minutes and 8 seconds; her diurnal motion is sometimes 62 minutes a-day, and 82 minutes she never exceeds. Her greatest latitude is 9&deg; 2'. She is retrograde 42 days, and stationary 2. Her year is 224 days and 7 hours.</p>  
<p><i>Element</i>.--She is a feminine planet, temperately cold and moist; nocturnal, the lesser fortune, author of mirth and cheerfulness.</p>  
<p><i>Manners and Quality when well dignified</i>.--She signifies a quiet man, not given to law, quarrel, or wrangling; not vicious; pleasant, neat and spruce, loving mirth in his words and actions, cleanly in apparel, rather drinking much than gluttonous; prone to venery, often entangled in love matters, zealous in their affections, musical, delighting in baths and all honest merry meetings, or amusements and theatricals; easy of belief, and not given to labour, or take any pains; a company keeper, cheerful, nothing mistrustful, a right virtuous man or woman, often jealous, yet without cause.</p>  
<p><i>When ill dignified</i>. Then he is riotous, expensive, wholly given to dissipation and lewd companies of women, nothing regarding his reputation, coveting unlawful beds, incestuous,</p>

<p><i>Oriental</i>.--When oriental, the body inclines to tallness or a kind of upright straightness in person; not corpulent or very tall, but neatly composed; a right Venus person is a pretty, complete, handsome man or woman.</p>
