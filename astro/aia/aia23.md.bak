### CHAPTER XX.

### WHAT SIGNIFICATOR, QUERENT, AND QUESITED, ARE; AND AN INTRODUCTION TO THE JUDGMENT OF A QUESTION.

THE querent is he or she that propounds the question and desires
resolution; the quesited is he or she, or the thing sought and inquired
after.

The significator is no more than that planet which rules the house that
signifies the person or thing demanded; as if ♈

is ascending, ♂ being lord of ♈, shall be significator of the querent,
viz. the sign ascending shall in part signify his corporature, body, or
stature: the lord of the ascendant, according to the sign he is in, the
☽ and planet in the ascendant, equally mixed together, shall shew his
quality or conditions; so that let any sign ascend, what planet is lord
of that sign shall be called lord of the house, or significator of the
person inquiring, &c.

So that, in the first place, when any question is propounded, the sign
ascending and his lord are always given unto him or her that asks the
question.

Secondly: You must then consider the matter propounded, and see to which
of the twelve houses it does properly belong: when you have found the
house, consider the sign and lord of that sign, how, and in what sign
and what part of heaven he is placed, how dignified, what aspect he has
to the lord of the ascendant, who impedites your significator, who is a
friend unto him, viz. what planet it is, and what house he is lord of,
or in what house posited; from such a man or woman signified by that
planet shall you be aided or hindered, or by one of such relation unto
you as that planet signifies; if lord of such a house, such an enemy; if
lord of a house that signifies enemies, then an enemy verily; if of a
friendly house, a friend.

The whole natural key of astrology rests in the words preceding, rightly
understood. By the examples following, I shall make all things more
plain; for I do not desire or will reserve any thing whereby the learner
may be kept in suspense of understanding what is useful for him, and
most fit to be known. In every question we do give the ☽ as a
consignificator with the querent or lord of the ascendant. Having well
considered the several applications and separation of the lords of those
houses signifying your questions, as also

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

the ☽, her situation and quality of the aspects she has, and each
significator has to each, you may begin to judge and consider whether
the thing demanded will come to pass, yea or nay; by what or whose
means, the time when, and whether it will be good for the querent to
proceed further in his demands. yea or nay.
