# PREFACE.

AFTER a lapse of 205 years since the first publication, in 1647, of
*Lilly's Introduction to Astrology*, there would be no necessity for an
apology for its re-appearance, were it not for the prevailing fashion of
the day, which is to rail at and vituperate that science, and all who
dare to say a word, not in its favour, but in favour of examining into
its merits, with a view to ascertain what were the grounds on which our
honest ancestors believed, and strictly followed, that which we conceive
only fit for ridicule. As I have long outlived the days when I, like
many others, thought myself at liberty to laugh at, and condemn, what I
did not understand; the world will forgive me if I be bold enough to
advise those who value truth, to spend a few days (and but a few days
will be necessary) in examining the principles laid down in this work,
and applying them to their own individual cases, before they join the
herd of learned and

<span id="page_iv">p. iv</span>

unlearned in pledging their words to a false assertion, viz. that
Astrology is an unfounded science. If any man will take the trouble to
examine for himself, and should find that the prejudices of his
education against the science of foreseeing the future, and many other
matters which it teaches, are in reality well-founded, and that it has
no claims to truth, then will he have the proud satisfaction of knowing,
that his opinions on a matter of some consequence are based on
experiment, and are the result of his own conviction, not of another
person's assertion. On the other hand, if he find truth flash with
lightning force upon his mind, and convince him that Astrology,
notwithstanding prejudice and abuse, is founded in nature, and is indeed
a noble science, given by a benevolent Creator to enlighten man in his
wanderings, and enable him to shun the vice and folly which his passions
throw in his path; then will he, if a spark of piety exist within his
breast, offer thanks to that Creator for the blessing he has discovered.
In either case, he must admit that I do him a service in putting forth
this plain and simple means of discovering the truth.

This is "the age of enquiry;" and yet prejudice continues to press down
her leaden foot upon the neck of examination in this matter. I can only
attribute the

<span id="page_v">p. v</span>

pitiable fact to the circumstance of there being no recent publications
on those parts of Astrology which are the most easily acquired. The art
of *Nativities* requires many years of patient experimenting before it
can be well understood, and practised with certainty and satisfaction.
The art of *Atmospherical Astrology*, and also that of *Mundane
Astrology*, alike demand much time to penetrate their arcana, and a good
education to follow their practice. Hence we may account for their
comparatively confined study: few have either the abilities or the
opportunity to wrestle with their difficulties.

But *Horary Astrology*, the chief subject in this work. may be speedily
learned by any person of even moderate abilities; and may, as far as
regards its elementary difficulties, be mastered in a few days' study.
It may be well understood, and reduced to constant practice in less than
a quarter of a year, and no one will find himself at a loss for
occasions to test its reality or its utility; for his own avocations,
and the affairs of his friends, will offer these almost daily. If a
proposition of *any nature* be made to any individual, about the result
of which he is anxious, and therefore uncertain whether to accede to it
or not, let him but note the hour and minute when it was *first* made,
and erect a figure of the heavens, as herein taught, and his doubts will
be instantly resolved.

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

\[paragraph continues\] He may thus, in five minutes, learn infallibly
whether the affair will succeed or not; and, consequently, whether it is
prudent to adopt the offer made or not. If he examine the sign on the
1st house of the figure, the planet therein, or the planet ruling the
sign, *will exactly describe the party making the offer*, both in person
and character; and this may at once convince the inquirer for truth of
the reality of the principles of the science.

Moreover, the descending sign, &c. will *describe his own person and
character*; a farther proof of the truth of the science, if he require
it. Here, then, is a ready test of the *truth* of Astrology. Will its
adversaries dare to make its application? It would, methinks, be better
than relaxing the broad muscles, which ever denote ignorance and
surprise, the feelings which, combined are the undoubted source of
laughter; the only argument of the idiot, the ready resource of the
ignorant.

In editing this work, my chief object has been to render it useful to
the student in Astrology and so, by forwarding the science, to promote
the general interests of humanity.

With this view I have re-written those parts of the work which modern
discoveries in Astronomy and Astrology have rendered obsolete. *Tables
for calculating* 

<span id="page_vii">p. vii</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *Nativities* and a *Grammar of Astrology* are
adjoined, and every ingredient of the science given which the student is
likely to require.

As regards the deviations I have made from the rules of the author, they
are few, and founded on much experience. I have omitted his chapters on
nativities, as in that part of the science he was less perfect than in
any other; the reason being that he relied on essential dignities, which
are, by my experience, of little, if any, avail. The rules for
calculating arcs of direction will be found in the *Grammar*.

In conclusion, I have no desire to offend any class of men by putting
forth this work: I do not know whether I should not respect even
prejudice, for the sake of peace, were it not that I cannot
conscientiously consent to abandon truth in the effort. I am callous to
the puny efforts of critics who may desire to pour on me the waters of
vituperation or ridicule, having already passed through a flood. After
many years' experience, I have found the laws of Astrology unfailing;
and as I can discover no prohibition of its practice in the Word of God,
I am prepared to defend it against all the foolish attacks of those who
falsely declare that it upholds fatality, or is opposed to the
providence or the revelation of the Deity. And I am contented, with
God's blessing,

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

to give up the ghost in the firm persuasion, that, in Maintaining what I
believe is the truth in this respect, I shall meet, hereafter, through
the goodness of God and the merits of my Saviour, with a merciful
judgment.

I am, reader, your devoted friend and well-wisher in all science which
may honour trod and benefit mankind.

ZADKIEL.
