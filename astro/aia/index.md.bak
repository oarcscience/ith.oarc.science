# An Introduction to Astrology

## by William Lilly

### Zadkiel, ed.

#### \[1852\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

First published in 1647, as Christian Astrology, this is one of the best
known post-classical works on Astrology. the present edition, heavily
edited by 'Zadkiel,' was released under the current title in 1852. As
the planet Uranus ('Hershel'), discovered in 1781, is mentioned
throughout, and Neptune, discovered in 1846, is not, we can bracket the
date of composition of the revised edition to the mid-19th century.

Horary Astrology, the subject of this book, interprets planetary
positions to answer a wide range of questions, from lost dogs and stolen
fish, to the death of kings. While there is a basic repertoire of
interpretations, (e.g., Saturn bad, Venus good), the horoscope is used
as a jumping off point for the astrologer's intuition.

And Lilly apparently had spectacularly good intuition. His famous
prediction of the London fire of 1666 was so accurate that he was
suspected of starting it, a charge he was later acquitted of. Lilly also
used Astrology in medical practice and this book discusses the use of
horoscopes in diagnosing diseases, determining whether a patient will
die or get better, and so on.

Zadkiel was apparently the pseudonym of Richard James Morrison
(1795-1874). Thanks to John Mark Ockerbloom of Online Books for pointing
this out.
