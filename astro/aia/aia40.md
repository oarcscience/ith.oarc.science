# APPENDIX.

### EXPLANATION OF THE HIEROGLYPHICS.

THE first of these curious cuts, which have been exactly copied from our
author's tract, entitled "*Monarchy or no Monarchy in England*," is
intended to represent a great mortality, in which the vast number of
deaths should so far exceed the supply of coffins, that the dead must
needs be buried in their shrouds, or merely stitched up in sheets, &c.,
as therein rudely represented.--The second cut is an *Astrological*
Hieroglyphic, as may be understood by the horoscope being introduced
therein; and the two children or twins are intended to represent the
sign Gemini, which, in astrology, is known to rule London; and the twins
are, therefore, intended to denote that city. Their falling headlong
into the fire, describes the extensive injury to be done to London by
that element fifteen years afterwards. The manner in which this was
foreseen by the author has been explained in our remarks on his life.

These two Hieroglyphics, even if there had been only these, whereas
there were several others equally pointing out future events, published
with them, would ever remain undeniable monuments of our author's skill,
and of the substantial truth of the science of astrology.
