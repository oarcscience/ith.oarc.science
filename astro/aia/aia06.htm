<p>THE figure of the heavens being erected, it now remains to observe how the planets are situated as regards each other; or, in other words, how they are aspected. And, first,</p>  
<p>Of Zodiacal Aspects.</p>  
<p>These are as follow:--</p>  
<p><DIR>Semi &#10038;, a Semi-sextile, or 30 degrees.</p>  
<p>Semi &#9744;, a Semi-square, or 45 degrees.</p>  
<p>&#10038;, a Sextile, or 60 degrees.</p>  
<p>A Quintile, or distance of 72 degrees.</p>  
<p>&#9744;, a Square, or quartile, 90 degrees.</p>  
<p>&#9651;, a Trine, or distance of 120 degrees.</p>  
<p>A Sesquiquadrate, or square and a half, 135 degrees.</p>  
<p>A Biquintile, or double quintile, 144 degrees.</p>  
<p>&#9741; an Opposition, 180 degrees.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Good</i> aspects are the semi-sextile, sextile, quintile, trine, and biquintile.</p>  
<p><i>Evil</i> aspects are the semi-square, square, sesquiquadrate, and opposition.--N.B. The conjunction, marked thus &#9740;, is when two planets are in the same degree and minute of the zodiac: when it is exact, it is very powerful, and is called a <i>partile</i> &#9740;; but if within the planets' orbs, it is called a <i>platic</i> conjunction, and is less powerful. To know whether it should be considered at all, the orbs of the two planets should be added together, and one-half the sum taken; if the planets be beyond that distance, they are not even in platic &#9740;. The same holds good with regard to other aspects.</p>  
<p>The orbs of the cusps of the houses are 5&deg;, so that if A</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A></p>  
<p>planet be one-half its orb and 5&deg; more distant from a house, it is not in aspect to that house; the same if the <i>aspect</i> of the planet fall beyond that distance from the cusp of any other house.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Orbs of the Planets</i>.</p>  
<p>&#9796;, 9&deg;; &#9795;, 9&deg;; &#9794;, 7&deg;; &#9737;, 15, &#9792;, 7&deg;; &#9791; 7&deg;; &#9789;, 12&deg;.--N.B. &#9797; has had no orb of operation discovered; but I think it may safely be considered as 7&deg; in all horary figures, &amp;c.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Of Mundane Aspects</i>.</p>  
<p>These are formed by the houses in horary astrology, and by the semi-arcs of the planets in nativities. Thus, a semi &#10038; is 1 house; a semi &#9744;, 1&frac12;; a &#10038;, 2 houses; a &#9744;, 3 houses; a &#9651;, 4 houses; a sesqui &#9651;, 4&frac12; houses; and an &#9741;, 6 houses.</p>  
<p>The &#8531; of a semi arc is a semi &#10038;; the &frac12; of a semi-arc is a semi &#9744;; the &#8532; of a semi-arc is a &#10038;; the whole semi-arc is a &#9744;; and 1-5th less than the semi-arc is a quintile; the whole semi-arc and &#8531; more is a &#9651;; the whole semi-arc and &frac12; more is a sesqui &#9744;; the one-tenth part of a semi-arc added to a sesqui &#9744;, is a biquintile.--N.B. The entire arc of a planet, or double the semi-arc, will not give the measure of its distance from the opposite point of its place; but if the two semi-arcs of a planet, both diurnal and nocturnal, be added together, they make 180&deg;, an opposition aspect.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Of Parallels</i>.</p>  
<p>The Zodiacal Parallel is when two planets have the same amount of declination from the equator. It is the most powerful of all aspects, but is not generally used in horary astrology.</p>  
<p>The Mundane Parallel is an equal distance from the meridian. It is used by some horary astrologers. When any of the above aspects are formed between the planets, they are</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_26"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 26</FONT></A></p>  
<p>found to have a mutual influence or action on each other; according to the nature of the aspect. For example: if the &#9737; be 60 degrees (a &#10038;) from &#9795; in any figure, it <i>denotes</i> that the person signified by the Sun is under the benefit influence of the benevolent &#9795;; and <i>shews</i> success according to the nature of the question. In nativities it <i>causes</i> good health and good fortune in life. But if &#9737; be 90 degrees (a &#9744;) from &#9796;, it <i>shews</i> discredit, a failure of hopes, &amp;c. in a question; and in a nativity it produces much sickness to the native, and also misfortunes to his father. This was verified in the nativity of Napoleon Bonaparte's son, who was born at 9h. 15m. A.M. 20th March, 1811, when &#9737; was in 28&deg; 53'&deg; of &#9811;, and &#9796; was in 26&deg; 28' of &#9808;; just 92&deg; 25 distant from each other. This very close &#9744; aspect of &#9737; and &#9796; caused great trouble to the native, through his father's misfortunes; and, &#9737; was the hyleg, produced a consumptive disease, and early death. It is remarkable, that his father's troubles began immediately after his birth; and it will always be found in the nativity of a child, that the fortune of its parents may be ascertained thereby until the birth of another child. If, for example, the child have evil planets in the fourth house, its father will be more or less-unfortunate until the birth of another child; when, if that other have &#9795; and &#9792; in the fourth house, the father's affairs will become more fortunate: so very beautifully do the nativities of parents and their children sympathise together.</p>
