### CHAPTER XXI.

### TO KNOW WHETHER A THING DEMANDED WILL BE BROUGHT TO PERFECTION, YEA OR NAY.

THE ancients have delivered unto us, that there are four ways or means
which discover whether a person's question demanded shall be
accomplished, yea or nay.

*Conjunction*.--First, by conjunction: when therefore you find the lord
of the ascendant, and the lord of that house which signifies the thing
demanded, hastening to a ☌, and in the first house, or in any *angle*,
and the significators meet with no prohibition or refranation, before
they come to perfect ☌, you may then judge that the thing sought after
shall be brought to pass without any manner of let or impediment; the
sooner, if the significators be swift in motion, and essentially or
accidentally strong; but if this ☌ of the significators be in a
*succeedent* house, it will be perfected, but not so soon; if in
*cadent* houses, with infinite loss of time, some difficulty, and much
struggling.

*Aspects of* ✶ *or* △.--Things are also effected, when the principal
signifiers apply by ✶ or △ aspect out of good houses and places where
they are essentially well dignified, and meet with no malevolent aspect
to intervene ere they come to be in perfect ✶ or △.

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

*Aspects of* ☐ *and* ☍.--Things are also produced to perfection when the
significators apply by ☐ aspect, provided each planet have dignity in
the degrees wherein they are, and apply out of proper and good houses;
otherwise not. Sometimes it happens that a matter is effected when the
significators apply by ☍, but it is when there is mutual *reception* by
*house*, and out of friendly houses, and the ☽ separating from the
significator of the thing demanded, and applying presently to the lord
of the ascendant. I have seldom seen any thing drought to perfection by
this way of opposition, but the querent had been better the thing had
been undone; for, if the question was concerning marriage, the parties
seldom agreed, but were ever wrangling and disputing, each party
repining at his evil choice, laying the blame upon their covetous
parents, as having no mind to it themselves; and if the question was
about portion or monies, the querent did, it is true, recover his money
or portion promised, but it cost him more to procure it in suit of law
than the debt was worth; and so have I seen it happen in many other
things, &c.

*Translation*.--Things are brought to perfection by *translation* of
light and nature, in this manner:--When the significators both of
querent and quesited are separating from ☌, or ✶, or △ aspects of each
other, and some other planet separates himself from one of the
significators, of whom he is received, either by house, triplicity, or
term, <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md) and then this planet applies
to the other significator by ☌ or aspect, before he meets with the ☌ or
aspect of any other planets; he thus translates the force, influence,
and virtue of the first significator to the other, and then this
intervening planet, (or such a man or woman as is signified by that
planet,) shall bring the matter in hand to perfection.

Consider what house the planet interposing or translating

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

the nature and light of the two planets is lord of, and describe him or
her; and say to the querent, that such a party shall do good in the
business of, &c.; viz. if lord of the second, a good purse effects the
matter; if lord of the third, a kinsman or neighbour; and so of all the
rest of the houses; of which more hereafter.

*Collection*.--Matters are also brought to perfection, when the two
principal significators do not behold one another, but both cast their
several aspects to a more weighty planet than themselves, and they both
receive him in some of their essential dignities; then shall that
planet, who thus *collects* both their lights, bring the thing demanded
to perfection; which signifies that a person somewhat interested in both
parties, and described and signified by that planet, shall perform the
thing which otherwise could not be perfected; as many times you see two
fall at variance, and of themselves cannot think of any way of
accommodation, when suddenly a neighbour or friend accidentally
reconciles all differences, to the content of both parties; and this is
called a collection.

In all questions, you are generally to observe this method
following:--The ascendant represents the person of the querent, and the
second his estate, the third his kindred, the fourth his father, the
fifth his children, the sixth his servant or sickness, the seventh his
wife, the eighth the manner of his death, the ninth his religion or
journeys, the tenth his estimation or honour, mother, trade, &c.; the
eleventh his friends, the twelfth his secret enemies: also understand,
that when one asks concerning a woman, or any party signified by the
seventh house and the lord thereof, that then the seventh house shall be
her ascendant, and signify her person; the eighth house shall signify
her estate, and be her second; the ninth house shall signify her
brethren and kindred; the tenth shall represent her father; the eleventh
her children, or whether

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

apt to have children; the twelfth her sickness and servants; the first
house her sweetheart; the second house her death; the third her journey;
the fourth her mother, or trade, &c.; the fifth her friends; the sixth
her sorrow, care, and private enemies. Let the question be of or
concerning a churchman, minister, or the brother of the wife or
sweetheart, the ninth house shall represent each of these; but the tenth
house shall be significator of *his* substance; the eleventh house of
his brethren; and so in order: and so in all manner of questions, the
house signifying the party quesited shall be his ascendant or first
house, the next his second house, and so continuing round about the
whole heavens of twelve houses. If a question be made of a king or
nobleman, the tenth is his first house, the eleventh his second, &c.;
but in nativities, the ascendant always influences the party born,
whether king or beggar. These things preceding being well understood,
you may proceed to judgment; not that it is necessary you have all that
is written in your memory exactly, but, that you be able to know when
you are in error, when not; when to judge a question, when not.

*Of the true Time of erecting a Figure*.

The proper time is that when you feel most anxious about any matter, and
first form the resolution to erect a figure on the subject: if you find
the figure radical, and lay aside all self-love and prejudice, you may
safely judge a figure erected for that instant of time.

If a person apply to an astrologer, the figure must be taken for the
exact time he first speaks on the subject; or, if it be by letter, when
it is first read and understood by the artist. If it be not a question,
but an event suddenly happening, then the moment of its commencement
will shew, by a figure, its result &c.; as the first setting off on a
journey, beginning

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

a letter, or any business, &c.; or when you first discover the loss of
any article, or hear of any event happening: in all these cases, the
first impression on your mind is the true moment for the figure.

*Of the Planet or Planets which hinder or impedite the Thing demanded in
any Question*.

In all questions consider carefully what planet it is which obstructs or
hinders the perfection of the thing desired. We receive judgment herein
from that planet with whom the lord of the ascendant be joined, (whether
by bodily ☌ or by aspect), or the significator of the thing inquired
after, whether it be the ☽ herself, or that she be partaker with the
lord of the ascendant or not, or signify the thing demanded.

Carefully observe the planet to which the querent's significator is
joined, or the ☽; and observe how that planet is disposed, and unto whom
*he* is joined; for if the lord of the ascendant, ☽, or significator of
the thing propounded, be joined to an evil planet, evilly disposed,
without reception, or if he be not evilly disposed, but be joined to an
infortune, and that infortune receive him not, it denotes the
destruction of the thing demanded.

A planet is ill-disposed when he is *peregrine*, *retrograde*,
*combust*; also if *cadent* and behold not the lord of the house or the
cusp of the house of the thing demanded. The aspect to the cusp is
better than to the lord of the house.

If the significator, as above, be joined to an unfortunate planet, viz.
one retrograde, combust, or cadent; then observe whether mutual
reception intervene; which shews the perfection of the matter, though
with much labour and solicitation. If there be no reception, the affair
will come to nothing though there may have been much probability of its
performance.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

If the lord of the ascendant, the ☽, or lord of the thing demanded, or
the planet who receives any of them, be free from affliction, though
without mutual reception, it perfects the matter with facility.

If any one of them be free from the infortunes, and joined with any
benevolent planet, who is himself aspected by a malevolent, without
mutual reception, the matter will be brought to a good conclusion.

Consider carefully whether planets in aspect be without reception, for
when they are in reception, things are ever brought to pass; though, if
the aspect be evil, with degree of trouble, delay, &c.

Consider also, whether any other planet *prohibit* before the
significators join in perfect ☌ with an evil planet; if so, it hinders
the thing from happening: but if no such prohibition or cutting off the
light of the *infortune* occur, by which its malevolence may be taken
off, the thing will be effected.

If an infortune *collect* the light of other planets, or if light be
translated to an infortune, the matter will not be effected unless there
be reception; viz. that the infortune be received by, or disposed of, or
ruled by, (which is all one thing), the significators.
