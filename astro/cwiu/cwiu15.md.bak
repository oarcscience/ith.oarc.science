### XII. Conclusion:

#### THE DIVINE ARTIFEX AND THE DIEU FAINÉANT

Why, indeed? Leibniz, who was much more interested in morals than in
physics and in man than in the cosmos, could have answered that it was
the only means to avoid making God responsible for the actual
management, or mismanagement, of this our world. God just did not do
what He wanted, or would like to do. There were laws, and rules, that He
could neither change nor tamper with. Things had natures that He could
not modify. He had made a perfect mechanism in the working of which He
could not interfere. Could not and should not, as this world was the
best of all the possible worlds that He could create. God, therefore,
was blameless for the evils that He could not prevent or amend. After
all, this world was only the best *possible* world, not a perfectly good
one; that was *not* possible.

Leibniz might have said this in reply to Clarke. But he did not read
Clarke's *fifth* reply. He died before he received it. Thus their fight,
a fight in which both sides fought *pro majore Dei gloria*, ended as
abruptly as it started. The outcome of the Homeric struggle was not
conclusive; neither side, as we have seen, budged an inch. Yet, in the
decades that followed, Newtonian science and

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Newtonian
philosophy gained more and more ground, gradually overcoming the
resistance of the Cartesians and the Leibnizians who, though opposing
each other on many points, made a common front against the common foe.

At the end of the century Newton's victory was complete. The Newtonian
God reigned supreme in the infinite void of absolute space in which the
force of universal attraction linked together the atomically structured
bodies of the immense universe and made them move around in accordance
with strict mathematical laws.

Yet it can be argued that this victory was a Pyrrhic one, and that the
price paid for it was disastrously high. Thus, for instance, the force
of attraction which, for Newton, was a proof of the insufficiency of
pure mechanism, a demonstration of the existence of higher,
non-mechanical powers, the manifestation of God's presence and action in
the world, ceased to play this role, and became a purely natural force,
a property of matter, that enriched mechanism instead of supplanting it.
As Dr. Cheyne explained quite reasonably, attraction was assuredly not
an essential property of body, but why should not God have endowed
matter with unessential properties? Or, as Henry More and Roger
Cotes—and later, Voltaire—pointed out, since we possess no knowledge of
the substances of things, and know nothing about the link that connects
property with substance, even in the cases of hardness or
impenetrability, we cannot deny that attraction belongs to matter just
because we do not understand how it works.

As for the dimensions of the material universe which Newtonians at first
had opposed to the actual infinity of absolute space, the relentless
pressure of the principles

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

of plenitude and sufficient reason, by which Leibniz managed to infect
his successful rivals, made it co-extensive with space itself. God, even
the Newtonian one, could obviously not limit His creative action and
treat a certain part of infinite homogeneous space—though able to
distinguish it from the rest—in a way so utterly different from the
others. Thus the material universe, in spite of filling only an
exceedingly small part of the infinite void, became just as infinite as
this. The same reasoning which prevented God from limiting His creative
action in respect to space could, just as well, be applied to time. An
infinite, immutable and *sempiternal* God could not be conceived as
behaving in a different manner at different times, and as limiting His
creative action to a small stretch of it. Moreover, an infinite universe
existing only for a limited duration seems illogical. Thus the created
world became infinite both in Space and in Time. But an infinite and
eternal world, as Clarke had so strongly objected to Leibniz, can hardly
admit creation. It does not need it; it exists by virtue of this very
infinity.

Furthermore, the gradual dissolution of traditional ontology under the
impact of the new philosophy undermined the validity of the inference
from the attribute to its supporting substance. Space, consequently,
lost progressively its attributive or substantial character; from the
ultimate stuff which the world was made of (the substantial space of
Descartes) or the attribute of God, the frame of his presence and action
(the space of Newton), it became more and more the void of the atomists,
neither substance nor accident, the infinite, uncreated nothingness, the
frame of the absence of all being; consequently also of God's.

Last but not least, the world-clock made by the Divine Artifex was much
better than Newton had thought it to be. Every progress of Newtonian
science brought new proofs for Leibniz's contention: the moving force of
the universe, its *vis viva*, did not decrease; the world-clock needed
neither rewinding, nor mending.

The Divine Artifex had therefore less and less to do in the world. He
did not even need to conserve it, as the world, more and more, became
able to dispense with this service.

Thus the mighty, energetic God of Newton who actually "ran" the universe
according to His free will and decision, became, in quick succession, a
conservative power, an *intelligentia supra-mundana*, a "Dieu fainéant."

Laplace who, a hundred years after Newton, brought the New Cosmology to
its final perfection, told Napoleon, who asked him about the role of God
in his *System of the World*: "Sire, je n’ai pas eu besoin de cette
hypothèse." (I did not need this hypothesis) But it was not Laplace's
*System*, it was the world described in it that no longer needed the
hypothesis God.

The infinite Universe of the New Cosmology, infinite in Duration as well
as in Extension, in which eternal matter in accordance with eternal and
necessary laws moves endlessly and aimlessly in eternal space, inherited
all the ontological attributes of Divinity. Yet only those—all the
others the departed God took away with Him.
