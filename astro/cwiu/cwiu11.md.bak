### VIII. The Divinization of Space

*Joseph Raphson*

Newton, as far as I know, never quoted More; nor did he make an explicit
reference to his teachings. Yet the relations between the theories of
the two Cambridge men could not, of course, escape their contemporaries.
It is therefore not surprising that, fifteen years after the publication
of the *Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy*, their connection
was openly proclaimed by Joseph Raphson, a promising young
mathematician, Master of Arts and Fellow of the Royal
Society,[1](cwiu16.htm#an_8_1.md) in an extremely interesting and valuable
Appendix which he added, in 1702, to the second edition of his
*Universal Analysis of Equations*.[2](cwiu16.htm#an_8_2.md)

In this *Appendix*, which bears the title *On the real space or the
Infinite Being*, Joseph Raphson, who obviously has neither Newton's
subjective inclination for reticence and secrecy, nor his objective
reasons for prudence, dots all the i’s and crosses all the t’s.

Starting with a historical account of the development of the conception
of space which begins with Lucretius and culminates in Henry More's
criticism of the Cartesian

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

identification of extension with matter, his characterization of matter
by impenetrability, and his demonstration of the existence of an
immovable and immaterial extension, Raphson states his
conclusion:[3](cwiu16.htm#an_8_3.md)

<div class="iq">

Thus from every motion (extended and corporeal), even from the \[only\]
possible ones follows necessarily \[the existence of\] an immovable and
incorporeal extended \[entity\], because everything which moves in the
extension must necessarily move through extension. The extension of the
real motion demonstrates the real existence of this immovable extended
\[entity\], because otherwise it \[the motion\] can be neither expressed
nor conceived, and because that which we cannot but conceive is
necessarily true. It could be argued in the same manner concerning the
supposed motion of figures in geometry. The possibility of these motions
demonstrates the hypothetical necessity of this immovable extended
\[entity\], and the reality of the physical motions, the absolute.

</div>

There is an unmistakable Spinozistic flavor in Raphson's terminology and
manner of speaking. Yet, though deeply influenced by
Spinoza,[4](cwiu16.htm#an_8_4.md) Raphson is by no means Spinozist. On the
contrary, More's distinction between the infinite, immovable, immaterial
extension and the material, mobile and therefore finite one is,
according to him, the sole and only means of avoiding the Spinozistic
identification of God with the world. But let us proceed with Raphson's
presentation of Henry More's theories.

The existence of motion implies, indeed, not only the distinction
between the immovable, immaterial extension and the material one, and
thus the rejection of the Cartesian identification; it implies also the
rejection of the Cartesian negation of *vacuum*: in a world completely
and

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

continuously filled with matter rectilinear motion would be utterly
impossible, and even circular motion would be extremely difficult to
achieve.[5](cwiu16.htm#an_8_5.md) The real existence of really void spaces
can thus be considered as fully demonstrated. Wherefrom we can draw the
following corollaries:[6](cwiu16.htm#an_8_6.md)

<div class="iq">

1\. The universal mass of movable \[bodies\] (or of the world) must
necessarily be finite, because, on account of the vacuum and the
mobility, each and every system of it may be compressed into a smaller
place; the finitude of the ensemble of these systems, that is, of the
world, follows herefrom necessarily, though the human mind will never be
able to arrive at its limit.

2\. All the finite \[beings\] existing separately can be comprehended by
a number. It is possible that no created mind is able to comprehend it.
Nevertheless, to their numerating Author, they will be in a finite
number: this can also be shown as follows: let, for example, (*a*) be
the minimum of what can exist, then (*a*) infinitely multiplied will
turn out to be infinite; indeed, if it gave a finite sum

</div>

the true minimum (or atom) would not be (*a*) but another infinitely
smaller, or infinitely small, body. This, however, as Raphson states, is
"against the hypothesis." Of course we are not studying here the
composition of space: we are dealing with impenetrable extended beings,
that is, with bodies.

<div class="iq">

3\. Herefrom can be argued the falsity of the teaching of Spinoza, who,
misusing his 6th definition, makes it so wide as to force matter,
insofar as it expresses essence, to express the essence of the Infinite
Being, and to be one of its attributes. I recognize, however, and I can
demonstrate, that everything of which the essence implies an absolute

</div>

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

<div class="iq">

infinity pertains necessarily to the *absolutely Infinite* Being; it is
in this way that I derive my idea of the absolutely Infinite Being,
which involves the supreme and absolute necessity.

</div>

The error of Spinoza is thus at once elucidated and corrected. Raphson
obviously thinks that Spinoza was perfectly right in following the
(Cartesian) principle of attributing to God all that is essentially
infinite; right also in rejecting the Cartesian distinction between the
infinite and the indefinite and in claiming for His extension actual and
not only potential infinity. But he is wrong in accepting the Cartesian
identification of extension and matter. Owing to Henry More's criticism
of Descartes, Raphson believes he is able to escape the Spinozistic
conclusion by attributing the infinite, *immaterial* extension to God,
and reducing matter to the status of creature.

Matter, as we know, is characterized by Raphson by its mobility (which
implies finitude) and impenetrability. As for the immaterial extension,
or more simply, space, its properties, nature and existence are derived
by him *more geometrico* "from the necessary and natural concatenation
of simple ideas."[7](cwiu16.htm#an_8_7.md)

Space is defined as[8](cwiu16.htm#an_8_8.md) "the innermost extended
\[entity\] (whatever it be) which is the first by nature and the very
last to be obtained by continuous division and separation"; Raphson
informs us that it is an imperfect definition or description of the
defined object; it does not tell us anything about its essence, but, on
the other hand, it has the advantage of being immediately acceptable as
designating something the existence of which is perfectly evident and
indubitable. Moreover, the analysis of the

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

ideas used in this definition will lead us towards important
consequences, namely towards the affirmation of the existence of a *real
space* really distinct from matter.

The investigation starts with a postulate, according to which a "given
idea" always enables us to derive from it the properties of the object,
even making abstraction of its existence. Three corollaries are added,
and these tell us that:[9](cwiu16.htm#an_8_9.md)

<div class="iq">

*All finite extended* can be divided (if only by the mind) or, what is
the same, be conceived as divided.

And it is (even if only for the concept) movable and possesses an actual
figure.

And \[its\] parts can be separated or removed from each other (if only
by the mind), or be conceived as being removed.

</div>

An axiom then asserts that:[10](cwiu16.htm#an_8_10.md)

<div class="iq">

Between things separated or removed from each other there is always a
distance (be it great or small), that is *something extended*.

</div>

A series of propositions now follows in quick
succession:[11](cwiu16.htm#an_8_11.md)

<div class="iq">

1\. *Space* (or the *innermost extended*) is by its nature, and
absolutely, indivisible, nor can it be conceived as divided

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —which, if
division means separation and mutual removal of parts, that is,
divisibility means *discerpibility*, is, of course, a cogent consequence
of the above-quoted corollaries.

<div class="iq">

2\. *Space* is absolutely, and by its nature, immovable

</div>

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —motion indeed
implies divisibility.

<div class="iq">

3\. *Space* is actually infinite

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —which; *vice
versa*, implies, immediately and by necessity, its absolute
immovability.

<div class="iq">

4\. *Space* is pure act.

5\. *Space* is all-containing and all-penetrating.

</div>

To pave the way to further development, that is, to the identification
of space with an attribute of God, Raphson adds
that[12](cwiu16.htm#an_8_12.md)

<div class="iq">

. . . doubtlessly this is the reason why for the Hebrews the name of
this *Infinite* was *Makom*; as it is that of St Paul's 'it is nearer to
us than we are to ourselves.' It is to this Infinite that assuredly must
be referred a great number of passages of the Holy Scripture as well as
the hidden wisdom of the old Hebrews about the highest and
incomprehensible amplitude of the *Ensoph*; as well as the teaching of
the Gentiles about the all permeant, the all-embracing etc.

</div>

But let us not think that space is a kind of immaterial stuff—Raphson,
obviously, wants to oppose *space* to More's
*spirit*:[13](cwiu16.htm#an_8_13.md)

<div class="iq">

It is patent that space is not penetrated by anything: being infinite
and undivided it penetrates everything by its innermost essence, and
therefore cannot itself be penetrated by anything, nor even can it be
conceived as penetrated.

</div>

It is clear thus that[14](cwiu16.htm#an_8_14.md)

<div class="iq">

6\. *Space* is incorporeal.

7\. *Space* is immutable.

</div>

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

<div class="iq">

8\. *Space* is one in itself, \[and therefore\] . . . it is the most
simple entity, not composed of any things and not divisible into any
things.

9\. *Space* is eternal \[because\] the actually infinite cannot not be .
. . in other words, that *it cannot not be* is essential to the actually
infinite. It was therefore always.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This means that it
is, or has, a necessary being, that the eternity of the infinite is the
same thing as its existence, and that both imply the same
necessity[15](cwiu16.htm#an_8_15.md)

<div class="iq">

10\. *Space* is incomprehensible to us, \[just because it is infinite\].

11\. *Space* is most perfect in its kind \[*genus*\].

12\. Extended things can neither be nor be conceived without it. And
therefore

13\. *Space* is an attribute (namely the immensity) of the First Cause.

</div>

This last proposition, according to Raphson, can also be demonstrated in
a much easier and more direct way: as, indeed, the First
Cause[16](cwiu16.htm#an_8_16.md)

<div class="iq">

. . . can neither give anything that it does not possess, nor be the
cause of any perfection that it does not contain (in a certain manner)
in the same degree if not in a greater one; and as there can be nothing
*in rerum natura* except extended and unextended \[things\]; and as we
have demonstrated that extension is perfection, existing everywhere, and
is even infinite, necessary, eternal, etc., it follows necessarily that
it must be found in the *First Cause* of the extended \[things\] without
which the extended \[things\] cannot exist. Which it was proper to
demonstrate. For the true and reciprocal reason of the omniform, true
and actual infinity is found to consist in the most absolute unity, just
as,

</div>

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

<div class="iq">

*vice versa*, the highest reason of the unity culminates in and is
absorbed by the infinity. For whatever expresses the actual, and in its
kind most absolute, infinity, necessarily expresses the essence of the
*First Cause*, the Author of everything that is.

</div>

It is rather curious to see Raphson use the Cartesian and even
Spinozistic logic and patterns of reasoning to promote Henry More's
metaphysical doctrine. Yet it cannot be denied that by these means
Raphson succeeded in giving it a much higher degree of consistency than
it had from its author. Henry More, indeed, could only present us with a
list of "titles" applicable both to space and to God. Raphson shows
their inner connection; moreover, by identifying infinity, on the one
hand, with highest perfection, and, on the other hand, by transforming
extension itself into perfection, he makes the attribution of extension
to God logically as well as metaphysically unavoidable.

Having established the attribution to the *First Cause* of infinite
space (which taken abstractly is the object of geometry, and taken as
reality is the very immensity of God), Raphson now goes on to a more
careful consideration of their connection:[17](cwiu16.htm#an_8_17.md)

<div class="iq">

That its \[the First Cause's\] true and essential presence is a
necessary prerequisite as well of the essential being as of the real
existence of all things is recognized by a number of contemporaries.
But, how this essential and intimate presence can be explained in the
hypothesis of the nonextension \[of the First Cause\] without a manifest
contradiction has not yet been made clear; and it will never be possible
to make it clear. Indeed, to be present by essence in places diverse and
distant from each other, for instance

</div>

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

<div class="iq">

in the globe of the Moon and in that of the earth, and also in the
intermediate space, what else is it but, precisely, to extend oneself?
Now, we have demonstrated that this extension is truly real,
indivisible, immaterial (or, if you wish, spiritual). What else is there
to be desired in order to infer its perfection, supreme and infinite of
its kind (insofar as it is an inadequate concept of the Infinite Being)?

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I do not see,
concludes Raphson, by what other name than extension or space this
essential omnipresence of the First Cause could be expressed.

The philosophers were right, of course, in removing from the First Cause
the imperfect, divisible, material extension. Yet, by the rejection from
it of all kinds of extension, they opened up the way towards atheism, or
rather hylotheism, to a great many people, namely, to those who did not
want to be hemmed in by ingenuous circuits of ambiguous circumlocutions
and embarrassed by obscure and unintelligible notions and terms. Such
are Hobbes and some others: because they did not find anywhere in the
world this infinite and eternal, unextended Supreme Being, they thought
that it did not exist at all, and boldly proposed their opinions to the
world. So too had some of the ancients, who insisted upon the
incomprehensibility of the Supreme Being. The explanation of all these
aberrations is to be sought, according to Raphson, in the
misunderstanding of the very essence of extension that has been falsely
held to be necessarily something imperfect and lacking all unity and
reality. In truth, however, extension, as such, is something positive
and denotes a very real perfection. Accordingly, as
generally[18](cwiu16.htm#an_8_18.md)

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

<div class="iq">

. . . everything positive and substantial that is found in the essence
of things as their primary and constitutive attribute, such as extension
in matter, etc., must necessarily be really and truly present in the
First Cause, and be in it in a degree of infinite excellence in the
manner most perfect of its kind,

</div>

the infinite extension must be truly and really, and not only
metaphorically, attributed to the First Cause.

The First Cause appears thus as the twofold source, or cause, of the
perfections of the created things that it contains, as the Schoolmen
say, in an eminent and transcendent manner.[19](cwiu16.htm#an_8_19.md)

<div class="iq">

For (as they say) *it gives nothing that it does not have* (in a more
perfect manner) in itself.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Consequently they
assert that God is a thinking Being: how could, indeed, *a thinking
being* (*like ourselves*) *proceed from a non-thinking one?* But we can
reverse the question and, with exactly the same right, ask: *how can an
extended being come forth from an unextended one?* The Schoolmen, of
course, want both perfections to be contained in the First Cause in the
transcendent manner. As for extension, such as it is in matter, they
justly argue that it is imperfect. We, however, and we can quote good
authorities in favor of this opinion, for instance, Father Malebranche,
regard cogitation, or thought (such as it is in human minds, or in the
created spirits), to be just as imperfect in comparison to that of the
Absolutely Infinite Being. And though, perhaps, cogitation in finite
thinking beings is much more perfect than extension, as it is in matter,
it is doubtless removed by the same interval, that is, by an infinite
one, from the source of these

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

perfections in the First Cause, and, in relation to it, they are both
equally imperfect.[20](cwiu16.htm#an_8_20.md)

<div class="iq">

The infinite amplitude of extension expresses the immense diffusion of
being in the First Cause, or its infinite and truly interminate essence.
This \[amplitude\] is that originary *extensive* perfection, which we
have found, so imperfectly counterfeited, in matter.

The infinite (whatever it be) and most perfect energy, everywhere
indivisibly the same, which produces and perpetually conserves
everything (and which this never-sufficiently-to-be-admired series of
*Divine Ratiocination*, that is, the whole fabric of nature, more than
sufficiently demonstrates to us *a posteriori*), is this *intensive*
perfection, which though \[distant from it\] by an infinite interval in
kind as well as in degree, we, miserable examples of the infinite
Archetype, flatter ourselves to imitate.

</div>

Raphson's assertions are to be taken *verbatim*: extension as such is a
perfection, even gross, material extension. The *modus* of its
realization in bodies is, to be sure, extremely defective, precisely as
our discoursive thought is an extremely defective modus of cogitation;
but, just as in spite of its discoursiveness our thought is an imitation
of, and a participation in, God's cogitativeness, so in spite of its
divisibility and mobility our bodily extension is an imitation of, and a
participation in, God's own and perfect extensiveness.

As for the latter, we have already proved that:[21](cwiu16.htm#an_8_21.md)

<div class="iq">

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> . . . this
internal or truly innermost locus penetrates everything by its essence
and, undivided, is most intimately present in everything; that it cannot
be, or even be thought of, as penetrated by any thing, and that it is
infinite, most

</div>

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

<div class="iq">

perfect, one and indivisible. Hence it clearly appears by what infinite
interval are distant from it all other things that have only an
evanescent being and, to use the elegant expression of the Prophet
(Isaiah, 40), are as nothing to this *Infinite* and *Eternal* and, so to
speak, essential (οὐσιότατον) Being. They are, as it were, light shadows
of the true Reality and even if they were everywhere, they would by no
means express even in the lowest degree that Infinity which we
understand to be supremely positive and supremely real in the First
Cause.

</div>

Thus, even if it were infinitely extended—which it is not—matter would
never be identical with the divine extension and would never be able to
become an attribute of God. Joseph Raphson is to such a degree elated
and ravished by the contemplation of the idea of infinity that we could
apply to him (though modifying it somewhat) the expression used by Moses
Mendelssohn for Spinoza: he is drunk with infinity. He goes so far
as—paradoxically—to reject Henry More's reassertion of the fundamental
and primary validity of the category or question: "where?" In infinity
it has no meaning. The infinite is not something, a sphere, of which the
center is everywhere and the limits nowhere; it is something of which
the center is nowhere also, something that has neither limits nor
center, something in respect to which the question "where?" cannot be
asked, as in respect to it everywhere is nowhere,
*nullibi*.[22](cwiu16.htm#an_8_22.md)

<div class="iq">

In respect to this immense locus a system of finite bodies, be it ever
so large, is truly said to be nowhere. It is indeed utterly
immeasurable; *here*, *there*, *in the middle*, etc. vanish in it
completely.

</div>

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

Raphson is obviously right. In the infinite homogeneous space all
"places" are perfectly equivalent and cannot be distinguished from each
other: they all have the same "position" in respect to the
whole.[23](cwiu16.htm#an_8_23.md)

<div class="iq">

The illustrious Guericke has very well written about it in his
*Magdeburgian* *Experiments*, p. 65: If in this immensity (which has no
beginning, nor end, nor middle) somebody marched for an infinitely long
\[time\], and traversed innumerable thousands of miles, he would, in
relation to this immensity, be in the same place; and if he repeated his
action and arrived ten infinities farther, he would nevertheless be in
this immensity in the same way and in the same place and would not be a
single step nearer to the end, or the fulfillment of his intention,
because in the Immeasurable (*Immensum*) there is no relation. All
relations in it are conceived in reference to ourselves or to some other
created thing. Indeed this immense *locus* is truly everywhere; and
everything that has its finite *where?* (as they are wont to speak about
spirits) has it as a relation to some other finite \[thing\]; but in
relation to the Immensity it is truly nowhere.

</div>

Yet, if Raphson insists so strongly upon the infinity of uncreated space
in contradistinction to the finitude of the created world, it is by no
means his intention to assign to this latter determinate, or even
determinable—by us—dimensions. Quite the contrary: in infinite space
there is room enough for a practically indeterminate and indefinitely
large world. Thus he tells us that if[24](cwiu16.htm#an_8_24.md)

<div class="iq">

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> . . . there can be
absolutely no reason why \[the world\] should extend itself to the
infinity of its immense locus, as it does not possess an absolute
plenitude and is composed of movable parts . . . whereas the *absolutely
Infinite*

</div>

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

<div class="iq">

is utterly immovable and absolutely one or full of itself . . .
\[nevertheless\] . . . how great the universe is or how far it extends,
is completely hidden to us.

</div>

Raphson himself would[25](cwiu16.htm#an_8_25.md)

<div class="iq">

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> . . . easily
believe that it can be immeasurable in respect to our capacity of
understanding, and that we shall never be able to comprehend it. Indeed,
it does not follow that we can comprehend by our cogitation all
magnitude that is not infinite, or that we should ever be able to depict
it in our mind as so large that the universe could not, in truth, be
even larger. We can, for instance, conceive a series of numbers,
disposed in a straight line, to extend from this our earth to the
Dog-Star, or to any one in the Milky Way or to whatever visible limit,
the unity of these \[numbers\] expressing the distance between the earth
and that limit; we can also conceive this number to be squared, raised
to the third, fourth, and so on, power, until the index of this power
becomes equal to the first number, or to its first root; we can finally
consider this power as a root of others, progressing in the same manner.
And yet it is, perhaps, as nothing compared to the magnitude of the
universe which can, and possibly does, surpass the capacity of any
finite numbering \[mind\], not only ours, and cannot be comprehended by
any other than its immense Author. Yet it is certain that it cannot be
infinite in that absolute manner in which the *First Cause* is, insofar
as it is considered as the immense *locus* of things.

</div>

We see it thus quite clearly: the difference between the infinite and
the finite is not a difference between "more" and "less"; it is not a
[quantitative](errata.htm#3.md), but a qualitative one, and, though studied
by mathematicians, it is fundamentally a metaphysical difference. It is
this difference which,

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

fully understood, enables us not to lapse into the error of a
pantheistic confusion of the Creator God with the created world, and it
is this selfsame difference which provides us with a firm ground for the
study of the nearly infinite variety of created things. Indeed,
those[26](cwiu16.htm#an_8_26.md)

<div class="iq">

who will \[study\] this part of the universe, visible to us, not only in
books, but who will diligently read and carefully contemplate \[the book
of Nature\], using his own observations and the \[analysis\] of the
constitution of the skies, will hardly fail to recognize not only that
there can be a plurality of worlds, but that, in truth, there are a
nearly infinite number of systems, various laws of motion, exhibiting
various (nearly innumerable) phenomena and creatures.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Why, even on this
earth there are so many and such varied creatures, endowed with so many
different faculties, possibly even with some that are completely unknown
to us. How many more could there be elsewhere that can be called into
being by the infinite combinative art of the Infinite Architect.

As for us, the only doors open to the true cogitation of the universe
are observation and experience. By the first we arrive at the system of
visible motions of the world; by the second we discover the forces, the
(sensible) qualities and mutual relations of bodies. Mathematics
(mathematical physics) and chemistry are the sciences that arise on
these empirical foundations. As for the "hypotheses" that go beyond
these empirical data, they may be plausible, and even, sometimes, useful
for the investigation of truth; yet they breed prejudices and therefore
cause more harm than good. *Hypothesomania*,

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

the invention of new hypotheses, belongs to poetical and fictitious
philosophy, not to the pursuit of knowledge. For the latter, according
to Raphson, the method established by the supreme philosopher, Newton,
in his *Principia*, consisting in the study of the phenomena of nature
by means of experiments and rational mechanics, reducing them to forces
the action of which—though their nature is hidden from us—is obvious and
patent in the world.

As we see, empiricism and metaphysics, and even a very definite kind of
metaphysics, the creationist, are closely linked together. What other
means, indeed, but observation and experience can we possibly use for
the study of a world freely created by an Infinite God? Raphson
concludes therefore:[27](cwiu16.htm#an_8_27.md)

<div class="iq">

Neither can Human Philosophy theoretically compose the smallest mouse or
the simplest plant, nor can human praxis build them, much less the whole
universe. These are problems worthy of the Primordial Wisdom and Power
which produces these things. As for us, they offer us only a progress
*in aeternum* of our knowledge both of the things themselves and of the
perpetually geometrizing God.
