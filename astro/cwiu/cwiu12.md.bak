### IX. God and the World:

#### SPACE, MATTER, ETHER AND SPIRIT

*Isaac Newton*

It is difficult to tell what the reasons were that determined Newton to
enlarge, in the Latin edition (translation) of his *Opticks*, the number
of *Queries* appended by him to the third book of his work, and to
include among the additional ones two rather long and extremely
important and interesting papers which, in contradistinction to the
purely technical *Queries* of the first English edition, deal, not with
optical, but with methodological, epistemological and metaphysical
problems.[1](cwiu16.htm#an_9_1.md)

The publication of Raphson's book could not have been the motive: the
*De spatio reali* was published in 1702, the Latin translation of the
*Opticks* in 1706; but the English edition appeared in 1704 and if
Newton wanted to make his position clear in relation to Raphson's, he
could, and should have done it in 1704. It is possible, in my
opinion—though it is only a conjecture—that it was the publication of
Dr. George Cheyne's *Philosophical* 

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Principles of
Natural Religion* that gave Newton the incentive, usually lacking, to
come into the open.[2](cwiu16.htm#an_9_2.md)

Now, be this as it may, it is these *Queries* (which, curiously enough,
seem to have been ignored by Berkeley) which build the subject of the
famous polemics between Leibniz and Clarke. It is, indeed, in these
Queries (21 and 22) that, in a much more precise and clear manner than
anywhere else—the *General Scholium* of the second edition of the
*Principia* not excluded—Newton states his conceptions about the purpose
and aim of philosophy and develops, at the same time, his general
world-view: an extremely interesting and fairly consistent system of
"corpuscular philosophy"—already sketched in his letters to
Bentley—asserting the fundamental unity of matter and light, and
presenting the material components of the universe, that is, hard,
indivisible particles, as constantly acted upon by quite a system of
various *non-material* attractive and repulsive forces. Thus *Query* 20
(28 in the second edition) explains at length the physical
(astronomical) inadmissibility of the plenum (a completely full space
would oppose such a strong resistance to motion that it would be
practically impossible and would have ceased long ago), as well as the
physical (astronomical) admissibility of the celestial spaces’ being
filled with an extremely thin, rare and tenuous ether, of which the
density can be made as small as we wish (is not our air "at the height
of 70, 140, 210 miles 100,000, 100,000,000,000 or 100,000,000,000,000
times rarer, and so on" than on the earth?), which implies the granular
structure of this ether, the existence of a *vacuum* and the rejection
of a continuous medium, and concludes:[3](cwiu16.htm#an_9_3.md)

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

<div class="iq">

And for rejecting such a Medium, we have the Authority of those oldest
and most celebrated Philosophers of *Greece* and *Phoenicia*, who made a
Vacuum, and Atoms, and the Gravity of Atoms, the first Principles of
their Philosophy; tacitly attributing Gravity to some other Cause than
dense Matter. Later Philosophers banish the Consideration of such a
Cause out of natural Philosophy, feigning Hypotheses for explaining all
things mechanically, and referring other Causes to Metaphysicks: Whereas
the main Business of natural Philosophy is to argue from Phaenomena
without feigning Hypotheses, and to deduce Causes from Effects, till we
come to the very first Cause, which certainly is not mechanical; and not
only to unfold the Mechanism of the World, but chiefly to resolve these
and such like Questions. What is there in places almost empty of Matter,
and whence is it that the Sun and Planets gravitate towards one another,
without dense Matter between them? Whence is it that Nature doth nothing
in vain; and whence arises all that Order and Beauty which we see in the
World? To what end are Comets, and whence is it that Planets move all
one and the same way in Orbs concentrick, while Comets move all manner
of ways in Orbs very excentrick; and what hinders the fix’d Stars from
falling upon one another? How came the Bodies of Animals to be contrived
with so much Art, and for what ends were their several Parts? Was the
Eye contrived without Skill in Opticks, and the Ear without Knowledge of
Sounds? How do the Motions of the Body follow from the Will, and whence
is the instinct in Animals? Is not the Sensory of Animals that place to
which the sensitive Substance is present, and into which the sensible
Species of Things are carried through the Nerves and Brain, that there
they may be perceived by their immediate presence to that Substance? And
these things being rightly dispatch’d, does it not appear from
Phaenomena that there

</div>

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

<div class="iq">

is a Being incorporeal, living, intelligent, omnipresent, who in
infinite Space, as it were in his Sensory, sees the things themselves
intimately, and thoroughly perceives them, and comprehends them wholly
by their immediate presence to himself: Of which things the Images only
carried through the Organs of Sense into our little Sensoriums, are
there seen and beheld by that which in us perceives and thinks. And
though every true Step made in this Philosophy brings us not immediately
to the Knowledge of the first Cause, yet it brings us nearer to it, and
on that account is to be highly valued.

</div>

As for *Query* 23 (31), it starts with the question:

<div class="iq">

Have not the small Particles of Bodies certain Powers, Virtues, or
Forces, by which they act at a distance, not only upon the Rays of Light
for reflecting, refracting, and inflecting them, but also upon one
another for producing a great Part of the Phaenomena of Nature? For it's
well known, that Bodies act one upon another by the Attractions of
Gravity, Magnetism, and Electricity; and these Instances shew the Tenor
and the Course of Nature, and make it not improbable but that there may
be more attractive Powers than these. For Nature is very consonant and
conformable to her self.

</div>

Newton does not tell us outright—any more than he does in the
*Principia*—what these various "Powers" are. Just as in the *Principia*,
he leaves that question open, though, as we know, he holds them to be
non-mechanical, immaterial and even "spiritual" energy extraneous to
matter.'

<div class="iq">

How these Attractions may be perform’d, I do not here consider. What I
call attraction may be perform’d by impulse, or by some other means
unknown to me. I use

</div>

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

<div class="iq">

that Word here to signify only in general any Force by which Bodies tend
towards one another, [whatsoever](errata.htm#4.md) be the Cause. For we
must learn from the Phaenomena of Nature what Bodies attract one
another, and what are the Laws and Properties of the Attraction, before
we enquire the Cause by which the Attraction is perform’d. The
Attractions of Gravity, Magnetism, and Electricity, reach to very
sensible distances, and so have been observed by vulgar Eyes, and there
may be others which reach to so small distances as hitherto escape
Observation; and perhaps electrical Attraction may reach to such small
distances, even without being excited by Friction.

</div>

Whatever these "Powers" may be, they are, in any case, real forces and
perfectly indispensable for the explanation—even a hypothetical one—of
the existence of bodies, that is, of the sticking together of the
material particles that compose them; a purely materialistic pattern of
nature is utterly impossible (and a purely materialistic or mechanistic
physics, such as that of Lucretius or of Descartes, is impossible,
too):[6](cwiu16.htm#an_9_6.md)

<div class="iq">

The Parts of all homogeneal hard Bodies which fully touch one another,
stick together very strongly. And for explaining how this may be, some
have invented hooked Atoms, which is begging the Question; and others
tell us that Bodies are glued together by rest, that is, by an occult
Quality, or rather by nothing; and others, that they stick together by
conspiring Motions, that is, by relative rest amongst themselves. I had
rather infer from their Cohesion, that their Particles attract one
another by some Force, which in immediate Contact is exceeding strong,
at small distances performs the chymical Operations above-mention’d, and
reaches not far from the Particles with any sensible Effect.

</div>

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

It could be argued, of course (and was to be argued by Leibniz) that
Newton is wrong to stick to the classical atomic conception of hard,
impenetrable, indivisible last components of matter, a conception which
implies great difficulties for dynamics. It is indeed, impossible to say
what would happen if two absolutely hard bodies should collide. Let us
take, for instance, two perfectly similar and perfectly hard, that is,
absolutely unyielding and indeformable, bodies, and let them approach
each other—the classical case of dynamics—with the same speed. What will
they do after the impact? Rebound, as elastic bodies would do? Or stop
each other as would be the case with inelastic ones? As a matter of
fact, they should not do either—yet, *tertium non datur*. As we know,
Descartes, in order to preserve the principle of conservation of energy,
asserted the rebounding. But he was obviously wrong. If we admit,
however, that they would stop each other, that is, that motion is lost
in every impact, would not the world-machine run down very quickly and
very quickly come to a stop? Should we not, in order to avoid these
difficulties, discard completely the atomic conception and admit, for
instance, that matter is infinitely divisible or that its "last"
components are not hard atoms but soft, or elastic, particles, or even
"physical monads"? Newton, therefore, continues[7](cwiu16.htm#an_9_7.md)

<div class="iq">

All bodies seem to be composed of hard Particles: for otherwise Fluids
would not congeal; as Water, Oils, Vinegar, and Spirit or Oil of Vitriol
do by freezing; Mercury by fumes of Lead; Spirit of Nitre and Mercury,
by dissolving the Mercury and evaporating the Flegm; Spirit of Wine and
Spirit of Urine, by deflegming and mixing them; and Spirit of Urine and
Spirit of Salt, by subliming them

</div>

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

<div class="iq">

together to make Sal-amoniac. Even the Rays of Light seem to be hard
Bodies; for otherwise they would not retain different Properties in
their different Sides. And therefore Hardness may be reckon’d the
Property of all uncompounded Matter. At least, this seems to be as
evident as the universal Impenetrability of Matter. For all Bodies, so
far as Experience reaches, are either hard, or may be harden’d; and we
have no other Evidence of universal Impenetrability, besides a large
Experience without an experimental Exception. Now if compound Bodies are
so very hard as we find some of them to be, and yet are very porous, and
consist of Parts which are only laid together; the simple Particles
which are void of Pores, and were never yet divided, must be much
harder. For such hard Particles being heaped together, can scarce touch
one another in more than a few Points, and therefore must be separable
by much less Force than is requisite to break a solid Particle, whose
Parts touch in all the Space between them, without any Pores or
Interstices to weaken their Cohesion. And how such very hard Particles
which are only laid together, hold and that so firmly as they do,
without the assistance of something which causes them to be attracted or
press’d towards one another, is very difficult to conceive.

</div>

This "something," as we know, and as it is clear from the very texts I
am quoting, cannot be other, smaller, "ethereal" particles, at least not
in the last analysis, because the same question, that is, the question
about their interaction, can obviously be raised concerning the
"ethereal" particles themselves, and cannot be answered by postulating
an ultra-ether, which moreover, would imply the existence of an
ultra-ultra-ether, and so on.

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Forces of
attraction, and also of repulsion are therefore fundamental, though
non-material, elements of nature:[8](cwiu16.htm#an_9_8.md)

<div class="iq">

There are therefore Agents in Nature able to make the Particles of
Bodies stick together by very strong Attractions. And it is the Business
of experimental Philosophy to find them out.

</div>

Thus we see it once more: good, empirical and experimental natural
philosophy does not exclude from the fabric of the world and the
furniture of heaven immaterial or transmaterial forces. It only
renounces the discussion of their nature, and, dealing with them simply
as causes of the observable effects, treats them—being a *mathematical*
natural philosophy—as *mathematical* causes or forces, that is, as
mathematical concepts or relations. It is, on the contrary, the *a
priori* philosophy of the classical Greek atomists, who at least
recognized the existence of void space and probably even the
non-mechanical character of gravity, and of course that of Descartes,
that is guilty of this exclusion and of the impossible attempts to
explain everything by matter and motion. As for Newton himself, he is so
deeply convinced of the reality of these immaterial, and, in this sense,
transphysical forces, that this conviction enables him to devise a most
extraordinary and truly prophetic picture of the general structure of
material beings:[9](cwiu16.htm#an_9_9.md)

<div class="iq">

Now the smallest Particles of Matter may cohere by the strongest
Attractions, and compose bigger Particles of weaker Virtue; and many of
these may cohere and compose bigger Particles whose Virtue is still
weaker, and so on for divers Successions, until the Progression end in
the biggest Particles on which the Operations in Chymistry,

</div>

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

<div class="iq">

and the Colours of natural Bodies depend, and which by cohering compose
Bodies of a sensible Magnitude. If the Body is compact, and bends or
yields inward to Pression without any sliding of its Parts, it is hard
and elastick, returning to its Figure with a Force rising from the
mutual Attraction of its Parts. If the Parts slide upon one another, the
Body is malleable or soft. If they slip easily, and are of a fit Size to
be agitated by Heat, and the Heat is big enough to keep them in
Agitation, the Body is fluid; and if it be apt to stick to things, it is
humid; and the Drops of every fluid affect a round Figure by the mutual
Attraction of their Parts, as the Globe of the Earth and Sea affects a
round Figure by the mutual Attraction of its Parts by Gravity.

</div>

Moreover, as I have already hinted before, the admission of various
immaterial forces acting upon or distributed around the bodies or
particles according to strict mathematical laws—or to express it in a
more modern way: the admission of the existence of different fields of
forces connected with bodies and particles—enables us, and that is an
invaluable advantage, to superimpose them one upon the other, and even
to transform them into their contraries. Indeed,[10](cwiu16.htm#an_9_10.md)

<div class="iq">

Since Metals dissolved in Acids attract but a small quantity of the
Acid, their attractive Force can reach but to a small distance from
them. And as in Algebra, where affirmative Quantities vanish and cease,
there negative ones begin; so in Mechanicks, where Attraction ceases,
there a repulsive Virtue ought to succeed. And that there is such a
Virtue, seems to follow from the Reflexions and Inflexions of the Rays
of Light. For the Rays are repelled by Bodies in both these Cases,
without the immediate Contact of the

</div>

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

<div class="iq">

reflecting or inflecting Body. It seems also to follow from the Emission
of Light; the Ray so soon as it is shaken off from a shining Body by the
vibrating Motion of the Parts of the Body, and gets beyond the reach of
Attraction, being driven away with exceeding great Velocity. For that
Force which is sufficient to turn it back in Reflexion, may be
sufficient to emit it. It seems also to follow from the Production of
Air and Vapour. The Particles when they are shaken off from Bodies by
Heat or Fermentation, so soon as they are beyond the reach of the
Attraction of the Body, receding from it, and also from one another with
great Strength, and keeping at a distance, so as sometimes to take up
above a Million of Times more space than they did before in the form of
a dense Body. Which vast Contraction and Expansion seems unintelligible,
by feigning the Particles of Air to be springy and ramous, or rolled up
like Hoops, or by any other means than a repulsive Power.

</div>

Thus, the admission of immaterial "virtues" offers us an immediate and
elegant solution of the most important and crucial problem of
elasticity, or "springiness" of bodies; and *vice versa*, this very
solution demonstrates the impossibility of explaining this property of
bodies by purely mechanical means (as Descartes and Boyle tried to do)
and therefore confirms the insufficiency of pure materialism not only
for philosophy in general, but also for *natural* philosophy. As a
matter of fact, without the immaterial Powers and Virtues, there would
not be any Nature to philosophize about, because there would be no
cohesion, no unity and no motion; or if there were, at the beginning, it
would have ceased long ago. On the contrary, if we admit the double,
material as well as immaterial, structure of
Nature,[11](cwiu16.htm#an_9_11.md)

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

<div class="iq">

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> . . . Nature will
be very conformable to her self and very simple, performing all the
great Motions of the heavenly Bodies by the Attraction of Gravity which
intercedes those Bodies, and almost all the small ones of their
Particles by some other attractive and repelling Powers which intercede
the Particles. The vis inertiae is a passive Principle by which Bodies
persist in their Motion or Rest, receive Motion in proportion to the
Force impressing it, and resist as much as they are resisted. By this
Principle alone there never could have been any Motion in the World.
Some other Principle was necessary for putting Bodies into Motion; and
now they are in Motion, some other Principle is necessary for conserving
the Motion. For from the various Composition of two Motions, ’tis very
certain that there is not always the same quantity of Motion in the
World. For if two Globes joined by a slender Rod, revolve about their
common Center of Gravity with an uniform Motion, while that Center moves
on uniformly in a right Line drawn in the Plane of their circular
Motion; the Sum of the Motions of the two Globes, as often as the Globes
are in the right Line described by their common Center of Gravity, will
be bigger than the Sum of their Motions, when they are in a Line
perpendicular to that right Line. By this Instance it appears that
Motion may be got or lost.[11a](cwiu16.htm#an_9_11a.md) But by reason of
the Tenacity of Fluids, and Attrition of their Parts, and the Weakness
of Elasticity in Solids, Motion is much more apt to be lost than got,
and is always upon the Decay. For Bodies which are either absolutely
hard, or so soft as to be void of Elasticity, will not rebound from one
another. Impenetrability makes them only stop. If two equal Bodies meet
directly *in vacuo*, they will by the Laws of Motion stop where they
meet, and lose all their Motion, and remain in rest, unless they be
elastick, and receive new Motion from their Spring.

</div>

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

Yet, even if they be elastic, they cannot be absolutely elastic, and
thus, by each and every impact, some motion (that is, momentum) will be
lost. And if the world were full, as the Cartesians want it to be, then
the "vortical" motion assumed by Descartes would cease very quickly,
because[12](cwiu16.htm#an_9_12.md)

<div class="iq">

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> . . . unless the
Matter were void of all Tenacity and Attrition of Parts, and
Communication of Motion (which is not to be supposed,) the Motion would
constantly decay. Seeing therefore the variety of Motion that we find in
the World is always decreasing, there is a necessity of conserving it
and recruiting it by active Principles,

</div>

that is, in the last analysis by the constant action in the world of the
Omnipresent and All-powerful God. Newton therefore
continues:[13](cwiu16.htm#an_9_13.md)

<div class="iq">

All these things being consider’d, it seems probable to me, that God in
the Beginning form’d Matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable,
moveable Particles, of such Sizes and Figures, and with such other
Properties, and in such Proportion to Space, as most conducted to the
End for which he form’d them; and that these primitive Particles being
Solids, are incomparably harder than any porous Bodies compounded of
them; even so very hard, as never to wear or break in pieces; no
ordinary Power being able to divide what God himself made one in the
first Creation. While the Particles continue entire, they may compose
Bodies of one and the same Nature and Texture in all Ages: But should
they wear away, or break in pieces, the Nature of Things depending on
them, would be changed. Water and Earth, composed of old worn Particles
and Fragments of Particles, would not be of the same Nature and Texture
now, with Water and Earth composed of entire

</div>

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

<div class="iq">

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Particles in the
Beginning. And therefore, that Nature may be lasting, the Changes of
corporeal Things are to be placed only in the various Separations and
new Associations and Motions of these permanent Particles; compound
Bodies being apt to break, not in the midst of solid Particles, but
where those Particles are laid together, and only touch in a few Points.

It seems to me farther, that these Particles have not only a *Vis
inertiae*, accompanied with such passive Laws of Motion as naturally
result from that Force, but also that they are moved by certain active
Principles. . . .

</div>

and it is the action of these principles, or, more exactly, the action
of God by means of these principles that gives to the world its
structure and order, and it is this structure and order that enables us
to recognize that the world is an effect of choice, and not chance or
necessity. Natural philosophy—at least the good one, that is, the
Newtonian and not the Cartesian—thus transcends itself and leads us to
God:[14](cwiu16.htm#an_9_14.md)

<div class="iq">

. . . by the help of these Principles, all material Things seem to have
been composed of the hard and solid Particles above-mention’d, variously
associated in the first Creation by the Counsel of an intelligent Agent.
For it became him who created them to set them in order. And if he did
so, it's unphilosophical to seek for any other Origin of the World, or
to pretend that it might arise out of Chaos by the mere Laws of Nature;
though being once form’d, it may continue by those Laws for many Ages.
For while Comets move in very excentrick Orbs in all manner of
Positions, blind Fate could never make all the Planets move one and the
same way in Orbs concentrick, some inconsiderable Irregularities
excepted, which may have risen

</div>

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

<div class="iq">

from the mutual Actions of Comets and Planets upon one another, and
which will be apt to increase, till this System wants a Reformation.
Such a wonderful Uniformity in the Planetary System must be allowed the
Effect of Choice. And so must the Uniformity in the Bodies of Animals. .
. .

</div>

All that, and much more besides,[15](cwiu16.htm#an_9_15.md)

<div class="iq">

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> . . . can be the
effect of nothing else than the Wisdom and Skill of a powerful
ever-living Agent, who being in all Places, is more able by his Will to
move the Bodies within his boundless uniform Sensorium, and thereby to
form and reform the Parts of the Universe, than we are by our Will to
move the parts of our own Bodies. And yet we are not to consider the
World as the Body of God, or the several Parts thereof, as the Parts of
God. He is an uniform Being, void of Organs, Members or Parts, and they
are his Creatures subordinate to him, and subservient to his Will; and
he is no more the Soul of them, than the Soul of Man is the Soul of the
Species of Things carried through the Organs of Sense into the place of
its Sensation, where it perceives them by means of its immediate
Presence, without the Intervention of any third thing. The Organs of
Sense are not for enabling the Soul to perceive the Species of Things in
its Sensorium, but only for conveying them thither; and God has no need
of such Organs, he being everywhere present in the Things themselves.
And since Space is divisible *in infinitum*, and Matter is not
necessarily in all places, it may be also allow’d that God is able to
create Particles of Matter of several Sizes and Figures, and in several
Proportions to Space, and perhaps of different Densities and Forces, and
thereby to vary the Laws of Nature, and make Worlds of several sorts in
several Parts of the Universe. At least, I see nothing of Contradiction
in all this,

</div>

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

concludes Newton, who could have added that in the *Principia* he had
already shown—without insisting upon it—that the inverse square law of
attraction, the actual law of this world, was by no means the only
possible—although the most convenient one—and that God, had He wanted
to, could have adopted another. As he could have quoted his friend
Robert Boyle who believed that God had actually tried out, in different
worlds, different laws of motion; or Joseph Raphson who had just
expressed the same opinion. Yet he did not. As he did not quote Henry
More when he made infinite space the *sensorium* of the nevertheless
transcendent God.
