### LECTURE III. The Dissemination in the West

We have seen the "Pan-Babylonist" mist, which obscured the historical
horizon, vanish before the breath of criticism. It is not the fact that
thousands of years before our era the Chaldeans constructed a learned
and profound cosmology, which established its authority over all
surrounding peoples. But their share in the intellectual and religious
development of antiquity remains none the less most considerable. They
are the creators of chronology and astronomy. They contrived to enlarge
their theology progressively in order to keep it in harmony with their
new conception of the world, and their astrology was regarded as the
method of divination *par excellence*. Their conquests in the realm of
science won such prestige for their beliefs that they spread from the
Far East to the Far West, and even now their sway has not been wholly
overthrown. In mysterious ways they penetrated as far as India, China,
and Indo-China, where divination by means of the stars is still
practised at the present day, and reached perhaps even the primitive
centres of American civilisation. In the opposite direction they spread
to Syria, to Egypt, and over the whole Roman world, where their
influence was to prevail up to the fall of paganism and lasted through
the Middle Ages up to the dawn of modern times. It is this dissemination
throughout the West that we shall rapidly describe in this lecture.

<span id="img_sep"></span> ![](img/sep.jpg)

The exchange of religious ideas between the two rival empires of the
valleys of the Euphrates and the Nile undoubtedly goes back, like their
political relations, to a very remote antiquity. In the fifteenth
century before our era, at the moment when--as the Tell-el-Amarna
tablets show--Babylonian was the diplomatic language of the whole East,
and

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Egypt extended its
empire or its suzerainty over the principalities of Canaan and Syria, we
find Amenophis IV ordaining the exclusive worship of the Sun as lord of
heaven and earth, protector of his person and of his subjects of every
nationality. It is possible that this theological Pharaoh was led by the
influence of Semitic star-worship to impose his attempt at reform upon
the Egyptian clergy. Many other proofs might be advanced to show that
the beliefs and even the cults of the Syrians found their way into the
state of the Pharaohs. But the religious ideas with which we are
particularly concerned here were late in being introduced. Astrology was
*unknown* in ancient Egypt: it was not until the Persian period, about
the sixth century, that it began to be cultivated there. The ascendancy
which it then acquired, succeeded in breaking down the haughty reserve
of the proudest and most exclusive people in the world, and a
conservative clergy was compelled to admit to its ranks calculators of
hours and makers of horoscopes (ὡρολόγοι, ὡροσκόποι) devoted to the
study of Chaldean science. The history of this dissemination confirms
what we said both about the late date of this religious development in
Babylonia and about the irresistible prestige which the brilliant
discoveries of astronomy conferred upon it from the Assyrian period
onwards. This foreign religion was gradually naturalised in Egypt: the
huge zodiacs, which decorated the walls of the temples, show how
sacerdotal teaching succeeded in grafting the learned doctrines of the
Chaldeans on native beliefs and in giving them an original development.
National pride even ended by convincing itself that all this religious
erudition was purely indigenous. About the year 150 B.C. there were
composed in Greek--undoubtedly at Alexandria--the mystic treatises
attributed to the fabulous king Nechepso and his confidant, the priest
Petosiris, which became as it were the sacred books of the growing faith
in the power of the stars. These apocryphal works of a mythical
antiquity were to acquire incredible authority in the Roman world.

The god Tôt (Thoth), the Hermes Trismegistus of the Greeks, became in
Egypt the revealer of the wisdom of horoscopers, as of all other kinds
of wisdom. But it was a difficult task to

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

reconcile astrology with national beliefs, as Hermetism sought to do.
For, astrology was not only a method of divination: it implied, as we
have said, a religious conception of the world, and it was inseparably
combined with Greek philosophy. Thus the Hermetic books comprise not
merely treatises on learned superstition: it is a complete theology that
the gods teach to the faithful in a series of what may be called
apocalypses. This recondite literature, often contradictory, was
apparently developed between 50 B.C. and A.D. 150. It has a considerable
importance in relation to the diffusion throughout the Roman Empire of
certain doctrines of sidereal religion moulded to suit Egyptian ideas.
But it had only a secondary influence. It is not at Alexandria that this
form of paganism was either produced or chiefly developed, but among the
neighbouring Semitic peoples.

Syria, lying as it does nearer than Egypt to Babylon and Nineveh, was
more vividly illumined by the radiance of those great centres of
culture. The ascendancy of an erudite clergy who ruled there, was
extended at an early date over all surrounding countries, eastwards over
Persia, northwards over Cappadocia. But nowhere was it so readily
accepted as among the Syrians, who were united with the Oriental Semites
by community of language and blood.

The very names Σύριοι, "Syrian," and Ἀσσύριοι, "Assyrian," are
originally identical, and for a long time the Greeks made no distinction
between them. The plains of Mesopotamia and Cœle-Syria, inhabited by
kindred races, extended across frontiers which are not marked out by
nature, and, despite all political vicissitudes, relations between the
great temples situated east and west of the Euphrates continued without
interruption.

It is difficult to fix the date at which the influence of the
"Chaldeans" began to be felt in Syria, but it is certainly not later
than the period when the dominion of the Sargonides was extended as far
as the Mediterranean, that is to say, the eighth century B.C.; and
without admitting, with the Pan-Babylonists, that the stories of Genesis
are merely astral myths, we may regard it as indisputable that before
the Exile (597 B.C.) Israel

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

received from Babylon, along with some astronomical knowledge, certain
beliefs connected with star-worship and astrology. We know that idolatry
was repeatedly introduced into Zion. Thus king Manasseh caused the
chariot of Shamash, the Sun-god, to be accepted there; he dared to set
the "Queen of the Heavens" by the side of Iahweh. After the Exile,
spiritual relations were continuous between Judaism and the great
religious metropolis which had subjugated it. As late as the first
century B.C., the author of the Book of Enoch, in his pretended
revelations, is obviously inspired by Babylonian cosmology and legends.

If Israel, which repulsed all forms of polytheism with such inflexible
determination, nevertheless yielded temporarily to the prestige of
star-worship, how much more effectively must this cult have established
its sway over Semitic tribes which had remained pagan? Under its
influence they are seen to adopt new divinities: Bel of Babylon was
worshipped all over northern Syria. The ancient divinities also were
grouped anew: At Hierapolis, as at Heliopolis and Emesa, a new member
was added to the original pair, Baal and Baalat, husband and wife, in
order to form one of those triads of which Chaldean theology was fond.
But this theology profoundly modified, above all, the conception of the
higher powers reverenced by these pastoral or agricultural tribes. Side
by side with their proper nature, it gave to these gods a second
personality, which became none the less prominent because it was
borrowed, and sidereal myths came to be interlined, as it were, with
agrarian myths and soon obliterated them. From being lords of a clan and
a narrow district, the Baals were promoted to the dignity of universal
gods. The old spirit of storm and thunder, Baal Shammin, who dwelt in
the sky, becomes the Most High (Ύ᾽ψιστος), the eternal regulator of
cosmic movements. <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) The naturalistic
and primitive worship which these peoples paid to the Sun, the Moon, and
certain stars such as Venus, was systematised by a doctrine which
constituted the Sun--identified with the Baals, conceived as supreme
gods--the

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

almighty Lord of the world, thus paving the way in the East for the
future transformation of Roman paganism. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)

There can be no doubt that Babylonian doctrines exercised decisive
influence on this gradual metamorphosis and this latest phase of Semitic
religion. The Seleucid princes of Antioch showed as great deference to
the science of the Babylonian clergy as the Persian Achæmenids had done
before them. We find Seleucus Nicator consulting these official
soothsayers about the propitious hour for founding Seleucia on the
Tigris; and, if we may believe Diodorus, <span
id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_51.md) these diviners made to Alexander,
Antigonus, and numerous other monarchs predictions which were fulfilled
to the letter. Antiochus, king of Commagene, who died in 34 B.C., built
on a spur of Mount Taurus, commanding a distant view of the Euphrates
valley, a sepulchral monument on which, side by side with the images of
his ancestral gods, he set the scheme of his nativity figured on a large
bas-relief, <span id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_52.md) because his life had
realised all the promises of this horoscope. The cities of Syria often
stamp on their coins certain signs of the zodiac to mark the fact that
they stood under their patronage. If princes and cities thus
acknowledged the authority of astrology, we may imagine what was the
power of this scientific theology in the temples. We may say that in the
Alexandrine age it permeated the whole of Semitic paganism.

<span id="img_sep"></span> ![](img/sep.jpg)

But in the empire of the Seleucids alongside of this "Chaldaism," if I
may venture to use the term, Hellenism had established itself in a
commanding position. Above the old native beliefs the doctrines of
Stoicism in particular exercised dominion over men's minds. It has often
been observed that the masters of the Stoic school are for the most part
Orientals. Zeno himself was born at Kition in the island of Cyprus.
Among his successors Chrysippus and others belonged to Tarsus in
Cilicia. Diogenes of Babylon, Posidonius of Apamea, Antipater of
Tyre--to mention only the leading representatives

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

of these doctrines--were all Syrians. In a certain sense it may be said
that Stoicism was a Semitic philosophy. Given the fact that it was
always the first care of this school to reconcile itself with
established cults, it is *a priori* certain that Oriental star-worship
did not remain foreign to its system. Had we a more precise knowledge of
Asiatic civilisation during the Hellenistic period, we should be able to
estimate more exactly what Zeno and, above all, his disciples owed to
Chaldean theology and what it owed to them. We have already touched upon
this point. <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md) As it is, we cannot
follow the development of this movement of ideas, which was definitively
to introduce astrology together with star-worship into the philosophy of
the Stoa. The thinker who is almost the sole representative we have of
these syncretic tendencies, despite the fact that they must certainly
have shown themselves long before him and abundantly around him, is
Posidonius of Apamea.

Of the man himself we know almost nothing. Born at Apamea in the valley
of the Orontes about 135 B.C., after long travels in pursuit of his
studies, which took him as far as Gades (Cadiz), he settled in the
island of Rhodes, whither his teaching attracted large numbers of Greeks
and Romans, and he died at the age of eighty-four after an active career
which filled the whole of the first half of the first century. Was he a
pure Syrian, like Porphyry and Iamblichus in later times, or a
descendant of the Macedonian conquerors? Was his mother-tongue Greek or
Aramaic? We should like to know, but we are in total ignorance about the
surroundings amid which this great man grew up; we know nothing of his
society, nothing even of his education, except that he was the pupil of
the Stoic Panætius.

But it is clear that this master, who in his time exercised a real
intellectual sovereignty, owed it above all to the extent of his
knowledge and the largeness of his comprehension. A native of the very
heart of Syria, but naturalised as a Rhodian, Posidonius represented in
all its fulness the alliance of Semitic tradition with Greek thought. He
was the great intermediary and mediator not only between Romans and
Hellenes, but

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

between East and West. Brought up on Plato and Aristotle, he was equally
versed in Asiatic astrology and demonology. If he is Greek in the
constructive power of his speculative genius, in the harmonious flow of
his copious and highly-coloured style, his genius remained Oriental in
the singular combination of the most exact science with a fervent
mysticism. More of a theologian than a philosopher, in mind more learned
than critical, he made all human knowledge conspire to the building up
of a great system, the coping of which was enthusiastic adoration of the
God who permeates the universal organism. In this vast syncretism all
superstitions, popular or sacerdotal, soothsaying, divination, magic,
find their place and their justification; but above all it was due to
him that astrology entered into a coherent explanation of the world,
acceptable to the most enlightened intellects, and that it was solidly
based on a general theory of nature, from which it was to remain
henceforth inseparable.

<span id="img_sep"></span> ![](img/sep.jpg)

The almost total loss of the works of Posidonius prevents us from
appreciating, save in an imperfect manner, the persuasive force of his
teaching. But the echo of his words resounded far through the Roman
dominion, where his authority balanced that of Epicurus. In his school
at Rhodes he had long been the master of the masters of the
world,--Pompey listened to him, Cicero attended his lectures,--and his
influence on the development of later theology was immense in several
directions. His pupil, Cicero, has frequent reminiscences of his
teaching and translates his ideas into Latin. The symbolism of Philo the
Jew is often inspired by his picturesque eloquence. Still later his
ideas pass into and spread throughout the Stoic school--we see them, for
instance, in the works of Seneca,--and they are echoed in the treatises
of the astrologers of the imperial age.

The most striking of the literary productions which he inspired is the
*Astronomics* of the so-called Manilius, a writer of whom we know
absolutely nothing, not even his name, which is corrupt in the
manuscripts, but who was in his own way a genuine poet: A work of
remarkable inspiration, where the

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

brilliance of the descriptions blooms in the wilderness of a dry
"mathematic," where a passionate enthusiasm for the marvels of science
makes us forget that this science is false, where lofty intellectual
ambitions and an unbounded confidence in the power of reason are
combined with a blind and puerile credulity which accepts all
predictions derived from the stars,--this work reveals to us better than
any other the grandeur of such a system of the world as that conceived
by Posidonius and the attraction which was exercised by this learned
cosmology, sustained by a mystic faith in astrology, the revealer of the
future.

The poem is dedicated to Tiberius, who perhaps suggested its
composition, and some have proposed to see in it "the expression of the
official religion of the age." <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md)
Obviously the first Cæsars, even more than the old republican
aristocracy, among whom Posidonius counted so many disciples, would be
inclined to adopt the ideas of one who broke with the old national
particularism, in order to include the worships of all races in one vast
synthesis, and appeared to give to the united Empire the formula of the
theology of the future. Characteristically enough, Augustus as well as
Tiberius had already been converted to astrology, and we shall see how
the later princes granted an official protection to sidereal religion.

With the same movement of ideas, which was initiated or represented by
Posidonius, was connected the revival of a strange sect, that of the
Neo-Pythagoreans, which re-appeared in the East during the first half of
the first century before our era. Although by its ideal of religious
life it professed to connect itself with the old Pythagorean mysticism,
its doctrine owes more to the theories developed by Posidonius,
especially in his commentary on the *Timaeus*, and it borrowed much,
either through the medium of the great Syrian or even directly, from
Oriental religions. A marked dualism, which contrasts the soul with the
body, and, as a consequence, a moral asceticism, a doctrine of the
eternity of the universe and of the influence of the stars on the
constant changes of the sublunary world, a belief in airy demons who
defile and torment mankind, but above all--and this is the central point
and the core of its

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

dogmatic system--a symbolism of numbers, to which is attributed an
active force and a mystic power, all these essential features indicate a
singularly close connection between Neo-Pythagorism and "Chaldean"
theology. It is characteristic that the man who first revived at Rome
the old South-Italian philosophy, Nigidius Figulus, the friend of
Cicero, displays a curious interest in magic and in occult lore, and an
ardent devotion to astrology, and that he was the first to expound in
Latin the significance of the "barbaric sphere," that is to say, a
series of constellations not recognised by the Greek astronomers but
adopted in Oriental uranography. <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md)

But these groups of cultured theosophists addressed them-selves only to
limited circles of "intellectuals." In a general way the new sidereal
religion was from the first welcomed by the upper classes: it was
cultivated by the aristocracy both of blood and of intellect. If it had
continued to be preached only by polytheistic theorists, it would have
remained, as in Greece, the exclusive preserve of a few speculative
minds. Even the inspiration of a semi-official poet like Manilius would
hardly have won for it the favour of the imperial court. And yet it
achieved a widespread popularity. Its influence over the masses it did
not owe to a literary diffusion, whatever may have been the success of
certain romances which were inspired by it, such as the life of
Apollonius by Philostratus and, still more, the *Ethiopics* of
Heliodorus. It had in its service other missionaries, whose active
propagandism spread it through the mixed populace of the towns as well
as among the hosts of slaves who tilled the country estates. These
popular propagandists were the clergy and the devotees of Oriental
cults.

<span id="img_sep"></span> ![](img/sep.jpg)

Towards the commencement of our era, when the peace and unity of the
ancient world was assured by the foundation of the Empire, began the
development of this great religious movement which little by little was
to orientalise Roman paganism. The gods of the nations of the Levant
imposed themselves, one after another, on the West. Cybele and Attis
were transported

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

from Phrygia, Isis and Serapis travelled thither from Alexandria.
Merchants, soldiers, and slaves brought the Baals of Syria and Mithra,
an immigrant from the heart of Persia. We have attempted in another
volume to show in what respects each of these foreign cults enriched the
creeds of Rome. <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md) The point which I
desire to emphasise here, is that all of them, no matter what their
origin, were influenced in different degrees by astrology and
star-worship. These doctrines, as we have seen, grew up among the
temples of Syria and Egypt, and transformed the theology of these
countries more and more. Originally the mysteries of Isis and Serapis,
established under the first Ptolemy, allowed them only a limited place,
but in the time of Nero his teacher Chæremon, a priest of Alexandria and
a Stoic philosopher, re-discovered in the religion of Egypt the worship
of the powers of nature and, in particular, of the stars, and found
again in prayer a means of rescuing men from the fatality which the
influence of the heavenly bodies imposed upon them. Even in Asia Minor,
where the sidereal cult is adventitious and recent, a member of a
considerable family of Phrygian prelates is found celebrating in verse
the sidereal divination which enabled him to publish far and wide
infallible predictions. Attis, the Anatolian deity of vegetation, ended
by becoming a solar god, just like Serapis, the Baals, and Mithra. In
very early times, even in Mesopotamia, star-worship was imposed upon
Persian Mazdaism, which was still a collection of traditions and rites
rather than a body of doctrines, and a set of abstruse dogmas came to be
super-imposed on the naturalistic myths of the Iranians. The mysteries
of Mithra imported into Europe this composite theology, off-spring of
the intercourse between Magi and Chaldeans; and the signs of the zodiac,
the symbols of the planets, the emblems of the elements, appear time
after time on the bas-reliefs, mosaics, and paintings of their
subterranean temples. We find one of the members of their clergy
proclaimed in his epitaph at Milan *studiosus astrologiae*. <span
id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_57.md) The priests of the Persian god and

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

those of the so-called "Jupiters" of Syria contributed largely to the
triumph of this pseudo-science, which towards the age of the Severi
acquired an almost undisputed supremacy even in the Latin world.

Here it no longer presents itself as a learned theory taught by
mathematicians, but as a sacred doctrine revealed to the adepts of
exotic cults, which have all assumed the form of mysteries. The doctrine
which is thus communicated to the initiated in the dim light of temples,
undoubtedly remained more sacerdotal than, for instance, the
*Tetrabiblos* of Ptolemy, a dry didactic treatise which could never have
fostered any devotion. Here more room was left for mythology, mysticism,
ethics, and superstition. This theology, however, had not escaped the
prevailing ascendancy of Greek philosophy, any more than had the ideas
of the most learned casters of nativities,--this is a fact which
research has succeeded in proving. In reality these mysteries, which
professed to be the depositaries of an ancient tradition imported from
the Far East, constantly modified their teaching, in order to adapt it
to altered times and environments; and if the wisdom which they revealed
was always regarded as divine, it nevertheless varied remarkably in the
course of ages and admitted ideas entirely foreign to its original
content. This was a necessary consequence of the close union of learning
and belief which, as we have said, characterises Oriental religions.
They were always the expression of a given conception of the world,
which determined the relations of heaven and earth and the duties of the
faithful towards the gods. Hence they were bound to change in conformity
with the evolution of physical or metaphysical ideas. If Greek thought
could receive certain impulses or suggestions from the temples of Syria
and Egypt, it invaded them in turn as a conqueror: and Stoicism in
particular certainly gave to them more than it received from them. The
great intellectual movement of which Posidonius was not so much the
initiator as the most illustrious representative, undoubtedly combined
devotion and philosophy, but it also introduced philosophy into
devotion. The learned and mystic system of doctrine, which Manilius and
others preached under Tiberius, imposed itself

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

on all Western paganism in the course of the following centuries; and we
may say, making allowance for certain modifications, that this
half-scientific, half-religious system, which was established in the
Alexandrine period, continued to be the theology of the mysteries up to
the time of their disappearance, even after the advent of Neo-Platonism.

As a characteristic production of this medley of ideas may be quoted
those *Chaldean Oracles*, <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) whose
origin is still a mystery, but which appear to have been compiled in the
second century of our era. In these works of fantastic mysticism, in
which the whole Neo-Platonic school saw the revelation of supreme
wisdom, ancient beliefs of Semitic star-worship are combined with
Hellenic theories. They are to Babylon what the Hermetic literature is
to Egypt.

<span id="img_sep"></span> ![](img/sep.jpg)

Thus the triumph of Oriental religions was simultaneously the triumph of
astral religion, but to secure recognition by all pagan peoples, it
needed an official sanction. The influence which it had acquired among
the populace, was finally assured when the emperors lent it an
interested support. That apotheosis by which from the beginning of the
principate deceased princes were raised to the stars, is inspired both
in form and spirit by Asiatic doctrines. We have seen that already
Augustus and especially Tiberius allowed themselves to be converted to
the ideas of the disciples of Posidonius. But they remained hostile to
the popular forms of foreign worships, at least in their capital. Their
ideal, which was entirely political, is the restoration of the old Roman
faith and respect for the purely practical cult of the city. But in
proportion as Cæsarism became more and more transformed into absolute
monarchy, it tended more and more to lean for support on the Oriental
clergy. These priests, loyal to the traditions of the Achæmenids and the
Pharaohs, preached doctrines which tended to elevate sovereigns above
mankind, and they supplied the emperors with a dogmatic justification of
their despotism. For the old

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

principle of the sovereignty of the people, the original form of
Cæsarism, was substituted a reasoned belief in supernatural influences.
The emperor is the image of the Sun on earth, like him invincible and
eternal (*invictus*, *aeternus*), as his official title declares.
Already in the eyes of the Babylonians the Sun was the royal planet, and
it is he that in Rome continues to give to his chosen ones the virtues
of sovereignty, and destines them for the throne from the time of their
appearance on earth. He remains in close communion with them, he is
their companion (*comes*) and their congener, for they are united by
community of nature. It may be said that they are consubstantial; and in
the third century the monarch was worshipped as "god and master by right
of birth" (*deus et dominus natus*), who had descended from heaven by
grace of the Sun, and by his grace will reascend thither again after
death. The idea that the monarch's soul, at the moment when destiny
caused it to descend to this world, received from the Star of the day
its sovereign power, led to the inference that he participated in the
might of this divinity, and was its representative on earth. Thus it is
noticeable that the princes who proclaimed most loudly their autocratic
pretensions, a Domitian or a Commodus, were also those who most openly
favoured Oriental cults.

These cults attained the zenith of their power when the advent of the
Severi brought them the support of a half-Syrian Court. For nearly half
a century, from A.D. 193 to 235, the Empire was governed by a family of
Emesa, an ancient sacerdotal state, where on the edge of the Syrian
desert rose the splendid temple of Elagabalus. Intelligent and ambitious
princesses, Julia Domna, Sohæmias, Mæsa, and Mammæa, whose intellectual
ascendancy was so considerable, became missionaries of their national
religion. Officials of all ranks, senators and officers, rivalled each
other in devotion to the gods who protected their sovereigns and were
protected by them. You all know the bold proclamation of A.D. 218 which
set upon the throne a boy of fourteen years, priest of Elagabalus, whose
name he bore. The Greeks named him Heliogabalus in order to recall the
solar character of this god. To this barbarous divinity, hitherto rather
obscure, he sought to give the primacy

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

over all the others. Ancient authors relate with indignation how this
crowned priest desired to elevate the black stone of his god, a rude
idol brought from Emesa, to the rank of sovereign divinity of the
Empire, subordinating the entire pantheon of antiquity to *Sol Invictus
Elagabal*, as he is termed in inscriptions. The attempt of Heliogabalus
to establish in heaven a kind of solar monotheism corresponding to the
monarchy that ruled on earth, was doubtless too violent, tactless, and
premature: it miscarried and provoked the assassination of its author.

But it corresponded to the aspirations of the day and it was renewed
half a century later, this time with complete success. In 274, Aurelian
was inspired with the same idea, when he created a new cult of the
"Invincible Sun." Worshipped in a splendid temple, served by pontiffs
who were raised to the level of the ancient pontiffs of Rome, celebrated
every fourth year by magnificent games, *Sol Invictus* was definitively
promoted to the highest rank in the divine hierarchy and became the
official protector of the Sovereigns and of the Empire. The country in
which Aurelian discovered the model which he sought to reproduce was
Syria, where he had won a decisive victory over the famous queen
Zenobia: he placed in his new sanctuary the images of Bel and Helios,
which he captured at Palmyra. In establishing this new State cult,
Aurelian in reality proclaimed the dethronement of the old Roman
idolatry and the accession of Semitic Sun-worship.

With Constantius Chlorus (A.D. 305) there ascended the throne a solar
dynasty which, connecting itself with Claudius II Gothicus, a votary of
the worship of Apollo, professed to have *Sol Invictus* as its special
protector and ancestor. Even the Christian emperors, Constantine and
Constantius, did not altogether forget the pretensions which they could
derive from so illustrious a descent, and the last pagan who occupied
the throne of the Cæsars, Julian the Apostate, has left us a discourse
in which, in the style of a subtle theologian and a fervent devotee, he
justifies the adoration of the King Star, of whom he considered himself
the spiritual son and heaven-sent champion.

<span id="img_sep"></span> ![](img/sep.jpg)

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

If in conclusion we survey at a glance the whole course of the expansion
which we have tried to describe, we shall be struck with the power of
this sidereal theology, founded on ancient beliefs of Chaldean
astrologers, transformed in the Hellenistic age under the twofold
influence of astronomic discoveries and Stoic thought, and promoted,
after becoming a pantheistic Sun-worship, to the rank of official
religion of the Roman Empire. Preached on the one hand by men of letters
and by men of science in centres of culture, diffused on the other hand
among the bulk of the people by the servitors of Semitic, Persian or
Egyptian gods, it is finally patronised by the emperors, who find in it
at once a form of worship suitable for all their subjects and a
justification of their autocratic pretensions.

In this way the astrological conception of life and of the world
permeated the whole of society, and in particular produced a revolution
in the beliefs of the Latin world. Despite all the speculations of
metaphysicians, the masses had remained on the whole true to the old
idolatry of the Republican period. Oriental theology led to the
prevalence of a more lofty idea of God. In the declining days of
antiquity the common creed of all pagans came to be a scientific
pantheism, in which the infinite power of the divinity that pervaded the
universe was revealed by all the elements of nature. In the following
lectures we shall have to examine more closely this conception of the
