# Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos

## tr. J.M. Ashmand

#### \[1822\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tetrabiblos, or 'four-part book' of Ptolemy is one of the most
important surviving ancient texts on Astrology. Claudius Ptolemy, the
second century C.E. author of this book, is best known as the originator
of the Ptolemaic system. The Earth stood fixed at the center of the
universe, with crystalline spheres within spheres whirling around it. In
balance, the universe had a vast influence on earthly events, which was
the basis for the belief in Astrology. This explanation stood for nearly
a millenium and a half, bolstered by its acceptance as orthodoxy by the
Catholic Church, until Copernicus and Galileo demolished it and placed
the heliocentric (sun-centered) system in its place.
