### CHAPTER X

### COLOURS IN ECLIPSES; COMETS, AND SIMILAR PHENOMENA

IN investigating general events, it is necessary further to observe the
colours or hues displayed during an eclipse, either in the luminaries,
or around them; in the shape of rods or rays, or in other similar forms.
For, if these colours or hues should be black, or greenish, they portend
effects similar to those produced by Saturn's nature; if white, to those
operated by Jupiter; if reddish, to those by Mars; if yellow, to those
by Venus; and if of various colours, to those by Mercury.

And, if the entire bodies of the luminaries be thus coloured, or should
the hues extend over all the parts immediately circumjacent to the
luminaries, it is an indication that the effects will attach to most
parts of the region, or countries, with which the eclipse and its ruling
places may be in familiarity. If, however, the colouring should not
spread over the whole surface of the luminaries, nor over all the parts
around them, but be limited to some particular quarter, then only such a
portion of the said countries, as may be indicated by the situation of
the visible hues, will be comprehended in the event.

It is also requisite to notice, with respect to general events, the
risings or first appearances of those celestial phenomena called comets,
whether presenting themselves at ecliptical times or at any other
periods. They are displayed in the shape of beams, trumpets, pipes, and
in other similar figures, and operate effects like those of Mars and
Mercury; exciting wars, heated and turbulent dispositions in the
atmosphere, and in the constitutions of men, with all their evil
consequences. The parts of the zodiac <span
id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_108.md) in which they may be posited when they
first appear, and the direction and inclination of their trains, point
out the regions or places liable to be affected by the events which they
threaten; and the form of the signs indicates the quality and nature of
those events, as well as the genus, class, or kind, on which the effect
will fall. The

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

time of their continuance shows the duration of their effect; and their
position, with regard to the Sun, the period when it will commence; as,
if they first appear matutine, they denote an early commencement; but,
if vespertine, that it will be late and tardy.

The general and more comprehensive parts of the consideration regarding
regions, countries, and cities, having now been explained, it becomes
necessary to discuss certain particular points of the same
consideration; that is to say, the annual occurrences which take place
at certain fixed seasons, and the chief of which is that called the New
Moon of the Year.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_108"></span>[62:1](ptb40.htm#fr_108.md) When a comet appears
out of the zodiac, a line should be drawn from one zodiacal pole to the
other, through the spot where it appears; and that spot is to be
considered as being in familiarity with the same countries as those
parts of the zodiac which may be on the same line.--*Vide* Chap. IV of
this Book, relative to the manner in which fixed stars out of the zodiac
hold familiarity with certain regions and countries.
