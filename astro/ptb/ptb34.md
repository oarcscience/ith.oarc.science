### CHAPTER IV

### THE FAMILIARITY OF THE REGIONS OF THE EARTH WITH THE FIXED STARS

IN addition to the rules which have been already given, respecting the
familiarity of the regions of the earth with the signs and planets, it
must be observed, that all fixed stars which may be posited on any line,
drawn from one zodiacal pole to the other, through such parts of the
zodiac as may be connected with any particular country, are also in
familiarity with that particular country.

And, with regard to metropolitan cities, it is necessary to state, that
those points or degrees of the zodiac, over which the Sun and Moon were
in transit, at the time when the construction of any such city was first
undertaken and commenced, are to be considered as sympathizing with that
city in an especial manner; and that, among the angles, the ascendant is
principally in accordance with it. In certain cases, however, where the
date of foundation of a metropolis cannot be ascertained, the mid-heaven
in the nativity of the reigning king, or other actual chief magistrate,
is to be substituted, and considered as that part of the zodiac with
which it chiefly sympathizes. <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_93"></span>[52:1](ptb34.htm#fr_93) Whalley remarks on this
passage, that the gradual progress of the fixed stars "from one sign to
another, is in an especial manner to be regarded in considering the
mutations, manners, customs, laws, government, and fortune of a
kingdom."
