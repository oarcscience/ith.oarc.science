### CHAPTER XIX

### THE DISEASES OF THE MIND

IN connection with the foregoing discussion on the properties of the
mind, the circumstances relating to eminent mental disorders, such as
madness, epilepsy; <span id="fr_220"></span>[1](#fn_220.md) and others of
the like formidable nature, duly claim attention.

Now, with reference to these, it is always essential to consider the
planet Mercury and the Moon, and to observe in what mode they may be
disposed towards each other, and towards the angles, and also to-wards
the malefics: for, if the Moon and Mercury be unconnected with each
other, or with the oriental horizon, and provided such planets as may be
adversely and noxiously configurated should be in elevation above them,
or overrule them, or be in opposition to them, the mental properties
will then consequently become impregnated with various disorders: the
characters of which may be clearly known by the qualities of the stars
thus controlling the places. <span id="fr_221"></span>[2](#fn_221.md)

It is true that there are many disorders of a moderate nature, capable
of being distinguished by what has been already stated, in the preceding
chapter, regarding the mental qualities: for it is by the increase and
growth of certain of those qualities, that an injurious excess is
produced; and every irregularity of the moral habit, whether by
deficiency or superabundance, may be fitly termed a moral disorder. But,
at the same time, there are other disorders of so vast and manifold a
disproportion, that they quite, as it were, overpower the natural course
of the intellect and passions of the mind. And of these greater
disorders it is now proposed to treat.

For example, epilepsy generally attaches to all persons born when
Mercury and the Moon may be unconnected either with each other, or with
the oriental horizon, while Saturn and Mars may be in angles and
superintend the scheme; that is to say, provided Saturn be so posited by
day, and Mars by night: otherwise, when the converse may happen in these
schemes, viz. when Saturn may have dominion by night, but Mars by day
(especially if in Cancer, Virgo or Pisces), the persons born will become
insane. And they will become demoniac, and afflicted with moisture, of
the brain, if the Moon, being in face to the Sun, should be governed by
Saturn when operating her conjunction, but by Mars when effecting her
opposition; and particularly when it may happen in Sagittarius and in
Pisces.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

If the malefics, only, should have ruled the scheme, in the manner
described, the said disorders of the mind will become irremediable,
although at the same time not eminent, but doubtful, and not openly
displayed but, should the benefics, Jupiter and Venus, be conciliated,
and be posited in eastern parts and in angles, while the malefics may be
in western parts, the disorders, although highly conspicuous, will then
be susceptible to cure. For instance, under Jupiter's influence, they
will be healed by means of medical or surgical aid, and by diet and
medicine; under Venus, by the guidance of oracles and by divine
interposition.

Should the benefics, however, be occidental, and the malefics be found
in eastern parts and in angles, the disorders will then become not only
incurable, but most conspicuous: the epileptic persons will then be
subjected to constant fits, and to danger of death; the insane will
become outrageous and unmanageable, breaking away from their families,
raving and wandering in nakedness: the demoniacs and those afflicted
with moisture of the brain will become furious, uttering mysterious
sayings, and wounding themselves.

The several places of position in the scheme also afford co-operation:
for instance, those of the Sun and Mars contribute to insanity; those of
Jupiter and Mercury, to epilepsy; those of Venus, to the fury of
enthusiasm; and those of Saturn and the Moon, to demoniac affections and
moisture of the brain.

It is by such configurations, as those just described, that any morbid
deviation, occurring in the active or reasoning faculties of the mind,
is produced; but a deviation of the passive, or merely sensitive
faculties, is discernible chiefly in the excess and deficiency (as the
case may be) of the masculine and feminine genders; that is to say, in
the superabundance, or deficiency, of the power of either gender, to
produce a conformation agreeable to its own proper nature: and a
knowledge of this latter deviation is to be acquired by means of the
following rules.

When the Sun, instead of Mercury, may be with the Moon, and if Mars,
together with Venus, be then in familiarity with them, in that case,
provided the luminaries only be found in masculine signs, men will excel
in their nature, or, in other words, will possess in full plenitude the
properties becoming their sex; while the properties of women, who are
thus constituted more masculinely and more actively, will deviate from
the usual limits of nature. But, if both Mars and Venus, or if only one
of them, be likewise masculinely situated, men will be freely and
promptly inclined to natural intercourse and connexion; and women will
be, in like manner, licentious and intemperate in intercourse beyond
nature. Their desires will be practised in privacy, and not openly,
should only Venus be situated masculinely; but shamelessly and publicly,
if Mars also masculinely placed, together with Venus.

But, if the luminaries only be in feminine signs, women will then

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

possess their natural functions in greater plenitude, and men will
deviate from the limits of nature towards effeminacy and wantonness.
And, if Venus be femininely posited, women will be lustful and
licentious, and men wanton and soft; seeking connexion contrary to
nature; yet in privacy and not openly: but, if Mars be posited
femininely, they will then put their desires in practice shamelessly and
publicly.

The oriental and diurnal positions of Mars and Venus also contribute to
more masculine and more reputable qualities; and their occidental and
vespertine <span id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_222.md) positions to qualities
more feminine, and more sordid.

Lastly, if Saturn be in familiarity with them, he will likewise
co-operate, by tending to produce greater impurity and obscenity, and
greater evil altogether; but Jupiter, if in familiarity, tends to
greater decency and modesty, and altogether to better conduct; and
Mercury to greater mobility, diversity, activity, and notoriety of the
passions.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[114:1](ptb63.htm#fr_220.md) Epilepsy is defined
to be "a conclusive motion of the whole body, or some parts of its
parts, accompanied with a loss of sense." The knowledge of this latter
effect probably induced the author to rank it among diseases of the
mind.
