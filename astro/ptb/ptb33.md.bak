### CHAPTER III

### THE FAMILIARITY OF THE REGIONS OF THE EARTH WITH THE TRIPLICITIES AND THE PLANETS

IT has been already stated that there are four triplicities
distinguishable in the zodiac. The first, composed of Aries, Leo, and
Sagittarius, is the north-west triplicity; and Jupiter has chief
dominion over it on behalf of its northern proportion; but Mars also
rules with him in reference to the west. The second, consisting of
Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, is the south-east; and in this triplicity
Venus bears chief rule, in consequence of the southern proportion; but
Saturn also governs with her in consideration of the east. The third,
composed of Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius, is north-east; and Saturn is
here the principal lord, in consequence of the eastern proportion;
Jupiter, however, governs with him in reference to the north. The fourth
triplicity is constituted of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces, and is
south-west; it owns Mars as its principal ruler, in consideration of its
western proportion; and, on behalf of the south, it is also governed by
Venus.

The four triplicities being thus established, the whole inhabited earth
is accordingly divided into four parts, agreeing with the number of the
triplicities. It is divided latitudinally by the line of the
Mediterranean Sea, from the Straits of Hercules to the Issican Gulf,
continued onwards through the mountainous ridge extending towards the
east; and by this latitudinal division its southern and northern parts
are defined. Its longitudinal division is made by the line of the
Arabian Gulf, the Ægean Sea, Pontus, and the lake Mæotis; and by this
line are separated its eastern and western parts.

Of the four quadrants of the earth, thus agreeing in number with the
four triplicities, one is situated in the north-west of the entire
earth, and contains Celto-galatia; or, as it is commonly called, Europe.
Opposed to this quadrant lies that of the south-east, towards Eastern
Æthiopia; it is called the southern part of Asia Magna. Another quadrant
of the entire earth is in the north-east, about Scythia, and is called
the northern part of Asia Magna. To this is opposed the quadrant of the
south-west, which lies about Western Æthiopia, and is known by the
general name of Libya.

Each of these quadrants contains certain parts, which, in comparison
with its other parts, lie more contiguous to the middle of the earth;
and these parts, in respect of the quadrant to which they belong, have a
situation opposite to the rest of that quadrant, in the same manner as
that quadrant itself is situated in regard to the rest of the earth. For
instance, in the quadrant of Europe, which is situated on the north-west
of the whole earth, those parts of it which lie towards the middle of
the earth, and near the angles of the other quadrants, are manifestly

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

situated in the south-east of that quadrant. The like rule obtains in
regard to the other quadrants. And hence it is evident that each
quadrant is in familiarity with two oppositely-placed triplicities, its
whole extent being adapted to the one triplicity which governs it as an
entire quadrant; but its particular parts, situated about the middle of
the earth, and lying, as regards the rest of the quadrant, in a
direction contrary to that assigned to the whole quadrant altogether,
being adapted to the other triplicity which rules the particular
quadrant lying opposite to it. The planets exercising dominion in both
these triplicities also hold familiarity with these particular parts;
but, with the other more remote parts of any quadrant, only those
planets hold familiarity which rule in the single triplicity to which
the whole quadrant is allotted. With the said particular parts about the
middle of the earth, Mercury also, as well as the other planets in
dominion, bears familiarity, in consideration of his meditative
condition and common nature.

Under this arrangement, it follows that the north-western parts of the
first quadrant, or that of Europe, are in familiarity with the
north-west triplicity, composed of Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius; and they
are accordingly governed by the lords of that triplicity, Jupiter and
Mars, vespertine. These parts, as distinguished by their appropriation
to entire nations, are Britain, Galatia, Germany, Barsania, <span
id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md) Italy, Apulia, Sicily, Gaul, Tuscany,
Celtica, and Spain. And, since the triplicity itself and the planets
connected with it in dominion are adapted to command, the natives of
these countries are consequently impatient of restraint, lovers of
freedom, warlike, industrious, imperious, cleanly, and high-minded. But,
owing to the vespertine configuration of Jupiter and Mars, as well as
the masculine condition of the anterior parts of the triplicity, and the
feminine condition of its latter parts, <span
id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_81.md) the said nations regard women with scorn
and indifference. <span id="fr_82"></span>[3](#fn_82.md) They are, however,
still careful of the community, brave and faithful, affectionate in
their families, and perform good and kind actions.

Among the countries before named, Britain, Galatia, Germany, and
Barsania have a greater share of familiarity with Aries and Mars; and
their inhabitants are accordingly wilder, bolder, and more ferocious.
Italy, Apulia, Sicily, and Gaul are in familiarity with Leo and the Sun;

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

and the natives of these countries are more imperious, yet kind and
benevolent, and careful of the commonwealth. Tuscany, Celtica, and
Spain, are connected with Sagittarius and Jupiter; and their inhabitants
are lovers of freedom, simplicity, and elegance.

The south-eastern parts of this quadrant, which are situated towards the
middle of the earth, viz. Thrace, Macedonia, Illyria, Hellas, Achaia,
and Crete, as well as the Cyclad Isles and the shores of Asia Minor and
of Cyprus, assume, in addition, a connection with the south-east
triplicity, which is composed of Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, and ruled
by Venus and Saturn; and, in consequence of the vicinity of these
regions to the middle of the earth, Mercury likewise has a proportionate
dominion over them. Hence their inhabitants, being subjected to the
rulers of both triplicities, enjoy a favourable temperament of mind and
of body. From Mars they imbibe their fitness for command, their courage,
and impatience of restraint; from Jupiter their love of freedom, their
self-rule, their skill in guiding public affairs, and in legislation:
through the influence of Venus they are also lovers of the arts and
sciences, as well as of music and poetry, of public shows, and all the
refinements of life; and from Mercury they deduce their hospitality,
their fondness for society and communion, their love of equity and of
literature, and their power of eloquence. They are also in the highest
degree conversant with sacred mysteries, owing to the vespertine
figuration of Venus.

It is further to be observed of these last-named countries, that the
inhabitants of the Cyclad Isles, and of the shores of Asia Minor and of
Cyprus, are more particularly under the influence of Taurus and Venus,
and are therefore voluptuous, fond of elegance, and over-studious in
their attention to the body. The people of Hellas, Achaia, and Crete,
have a stronger familiarity with Virgo and Mercury, and are therefore
learned and scientific, preferring the cultivation of the mind to the
care of the body. The people of Macedonia, Thrace, and Illyria, are
chiefly influenced by Capricorn and Saturn; whence they are greedy of
wealth, inferior in civilization, and have no ordinances of civil
polity.

The second quadrant consists of the southern division of Asia Magna.
Such of its parts as are contained in India, Arriana, Gedrosia, Parthia,
Media, Persia, Babylonia, Mesopotamia, and Assyria, are situated in the
south-east of the whole earth, and have due familiarity with the
south-east triplicity (composed of Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn), and
consequently with Venus, Mercury, and Saturn, in matutine figuration.
The nature of the inhabitants of these countries is obedient to the
dominion of these ruling influences; they worship Venus under the name
of Isis; and they also pay devotion to Saturn, invoking him by the name
of Mithranhelios. Many of them likewise foretell future events; and they
consecrate to the gods some of their bodily members, to which
superstition they are induced by the nature of the figuration of the

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

planets before mentioned. <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md) They are,
moreover, hot in constitution, amorous and lustful, fond of acting,
singing, and dancing, gaudy in their dresses and ornaments; owing to the
influence of Venus. Saturn, however, inclines them to simplicity of
conduct; and, in consequence of the matutine figuration, they address
their women publicly. <span id="fr_84"></span>[2](#fn_84.md) There are also
many among them who beget children by their own mothers. <span
id="fr_85"></span>[3](#fn_85.md) The matutine figurations also influence
their mode of worship, which is performed by prostration of the breast;
because the heart is the nobler part of the body, and, in its vivifying
faculties, acts like the Sun. And, although the influence of Venus makes
the people, generally speaking, finical and effeminate in their personal
adornment and apparel, yet the connection which Saturn holds with them,
by means of the east, still renders them great in mind, eminent in
council, courageous and warlike.

It is to be remarked, that Parthia, Media, and Persia, have a more
particular familiarity with Taurus and Venus; whence it follows that the
dwellers in those countries wear splendid garments, and clothe the whole
person entirely, except the breast; they are also fond of elegance and
refinement. The countries about Babylon, Mesopotamia, and Assyria, are
connected with Virgo and Mercury; their inhabitants are consequently
studious of the sciences, and, among other attainments, excel in making
observations on the five planets. India, Arriana, and Gedrosia, are
connected with Capricorn and Saturn; the natives of these regions are,
therefore, ill-formed in person, of dirty habits, and barbarous manners.

The remaining parts of this second quadrant, viz. Idumæa, Cœlesyria,
Judæa, Phœnicia, Chaldæa, Orchynia, and Arabia Felix, occupy a situation
in the vicinity of the middle of the earth, and in the north-west of the
quadrant to which they actually belong: hence they are in familiarity
with the north-west triplicity (which consists of Aries, Leo, and
Sagittarius), and they have for their rulers, Jupiter and Mars, together
with Mercury. By means of the figuration of these planets, the natives
of the said countries are skilful in trade and all mercantile affairs,
heedless of danger, yet treacherous, servile, and thoroughly fickle.

The inhabitants of Cœlesyria, Idumæa, and Judæa, are principally
influenced by Aries and Mars, and are generally audacious,
atheistical, <span id="fr_86"></span>[4](#fn_86.md)

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

and treacherous. The Phœnicians, Chaldæans, and Orchynians, have
familiarity with Leo and the Sun, and are therefore more simple and
humane in disposition; they are also studious of astrology, and pay
greater reverence than all other nations to the Sun. The people of
Arabia Felix are connected with Sagittarius and Jupiter: the country is
fertile, and abundantly productive of spices, and its inhabitants are
well-proportioned in person, free in all their habits of life, and
liberal in all their contracts and dealings.

The third quadrant occupies the northern division of Asia Magna. Those
several parts of it which lie to the north-east of the whole earth, and
comprise Hyrcania, Armenia, Mantiana, Bactriana, Casperia, Serica,
Sauromatica, Oxiana, and Sogdiana, are in familiarity with the
north-east triplicity, composed of Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius, and have
for their rulers Saturn and Jupiter, in matutine positions; hence the
inhabitants worship Jupiter and the Sun. <span
id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87.md) They are abundantly rich in all things:
they possess much gold, and are dainty and luxurious in their diet. They
are also learned in theology, skilled in magic, just in all their
dealings, free and noble-minded, holding dishonesty and wickedness in
abhorrence, strongly imbued with the softer affections of nature; and,
in a worthy cause, they will even readily embrace death to preserve
their friends. They are, furthermore, chaste in marriage, elegant and
splendid in their dress, charitable and beneficent, and of enlightened
intellect. All these qualities are principally produced by the matutine
positions of Saturn and Jupiter, who influence the region.

Among these nations, however, Hyrcania, Armenia, and Mantiana, have a
greater familiarity with Gemini and Mercury; and the in-habitants are
consequently more acute in apprehension, but less tenacious of their
probity. The countries about Bactriana, Casperia, and Serica, are
connected with Libra and Venus; and the natives are endowed with much
wealth and many luxuries, and take delight in poetry and songs. The
nations about Sauromatica, Oxiana and Sogdiana, are influenced by
Aquarius and Saturn; and are therefore less polished in manners, and
more austere and uncouth.

The other parts of this quadrant, lying near the middle of the entire
earth, consist of Bithynia, Phrygia, Colchis, Laxica, Syria, Commagene,
Cappadocia, Lydia, Lycia, Cilicia, and Pamphylia. These, being situated
in the south-west of their quadrant, have familiarity accordingly with
the south-west triplicity, composed of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces,

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

and are ruled by Mars and Venus, together with Mercury. In these
countries Venus is principally worshipped; she is invoked as the Mother
of the Gods, and by various local and indigenous appellations; Mars
likewise receives adoration here, under the name of Adonis, as well as
by other titles; <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88.md) and some of the
religious services to these deities are performed by loud lamentations.
The people are servile in mind, diligent in labour, yet fraudulent,
knavish, and thievish; they enter into foreign armies for the sake of
hire, and make prisoners and slaves of their own countrymen: besides
which, they are continually subject to intestine broils. These traits
arise from the matutine figurations of Mars and Venus. It is further to
be observed, that, from the circumstance of Mars receiving his
exaltation in Capricorn (one of the signs of the triplicity ruled by
Venus), and Venus hers in Pisces (a sign belonging to the triplicity of
Mars), it thence follows that the women have strong attachments and
kindly affections to their husbands, are vigilant and careful in
domestic affairs, and highly industrious: they also act as servants, and
labour for the men, with all due obedience, in every thing.

Bithynia, Phrygia, and Colchis, must however be excepted from sharing in
this general propriety of the female character; for, as these nations
are chiefly connected with Cancer and the Moon, their male population
is, generally speaking, slavish in its habits, timid and superstitious,
while the greater part of the women, owing to the matutine and masculine
position of the Moon, are of masculine manners, ambitious of command,
and warlike. These females, like the Amazons, shun the addresses of men,
and delight in the use of arms, and in manly occupations: they also
amputate the right breasts of their female children for the sake of
adapting them to military service, and in order that, when in combat and
exposing that part of their body, they may appear to be of the male sex.
Again, Syria, Commagene, and Cappadocia, are principally influenced by
Scorpio and Mars; and their inhabitants are accordingly bold, wicked,
treacherous, and laborious. Lydia, Cilicia, and Pamphylia, have a
greater familiarity with Pisces and Jupiter; when their inhabitants are
wealthy, of mercantile habits, living in freedom and in community,
faithful to their engagements, and honest in their dealings.

The remaining quadrant is the vast tract known by the general name of
Libya. Its several parts, distinguished by the particular names of
Numidia, Carthage, Africa. <span id="fr_89"></span>[2](#fn_89.md) Phazania,
Nasamonitis, Garamantica,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Mauritania, Getulia, and Metagonitis, are
situated in the south-west of the entire earth, and have due familiarity
with the south-west triplicity, composed of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces;
their rulers therefore are Mars and Venus, in vespertine position. From
this figuration of the planets it results that the dwellers in these
regions are doubly governed by a man and a woman, who are both children
of the same mother; the man rules the males, and the woman the females.
They are extremely hot in constitution, and desirous of women; their
marriages are usually made by violence, and in many districts the local
princes first enjoy the brides of their subjects: in some places,
however, the women are common to all. The influence of Venus causes the
whole people to delight in personal ornaments, and in being arrayed in
female attire: nevertheless, that of Mars renders them courageous,
crafty, addicted to magic, and fearless of dangers.

Again, however, of the above-named countries, Numidia, Carthage, and
Africa, are more particularly in familiarity with Cancer and the Moon:
their inhabitants, consequently, live in community, attend to mercantile
pursuits, and enjoy abundantly all the blessings of nature. The natives
of Metagonitis, Mauritania, and Getulia, are influenced by Scorpio and
Mars, and are consequently ferocious and pugnacious in the highest
degree; eaters of human flesh, utterly indifferent to danger, and so
regardless and prodigal of blood, as to slay each other without
hesitation on the slightest cause. The people in Phazania, Nasamonitis,
and Garamantica, are connected with Pisces and Jupiter, and are
accordingly frank and simple in manners, fond of employment, well
disposed, fond of the decencies of life, and, for the most part, free
and unrestrained in their actions: they worship Jupiter by the name of
Ammon.

The other parts of this quadrant, which lies near the middle of the
entire earth, are Cyrenaica, Marmarica, Ægypt, Thebais, Oasis,
Troglodytica, Arabia, Azania, and Middle Æthiopia. These countries,
being situated in the north-east of their quadrant, have due familiarity
with the north-east triplicity (consisting of Gemini, Libra, and
Aquarius), and are governed by Saturn and Jupiter, and also by Mercury.
Their inhabitants, therefore, participate in the influence of all the
five planets in vespertine figuration, and consequently cherish due love
and reverence for the gods, and dedicate themselves to their service.
They are addicted to sepulchral ceremonies; and, owing to the said
vespertine position, they bury their dead in the earth, <span
id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_90.md) and remove them from the

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

public eye. They use various laws and customs, and worship divers gods.
In a state of subjection, they are submissive, cowardly, abject, and
most patient; but when they command, they are brave, generous, and
high-minded. Polygamy is frequent among them, and practised by the women
as well as the men: they are most licentious in sexual intercourse, and
allow incestuous commerce between brothers and sisters. Both men and
women are extraordinarily prolific, and correspond in this respect with
the fecundity of their soil. Many of the men are, however, effeminate
and debased in mind; in consequence of the figuration of the malefics,
together with the vespertine position of Venus; and some of them
mutilate their persons. <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91.md)

Among these last named countries, Cyrenaica, Marmarica, and particularly
Lower Ægypt, are chiefly influenced by Gemini and Mercury: the natives
are therefore highly intellectual and sensible, and gifted with capacity
for every undertaking; above all, for the attainment of wisdom, and an
insight into divine mysteries. They are also magicians, performing
secret rites and ceremonies, and are in every respect calculated for the
prosecution of all scientific inquiry. <span
id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_92.md) The inhabitants of Thebais, Oasis, and
Troglodytica, are connected with Libra and Venus; they are of warmer
constitution, and more hasty disposition, and enjoy life in all its
plentitude and abundance. The natives of Arabia, Azania, and Middle
Ethiopia, have familiarity with Aquarius and Saturn; they consequently
feed on flesh and fish indiscriminately,

and live in a state of dispersion like wild beasts; they never unite in
society, but lead a wandering and savage life.

The familiarities exercised by the Planets, and by the Signs of the
Zodiac, together with the manners, customs, and qualities, particular as
well as general, which they produce, have now been concisely described;
but in order to facilitate the knowledge and use of them, the subjoined
table is inserted, to show, at one view, what countries are in
connection with each sign, respectively, according to the mode above
detailed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_80"></span>[44:1](ptb33.htm#fr_80.md) Or, perhaps, Bastarnia,
a part of the ancient European Sarmatia.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[44:2](ptb33.htm#fr_81.md) This should probably be
understood to mean in a mundane point of view, agreeably to Chaps. VI
and XV, Book I. For when Aries is on the ascendant, it is, of course,
oriental and masculine; and Sagittarius must consequently then be in the
eighth house, occidental, and therefore feminine.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[44:3](ptb33.htm#fr_82.md) The customs of nations
have, in some degree, altered since Ptolemy made this severe charge
against us and our brethren in the north and west of Europe. The
following passage also occurs in this part of the original text:--προσ
δε τασ συνουσιας των αψενικων ανακινουμενοι και ζηλουντες, και μητε
αισχρον μητε αναδρον τουτο νομιζοντες. δια τουτο ουδε εκλυονται, οτι
ουδε ως πασχοντες διακεινται επι τουτω, αλλα φυλαττουσι τασ ψυχας
ανδρειους·

<span id="fn_83"></span>[46:1](ptb33.htm#fr_83.md) The Greek is as follows:
καί τα μορια αυτων τα γεννητικα ατνατιθεασι τοις θεοις· διοτι ο
σχηματισμος των ειρημενων ασερων φυσει σπερματικος εσιν· Follies,
similar in their kind to these, are still practised by the Faquirs of
Hindostan, and by other religious sects in Asia.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[46:2](ptb33.htm#fr_84.md) Φανερως ποιουμενοι τας
προς τας γυναικας φυνουσιας· 

<span id="fn_85"></span>[46:3](ptb33.htm#fr_85.md) The author gives a
singular reason for this incest: μισουσι δε τας (συνουσιας) προς τους
αρσενας δια τουτο και οι πλεισοι αυτων εκ των μητερων τεκνοποιουσι· 

<span id="fn_86"></span>[46:4](ptb33.htm#fr_86.md) The epithet is
remarkable, not only as being, in the opinion of a Gentile, merited by
the Jews, among other nations, but also at a period scarcely exceeding a
century after their most heinous crime had been committed, expressly
under <span id="page_47">p. 47</span> the cloak of religion. It seems,
however, that the Jews were charged with atheism by other writers also,
and on account of their neglect of the false gods of the heathens; viz.
"*falsorium deorum neglectus*: quam candem causam etiam Judæis
maledicendi Tacitus habuit, et Plinius Major, cui Judæi dicuntur *gens
contumeliâ numinum insignis*." See Clark's Notes on Grotius de Verit.
Relig. Christ. Lib. 2, §2.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[47:1](ptb33.htm#fr_87.md) Other editions say
"Saturn."

<span id="fn_88"></span>[48:1](ptb33.htm#fr_88.md) It is usually understood
that the male deity, coupled by the Phrygians with Cybele, "the mother
of the Gods," was called by them Atys; and that Adonis was the name used
by the Phœnicians in addressing the associate of Venus. It has been said
that these divinities were identical with the Isis and Osiris of the
Ægyptians.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[48:2](ptb33.htm#fr_89.md) The name of Africa was,
in Ptolemy's time, limited to those parts of the coast on the
Mediterranean which contained the ancient Utica, and in which Tunis now
stands. Josephus says the name is derived from Afer (one of the <span
id="page_49">p. 49</span> posterity of Abraham by Cethurah), who is
stated to have led an army into Libya, and to have established himself
in the country. This Afer is, of course, the same with Epher, mentioned
in the fourth verse of the 25th chapter of Genesis, as a son of Midian,
one of the sons of Abraham by his concubine Keturah.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[49:1](ptb33.htm#fr_90.md) It does not appear why
this practice should have been remarked as a national peculiarity,
unless in distinction from the custom of burning the dead <span
id="page_50">p. 50</span> among the Greeks and Romans. Interment is
recorded as having been usual among the Jews, and it is known to have
been common among many ancient barbarous nations.

A conjecture may perhaps be allowed, that the author, when he wrote this
passage, had in his mind the magnificent subterranean palaces,
constructed for the dead, in parts of the region in question; some of
which have been recently made known to the modern world by the sagacity
and enterprise of the celebrated Belzoni.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[50:1](ptb33.htm#fr_91.md) Τινες δε και
καταφρονουσι των γεννητικων μελων.--The "contempt" here expressed by
καταφρονουσι has been taken by all translators (except Whalley) to
signify "mutilation."

<span id="fn_92"></span>[50:2](ptb33.htm#fr_92.md) History warrants the
high [encomium](errata.htm#5.md) here given to the natives of these
countries. Ægypt was the acknowledged mother of the arts and sciences,
and at one time the great depot of all the learning of the world: her
school of astronomy (a science which our author may be supposed to have
placed in the first rank), founded at Alexandria by Ptol. Philadelphus,
maintained its superior reputation for a thousand years. Cyrenaica gave
birth to many illustrious philosophers, and, among them, to
Eratosthenes, who is said to have invented the armillary sphere. This
great man measured the obliquity of the ecliptic, and, though he
erroneously reckoned it at only 20½ degrees, it should be recollected
that he lived 200 years before the Christian æra. He also measured a
degree of the meridian, and determined the extent of the earth, by means
similar to those adopted by the moderns.
