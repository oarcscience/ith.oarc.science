### CHAPTER V

### MARRIAGE

THE consideration of circumstances relating to marriage, or the
cohabitation of husband and wife, as sanctioned by law, succeeds to the
foregoing details, and must be pursued in the following method.

With regard to men, it is to be observed in what manner the Moon may be
disposed; for, in the first place, if she be found in the oriental
quadrants, she will cause men either to marry early in life, or, after
having over-passed their prime, to marry young women; "but, should she
be situated in either of the occidental quadrants, men will then marry
either late in life, or to women advanced in age <span
id="fr_240"></span>[1](#fn_240.md)": and if she be found under the Sun's
beams, and configurated with Saturn, she then entirely denies marriage.
Secondly, should she be in a sign of single form, and in application to
only one of the planets, she will cause men to marry only once; but, if
she be in a bicorporeal or multiform sign, or in application to several
planets, she will cause them to be married several times; and, provided
also that the planets, which thus, either by adjacency or by
testimony, <span id="fr_241"></span>[2](#fn_241.md) receive her
application, be benefic, men will then obtain good wives; but if, on the
contrary, the said planets be malefic, bad. For example, if Saturn
receive the Moon's application, the wives whom he will provide will be
troublesome and morose; but, if Jupiter receive it, they will be
decorous and economical; if Mars, bold and refractory; if Venus,
cheerful, handsome, and agreeable; and, if Mercury, sensible, prudent,
and clever. Moreover, should Venus be found connected with Jupiter,
Saturn, <span id="fr_242"></span>[3](#fn_242.md) or Mercury, she will
render wives provident, and attached to their husbands and children;
but, if she be found connected with Mars, they will be irascible,
unsteady, and indiscreet. Thus far in reference to the marriage of men.

But, in the case of women, the Sun must be observed, instead of the
Moon: and, should he be posited in the oriental quadrants, women will be
married either in their own youth, or to men younger than

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

themselves; but, if he be in the occidental quadrants, they will either
be married late in life, or to men who have passed their prime, and are
advanced in years. And should the Sun be in a sign of single form, or
configurated with only one oriental planet, he will cause them to enter
into matrimony only once; but, if in a bicorporeal or multiform sign, or
configurated with several oriental planets, he will then cause them to
be often married. And Saturn, being configurated with the Sun, will
provide husbands steadfast, advantageous, and industrious; Jupiter, such
as are honourable and noble-minded; Mars, severe husbands void of
affection and intractable; Venus, amiable and handsome husbands; and
Mercury, such as are provident and expert in business. But, if Venus be
found connected with Saturn, she will indicate dull and timid husbands;
"if with Jupiter, the husbands will be good, just, and modest <span
id="fr_243"></span>[1](#fn_243.md); "if with Mars, hasty, lustful, and
adulterous; and if with Mercury, they will be extravagantly desirous of
young persons. <span id="fr_244"></span>[2](#fn_244.md)

In regard to the Sun, those quadrants which precede the ascending and
descending points of the zodiac, and, in respect of the Moon, those
which are measured from her conjunction and opposition <span
id="fr_245"></span>[3](#fn_245.md) to her intermediate quarters, are called
oriental quadrants: the occidental quadrants are, of course, those lying
opposite to the oriental.

Whenever both nativities, viz. that of the husband and that of the wife,
may exhibit the luminaries configurated together in concord, that is to
say, either in trine or in sextile to each other, the cohabitation will
most usually be lasting; especially if the said concord exist by means
of interchange <span id="fr_246"></span>[4](#fn_246.md); but its duration
will be also much more securely established, provided the Moon in the
husband's nativity should correspond or agree with the Sun in the wife's
nativity. <span id="fr_247"></span>[5](#fn_247.md) If, however, the
relative positions of the luminaries be in signs inconjunct, or in
opposition, or in quartile, the cohabitation will be speedily dissolved
upon slight causes, and the total separation of the parties will ensue.

And should the configuration of the luminaries, when made in con-cord,
be aspected by the benefics, the cohabitation will continue in
respectability, comfort, and advantage; but, on the other hand, it will
abound in strife, contention, and misfortune, if the malefics be in
aspect to the said configuration.

In like manner, even though the luminaries may not be favourably

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

configurated in concord, should the benefits still offer testimony to
them, the cohabitation will then not be entirely broken off, nor totally
destroyed for ever, but will be again renewed, and re-established as
before. But if, on the contrary, the malefics bear testimony to such
discordant disposition of the luminaries, a dissolution of the
cohabitation will take place, accompanied by scorn and injury. Should
Mercury alone be conjoined with the malefics, it will be effected by
means of some public inculpation; and if Venus also be found with them,
it will be on the ground of adultery, or sorcery, or some similar
offence.

There are, however, other varieties in the married state, which are to
be contemplated by means of Venus, Mars, and Saturn. And should these
planets act in familiarity with the luminaries, the cohabitation will be
appropriate and domestic, and authorised by law; because Venus holds a
certain affinity both to Mars and Saturn: her affinity to Mars, for
instance, consists in each having exaltation in a sign belonging to the
other's triplicity, <span id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_248.md) and it
operates in the cases of youthful and vigorous persons: while her
affinity to Saturn arises from their respective houses being in the
signs, again also, belonging to each other's triplicity, <span
id="fr_249"></span>[2](#fn_249.md) and relates to persons of more advanced
age.

Hence, if Venus be in concurrence with Mars, she will produce entire
love and affection in the cohabiting parties; and if Mercury also
coincide with the said planets, such affection will become publicly
notorious. Should Venus be found in a sign mutually common and familiar,
such as Capricorn, or Pisces, <span id="fr_250"></span>[3](#fn_250.md) she
will effect marriages between brothers and sisters and kindred by blood:
and, provided she be also in the presence of the Moon, when the native
may be male, she will cause him to connect himself with two sisters, or
other near relatives; but, if the native be a female, a similar contract
on her part, with two brothers or near relatives, will be indicated,
when Venus may be also with Jupiter. <span
id="fr_251"></span>[4](#fn_251.md)

Again, if Venus be with Saturn, the cohabitation will be established
entirely in happiness and constancy; and if Mercury be present with
them, it will be profitable; but, should Mars be present, it will be
unsettled, calamitous, and afflicted by jealousy. And if Mars be
configurated on equal terms with Venus, Saturn, and Mercury, he will
effect marriage between persons of equal age; but, on the other hand,
should he be more oriental, marriage will take place with a younger man
or woman; and, if more occidental, with an older person. Should Venus
and Saturn be found in signs common to each other, that is to

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

say, in Capricorn and Libra, <span id="fr_252"></span>[1](#fn_252.md)
marriage will be contracted between persons kindred by blood: and, when
the said position may happen in the ascendant, or in the mid-heaven,
provided the Moon also should present herself there, men will become
connected with their mothers, or maternal aunts, or with their
mothers-in-law; and women with their own sons, or the sons of their
brothers, or with their daughters' husbands. But if, instead of the
Moon, the Sun should be in concurrence with the said position, and
especially should it happen that the planets in question may be
occidental, men will then connect [themselves](errata.htm#15.md) with their
daughters, or the wives of their sons; and women with their fathers, or
paternal uncles, or the husbands of their daughters.

When the aforesaid configurations, <span id="fr_253"></span>[2](#fn_253.md)
although not existing in signs of affinity to each other, <span
id="fr_254"></span>[3](#fn_254.md) should be found in feminine places, they
will render the parties obscene, lustful and shameless; for instance,
when found in the anterior and hinder parts of Aries, and near the
Hyades of Taurus, about the urn of Aquarius, in the hinder parts of Leo,
and in the face of Capricorn. And should the last-named planets, Venus
and Saturn, be posited in angles, they will then, if posited in the
first two angles, the eastern and southern, produce a total exposure of
the passions, and cause them to be publicly canvassed; but, if in the
last two angles, the western and northern, they will produce eunuchs, or
persons unprolific, and not possessing the proper channels of nature.

The passions, liable to operate in males, are to be considered by
observation of Mars: for should he be separated from Venus and Saturn,
but yet, at the same time, be supported by the testimony of Jupiter, he
will make men pure and decorous in sexual intercourse, and incline them
to natural usages only: and, if he attach himself to Saturn only, he
will render them cold in blood and dull in appetite; if, however, when
Saturn and Mars may be thus connected together, Venus and Jupiter should
also be configurated with them, men will then become easily excited and
eager in desire, although they will still be continent, and restrain
themselves in order to avoid reproach. But should Saturn be absent, and
Mars be with Venus alone, or even although Jupiter also be with her, men
will become highly licentious, and attempt to gratify their desires in
every mode. <span id="fr_255"></span>[4](#fn_255.md) And further, if Venus
be found

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

more occidental, men will connect themselves with low women, female
servants, and aliens or vagabonds; but, should Mars be found occidental,
with women of rank, and gentlewomen; or with women living with their
husbands, or under the protection of men. Thus far with regard to males.

In the case of females, Venus requires attention: for, if she be
configurated with Jupiter, or with Mercury, she will cause women to be
temperate and pure in sexual intercourse; still, however, when she may
be thus connected with Mercury, if Saturn be not present also, she will
cause them to be easily excited to desire; although they will control
their desires, and avoid reproach. But, should Venus be conjoined or
configurated with Mars alone, she will render women licentious and
lustful; and if, to both these planets, when thus conjoined or
configurated, Jupiter also present himself, Mars being at the same time
under the rays of the Sun, women will then mingle in intercourse with
servants, and persons meaner than themselves, or with aliens, or
vagabonds: but, should it happen that Venus may be under the rays of the
Sun, they will then connect themselves with their superiors or masters.
And, further, should the planets be in feminine places, or configurated
femininely, they will be content with their passive faculties only <span
id="fr_256"></span>[1](#fn_256.md).

Saturn, in being conciliated with such positions as those now described,
tends to produce greater obscenity; Jupiter, greater decency; and
Mercury, greater publicity, and greater fickleness, or instability.
