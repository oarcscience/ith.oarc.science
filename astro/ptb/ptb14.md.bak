### CHAPTER XI

### CONSTELLATIONS SOUTH OF THE ZODIAC

THE influences of the constellations south of the zodiac, existing in a
similar mode, are as follows:--

*Piscis Australis*. The bright star in the mouth is of the same
influence as Venus and Mercury.

*Cetus* is like Saturn.

*Orion*. The stars on the shoulders operate similarly to Mars and
Mercury; and the other bright stars to Jupiter and Saturn.

*Fluvius* (or *Eridanus*). The last bright one is of the same influence
as Jupiter; the rest are like Saturn.

*Lepus* is like Saturn and Mercury.

*Canis*. The bright star in the mouth is like Jupiter, and partly like
Mars: the others are like Venus.

*Procyon*. <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md) The bright star is like
Mercury, and in some degree like Mars.

*Hydrus*. The bright stars are like Saturn and Venus.

*Crater* is like Venus, and in some degree like Mercury.

*Corvus* is like Mars and Saturn.

*Argo*. The bright stars are like Saturn and Jupiter.

*Centaurus*. The stars in the human part of the figure are of the same
influence as Venus and Mercury; the bright stars in the horse's part are
like Venus and Jupiter.

*Lupus*. The bright stars are like Saturn, and partly like Mars.

*Ara* is like Venus, and also Mercury in some degree.

*Corona Australis*. The bright stars are like Saturn and Jupiter.

The respective influences of the several stars have been observed by the
ancients to operate in conformity with the mode pointed out in the
foregoing distributions. <span id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_51.md)

<span id="fn_51"></span>[20:2](ptb14.htm#fr_51.md) "Of the fixed stars in
general," Whalley says, "Those of the greatest magnitude are the most
efficacious; and those in, or near, the ecliptic, more powerful than
those more remote from it. Those with north latitude and declination
affect us most. Those in the zenith, influence more than others, more
remote. Likewise such as are in partial conjunction with, or in the
antiscions of any planets, or which rise and set, or culminate with any
planet, or are beheld by any planet, have an increase of power: but of
themselves the fixed stars emit no rays."
