### CHAPTER XIII

### MODE OF CONSIDERATION FOR PARTICULAR CONSTITUTIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE

THE first part of the consideration, requisite to form an estimate of
the various constitutions liable to take effect in the atmosphere,
applies to the general qualities pervading the several quarters of the
year, and has therefore the most extended scope. In order to learn these
qualities, it is necessary, in every quarter, to observe, as above
directed, the new or full Moon which may happen before <span
id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114.md) the period of the Sun's transit through

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

either tropical or equinoctial point, whichever it may be; and to
arrange the angles (as in the case of a nativity) according to the
degree and hour at which the new or full Moon may be found to happen, in
every latitude for which the consideration may be desired. Such planets
and stars as may have dominion over the places where the said new or
full Moon happens, and over the following angle, are then to be noted,
in the same manner as that stated with regard to eclipses. And after
these preliminary steps have been attended to, a general inference may
be drawn as to the proper qualities of the whole quarter; and the
intensity or relaxation of their operation is to be contemplated from
the natures of the ruling planets and stars, distinguished by the
faculties they possess, and by the mode in which they affect the
atmosphere.

The second part of the consideration relates to each month, and requires
a similar observation of the new or full Moon first taking place on the
Sun's progress through each sign: and it must be remembered, that, if a
new Moon should have happened at a period nearest to the Sun's transit
over the past tropical or equinoctial point, the new Moon also in each
succeeding sign, until the commencement of the next quarter, are to be
observed; but, if a full Moon should have so happened, then similar
observation is to be made of each subsequent full Moon. The angles,
also, must be duly attended to, as well as the planets and stars ruling
in both the places <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115.md); and especially
the nearest phases, applications, and separations of the planets, and
their properties. The peculiar qualities of the two places, and the
winds, liable to be excited by the planets themselves and by those parts
of the signs in which they may be situated, are likewise to be
considered; and also that particular wind, which is indicated by the
direction of the Moon's ecliptical latitude. By the aid of these
observations, and by weighing and comparing the existing vigour of each
of the several properties and qualities, the general constitution of the
atmosphere during each month may be predicted.

The third part of this consideration appertains to significations
applying more minutely, and points out their force or weakness. In

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

this case, the partile configurations of the Sun and Moon, at the
intermediate quarters, as well as at the new or full Moon, are to be
attentively regarded; since there is a certain variation in the
constitution of the atmosphere, which usually commences about three days
before, and sometimes, also, about three days after the Moon has equated
her course to the Sun. The configurations effected between the Moon, at
each quarterly equation, and the planets, whether by the trine, sextile,
or other authorized distances, are also to be observed; because the
peculiar property of the change in the constitutions of the atmosphere
depends much upon such configurations, and may be accordingly perceived
by considering the nature of the influence which the said configurated
planets and the signs exercise over the atmosphere and the winds.

The particular quality of the weather, thus produced, will be more fully
established on certain days; especially when the brighter and more
efficacious fixed stars may be near the Sun, either matutine or
vespertine; as, when so posited, they most frequently convert the
constitution of the atmosphere to an agreement with their own natures:
and, when the Luminaries may transit any one of the angles, a similar
effect is also produced. At all such positions the particular
constitutions of the atmosphere are subject to variation, and thus
become alternately more intense or more relaxed in their respective
qualities. In this manner, by certain positions of the Moon, the flux
and reflux of the sea are caused: and, when the Luminaries may be in
angles, a change of the wind is produced, according to the direction of
the Moon's ecliptical latitude.

Finally, in all these considerations, it must be remembered that the
more general and first constituted cause takes precedence, and that the
particular cause comes subsequently and secondarily: and, that the
operation is in the highest degree confirmed and strengthened, when the
stars, which regulate the general effects, may be also configurated
towards the production of the particular effects.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_114"></span>[66:1](ptb43.htm#fr_114.md) "*Before*." Although I
have thus Englished the word, προ, I think it properly requires to
[be](errata.htm#8.md) here rendered, by "*at*" or "*near to*," rather than
"*before*." Firstly, because my author (in speaking of the commencement
of each quarter of the year, in the 11th Chapter, [p.
93](ptb58.htm#page_93).md), has expressly stated that "the spring is to be
dated from the new or full Moon taking place when the Sun is *nearest*
(εγγισα) to the first point of Aries; the summer from that, when he is
nearest the first point of Cancer," &c., &c.; and (in [p.
94](ptb58.htm#page_94).md) he states that certain general effects are
brought about by the new or full Moon occurring *at* (κατα) the
aforesaid points." Secondly, because, in a few lines further on, in
speaking of the monthly consideration, p. 98, he again uses only εγγισα,
in reference to the present passage, in which, however, he has used only
προ. Thirdly, it is a proper inference that he meant to point out here
the new or full Moon which may happen *nearest* to the tropical or
equinoctial points, because he has previously and explicitly taught that
the principal variation of all things depends upon those points. Lastly,
Allatius has here rendered the word by no other than *proximé*, which is
also the word given in the Perugio Latin of 1646.

On the other hand, Whalley, in his note on the present chapter, says,
that "according to this Prince of Astrologers" (meaning Ptolemy), "we
are to observe the new or full Moon preceding the ingress, only, for our
judgment on the succeeding quarter, and not the lunation succeeding: and
the reason I conceive to be, because the lunation, which immediately
precedes the ingress, carries its influence to the very position of the
ingress itself, but not so that <span id="page_67">p. 67</span> which
follows the ingress." Wing, in his Introduction to the Ephemerides
(London, 1652) also says, that "for the knowledge of the weather, it is
requisite to observe the conjunction or opposition of the luminaries
next *preceding* the Sun's ingress into the first point of Aries."

Now, if a new or full Moon happen *immediately after* the Sun's transit
or ingress, the previous full or new Moon must have happened *a
fortnight before* the said transit or ingress; and, after considering
the other parts of Ptolemy's doctrine, I do not conceive, that he
intended to teach, in this chapter, that a *previous* lunation, when at
so great a distance before the important ingress, would have a greater
influence over the ensuing quarter of the year, than a *subsequent*
lunation taking place so closely after the said ingress.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[67:1](ptb43.htm#fr_115.md) "*Both the places*."
These are the places of the new or full Moon, and of the following
angle; as before mentioned with regard to the quarterly consideration.
