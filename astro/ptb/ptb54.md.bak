### CHAPTER X

### CHILDREN NOT REARED

THE question which now remains to be considered, in order to complete
the investigation of circumstances taking place simultaneously with the
nativity, or immediately consequent thereon, is, whether the child, then
born, will or will not be reared.

This inquiry is to be handled distinctly from that regarding the
duration of life, although there is an apparent connection between them.
The questions themselves are, indeed, similar; for it is much the same
thing to inquire whether the child will be nurtured, or how long it will
live; and the only distinction, between these two questions, arises from
the different modes in which they are treated. For instance, the inquiry
into the duration of life is to be pursued only in cases wherein there
is allotted to the native some space of time, not less in duration than
a solar period; that is to say, a year. Therefore, since time is also
measured by smaller portions, such as months, days, and hours, and since
the question, whether the native will or will not be reared, belongs to
cases wherein some exuberance of evil influence threatens speedy
destruction, and where life is not likely to endure throughout a whole
year, the inquiry into the duration of life must consequently involve a
more multifarious consideration, than that which relates to rearing;
which may be at once disposed of, in a more general and summary manner.

Thus, if either of the two luminaries be in an angle, and one of the
malefics be either in conjunction with that luminary, or else distant in
longitude from each luminary, in an exactly equal space; so as to form
the point of junction of two equal sides of a triangle, of which sides
the two luminaries form the extremities, while, at the same time, no
benefic star may partake in the configuration, and while the rulers of
the

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

luminaries may be also posited in places belonging to, or controlled by,
the malefics; the child, then born, will not be susceptible of nurture,
but will immediately perish.

Should the configuration, made between the malefic planet and the
luminaries, not exist precisely in the mode just mentioned; that is to
say, should the said planet not be equally distant from both luminaries,
so as to form the point of junction of two equal sides of a
[triangle](errata.htm#9.md); yet should it then happen that the rays of two
malefics may nearly approach the places of the two luminaries, casting
an injurious influence either on both, or only one of them, and if both
the said malefics be together succedent, or in opposition, to the
luminaries, or if one of them be succedent, and the other in opposition,
or even if only one may particularly afflict one of the luminaries,
then, in any such case, no duration of life will be allotted to the
child: for the supremacy of the power of the malefics extinguishes the
influence favourable to human nature, and tending to prolong existence.

Mars is exceedingly pernicious when succedent to the Sun, and Saturn
when succedent to the Moon. But a converse effect takes place when
either of these planets may be in opposition to the Sun or Moon, or in
elevation above them; for the Sun will then be afflicted by Saturn, and
the Moon by Mars; and especially so, provided the said planets should
have local prerogatives in the signs containing the luminaries, or in
the sign on the ascendant. And, should a double opposition exist, by the
circumstance of the luminaries being placed in two opposite angles, and
by the two malefics being each so posited as to be equally distant from
each luminary, the child will be born almost, if not quite, dead.
Nevertheless, if the luminaries should be separating from, or be
otherwise configurated with benefic planets, whose rays may be projected
to parts preceding the said luminaries, the child will then live as many
days, or hours, as there are degrees, numbered between the
prorogator <span id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_152.md) and the nearest
malefic.

If malefics should cast their rays to parts preceding the luminaries,
and benefics to parts following them, the child will be abandoned at its
birth; but will afterwards meet with adoption, and will live. Yet, if
the malefics should be in elevation above those benefics which are thus
configurated, the child, so adopted, will lead a life of misery and
servitude: if, on the contrary, the benefics should be in elevation,
then whoever may adopt the deserted child will supply the place of its
parents. And, provided a benefic planet should either ascend with, or
near in succession to the Moon, or be applying to her,

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

and one of the malefics be occidental, the child's own parents will, in
that case, take it again under their protection.

Rules similar to the foregoing are to be observed, when more than one
child is born; for, if any one of those planets, which may be
configurated towards the production of two, or even more children,
should be under the west, the children will be born half dead, or
deformed, and imperfect in body. And, if the planet so situated should
also be beneath the malefics, the children will not be susceptible of
nurture, or their life will be of the shortest span.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_152"></span>[87:1](ptb54.htm#fr_152.md) A prorogator is either
a luminary, planet, or a certain degree of the zodiac, which determines
the duration of life, or the time of the accomplishment of any event: it
is hereafter fully treated of in the 13th Chapter of this Book; which
shows that, in the instance now mentioned, it would be a luminary,
either in the ascendant, or in the mid-heaven.
