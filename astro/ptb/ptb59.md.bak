### CHAPTER XV

### EXEMPLIFICATION

IN order to exemplify the foregoing instructions, let the first point of
Aries be supposed as the preceding place, and the first point in Gemini
the succeeding; and let the latitude of the country, to which the
operation relates, be such as will cause the longest day to consist of
fourteen hours <span id="fr_175"></span>[2](#fn_175.md); and where the
horary magnitude of the beginning of Gemini will be about seventeen
equatorial times. <span id="fr_176"></span>[3](#fn_176.md)

Let the first point of Aries be first placed on the ascendant, so that
the beginning of Capricorn may be on the mid-heaven above the earth,

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

and the first point of Gemini be distant from the said mid-heaven 140
equatorial times. <span id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_177.md) Now, since the
first point of Aries is distant six temporal hours from the mid-heaven
above the earth, the times of that distance will be found, by
multiplying the said six hours by the seventeen equatorial times of the
horary magnitude of the first point of Gemini, to be 102. <span
id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_178.md) The whole sum of the distance to the
mid-heaven above the earth, is 148 times; and as 148 times exceed 102 by
46, the succeeding place will consequently devolve into the preceding
place after 46 times (being the amount of the times of ascension of
Aries and Taurus <span id="fr_179"></span>[3](#fn_179).md); since, in this
instance, the prorogatory place is established in the ascendant.

In like manner, let the first point of Aries be next placed on the
mid-heaven, culminating; so that the first point of Gemini, in its first
position, may be distant from the said mid-heaven 58 equatorial
times. <span id="fr_180"></span>[4](#fn_180.md) Now, as it is required to
bring the first point of Gemini, in its second position, to the
mid-heaven, the whole distance is to be reckoned, viz. 58 times, in
which Aries and Taurus pass the mid-heaven; because, again, the
prorogatory place was culminating. <span id="fr_181"></span>[5](#fn_181.md)

In the same way, let the first point of Aries be descending <span
id="fr_182"></span>[6](#fn_182.md); so that the beginning of Cancer may
occupy the mid-heaven, and the first point of Gemini precede the
mid-heaven at the distance of 32 equatorial times. <span
id="fr_183"></span>[7](#fn_183.md) Therefore, as the first point of Aries
is on the west, and again distant six temporal hours from the meridian,
let these six hours be multiplied by the seventeen times; which will
produce 102, making the sum of the distance <span
id="fr_184"></span>[8](#fn_184.md) of the first point of Gemini, at its
future descension, from the meridian. <span
id="fr_185"></span>[9](#fn_185.md) But, as the first point of Gemini, at
its first position, was already distant from the meridian 32 times which
number 102 exceed by 70; it will consequently arrive at its

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

descension after 70 times, the amount of the excess; in which space
Aries and Taurus will have descended, and their opposite signs Libra and
Scorpio arisen <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_186.md).

Again, let the first point of Aries have another position, not in any
angle, <span id="fr_187"></span>[2](#fn_187.md) but, for instance, at the
distance of three temporal hours past the meridian; so that the 18th
degree of Taurus may be on the mid-heaven, and the first point of Gemini
be approaching the mid-heaven, at the distance of thirteen equatorial
times. The seventeen times must, therefore, be again multiplied by the
three hours, and the first point of Gemini, at its second position, will
be found to be past the meridian, at the distance of 51 times. <span
id="fr_188"></span>[3](#fn_188.md) The distance of 13 times of the first
position and 51 times of the second position are then both to be taken;
and they will produce 64 times. In the former instances the prorogatory
place performed in the same succession; viz. occupying 46 times in
coming to the ascendant, 58 in coming to the mid-heaven, and 70 in
coming to the west; so that the present number of times, depending on
the intermediate position between the mid-heaven and the west, and being
64, also differs from each of the other numbers, in proportion to the
three hours' difference of position. For, in the other cases which
proceeded by quadrants, <span id="fr_189"></span>[4](#fn_189.md) according
to the angles, the times progressively differed by twelve, but, in the
present case of a minor distance of three hours, they differ by
six. <span id="fr_190"></span>[5](#fn_190.md)

There is, however, another method which may be used, and which is still
more simple; for instance, should the preceding degree be on the
ascendant, the following intermediate times of ascension, <span
id="fr_191"></span>[6](#fn_191.md) between it and the succeeding degree,
may be reckoned; should it be on the mid-heaven, the times of ascension
must be reckoned on a right sphere; and, if it be on the west,
descending, the intermediate times of descension <span
id="fr_192"></span>[7](#fn_192.md) are to be reckoned. But, should the
preceding degree be between any two of these angles, as, for instance,
at the distance of Aries, just spoken of, the proper times for each
angle must first be considered. And, since the first point of Aries was
assigned a position between the two angles of the mid-heaven and the
west, the proper times of the distances from

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

these angles to the first point of Gemini <span
id="fr_193"></span>[1](#fn_193.md) would be found to be 58 from the
mid-heaven, and 70 from the west. The distances, in temporal hours, of
the preceding degree from each of these angles, are then to be
ascertained; and whatever proportion these same temporal hours,
contained in such distances between the said preceding degree and each
angle, may bear to the temporal hours of the whole quadrant, the same
proportion, out of the excess of the times of distance of one angle over
those off the other, is either to be added to, or deducted from, the
actual number of times of the respective angles. For instance, in the
example before set forth, 70 times exceed 58 times by 12; and the
preceding place was distant from the angles three equal temporal hours,
which are the half of six, the number belonging to the whole quadrant.
Now, three being the half of six, and 12 being the amount of the excess,
the half of 12 is therefore to be taken, giving 6 to be either added to
the 58 times, or [subtracted](errata.htm#10.md) from the 70: thus, in
either way, [producing](errata.htm#11.md) 64, the required number of times.

If, however, the preceding place should be distant from either angle two
temporal hours, which are the third part of 6, then, in that case, the
third part of 12, the amount of the excess, must be taken, viz. 4: and,
if the said two hours be the distance, as calculated from the
mid-heaven, the said 4 times are to be added to the 58 times; but, if it
be the distance from the occidental angle, the 4 times are to be
subtracted from the 70.

In conformity with these rules now laid down, the amount of the times
must necessarily be obtained. <span id="fr_194"></span>[2](#fn_194.md)

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

The anæretic and critical influences of all meetings or descensions of
prorogators <span id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_195.md) remain to be
determined; beginning, in due order, with such as are accomplished in
the shortest time. And whatever else may happen, by means of any
affliction or assistance offered (in the manner heretofore prescribed)
during the actual transit of the meeting, is also to be decided on, as
well as whatever may occur through other circumstances, arising out of
the ingresses taking place at the time: because, should the places of
both the significators be afflicted, and should the transit of the
stars, at the then existing ingress, operate injuriously on the chief
ruling places, it is then altogether probable that death will
ensue; <span id="fr_196"></span>[2](#fn_196.md) and, even though one of the
places <span id="fr_197"></span>[3](#fn_197.md) may be disposed favour-ably
to human nature, the crisis will still be important and perilous; but,
if both the places be so disposed favourably, some debility only, or
transient malady, or hurt, will then happen. It is, however, necessary
in these cases, to consider also what familiarity, or analogy, the
peculiar properties of the places, thus meeting, may bear to the
circumstances of the nativity.

In order to obviate the doubts which frequently arise, as to the
particular star or place to which the anæretic dominion ought to be
assigned, all the meetings should be duly contemplated and considered,
each by each; and thus, after considering those chiefly corresponding
with the events already past, and with the future events about to
follow, or with the whole altogether, it will be practicable to found an
observation on the equality or inequality of their influence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_175"></span>[96:2](ptb59.htm#fr_175.md) This, in the Northern
Hemisphere, would be the latitude of Alexandria (where Ptolemy
flourished), or, in his own words, that of the 3rd Climate, passing
through Lower Egypt, numbered 30° 22'.--*Vide* extracts from the Tables
of the Almagest, inserted in the Appendix.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[96:3](ptb59.htm#fr_176.md) This is the magnitude
of the diurnal temporal hour of the first point of Gemini in the
latitude prescribed.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[97:1](ptb59.htm#fr_177.md) By right ascension, as
shown by the Extract, inserted in the Appendix, from the Tables of
Ascensions in the Almagest. The exact distance, however, according to
that Table, is 47° 44'.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[97:2](ptb59.htm#fr_178.md) Or rather, according
to the Table, 102° 39'.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[97:3](ptb59.htm#fr_179.md) That is to say, of the
oblique ascension, which is here required to be reckoned; because the
prorogatory and preceding place is in the ascendant. *Vide* [p.
95](ptb58.htm#page_95.md), and Note <sup>2</sup> in [p.
94](ptb58.htm#page_94.md). And the first point of Gemini, on arriving at
the ascendant, will be distant from the mid-heaven 102° 39' by right
ascension; the 13th degree of Aquarius being then in culmination in the
prescribed latitude. The oblique ascensions in the latitude 30° 22' N.
are also shown in the extract referred to in the preceding note: and it
thereby appears, that Aries and Taurus ascend in 45° 5', instead of 46°.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[97:4](ptb59.htm#fr_180.md) Or, rather, 57°
44'--by right ascension.--Vide extract above referred to.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[97:5](ptb59.htm#fr_181.md) *Vide* [p.
95](ptb58.htm#page_95.md).

<span id="fn_182"></span>[97:6](ptb59.htm#fr_182.md) Or on the cusp of the
7th House.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[97:7](ptb59.htm#fr_183.md) Or, rather, 32°
16'--by right ascension again.--*Vide* extract as before.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[97:8](ptb59.htm#fr_184.md) By right ascension.
The amount according to the Table is, however, 102° 39', as before
stated.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[97:9](ptb59.htm#fr_185.md) On which the 10th
degree of Virgo will then be posited.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[98:1](ptb59.htm#fr_186.md) By oblique descension
and ascension: *Vide* [p. 95](ptb58.htm#page_95.md).--The Table shows the
amount to be 70° 23'.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[98:2](ptb59.htm#fr_187.md) In reference to [p.
95](ptb58.htm#page_95.md), and Note <sup>1</sup> in the same page.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[98:3](ptb59.htm#fr_188.md) The 18th degree of
Cancer being then in culmination.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[98:4](ptb59.htm#fr_189.md) Or semi-diurnal arcs,
each equal to six temporal hours.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[98:5](ptb59.htm#fr_190.md) The amount of the
progressive difference of the times of prorogation, as here mentioned,
is of course only applicable to the parallel of declination of the first
point of Gemini, in the latitude before quoted. It must necessarily vary
in all other parallels of declination, and also in all other latitudes.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[98:6](ptb59.htm#fr_191.md) Oblique ascension.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[98:7](ptb59.htm#fr_192.md) The times of oblique
descension of any arc of the zodiac are equal to the times of oblique
ascension of its opposite arc; as before explained.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[99:1](ptb59.htm#fr_193.md) That is to say, at the
time of the 1st point of Aries transiting the cusp of each angle
respectively.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[99:2](ptb59.htm#fr_194.md) The calculation of
time may be greatly facilitated by the use of a zodiacal planisphere,
said to have been invented about thirty years ago by Mr. Ranger, who
died without making his invention public. The invention consists of a
set of instruments perfectly adapted, as far as relates to the zodiac,
for astronomical, as well as astrological, purposes; and the
completeness with which it solves, in the most intelligible and
expeditious manner, all the astronomical problems of the zodiac,
deserves attention. Whether a similar plansiphere was known in the days
of Placidus, I am not aware; but it is worthy of remark that the
following words occur in his "Primum Mobile," and seem almost to have
been predicted of Mr. Ranger's planisphere:--"If any one would provide
himself with a Ptolemic planisphere, with the horary circles,
crepuscules, the zodiac's latitude, and all other things requisite, it
would be of very great service towards foreseeing the aspects."
(Cooper's Translation, p. 87.) In the Appendix will be found a plate,
containing diagrams drawn by the instruments in question, which, though
not completely filled up, will show how easily, and, at the same time,
how accurately, the measure of time in directions may be ascertained.
The said diagrams have been adapted to the "exemplification" here given
by Ptolemy; one of them being laid down for the latitude of Alexandria,
and the other for the latitude of southern Britain (51° 30' N.), with
similar positions of the preceding and succeeding places adverted to in
the text.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[100:1](ptb59.htm#fr_195.md) These meetings and
descensions are technically termed "directions."

<span id="fn_196"></span>[100:2](ptb59.htm#fr_196.md) On these words
Placidus has the following remark: "The revolutions may possess some
virtue, but only according to the constitution of the stars to the
places of the prorogators of the nativity, and their places of
direction, but no farther; as Ptolemy was of opinion, and briefly
expresses himself in his Chapter of Life. 'Those who are afflicted, both
in the places and conclusions of the years, by the revolution of the
stars infecting the principal places, have reason to expect certain
death.'" (Cooper's Translation, p. 127.)

<span id="fn_197"></span>[100:3](ptb59.htm#fr_197.md) Of the significators
before mentioned.
