# APPENDIX

### NO. I

### ALMAGEST; BOOK VIII, CHAP. IV

THE various constellations of the fixed stars having now been duly
described, their aspects remain to be investigated.

Independently of the steadfast and immutable aspects which the said
stars preserve among themselves, either rectilinearly, or triangularly,
or by other similar forms, <span id="fr_294"></span>[1](#fn_294.md) they
have also certain aspects considered as referring exclusively to the
planets and the Sun and Moon, or parts of the zodiac; certain others to
the earth only; and others, again, to the earth, the planets and the Sun
and Moon, or parts of the zodiac, combined.

With regard to the planets only, and parts of the zodiac, aspects are
properly considered as made to them by the fixed stars, when the said
planets and fixed stars may be posited on one and the same of those
circles which are drawn through the poles of the zodiac; or, also, if
they be posited on different circles, provided a trinal or sextile
distance between them may be preserved; that is to say, a distance equal
to a right angle and a third part more, or a distance equal to
two-thirds of a right angle; and provided, also, that the fixed stars be
on such parts of the circle as are liable to be transited by any one of
the planets. These parts are situated within the latitude of the zodiac,
which circumscribes the planetary motions. And as far as the five
planets are concerned, the aspects of the fixed stars depend upon the
visible mutual conjunctions, or configurations, made in the forms above
prescribed; but, with respect to the Sun and Moon, they depend on
occultations, conjunctions, and succedent risings of the stars.
Occultation is when a star becomes invisible by being carried under the
rays of the luminary; conjunction, when it is placed under the
luminary's centre; and succedent rising, when it begins to reappear on
issuing out beyond the rays.

In regard to the earth only, the aspects of the fixed stars are four in
number, and are known by the common term of angles: to speak, however,
more particularly, they are the oriental horizon, the meridian or
mid-heaven above the earth, the occidental horizon, and the meridian or
mid-heaven below the earth. And in that part of the earth where the
equator is in the zenith, the whole of the fixed stars are found to

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

rise and set, and to be above as well as below the earth, once in each
revolution; because the situation of the poles of the equator, being in
this manner on the plane of the horizon, thereby prevents the constant
visibility or invisibility of any one of the parallel circles. But in
other parts of the earth, where the pole of the equator is in the
zenith, the fixed stars can never set nor rise; because the equator
itself is then on the plane of the horizon, and circumscribes the two
hemispheres (which it thus creates, one above and the other below the
earth) in such a manner, that in one revolution every star must twice
transit the meridian, some of them above, others below the earth. In
other declinations, however, between these extreme positions of the
equator, as just mentioned, there are certain of the circles always
visible, and others never visible; consequently, the stars intercepted
between the first of such circles and the poles can neither rise not
set, but must, in the course of one revolution, twice transit the
meridian; above the earth, if the said stars be on a circle always
visible; but below the earth, if on a circle never visible. The other
stars, however, situated on the greater parallels, both rise and set,
and are found in each revolution once on the meridian above the earth,
and once on that below the earth. In all these cases, the time occupied
in proceeding round from any angle to the same again, must be everywhere
equal in its duration, for it is marked by one sensible revolution; and
the time occupied in passing from either meridianal angle to the angle
diametrically opposite, is also everywhere equal; because it is marked
by the half of one revolution. So, also, the passage from either
horizontal angle to its opposite angle is again effected in the same
equal portion of time, wherever the equator may be in the zenith, for it
is then likewise marked by the half of an entire revolution; because on
such a position of the equator, all the parallels are then divided, as
well by the horizon as by the meridian, into two equal parts. But in all
other declinations, the time of passage of a semi-circle above the earth
is not equal to that of its passage below the earth, except only in the
case of the equinoctial circle itself, which, in an oblique sphere, is
the only one divided by the horizon into two equal parts, all others
(its parallels) being bisected into dissimilar and unequal arcs. It
follows, accordingly, that the time contained in the space between
rising or setting, and either meridian, must be equal to the time
between the *same* meridian and rising and setting; because the meridian
divides equally such portions of the parallels as are above or under the
earth. But in proceeding in an *oblique* sphere, from rising or setting
to *either* meridian, the time occupied must be unequal; and in a
*right* sphere, equal, because the entire portions above the earth are,
in a right sphere only, equal to those below the earth; whence, for
instance, in a right sphere, whatever stars may be together on the
meridian must also all rise and set together, until their progress
becomes perceptible by the poles of the zodiac; while, on the other
hand, in an oblique sphere, whatever stars may be together on the
meridian can neither all rise

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

together nor set together; for the more southern stars must always rise
later than those which are more northern, and set earlier. <span

The aspects made by the fixed stars, in regard to the planets or parts
of the zodiac, and the earth combined, are considered, in a general
manner, by the rising, or meridianal position, or setting of the same
fixed stars in conjunction with any planet or part of the zodiac; but
their aspects are properly distinguishable, by means of the Sun, in the
nine following modes:--

1\. The first is called matutine subsolar, when the star is found
together with the Sun in the oriental horizon. Of this aspect, one
species is called the oriental, invisible, and succedent rising; when
the star, at the commencement of its occultation, rises immediately
after the Sun: another is called the precise oriental co-rising; when
the star is found in partile conjunction with the Sun in the oriental
horizon: another is the oriental, precedent, and visible rising; when
the star, beginning to appear, rises before the Sun.

2\. The second aspect is termed matutine location in the mid-heaven;
when the star is found on the meridian, either above or below the earth,
while the Sun is on the oriental horizon. And of this aspect, one
species is called a succedent and oriental location in the mid-heaven,
invisible; when, immediately after the Sun's rising, the star shall be
found on the meridian: another is the precise oriental location in the
mid-heaven; when, exactly as the Sun rises, the star is at the same time
on the meridian; another is the oriental precedent location in the
mid-heaven; when the star first shall come to the meridian above the
earth, and the Sun may then immediately rise.

3\. The third, called matutine setting, is when the Sun may be actually
in the oriental horizon, but the star in the occidental. One of the
forms of this aspect is called the oriental, succedent setting,
invisible; when the star sets immediately after the Sun's rising:
another is the precise oriental co-setting, when the star sets at the
moment of the Sun's rising: another is the oriental, precedent, and
visible setting, when the Sun does not rise until immediately after the
setting of the star.

4\. The fourth aspect is named meridianal subsolar, and takes place when
the Sun is actually on the meridian, but the star on the oriental
horizon. Of this, one is diurnal and invisible; when the star rises
while the Sun is posited on the meridian above the earth: another is
nocturnal and visible; when the star rises while the Sun is placed on
the meridian below the earth.

5\. The fifth is called meridianal location in the mid-heaven; when the
Sun, as well as the star, may be at the same time on the meridian. Of
this aspect, two sorts are diurnal and invisible; when the star is on
the meridian above the earth, together with the Sun, or on that below

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

the earth, diametrically opposite to the Sun. Two also are nocturnal,
and of these, one is invisible; when the star is on the meridian under
the earth, together with the Sun: the other, however, is visible; when
the star is on the meridian above the earth, diametrically opposite to
the Sun.

6\. The sixth is meridianal setting; when the star is found on the
occidental horizon, while the Sun is on the meridian. Of this, one
species is diurnal and invisible; when the star sets while the Sun is
above the earth on the meridian: the other is nocturnal and visible;
when the star sets while the Sun is on the meridian below the earth.

7\. The seventh aspect is called vespertine subsolar; when the star is
found on the oriental horizon, while the Sun is posited on the
occidental horizon. One form of this aspect is the vespertine succedent
rising, visible; when the star rises immediately after sunset: another
is the precise vespertine co-rising; when the star rises and the Sun
sets at one and the same time: another is the precedent, vespertine
rising, invisible; when the star rises immediately before the Sun sets.

8\. The eighth is named vespertine location in the mid-heaven; when the
star is on the meridian, either above or below the earth, while the Sun
is placed on the occidental horizon. Of this aspect, one kind is called
a visible vespertine location in the mid-heaven; when the star is found
there immediately after sunset: another is the precise vespertine
location in the mid-heaven; when the star is found there at the moment
of sunset; another is the vespertine precedent location in the
mid-heaven, invisible; when the star arrives there immediately before
sunset.

9\. The ninth aspect is called vespertine setting; when the star,
together with the Sun, is on the occidental horizon. One form of this
aspect is the vespertine, succedent and visible setting; when the star,
at the commencement of its occultation, sets immediately after the Sun:
another is the precise vespertine setting; when the star sets at the
same moment with the Sun: another is the precedent, invisible setting;
when the star, before it emerges from its occultation, sets before the
Sun.
