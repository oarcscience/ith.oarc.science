### CHAPTER III

### THE DEGREE ASCENDING

THERE frequently arises some uncertainty as to the precise time of
birth, and some apprehensions lest it should not be accurately noted. In
most cases, the actual minute of the hour, at which the birth happens,
can only be ascertained by making a scientific observation, at the time,
with an horoscopical astrolabe <span id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_122.md);
for all other instruments, employed in ascertaining the hour, are almost
fallacious, although used by many persons with much care and attention.
The clepsydra, <span id="fr_123"></span>[2](#fn_123.md) for instance, is
subject to error, because the flow of the water will, from various
causes, proceed irregularly: and the sundial is often incorrectly
placed, and its gnomon often distorted from the true meridian line. To
obviate the difficulty arising from the inaccuracy of these instruments,
it seems highly necessary to present some method by which the actually
ascending degree of the zodiac may be easily ascertained, in a natural
and consistent manner.

And in order to attain this essential point, it is necessary first to
set down the ordinary degree which, by the Doctrine of Ascensions, <span
id="fr_124"></span>[3](#fn_124.md) is found near the ascendant at the
presumed hour. After this has been done, the new or full Moon, whichever
it may be, that may take place next before the time of parturition, must
be observed: and, if a new Moon, it will be necessary to mark exactly
the degree of the conjunction of the two luminaries; but, if a full
Moon, the degree of luminary only which may be above the earth during
the parturition. After this, it must be observed what planets have
dominion over the said degree: and their dominion depends always on the
five following prerogatives, viz. on triplicity, house, exaltation,
terms, and phase or configuration <span id="fr_125"></span>[4](#fn_125.md);

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

that is to say, a planet, eligible to dominion, must be connected with
the degree in question either by one, or more, or all of these
prerogatives.

If, therefore, there may be found any one planet properly qualified in
all or most of these prerogatives, the exact degree, which it occupies
in that sign in which it may be posited during the parturition, is to be
remarked; and it is then to be inferred that a degree of the same
numerical denomination was actually ascending, at the precise time of
birth, in that sign which appears, by the Doctrine of Ascensions, to be
nearest to the ascendant. <span id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_126.md)

But when two planets, or more, may be equally qualified in the manner
prescribed, it must be seen which of them may transit, during the
parturition, a degree nearest in number to the ordinary degree shown by
the Doctrine of Ascensions to be then ascending; and that said degree,
nearest in number, is to be considered as pointing out the numerical
denomination of the degree actually ascending. And when the degrees of
two planets, or more, may closely and equally approximate in numerical
denomination to the ordinary degree found by the Doctrine of Ascensions,
the degree of that planet which possesses further claims, by connection
with the angles and by its own condition, is to regulate the number of
the actually ascending degree.

It must however be observed, that if the actual distance of the degree,
in which the ruling planet may be posited, from the ordinary degree
ascending, be found to exceed its distance from the ordinary degree of
the mid-heaven; the numerical denomination, found in the way
above-mentioned, is then to be considered as applicable to the actual
degree in culmination; and the other angles are to be arranged in
conformity therewith. <span id="fr_127"></span>[2](#fn_127.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_122"></span>[74:1](ptb47.htm#fr_122.md) It is, perhaps,
needless to remark that modern improvements in science have superseded
the use of this and other ancient instruments here mentioned.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[74:2](ptb47.htm#fr_123.md) Although the
"clepsydra," or water-clock, was commonly used among the ancients for
various purposes, it appears, from Martian (a Latin writer, who lived
about A.D. 490), that there was also a clepsydra in special use as an
astrological engine.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[74:3](ptb47.htm#fr_124.md) "*The Doctrine of
Ascensions*," in allusion to the method of calculating the actual
position of the ecliptic.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[74:4](ptb47.htm#fr_125.md) "*Phase or
configuration*." Or, holding some authorized aspect to the degree in
question.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[75:1](ptb47.htm#fr_126.md) Or, on the ascendant.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[75:2](ptb47.htm#fr_127.md) The precepts delivered
in this Chapter have obtained the name of Ptolemy; Animodar: the term is
probably Arabic, if it be not a corruption of the Latin words *animum*,
or *animam*, *dare*, "giving animation or life "; yet this meaning seems
scarcely close enough.
