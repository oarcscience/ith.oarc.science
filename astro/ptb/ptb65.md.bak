### CHAPTER II

### THE FORTUNE OF WEALTH

THE circumstances regulating the fortune of wealth are to be judged of
from that part alone, which is expressly denominated the Part of
Fortune; the position of which is, in all cases, whether arising in the
day or in the night, always as far removed from the ascendant as the Sun
is distant from the Moon. <span id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_224.md)

When the Part of Fortune has been determined, it must be ascertained to
what planets the dominion of it belongs; and their power and connexion,
as also the power and connexion of others configurated with them, or in
elevation above them, whether of the same or of an adverse condition,
are then to be observed: for, if the planets which assume dominion of
the Part of Fortune be in full force, they will create much wealth, and
especially should the luminaries also give them suitable testimony in
addition.

In this manner, Saturn will effect the acquirement of wealth by means of
buildings, agriculture, or navigation; Jupiter, by holding some
government, or office of trust, or by the priesthood; Mars, by the army
and military command; Venus by means of friends, by the

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

dowry of wives, or by other gifts proceeding from women <span
id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_225.md); and Mercury by the sciences and by
trade.

Should Saturn, however, when thus in influence over the fortune of
wealth, be also configurated with Jupiter, he particularly provides
wealth through inheritance; especially, if the configuration should
exist in the superior angles, Jupiter being also in a bicorporeal sign
and receiving the application of the Moon; for, in such a case, the
native will also be adopted by persons unallied to him, and will become
heir to their property.

And, further, if other stars, of the same condition as those which rule
the Part of Fortune, should likewise exhibit testimonies of dominion,
the wealth will be permanent: but, on the other hand, if stars of an
adverse condition should either be in elevation above the ruling places,
or ascend in succession to them, the wealth will not continue. The
general period of its duration is, however, to be calculated by means of
the declination of the stars, which operate the loss, in respect of the
angles and succedent houses. <span id="fr_226"></span>[2](#fn_226.md)

<span id="fn_224"></span>[117:2](ptb65.htm#fr_224.md) *Vide* Chapter XIII
of the 3rd Book.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[118:1](ptb65.htm#fr_225.md) I have considered the
words, γυναικειων δωρεων, as comprising "the dowry of wives," as well as
other "gifts from women."

<span id="fn_226"></span>[118:2](ptb65.htm#fr_226.md) That is to say, its
duration will depend on the time requisite to complete the arc of
direction or prorogation between the stars, operating the loss, and the
places which give the wealth. And the calculation is to be made as
pointed out in the 14th and 15th Chapters of the 3rd Book.
