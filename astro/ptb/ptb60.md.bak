### CHAPTER XVI

### THE FORM AND TEMPERAMENT OF THE BODY

THE matters affecting and regulating the duration of life have now been
disposed of; and it becomes proper to enter into further particulars,
commencing, in due order, with the figure and conformation of the body;
because Nature forms and moulds the body before she inspires it with a
soul. In fact, the body, in its materiality, is endowed with suitable
constitutional properties begotten with it, and almost apparent from its
very birth; but the soul afterwards, and by degrees, develops

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

the appropriate qualities which it derives from the primary cause, and
which become known much later than external attributes, and in process
of time only.

In regard to the body, therefore, it is in all cases requisite to
observe the oriental horizon, and to ascertain what planets may preside
or have dominion over it, and also to pay particular attention to the
Moon. For, from both these places, <span id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_198.md)
and from their rulers, as well as from the natural formation and
contemperament appertaining to every species of the human race, and also
from the figure ascribed to those fixed stars which may be co-ascending,
the conformation of the body is to be inferred. The planets possessing
dominion have the chief influence, and the proper qualities of their
places co-operate with them. And, in order to simplify these
instructions, and as the planets are first to be treated of, each planet
is individually to be considered as follows, viz.:

Saturn, when oriental, acts on the personal figure by producing a
yellowish complexion and a good constitution; with black and curled
hair, a broad and stout chest, eyes of ordinary quality, and a
proportionate size of body, the temperament of which is compounded
principally of moisture and cold. Should he be occidental, he makes the
personal figure black or dark, thin and small, with scanty hair on the
head; the body without hair, but well shaped; the eyes black or dark;
and the bodily temperament consisting chiefly of dryness and cold.

Jupiter ruling, when oriental, makes the person white or fair, with a
clear complexion, moderate growth of hair, and large eyes, and of good
and dignified stature; the temperament being chiefly of heat and
moisture. When occidental, he still causes a fair complexion, but not of
equal clearness; and he produces long straight hair, with baldness on
the forehead or on the crown of the head; and he then also gives a
middle stature to the body, with a temperament of more moisture.

Mars, ascending, gives a fair ruddiness to the person, with large size,
a healthy constitution, blue or grey eyes, a sturdy figure, and a
moderate growth of hair, with a temperament principally of heat and
dryness. When occidental, he makes the complexion simply ruddy, and the
personal figure of moderate stature, with small eyes; the body without
hair, and the hair of the head light or red, and straight; the bodily
temperament being chiefly dry.

Venus operates in a manner similar to that of Jupiter, but, at the same
time, more becomingly and more gracefully; producing qualities of a
nature more applicable to women and female beauty, such as softness,
juiciness, and greater delicacy. She also peculiarly makes the eyes
beautiful, and renders them of an azure tint.

Mercury, when oriental, makes the personal figure of a yellowish
complexion, and of stature proportionate and well-shaped, with small

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

eyes and a moderate growth of hair; and the bodily temperament is
chiefly hot. If occidental, he gives a complexion white or fair, but not
altogether clear; straight, dark hair, a thin and slight figure, some
squint or defect in the eyes, and a long visage <span
id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_199.md) faintly red; the temperament being
chiefly dry.

The Sun and Moon, when configurated with any one of the planets, also
co-operate: the Sun adds a greater nobleness to the figure, and
increases the healthiness of the constitution; and the Moon, especially
when holding or delaying her separation, <span
id="fr_200"></span>[2](#fn_200.md) generally contributes better proportion
and greater delicacy of figure, and greater moisture of temperament;
but, at the same time, her influence in this latter particular is
adapted to the proper ratio of her illumination; as referred to in the
modes of temperament mentioned in the beginning of this treatise. <span
id="fr_201"></span>[3](#fn_201.md)

Again, should the planets be matutine, and fully conspicuous, <span
id="fr_202"></span>[4](#fn_202.md) they will cause the body to be large; if
in their first station, they will make it strong and vigorous; if they
should precede or be in advance, it will be disproportionate; if in
their second station, it will be weaker, and, if vespertine, altogether
mean and subservient to evil treatment and oppression. At the same time,
the places of the planets, <span id="fr_203"></span>[5](#fn_203.md) as has
been already said, co-operate especially in producing the shape of the
personal figure, and contribute also towards the temperament.

And further, it is the general tendency of the quadrant comprised
between the vernal equinox and the summer tropic to produce good
complexions, advantageous stature, fine constitutions, and fine eyes;
with a temperament abounding in heat and moisture. The quadrant from the
summer tropic to the autumnal equinox tends to produce an ordinary
complexion, proportionate stature, a healthy constitution, large eyes, a
stout person, with curled hair, and a temperament abounding in heat and
dryness. The quadrant from the autumnal equinox to the winter tropic
causes yellowish complexions, slender, thin, and sickly persons, with a
moderate growth of hair, fine eyes, and a temperament abundantly dry and
cold. The other quadrant, from the winter tropic to the vernal equinox,
gives a dark complexion, proper stature, straight hair on the head and
none on the body, a goodly figure, and a temperament abounding in cold
and moisture.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

To speak, however, more particularly, all constellations of human form,
both those within and those without the zodiac, act in favour of giving
a handsome shape to the body, and due proportion to the figure; while
those not of human form vary its due proportions, and incline it towards
their own shape; assimilating it, in some measure, to their own
peculiarities, either by enlarging or diminishing its size, by giving it
additional strength or weakness, or by otherwise improving or
disfiguring it. Thus, for example, Leo, Virgo, and Sagittarius enlarge
the person; and Pisces, Cancer, and Capricorn tend to make it
diminutive; and thus, again, the upper and anterior parts of Aries,
Taurus, and Leo increase its strength and their lower and posterior
parts render it weaker: while, on the other hand, Sagittarius, Scorpio,
and Gemini act conversely; for their anterior parts produce greater
debility, and their posterior parts greater vigour. In like manner,
Virgo, Libra, and Sagittarius contribute to render the person handsome
and well-proportioned; and Scorpio, Pisces, and Taurus incline it to be
misshapen and disfigured.

The other constellations <span id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_204.md) also
operate on similar principles; and all these influences it is necessary
to bear in mind, in order that the peculiar properties, observed in
their joint temperament, may be so compounded as to authorize an
inference therefrom, concerning the form and temperament of the body.

ascendant, and that of the Moon.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[102:1](ptb60.htm#fr_199.md) The original word is
(in the accusative plural) αιγοηους, which Allatius has rendered, by
"*pedibus caprinis*," *goat-footed*, as if it were compounded of αιξ
*capra* and πους *pes*; but the preferable derivation seems to be from
αιξ and ωψ *vultus*; meaning "*goat-faced*."
