THE use recently made of Astrology in the poetical machinery of certain
works of genius (which are of the highest popularity, and above all
praise), seems to have excited in the world at large a desire to learn
something of the mysteries of that science which has, in all former
ages, if not in these days, more or less engaged reverence and usurped
belief. The apparent existence of such a general desire has caused the
completion of the following Translation, and its presentation to the
public; although it was originally undertaken only in part, and merely
to satisfy two or three individuals of the grounds on which the now
neglected doctrines of Astrology had so long and so fully maintained
credit.
