### CHAPTER XXI

### THE TRIPLICITIES

THE familiarity existing by triplicity arises in the following mode:

The triplicity preserves accordance with an equilateral triangle, and
the whole zodiacal orbit is defined by three circles, viz. that of the
equinox, and those of the two tropics; the twelve signs are, therefore,
distributed among four equilateral triangles.

The first triangle, or triplicity, is formed by three masculine signs,
Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius, having the Sun, Jupiter, and Mars as lords
by house. Mars, however, being contrary in condition to the solar
influence, this triplicity receives, as its lords, only Jupiter and the
Sun. By day, therefore, the Sun claims the principal co-regency of it,
and Jupiter by night. Aries is on the equinoctial circle, Leo on the
summer, and Sagittarius on the winter circle. This triplicity is
principally northern, owing to the concurrent dominion of Jupiter, who
is fruitful and airy, and expressly connected with winds proceeding from
the north; it is, however, also north-west, in consequence of being, in

some degree, combined with the west by means of the house of Mars, who
introduces western breezes and the feminine qualities of that quarter,
in consequence of his lunar condition <span
id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61.md).

The second triplicity, formed by Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn, is
allotted to the dominion of the Moon and Venus, since it consists of
feminine signs. The Moon rules it by night, and Venus by day. Taurus is
on the summer circle, Virgo on the equinoctial, and Capricorn on the
winter. This triplicity is southern, in consequence of the dominion of
Venus, whose warm and moist influence produces south winds: it, however,
additionally receives a mixture of the east, by means of Saturn; for, as
Capricorn is the house of that planet, and an eastern sign, Saturn
becomes effective of winds from that quarter, and furnishes this
triplicity with a mixture of the east, with which quarter he is further
connected by means of his solar condition. <span

The third triplicity is composed of Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius,
masculine signs. It holds connection with Saturn and Mercury by
containing their houses, and is therefore attributed to them, and not to
Mars, to which planet it bears no relation. Saturn rules it by day,
owing to his condition, <span id="fr_63"></span>[3](#fn_63.md) and Mercury
by night. Gemini is on the summer circle, Libra on the equinoctial, and
Aquarius on the winter. This triplicity is principally eastern, by the
influence of Saturn; but it becomes north-east by receiving also a
mixture of the north from the condition of Jupiter, with which planet
Saturn has, in this respect, a diurnal familiarity. <span

The fourth triplicity, formed by Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces, is left to
the remaining planet, Mars, who has right in it by means of his house,
Scorpio. But, as the signs which compose this triplicity are feminine,
the Moon by night and Venus by day, through their feminine condition,
govern it, together with Mars. Cancer is on the summer circle, Scorpio
on the winter, and Pisces on the equinoctial. This triplicity is
western, in consequence of the government of the Moon and Mars; but it
is also blended with the south by the joint dominion of Venus, and
therefore becomes south-west.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_61"></span>[30:1](ptb24.htm#fr_61.md) The "lunar condition"
here spoken of refers to the position of Aries (Mars's house) in the
lunar semicircle.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[30:2](ptb24.htm#fr_62.md) Capricorn being in the
solar semicircle.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[30:3](ptb24.htm#fr_63.md) The reason for making
Saturn diurnal lord of this triplicity may be found in Chap. vii.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[30:4](ptb24.htm#fr_64.md) This familiarity seems
to arise from the sextile aspect between Aquarius, the diurnal house of
Saturn, and Sagittarius, the diurnal house of Jupiter.
