### CHAPTER XII

### THE ANNUAL SEASONS

THE year comprises four seasons; spring, summer, autumn, and winter; of
these, the spring partakes chiefly of moisture, for on the dissipation
of cold and recommencement of warmth, an expansion of the fluids takes
place: the summer is principally hot, owing to the Sun's nearest
approach to the zenith: the autumn is principally dry, because the
recent heat has absorbed the moisture: and the winter is chiefly cold,
the Sun being then at his farthest distance from the zenith.

The beginning of the whole zodiacal circle (which in its nature as a
circle can have no other beginning, nor end, capable of being
determined), is therefore assumed to be the sign of Aries, which
commences at the vernal equinox: <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md)
since the moisture of spring forms a primary beginning in the zodiac,
analogous to the beginning of all animal life; which, in its first age
of existence, abounds principally in moisture: the spring, too, like the
first age of animal life, is soft and tender; it is therefore suitably
placed as the opening of the year, and is followed by the other seasons
in appropriate succession. The summer comes second, and, in its vigour
and heat, agrees with the second age of animals; the prime of life, and
the period most abounding in heat. Again, the age when the prime of life
has passed away, and in which decay prepares to advance, is chiefly
abundant in dryness, and corresponds to the autumn. And the final period
of old age, hastening to dissolution, is principally cold, like the
winter.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_52"></span>[21:1](ptb15.htm#fr_52.md) This sentence shows the
futility of the objection raised against astrology (and mentioned in the
Preface to this translation) that the signs have changed and are
changing places. It is clear from this sentence that Ptolemy ascribes to
the 30 degrees after the vernal equinox, that influence which he has
herein mentioned to belong to Aries; to the next 30 degrees, the
influence herein said to belong to Taurus; and so of the rest of the
zodiac. We should rather say that the stars have changed places, than
that the parts of heaven, in which they were once situated, have done
so. Ptolemy himself seems to have foreseen this groundless objection of
the moderns, and has written, in the 25th chapter of this book, what
ought completely to have prevented it. It has certainly been one of the
misfortunes of astrology to be attacked by people entirely ignorant of
its principles.
