</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAPTER XVII</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">SIGNS COMMANDING AND OBEYING</h3>  
<p>ANY two signs configurated with each other at an equal distance from the same, or from either equinoctial point, are termed commanding and obeying, because the ascensional and descensional times of the one are equal to those of the other, and both describe equal parallels.</p>  
<p>The signs in the summer semicircle are commanding; those in the winter semicircle, obeying: for, when the Sun is present in the former, he makes the day longer than the night; and, when in the latter, he produces the contrary effect.</p>
