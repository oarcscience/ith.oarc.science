### CHAPTER XII

### THE PARTICULAR NATURES OF THE SIGNS BY WHICH THE DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE ARE PRODUCED <span id="fr_112"></span>[3](#fn_112.md)

THE sign of Aries has a general tendency, arising from the presence of
the Equinox, to promote thunder and hail. Certain of its parts, however,
operate in a greater or less degree, according to the nature of the
stars

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

which compose the sign: for instance, the front parts excite rain and
wind; the middle are temperate; and those behind are heating and
pestilential. The northern parts, also, are heating and pernicious, but
the southern cooling and frosty.

The sign of Taurus, in its general character, partakes of both
temperaments, <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md) but is nevertheless
chiefly warm. Its front parts, and especially those near the Pleiades,
produce earthquakes, clouds and winds: the middle parts are moistening
and cooling; those behind, and near the Hyades, are fiery, and cause
meteors and lightnings. The northern parts are temperate; the southern
turbulent and variable.

Gemini, in its general tendency, is temperate; but its leading parts
produce mischief by moisture; its middle parts are entirely temperate;
its latter parts mixed and turbulent. The northern parts promote
earthquakes and wind; and the southern are dry and heating.

Cancer is, in the whole, serene and warm, but its anterior part near the
Præsepe are oppressively hot and suffocating; the middle parts are
temperate, and the latter parts excite wind. And both its northern and
southern parts are equally fiery and scorching.

Leo has a general tendency operative of stifling heat. The anterior
parts are oppressively and pestilentially hot; yet the middle parts are
temperate; and those behind are injurious by means of moisture. The
northern parts produce variation and heat, and the southern moisture.

Virgo, in its general tendency, excites moisture and thunder. The front
parts, however, are chiefly warm and noxious; the middle temperate; and
the latter parts watery. The northern parts promote wind; the southern
are temperate.

Libra has a general tendency to produce change and variation. Its front
and middle parts are temperate; its hinder parts watery. The northern
parts cause variable winds, and the southern are moistening and
pestilential.

Scorpio, in its general character, is fiery and productive of thunder.
The front parts cause snow; the middle are temperate; the latter parts
excite earthquakes. Its northern parts are heating; its southern,
moistening.

Sagittarius, generally, is effective of wind. The front parts are
moistening; the middle temperate; and the hinder parts fiery. The
northern parts promote wind, and the southern variation and moisture.

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

Capricorn's general tendency is to operate moisture. But its anterior
parts are pernicious by means of heat, its middle parts are temperate,
and its latter parts promote rain. Both its northern and southern parts
are injurious by means of moisture.

Aquarius, in its general character, is cold and watery. The front parts
are moistening; the middle temperate; and the latter parts productive of
wind. The northern parts are heating; the southern cause snow.

Pisces, in its general character, is cold and effective of wind. The
front parts are temperate; the middle moistening; the hinder parts
highly heating. The northern parts excite wind, and the southern are
watery.

new and full Moon taking place during the Sun's progress through each
sign.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[64:2](ptb41.htm#fr_111.md) The passage marked
thus " " is not in the Greek, but is found in two Latin translations.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[64:3](ptb42.htm#fr_112.md) According to Wing, in
his "Instructions to the Ephemerides," printed in 1652, the signs, as
mentioned in this chapter by Ptolemy, are to be considered <span
id="page_65">p. 65</span> in their quality as constellations, and not as
spaces of the heavens. This opinion, however, seems to me to be
erroneous; for Ptolemy has already devoted a chapter in the 1st Book to
the detail of the influences of the several stars in the respective
constellations of the zodiac; and he moreover speaks, in the present
chapter, of the operation of Aries, as owing to the presence of the
Equinox. This he could not have done, had he spoken of the signs as
constellations instead of spaces.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[65:1](ptb42.htm#fr_113.md) The temperaments here
alluded to are, probably, heat and cold.
