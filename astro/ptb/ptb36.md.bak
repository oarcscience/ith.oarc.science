### CHAPTER VI

### THE REGIONS OR COUNTRIES TO BE CONSIDERED AS LIABLE TO BE COMPREHENDED IN THE EVENT

THE first of the several branches of consideration just enumerated
relates to locality, and is to be exercised in the following manner:--

In all eclipses of the Sun and Moon, and especially in such as are fully
visible, the place in the zodiac, where the eclipse happens, is to be
noted; and it must be seen what countries are in familiarity with that
place, according to the rules laid down regarding the quadrants and the
triplicities; and in like manner it must be observed what cities are
under the influence of the sign in which the eclipse happens; either by
means of the ascendant, and the situations of the luminaries at the time
of their foundation, or by means of the mid-heaven of their kings or
governors, actually ruling at the time of the eclipse; although such
time may be subsequent to the building of the said cities. Whatever
countries or cities shall be thus found in familiarity with the
ecliptical place, will all be comprehended in the event; which will,
however, principally attach to all those parts which may be connected
with the identical sign of the eclipse, <span

the earth. <span id="fr_95"></span>[2](#fn_95.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_94"></span>[53:1](ptb36.htm#fr_94.md) As shown in the Table at
page [51](ptb33.htm#page_51.md).

<span id="fn_95"></span>[53:2](ptb36.htm#fr_95.md) It does not appear that
the text here warrants the conclusion which Whalley has drawn from it,
viz. "that wherever eclipses are not visible, they have no influence,
and therefore subterranean eclipses cannot have any." Ptolemy declares,
that *all* countries in familiarity with the ecliptical place will be
comprehended in the event; and, with regard to the visibility or
invisibility of the eclipse, he says merely that its effects will be
*principally* felt in such of the said countries as might have obtained
a view of the eclipse.
