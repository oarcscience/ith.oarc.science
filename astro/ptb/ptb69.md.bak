### CHAPTER VI

### CHILDREN

THE next point to be investigated is that concerning children: and, to
accomplish this, observation must be made of the planets posited in, or
configurated with the place on the zenith, <span
id="fr_257"></span>[2](#fn_257.md) or its succedent house, which latter is
called the place of the good dæmon. And should it happen that not any
planets may be present in the said places, nor configurated with them,
it will then be necessary to take into consideration such as may be in
opposition thereto.

Now the Moon, Jupiter, and Venus are esteemed as givers of off-spring;
but the Sun, Mars, and Saturn are considered as denying children
altogether, or as allowing but few: while Mercury, being in quality
common to both parties, lends co-operation to that with which he may be
configurated, and gives offspring, when oriental, but with-holds, when
occidental.

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

To speak briefly, if the planets, which grant progeny, be so posited as
described, <span id="fr_258"></span>[1](#fn_258.md) and placed singly, the
gift of progeny will be single only <span
id="fr_259"></span>[2](#fn_259.md); but should they be in bicorporeal or in
feminine signs, they will grant double offsprings <span
id="fr_260"></span>[3](#fn_260.md): so likewise if they should be in
prolific or seminal signs, such as Pisces, Cancer, and Scorpio, they
will grant twins, or even more. And provided they should also be
masculinely constituted, as well by configuration with the Sun, as by
being in masculine signs, they will grant male children; but otherwise,
if femininely constituted, female.

But, although the said planets, even if beneath the malefics in
elevation, or, even if found in barren places, or in signs such as those
of Leo and Virgo, will still grant children; yet such children, thus
indicated, will neither be healthy, nor continue in life. Should it
happen, however, that the Sun and the malefics may be in entire
possession of the places above mentioned, viz. that on the zenith, or
the succedent house allotted to the good dæmon; and provided they be, at
the same time, in masculine or barren signs, and the benefics be not in
elevation above them, a total privation of offspring is thereby
indicated; but, should they be in feminine or prolific signs, or
supported by the testimony of the benefics, children will then be
granted; yet they will be liable to disease, and short-lived.

If, however, planets of each condition should be configurated with, and
have prerogative in prolific signs, there will then ensue a loss of
either all the children, or only few, or else the major part of them; in
the same proportion as that in which the planets, bearing testimony to
either condition, may preponderate on one side rather than the other; by
excelling in number, or in influence, in consequence of being posited
more orientally, more genuinely in angles, higher in elevation, or
successively ascending.

When the lords of the aforesaid signs <span
id="fr_261"></span>[4](#fn_261.md) may be such as are givers of offspring,
and be either oriental, or in places proper to themselves, the children
thus granted will become eminent and illustrious: but, if occidental, or
in places not proper to themselves, the children will then become
undistinguished and abject. Should the said lords also be in concord
with the part of fortune, and with the ascendant, they will render the
children amiable, and cause them to be beloved by their parents, and to
inherit their parents' substance: but, if found inconjunct, and not in
concord with the said parts, the children will then become odious and
mischievous to their parents, and will forfeit the inheritance of their
substance.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

Further, should the planets which grant progeny be appropriately
configurated with each other, they will promote brotherly love, and
mutual regard and affection among the children; but, if in conjunct, or
in opposition, they will excite in them mutual hatred, deceit, and
treachery.

The general investigation regarding children is to be conducted in the
foregoing method: but, in order to enquire into particular circumstances
consequent on the above, it will be necessary to assume, as an
ascendant, the position of each planet which gives offspring, and to
observe the separate schemes; drawing inferences therefrom as in the
case of a nativity.

mid-heaven.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[129:1](ptb69.htm#fr_258.md) The meaning, apparent
from the commencement of the chapter, is this: "Should such planets be
in the mid-heaven or its succedent house, or configurated with either."
