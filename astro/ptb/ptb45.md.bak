# BOOK THE THIRD

### CHAPTER I

### PROEM

IN the preceding pages, such events as effect the world generally I have
been discussed in priority; because they are operated by certain
principal and paramount causes, .which are, at the same time,
predominant over particular and minor events applicable only to the
separate properties and natural peculiarities of individuals. The
foreknowledge of these particular events is called Genethlialogy, or the
science of Nativities.

It must be remembered that the causation, by which all effects, whether
general or particular, are produced and foreknown, is essentially one
and the same; for the motions of the planets, and of the Sun and Moon,
present the operative causation of events which happen to any
individual, as well as of those which happen generally; and the
foreknowledge of both may be obtained by the several creatures and
substances, subjected to the influence of the heavenly bodies, and by
due attention to the changes produced in those natures, by the
configurations displayed in the Ambient by the planetary motion.

Still, however, the causes of general events are greater and more
complete than those of particular events; and, although it has been now
stated, that one single identical power supplies both the causation and
the foreknowledge of general as well as particular events, yet there
does not belong to the two sorts of events a similar origin or
beginning, at which observation of the celestial configurations must be
made, for prognostication. In regard to general events, the dates of
origin and commencement are many and various; for all general events
cannot be traced to one origin, neither is their origin always
considered by means of the matter subjected to their operation, for it
may be also established by circumstances occurring in the Ambient and
presenting the causation. It may, in fact, almost be said that they all
originate in eminent eclipses of the Luminaries, and in remarkable
transits made by the stars, at various times.

Particular events, however, which concern men individually, may be
traced to one origin, single as well as manifold. Their origin is
single, in respect to the primary composition of the nascent man; but it
is also manifold, in respect to other circumstances subsequently
indicated by dispositions in the Ambient, correlative to the primary
origin. In all

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

particular events, the origin, or birth, of the subjected matter itself,
must, of course, be the primary origin; and, in succession thereto, the
various beginnings of other subsequent circumstances are to be assumed.
Hence, therefore, at the origin of the subjected matter, all the
proper-ties and peculiarities of its contemperament must be observed;
and then the subsequent events, which will happen at certain periods,
sooner or later, are to be considered by means of the division of time,
or the scale of the ensuing years. <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120.md)
