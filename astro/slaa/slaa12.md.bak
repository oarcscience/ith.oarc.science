### Chapter X

#### Solar Omens, Traditions, and Superstitions

THE past has bequeathed to us a wealth of lore, in the nature of omens
and wise saws, superstitions and quaint fancies, the product of
imaginative speculation in every phase of human existence, from the
earliest times. This is especially true of the influence exerted on
human affairs by the sun, moon, and stars; and though, as might be
expected, less superstition is attached to the sun than to the moon,
owing to the fact that the latter rules the night, when the imagination
is roused to activity by the deep shadows and the mysterious gloom,
still there cluster about the sun many curious ideas, that, apart from
their value to the antiquarian, are interesting to the layman, affording
as they do an insight into the life of ancient times.

These superstitions naturally relate to the widest possible range of
subjects, for, once given the idea, prevailing at one time in the
world's history, that

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

the sun was a living being, who, if he did not rule man's destiny, still
had a great share in shaping or controlling it, there is no end to the
play of the imagination respecting its influence on man's daily
existence. Therefore, what follows must necessarily be fragmentary in
its nature, impossible of extensive classification, and consequently
disconnected. The purpose is merely to place before the reader the
better known and most popular of the fancies relating to the sun that
primitive and simple-minded people of past ages created, and which,
because of the hold which superstition has ever exerted on the race, are
believed in, even in this enlightened age.

In the Ægean Islands, a land teeming with myth and legend, there are
still extant many strange superstitions respecting the sun. When the Sun
disappears from sight in the west each night, they say he has returned
to his vast kingdom in the underworld, where he dwells in a great
castle. His mother waits to receive him, and has forty loaves of bread
ready to appease his appetite; but if, by any chance, this meal is not
prepared, the famished Sun becomes a cannibal, and eats his entire
family. When he rises red, the islanders say: "He has eaten his mother.
He is crimson-hued because he yielded to his bloodthirsty inclinations,
when he found no bread to eat."

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

Others say the red colours at sunset are caused by the blood flowing
from the Sun-God when he hastens to his suicide. Curiously enough, the
Greeks regard the rising sun as ushered in through the portals of the
east each morning by the Virgin Mary. Again, the sun was regarded by the
Greeks as the symbol of perfect beauty, and they formerly painted the
sun's disk on the cheeks of a bride. Churches are still dedicated to the
Virgin beautiful as the sun, and there are many legends which relate to
maidens who boasted that their beauty excelled that of the sun, and of
the penalty they paid for making such presumptuous claims.

The Greeks regarded the orb of day as an all-seeing eye, and believed
that no deed escaped its detection. The Finns believed that even the
abode of the dead could be reached by the blissful rays of the sun.
Because the sun looked down on all men, messages were given to the Sun
that he might convey them to absent ones of a family, whom he beheld
wherever they chanced to be.

We have seen how the Greeks explained the crimson hues that accompanied
the rising sun. Its ruddy hue at sunset also called for an explanation,
and the ancients believed that, as the sun reached its vanishing point,
it gazed on the fires of hell, and these lit up its face, and the
western sky.

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

It seems to have been an almost universal belief among primitive people
that the sun and moon were the abodes of departed souls. In Isaac
Taylor's *Physical Theory of Another Life*, we read that ''the sun of
each planetary system is the house of the higher and ultimate spiritual
corporeity, and the centre of assembly to those who have passed on the
planets their preliminary era of corruptible organisation."

One of the most popular solar superstitions, and one that has survived
even to this day, is the notion that the sun dances when it rises on
Easter Day. In the middle districts of Ireland the peasants rise at an
early hour Easter morning to witness this phenomenon, which they say is
in honour of the resurrection. Brand <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76.md)
tells us this "is not confined to the humble labourer and his family,
but is scrupulously observed by many highly respectable and wealthy
families."

Sir Thomas Browne has left us the following quaint thoughts on this
subject: "We shall not, I hope," says he, "disparage the Resurrection of
our Redeemer, if we say that the sun doth not dance on Easter Day, and
though we would willingly assent unto any sympathetical exultation, yet
we cannot conceive therein any more than a topical expression. Whether
any such motion there was

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

in that day Christ arised, Scripture hath not revealed, which hath been
punctual in other records concerning solitary miracles, and the
Areopagite that was amazed at the eclipse, took no notice of this; and
if metaphorical expressions go so far, we may be bold to affirm, not
only that one sun danced, but two arose on that day; that light appeared
at his nativity, and darkness at his death, and yet a light at both; for
even that darkness was a light unto the Gentiles, illuminated by that
obscurity. That was the first time the sun set above the horizon. That,
although there were darkness above the earth, yet there was light
beneath it, nor dare we say that Hell was dark if he were in it."

In some parts of England this quaint belief in the dance of the joyful
Easter sun was regarded as the lamb playing for very gladness, in honour
of the risen Christ.

In a rare book entitled *Recreation for Ingenious Head Pieces*, the
Easter sun dance is thus referred to in an old ballad:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But, Dick, she dances such a way  
 No sun upon an Easter day  
 Is half so fine a sight."</span>

</div>

The Swabian people are firm believers in this superstition, and aver
that the Sun leaps thrice for

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

joy when it rises Easter morning; but at Rottenburg on the Neckar, the
Sun was supposed to indulge in this dance at his setting Christmas Eve.

In England, we find this belief in the Easter sun dance still extant in
parts of Yorkshire, Durham, Northumberland, and Devonshire, and it is
the custom for the maidens to rise early Easter morning that they may
witness the sight, and they also look for the lamb and flag in the
centre of the sun's disk.

There is little doubt that the northern European nations welcomed the
return of the spring sun with dancing, and the May rejoicings familiar
in Cornwall are but an expression of congratulation to the spring. We
have a similar custom in this country to-day, and May Day is a festival
celebrated with elaborate Maypole dances by the school children of New
York City. We see a striking analogy in these dances to the sun dances
of the American Indians, which were part of the ritual of their Sun
worship, and the radiating lines of ribbons from the Maypole represent
the rays of the sun, as the thongs attached to the sun-pole in the
Indians’ dance did.

The old Beltane games and dances, common in Perthshire and other parts
of Scotland until the beginning of the last century, had a solar
significance, the word "Beltane" being a derivative of

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

the compound word "Baal," the Phœnician word for sun, and "tein," the
Gælic word for fire.

Lady Wilde <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_77.md) says that "the Beltane
dance, where the participants circle about a bush hung with ribbons and
garlands, or about a lighted bush or bonfire, celebrating the returning
power of the sun, is still kept up in parts of Ireland on May Day and
that those taking part always move sunwise."

This sunwise motion is found in many customs extant to-day. In the
Scotch Highlands they still "make the deazil" around those whom they
wish well of. This superstition consists in walking three times around
the person according to the course of the sun. To circle in the opposite
direction or "withershins," is productive of evil, and brings bad luck.
We see a survival of this custom of circling about to bring luck in the
modern superstition often practised by a card-player to-day, when he
rises and walks around his chair three times to produce good luck.

According to an Icelandic saga, a woman going against the sun round a
house, and waving a cloth, brought down a landslip against the house,
and in Yorkshire it is said that if you walk round the room against the
sun at midnight, in perfect darkness, and then look into a mirror, you
will see leering out of it at you the face of the devil.

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

In *Popular Romances of the West of England*, by Robert Hunt, there is
the following description of a superstitious belief that the sun never
shines on a perjured person: "When a man has deeply perjured himself,
especially if by his perjury he has sacrificed the life of a friend, he
not merely loses the enjoyment of the sunshine, but he actually loses
all consciousness of its light or its warmth. Howsoever bright the sun
may shine, the weather appears to him gloomy, dark, and cold. I have
recently been told of a man living in the western part of Cornwall, who
is said to have sworn away the life of an innocent person. The face of
this false witness is said to be the colour of one long in the tomb, and
he has never, since the death of the victim of his forswearing, seen the
sun. It must be remembered the perjured man is not blind, all things
round him are seen as by other men, but the sense of vision is so dulled
that the world is forever to him in a dark vapoury cloud."

Among the Tunguses, an accused man has to walk toward the sun
brandishing a knife, and crying: "If I am guilty, may the sun send
sickness to rage in my bowels like this knife."

The appearance of three suns, it is said, denotes war. It is claimed
that they are only visible at sunrise, and differ in size. At
Herbertingen, they aver that these three suns have frequently

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

been seen, and that they appeared just before Napoleon's disastrous
campaign in Russia. The largest sun in this case was in the northern
direction, and they say that is why the Russians triumphed.

The sun is also an important factor in Mexican superstition. The
following cases are typical, and their injunctions closely followed by
the people of that country:

The head of the bed must never be placed toward the rising sun, since it
will cause the sleeper to rise with a bad headache, and even insanity
may result. The sun is also appealed to whenever a tooth drops out, or
is extracted. When this occurs, the loser takes the tooth and throws it
with all his might at the sun.

When the sun sets on a cloudy day, the following day will be a stormy
one. The Mexicans also have a belief that blondes cannot see the sun.

In Germany it is the custom on St. John's Day for hunters to fire at the
sun, believing that they will thereby become infallible hunters.
According to another German belief, he who on St. John's Day fires
toward the sun is condemned to hunt forever afterward, like Odin, the
eternal hunter.

We are all familiar with the phrase, "the sun is drawing water," used to
express the appearance of the sun's rays as they filter through spaces
in the

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

clouds, and spread out like a fan over a body of water. This expression
arose from the fact that primitive people fancied the sun's rays on
these occasions resembled ropes that ran over the pulleys of the
old-fashioned draw wells.

A very strange belief is that of the Namaqua Hottentots, that the sun is
a bright piece of bacon, which the people who go in ships draw up in the
evening by enchantment, and let down again after they have cut a piece
off from it.

There is a curious custom found in many parts of the world, which
relates to the sun's influence on young maidens entering on womanhood.
According to this superstition, these maidens must not touch the ground
nor permit the sun to shine upon them. In Fiji, brides who were being
tattooed were hidden from the rays of the sun, and in a modern Greek
folk-tale the Fates predict that in her fifteenth year a princess must
be careful not to let the sun shine on her lest she be turned into a
lizard. A Tyrolese story tells how it was the doom of a lovely maiden to
be transported into the belly of a whale if ever a sunbeam fell on her.

The old Greek legend of Danaë, who was imprisoned by her father in a
dungeon, or brazen tower, is a further illustration of this strange idea
relating to the sun's influence on human affairs.

The following solar superstitions show the wide

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

play of man's fancy as relating to the power of the sun's light and
indicate that there was a belief that the sun was a devout Christian,
and kept the holy days prescribed by the Church:

For the sun to shine upon a bride is a good omen.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "While that others do divine  
Blest is the bride on whom the sun doth shine."  
                            HERRICK'S *Hesperides*.</span>

</div>

If the sun shines while it rains, the witches are baking cakes.

The Mexicans say when it rains, and the sun is shining, a she-wolf is
bringing forth her offspring, or a liar is paying his debts.

If the sun shines on Candlemas Day (February 2d), the flax will prosper.

If women dance in the sun at Candlemas their flax will thrive that year.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As far as the sun shines in on Candlemas Day  
 So far will the snow blow in before May:  
 As far as the snow blows in on Candlemas Day  
 So far will the sun shine in before May."

"If the sun in red should set,  
 The next day surely will be wet;  
 If the sun should set in grey,  
 The next will be a rainy day."

</div>

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

When the sun does not shine, all treasures buried in the earth are open.

If the sun shines on Easter Day, it will shine on Whitsunday also.

On Good Friday the sun mourns over the Crucifixion, and does not shine
until three o'clock in the afternoon.

The sun is obliged to shine for a short time at least every Sunday in
order that the Blessed Virgin may dry her veil.

Three Saturdays in the year, when the Virgin Mary mourns, the sun does
not shine at all.

From an old Dream Book we derive the following superstitions:

To dream you see the sun shine, shows accumulation of riches and
enjoying posts of honour in the state, also success to the lover.

To dream you see the sun rise, promises fidelity in your sweetheart, and
good news from friends.

To dream you see the sun set, shows infidelity in your sweetheart, and
disagreeable news. To tradesmen, loss of business.

To dream you see the sun under a cloud, foretells many hardships and
troubles are about to befall you, and that you will encounter some great
danger.
