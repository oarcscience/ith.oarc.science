### Chapter VII

#### Sun Worship (*Continued*)

*Sun Worship in India*

IN India, a land teeming with mythology, we find as we might expect, Sun
worship a predominant feature of the Hindu religion. All the myths prove
that the fancied combat between light and darkness, waged daily in the
spacious field of the firmament, is of solar origin. As we have seen
Osiris, the Sun-God of the Egyptians, triumphing over the demons of
darkness, so in India we find Indra, the great solar deity of the
Hindus, successful in his combat with Vritra the serpent of night.

The worship of Indra constitutes the very essence of the Vedic religion,
although he was by no means the only Sun-God worshipped in India, for
the Hindus worshipped the sun in its various aspects after the manner of
the Egyptians. The rising sun was called "Brahma, "on the meridian it
was known as "Siva," and in the west at nightfall, "Vishnu."

"In regard to Vishnu," says Keary, "the great

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

epic of the Hindus relates that when he was armed for the fight Agni
gave him a wheel with a thunderbolt nave. This can only mean a wheel
that shoots out thunderbolts from its nave when it turned." <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md) The wheel has throughout the ages
symbolised the sun.

In Central India, Sun worship still prevails among many of the hill
tribes, and the Sun is invoked as the Holy One, the Creator, and
Preserver. White animals are sacrificed to him by his votaries.

One of the early and most important Sun-Gods was Sûrya. He is
represented as moving daily across the sky in a golden chariot drawn by
seven white horses. Perhaps the most holy verse in the Veda is the
following short prayer to the Sun-God Sûrya taken from the Rig Veda, an
invocation powerful in expression, and beautiful in thought:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sing praises unto Sûrya, to the son of Dyaus,  
 May this my truthful speech guard me on every side wherever heaven and
earth and days are spread abroad.  
 All else that is in motion finds a place of rest. The waters ever flow,
and ever mounts the sun.  
 No godless man from time remotest draws thee down when thou art driving
forth with wingèd dappled steeds.  
 He turns him to an alien region of the east, and Sûrya thou ariseth
with a different light. <span id="page_165">p. 165</span>  
 O Sûrya: with the light whereby thou scatterest gloom, and with thy ray
impellest every moving thing,  
 Keep far from us all feeble worthless sacrifice, and drive away disease
and every evil dream.  
 Sent forth, thou guardest well the path of every man, and in thy wonted
way ariseth free from wrath.  
 When, Sûrya, we address our prayers to thee to-day, may the gods favour
this our purpose and desire.  
               .         .         .         .         .         .         .  
 Ne’er may we suffer want in presence of the sun, and living happy lives
may we attain our age.  
 Cheerful in spirit, evermore, and keen of sight, with store of
children, free from sickness and from sin.  
               .         .         .         .         .         .         .  
 O Sûrya, with the golden hair, ascend for us day after day, still
bringing purer innocence.  
 Bless us with shine, bless us with perfect daylight, bless us with
cold, with fervent heat and lustre.  
 Bestow on us, O Sûrya, varied riches to bless us in our home, and when
we travel."</span>

</div>

The ancient Sun worship of India is reflected in the daily religious
rites and festivals of the modern Hindus. Thus, the time-honoured
formula repeated daily since long past ages by every Brahman, indicates
clearly the divine element in the sun: "Let us meditate on the desirable
light of the divine sun, may he rouse our minds." Here is a direct
appeal to a solar deity, and every morning the Brahmans may be seen
facing the east, standing on one foot, and stretching out

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

their hands to the sun as they repeat this prayer which has come down
unchanged from remote ages.

The Zoroastrians, and the modern exponents of that faith, the Parsees,
saw in the sun fire and light, a manifestation of a divine and
omnipotent power, and regarded them in a measure as symbols of the
deity; but there can be little doubt that this distinction was not
always borne out, and that the sun, and fire itself, were literally
worshipped by them.

In the Parsee temples burns a fire which, it is said, has never been
extinguished since it was kindled by Zoroaster four thousand years ago.
In praying, the Parsees are admonished to stand before the fire, and
turn their faces toward the sun, and when a young Brahman's head is
tonsured, he is to this day so placed that he has the sacred fire to the
east whence comes the sun of which it is a type.

*Sun Worship in Greece*

The ancient Sun-God of the Pelasgians, displaced by the later worship of
Apollo, was Arês. "There can be no question," says Keary, <span
id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md) "that in prehistoric times the worship of
Arês was

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

widely extended. Traces of his worship are to be found in the Zeus
Areios who was honoured at Elis, and in the name of Areiopagus of
Athens." Little actual knowledge of this early worship however has come
down to us.

The two great solar divinities of Greece were Helios or Hyperion, and
Phœbus Apollo. Just as the Egyptians regarded their Sun-Gods Ra and
Osiris as distinct aspects of the sun, so the Greeks distinguished the
orb from the rays of the sun.

Helios represented to the Greeks the physical phenomenon of light, the
orb of the sun which throughout the seasons rises and sets daily. Phœbus
Apollo, on the contrary, was the beneficent divinity who not only
created the warmth of spring-tide, but protected mankind from the
dangers and diseases of the more desolate seasons. He was essentially
human in his sympathies and yet wholly godlike in dignity.

Some writers, notably Hesiod, regard Hyperion as the father of the sun,
moon, and dawn, and therefore the original Sun-God, and the father of
Phœbus Apollo, but Homer identifies Helios with Hyperion as "he who
walks on high."

The worship of the Sun-God Helios, the counterpart of the Latin Sol, was
imported into Greece from Asia, but by no means gained a high degree

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

of popularity. The number seven was sacred to Helios, and in the island
of Trinacria (supposed to be Sicily), it was said he had seven herds of
cows, and seven herds of lambs, fifty in each herd, which never
increased or diminished in numbers. The god delighted to watch them
peacefully grazing when he rose in the morning, and as he left the sky
at night-fall. As we shall see later in the chapter on the solar
mythology of Greece, and as related in the Odyssey, the sacred herds of
Helios were ruthlessly slaughtered by the misguided companions of
Ulysses. Incensed by this insult the Sun-God threatened to descend into
Hades and shine among the dead. He contented himself, however, by
complaining to Jove, who, acknowledging the justice of his claim for
vengeance, roused up a mighty storm which well-nigh destroyed the
miscreants, and completely disabled their ship. Tylor <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md) tells us that the Greek Sun-God Helios, to
whom horses were sacrificed on the mountain top of Taygetos, was that
same personal Sun to whom Socrates, when he had stayed rapt in thought
till daybreak, offered a prayer before he departed. An annual festival
in honour of Helios was celebrated at Rhodes with musical and athletic
contests.

The Greeks believed that the Sun rose out of

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

the ocean on the eastern side, and drove through the air in a chariot
giving light to gods and men. The poet Milton in his *Comus* thus refers
to the daily journey of the Sun-God:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The star that bids the shepherd fold  
 Now the top of heaven doth hold,  
 And the gilded car of Day  
 His glowing axle doth allay  
 In the steep Atlantic stream,  
 And the slope Sun his upward beam  
 Shoots across the dusky pole,  
 Pacing toward the other goal  
 Of his chamber in the east."</span>

</div>

In Lucian's time the Greeks kissed their hands as an act of worship to
the rising Sun.

Shakespeare frequently alludes to Hyperion, and Keats wrote of his
downfall, and of the accession of his successor Phœbus Apollo.

We come now to a consideration of the preeminent feature of Hellenic Sun
worship, the worship of the Sun-God Phœbus Apollo, the god who is more
especially the deity of the later Greeks, the Dorians and Ionians.

The authors of this religion were probably the Dorians, who inhabited
the northern portion of Greece, and who founded their first kingdom in
Crete. Before the Doric invasion, however, there was in Crete a species
of Sun worship, for the bull-

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

headed Minotaur, according to the authorities, could hardly have been
anything else than a Sun-God of the Asiatic stamp.

With the coming of the Dorians to Crete, Apollo worship was established,
and through the migrations of these people (about the tenth century
before our era), the cult of Phœbus Apollo spread on every side, until
this religion was in favour wherever the Greek language was spoken.

In Homer, Apollo is easily the greatest of all the Sun-Gods, and
superior in character to almost every other deity. In the Iliad he is
the central and most majestic figure.

Phœbus Apollo, or "Far-Darter" as he is sometimes called, was the son of
Jupiter and Latona, and brother of Diana, the Moon Goddess. He was born
on Delos, the smallest and most desolate of all the Ægean Islands, after
all other places had rejected him. Delos, however, was a most
appropriate birthplace for a Sun-God, as the ancients believed that the
Sun was born from the sea. His name, Phœbus, signifies the glorious
nature of the light of the sun, while the name Apollo probably had
reference to the devastating effects of the sun's rays at mid-day.

At the birth of the Sun-God on the seventh day of the month, we are told
that sacred swans made the circuit of the island seven times, and all
the

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

attendant goddesses gave a shout, and Delos was radiant in golden light.
We have here, it is said, the echo of an old belief, that at the hour of
sunrise the horizon sends forth a sound.

Zeus bestowed on the infant Apollo a cap, a lyre, and a car drawn by
swans. Soon after his birth the swans carried Apollo off to the land of
the Hyperboreans, where for six months of the year the climate is marked
by sunshine and gentle breezes. Here the Sun-God thrived and waxed
vigorous. It is not within the scope of this chapter to dwell on the
myths that tell of the mighty deeds of the Far-Darter, as they come
properly under the chapter on solar mythology. The establishment,
however, of the Delphinian oracle, perhaps the most important event in
the life of the Sun-God, is related here, as Delphi was, properly
speaking, the seat of Apollo worship.

At an early date Apollo developed the attributes of a warrior, and set
out in the quest of adventure. Searching for a suitable place in which
to establish an oracle, he came to Delphi, a peaceful vale in Crissa, in
the heart of Greece. Its solitude and sublimity completely charmed him
and he chose it as the site of his oracle. His advent was not peaceable,
however, as Hera had set in his path the great serpent Pytho, and a
terrific combat ensued from which Apollo emerged victorious. Some

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

authorities claim that this contest with Pytho signifies the war which,
according to many mythologies, the Sun-God wages with the River God. The
great river is the earth which flows all around the world, and which the
Greeks knew by the name "Oceanus."

Perhaps, in the widest significance, this battle between Phœbus Apollo
and the serpent represents the contest between the Sun-God and the earth
river, for the Sun, although seemingly conquered by Oceanus each night,
and smothered in his coils, emerges triumphant in the morning.

From his victory over Pytho, Apollo obtained the title of "Pythius, "and
in commemoration of the event the Pythian games were instituted, in
which contests the victors were crowned with wreaths of beech leaves.

His foes vanquished, the first requisite of an oracle, a priest was
sought, and it is related that Apollo cast his eyes seaward and beheld a
Cretan ship sailing for Pylos. Assuming the form of a dolphin he plunged
into the sea, and boarded the ship to the great amazement of the crew.
Under his guidance they came to the bay of Crissa, and the god in the
form of a blazing star left the ship and descended into his temple.
Assuming the form of a handsome youth with wavy locks, he greeted the
crew as strangers, and invited them to

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

land, and worship him as Apollo Delphinus, as he had met them in the
form of a dolphin, and hence Delphi derived its name.

 

The resemblance between the lives of the Sun-God Phœbus Apollo, and
Jesus Christ, the central figure and Exemplar of the Christian religion,
is striking. The circumstances of their birth were in many respects
similar, in that they were born in comparative obscurity. The mother of
Apollo sought in vain for a suitable place to bring forth her offspring,
and had recourse at last to a desolate and barren island in the midst of
the sea. The Virgin Mary found her only refuge in a comfortless and
humble shelter for the beasts of the field. Three gifts were presented
the Far-Darter at his birth by Zeus, and the Magi presented the same
number of gifts to the infant Jesus. Further, the infant Apollo was
hurried away to a peaceful land soon after his birth, and in like manner
the child Jesus was conveyed to a place of safety to escape a threatened
danger.

For a while Phœbus Apollo hid his greatness in a beggar's garb, bearing
with patience the gibes and sneers of his comrades, preferring to bide
his time when all men should acknowledge his greatness. This mode of
existence was in every way similar to the life of Christ.

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

Again, as personifying the sun, Phœbus Apollo must necessarily be born
weak and suffer hardships, he must wander far and lead a life of strife
and action, but above all it was imperative that he should die. It is
this last act which makes the character of the Sun-God approach the
nearest to human nature.

Although the Sun-God's death at night-fall is ignominious, akin in this
respect to the crucifixion, still its predominant feature is one of
glory, and the reappearance of the triumphant sun after death is in
every way typical of the resurrection, thus portraying in a startling
manner the completeness of the analogy between the lives of Christ and
Apollo.

In the Homeric hymn to Apollo we read that the Far-Darter took the shape
of a dolphin, and guided men from Crete to Crissa. "This plunging of the
god into the water, and his taking the shape of a fish," says
Keary, <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md) "is the setting of the sun,
and the birth of Apollo in the mid-Ægean is his rising. Both are alike
parts of the sun's daily journey."

Again, the sun is essentially nomadic in its character, a continual
wanderer in the firmament and this characteristic is borne out in the
life of Phœbus Apollo, who in his infancy started upon his

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

travels, his life being one of ceaseless wandering and activity.

Apollo brought not only the blessings of the harvest to mankind, but he
was the god of music and song. He founded great cities, and promoted
colonisation, gave good laws, and in a word, was "the ideal of fair and
manly youth, a pure and just god requiring clean hands of those who
worshipped him." To him were sacred the wolf, the roe, the mouse, the
he-goat, the swan, the dolphin, and the ram. Traces of his solar nature
are revealed in some of the statues, which represent him with a full and
flowing beard, typifying the sun's rays. Generally he is represented as
having the figure of a youthful athlete.

It remains to mention the different titles conferred on Phœbus Apollo.
The many festivals inaugurated in his honour are referred to in another
chapter. As there is a beneficent side to the sun's character, displayed
in its genial warmth, so there is a destructive and desolating force in
its rays at mid-day. As a destroyer and producer of plagues Phœbus
Apollo was styled "Carneius," and worshipped with particular zeal at
Sparta. In this capacity he was also worshipped under the title
"Hyacinthus," a worship that was for the most part peculiar to the
Peloponnesus.

As a beneficent god the Far-Darter was styled

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Thargelius." The
most noted of the temples dedicated to his worship was situated at
Amyclæ.

Apollo was regarded as the patron of herdsmen, and in this capacity was
called "Nomius." He was also styled "Delphinius," and worshipped in a
temple at Athens which bore the name "Delphinian."

From the fact that the number seven was sacred to Apollo he was called
"Hebdomeius." As a god of light he was styled "Lycius," the original
centre of this worship being Lycia, in the southwest of Asia Minor.
Apollo was regarded as the father of Æsculapius, the god of medicine,
and those afflicted with disease had recourse to him, for through his
kind offices their bodies were purified, and health regained.

In Rome, the worship of Apollo was not established until 320 B.C., a
temple being raised to him in that year in consequence of a pestilence
that had swept the city. Afterwards a second temple was dedicated to his
worship on the Palatine Hill.

To the poets of all ages Phœbus Apollo has been a source of inspiration,
and the symbol of poetry. Callimachus, an Alexandrine Greek, who lived
about 250 B.C., wrote a hymn in honour of the Sun-God Apollo. In later
times, however, no distinction was made by the Greek poets between
Apollo and the Sun-God Helios.

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

The poet Keats wrote an ode and a hymn to Apollo, and Shelley's Hymn to
Apollo is considered one of the finest and most sublime poems in our
language. It is the Sun-God's description of his divine attributes, and
because of its beauty is quoted in full:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The sleepless Hours who watch me as I lie,  
 Curtained with star-inwoven tapestries  
 From the broad moonlight of the sky,  
 Fanning the busy dreams from my dim eyes.  
 Waken me when their mother, the grey Dawn,  
 Tells them that dreams and that the moon is gone.

"Then I arise, and climbing Heaven's blue dome,  
 I walk over the mountains and the waves,  
 Leaving my robe upon the ocean foam;  
 My footsteps pave the clouds with fire; the caves  
 Are filled with my bright presence, and the air  
 Leaves the green earth to my embraces bare.

"The sunbeams are my shafts with which I kill  
 Deceit, that loves the night and fears the day;  
 All men who do or even imagine ill  
 Fly me, and from the glory of my ray  
 Good minds and open actions take new might  
 Until diminished by the reign of night.

"I feed the clouds, the rainbows, and the flowers  
 With their ethereal colours; the moon's globe  
 And the pure stars in their eternal bowers  
 Are cinctured with my power as with a robe;  
 Whatever lamps on Earth or Heaven may shine  
 Are portions of one power, which is mine.<span id="page_178">p.
178</span>

"I stand at noon upon the peak of Heaven,  
 Then with unwilling steps I wander down  
 Into the clouds of the Atlantic even;  
 For grief that I depart they weep and frown.  
 What look is more delightful than the smile  
 With which I soothe them from the western isle?

"I am the eye with which the Universe  
 Beholds itself and knows itself divine;  
 All harmony of instrument or verse,  
 All prophecy, all medicine are mine,  
 All light of Art or Nature; to my song  
 Victory and praise in their own right belong."

</div>

The Dorians, as they migrated and founded new kingdoms, found the
worship of the Sun-God Herakles flourishing in other lands, and
gradually this form of religion became popular and supplanted the
worship of Apollo.

Herakles was, however, considered more in the light of a solar hero than
a Sun-God. In Herakles we behold the Sun, loving and beloved, wherever
he goes seeking to benefit the sons of men; yet, as was the case with
Apollo, sometimes bringing destruction and desolation down upon them
through the fierce heat of his noonday rays.

The twelve labours of Herakles are supposed to refer to the sun's
passage through the Zodiacal signs, as they suggest forcibly in many
cases the successive conquests of the Sun hero. Herakles was represented
on coins of Cyzicus about 500-450 B.C.

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The death of
Herakles is the most impressive incident of his varied career. "No one,"
says Keary, <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md) "who reads the account
of it, can fail to be struck by the likeness of the picture to an image
of the setting sun. . . . The flame of his pyre shines out far over the
sea, and the sun's last rays shine out in the light of the fiery sky."
The many myths related of the Sun hero, Herakles, are referred to in the
chapter on solar mythology.

*Japanese Sun Worship*

In the spirit religion of Japan we find the worship of the Sun-God is
supreme. He is regarded as the "heaven-enlightening great spirit,—below
him stand all the lesser spirits through whom as mediators, guardians,
and protectors, worship is paid by men."

Among the Shinto deities, however, the Sun-Goddess was the central
figure. To reconcile Buddhism and Shintoism the chief priests claimed
that the Sun-Goddess had been merely an incarnation of Buddha.

The shrine of the Sun-Goddess stood in the Mikado's residence, and was
reverenced by that monarch as one of his family gods. Her emblem was the
mirror, which is to the present day considered

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

one of the sacred treasures of the Japanese sovereigns.

A temple of the Sun-Goddess was established at Watarahi in the province
of Isé, and the shrine of the Goddess of Food was placed in the temple.
These two deities henceforth occupy together the chief place in the
Japanese Pantheon. They were honoured above all other gods by festivals
and ceremonies held annually. Offerings and sacrifices were presented to
these goddesses on the seventeenth day of the sixth moon, and the ritual
of the invocation was in part as follows: "Hear, all you ministers of
the gods, and sanctifiers of offerings, the great ritual declared in the
presence of the From-Heaven-Shining-Great Deity."

At the harvest festival thanksgiving was offered to the Sun-Goddess for
bestowing upon her descendants dominion over land and sea.

*Sun Worship in Peru and Mexico*

From Japan we cross the Pacific to find the indigenous tribes of the
western continents reverencing and worshipping the Sun in ancient times.
The Sun worship of Peru first claims our attention, as it easily
overshadows in importance and magnificence the solar worship of any
other of the western tribes.

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

It has been shown that Sun worship prevails, for the most part, where
the sun is welcomed for his genial warmth, and where nature suffers at
his departure. Thus, in the lowlands of South America, Sun worship
attained little prominence, but on the high plateaus, such as those in
Peru, it flourished vigorously, and was the dominant feature of the life
of the natives.

The Peruvians believed that the Sun was at once the ancestor and the
founder of the Inca dynasty, and that the Incas reigned as his
representatives and almost in his person. The Sun, therefore, was the
sovereign lord of the world, the king of heaven and earth, and was
called by them "Inti," which signifies Light.

The Peruvian villages were so built that the inhabitants could have an
unobstructed view of the east, in order that each morning the nation
might unite in saluting the rising Sun, and rejoice in the advent of the
Lord of Light. The Sun alone of all the deities had a temple in every
large town in Peru.

The Peruvian Sun temples probably exceeded in magnificence those of any
other nation on the earth. In Peru, as elsewhere, a certain relationship
was thought to exist between the substance of gold, and that of the sun.
In the nuggets dislodged from the mountain sides they thought they

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

saw the Sun's tears, consequently, in the Peruvian edifices dedicated to
the worship of the Sun, we find gold used lavishly to beautify and
embellish the structure.

The following description of the Great Temple of the Sun at Cuzco, the
grandest ecclesiastical edifice in the empire, gives some idea of the
beauty and grandeur of these places of worship:

The temple consisted of a vast central auditorium surrounded by a number
of smaller buildings and was built with an elegance of masonry rarely,
if ever, equalled.

The roof was formed by timberworks of precious woods plated with gold,
and the precious metal was so prodigally lavished on the interior that
the temple bore the name of "The Place of Gold" or "Golden Palace." A
thick sheet of gold six inches wide ran round the outside of the edifice
as a frieze, and there was a similar decoration in every apartment. The
doors opened to the east, and at the far end above the altar was a
golden disk with human countenance shaped and graven to represent the
sun, and studded with precious stones. It was so placed as to reflect,
at certain seasons, the first rays of the rising sun on its brilliant
surface, and, as it were, reproduce the likeness of the great luminary.

Around the sacred disk was arranged in a semi-circle

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

the mummies of the departed Incas seated on golden thrones, so that the
morning sun rays came day by day to bless the remains of the rulers of
bygone ages.

The adjacent buildings were the abodes of the deities who formed the
retinue of the Sun. The principal one was sacred to the Moon, the Sun's
consort, who had her disk of silver, and arranged around her were the
mummies of the ancient queens. Other chambers in the temple were
dedicated to the stars, to lightning, and to the rainbow. Outside the
temple was a great garden filled with rare and beautiful plants, which
contained, also, exquisite imitations of trees, bushes, and flowering
shrubs, and animals all wrought in solid gold. The vases and temple
ornaments, all the utensils used by the priests in the temple, and even
the conductor pipes, were composed of the precious metal.

In the Peruvian ceremonials of Sun worship, drink offerings were
presented to the deity in a golden vessel, and the people believed that
if the liquid disappeared the Sun partook of it, which might be truly
said of it, as it soon vanished by evaporation.

Under the Incas, Sun worship became the state religion of Peru, and the
central idea of the life of the people. It is evident, however, that Sun

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

worship was not acceptable to all the Incas, for there is on record a
protest made by an Inca that the Sun could not be a supreme and
all-powerful deity, constrained as he was to pursue one fixed course in
the firmament. If he was supreme he should be a free agent, argued this
wise sovereign.

Columns in honour of the Sun were erected in Peru as in other lands
where Sun worship prevailed, level at the top, so as to form a seat for
the sun who, the Peruvians said, "loved to rest upon them." At the
equinoxes and solstices they placed golden thrones upon them for the
Sun-God's further convenience. Surrounding the city of Cuzco there were
twelve stone columns dedicated to the sun, which represented the twelve
months in the year.

Human sacrifices to the sun were common in Peru, and the rising sun
looked down on sacrificial altars reddened by the blood of thousands of
victims. The holiest sacrifice was the blood of a captive youth, smeared
on a rock that crowned a mountain top, so that the sun's first rays
would light up the gory sacrifice.

Sun worship thrived in Peru until the Spanish Conquest, when Pizarro
ruthlessly overthrew the temples, and stifled the religion. It is said
that the great golden disk representing the sun, that was the chief
object of worship in the Great Temple

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

at Cuzco, was secured as booty by one of the rough adventurers of the
conquering army, and became the stake in a subsequent drunken gambling
bout that the plunderer engaged in.

Although the Sun worship of the Peruvians reached a higher state of
exaltation, and perfection than that of any other South American people,
still the pre-eminence of the Sun, and its deification, was the very
essence of the early religion of Central America, and particularly
Mexico. The ancient Mexicans called themselves "Children of the Sun,"
and daily greeted the rising sun with hymns of praise, and offered to
the solar deity a share of their meat and drink. Even to this day, the
inhabitants of the interior of Mexico, as they go to mass, throw a kiss
to the Sun before entering the church.

Four times by day and night the priests of the ancient Sun temples
addressed their invocations and prayers to the Sun, and all the temples
were dedicated to his worship. In the ceremonial of the temple worship,
blood drawn from the ears of the high priest was offered to the Sun, as
was also a sacrifice of quails. The priest invoked the Sun saying: "The
Sun has risen, we know not how he will fulfil his course, nor whether
misfortune will happen. Our Lord do your office prosperously."

The temples of the ancient Toltecs, who inhabited Mexico as far back as
the year 674 of the

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Christian era,
were dedicated to the Sun. The Moon they worshipped as his wife, and the
Stars as his sisters. No image was allowed within these temples, and
their offerings were perfumed flowers, and sweet-scented gums. They
reared in adoration of the Sun and Moon great pyramids which have
endured to this day and examples of which may be seen at San Juan,
Teotihuacan.

The highest "El Sol" is 216 feet in height, has a base about 761 feet
square, and the summit is reached by a flight of sixty-eight steps. Many
strange idols have been found in this region embellished and ornamented
with designs of solar significance, the sun's rays being especially
noticeable in the carvings.

The supreme god of the early Mexicans was Quetzalcohuatl, who
personified to them the Sun of to-day; his father was Camaxtli, the
great Toltec conqueror, whom the Mexicans regarded as the Sun of
yesterday:—while the god Tetzcalipoca signified to them the Sun of
to-morrow.

Quetzalcohuatl is described as being regal of stature, of white
complexion, and of pleasing countenance. His face was fair, and his
beard bushy, and he was clothed in flowing robes. It is related that the
clouds, or cloud snakes, bear down the old Sun, and choke him, but the
young Quetzalcohuatl rushes up in the midst of them from

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

below, and destroys them. As we shall see, the Sun-God Hercules, the
solar deity of the Greeks, was famed even in his infancy for his triumph
over the serpents sent to destroy him.

Quetzalcohuatl reigned over the Toltecs peaceably for many years, but
finally his enemies brought about his downfall, and deposed him. Legend
says he embarked in his ship and sailed down a river to the sea, where
he disappeared and was no more seen. When Montezuma beheld Cortez and
the Spanish ships approaching the land, he thought that the great
Sun-God was returning to his beloved land.

*Sun Worship of the North American Indians*

Proceeding northward, we find the worship of the Sun that anciently
existed and flourished in the far east, equally prominent in the life of
the early Indian tribes of North America.

The chiefs of the Huron tribe claimed descent from the Sun, and believed
that the sacred pipe was derived from this luminary. It was, they
thought, first presented to the Pawnees, and by them transmitted to the
other tribes. Many of the Indian tribes have a similar tradition.

The Iroquois regarded the Sun as a god, and offered him tobacco, which
they termed "smoking the Sun." On important occasions the braves

<span id="page_.188">p. .188</span>

gathered together in a circle, squatting on the ground, the chief then
lighting the calumet, and offering it thrice to the rising Sun,
imploring his protection, and recommending the tribe to his care. The
chief next took several puffs and passed the pipe on for all the others
to smoke in turn. As in many Christian churches to-day, the prayers of
the people mingle with the smoke of incense, so were the invocations of
the early Indians addressed to their Sun deity, supposed to be wafted to
him by the smoke that wreathed upward from the sacred calumet.

Certain tribes offered to the Sun the first game they despatched when
they were out on a hunting expedition. The Apalachees of Florida, in
their sacrifices to the Sun, offered nothing that had life. They
regarded the Sun as the parent of life, and thought that he looked with
displeasure on the destruction of any living creature. They saluted the
Sun at the doors of their wigwams as he rose and set, and in the sacred
hut or cave where they worshipped, the Sun's rays were permitted to
enter so as to illuminate the altar at certain times of ceremonial
importance. This accords closely with the ideas of orientation which
played such an important part in the Sun temple worship of the
Egyptians. In the course of their service of Sun worship, the Apalachees
released the sacred Sun

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

birds through a crevice in the roof of the cave temple. These, as they
winged their way upward, were thought to convey their expressions of
adoration to the Sun, the supreme deity.

To the Creeks the Sun represented the Great Spirit, toward him they
directed the first puff of smoke from the calumet, as they sat in solemn
council, and to him they bowed reverently in their discussions. The
early Indian tribes of Virginia prostrated themselves before the rising
and setting Sun and Tylor <span id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57.md) tells us
that the Pottawotomies would climb sometimes at sunrise to the roofs of
their huts to kneel, and offer to the luminary a mess of Indian corn.

The powerful Sioux tribe regarded the Sun as the Creator and Preserver
of all things and to him they sacrificed the best of the game they
killed in the hunt. The Shawnees believed that the Sun animated
everything, and therefore must be the Master of Life or Great Spirit.

The Sun worship of the Indian tribes dwelling in the southern portions
of North America seems to have been on a more elaborate scale than that
in vogue in the north. Doubtless it was influenced by the widely
extended and exalted Sun worship of the South American tribes. Among the
tribes inhabiting what is now the state of Louisiana, it

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

was customary for the chief to face the east each morning, and prostrate
himself before the rising Sun. He also smoked toward it, and then toward
the three other cardinal points of the compass. These Indians even
erected to the Sun a rude temple, a circular hut some thirty feet in
diameter. In the midst of it was kept burning a perpetual fire, prayers
were offered to the Sun three times each day, and the hut was the
repository of images and religious relics. Following the Inca custom,
the bones of their departed chiefs were also placed in the sacred
structure. Their highest and most powerful chief was regarded as the
Sun's brother, and he conducted as high priest the temple service of
worship to the Sun.

The Dakota Indians called the Sun "the mysterious one of day," and
believed that this deity watched over them in time of need. The
following translation from portions of an Indian hymn to the Sun
indicates the attitude of the worshippers toward their deity:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Great Spirit, master of our lives,  
Great Spirit master of all things visible and invisible, and who daily
makes them visible and invisible,  
Great Spirit master of every other Spirit good or bad,  
Command the good to be favourable unto us, and deter the bad from the
commission of evil.  
               .         .         .         .         .         .         .
<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>  
O Great Spirit, when hidden in the west protect us from our enemies who
violate the night, and do evil when thou art not present,  
Make known to us your pleasure by sending to us the Spirit of Dreams.  
               .         .         .         .         .         .         .  
O Great Spirit, sleep not longer in the gloomy west, but return and call
your people to light and life.</span>

</div>

Brinton <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) tells us that the Algonquins
did not regard the Sun as a divinity but merely as a symbol. They called
the Sun "Wigwam of the Great Spirit," and they prayed not to the Sun but
to the old man who dwelt in the Sun.

Fire worship is closely related to Sun worship, and in many cases the
North American Indians regarded fire, and not the Sun, as the Creator of
all things, and the Supreme Deity.

The Choctaws refer to fire as "the greater chief," and speak of it as
"he who accompanies the Sun, and the Sun him." In preparing for war they
invoke the aid of both the Sun and Fire.

The following Ottawa legend <span id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_59.md) is of
much interest as showing clearly the motives with which savage animists
offer sacrifices to their deities, and the spirit in which they believe
the gods accept them:

"Onowuttokwutto, the Ojibwa youth who has followed the moon up to the
lovely heaven prairies,

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

to be her husband, is taken one day by her brother the Sun to see how he
gets his dinner. The two look down together through the hole in the sky
upon the earth below. The Sun points out a group of children playing
beside a lodge, at the same time throwing a tiny stone to hit a
beautiful boy. The child falls, they see him carried into the lodge,
they hear the sound of the rattle, and the song and prayers of the
medicine man that the child's life might be spared. To the entreaty of
the medicine man the Sun makes answer: 'Send me up the white dog.' Then
the two spectators above could distinguish on the earth the hurry and
bustle of preparation for a feast, a white dog killed and singed, and
the people who were called assembling at the lodge. While these things
were passing the Sun addressed himself to his youthful companion
saying:—'There are among you in the lower world some whom you call great
medicine men, but it is because their ears are open, and they hear my
voice, when I have struck any one, that they are able to give relief to
the sick. They direct the people to send me whatever I call for, and
when they have sent it I remove my hand from those I have made sick.'
When he had said this the white dog was parcelled out in dishes for
those that were at the feast, then the medicine man, when they were
about to begin to eat said, 'We send

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

thee this, Great Manito.' Immediately the Sun and his companion saw the
dog, cooked and ready to be eaten, rising to them through the air, and
then and there they dined upon it."

Of all the Indian customs and forms of worship of solar significance,
the great ceremonial of the Sun dance best exemplified their worship of
the Sun. Although it partook of the nature of a solar festival, and
might properly be included in the chapter on Solar Festivals, still the
deep religious significance of this rite, and the fact that it was
essentially an act of Sun worship, renders it in accord with the subject
under discussion. The following description of the Sun dance of the
Senecas is taken from volume xxiii., of the *Journal of American
Folk-Lore:*

"The Seneca sun dance is called by any individual who dreams that the
rite is necessary for the welfare of the community. It begins promptly
at high noon, when three showers of arrows or volleys from muskets are
shot heavenward to notify the sun of the intention to address him. After
each of the volleys the populace shout their war cries 'for the sun
loves war.' A ceremonial fire is then built, and the sun priest chants
his thanksgiving song, casting from a husk basket handfuls of native
tobacco upon the flames as he sings. This ceremony takes place outside
of the

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Long House where
the rising smoke may lift the words of the speaker to the sun.
Immediately after this the entire assemblage enters the Long House where
the costumed feather dancers start the Ostowa̋’´gowa. Among the Onondaga
of the Grand River Reserve in Ontario the leader of the sun ceremony
carries an effigy of the sun. This is a disk of wood ten inches in
diameter, fastened to a handle perhaps a foot long. The disk is painted
red, and has a border of yellow. Around the edge are stuck yellow-tipped
down feathers from some large bird to represent the sun's rays."

The great tribal ceremony of the Kiowas was the Sun dance, which was
generally celebrated each year about the middle of June. It lasted four
days, and during this time the sacred image representing a human figure,
and supposed to possess magical qualities, was exposed in the medicine
lodge. It was the only time in the year that the sacred image was
revealed to the people, and the veneration of the object was similar in
many respects to the worship paid to the alleged relics of the saints
that are now extant.

The Kiowas considered even the accidental shedding of blood at a Sun
dance an evil omen, and their ceremonies were free from the horrible
acts of self-torture that made the Sun dances of many of the Indian
tribes especially revolting.

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

A description of the Sun dance of the Sioux follows. <span
id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60.md) This is given in much detail as the
subject is of prime importance in any discussion of the solar
ceremonials of the Indian tribes.

After the day for the Sun dance had been appointed by the medicine men,
a straight and tapering pine, forty or fifty feet high, was selected for
the sun pole. This was chosen by the oldest woman in the camp, and the
task of stripping it of boughs and foliage, and clearing a passage about
it, was left to the gaily dressed maidens. This work was performed on
the second day of the ceremony. Before sunrise the next day a long line
of naked young warriors was formed, gorgeous in war paint and feathers,
bearing their weapons. This line was drawn up facing the east, and the
sun pole which was five or six hundred yards away.

Overlooking the scene, on a high hill, stood an old medicine man, whose
sole duty was to signal the moment of the sun's rising. Suddenly the
signal was given, and with a great shout the Indians mounted their
ponies and rode straight at the pole, discharging their weapons at it as
they advanced. Chips from the pole flew in all directions, and if it
fell a new pole must be selected. Later in the day the pole was cut
down, and set up in the centre of

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

a great plain, guy ropes of buffalo thongs, diverging from its top,
being used to steady it. These ropes were fastened at the lower end to
the tops of stakes which were driven in the ground at regular intervals
about the sun pole, forming a circle about it.

Early on the morning of the third day the true worship of the Sun was
begun, and a number of young warriors who had prepared for the ordeal by
fasting for a number of days, presented themselves, being placed facing
the sun. They were arrayed in full war paint and feathers, with fists
clenched across their breasts; jumping up and down in measured leaps
they circled about, keeping time to the monotonous beating of the
tom-toms. Now and then a similar group of young maidens would appear in
another part of the arena, and take up a song. The dancing continued for
intervals of from ten minutes to a quarter of an hour, broken by rests
of about equal length, and lasted from sunrise to sunset. During the day
horses were brought into the arena, and the medicine men, after many
incantations, dipped their hands into coloured earth, and smeared it on
the flanks of the animals.

On the fourth day of the Sun dance the self-torture began, the male
dancers of the previous day participating in this rite. The row of
dancers took their places promptly at sunrise, but it was not before
nine or ten o'clock that the torture

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

began. Each of the young men presented himself to a medicine man who
took between his thumb and forefinger a fold of loose skin of the
breast, and a skewer, which had been previously fastened to the lower
end of a guy rope which supported the sun pole, was then passed through
the victim's flesh. The object of the devotee was to break loose from
this fetter which bound him to the sun pole without using his hands.
This could only be accomplished by so straining against his bonds that
the skewer was torn free from the skin through which it passed. The
torture was frightful, and frequently the victims fainted under the
ordeal. All the while the beating of the tom-toms and the weird chanting
of the singers continued. When the day was about over the survivors of
the ordeal of torture filed from the arena one by one, and just outside
of it they knelt with arms crossed over their bleeding breasts, and with
bowed heads faced the setting sun. They rose only when it had
disappeared from view.

It remains to refer briefly to evidences of Sun worship in various parts
of the world, and the survivals of this cultus in the religious
observances and ceremonials of to-day.

In Rome, in the fifth century, it was the custom to bow to the sun
before entering a church, and to salute the rising sun from the summit
of a hill.

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Emperor
Constantine was an ardent votary of the sun, and it was a great triumph
for Christianity when he forsook this form of idolatry.

In Armenia forms of Sun worship exist to-day, and the Bedouins of the
Arabian Desert constantly practise the adoration of the rising Sun, in
spite of the Prophet's command against such observances.

In the Upper Palatinate it is the custom to take off the hat to the
rising sun, and in Pomerania the fever-stricken patient is admonished to
face the rising sun, and invoke the sun thrice as follows: "Dear Sun,
come down soon, and take the seventy-seven fevers from me, in the name
of the Holy Trinity."

The rude Tartar tribes sacrificed their horses to the Sun-God, whom they
say frees them from the miseries of winter, and Mongol hordes may still
be met with whose high priest prays to the sun, and throws milk up into
the air as an offering to the Sun-God.

In Australia and Polynesia solar mythology overshadows the deification
of the sun, and the early history of these regions is rich in legends
and tales of the mighty deeds of the sun hero.

No chapter on Sun worship would be complete without some reference to
Stonehenge, for Druidical worship embraced, even if it was not entirely
governed by, the sacred rites of solar worship.

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The position and
location of the group of stones on the wide plain commanding an
unobstructed view of the horizon, reveal the character of the worship of
those who placed them there as solar in its nature. Those who annually
meet at Stonehenge in the present day, at dawn on the twenty-first of
June, note that the sun rises exactly over the centre of the stone known
as "the Pointer." It has been thought by some students that the Sun
worship of the Druids was introduced into England and Ireland by
Egyptian colonists, as the rites of the Druids conform in a remarkable
degree with those attached to Sun worship in ancient Egypt. A list of
the Sun-Gods of the various nations follows, with the authorities that
establish their respective claims to solar deification. <span

In conclusion, no claim is made that the subject of Sun worship has been
treated exhaustively in the foregoing fragmentary account of this
ancient form of idolatry in many lands. The main purpose has been to
indicate how widespread solar deification was, and how, at one time or
another, it has been the central and predominant feature of the
religious life of all people.

Again, the similarity of the ceremonials and forms of Sun worship, the
sacrifices and rituals

of the various and widely separated nations of the earth, provide
features that cannot fail to interest the student of history and
ethnology.

Some of these points of resemblance are so striking as to suggest that
at an early date in the world's history there was some means of
communication between, or link that joined, the eastern and western
continents.

Because of the far-reaching influences of Sun worship—influences that
exist to-day—and by reason of its importance in the life and history of
the ancient nations, the subject must ever remain one of the most
interesting and absorbing that the life pages of the race record.
