### PUBLISHER'S NOTICE.

<span id="img_sep0"></span> ![](img/sep0.jpg)

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> reading nativities, or delineating
character in accordance with this system of science, all that is
requisite is tables of past positions of the moon and planets. We have
no need to refer to future positions, as all calculations are made from
the positions at birth; therefore, in practice, tables ten or more years
back will be in most frequent requisition; nevertheless, those of
current date will be desired for information regarding children just
born, and, as time rolls on, that which was the future constantly
becomes the present, and we have accordingly made provision for this
contingent, and have given the positions of the planets up to the close
of the nineteenth century. The ephemerides of the moon are not at
present available beyond the close of the year 1889, but after that time
it will be merely necessary each year to procure a nautical or an
astrological almanac for the current year, and from that the positions
of the moon can be had, and blank tables have been bound with the book
for each year to complete the century, into which the moon's positions
can be copied, and thus preserved in compact form; or, by enclosing 10
cents each year to the publishers of Solar Biology, a printed table of
the moon's positions, uniform with those of the work, will be forwarded
by return mail, together with a catalogue of works of a kindred nature
subsequently issued. For 1900 and thereafter, enclose 25 cents for
tables of both the moon and planets.

#### TEACHERS, LECTURERS, PHYSICIANS, AGENTS, ETC.

The publishers desire a competent person in each city and county to take
the agency of Solar Biology, which offers a useful, pleasant, and
lucrative occupation. As its introduction is not comparable to ordinary
book-canvassing, but commands attention and awakens an interest wherever
presented, and enables the possessor to give rich entertainment and rare
instruction to family groups or audiences of thousands, and therefore
offers an unparalleled opportunity to those of literary, medical, or
even of mere business aspirations; and, to be thoroughly equipped for
this work, agents and interested parties will do well to send 10 cents
for specimen lecture and catalogue of a series illustrative of this and
collateral subjects covering important lines of entertaining and
profitable thought, and suggestive of new fields of research, culture,
and unfoldment.
