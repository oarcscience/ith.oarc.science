### CHAPTER XXVII.

#### DIRECTION FOR READING CHARACTER BY THE SYSTEM OF SOLAR BIOLOGY.

<span class="smallcaps">First</span> ascertain the day of the month the
person was born; then from the following table ascertain to which of the
twelve departments or functions of the body they belong. For instance,
if born on the 21st of March or on any day prior to the 19th of April,
their function is that of Aries; and for the general particulars or
foundation qualities of that nature read the article descriptive of that
sign or function, the page of which is given opposite; and so on with
all the other signs.

#### TO FIND THE POLARITY.

Turn to the table of Ephemerides giving the positions of the moon for
the year in which the person was born.

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It will be
observed that one column is devoted to each month of the year. Take the
month in which the person was born, and follow down the column until
opposite the required date, the days, of the month being given in the
left-hand column. In this way one can ascertain the position of the moon
for any day throughout the year. To illustrate: If a person was born
March 21, 1820, by following down the column for March until opposite
the 21st day, we find the moon was in ♊ (Gemini). The innate quality or
function being ♈ (Aries), we thus learn that the person is polarized in
♊ (Gemini). Turn to the table of contents and find the page where "♈
(*Aries*) *with the Moon in* ♊ (*Gemini*)" is described. Having read
that, turn to the Ephemerides of the planets for the same year. But ere
explaining the method of finding the position of the planets, we will
add a few words to guard against any misunderstanding of the moon's
positions. The position of the signs in the upright columns indicates
the day the moon entered a given function or sign. The mark (“)
indicates that the moon continued in the sign given above until the next
following sign occurs: thus we find that the moon entered the sign ♊
(Gemini) March 19, and remained in that sign until March 22, against
which date we find the sign ♋ (Cancer); therefore March 21, 1820 the
moon was still in ♊, as indicated by the ditto mark (“).

#### TO FIND THE POSITION OF THE PLANETS.

Turning to the Ephemerides of the planets for the year 1820, we find the
three left-hand columns devoted

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

to ♅ (Uranus), with the character (♅), which stands for this planet, at
the head of the three columns. Against the date Jan. 1 we find the sign
♊ (Gemini), and the ditto mark (“) indicates that Uranus remained in
this sign throughout the entire year, as it takes this planet nearly
seven years to pass through one sign of the zodiac. Therefore March 21 ♅
(Uranus) was in ♊ (Gemini). The three adjoining columns to the right are
devoted to ♄ (Saturn), whose designating character (♄) is found at the
top of the column. Jan. 1 we find this planet was in ♎ (Libra); and as
the table shows that it remained in this sign throughout the year, it
was consequently in ♎ (Libra) March 21. Moving again to the right, we
find at the top of the next threefold column (♄), the character
representing Jupiter. Against Jan. 1 we find the sign ♌, (Leo), but
following down the column we find that Jupiter entered ♍, (Virgo) Feb.
22, and remained in that sign for the balance of the year; consequently
March 21 it was in ♍ (Virgo). Moving again to the right, we find the
character ♂ (Mars). By following down the column, we find that Jan. 26
Mars entered ♒ (Aquarius) and remained in that sign until April 2, when
it entered ♓ (Pisces); consequently March 21 it was still in ♒
(Aquarius). Following down the column devoted to ♀ (Venus), we find this
planet entered ♑ (Capricorn) March 18 and remained in that sign until
April 5, when it entered ♒ (Aquarius). Consequently March 21 it was in ♑
(Capricorn).

It will be observed that, as we approach the sun, the planets having
shorter orbits make their changes from sign to sign much more
frequently; so much so, that

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

when we come to Mercury, we require double space to give the numerous
changes it makes within a year's time. Commencing with January and
following down the column, we find March 20 that Mercury entered ♑
(Capricorn). The next change indicated was March 25, when it entered ♒
(Aquarius). Consequently we know that it was in ♑ March 21, which
completes the positions of the planets for a person of the date in
question; and the same method is pursued in finding their position at
any other date of this or other years, a three-line column or division
being devoted to each planet, with the appropriate planetary sign over
the same, save in the case of Mercury, whose changes are so frequent
that one column barely gives its positions for six months: so for the
balance of the year, follow down the last right-hand column, which is
the second or extra column that it has been necessary to devote to this
extremely lively planet, to enable us to tabulate all its changes.

In each of the three-line columns the first space is devoted to the
month, the second to the day of the month, and the third to the sign or
position of the planet at the specified time.

With a few experiments, the positions of the moon and planets can be
readily found, and in far less time than this detailed description
occupies. We give below, in tabulated form, the positions as found in
the above nativity, which will also serve as a suggestion of a condensed
method of expressing the facts of a nativity.

By consulting the Table of Contents, the significance of the above or
any other positions can be readily ascertained.

As the twelve tribes of Israel were each an expression of a distinct
sign of the zodiac, or twelve departments of the heavens, and as each
person in a general sense belongs to one of these tribes, we give below,
in tabulated form, the sign of each, and therefrom persons may determine
by the sign of their own nativity to which of the twelve tribes they
belong.
