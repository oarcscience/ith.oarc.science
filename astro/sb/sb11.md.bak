### CHAPTER VI.

#### THE TWELVE POLARITIES OF ARIES.

♈ (*Aries*), *with the Moon in* ♈ (*Aries*).

THIS polarity gives the moon in the life (that is, in conjunction with
the sun), and comes from the minds of the parents being quite satisfied,
active, and independent,—encompassed with their own sphere of thought.
This gives brilliancy of thought and mental characteristics. It is as if
the person were mentally independent of *all* other persons and drawing
all their intellectuality from the fountain-head. This gives a very
independent character, revolving within their own sphere, and
intensifies all the characteristics of Aries, except as it militates
against their inclination to go out into new and independent thought.
This polarity gives no additional liability to disease except in case of
loss of friends, property, or continued worriment; it would then have a
tendency to produce brain trouble, and sometimes insanity and sudden
stroke of paralysis.

♈ (*Aries*), *with the Moon in* ♉ (*Taurus*).

This nature comes from the minds of the parents being turned toward
nature in its interior and metaphysical phenomena, and especially in the
direction of the laws of life, health, and happiness. It leads Aries

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

into the realm of sense and nature, intensifying all the senses and
causing the person to live in and be governed largely by their
sensations, making them particularly acute and susceptible in the sense
of smell; also to the mental and physical conditions of others, to
wholesome or deleterious localities, and to proper and improper food. It
likewise gives them great discriminative powers as to the qualities and
conditions of things generally. It leads the mind to consider the laws
of health and to seek the causes of disease, etc., in the elements of
nature. Such persons make natural hygienic physicians. It gives them a
great deal of determination of character with a disposition to
leadership. It gives love of all the sciences relative to life, health,
and happiness; also, as a rule, great vitativeness and a love of large,
spacious rooms and richness and elegance of surroundings. It increases
the innate nature of Aries in its love of harmony and makes the person
exceedingly sensitive to the least discord of any kind.

It increases the liability to sick headache, nervous debility,
derangement of the digestive functions, and disinclination to give the
body sufficient nourishment. In case Jupiter is in Virgo, it will
reverse this and turn the inclination in the opposite direction; will
cause them to have an extra amount of vitality and too great inclination
to sex indulgence. Other planets would have effects corresponding to
their nature.

♈ (*Aries*), *with Moon in* ♊ (*Gemini*).

This polarity comes from the minds of the parents being interested in
educational and scientific directions.

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It gives to the
child good language and the desire to be a ready expresser of thought.
It intensifies the activity of the brain and body, and inclines the
person to their employment in the uses of life. It gives adaptation to
art and mechanical genius of the higher order, but causes the person to
be restless, fretful, and exacting in private life. Such persons are
constantly in danger of overdoing; they should cultivate the habit of
resting mind and body. This polarity gives Aries a tendency to
changefulness and to making the organ of continuity small, and sometimes
the organ of concentrativeness also.

Parents having children of this nativity should plan regular habits for
them. In the first place, they should see to it that they finish
whatever they begin; and that they have a regular rule of life,—a time
for work, a time for play, and a time for rest and quiet. It would be
well for persons of this nativity to make a practice of sitting in a
room alone an hour each day abstaining from thought, to the end of
developing a restful habit of mind and body. An important reason for
this is, that should such a person be attacked by disease, especially by
a fever, it would at once go to the brain, and intensify its activity
until insanity and even death might follow; whereas, if by practice they
had acquired the power to stop thinking at will, they could have
resisted the disease and saved themselves from insanity or death. Pain
is but a mental action in physical nature to call into activity the
power of the will to throw off the disease and to extricate the
poisonous elements. Therefore, when the mind is kept under the control
of the will, the disease can be expelled from the system.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

This polarity also intensifies the liability to nervous diseases,
throwing them especially into the limbs; more particularly so if the
body is very active.

♈ (*Aries*), *with the Moon in* ♋ (*Cancer*).

This nature comes from the minds of the parents being actively
interested in money matters and home affairs, which polarizes the mind
upon the questions of domestic and business life, and impresses them
with a great deal of responsibility and care relating to provision for
the future of self, home, and family. It gives a predisposition to
anxiety and worriment, especially if they are not successful in making
money. It also gives great sensitiveness to the inharmonious conditions
of other persons. It gives a clear, reasoning brain, and a nature
calculated to be governed by, and act from, the educational impetus
given their minds. Other things being favorable, it makes very good
teachers, and gives an innate love of science, especially science of the
mind. It adapts them better for writers than speakers; it indicates a
disposition to be at the head of, and to excel in, everything; it gives
the clearest logical and (for the time being) retentive brain of all the
144 polarities. They are liable to excesses in their sex inclinations
unless the mind is very active in other directions.

Children of this polarity should have special instruction in the uses
and abuses of their sex nature; they should also be guarded against
miserly habits.

This polarity likewise indicates liability to nervous exhaustion,
sick-headache, general debility of the system,

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

and, in cases of inharmonious marriage or business relations, a
liability to tumorous affections, and with mothers a tendency to
suppuration of the breast.

♈ (*Aries*), *with the Moon in* ♌ (*Leo*).

This nature comes from an over-zealousness in matters of religion and
philanthropy, and an active affectional nature.

Leo represents the heart, the love nature, and. this polarity turns the
mind into the interior life. These persons act from the heart, from
their love, and from, their intuitions. Their reasonings and intuitions
unite very harmoniously, which makes them superior persons; but their
minds are apt to be too much beyond their age for common usefulness.
They have a warm, sympathetic, love nature, and are very sensitive to a
cross word, to a frown, or even to a sober look, where they were
expecting one that was pleasing. They are deep and thoughtful, and
inclined to dwell in the unfathomable depths of mysterious causation;
but if, from whatever cause, they are restrained in this direction,
their mind turns to the business and phenomenal world, and they are
liable to become radical sceptics to everything but the world of sense.
They are kind-hearted. and loving companions, but are subject to
extremes and to peculiar and eccentric notions. They have orderly
brains, capable of comprehending and of obtaining a complete
understanding of almost anything that may be presented to them. They
have strong imaginations, can form and hold a picture in their mind of
an ideal thing very clearly and minutely,—almost as much so

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

as if they had made a draught of it and had it before their eyes. They
have strong spiritual inclinations, but their ideas in such matters are
usually original with themselves.

If such persons have inharmonious surroundings and difficulties in the
love life, it will produce the following effects: weak digestion,
weakness of the chest and lungs, pains across the region of the
diaphragm, dyspeptic difficulties, pains in the head, and great
despondency, also affecting the circulatory system, and giving liability
to paralysis. This can be largely avoided by deep, full breathing.

♈ (*Aries*), *with the Moon in* ♍ (*Virgo*).

This polarity results from scientific and mathematical tendencies on the
part of the parents; also from an active love of music.

Virgo being the great chemist of the human organism, gives a very
active, discriminative, criticising mind, and constant inclination
toward scientific thought, especially that of the exact sciences; and
these persons are therefore characterized by order, harmony, and method
in all their investigations, having clear, logical, and reasoning minds.
They can be led in almost any direction by superior logical reasonings,
but are inclined to scepticism in religious matters, and in all branches
of thought where abundant and conclusive evidences cannot be found. They
have a mind well adapted to teaching in all the branches of education
and science, in which they make great attainments. Their love for the
sciences, however, is apt to take them into too

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

many different branches. They have no inclination to work with their
hands at physical labor, but are wholly men and women of the brain, and
are very well adapted to literary pursuits, and are persistent in
whatever they undertake.

This nature is, however, usually lacking in the domestic qualities, and
care should be exercised in selecting companions that are mentally and
physically harmonious to them; as, for their success, they need a
companion who is a helper, but not a controller, as the slightest
disposition to control or dictate their course of action throws them
into confusion and impairs their efficiency and usefulness. They are apt
to be quite exacting, and even severe, in family matters, and are rather
intolerant of those not having like capacity with themselves.

This polarity also intensifies the Aries love of music, and makes then
exceedingly choice and discriminating as to its qualities. Their
vitativeness is usually large, with strong inclination to hygienic
habits.

♈ (*Aries*), *with the Moon in* ♎ (*Libra*).

This comes from a strong desire to penetrate into the interior of
things, and to discover causes. This is a condition of direct opposition
to the innate nature as an external reasoner, and therefore the
reasoning faculties are usually low; but, in place of them, they
generally have a better faculty, or means of guidance, viz., intuitional
reasoning. This makes the mind a little slow in comprehending the ideas
of others on their first presentation, and also in book-learning; but
whilst

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

ideas are not understood at the time, they are quite likely to come to
them clearly, and in their proper shape, afterwards. They are very
correct in business decisions in general. As counsellors, their judgment
is superior because they are careful and very accurate in their
conclusions. This nativity makes persons slow to speak, careful in what
they say, very honorable in their dealings, just and equitable in all
their proceedings; and such persons are good advisers of the people. As
judiciary officials, they justly inspire confidence, and an even and
uniform success usually marks their career through life. They possess a
good degree of originality of thought, accompanied by a due degree of
conventionality. They are best adapted to living in a small town or
city, where they can grow up with the place, and thus be known and
appreciated, and have their talents made available to the community.
This nature should have a good general education.

As to a profession, other things being favorable, they would be well
adapted to real estate, law practice, and, as judges, they would be very
just. They are not liable to go to extremes in anything. Children of
this nativity should have a great deal of indulgence by the parents.
Harsh or positive rule would be injurious to them, and liable to do more
harm than good. Kindness and reason is all that is necessary for their
guidance.

It gives a strong conjugal and domestic love nature, with large
inhabitiveness. They are liable to indigestion, weakness of chest,
lungs, general nervousness, and sometimes difficulties of kidneys and
reins. If they are given to the use of stimulants or narcotics[,
they](errata.htm#4.md)

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

will be subject to tremor of voice and limbs. They should by all means
avoid stimulants and narcotics, and be careful about their diet.

♈ (*Aries*), *with the Moon in* ♏ (*Scorpio*).

This results from the minds of the parents being under the control of
the passional nature, and in a combative attitude with the affairs of
life. It gives to the child a tendency to follow the regular rules and
customs of society, and of the world in general, and an inclination to
classical education. It inclines the mind more to conventionalities than
to origination. It gives a positiveness to the character, with high
temper and combativeness; also an inclination to jealousy of a
companion, with strong passions, and frequently weakness and
excitability, and sometimes promiscuity in the sex life. It usually
leaves the faculties of Aries to act themselves out, with the exception
that it diminishes its love and warmth of sympathy and kindness, and
increases its passion and magnetic heat. Frequently such persons are
lascivious, and, if Jupiter is in. Virgo, epicureans. This polarity
turns the mind into the physical, and leaves it to be guided and
controlled by the positions of the planets. It increases the liability
to paralysis, especially of the heart and intestines.

♈ (*Aries*), *with the Moon in* ♐ (*Sagittarius*).

This nature comes from great activity and hurry in the executive sphere.
It gives marked activity of mind and body,—with constant liability to
extremes

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

in everything these persons undertake,—with restlessness, anxiety, and
overdoing, which frequently impairs. their health. This polarity makes
them hasty in their action and speech; it unites the mental with the
physical activities.

Such persons should think well before they speak or act, and study to be
more deliberative and calculating, and to avoid hurry and bustle. They
have a natural inclination to public speaking, and have usually good
language, but too concentrated and pointed to give forth a lucid
expression. The front brain is usually narrow. They are liable to make
many mistakes in life by not properly considering the consequences of
their acts, and to make many enemies by thoughtless speaking. It is hard
for them to keep a secret, and there is danger of their being
imaginative, and of exaggeration. Children of this nativity need a very
careful tuition in reason and logic. They should be taught to always
look for the cause and effect of everything. Such children ought not to
be physically punished other than by allowing them to reap the
consequences of their own acts. It is always a good plan to take them at
their own words and act upon what they say, without regard to what they
mean; and especially when such acts would bring about that which the
child did not want. This would give them an experimental knowledge of
the consequences of an imperfect or too hasty expression of immature
thoughts, which is a remarkable tendency of this character; thus, by
giving them the practical experience while they are young, parents can
save their children many thousands of dollars, and from many serious
mistakes which would

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

otherwise follow them through life. This nativity also gives persons
liabilities to excesses in their sex inclinations, and a disposition on
the part of children to self-abuse; conjugality is also with this
polarity on a lower plane, even though their love may be devoted to one.
They should have careful and thorough instruction in the consequences of
the abuse of the sex function. These children should have all the
education they are capable of receiving, unless planetary conditions
indicate a life of physical labor, which would only be the case if Venus
and Mercury were in Capricorn or Gemini. Aries polarized in Sagittarius
gives fine musical qualities.

It gives liability to sciatica, and difficulty of the motor nerves, and
sometimes weakens the circulatory system.

♈ (*Aries*), *with the Moon in* ♑ (*Capricorn*).

This comes from the minds of the parents being actively engaged in
business plans. It turns the attention of the mind towards the general
uses of humanity, or business planning. These persons are very positive,
active, and determined, and liable to extremes in business directions.
It is frequently the case that they have prolific imaginations, with
many ideas and plans and methods of obtaining money. They have a great
love of popularity and good standing in society. Frequently they are
quite exacting with employees, and persistent, although not apt to be
extreme or unreasonable. They are fond of society, mainly that of a
popular character. They are adapted

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

to political interests and legal professions, and have great respect for
men of letters, and for education in general. Have a special adaptation
to music as a profession, and some fitness for all branches of pursuit
characterized under the life of Capricorn.

This polarity intensifies the liability which Aries has to brain
difficulty, and some tendency to weakness of lower limbs and joints, and
affections of the nerves. It may be noticed by such persons that if they
take stimulants or narcotics, it affects the joints and knees first.

♈ (*Aries*), *with the Moon in* ♒ (*Aquarius*).

Here the minds of the parents were interested in making public
attainments. This directs the mind toward and adapts it for dealings and
associations with the many. Such persons are very easy to get acquainted
with; and, in fact, they don't feel as if they needed any prior
introduction. In many cases they feel as familiar with a stranger as
with one whom they have known for years. They are affable and pleasing
in their manners, and attractive in general. Persons born in this
polarity love to entertain people, by the hour with their pleasing talk
and winning planners, and they are apt to have considerable power in
this respect. If there are strong business endowments, it makes them
very successful in whatever business they may undertake. If Mars should
be in Capricorn, it would make of them model teachers. Whatever sphere
of usefulness they enter should be in connection with the many, for
their leading characteristics adapt them for such a sphere. If inclined
to literary pursuits, they

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

would be very clear and explicit, and, with good endowments, would be
very popular. They could be successful in mercantile pursuits.

This polarity gives some liability to rheumatic troubles and affections
of the sensatory nerves.

♈ (*Aries*), *with the Moon in* ♓ (*Pisces*).

Here is indicated a restless, studious condition of the minds of the
parents. This gives great inclination to study and to get knowledge of
mysterious things. It gives a tendency to works of philanthropy, but it
always produces a restless, worrisome inclination, and a constant
feeling of dissatisfaction. Such persons always feel that their pathway
is a rough one, and as if numerous obstacles were constantly in their
way. This arises, however, from their own peculiar inclinations and
mental conditions. Such persons are apt to have a great deal of
unpleasantness in married life. Frequently it will be found that in the
left hand, and sometimes in both hands, there is a line, or numerous
small lines, running parallel with the line that goes round the thumb,
and on the side next to it (the thumb), called in Chiromancy the life
line. This in the left hand indicates difficulties in the love life, and
in the right hand difficulties and obstacles in the business life, and
its extent will be indicated by the length and strength of the lines
found there.

They usually have a good degree of mechanical power and some tendency
towards manufacturing interests. This nativity gives the persons order
and harmony of thought, and makes them logical in their

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

reasonings. It causes them to be too much affected by the actions of
others, and leaves their business inclinations wholly dependent on the
planetary conditions, except so far as it gives them a strong studious
inclination. It gives them some tendency to inconstancy in the love
life, especially if inharmony exists between them and their consort.

This polarity increases the tendency to nervousness and general debility
and affections of the head.
