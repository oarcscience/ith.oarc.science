### CHAPTER XI.

#### THE TWELVE POLARITIES OF VIRGO.

♍ (*Virgo*), *with the Moon in* ♈ (*Aries*).

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> nature comes from a strong
determination on the part of the parents, and endows the child with
mental strength, firmness, and stability; but the activity and strength
of will is apt to weaken the digestive power, and turn the intensity of
their nature to the brain.

This intensifies the strongest sense of Virgo,—the power of sight,—and,
unless the person uses great care, the eyes may be weakened by over-use.

Such persons are apt to succeed in intellectual pursuits, but are too
stubborn for their own good. They have a keen sense of order and
harmony, and are disturbed by disorderly surroundings. They also have a
lively sense of the ridiculous, especially when mirthfulness is active.
They incline to be the head and front of whatever they engage in. It
intensifies the liabilities, of the Virgo nature to disease, with
inclination towards the brain.

♍ (*Virgo*), *with the Moon in* ♉ (*Taurus*).

This polarity indicates that the parents had a clear, well-balanced
condition relative to the inner and outer nature, and gives to the child
fine intuitions in the care of the body and the culture of the mind; so
that such

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

persons act from the higher intuitional faculties in all the affairs of
their life. It gives keen perceptions of the unspoken thoughts and
intents of others, and insight relative to the future of business
transactions; and such persons are scarcely ever deceived or surprised
by results. They are frequently too active for their own good, as their
energies exceed their endurance; yet their keen perception of the laws
of hygiene are such that they have great tenacity to life and power of
endurance. This is the strongest business character in the entire list
of all the polarities.

This greatly lessens the liability to disease in the Virgo nature, but
gives some tendency to diseases pertaining to the lymphatic system.

♍ (*Virgo*), *with the Moon in* ♊ (*Gemini*).

This nature indicates that the parents had a great admiration of
eloquent language, which gives the child a very active mind and a
talkative disposition, with uncommon readiness in the use of words, yet
a liability of being too rapid in speech, which may result in
stammering, stopping, etc. They are inclined to be artistic, and to love
the beautiful, with aptness for education, and some desire for public
life. They also have good mechanical ability.

Are inclined to have nervous difficulties, from too intense activity;
also to be fastidious.

♍ (*Virgo*), *with the Moon in* ♋ (*Cancer*).

This polarity results from the parents’ high ideal of a beautiful home
and domestic surroundings, and produces

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

in the child a love of beauty, grandeur, and elegance in domestic life,
and a strong love of a home surrounded by pure nature, thus making
harmony an absolute necessity of their being. They are so sensitive to
inharmonious conditions that it takes but little to unnerve them and
make them sick, from discordant surroundings. They have pictured in
their imaginations an ideal world so far excelling this, that it is hard
for them to endure present environments. They are disposed to be
economical and industrious, and rather over-anxious concerning those
dependent upon them, and about laying up for the future. Are very kind
to their own, but their love and sympathy being controlled by the
natural instincts or common mother nature, they are apt to be extremely
selfish and exclusive in this direction; but their love of family may be
greatly extended or enlarged by favoring conditions, and find expression
in a humanitarian feeling.

♍ (*Virgo*), *with the Moon in* ♌ (*Leo*).

This nature arises from a strong but purely natural sex love on the part
of the father, or most positive parent, and creates in the child a
disposition to act from the natural instincts expressed through the
emotion of love and the sensational nature. Such persons have a strong,
deep, and insatiable love passion, which is apt to control all their
thoughts and actions; though they are not apt to be licentious, yet
their love may be turned readily from one to another, and when it is, it
brings into subordination all the other functions of mind and body. A
lady of our acquaintance (in this polarity),

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

married, and, after living with her husband two or three years, fell in
love with another man, and begged and implored of her husband to grant
her a divorce, which he did; and as soon as she had married the other,
she was sorry, and more anxious than before to break the bond, and
return to her former allegiance.

To these persons love is a strong, restless, ideal passion, which
creates a constant desire for some unattainable condition; they should
realize that the trouble is mainly in their own unbalanced love nature,
and discipline themselves to make the most of life as they find it, and
not be so anxious to jump, so to speak, "from the frying-pan into the
fire."

This polarity gives increased liability to affections of the nervous
system, making the nerves highly sensitive. Mothers, while nursing, are
apt to have considerable trouble with their breasts.

♍ (*Virgo*), *with the Moon in* ♍ (*Virgo*).

This nature is produced by a restful, harmonious, and satisfied love
condition on the part of the parents. It gives the child great love of
harmony and nature; powerful love and sex endowments, great purity and
self-control in sex matters, and uncommon faithfulness. Their vitality
frequently exceeds their own needs or ability to use, and they are
natural sustainers and [suppliers](errata.htm#7.md) of vitality to those
with whom they are intimately related. Apart from their great devotion
in love, they are independent and self-reliant characters.

They have insight amounting often to the gift of foreknowledge, and
frequently thoughts come to them,

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

like audible words, imparting knowledge of what is to come. Their
organic qualities, as a rule, are very fine. This polarity intensifies
the keen sensibilities of Virgo. To such persons, surroundings of
beauty, harmony, and love are indispensable. It makes them polite, gives
love of refinement, tendency to art, admiration for persons of
distinction and for those who dress distinctly different from others,
provided there is an air of superiority accompanying them.

They are more fine and delicate in their taste, touch, and general
habits than others, and have a natural dread of anything irregular,
coarse, or obscene.

This polarity leaves the diseases of the Virgo nature to act itself out
according to circumstances.

♍ (*Virgo*), *with the Moon in* ♎ (*Libra*).

This nature comes from the continual use of the perceptive faculties, on
the part of the parents, both as to present conditions and future
results, and endows the child with great abilities in this direction,
and such an one in the medical profession would make the highest
possible attainments if guided by their own innate powers of perception.

They are very mature spirits, and act more from the spiritual than from
the material plane of life. They are usually free from sensationalism,
solid and philosophical in their reasonings, independent in thought, and
are often writers on philosophical and scientific subjects.

They have strong sexual powers, which, if perverted, bring ruinous
results, but if controlled, give a good,

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

strong physical body and fine intuitions; but if planetary conditions
are such as to greatly intensify activity, there is danger of early
disease of the nerves of the eye, and even blindness, especially if the
business demands upon the eye call it excessively into use.

Such persons are rapid readers, quick and intuitive in learning; but on
arriving at maturity they will not study anything minutely, but glance
over, and catch general ideas of books on philosophy, science, and
nature, and afterwards formulate their own ideas. They are not disposed
to be attentive listeners to sermons and lectures, but intuitively catch
the thought and utilize it as their own. Are not inclined to run after
new things, but are satisfied with the ever new in nature that is
constantly revealing itself to their own understanding.

These persons may have spinal trouble and irritation or weakness of the
reproductive organs.

♍ (*Virgo*), *with the Moon in* ♏ (*Scorpio*).

This comes from the parents’ appreciation of literary thought and regard
for men in positions of honor, with aspiration for similar positions and
attainments themselves. This nature becomes incarnated in the child, and
gathers additional strength from selfishness, imitation,
conventionality, and persistence in their own chosen course in life.
They are too careless of the feelings of their immediate associates.
They incline to social life and rather prefer the society of their own
sex; lack sympathy, and even care, in the domestic sphere; are
high-tempered, and even vindictive. It is

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

especially necessary to their success that such persons have the most
complete education.

This polarity hardens the sensitive points in the Virgo nature, and on
the whole is favorable to success in life.

It gives them some tendency to heart disease and liability to neuralgic
pains.

♍ (*Virgo*), *with the Moon in* ♐ (*Sagittarius*).

This comes from a vigorous, healthy condition and strong, active
executive powers on the part of the parents, and endows the child with
an exceedingly quick and active body and mind, and an intensity of power
unequalled in any other polarity. They concentrate all their powers of
body and mind upon whatever they decide to do, and often push it forward
to an extreme far beyond reason; in fact, these persons are only
susceptible to the reason of others when they are exhausted, unless
planets give modification. They have great love of the executive, and
delight in physical and mental activity, and would soon sicken and die
if forced to be inactive.

They are apt to be bossy, and to speak more harshly than they mean. We
might almost suppose they spoke and then thought afterwards, and often
cause offence, when not intended, by their hasty speech.

They love to come before the public with their mental and physical
abilities, and are often teachers of the laws of hygiene, and mental and
moral philosophy, teaching from their intuitions rather than from their
classical knowledge. Their extremely active executive

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

mind is apt to characterize whatever they do, and they often jump at
conclusions, being so quick and impulsive in their nature as to lead
them to seek results by the shortest of possible methods.

This polarity gives a tendency to religious and spiritual thought. It
increases the liability to diseases of the digestive organs, and gives
some tendency to sciatica and nerve difficulties in general.

♍ (*Virgo*), *with the Moon in* ♑ (*Capricorn*).

This nature arises from the parents’ love of business attainments and
financial proficiency, or love of and attention to music, art, or
pursuit of public honors. It gives the child fine business
qualifications and musical talents; makes a thorough practical mind,
fond of business, society, music, and public entertainments; inclines to
late suppers and general gratification of the senses. It is not easy for
such to recognize the necessity of restraining their feelings or
moderating their habits.

They are apt to generalize rather than enter into minutiæ; are very
independent in character, opposed to restraint or control in any
direction. They lack domestic qualifications and only have regard for
them from necessity; but it should be remembered that planetary
conditions may so change this as to make it scarcely perceptible, save
as they may observe it in their own interior impulses.

They lack conjugality, yet love to have a home, and require that it
shall be fine and elegant. Desire to be recognized in that home as
sovereign, being served by

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

others, and demanding obedience, comfort, beauty, elegance, and art.

This polarity increases the liability of the digestive. organs to
disease.

♍ (*Virgo*), *with the Moon in* ♒ (*Aquarius*).

This polarity arises from a state of mental exhilaration on the part of
the parents over successful efforts at pleasing associates or the
public. It gives the child mental and physical harmony, love of society,
order, etc., which qualities if turned into a business direction would
give them superior tact and adaptability to please, and well fit them
for trade or mechanical and musical pursuits, in which they would be
likely to excel.

Their minds and bodies are active and intellects. bright, and they have
much control over persons with whom they associate. They are inclined to
politics, but have little discrimination between friends and strangers.

They have fair love of home, a wide range of business talent, and are
best adapted to city life.

The polarity gives liability to nervousness, also to, rheumatism.

♍ (*Virgo*), *with the Moon in* ♓ (*Pisces*).

This arises from the parents’ attraction to, and enjoyment of,
persistent application to some technical or detailed pursuit, and
produces in the child a close, practical business mind, good mechanical
ability, industry, adaptation to literary pursuits, and a desire to

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

obtain and utilize knowledge in various ways, but mainly in the
every-day uses of life: it gives some restlessness and a love of
variety. This polarity is apt to produce a dissatisfied feeling in the
married life, making them restless and irritable at home, which arises
from the existence of an ideal not formulated or easily attained if it
was.

They will love power and personal respect, and be sensitive to blame.
When planetary conditions are unfavorable, their restlessness induces
desire for travel.

This polarity has a tendency to increase Virgo's liability to diseases
of the head and lower limbs.
