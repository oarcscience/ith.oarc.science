### CHAPTER XX.

#### THE TWELVE POSITIONS OF VENUS.

♀ (*Venus*)*: its Function*.

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> planet embodies the nature of pure
conjugal love. It has in its composition the elements of beauty,
elegance, faithfulness, and devotion. It is in the function of the pure
and divine instincts, and these ennobling qualities are contributed in
degree according to the receptivity of the function of the body in which
the planet is found. Venus serves faithfully whatever sign or function
she is united to; so if the planet is in an educational or business
department, she gives her power and energy to those pursuits, even to
leaving the conjugal and domestic sphere to the sway of other planetary
influences; her nature being that of love, she is readily turned into
the service of dominant functions, and therefore even unites in
strengthening and intensifying the passions if they are controlling
forces. Venus is therefore a choice gift, and, like riches and many
other blessings of life, proves a benefit or injury according to the use
one makes of it.

Venus is accountable for many marriages through the natural attraction,
produced from its presence in signs corresponding to those in which
persons of the opposite sex were born, as illustrated in Mercury, as its
influence on the love nature causes an appreciation and

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

love for the corresponding principle in others. These marriages are more
apt to be harmonious than those caused by the attractions of any other
planet.

♀ (*Venus*) *in* ♈ (*Aries*).

This position of Venus contributes ideality, and gives a high ideal of
the love life, but frequently produces a dreamy mental state, tending
away from practical, everyday life. Their ideal is so exquisite that it
frequently causes disappointment and unhappiness in marriage. It
intensifies conjugality, but such persons frequently live a single life
from inability to find a companion who meets their ideal requirements.
It contributes to the mental qualifications requisite to proficiency in
music, art, poetry, novel-writing, etc.; but adaptation to such pursuits
will be mainly determined by other planetary positions.

♀ (*Venus*) *in* ♉ (*Taurus*).

This position of Venus idealizes the mind in all matters pertaining to
the sensations and affections, frequently giving strong, ardent love;
but, having its origin in the sensational nature, it is not always
enduring, especially when the person is born in a sign or function
lacking constancy. It gives a keen sense of pain and pleasure, and, if
abnormal conditions exist in the nature of the person, it is apt to
create morbid fancies of derangement and disease. It gives strong likes
and dislikes; also a love of nature, with a disposition to the study of
its phenomena and adaptation to agricultural thought and life.

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

♀ (*Venus*) *in* ♊ (*Gemini*).

This position gives great love of study, scientific and scholastic, and
tendencies toward materialism. It qualifies such persons for teachers,
and sometimes speakers. It turns the love away from the domestic and
sexual nature into the intellectual and educational spheres.

♀ (*Venus*) *in* ♋ (*Cancer*).

This concentrates the love nature upon home, family, and children, and
is apt to unite its forces with Mars and create an excessive love of
home and family. It intensifies the sensitiveness of the innate nature,
and is apt to give an intense love for children generally, and all the
characteristics given under the sign Cancer.

♀ (*Venus*) *in* ♌ (*Leo*).

This gives the most intense conjugal love, without any direct alliance
to mere sex passion. It gives a very strong, ardent, emotional, and even
zealous nature, and imparts love of beauty, harmony, and refinement to
the spontaneous love attributes; but we must remember that all these
good qualities may be inverted by inharmonious conditions or by the
natural inclinations of a person. To illustrate, one possessing these
choice qualities may meet obstacles and evil and treachery in so many
ways, that the law of self-preservation would assert itself, and convert
these finer and nobler qualities into their direct opposites; in which
case, the greater the prior good, the more conspicuous would the evil
appear.

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

♀ (*Venus*) *in* ♍ (*Virgo*).

In this position Venus is at home, where her nature finds its most
harmonious expression and imparts all its beautiful characteristics to
the soul and intuitive nature. She gives faithfulness in love, kindness,
sympathy, and devotion in all the affections, uniting them in harmonious
expression, and giving intuitive knowledge of the uses and abuses of the
sex and love nature. She strengthens and harmonizes the digestive organs
and functions, giving a fine, harmonious, and symmetrical physique; but
as this position is in the intuitive function, she may come under the
influence of the passional nature, when her beautiful qualities may be
led captive to the lower sensual principles.

♀ (*Venus*) *in* ♎ (*Libra*).

This gives a strong love of sex indulgence, very fine intuitions, ripens
the intellect, and forms a harmonious link between the intuitions and
reasoning faculties, unless its powers are unduly turned in sex
directions. It strengthens the generative function, increases ideality
and love of beauty; but if other conditions incline toward sensuality,
it will add its power in that direction.

♀ (*Venus*) *in* ♏ (*Scorpio*).

This contributes its influence to the sex function, and its powers are
absorbed therein and its high qualities inverted, unless other powers
are sufficiently strong to control. It leaves the nature devoid of
conjugality in the finer and higher sense of the term. It is apt to
increase hardness, self-will, and combativeness. This

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

position of Venus reduces the love nature to a mere animal instinct;
therefore under this condition we may not expect to find very loving or
harmonious companions. The position may be somewhat counterbalanced in
other directions, so as to present the phase of a strong sex love,
purifying the ideas concerning sex relations, yet the position is more
apt to give weakness than strength to the body.

♀ (*Venus*) *in* ♐ (*Sagittarius*).

This gives a strong, active, and expressive love nature; a love of
activity; harmony and grace in movement; love of the beautiful and
artistic; and disposition to express love by service to the loved one:
it enhances chastity, and greatly increases conjugality; it gives a love
for the invisible, and for the interior sciences and spiritual
philosophies.

♀ (*Venus*) *in* ♑ (*Capricorn*).

This gives love of business, more than of home and family, or conjugal
relations.

It is advisable for persons not to marry under these circumstances,
unless other planetary conditions assist in creating true conjugal and
domestic inclinations. It then gives power and tenacity for maintenance
of home and family. Such persons’ minds are apt to be all absorbed in
general business ideas. It adds, however, to the love of music, art, and
the beautiful in general.

♀ (*Venus*) *in* ♒ (*Aquarius*).

This turns the love nature into the sphere of the public, giving love of
public life, being with crowds,

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

and dealing with the many; it inclines one to the theatre, and other
places of amusement, and turns the love nature away from home and family
relations; it adapts one for trade or travel where they will meet the
public.

If other things contribute towards sexual indulgence or abuses, it will
then give its whole power in that direction; but if ordinary chastity is
maintained, it will add suavity, inclination to fashionable dress,
approbativeness and conservativeness, and a great deal of tact in
dealing with strangers.

It adds harmony to the motor nerves; gives fine mechanical intuitions;
love of music, with ability to compose and perform the same; and also
adds somewhat to the love of nature.

♀ (*Venus*) *in* ♓ (*Pisces*).

This gives a love of walking and of physical exercise; a love of study
and of knowledge; and sometimes it takes the form of an uneasy, restless
desire for something, or to go somewhere, which they cannot explain,
even to themselves; and creates uneasiness and dissatisfaction in
married life. Where this effect is dominant, it is always seen in the
lines of the hand. The line partially surrounding the thumb will have a
parallel line on the side next the thumb, but more frequently, numerous
small lines will be seen running parallel with this line (which is
called the life-line). Where this is seen, we may safely say that there
is, or will be, a dissatisfied or confused state existing in the marital
relations. Sometimes, however, these lines are produced by other
combinations, and the single line expresses a

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

single obstacle or barrier in the way of their carrying out their will
or inclinations.

Where there is a single parallel line, it indicates that a person will
live an inner and an outer life,—one for the public and one for
themselves. The length of the line around the thumb indicates the length
of the life. If the parallel line runs half-way, beginning at the end
next the forefinger, then this obstacle will continue till about half
the life is past: thus the length of the parallel line indicates the
length of time this obstacle will continue, whether it be a quarter,
half, three-quarters, or the whole life. It also indicates at what time
of life it will begin, and at what time it will end, by its relative
position to the beginning or end of the life-line.

Venus’ position in Pisces frequently produces nervousness and dyspeptic
difficulties when the innate nature is of a nervous temperament. If the
innate function is Aries, it will be productive of nervous headaches and
restless anxiety. If in Gemini, it would be a restless, general
nervousness. If in Cancer, it would be apt to create tumors and
inflammation of the bowels. If in Virgo, dyspeptic difficulties, and
sometimes nervous affections of the eyes. If in Libra, some liability to
kidney difficulty; and if a female, affections of the womb and pains
across the small of the back. In Sagittarius, it would produce general
nervous derangement of the liver and all the internal organs. These
derangements do not always occur under these conditions; but where there
are extreme difficulties in the family and love life, such effects will
be consequent. If Mercury and Venus are both in Pisces, it will occasion
dissatisfaction and desire to travel.
