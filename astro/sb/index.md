The next time someone asks you "what's your sign" as an icebreaker,
remember Mr. Hiram E. Butler. Hiram Butler put forward a radically
simplified version of astrology during the 19th century. Up until then,
astrologers had laboriously plotted out the configuration of the
planets, including exact angles between planets, houses (which are
specific to a geographic location and time), ascending nodes, descending
nodes, rising signs, and so on. And this is still what a professional
astrologer will base his or her advice on. Whether or not you believe,
one has to admit that this not the easiest method of divination ever
invented. One can't just learn this on a whim.

However, the vernacular astrology, with everyone divided into twelve
pigeonholes based on their natal sun sign, can be traced back to Mr.
Butler, and particularly this book, Solar Biology. Butler actually
divided everyone into *144* pigeonholes, based on their natal sun and
moon signs. The planets are also used, but only the sign they occupy is
important; the angles between them are ignored. This makes it easy to
create a horoscope, as the time and place of birth are no longer
required. The tricky computation of the rising signs and houses is
skipped. You just look up the positions in any ephemeris, then read the
matching page in this book. The result is a system so simple,
practically anyone can do it.

Although not well known today, Butler is the missing link in the chain
from Ptolemy's [Tetrabiblos](../ptb/index) to the astrology column in
the back of your daily paper.

The original book used was bound with an ephemeris for 1820 to 1900
which was impossible to OCR, and is omitted from this text. You can use
the [Planetary Positions](../../time/cal/astro) page at this site to
obtain the same information for an arbitrary date.--*J.B. Hare*, March
