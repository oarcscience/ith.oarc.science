### IV. THE HARE IN THE MOON.

When the moon is waxing, from about the eighth day to the full, it
requires no very vivid imagination to descry on the westward side of the
lunar disk a large patch very strikingly resembling a rabbit or hare.
The oriental noticing this figure, his poetical fancy developed the
myth-making faculty, which in process of time elaborated the legend of
the hare in the moon, which has left its marks in every quarter of the
globe. In Asia it is indigenous, and is an article of religious belief.
"To the common people in India the spots look like a hare, *i.e.*
Chandras, the god of the moon, carries a hare (sasa), hence the moon is
called Sasin or Sasanka, hare mark or spot." <span
id="fr_75"></span>[75](ml21.htm#fn_77.md) "Max Müller also writes, "As a
curious coincidence it may be mentioned that in Sanskrit the moon is
called Sasānka, *i.e.* 'having the marks of a hare,' the black marks in
the moon being taken for the likeness of the hare." <span
id="fr_76"></span>[76](ml21.htm#fn_78.md) This allusion to the sacred
language of the Hindus affords a convenient opportunity of introducing
one of the most beautiful legends of the East. It is a Buddhist tract;
but in the lesson which it embodies it will compare very favourably with
many a tract more ostensibly Christian.

"In former days, a hare, a monkey, a coot, and a fox, became hermits,
and lived in a wilderness together, after having sworn not to kill any
living thing. The god Sakkria having seen this through his divine

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

power, thought to try their faith, and accordingly took upon him the
form of a brahmin, and appearing before the monkey begged of him alms,
who immediately brought to him a bunch of mangoes, and presented it to
him. The pretended brahmin, having left the monkey, went to the coot and
made the same request, who presented him a row of fish which he had just
found on the bank of a river, evidently forgotten by a fisherman. The
brahmin then went to the fox, who immediately went in search of food,
and soon returned with a pot of milk and a dried liguan, which he had
found in a plain, where apparently they had been left by a herdsman. The
brahmin at last went to the hare and begged alms of him. The hare said,
'Friend, I eat nothing but grass, which I think is of no use to you.'
Then the pretended brahmin replied, 'Why, friend, if you are a true
hermit, you can give me your own flesh in hope of future happiness.' The
hare directly consented to it, and said to the supposed brahmin, 'I have
granted your request, and you may do whatever you please with me.' The
brahmin then replied, 'Since you are willing to grant my request, I will
kindle a fire at the foot of the rock, from which you may jump into the
fire, which will save me the trouble of killing you and dressing your
flesh.' The hare readily agreed to it, and jumped from the top of the
rock into the fire which the supposed brahmin had kindled; but before he
reached the fire, it was extinguished; and the brahmin appearing in his
natural shape of the god Sakkria, took

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

the hare in his arms and immediately drew its figure in the moon, in
order that every living thing of every part of the world might see
it." <span id="fr_77"></span>[77](ml21.htm#fn_79.md) All will acknowledge
that this is a very beautiful allegory. How many in England, as well as
in Ceylon, are described by the monkey, the coot, and the fox--willing
to bring their God any oblation which costs them nothing; but how few
are like the hare--ready to present themselves as a living sacrifice, to
be consumed as a burnt offering in the Divine service! Those, however,
who lose their lives in such self-sacrifice, shall find them, and be
caught up to "shine as the brightness of the firmament and as the stars
for ever and ever."

Another version of this legend is slightly variant. Grimm says: "The
people of Ceylon relate as follows: While Buddha the great god sojourned
upon earth as a hermit, he one day lost his way in a wood. He had
wandered long, when a *hare* accosted him: 'Cannot I help thee? Strike
into the path on thy right. I will guide thee out of the wilderness.'
Buddha replied: 'Thank thee, but I am poor and hungry, and unable to
repay thy kindness.' 'If thou art hungry,' said the hare, 'light a fire,
and kill, roast, and eat me.' Buddha made a fire, and the hare
immediately jumped in. Then did Buddha manifest his divine power; he
snatched the beast out of the flames, and set him in the moon, where he
may be seen to this day." <span id="fr_78"></span>[78](ml21.htm#fn_80.md)
Francis Douce, the antiquary, relates this myth, and adds, "this is from
the information

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

of a learned and intelligent French gentleman recently arrived from
Ceylon, who adds that the Cingalese would often request of him to permit
them to look for the hare through his telescope, and exclaim in raptures
that they saw it. It is remarkable that the Chinese represent the moon
by a rabbit pounding rice in a mortar. Their mythological moon Jut-ho is
figured by a beautiful young woman with a double sphere behind her head,
and a rabbit at her feet. The period of this animal's gestation is
thirty days; may it not therefore typify the moon's revolution round the
earth." <span id="fr_79"></span>[79](ml21.htm#fn_81.md)

<span id="img_06300"></span> ![SÂKYAMUNI AS A HARE IN THE
MOON.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Collin de Plancy's&lt;/i&gt;
''&lt;i&gt;Dictionnaire Infernal&lt;/i&gt;.''](img/06300.jpg.md)  
SÂKYAMUNI AS A HARE IN THE MOON.  
*Collin de Plancy's* ''*Dictionnaire Infernal*.''

In this same apologue we have doubtless a duplicate, the original or a
copy, of another Buddhist legend found among the Kalmucks of Tartary; in
which Sâkyamuni himself, in an early stage of existence, had inhabited
the body of a hare. Giving himself as

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

food to feed the hunger of a starving creature, he was immediately
placed in the moon, where he is still to be seen. <span
id="fr_80"></span>[80](ml21.htm#fn_82.md)

The Mongolian also sees a hare in the lunar shadows. We are told by a
Chinese scholar that "tradition earlier than the period of the Han
dynasty asserted that a hare inhabited the surface of the moon, and
later Taoist fable depicted this animal, called the gemmeous hare, as
the servitor of the genii, who employ it in pounding the drugs which
compose the elixir of life. The connection established in Chinese legend
between the hare and the moon is probably traceable to an Indian
original. In Sanskrit inscriptions the moon is called Sason, from a
fancied resemblance of its spots to a leveret; and pandits, to whom maps
of the moon's service have been shown, have fixed on *Loca Paludosa*,
and *Mons Porphyrites* or *Keplerus* and *Aristarchus*, for the spots
which they think exhibit the similitude of a hare." <span
id="fr_81"></span>[81](ml21.htm#fn_83.md) On another page of the same work
we read: "During the T'ang dynasty it was recounted that a cassia tree
grows in the moon, this notion being derived apparently from an Indian
source. The *sal* tree (*shorea robusta*), one of the sacred trees of
the Buddhists, was said during the Sung dynasty to be identical with the
cassia tree in the moon. The lunar hare is said to squat at the foot of
the cassia tree, pounding its drugs for the genii. The cassia tree in
the moon is said to be especially visible at mid-autumn, and hence to
take a degree at the examinations which are held at this

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

period is described as plucking a leaf from the cassia." <span
id="fr_82"></span>[82](ml21.htm#fn_84.md)

This hare myth, attended with the usual transformation, has travelled to
the Hottentots of South Africa. The fable which follows is entitled
"From an original manuscript in English, by Mr. John Priestly, in Sir G.
Grey's library." "The moon, on one occasion, sent the hare to the earth
to inform men that as she (the moon) died away and rose again, so
mankind should die and rise again. Instead, however, of delivering this
message as given, the hare, either out of forgetfulness or malice, told
mankind that as the moon rose and died away, so man should die and rise
no more. The hare, having returned to the moon, was questioned as to the
message delivered, and the moon, having heard the true state of the
case, became so enraged with him that she took up a hatchet to split his
head; falling short, however, of that, the hatchet fell upon the upper
lip of the hare, and cut it severely. Hence it is that we see the
'hare-lip.' The hare, being duly incensed at having received such
treatment, raised his claws, and scratched the moon's face; and the dark
parts which we now see on the surface of the moon are the scars which
she received on that occasion." <span
id="fr_83"></span>[83](ml21.htm#fn_85.md) In an account of the Hottentot
myth of the "Origin of Death," the angered moon heats a stone and burns
the hare's mouth, causing the hare-lip. <span
id="fr_84"></span>[84](ml21.htm#fn_86.md) Dr. Marshall may tell us, with
all the authority of an eminent physiologist, that hare-lip is
occasioned by an arrest

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

in the development of certain frontal and nasal processes, <span
id="fr_85"></span>[85](ml21.htm#fn_87.md) and we may receive his
explanation as a sweetly simple solution of the question; but who that
suffers from this leporine-labial deformity would not prefer a
supernatural to a natural cause? Better far that the lip should be cleft
by Shakespeare's "foul fiend Flibbertigibbet," than that an abnormal
condition should be accounted for by science, or comprised within the
reign of physical law.

Even Europe is somewhat hare-brained: for Cæsar tells us that the
Britons did not regard it lawful to eat the hare, though he does not say
why; and in Swabia still, children are forbidden to make shadows on the
wall to represent the sacred hare of the moon.

We may pursue this matter even in Mexico, whose deities and myths a
recent Hibbert lecturer brought into clearer light, showing that the
Mexicans "possessed beliefs, institutions, and a developed mythology
which would bear comparison with anything known to antiquity in the old
world." <span id="fr_86"></span>[86](ml21.htm#fn_88.md) The Tezcucans, as
they are usually called, are described by Prescott as "a nation of the
same great family with the Aztecs, whom they rivalled in power, and
surpassed in intellectual culture and the arts of social
refinement." <span id="fr_87"></span>[87](ml21.htm#fn_89.md) Their account
of the creation is that "the sun and moon came out equally bright, but
this not seeming good to the gods, one of them took a rabbit by the
heels and slung it into the face of the moon, dimming its lustre with a
blotch, whose mark may be seen to this day." <span
id="fr_88"></span>[88](ml21.htm#fn_90.md)

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

We have now seen that the fancy of a hare in the moon is universal; but
not so much importance is to be attached to this, as to some other
aspects of moon mythology. The hare-like patch is visible in every land,
and suggested the animal to all observers. That the rabbit's period of
gestation is thirty days is a singular coincidence; but that is
all--nay, it is not even that, for "the moon's revolution round the
earth," which Douce supposed the Chinese myth to typify, is accomplished
in a little more than *twenty-seven* days. Neither is much weight due to
the fanciful comparison of Gubernatis: "The moon is the watcher of the
sky, that is to say, she sleeps with her eyes open; so also does the
hare, whence the *somnus leporinus* became a proverb." <span
id="fr_89"></span>[89](ml21.htm#fn_91.md) The same author says on another
page, and here we follow him: "The mythical hare is undoubtedly the
moon. In the first story of the third book of the *Pancatantram*, the
hares dwell upon the shore of the lake Candrasaras, or lake of the moon,
and their king has for his palace the lunar disk." <span
id="fr_90"></span>[90](ml21.htm#fn_92.md) It is this story, which Mr.
Baring-Gould relates in outline; and which we are compelled still
further to condense. In a certain forest there once lived a herd of
elephants. Long drought having dried up the lakes and swamps, an
exploring party was sent out in search of a fresh supply of water. An
extensive lake was discovered, called the moon lake. The elephants with
their king eagerly marched to the spot, and found their thirsty hopes
fully realized. All round the lake were in

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

numerable hare warrens, which the tread of the mighty monsters crushed
unmercifully, maiming and mangling the helpless inhabitants. When the
elephants had withdrawn, the poor hares met together in terrible plight,
to consult upon the course which they should take when their enemies
returned. One wise hare undertook the task of driving the ponderous herd
away. This he did by going alone to the elephant king, and representing
himself as the hare which lived in the moon. He stated that he was
deputed by his excellency the moon to say that if the elephants came any
more to the lake, the beams of night would be withheld, and their bodies
would be burned up with perpetual sunshine. The king of the elephants
thinking that "the better part of valour is discretion," decided to
offer an apology for his offence. He was conducted to the lake, where
the moon was reflected in the water, apparently meditating his revenge.
The elephant thrust his proboscis into the lake, which disturbed the
reflection. Whereupon the elephant, judging the moon to be enraged,
hurried with his apology, and then went off vowing never to return. The
wise hare had proven that "wisdom is better than strength"; and the
hares suffered no more molestation. "We may also remark, in this event,
the truth of that saying of Euripides, 'that one wise counsel is better
than the strength of many'" (*Polybius*, i. 35).
