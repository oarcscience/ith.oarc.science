### V. THE TOAD IN THE MOON.

We owe an immense debt of gratitude and honour to the many enterprising
and cultivated men who have gone into all parts of the earth and among
all peoples to investigate human history and habit, mythology and
religion, and thus enrich the stores of our national literature. With
such a host of travellers gathering up the fragments, nothing of value
is likely to be lost. We have to thank intelligent explorers for all we
know of the mythical frog or toad in the moon: an addition to our
information which is not unworthy of thoughtful notice.

The Selish race of North-west American Indians, who inhabit the country
between the Cascade and Rocky Mountains, have a tradition, which Captain
Wilson relates as follows: "The expression of 'a toad in the moon,'
equivalent to our 'man in the moon,' is explained by a very pretty story
relating how the little wolf, being desperately in love with the toad,
went a-wooing one night and prayed that the moon might shine brightly on
his adventure; his prayer was granted, and by the clear light of a full
moon he was pursuing the toad, and had nearly caught her, when, as a
last chance of escape, she made a desperate spring on to the face of the
moon, where she remains to this day." <span

Cowichan tribes think that the moon has a frog in it." <span

Eastern world, and in China find the frog in the moon. "The famous
astronomer Chang Hêng was avowedly a disciple of Indian teachers. The
statement given by Chang Hêng is to the effect that 'How I, the fabled
inventor of arrows in the days of Yao and Shun, <span
id="fr_93"></span>[\*70](#fn_1.md) obtained the drug of immortality from Si
Wang Mu (the fairy 'Royal Mother' of the West); and Chang Ngo (his wife)
having stolen it, fled to the moon, and became the
frog--*Chang-chu*--which is seen there.' The lady *Chang-ngo* is still
pointed out among the shadows in the surface of the Moon." <span
id="fr_94"></span>[93](ml21.htm#fn_95.md) Dr. Wells Williams also tells us
that in China "the sun is symbolized by the figure of a raven in a
circle, and the moon by a rabbit on his hind legs pounding rice in a
mortar, or by a three-legged toad. The last refers to the legend of an
ancient beauty, Chang-ngo, who drank the liquor of immortality, and
straightway ascended to the moon, where she was transformed into a toad,
still to be traced in its face. It is a special object of worship in
autumn, and moon cakes dedicated to it are sold at this season." <span
id="fr_95"></span>[94](ml21.htm#fn_96.md) We have little doubt that what
the Chinese look for they see. We in the West characterize and colour
objects which we behold, as we see them through the painted windows of
our predisposition or prejudice. As a great novelist writes: "From the
same object different

<span id="fn_1"></span>[\*70](#fr_93.md) Mr. Herbert A. Giles says that How
I was a legendary chieftain, who "flourished about 2,500 B.C." *Strange
Stories from a Chinese Studio*, London, 1880, i. 19, *note*.

conclusions are drawn; the most common externals of nature, the wind and
the wave, the stars and the heavens, the very earth on which we tread,
never excite in different bosoms the same ideas; and it is from our own
hearts, and not from an outward source, that we draw the hues which
colour the web of our existence. It is true, answered Clarence. You
remember that in two specks of the moon the enamoured maiden perceived
two unfortunate lovers, while the ambitious curate conjectured that they
were the spires of a cathedral." <span
id="fr_96"></span>[95](ml21.htm#fn_97.md) Besides, it must be confessed
that the particular moon-patch that has awakened so much interest in
every age and nation is quite as much like a frog or toad as it is like
a rabbit or hare.
