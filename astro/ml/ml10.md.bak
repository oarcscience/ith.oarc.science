### VI. OTHER MOON MYTHS.

It is almost time that we should leave this lunar zoology; we will
therefore merely present a few creatures which may be of service in a
comparative anatomy of the whole subject, and then close the account.
There is a story told in the Fiji Islands which so nearly approaches the
Hottentot legend of the hare, that they both seem but variations of a
common original. In the one case the opponent of the moon's benevolent
purpose affecting man's hereafter was a hare, in the other a rat. The
story thus runs: There was "a contest between two gods

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

as to how man should die. Ra Vula (the moon) contended that man should
be like himself--disappear awhile, and then live again. Ra Kalavo (the
rat) would not listen to this kind proposal, but said, 'Let man die as a
rat dies.' And he prevailed." <span
id="fr_97"></span>[96](ml21.htm#fn_98.md) Mr. Tylor, who quotes this rat
story, adds: "The dates of the versions seem to show that the presence
of these myths among the Hottentots and Fijians, at the two opposite
sides of the globe, is at any rate not due to transmission in modern
times." <span id="fr_98"></span>[97](ml21.htm#fn_99.md)

From the rat to one of its mortal enemies is an easy transition. The
Australian story is that Mityan, the moon, was a native cat, who fell in
love with another's wife, and while trying to induce her to run away
with him, was discovered by the husband, when a fight took place. Mityan
was beaten and ran away, and has been wandering ever since. <span
id="fr_99"></span>[98](ml21.htm#fn_100.md) We are indebted for another
suggestion to Bishop Wilkins, who wrote over two centuries ago: "As for
the form of those spots, *Albertus* thinks that it represents a lion,
with his tail towards the east, and his head the west; and some others
have thought it to be very much like a fox, and certainly 'tis as much
like a lion as that in the *zodiac*, or as *ursa major* is like a
bear." <span id="fr_100"></span>[99](ml21.htm#fn_101.md) This last remark
of the old mathematician is "a hit, a very palpable hit," at those
unpoetical people who catalogue the constellations under all sorts of
living creatures' names, implying resemblances, and then "sap with
solemn sneer" our myths of the moon.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

We have now seen that the moon is populated with men, women, and
children,--hares and rabbits, toads and frogs, cats and dogs, and sundry
small "cattle"; we observe in making our exit that it is also planted
with a variety of trees; in short, is a zoological garden of a high
order. Even among the ancients some said the lunar spots were forests
where Diana hunted, and that the bright patches were plains. Captain
Cook tells us that in the South Pacific "the spots observed in the moon
are supposed to be groves of a sort of trees which once grew in
Otaheite, and, being destroyed by some accident, their seeds were
carried up thither by doves, where they now flourish." <span
id="fr_101"></span>[100](ml21.htm#fn_102.md) Ellis also tells of these
Tahitians that "their ideas of the moon, which they called *avae* or
*marama*, were as fabulous as those they entertained of the sun. Some
supposed the moon was the wife of the sun; others that it was a
beautiful country in which the aoa grew." <span
id="fr_102"></span>[101](ml21.htm#fn_103.md) These arborary fancies derive
additional interest, if not a species of verisimilitude, from the record
of a missionary that "a stately tree, clothed with dark shining leaves,
and loaded with many hundreds of large green or yellowish-coloured
fruit, is one of the most splendid and beautiful objects to be met with
among the rich and diversified scenery of a Tahitian landscape."

Our collection of lunar legends is now on exhibition. No thoughtful
person will be likely to dispute the dictum of Sir John Lubbock
that<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

"traditions and myths are of great importance, and indirectly throw much
light on the condition of man in ancient times." <span
id="fr_103"></span>[102](ml21.htm#fn_104.md) But they serve far more
purposes than this. They are the raw material, out of which many of our
goodly garments of modern science and religion are made up. The
illiterate negroes on the cotton plantation, and the rude hunters in the
jungle or seal fishery, produce the staple, or procure the skins, which
after long labour afford comfort and adornment to proud philosophers and
peers. The golden cross on the saintly bosom and the glittering crown on
the sovereign brow were embedded as rough ore in primeval rocks ages
before their wearers were born to boast of them. We shall esteem our
treasures none the less because their origin is known, as we love "the
Best of men" none the less because he was born of a woman. We closed our
series of moon myths with a vision of a beautiful country, ornamented
with groves of fruitful trees, whose seeds had been carried thither by
white-winged doves; and carried thither because "some accident" had
destroyed the trees in their native isles on earth. Thus the lunar world
had become a desirable scene of superior and surpassing loveliness. Who
can reflect upon this dream of human childhood, and not recall some
dreams of later years? Who can fail to discern slight touches of the
same hand which we see displayed in other designs? "Happily for historic
truth," says Mr. Tylor, "mythic tradition tells its tales without
expurgating the

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

episodes which betray its real character to more critical
observation." <span id="fr_104"></span>[103](ml21.htm#fn_105.md) Who is not
led on from Tahiti to Greece, and to the Isles of the Blessed, the
Elysium which abounds in every charm of life, and to the garden of the
Hesperides, with its apples of gold; thence to the Meru of the Hindoos,
the sacred mountain which is perpetually clothed in the rays of the sun,
and adorned with every variety of plants and trees; thence again to the
Heden of the Persians, of matchless beauty, where ever flourishes the
tree Hom with its wonderful fruit; on to the Chinese garden, near the
gate of heaven, whose noblest spring is the fountain of life, and whose
delightful trees bear fruits which preserve and prolong the existence of
man? <span id="fr_105"></span>[104](ml21.htm#fn_106.md) Thence an easy
entrance is gained to the Hebrew Paradise, with its abounding trees
"pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the
midst of the garden"; and finally arises a sight of the "better land" of
the Christian poetess, the incorruptible and undefiled inheritance of
the Christian preacher, the prospect which is "ever vernal and
blooming,--and, best of all, amid those trees of life there lurks no
serpent to destroy,--the country, through whose vast region we shall
traverse with untired footsteps, while every fresh revelation of beauty
will augment our knowledge, and holiness, and joy." <span
id="fr_106"></span>[105](ml21.htm#fn_107.md) Who will travel on such a
pilgrimage of enlarged thought, and not come to the conclusion that if
one course of development has been followed by all scientific and
spiritual truth, then<span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span>

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

"almost the whole of the mythology and theology of civilized nations
maybe traced, without arrangement or co-ordination, and in forms that
are undeveloped and original rather than degenerate, in the traditions
and ideas of savages"? <span id="fr_107"></span>[106](ml21.htm#fn_108.md)
Such a conclusion may diminish our self-esteem, if we have supposed
ourselves the sole depositaries of Divine knowledge; but it will exalt
our conception of the generosity of the Father of all men, who never
left a human soul without a witness of His invisible presence and
ineffable love.
