The Mirror of Pythagoras

Vide p. 147.

"In laying thus the blame upon the moone,  
Thou imitat'st subtill *Pythagoras*,  
Who, what he would the people should beleeve,  
The same be wrote with blood upon a glasse,  
And turn'd it opposite 'gainst the new moone  
Whose beames reflecting on it with full force,  
Shew'd all those lynes, to them that stood behinde,  
Most playnly writ in circle of the moone;  
And then he said, Not I, but the new moone  
Fair *Cynthia*, perswades you this and that."

Testament*. Written by Thomas Nash. London, 1600.

 

The East Coast of Greenland.

Vide p. 171.

"When an eclipse of the moon takes place, they attribute it to the
moon's going into their houses, and peeping into every nook and corner,
in search of skins and eatables, and on such occasions accordingly, they
conceal all they can, and make as much noise as possible, in order to
frighten away their unbidden guest."--*Narrative of an Expedition to the
East Coast of Greenland*: Capt. W. A. Graah, of the Danish Roy. Navy.
London, 1837, p. 124.

Lord Iddesleigh on the Moon.

Vide p. 189.

Speaking at a political meeting in Aberdeen, on the 22nd of September,
1885, the Earl of Iddesleigh approved the superannuated notion of lunar
influence, and likened the leading opponents of his party to the old and
new moon. "What signs of bad weather are there which sometimes you
notice when storms are coming on? It always seems to me that the worst
sign of bad weather is when you see what is called the new moon with the
old moon in its arms. I have no doubt that many of you Aberdeen men have
read the fine old ballad of Sir Patrick Spens, who was drowned some
twenty or thirty miles off the coast of Aberdeen. In that ballad he was
cautioned not to go to sea, because his faithful and weatherwise
attendant had noticed the new moon with the old moon in its lap. I think
myself that that is a very dangerous sign, and when I see Mr.
Chamberlain, the new moon, with Mr. Gladstone, the old one, in his arms,
I think it is time to look out for squally weather."--*The Standard*,
London, Sept. 23rd, 1885.

The Scottish ballad of Sir Patrick Spens, which is given in the
collections of Thomas Percy, Sir Walter Scott, William Motherwell, and
others, is supposed by Scott to refer to a voyage that may really have
taken place for the purpose of bringing back the Maid of Norway,
Margaret, daughter of Alexander III., to her own kingdom of Scotland.
Finlay regards it as of more modern date. Chambers suspects Lady Wardlaw
of the authorship. While William Allingham counsels his readers to cease
troubling themselves with the historical connection of this and all
other ballads, and to enjoy rather than investigate. Coleridge calls Sir
Patrick Spens a "grand old ballad."

 

Greeting the New Moon in Fiji.

Vide p. 212.

"There is, I find, in Colo ('the devil's country' as it is called), in
the mountainous interior of Viti Levu, the largest island of Fiji, a
very curious method of greeting the new moon,

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

that may not, as few Europeans have visited this wild part, have been
noticed. The native, on seeing the thin crescent rise above the hills,
salutes it with a prolonged 'Ah!' at the same time quickly tapping his
open mouth with his hand, thus producing a rapid vibratory sound. I
inquired of a chief in the town the meaning and origin of this custom,
and my interpreter told me that he said, 'We always look and hunt for
the moon in the sky, and when it comes we do so to show our pleasure at
finding it again. I don't know the meaning of it; our fathers always did
so.'"--Alfred St. Johnston, in *Notes and Queries* for July 23rd, 1881,
p. 67. See also Mr. St. Johnston's *Camping Among Cannibals*, London,
1883, p. 283.

 

Lunar Influence on Dreams.

Vide p. 214.

Arnason says that in Iceland "there are great differences between a
dream dreamt in a crescent moon, and one dreamt when the moon is waning.
Dreams that are dreamt before full moon are but a short while in coming
true; those dreamt later take a longer time for their
fulfilment."--*Icelandic Legends*, Introductory Essay, p. lxxxvii.
