# PREFACE

THIS work is a contribution to light literature, and to the literature
of light. Though a monograph, it is also a medley.

The first part is mythological and mirthsome. It is the original nucleus
around which the other parts have gathered. Some years since, the writer
was led to investigate the world-wide myth of the Man in the Moon, in
its legendary and ludicrous aspects; and one study being a
stepping-stone to another, the ball was enlarged as it rolled.

The second part, dealing with moon-worship, is designed to show that
anthropomorphism and sexuality have been the principal factors in that
idolatry which in all ages has paid homage to the hosts of heaven, as
*heaved* above the aspiring worshipper. Man adores what he regards as
higher than he. And if the moon is supposed to affect his tides, that
body becomes his water-god.

The third part treats of lunar superstitions, many of which yet live in
the vagaries which sour and shade our modern sweetness and light.

The fourth and final part is a literary essay on lunar inhabitation,
presenting *in nuce* the present state of the enigma of "the plurality
of worlds."

Of the imperfections of his production the author is partly conscious.
Not *wholly* so; for others see us often more advantageously than we see
ourselves. But a hope is cherished that this work--a compendium of lunar
literature in its least scientific branches--may win a welcome which
shall constitute the worker's richest reward. To the innumerable writers
who are quoted, the indebtedness felt is inexpressible.
