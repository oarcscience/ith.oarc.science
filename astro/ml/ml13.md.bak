### III. THE MOON A WORLD-WIDE DEITY.

Anthropomorphism, or the representation of outward objects in the *form*
of *man*, wrought largely, as we have seen, in the manufacture of the
man in the moon; it entered no less into the composition of the
moon-god. The twenty-first verse of the fiftieth Psalm contains its
recognition and rebuke. "Thou

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

thoughtest that I was altogether as thyself"; or, still more literally,
"Thou hast thought that being, I shall be like thee." As Dr. Delitzsch
says, "Because man in God's likeness has a bodily form, some have
presumed to infer backwards therefrom that God also has a bodily form
like to man, which is related by way of prototype to the human
form." <span id="fr_126"></span>[125](ml21.htm#fn_127.md) As well might we
say that because a watchmaker constructs a chronometer with a movement
somewhat like that of his own heart, therefore he is mechanical,
metallic, and round. Against this anthropomorphic materialism science
lifts up its voice; for what modern philosopher, worthy of the name,
fails to distinguish between phenomenon and fact, inert matter and
active force? Says a recent writer, "We infer that as our own master of
the mint is neither a sovereign nor a half-sovereign, so the force which
coins and recoins this ὑλη, or matter, must be altogether in the
god-part and none of it in the metal or paste in which it works." <span
id="fr_127"></span>[126](ml21.htm#fn_128.md) With the progress of man's
intelligence we shall observe improvement in this anthropomorphism, but
it will still survive. As Mr. Baring-Gould tells us: "The savage invests
God with bodily attributes; in a more civilized state man withdraws the
bodily attributes, but imposes the limitations of his own mental nature;
and in his philosophic elevation he recognises in God intelligence only,
though still with anthropomorphic conditions." <span
id="fr_128"></span>[127](ml21.htm#fn_129.md)

Xenophanes said that if horses, oxen, and lions could paint, they would
make gods like themselves.<span class="contnote">\[paragraph

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

And Ralph Waldo Emerson says: "The gods of fable are the shining moments
of great men. We run all our vessels into one mould. Our colossal
theologies of Judaism, Christism, Buddhism, Mahometism, are the
necessary and structural action of the human mind. The student of
history is like a man going into a warehouse to buy clothes or carpets.
He fancies he has a new article. If he go to the factory, he shall find
that his new stuff still repeats the scrolls and rosettes which are
found on the interior walls of the pyramids of Thebes. Our theism is the
purification of the human mind. Man can paint, or make, or think nothing
but man. He believes that the great material elements had their origin
from his thought. And our philosophy finds one essence collected or
distributed." <span id="fr_129"></span>[128](ml21.htm#fn_130.md) And a
devout author, whose orthodoxy--whatever that may mean--is unquestioned,
acknowledges that man adored the unknown power in the sun, and "in the
moon, which bathes the night with its serene splendours. Under this
latter form, completed by a very simple anthropomorphism which applies
to the gods the law of the sexes, the religions of nature weighed during
long ages upon Western Asia." <span
id="fr_130"></span>[129](ml21.htm#fn_131.md) A volume might be written upon
this subject; but we have other work in hand.

It seems to be generally admitted that no form of idolatry is older than
the worship of the moon. Lord Kames says, "It is probable that the sun
and moon were early held to be deities, and that they were the

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

first visible objects of worship." <span
id="fr_131"></span>[130](ml21.htm#fn_132.md) Dr. Inman says, "That the sun
and moon were at a very early period worshipped, none who has studied
antiquity can deny." <span id="fr_132"></span>[131](ml21.htm#fn_133.md) And
Goldziher maintains that "the lunar worship is older than the
solar." <span id="fr_133"></span>[132](ml21.htm#fn_134.md) Maimonides, "the
light of Israel," says that the Zabaists not only worshipped the moon
themselves, but they also asserted that Adam led mankind to that species
of worship. No doubt luniolatry is as old as the human race. In some
parts the moon is still the superior god. Mr. Tylor writes: "Moon
worship, naturally ranking below sun worship in importance, ranges
through nearly the same district of culture. There are remarkable cases
in which the moon is recognised as a great deity by tribes who take less
account, or none at all, of the sun. An old account of the Caribs
describes them as esteeming the moon more than the sun, and at new moon
coming out of their houses crying, Behold the moon!" <span
id="fr_134"></span>[133](ml21.htm#fn_135.md) This deity, then, is ancient
and modern: also a chief of the gods: let us now show that he is a god
whose empire is the world.

We begin in Asia, and with the Assyrian monuments, which display many
religious types and emblems. "Representations of the heavenly bodies, as
sacred symbols, are of constant occurrence in the most ancient
sculptures. In the bas-reliefs we find figures of the sun, moon, and
stars, suspended round the neck of the king when engaged in the
performance of religious ceremonies." <span
id="fr_135"></span>[134](ml21.htm#fn_136.md) In Chaldæa "the moon

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

was named Sin and Hur. Hurki, Hur, and Ur was the chief place of his
worship, for the satellite was then considered as being masculine. The
name for the moon in Armenian was *Khaldi*, which has been considered by
some to be the origin of the word Chaldee, as signifying moon
worshippers." <span id="fr_136"></span>[135](ml21.htm#fn_137.md) With this
Chaldæan deity may be connected "the Akkadian moon god, who corresponds
with the Semitic Sin," and who "is Aku, 'the seated-father,' as chief
supporter of kosmic order, styled 'the maker of brightness,' En-zuna,
'the lord of growth,' and Idu, 'the measuring lord,' the Aïdês of
Hesychios." <span id="fr_137"></span>[136](ml21.htm#fn_138.md)

"With respect to the name of Chaldæan, perhaps the most probable account
of the origin of the word is, that it designates properly the
inhabitants of the ancient capital, Ur or Hur,--*Kkaldi* being in the
Burbur dialect the exact equivalent of *Hur*, which was the proper name
of the moon god, and Chaldæans being thus either 'moon worshippers,' or
simply, inhabitants of the town dedicated to, and called after, the
moon." <span id="fr_138"></span>[137](ml21.htm#fn_139.md) Again: "The first
god of the second triad is Sin or Hurki, the moon deity. It is in
condescension to Greek notions that Berosus inverts the true Chaldæan
order, and places the sun before the moon in his enumeration of the
heavenly bodies. Chaldæan mythology gives a very decided preference to
the lesser luminary, perhaps because the nights are more pleasant than
the clays in hot countries. With respect to the names of the god, we may
observe that Sin, the Assyrian or Semitic term, is a word of quite

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

uncertain etymology, which, however, is found applied to the moon in
many Semitic languages."  <span
id="fr_139"></span>[138](ml21.htm#fn_140.md) "*Sin* is used for the moon in
Mendæan and Syriac at the present day. It is the name given to the moon
god in St. James of Seruj's list of the idols of Harran; and it was the
term used for Monday by the Sabæans as late as the ninth century." <span
id="fr_140"></span>[139](ml21.htm#fn_141.md) Another author writes: "The
Babylonian and Assyrian moon god is Sin, whose name probably appears in
Sinai. The expression, 'from the origin of the god Sin,' was used by the
Assyrians to mark remote antiquity; because, as chaos preceded order, so
night preceded day, and the enthronement of the moon as the night-king
marks the commencement of the annals of kosmic order." <span
id="fr_141"></span>[140](ml21.htm#fn_142.md)

When we search the Hebrew Scriptures, we find too many allusions to the
Queen of Heaven, to Astarte and the groves, for us to doubt that the
Israelites adored

"--moonèd Ashtaroth,  
Heaven's queen and mother both." (Milton's *Odes*.)

Dr. Goldziher is an incontestable authority, and thus writes: "Queen or
Princess of Heaven is a very frequent name for the moon." <span
id="fr_142"></span>[141](ml21.htm#fn_143.md) Again, "Even in the latest
times the Hebrews called the moon the 'Queen of Heaven' (Jer. vii. 18),
and paid her Divine honours in this character at the time of the
captivity." <span id="fr_143"></span>[142](ml21.htm#fn_144.md) And, to
complete this author's witness, he again says: "What was the antiquity
of this lunar worship among

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

the Hebrews, is testified (as has long been known) by the part played by
Mount Sinai in the history of Hebrew religion. For this geographical
name is doubtless related to *Sin*, one of the Semitic names of the
moon. The mountain must in ancient times have been consecrated to the
moon. The beginning of the Hebrew religion, which was connected with the
phenomena of the night-sky, germinated first during the residence in
Egypt on the foundation of an ancient myth. The recollection of this
occasioned them to call the part of Egypt which they had long inhabited,
eres Sînîm, 'moonland' (Isa. xlix. 12)." <span
id="fr_144"></span>[143](ml21.htm#fn_145.md) It is but just that we should
hear the other side, when there is a difference of opinion. The above
mentioned 'Queen of Heaven' is beyond question the Ashtoreth or Astarte
(identical with our *star*), which was the principal goddess of the
Phœnicians; and we believe she was originally the goddess of the moon.
This is doubted by a modern writer, who says, "Baal is constantly
coupled with Astarte; and the more philosophical opinion is that this
national god and goddess were the lord and lady of Phœnicia, rather than
the sun and moon: for to a people full of political life the sun and
moon would have been themselves representatives, while a Divine king and
queen were the realities. And if so, the habitual inclination of the
Israelites, an essentially political people, for this worship becomes
the more easily understood." <span
id="fr_145"></span>[144](ml21.htm#fn_146.md) Professor F. D. Maurice, in
his *Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy*, also takes this view. The

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

question here is not whether the Jews worshipped Astarte, but whether
Astarte was the moon. This we cannot hesitate to answer in the
affirmative. Kenrick writes: "Ashtoreth or Astarte appears physically to
represent the moon. She was the chief local deity of Sidon; but her
worship must have been extensively diffused, not only in Palestine, but
in the countries east of the Jordan, as we find Ashtaroth-Karnaim
(Ashtaroth of two horns) mentioned in the book of Genesis (xiv. 5). This
goddess, like other lunar deities, appears to have been symbolized by a
heifer, or a figure with a heifer's head, whose horns resembled the
crescent moon. The children of Israel renounced her worship at the
persuasion of Samuel; and we do not read again of her idolatry till the
reign of Solomon (1 Kings xi. 5), after which it appears never to have
been permanently banished, though put down for a time by Josiah (2 Kings
xxiii. 13). She is the Queen of Heaven, to whom, according to the
reproaches of Jeremiah (vii. 18, xliv. 25), the women of Israel poured
out their drink-offerings, and burnt incense, and offered cakes,
regarding her as the author of their national prosperity. This epithet
accords well with the supposition that she represented the moon, as some
ancient authors inform us." <span
id="fr_146"></span>[145](ml21.htm#fn_147.md) Dr. Gotch, an eminent Hebrew
scholar, says that there is no doubt that the moon is the symbol of
productive power and must be identified with Astarte. "That this goddess
was so typified can scarcely be doubted. The ancient name of the city,
Ashtaroth-Karnaim, already referred

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

to, seems to indicate a horned Astarte, that is an image with a crescent
moon on her head like the Egyptian Athor. At any rate, it is certain
that she was by some ancient writers identified with the moon, as Lucian
and Herodian. On these grounds Movers, Winer, Keil, and others maintain
that originally Ashtoreth was the moon goddess." <span
id="fr_147"></span>[146](ml21.htm#fn_148.md) Clearly, then, the Hebrews
worshipped the moon. But, even apart from Astarte, this worship may be
proven on other evidence. Dr. Jamieson says that the word *mena* (moon:
Anglo-Saxon, *mona*) "approaches most nearly to a word used by the
prophet Isaiah, which has been understood by the most learned
interpreters as denoting the moon. 'Ye are they that prepare a table for
*Gad*, and that furnish the offering unto *Meni*' (Isa. lxv. 11). As
*Gad* is understood of the *sun*, we learn from Diodor. Sicul. that
*Meni* is to be viewed as a designation of the *moon*." <span
id="fr_148"></span>[147](ml21.htm#fn_149.md) This is Bishop Lowth's view.
"The disquisitions and conjectures of the learned concerning Gad and
Meni are infinite and uncertain: perhaps the most probable may be, that
Gad means good fortune, and Meni the moon." <span
id="fr_149"></span>[148](ml21.htm#fn_150.md) One point is worthy of notice.
In our English version *Meni* is rendered "number"; and we know very
well that by the courses of the moon ancient months and years were
numbered. In Isaiah iii. 18 we find the daughters of Zion ornamented
with feet-rings, and networks, and *crescents*: or, as our translation
reads, "round tires like the moon." And, once more, in Ezekiel xlvi., we
read that the gate of the inner court

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

of the sanctuary that "looketh toward the east, shall be opened on the
day of the new moon"; and the meat offering on "the day of the new moon
shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram." If
there was no sacred significance in the observance of these lunar
changes, why did the writer of the New Testament Epistle to the
Colossians say, "Let no man judge you in respect of the new moon"? A
competent scholar, in recognising this consociation of Hebrew religion
with the moon's phases, rightly ascribes to it an earlier origin. Says
Ewald: "To connect the annual festivals with the full moon, and to
commence them in the evening, as though greeting her with a glad shout,
was certainly a primitive custom, both among other races and in the
circle of nations from which in the earliest times Israel sprang." <span
id="fr_150"></span>[149](ml21.htm#fn_151.md) And the Bishop of Derry
remarks: "To a religious Hebrew it was rather the moon than the sun
which marked the seasons, as the calendar of the Church was regulated by
it." <span id="fr_151"></span>[150](ml21.htm#fn_152.md) We have sought to
place this Hebrew luniolatry beyond dispute, because so many Christians
have supposed that "the chosen people" lived in unclouded light, and
"the uncovenanted heathen" in outer and utter darkness.

Passing on we find that "in Pontus and Phrygia were temples to *Meen*,
and Homer says *Meen* presides over the months, whilst in the Sanskrit
*Mina*, we see her connected with the Fish and Virgin. It is not
improbable that the great Akaimenian

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

race, as worshipping and upholding sun and moon faiths, were called
after *Meni*, the moon." <span id="fr_152"></span>[151](ml21.htm#fn_153.md)
Among the Arabians the moon was the great divinity, as may be learned
from Pocock's *Specimen Historiæ Arabum*; Prideaux's *Connection*;
Gibbon's *Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire*; and Sale's *Preliminary
Discourse* to his translation of the *Koran*. Tiele says: "The ancient
religion of the Arabs rises little higher than animistic polydæmonism.
The names Itah and Shamsh, the sun god, occur among all the Semitic
peoples; Allât, or Alilât, and Al-Uzza, as well as the triad of moon
goddesses to which these last belong, are common to several, and the
deities which bear them are reckoned among the chief." <span
id="fr_153"></span>[152](ml21.htm#fn_154.md) The Saracens called the moon
*Cabar*, the great; and its crescent is the religious symbol of the
Turks to this day. Tradition says that "Philip, the father of Alexander,
meeting with great difficulties in the siege of Byzantium, set the
workmen to undermine the walls, but a crescent moon discovered the
design, which miscarried; consequently the Byzantines erected a statue
to Diana, and the crescent became the symbol of the state." Dr. Brewer,
who cites this story, adds: "Another legend is that Othman, the sultan,
saw in a vision a crescent moon, which kept increasing till its horns
extended from east to west, and he adopted the crescent of his dream for
his standard, adding the motto, *Donec repleat orbem*." <span
id="fr_154"></span>[153](ml21.htm#fn_155.md) Schlegel mentions the story
that Mahomet "wished to pass with his disciples as a

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

person transfigured in a supernatural light, and that the credulity of
his followers saw the moon, or the moon's light, descend upon him,
pierce his garments, and replenish him. That veneration for the moon
which still forms a national or rather religious characteristic of the
Mahometans, may perhaps have its foundation in the elder superstition,
or pagan idolatry of the Arabs." <span
id="fr_155"></span>[154](ml21.htm#fn_156.md) No doubt this last sentence
contains the true elucidation of the crescent. For astrolatry lives in
the east still. The *Koran* may expressly forbid the practice, saying:
"Bend not in adoration to the sun or moon"; <span
id="fr_156"></span>[155](ml21.htm#fn_157.md) yet, "monotheist as he is, the
Moslem still claps his hands at sight of the new moon, and says a
prayer." <span id="fr_157"></span>[156](ml21.htm#fn_158.md)

We come next to the Persians, whom Herodotus accuses of adoring the sun
and moon. But, as Gibbon says, "the Persians of every age have denied
the charge, and explained the equivocal conduct, which might appear to
give colour to it." <span id="fr_158"></span>[157](ml21.htm#fn_159.md) It
will certainly require considerable explanation to free from lunar
idolatry the following passage, which we find in the *Zend Avesta*: "We
sacrifice unto the new moon, the holy and master of holiness: we
sacrifice unto the full moon, the holy and master of holiness." <span
id="fr_159"></span>[158](ml21.htm#fn_160.md) Unquestionably the Persian
recognised the Lord of Light *in* the ordinances of heaven; and
therefore his was superior to many forms of blind idol-worship. So far
we may accept Hegel's interpretation of the *Zend* doctrine. "Light is
the *body of Ormuzd*; thence the worship of fire, because Ormuzd is
present

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

in all light; but he is not the sun or moon itself In these the Persians
venerate only the light, which is Ormuzd." <span
id="fr_160"></span>[159](ml21.htm#fn_161.md) In fact, we owe to the
Persians a valuable testimony to the God in whom is no darkness at all.
"The prayer of Ajax was for light"; and we too little feel the Fire
which burns and shines beyond the stars.

In Central India the sun and moon are worshipped by many tribes, as the
Khonds, Korkús, Tunguses, and Buraets. The Korkús adore the powers of
nature, as the gods of the tiger, bison, the hill, the cholera, etc.,
"but these are all secondary to the sun and the moon, which among this
branch of the Kolarian stock, as among the Kols in the far east, are the
principal objects of adoration." <span
id="fr_161"></span>[160](ml21.htm#fn_162.md) "Although the Tongusy in
general worship the sun and moon, there are many exceptions to this
observation. I have found intelligent people among them, who believed
that there was a being superior to both sun and moon; and who created
them and all the world." <span
id="fr_162"></span>[160\*](ml21.htm#fn_163.md) This last sentence we read
with gratitude, but not with surprise. There is some good in all, if
there seem to be all good in some.

"The aboriginal tribes in the Dekkan of India also acknowledge the
presence of the sun and moon by an act of reverence." <span
id="fr_163"></span>[161](ml21.htm#fn_164.md)

The inhabitants of the island of Celebes, in the East Indian
Archipelago, "formerly acknowledged no gods but the sun and the moon,
which were held to be eternal. Ambition for superiority made them

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

fall out." <span id="fr_164"></span>[162](ml21.htm#fn_165.md) According to
Milton, ambition created unpleasantness in the Hebrew heaven.

In Northern Asia the moon had adoring admirers among the Samoyedes, the
Morduans, the Tschuwasches, and other tribes. This is stated by Sir John
Lubbock. <span id="fr_165"></span>[163](ml21.htm#fn_166.md) Lord Kames
says: "The people of Borneo worship the sun and moon as real divinities.
The Samoides worship both, bowing to them morning and evening in the
Persian manner." <span id="fr_166"></span>[164](ml21.htm#fn_167.md) The
*Samoides* are the "salmon-eaters" of Asia.

Moon-worship in China is of ancient origin, and exists in our own time.
Professor Legge tells us that the primitive *shih* "is the symbol for
manifestation and revelation. The upper part of it is the same as that
in the older form of Tî, indicating 'what is above'; but of the three
lines below I have not found a satisfactory account. Hsü Shăn says they
represent 'the sun, moon, and stars,' and that the whole symbolizes 'the
indications by these bodies of the will of Heaven! Shih therefore tells
us that the Chinese fathers believed that there was communication
between heaven and men. The idea of revelation did not shock them. The
special interpretation of the strokes below, however, if it were
established, would lead us to think that even then, so far back, there
was the commencement of astrological superstition, and also, perhaps, of
Sabian worship." <span id="fr_167"></span>[165](ml21.htm#fn_168.md)
Sabianism, as most readers are aware, is the adoration of the armies of
heaven: the word being derived from the Hebrew *tzaba*, a host. Dr.
Legge leaves<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

Chinese Sabianism in some doubt, in the above quotation; but later on he
speaks of the spirits associated with the solstitial worship, whose
intercession was thus secured, "I, the emperor of the Great Illustrious
dynasty, have respectfully prepared this paper, to inform the spirit of
the sun, the spirit of the moon, the spirits of the five planets, of the
constellations of the zodiac, and of all the stars in all the sky," and
so on: and the professor adds: "This paper shows how there had grown up
around the primitive monotheism of China the recognition and worship of
a multitude of celestial and terrestrial spirits." <span
id="fr_168"></span>[166](ml21.htm#fn_169.md) This is ample evidence to
prove moon-worship. True, these celestial beings were "but ministering
spirits," and the "monotheism remained." There was no *henotheism*, no
worship of several *single* supreme deities: *One only* was supreme. So
among the Hebrews, Persians, Hindoos, there was one only God; and yet
they offered prayers and sacrifices to heaven's visible and innumerable
host. When we come to modern China we shall find some very remarkable
celebrations taking place, which throw sunlight upon these ancient
mists. Meanwhile to strengthen our position, we may draw additional
support from each of the three great stages reached in the progress of
Chinese religion: namely, Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Dr. Edkins
describes them as the moral, materialistic, and metaphysical systems,
standing at the three corners of a great triangle. <span
id="fr_169"></span>[167](ml21.htm#fn_170.md) The god of Confucianism

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

is *Shang-tî* or *Shang-te*. And with the universal anthropomorphism
"Shang-te is the great father of gods and men: Shang-te is a gigantic
man." <span id="fr_170"></span>[168](ml21.htm#fn_171.md) Again "Heaven is a
great man, and man is a little heaven." <span
id="fr_171"></span>[169](ml21.htm#fn_172.md) And now what does Confucianism
say of moon-worship? "The sun and moon being the chief objects of
veneration to the most ancient ancestors of the Chinese, they translated
the soul of their great father heaven or the first man (Shang-te) to the
sun, and the soul of their great mother earth or the first woman (the
female half of the first man) to the moon." <span
id="fr_172"></span>[170](ml21.htm#fn_173.md) In Taoism there is no room for
question. Dr. Legge says that it had its Chang and Liû, and "many more
gods, supreme gods, celestial gods, great gods, and divine
rulers." <span id="fr_173"></span>[171](ml21.htm#fn_174.md) And Dr. Edkins
writes: "The Taouist mythology resembles, in several points, that of
many heathen nations. Some of its divinities personate those beings that
are supposed to reside in the various departments of nature. Many of the
stars are worshipped as gods." <span
id="fr_174"></span>[172](ml21.htm#fn_175.md) Buddhism not only supplies
further evidence, it also furnishes a noteworthy instance of mythic
transformation. Sakchi or Sasi, the moon, is literally one who made a
sacrifice. This refers to the legend of the hare who gave himself to
feed the god. The wife of Indra adopted the hare's name, and was herself
called Sasi. "The Tantra school gave every deity its Sakti or consort,
and speculation enlarged the meaning of the term still further, making
it designate female energy or the female

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

principle." <span id="fr_175"></span>[173](ml21.htm#fn_176.md) Buddhism,
then, the popular religion in China at the present day, the religion
which Dr. Farrar ventures to call "atheism fast merging into
idolatry," <span id="fr_176"></span>[174](ml21.htm#fn_177.md) is not free
from the nature worship which deifies the moon. But Buddhism, like most
other imperfect systems, has precious gold mixed with its dross; and at
the expense of a digression we delight to quote the statement of a
recent writer, who says: "There is no record, known to me, in the whole
of the long history of Buddhism, throughout the many countries where its
followers have been for such lengthened periods supreme, of any
persecution by the Buddhists of the followers of any other faith." <span
id="fr_177"></span>[175](ml21.htm#fn_178.md) How glad we should feel if we
could assert the same of the Christian Church!

We come at once to those celebrations which still take place in China,
and illustrate the worship of the moon. The festival of
*Yuĕ-Ping*--which is held annually during the eighth month, from the
first day when the moon is new, to the fifteenth, when it is full-is of
high antiquity and of deep interest. Dr. Morrison says that "the custom
of civil and military officers going on the first and fifteenth of every
moon to the civil and military temples to burn incense, began in the
time of the Lŭh Chaon," which would be not far from A.D. 550. Also that
the "eighth month, fifteenth day, is called Chung-tsew-tsëë. It is said
that the Emperor Ming-hwang, of the dynasty Tang, was one night led to
the palace of the moon, where he saw a large assembly of
Chang-go-sëën-neu--

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

female divinities playing on instruments of music. Persons now, from the
first to the fifteenth, make cakes like the moon, of various sizes, and
paint figures upon them: these are called Yuĕ-ping, 'mooncakes.' Friends
and relations pay visits, purchase and present the cakes to each other,
and give entertainments. At full moon they spread out oblations and make
prostrations to the moon." <span
id="fr_178"></span>[176](ml21.htm#fn_179.md) Dennys writes: "The fifteenth
day of the eighth month is a day on which a ceremony is performed by the
Chinese, which of all others we should least expect to find imitated
among ourselves. Most people resident in China have seen the moon-cakes
which so delight the heart of the Chinese during the eighth month of
every year. These are made for an autumnal festival often described as
'congratulating' or 'rewarding' the moon. The moon, it is well known,
represents the female principle in Chinese celestial cosmogony, and she
is further supposed to be inhabited by a multitude of beautiful females;
the cakes made in her honour are therefore veritable offerings to the
Queen of the Heavens. Now in a part of Lancashire, on the banks of the
Ribble, there exists a precisely similar custom of making cakes in
honour of the 'Queen of Heaven,'--a relic, in all probability, of the
old heathen worship which was the common fount of the two
customs." <span id="fr_179"></span>[177](ml21.htm#fn_180.md) Witness is
also borne to this ceremony by a well-known traveller. "We arrived at
Chaborté on the fifteenth day of the eighth moon, the anniversary of

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

great rejoicings among the Chinese. This festival, known as the
*Yué-Ping* (loaves of the moon), dates from the remotest antiquity. Its
original purpose was to honour the moon with superstitious rites. On
this solemn day, all labour is suspended; the workmen receive from their
employers a present of money, every person puts on his best clothes; and
there is merry-making in every family. Relations and friends interchange
cakes of various sizes, on which is stamped the image of the moon; that
is to say, a hare crouching amid a small group of trees." <span
id="fr_180"></span>[178](ml21.htm#fn_181.md) And Doolittle says: "It is
always full moon on the fifteenth of every Chinese month; and,
therefore, for several days previous, the evenings are bright, unless it
happens to be cloudy, which is not often the case. The moon is a
prominent object of attention and congratulation at this time. At
Canton, it is said, offerings are made to the moon on the fifteenth. On
the following day, young people amuse themselves by playing what is
called *'pursuing*,' or '*congratulating*' the moon. At this city
\[Fuhchau\], in the observance of this festival, the expression
'*rewarding the moon*' is more frequently used than 'congratulating the
moon.' It is a common saying that there is 'a white rabbit in the moon
pounding out rice.' The dark and the white spots on the moon's face
suggest the idea of that animal engaged in the useful employment of
shelling rice. The notion is prevalent that the moon is inhabited by a
multitude of beautiful females, who are called by the name of an

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

ancient beauty who once visited that planet; but how they live, and what
they do, is not a matter of knowledge or of common fame. To the
question, 'Is the moon inhabited?' discussed by some Western
philosophers, the Chinese would answer in the affirmative. Several
species of trees and flowers are supposed to flourish in the moon. Some
say that, one night in ancient times, one of the three souls of the
originator of theatrical plays rambled away to the moon and paid a visit
to the Lunar Palace. He found it filled with Lunarians engaged in
theatrical performances. He is said to have remembered the manner of
conducting fashionable theatres in the moon, and to have imitated them
after his return to this earth. About the time of the festival of the
middle of autumn, the bake shops provide an immense amount and variety
of cakes: many of them are circular, in imitation of the shape of the
moon at that time, and are from six to twelve inches in diameter. Some
are in the form of a pagoda, or of a horse and rider, or of a fish, or
other animals which please and cause the cake to be readily sold. Some
of these 'moon-cakes' have a white rabbit, engaged with his pounder,
painted on one side, together with a lunar beauty, and some trees or
shrubs; on others are painted gods or goddesses, animals, flowers, or
persons, according to fancy." <span
id="fr_181"></span>[179](ml21.htm#fn_182.md)

If we turn now to Jeremiah vii. 18, and read there, "The women knead
dough, to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven, and to pour out drink
offerings

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

unto other gods," and remember that, according to Rashi, these cakes of
the Hebrews had the image of the god or goddess stamped upon them, we
are in view of a fact of much interest. We are so unaccustomed to think
that our peasants in Lancashire can have anything in common with the
Chinese five thousand miles away, and with the Jews of two thousand five
hundred years ago, that to many these moon-cakes will give a genuine
surprise. But this is not all. Other analogies appear between Buddhist
and Christian rites, such as those mentioned by Dr. Medhurst. "The very
titles of their intercessors, such as 'goddess of mercy,' 'holy mother,'
'queen of heaven,' with the image of a virgin, having a child in her
arms, holding a cross, are all such striking coincidences, that the
Catholic missionaries were greatly stumbled at the resemblance between
the Chinese worship and their own, when they came over to convert the
natives to Christianity." <span
id="fr_182"></span>[180](ml21.htm#fn_183.md) It is for the philosophical
historian to show, if possible, whether these Chinese ceremonies are
copies of Christian or Hebrew originals; or whether, many of our own
Western forms with others of Oriental character, are not transcripts of
primitive faiths now well-nigh forgotten in both East and West. The hot
cross buns of Good Friday, at first sight, have little relevancy to moon
worship, and those who eat them suppose they were originated to
commemorate the Christian Sacrifice; but we know that the cross was a
sacred symbol with the earliest Egyptians, for it is

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

carved upon their imperishable records; we know too that *bun* itself is
ancient Greek, and that Winckelmann relates the discovery at Herculaneum
of two perfect buns, each marked with a cross: while the *boun*
described by Hesychius was a cake with a representation of *two horns*.
Incredible as it may seem to some, the cross bun in its origin had
nothing to do with an event with which it is in England identified; it
probably commemorates the worship of the moon. In passing from China, we
may also note the influence of that sexuality of which we have spoken
before. Dr. Medhurst remarks: "The principle of the Chinese cosmogony
seems to be founded on a sexual system of the universe." <span
id="fr_183"></span>[181](ml21.htm#fn_184.md)

Dr. Prichard tells us that among the Japanese sacred festivals are held
at certain seasons of the year and at changes of the moon." Also, "It
appears that *Sin-too*, or original Japanese religion, is merely a form
of the worship of material objects, common to all the nations of
Northern Asia, which, among the more civilized tribes, assumes the
aspect of mythology." <span id="fr_184"></span>[182](ml21.htm#fn_185.md)

From Asia we come to Africa, and to Egypt, that wonderful land with a
lithographed history at least five thousand years old; a land that
basked in the sunshine of civilization and culture when nearly the whole
world without was in shadow and gloom. The mighty pyramid of Gizeh still
stands, a monument of former national greatness, and a marvel to the
admirer of sublimity in design and perfection in

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

execution. "The setting of the sides to the cardinal points is so exact
as to prove that the Egyptians were excellent observers of the
elementary facts of astronomy." <span
id="fr_185"></span>[183](ml21.htm#fn_186.md) But they went farther.
Diodorus says: "The first generation of men in Egypt, contemplating the
beauty of the superior world, and admiring with astonishment the frame
and order of the universe, judged that there were two chief gods that
were eternal, that is to say, the sun and the moon, the first of which
they called *Osiris*, and the other *Isis*." <span
id="fr_186"></span>[184](ml21.htm#fn_187.md) This passage is proof that the
Greeks and Romans had a very limited acquaintance with Egyptian
mythology; for the historian was indubitably in error in supposing
Osiris and Isis to be sun and moon. But he was right in calling the sun
and moon the first gods of the Egyptians. Rawlinson says: "The Egyptians
had two moon-gods, Khons or Khonsu, and Tet or Thoth." <span
id="fr_187"></span>[185](ml21.htm#fn_188.md) Dr. Birch has translated an
inscription relating to Thoth, which reads: "All eyes are open on thee,
and all men worship thee as a god." <span
id="fr_188"></span>[186](ml21.htm#fn_189.md) And M. Renouf says: "The
Egyptian god Tehuti is known to the readers of Plato under the name of
Thōyth. He represents the moon, which he wears upon his head, either as
crescent or as full disk." <span
id="fr_189"></span>[187](ml21.htm#fn_190.md) The same learned Egyptologist
tells us that Khonsu or Chonsu was one of the triad of Theban gods, and
was the moon one of his attributes being the reckoner of time. <span
id="fr_190"></span>[188](ml21.htm#fn_191.md) Of the former divinity,
Rawlinson relates an instructive myth. "According to one legend Thoth

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

once wrote a wonderful book, full of wisdom and science, containing in
it everything relating to the fowls of the air, the fishes of the sea,
and the four-footed beasts of the mountains. The man who knew a single
page of the work could charm the heaven, the earth, the great abyss, the
mountains and the seas. This marvellous composition he inclosed in a box
of gold, which he placed within a box of silver; the box of silver
within a box of ivory and ebony, and that again within a box of bronze;
the box of bronze within a box of brass; and the box of brass within a
box of iron; and the book, thus guarded, he threw into the Nile at
Coptos. The fact became known, and the book was searched for and found.
It gave its possessor vast knowledge and magical power, but it always
brought on him misfortune. What became of it ultimately does not appear
in the manuscript from which this account is taken; but the moral of the
story seems to be the common one, that unlawful knowledge is punished by
all kinds of calamity." <span id="fr_191"></span>[189](ml21.htm#fn_192.md)
There is also a story of the moon-god Chonsu, which is worthy of
repetition. Its original is in the *Bibliothèque Nationale* at Paris,
and for its first translation we are indebted to Dr. Birch, of the
British Museum. <span id="fr_192"></span>[190](ml21.htm#fn_193.md) A
certain Asiatic princess of Bechten, wherever that was, was possessed by
a spirit. Being connected, through her sister's marriage, with the court
of Egypt, on her falling ill, an Egyptian practitioner was summoned to
her aid. He declared that she had a demon, with which he

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

himself was unable to cope. Thereupon the image of the moon-god Chonsu
was despatched in his mystic ark, for the purpose of exorcising the
spirit and delivering the princess. The demon at once yielded to the
divine influence; and the king of Bechten was so delighted that he kept
the image in his possession for upwards of three years. In consequence
of an alarming dream he then sent him back to Egypt with presents of
great value. Whatever evil powers the moon may have exerted since, we
must credit him with having once ejected an evil spirit and prolonged a
royal life.

Returning to Thoth, we find the following valuable hints in the great
work of Baron Bunsen:--"The connection between Tet and the moon may
allude, according to Wilkinson, to the primitive use of a lunar year.
The ancients had already remarked that the moon in Egyptian was
masculine, not feminine, as the Greeks and Romans generally made it.
Still we have no right to suppose a particular moon-god, separate from
Thoth. We meet with a deity called after the moon (Aah) either as a mere
personification, or as Thoth, in whom the agency of the moon and nature
become a living principle. We find him so represented in the tombs of
the Ramesseum, opposite to Phre; a similar representation in Dendyra is
probably symbolical. According to Champollion he is often seen in the
train of Ammon, and then he is Thoth. He makes him green, with the four
sceptres and

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

cup of Ptah, by the side of which, however, is a sort of Horus curl, the
infantine lock, as child or son. In the inscriptions there is usually
only the crescent, but on one occasion the sign *nuter* (god) is added.
In the tombs a moon-god is represented sitting on a bark, and holding
the sceptre of benign power, to whom two Cynocephali are doing homage,
followed by the Crescent and Nuter god. Lastly, the same god is found in
a standing posture, worshipped by two souls and two Cynocephali." <span
id="fr_193"></span>[191](ml21.htm#fn_194.md)

With these "dog-headed" worshippers of the moon may be associated
another animal that from an early date has been connected with the
luminaries of the day and night. We saw that the Australian moon-myth of
Mityan was of a native cat. Renouf says: "It is not improbable that the
cat, in Egyptian *mäu*, became the symbol of the Sun-god, or Day,
because the word mäu also means light." <span
id="fr_194"></span>[192](ml21.htm#fn_195.md) Charles James Fox, with no
thought of Egyptian, told the Prince of Wales that "cats always prefer
the sunshine." The native land of this domestic pet, or nuisance, is
certainly Persia, and some etymologists assign *pers* as the origin of
*puss*. Be this as it may, the pupil of a cat's eye is singularly
changeable, dilating from the narrow line in the day-time to the
luminous orb in the dark. On this account the cat is likened to the
moon. But in Egypt feline eyes shine with supernatural lustre. Mr. Hyde
Clarke tells us that "the mummies of cats, which Herodotus saw at
Bubastis, attested then, as they do now, to the

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

dedication of the cat to Pasht, the moon, and the veneration of the
Egyptians for this animal. The cat must have been known to man, and have
been named at least as early as the origin of language. The superstition
of its connection with the moon is also of pre-historic date, and not
invented by the Egyptians. According to Plutarch, a cat placed in a
lustrum denoted the moon, illustrating the mutual symbology. He supposes
that this is because the pupils of a cat's eyes dilate and decrease with
the moon. The reason most probably depends, as before intimated, on
another phenomenon of periodicity corresponding to the month. Dr. Rae
has, however, called my attention to another possible cause of the
association, which is the fact that the cat's eyes glisten at night or
in the dark. It is to be observed that the name of the sun in the
Malayan and North American languages is the day-eye, or sky-eye, and
that of the moon the night-eye." <span
id="fr_195"></span>[193](ml21.htm#fn_196.md) Our own daisy, too, is the
*day's eye*, resembling the sun, and opening its little pearly lashes
when the spring wakes to newness of life.

The Nubians "pay adoration to the moon; and that their worship is
performed with pleasure and satisfaction, is obvious every night that
she shines. Coming out from the darkness of their huts, they say a few
words upon seeing her brightness, and testify great joy, by motions of
their feet and hands, at the first appearance of the new moon." <span
id="fr_196"></span>[194](ml21.htm#fn_197.md) The Shangalla worship the
moon, and think that "a star

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

passing near the horns of the moon denotes the coming of an
enemy." <span id="fr_197"></span>[195](ml21.htm#fn_198.md) In Western
Africa moon-worship is very prevalent. Merolla says: "They that keep
idols in their houses, every first day of the moon are obliged to anoint
them with a sort of red wood powdered. At the appearance of every new
moon, these people fall on their knees, or else cry out, standing and
clapping their hands, 'So may I renew my life as thou art
renewed.'" <span id="fr_198"></span>[196](ml21.htm#fn_199.md)

H. H. Johnston, Esq., F.Z.S., F.R.G.S., who had just returned from the
region of the Congo, related the following curious incident before the
Anthropological Institute, in January, 1884. It looks remarkably like a
relic of ancient worship, which gave the fruit of the body for the sin
of the soul, and committed murder on earth to awaken mercy in heaven!
"At certain villages between Manyanga and Isangila there are curious
eunuch dances to celebrate the new moon, in which a white cock is thrown
up into the air alive, with clipped wings, and as it falls towards the
ground it is caught and plucked by the eunuchs. I was told that
originally this used to be a human sacrifice, and that a young boy or
girl was thrown up into the air and torn to pieces by the eunuchs as he
or she fell, but that of late years slaves had got scarce or manners
milder, and a white cock was now substituted." <span
id="fr_199"></span>[197](ml21.htm#fn_200.md)

The Mandingoes are more attracted to the varying moon than to the sun.
"On the first appearance of the new moon, which they look upon to be

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

newly created, the Pagan natives, as well as Mahomedans, say a short
prayer; and this seems to be the only visible adoration which the
Kaffirs offer up to the Supreme Being." The purport of this prayer is
"to return thanks to God for His kindness through the existence of the
past moon, and to solicit a continuation of His favour during that of
the new one." <span id="fr_200"></span>[198](ml21.htm#fn_201.md) Park
writes on another page: "When the fast month was almost at an end, the
Bushreens assembled at the Misura to watch for the appearance of the new
moon; but the evening being rather cloudy, they were for some time
disappointed, and a number of them had gone home with a resolution to
fast another day, when on a sudden this delightful object showed her
sharp horns from behind a cloud, and was welcomed with the clapping of
hands, beating of drums, firing muskets, and other marks of
rejoicing." <span id="fr_201"></span>[199](ml21.htm#fn_202.md) The Makololo
and Bechuana custom of greeting the new moon is curious. "They watch
most eagerly for the first glimpse of the new moon, and when they
perceive the faint outline after the sun has set deep in the west, they
utter a loud shout of 'Kuā!' and vociferate prayers to it." <span
id="fr_202"></span>[200](ml21.htm#fn_203.md) The degraded Hottentots have
not much improved since Bory de St. Vincent described them as "brutish,
lazy, and stupid," and their worship of the moon is still demonstrative,
as when Kolben wrote: "These dances and noises are religious honours and
invocations to the moon. They call her *Gounja*. The Supreme they call
*Gounja-Gounja*,

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

or *Gounja* *Ticquoa*, the god of gods, and place him far above the
moon. The moon, with them, is an inferior visible god--the subject and
representation of the High and Invisible. They judge the moon to have
the disposal of the weather, and invoke her for such as they want. They
assemble for the celebration of her worship at full and change
constantly. No inclemency of the weather prevents them. And their
behaviour at those times is indeed very astonishing. They throw their
bodies into a thousand different distortions, and make mouths and faces
strangely ridiculous and horrid. Now they throw themselves flat on the
ground, screaming out a strange, unintelligible jargon. Then jumping up
on a sudden, and stamping like mad (insomuch that they make the ground
shake), they direct, with open throats, the following expressions, among
others, to the moon: '*I salute you; you are welcome. Grant us fodder
for our cattle and milk in abundance*.' These and other addresses to the
moon they repeat over and over, accompanying them with dancing and
clapping of hands. At the end of the dance they sing '*Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!*'
many times over, with a variation of notes; which being accompanied with
clapping of hands makes a very odd and a very merry entertainment to a
stranger." <span id="fr_203"></span>[201](ml21.htm#fn_204.md) In reality
they hold a primitive watch-night service; their welcome of the new moon
being very similar to our popular welcome of the new year. Nor should it
be omitted that the ancient Ethiopians worshipped

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

the moon; and that those who lived above Meroë admitted the existence of
eternal and incorruptible gods, among which the moon ranked as a chief
divinity.

Descending the Nile and crossing the Mediterranean, we come to Greece.

"The isles of Greece, the isles of Greece  
  Where burning Sappho loved and sung,  
Where grew the arts of war and peace,  
  Where Delos rose, and Phœbus sprung  
Eternal summer gilds them yet,  
But all, except their sun, is set." <span
id="fr_204"></span>[202](ml21.htm#fn_205.md)

Yes, Pericles and Plato, Sophocles and Pheidias, are dust; and much of
their nation's pristine glory has "melted into the infinite azure of the
past": but the sun shines as youthful yet as on that eventful day when
unwearied he sank in ocean, "loth, and ere his time:

"So the sun sank, and all the host had rest  
From onset and the changeful chance of war." <span
id="fr_205"></span>[203](ml21.htm#fn_206.md)

Where Phœbus sprang, sprang Phœbe also--the bright and beautiful moon.
To a people addicted to the idolatry of perfect form and comeliness, no
object could be more attractive than the queen of the night. When
Socrates was accused of innovating upon the Greek religion, and of
ridiculing the Athenian deities, he replied on his trial, "You strange
man, Melêtus, are you seriously affirming that I do not think Helios and
Selene to be

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

gods, as the rest of mankind think?" <span
id="fr_206"></span>[204](ml21.htm#fn_207.md) Pausanias, the historian,
tells us that in Phocis there was a chapel consecrated to Isis, which of
all the places erected by the Greeks to this Egyptian goddess was by far
the most holy. It was not lawful for any one to approach this sacred
edifice but those whom the goddess had invited by appearing to them for
that purpose in a dream. <span id="fr_207"></span>[205](ml21.htm#fn_208.md)
By Isis, as we saw from Diodorus, the Greeks understood the moon. Diana
was also one of the Grecian moon-goddesses, but Sir George C. Lewis
thinks that this was not till a comparatively late period. The religion
of Greece was so mixed up, or made up, with mythology, that for an
interpretation of their theogony we must resort to poetry and
impersonation. Here again we see the working of sexual anthropomorphism.
*Ouranos* espoused *Ge*, and their offspring was *Kronos*; which is but
an ancient mode of saying that chronology is the measurement on earth of
heavenly motion. Solar and lunar worship was but the recognition in the
primitive consciousness of the superior *worth-ship* of these celestial
bodies. As Grote says: "To us these now appear puerile, though pleasing
fancies, but to our Homeric Greek they seemed perfectly natural and
plausible. In his view, the description of the sun, as given in a modern
astronomical treatise, would have appeared not merely absurd, but
repulsive and impious." <span id="fr_208"></span>[206](ml21.htm#fn_209.md)
What an amount of misunderstanding would be obviated if readers of the
Bible would bear this

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

in mind when they meet with erroneous conceptions in Hebrew cosmogony.
Grote further says on the same page of his magnificent history:
"Personifying fiction was blended by the Homeric Greeks with their
conception of the physical phenomena before them, not simply in the way
of poetical ornament, but as a genuine portion of their everyday
belief." We cannot better conclude our brief glance at ancient Greece
than by quoting that splendid comparison from the bard of Chios, which
Pope thought "the most beautiful night-piece that can be found in
poetry." Pope's own version is fine, but, as a translation, Lord Derby's
must be preferred:

"As when in heaven, around the glittering moon  
The stars shine bright amid the breathless air;:  
And every crag and every jutting peak  
Stands boldly forth, and every forest glade  
Even to the gates of heaven is opened wide  
The boundless sky; shines each particular star  
Distinct; joy fills the gazing shepherd's heart." <span
id="fr_209"></span>[207](ml21.htm#fn_210.md)

The Romans had many gods, superior and inferior. The former were the
*celestial* deities, twelve in number, among whom was Diana; and the
*Dii Selecti*, numbering eight. Of these, one was Luna, the moon,
daughter of Hyperion and sister of the Sun. <span
id="fr_210"></span>[208](ml21.htm#fn_211.md) Livy speaks of "a temple of
Luna, which is on the Aventine"; and Tacitus mentions, in his Annals, a
temple consecrated to the moon. In Horace, Luna is "*siderum
regina*"; <span id="fr_211"></span>[209](ml21.htm#fn_212.md) and in
Apuleius,<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

"*Regina coeli*," <span id="fr_212"></span>[210](ml21.htm#fn_213.md) Bishop
Warburton, in his synopsis of Apuleius, speaks of the hopeless condition
of *Lucius*, which obliged him to fly to heaven for relief. "The *moon*
is in full splendour; and the awful silence of the night inspires him
with sentiments of religion." He then purifies himself, and so makes his
prayer to the moon, invoking her by her several names, as the celestial
*Venus* and *Diana*. <span id="fr_213"></span>[211](ml21.htm#fn_214.md)
This whole section of the *Divine Legation* is worthy of close study.

"The ancient Goths," says Rudbeck ("Atalantis," ii. 609), "paid such
regard to the moon, that some have thought that they worshipped her more
than the sun." <span id="fr_214"></span>[212](ml21.htm#fn_215.md)

And of the ancient Germans Grimm says: "That to our remote ancestry the
heavenly bodies, especially the sun and moon, were divine beings, will
not admit of any doubt." <span id="fr_215"></span>[213](ml21.htm#fn_216.md)
Gibbon, Friedrich Schlegel, and others, say the same.

The Finns worshipped "Kun, the male god of the moon, who corresponded
exactly with the Aku, Enizuna, or Itu of the Accadians." <span
id="fr_216"></span>[214](ml21.htm#fn_217.md)

In ancient Britain the moon occupied a high position in the religion of
the Druids, who had superstitious rites at the lunar changes, and who
are "always represented as having the crescent in their hands." <span
id="fr_217"></span>[215](ml21.htm#fn_218.md) "From the *Penitential* of
Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the seventh century, and the
*Confessional* of Ecgbert, Archbishop of York, in the early part of the
eighth century, we may

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

infer that homage was then offered to the sun and moon." <span
id="fr_218"></span>[216](ml21.htm#fn_219.md) Again, "There are many proofs,
direct and circumstantial, that place it beyond all doubt that the moon
was one of the objects of heathen worship in Britain. But under what
name the moon was invoked is not discoverable, unless it may have been
Andraste, the goddess to whom the British queen Boadicea, with hands
outstretched to heaven, appealed when about to engage in battle with the
Romans." <span id="fr_219"></span>[217](ml21.htm#fn_220.md) A writer of the
seventeenth century, says: " In Yorkeshire, etc., northwards, some
country woemen do-e worship the New Moon on their bare knees, kneeling
upon an earthfast stone. And the people of Athol, in the High-lands in
Scotland, doe worship the: New Moon." <span
id="fr_220"></span>[218](ml21.htm#fn_221.md) Camden writes of the Irish:
"Whether or no they worship the moon, I know not; but, when they first
see her after the change, they commonly bow the knee, and say the Lord's
Prayer; and near the wane, address themselves to her with a loud voice,
after this manner: "Leave us as well as thou foundest us." <span
id="fr_221"></span>[219](ml21.htm#fn_222.md)" Sylvester O'Halloran, the
Irish general and historian, speaking of "the correspondent customs of
the Phœnicians and the Irish," adds: "Their deities were the same. They
both adored Bel, or the sun, the Moon, and the stars. The house of
Rimmon (2 Kings v. 18), which the Phœnicians worshipped in, like our
temples of Fleachta, in Meath, was sacred to the moon. The word 'Rimmon'
has by no means been understood by the different commentators; and yet
by recurring

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

to the Irish (a branch of the Phœnicians) it becomes very intelligible;
for *Re* is Irish for the moon, and *Muadh* signifies an image; and the
compound word *Reamham* signifies prognosticating by the appearances of
the moon. It appears by the life of our great St. Columba, that the
Druid temples were *here* decorated with figures of the sun, the moon,
and the stars. The Phœnicians, under the name of Bel-Samen, adored the
Supreme; and it is pretty remarkable that *to this very day*, to wish a
friend every happiness this life can afford, we say in Irish, '*the
blessings of Samen and Eel be with you*!' that is, of all the seasons;
Bel signifying the sun, and Samhain the moon." <span
id="fr_222"></span>[220](ml21.htm#fn_223.md) And again: "Next to the sun
was the moon, which the Irish undoubtedly adored. Some remains of this
worship may be traced, even at this day; as particularly borrowing, if
they should not have it about them, a piece of silver on the first night
of a new moon, as an omen of plenty during the month; and at the same
time saying in Irish, 'As you have found us in peace and prosperity, so
leave us in grace and mercy.'" <span
id="fr_223"></span>[221](ml21.htm#fn_224.md) Tuathal, the prince to whom
the estates (*circa* A.D. 106) swore solemnly "by the sun, moon, and
stars, "to bear true allegiance," in that portion of the imperial domain
taken from Munster, erected a magnificent temple called Flachta, sacred
to the fire of Samhain, and to the Samnothei, or priests of the moon.
Here, on every eve of November, were the fires of Samhain lighted up,
with great pomp and ceremony, the monarch, the Druids, and

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

the chiefs of the kingdom attending; and from this holy fire, and no
other, was every fire in the land first lit for the winter. It was
deemed an act of the highest impiety to kindle the winter fires from any
other; and for this favour the head of every house paid a Scrubal, or
threepence, tax, to the Arch-Druid of Samhain." <span
id="fr_224"></span>[222](ml21.htm#fn_225.md) Another writer mentions
another Irish moon-god. "The next heathen divinity which I would bring
under notice is St. Luan, *alias* Molua, *alias* Euan, *alias* Lugidus,
*alias* Lugad, and Moling, etc. The foundations, with which this saint
under some of his *aliases* is connected, extend over eight counties in
the provinces of Ulster, Leinster, and Munster. Luan is to this; day the
common Irish word for the moon. We read that there were fifteen saints
of the name of Lugadius; and as Lugidus was one of Luan's *aliases*, I
have set them all down as representing the moon in the several places
where that planet was worshipped as the symbol of Female nature." <span
id="fr_225"></span>[223](ml21.htm#fn_226.md) We have already seen that the
moon was the embodiment of the female principle in China, and now we see
that the primitive Kelts associated sexuality with astronomy and
religion. It but further proves that "one touch of nature makes the
whole world kin."

Moreover, to show that former moon-worship still colours our religion,
it is not to be overlooked that, as our Christmas festivities are but a
continuation of the Roman saturnalia, with their interchanges of visits
and presents, so "the Church, celebrating in<span
class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

August the festival of the harvest moon, celebrates at the same time the
feast of the Assumption and of the Sacred Heart of the Virgin. And
Catholic painters, following the description in the Apocalypse, fondly
depict her as 'clothed with the sun, and having the moon under her
feet,' and both as overriding the dragon. Even the triumph of Easter is
not celebrated until, by attaining its full, the moon accords its aid
and sanction. Is it not interesting thus to discover the true note of
Catholicism in the most ancient paganisms, and to find that the moon,
which for us is incarnate in the blessed Virgin Mary, was for the
Syrians and Greeks respectively personified in the virgin Ashtoreth, the
queen of heaven, and Diana, or Phœbe, the feminine of Phœbus?" <span
id="fr_226"></span>[224](ml21.htm#fn_227.md)

A recent contributor to one of our valuable serials writes: "I take the
following extract from a little book published under the auspices of Dr.
Barnardo. It is the 'truthful narrative' of a little sweep-girl picked
up in the streets of some place near Brighton, and 'admitted into Dr.
Barnardo's Village Home.' 'She had apparently no knowledge of God or
sense of His presence. The only thing she had any reverence for was the
moon. On one occasion, when the children were going to evening service,
and a beautiful moon was shining, one of them pointed to it, exclaiming,
'Oh, mother! look, what a beautiful moon!' Little Mary caught hold of
her hand, and cried, 'Yer mustn't point at the blessed moon like that;
and yer mustn't talk about it!' Was it from

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

constantly sleeping under hedges and in barns, and waking up and seeing
that bright calm eye looking at her, that some sense of a mysterious
Presence had come upon the child?" <span
id="fr_227"></span>[225](ml21.htm#fn_228.md) To this query, the answer we
think should be negative. The cause more likely was that she had heard
the common tradition which is yet current in East Lancashire,
Cumberland, and elsewhere, that it is a sin to point at the moon.
Certain old gentlemen, who ought to be better informed, still touch
their hats, and devout young girls in the country districts still
curtsey, to the new moon, as an act of worship.

The American races practise luniolatry very generally. The Dakotahs
worship both sun and moon. The Delaware and Iroquois Indians sacrifice
to these orbs, and it is most singular that "they sacrifice to a hare,
because, according to report, the first ancestor of the Indian tribes
had that name." But, although they receive in a dream as their tutelar
spirits, the sun, moon, owl, buffalo, and so forth, "they positively
deny that they pay any adoration to these subordinate good spirits, and
affirm that they only worship the true God, through them." <span
id="fr_228"></span>[226](ml21.htm#fn_229.md) This reminds us of some
excellent remarks made by one whose intimate acquaintance with North
American Indians entitled him to speak with authority. We have seen from
Dr. Legge's writings that though the Chinese worshipped a multitude of
celestial spirits, "yet the monotheism remained." Mr. Catlin will now
assure us that though the American Indians adore the

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

heavenly bodies, they recognise the Great Spirit who inhabits them all.
These are his words: "I have heard it said by some very good men, and
some who have even been preaching the Christian religion amongst them,
that they have no religion--that all their zeal in their worship of the
Great Spirit was but the foolish excess of ignorant superstition--that
their humble devotions and supplications to the sun and the moon, where
many of them suppose that the Great Spirit resides, were but the absurd
rantings of idolatry. To such opinions as these I never yet gave answer,
nor drew other instant inferences from them, than that, from the bottom
of my heart, I pitied the persons who gave them." <span
id="fr_229"></span>[227](ml21.htm#fn_230.md) Mr. Catlin undoubtedly was
right, as the Apostle Paul was right, when he acknowledged that the
Athenians worshipped the true God, albeit in ignorance. At the same
time, though idolatry is in numberless instances nothing more than the
use of media and mediators, in seeking the One, Invisible, Absolute
Spirit, it is so naturally abused by sensuous beings who rest in the
concrete, that no image worshipper is free from the propensity to
worship the creature more than the Creator, and to forget the Essence in
familiarity with the form. The perfection of worship, we conceive, is
pure theism; but how few are capable of breathing in such a
supersensuous air! Men must have their "means of grace," their visible
symbols, their holy waters and consecrated wafers, their crucifixes and
talismans, their silver

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

shrines and golden calves. "These be thy gods, O Israel."

"The Ahts undoubtedly worship the sun and the moon, particularly the
full moon, and the sun while ascending to the zenith. Like the Teutons,
they regard the moon as the husband, and the sun as the wife; hence
their prayers are more generally addressed to the moon, as being the
superior deity. The moon is the highest of all the objects of their
worship; and they describe the moon--I quote the words of my Indian
informant--as looking down upon the earth in answer to prayer, and as
seeing everybody." <span id="fr_230"></span>[228](ml21.htm#fn_231.md) Of
the Indians of Vancouver Island, another writer says: "The moon is among
all the heavenly bodies the highest object of veneration. When working
at the settlement at Alberni in gangs by moonlight, individuals have
been observed to look up to the moon, blow a breath, and utter quickly
the word, '*Teech! teech!*' (health, or life). Life! life! this is the
great prayer of these people's hearts." <span
id="fr_231"></span>[229](ml21.htm#fn_232.md) "Among the Comanches of Texas,
the sun, moon, and earth are the principal objects of worship." The
Kaniagmioutes consider the moon and sun to be brother and sister. <span
id="fr_232"></span>[230](ml21.htm#fn_233.md)

Meztli was the moon as deified by the Mexicans. In Teotihuacan, thirty
miles north of the city of Mexico, is the site of an ancient city twenty
miles in circumference. Near the centre of this spot stand the Pyramid
of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. The Pyramid of the Sun has a
base 682 feet

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

long and is 180 feet high (the Pyramid of Cheops is 728 feet at the
base, and is 448 feet in height). The Pyramid of the Moon is rather
less, and is due north of that of the Sun. <span
id="fr_233"></span>[231](ml21.htm#fn_234.md) No doubt the philosophy of all
pyramids would show that they embody the uplifting of the human soul
towards the Heaven-Father of all.

In Northern Mexico still "the Ceris superstitiously celebrate the new
moon." <span id="fr_234"></span>[232](ml21.htm#fn_235.md) This luniolatry
the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg explains by a novel theory. He holds that
the forefathers of American civilization lived in a certain Crescent
land in the Atlantic that a physical catastrophe destroyed their country
whereupon the remnant that was saved commemorated their lost land by
adopting the moon as their god." <span
id="fr_235"></span>[233](ml21.htm#fn_236.md) "The population of Central
America," says the Vicomte de Bussierre, "although they had preserved
the vague notion of a superior eternal God and Creator, known by the
name Teotl, had an Olympus as numerous as that of the Greeks and the
Romans. It would appear that the inhabitants of Anahuac joined to the
idea of a supreme being the worship of the sun and the moon, offering
them flowers, fruits, and the first fruits of their fields." <span
id="fr_236"></span>[234](ml21.htm#fn_237.md) Dr. Reville bids us "note that
the ancient Central-American cultus of the sun and moon, considered as
the two supreme deities, was by no means renounced by the Aztecs." <span
id="fr_237"></span>[235](ml21.htm#fn_238.md) Regarding this remarkable
race, a writer in the *Quarterly Review* for April, 1883, says: "Even
the Chaldæans were not

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

greater astrologers than the Aztecs, and we need no further proof that
the heavenly bodies were closely and accurately observed, than we find
in the fact that the true length of the tropical year had been
ascertained long before scientific instruments were even thought of.
Their religious festivals were regulated by the movements of these
bodies; but with their knowledge was mingled so vast a mass of
superstition, that it is difficult to discern a gleam of light through
the thick darkness." "The Botocudos of Brazil held the moon in high
veneration, and attributed to her influence the chief phenomena in
nature." <span id="fr_238"></span>[236](ml21.htm#fn_239.md) The Indian of
the Coroados tribe in Brazil, "chained to the present, hardly ever
raises his eyes to the starry firmament. Yet he is actuated by a certain
awe of some constellations, as of everything that indicates a spiritual
connection of things. His chief attention, however, is not directed to
the sun, but to the moon; according to which he calculates time, and
from which he is used to deduce good and evil." <span
id="fr_239"></span>[237](ml21.htm#fn_240.md)

The celebrated Abipones honour with silver altars and adoration the
moon, which they call the consort of the sun, and certain stars, which
they term the handmaids of the moon: but their most singular idea is
that the Pleiades represent their grandfather; and "as that
constellation disappears at certain periods from the sky of South
America, upon such occasions they suppose that their grandfather is
sick, and are under a yearly apprehension that he

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

is going to die; but as soon as those seven stars are again visible in
the month of May, they welcome their grandfather, as if returned and
restored from sickness, with joyful shouts, and the festive sound of
pipes and trumpets, congratulating him on the recovery of his
health." <span id="fr_240"></span>[238](ml21.htm#fn_241.md)

The Peruvians "acknowledge no other gods than the Pachacamac, who is the
supreme, and the Sun, who is inferior to him, and the Moon, who is his
sister and wife." <span id="fr_241"></span>[239](ml21.htm#fn_242.md) In the
religion of the Incas the idol (huaco) of the Moon was in charge of
women, and when it was brought from the house of the Sun, to be
worshipped, it was carried on their shoulders, because they said "it was
a woman, and the figure resembled one." <span
id="fr_242"></span>[240](ml21.htm#fn_243.md) *Pachacamac*, the great deity
mentioned above, signifies "earth-animator."

Prescott, in describing the temple of the Sun, at Cuzco in Peru, tells
us that "adjoining the principal structure were several chapels of
smaller dimensions. One of them was consecrated to the Moon, the deity
held next in reverence, as the mother of the Incas. Her effigy was
delineated in the same manner as that of the Sun, on a vast plate that
nearly covered one side of the apartment. But this plate, as well as all
the decorations of the building, was of silver, as suited to the pale,
silvery light of the beautiful planet." <span
id="fr_243"></span>[241](ml21.htm#fn_244.md)

In the far-off New Hebrides the Eramangans "worship the moon, having
images in the form of the new and full moons, made of a kind of
stone.<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

They do not pray to these images, but cleave to them as their protecting
gods." <span id="fr_244"></span>[242](ml21.htm#fn_245.md)

We have now circumnavigated the globe, touching at many points, within
many degrees of latitude and longitude. But everywhere, among men of
different literatures and languages, colours and creeds, we have
discovered the worship of the moon. No nation has outgrown the practice,
for it obtains among the polished as well as the rude. One thing,
indeed, we ought to have had impressed upon our minds with fresh force;
namely, that we often draw the lines of demarcation too broad between
those whom we are pleased to divide into the civilized and the savage.
Israelite and heathen, Grecian and barbarian, Roman and pagan,
enlightened and benighted, saintly and sinful, are fine distinctions
from the Hebrew, Greek, Roman, enlightened, and saintly sides of the
question; but they often reflect small credit upon the wisdom and
generosity of their authors. The antipodal Eramangan who cleaves to his
moon image for protection may be quite equal, both intellectually and
morally, with the Anglo-Saxon who still wears his amulet to ward off
disease, or nails up his horse-shoe, as Nelson did to the mast of the
*Victory*, as a guarantee of good luck. Sir George Grey has written: "It
must be borne in mind, that the native races, who believed in these
traditions or superstitions, are in no way deficient in intellect, and
in no respect incapable of receiving the truths of Christianity; on the
contrary, they readily embrace

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

its doctrines and submit to its rules; in our schools they stand a fair
comparison with Europeans; and, when instructed in Christian truths,
blush at their own former ignorance and superstitions, and look back
with shame and loathing upon their previous state of wickedness and
credulity." <span id="fr_245"></span>[243](ml21.htm#fn_246.md)
