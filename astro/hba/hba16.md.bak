## THE HINDU YOGIS’ RULES FOR ATTAINING HEALTH, WEALTH AND HAPPINESS;

###### OR,

#### How to Banish Disease and Abolish Poverty

The Hindu Yogi is a seer or sage who, by deep and long meditation,
prayer, study of man and the universe, at last reaches illumination or
wisdom, whereby he thoroughly understands the many perplexing problems
of life and can solve them.

This planet leas now reached that stage of evolution where its highest
order of inhabitants are beginning to awake to a realization of their
wonderful greatness. The ignorance and darkness of the past ages is
being dissipated by the Light of Truth —modern thought.

#### FALSE TEACHING CAUSE OF WOE AND MISERY.

For thousands of years man has been ruled and governed by much false
teaching. He has been

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

told that he is a miserable worm and been made a weakling and an arrant
coward by the fear of punishment by a wrathful and angry God who ever
sits in judgment on his every act. With such teachings and such a God he
could make little progress, because fear is always weakening and never
inspires hope or courage. The Yogis, who are the greatest lovers and
worshippers of God in the world, say that the great Ruler of this
universe is all mercy, all love, all helping and never punishes; that a
man is all-powerful, all-forceful and not limited; that ALL are ONE. All
that a man has got to do is to realize what a great and powerful being
he is, and then the can accomplish anything he desires.

#### THE REAL AND THE APPARENT MAN.

"What is that, knowing which, everything else is to be known?" This is
the one theme that the Yogi dwells upon, and as thought can by
persistent concentration solve the deepest problems, we eventually
arrive at the truth of what the real man is, and his purpose here. We
find that man's goal is knowledge, wisdom and freedom from all bondage;
that he is an Eternal Soul with all possibilities; that he can control
all the powers and forces in the universe for his own good; for health,
for

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

wealth and happiness. To reach the highest degree of attainment or
success he must stop thinking fear, doubt, disease, failure, disaster
and that sort of thing. Man, therefore, according to our philosophy, is
the greatest being that is in the universe, and this earth the best
place, because here is the greatest chance, the only chance to become
perfect. So we say always strive to improve your mind, your body, your
material wealth and your environment—be cheerful and happy, and let God
take care of the rest. When you can learn to think this way you will be
the real God-man, and the apparent-man or shadow will vanish forever.
You are then at one with the Great One, and all force and power is
yours.

#### HOW THE DEVAS (ANGELS) CAN HELP US.

Countless angels, or spirits, are ever ready to help the real man—the
brave, bold, true and courageous man—and do help him, in a way that it
would be hard to explain in a book of this scope and to the ordinary
mind. All humanity is being helped all the time by these Great Souls,
who do not live in a gross body like ours. To get their best help one
must be kind, gentle, calm and free from anger or hatred. That is the
reason you will

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

always see that all great men and women have full and complete control
of themselves and are invariably mild, kind and gentle people. You have
no idea how much good you lose when you lose control of your temper or
passion.

#### MARRIAGE BRINGS SUCCESS.

Look about you and on every hand you will observe that about all the men
and women who reach great success have a partner—a wife or husband. God
has always commanded man to marry and bring into the world children. In
selecting a wife or husband be careful to take a person on the same
social plane as yourself.

#### ABOUT WOMAN.

The Yogis have the very highest respect and the purest love for women.
We know that woman is a finer organization than man, and in India, you
never hear the Hindus of culture or refinement ever refer to woman as
the "weaker vessel." Man to reach his highest development must look up
to woman, the mother of creation, and love her with the highest and
purest love, and respect her with the highest respect. No man can become
great until

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

he has this respect for woman. Woman is the "finer vessel," and not the
"weaker vessel."

#### OCCULT SCIENCE.

In this wonderful and progressive age men and women are discovering that
the study of occult science and metaphysics is of great advantage to
them. The occult or secret powers and forces can only come to us by and
through certain studies of this nature. The reading of books on
astrology, mental science, mind reading, telepathy, etc., opens the mind
to new and fresh thought which is very helpful and inspiring.

#### POWER OF PRAYER.

Prayers when uttered in the right spirit, and which are not made with
mean or selfish motives, are always answered. If at any time you are in
great distress of mind, are burdened with troubles which seem too great
to overcome, if you will go off to some quiet place and open your heart
and mind to God, asking for light, direction or relief, He will answer
your prayer surely. Or maybe some of the Devas (angels) will hear your
appeal

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

and come and soothe you and give you gentle thoughts which will help
you. The prayer of the Yogi is always for Light, Direction and Love, and
is answered.

#### DON'T WORRY.

The strong and great man is the calm, cool, collected man who holds his
temper, who don't worry or hurry or get rattled, no matter whether
things go against him or with him. He is a giant of patience, strength
and force. Such a soul has strength and force to do things; to keep
itself in the very middle of the current of success, health and
happiness; by its magnificence and greatness it attracts all the good
elements and forces of the universe to its aid; it aspires to be good
and great and inspires all persons with love, admiration and confidence.
And right here let me quote a great scientist who says: "If the blood is
not right, the brain cannot be, for it can only be nourished by *good*
blood. The chief enemies of the brain are <span
class="smallcaps">Worry</span>, which disorganizes the human machinery;
<span class="smallcaps">Shock</span>, which paralyzes the brain. Worry
or excitement causes irregular nerve action. We call it confusion of
ideas or nervosity. Worry is the worst disease of the age."

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

#### ABOUT OUR TROUBLES.

"In trouble to be troubled is to have your trouble doubled." The only
way to overcome our troubles is to let them wear themselves out. If you
will pay no attention to them they will soon go away. People worry and
trouble much over troubles that do not come.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Of the hard and weary loads  
  ’Neath which we bend and fall,  
The troubles that do not come  
  Are the heaviest ones of all.</span>

</div>

Our thoughts make us. Thinking trouble brings trouble. Thinking good
brings good. We can make our life just what the mind thinks. Therefore,
how important it is for all of us to think rightly.

#### THE SECRET OF WEALTH.

We must first think wealth, and then use the mind to discover the true
foundation of wealth. The mind in its search for the cause of wealth
will soon discover that well-directed energy—work, is back of all
wealth. But along with this energy we

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

must have faith, hope and courage. This is a busy world, and we are
living in a wonderful age of big undertakings and great progress. At
every hand is to be seen advancement, improvement, progress, growth and
expansion. We are continually going forward, onward and upward. Nothing
stands still! There is no backward movement! The world is better and
busier to-day than it was yesterday, and will be better and busier
to-morrow than it is to-day. It is the calm, honest, thorough,
thoughtful and busy workers who make this condition of growth and
progress; not the worrying, hurrying, fretful, gloomy, morbid,
pessimistic minds who persist in looking at things through the wrong end
of the telescope. No one will be successful or feel the glorious good
times which are here to stay, unless he is hopeful and cheerful, and
willing to play the part God has assigned to him.

And now, dear friends, I have tried hard in this book to inspire you
with hope and courage, and I sincerely hope you will feel that we Yogis
dearly love you and wish you peace, joy, prosperity and happiness, and
in conclusion let me quote the saying of one of our brothers, who is a
great Yogi—a great soul: "You are all God, O ye men and O ye animals,
and living beings, ye are the manifestation of the One living God—the
Blessed One—the

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> All in All, so how
can you doubt your reaching perfection?"

May the peace and blessings of the Blessed One, and all the Devas
(angels) and all the Yogis of the Universe be ever with you, my beloved
sisters and brothers, is the prayer of

<span class="smallcaps">Bhakti Seva,</span>  
22 North William Street, New York City.
