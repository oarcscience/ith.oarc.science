### Sagittarius

### ♐

*All persons born from November* 22 *to December* 20*, inclusive, were
born under the sign of Sagittarius*.

This is the last sign of the Fire Triplicity. As this is the sign of
earnestness, honesty and frankness, I want to impress you with the fact
that the Hindu Yogis give their whole lives to doing good; that all that
I write here is for your good; I want you to be successful and happy.
The text of all our sermons and writings is "Health, Wealth and
Happiness." We try to love the world the same as God does. Naturally you
are born for grand achievement. The only things that can retard your
progress or be obstacles to your being successful would be tendencies of
doubt, fear, morbidness, impatience, dishonesty, a lack of
combativeness, a lack of hope and cheerfulness and a lack of generosity.
You must study your weak points carefully and try to break yourself of
the tendency to quickly get angered or mad with those who do not agree

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

with you. Put your whole force and energy in whatever you undertake and
know that you can succeed. You can generally accomplish what you
undertake by having the fullest faith and greatest confidence in your
ability to succeed. It is [absolutely](errata.htm#0.md) necessary for
people of your sign, of either sex, to have unbounded faith, hope and
confidence; if you are fearful of success and have any doubts about
succeeding in any undertaking you may have in mind, it would be wise for
you to abandon it, as the chances are you will not meet with success.
Work is essential to your happiness. All people of this sign who are
idle or not continually actively engaged in some pursuit are apt to be
very miserable. Rely entirely upon your own opinions and don't permit or
allow anyone to switch you off or change your mind, as your own judgment
about what to do and what not to do is far more valuable than that of
friends or acquaintances. People of this sign, both men and women, are
adapted to business, and are successful when they apply themselves to
one line. Concentrate all of your energy and powers on whatever you have
in hand, and do not take up a new undertaking until you carry the
present one to a successful end. You will be very powerful and forceful
to the extent that you combat and overcome obstacles, especially your
faults.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> You are one who
does not need to be told much about your faults, as you know them
yourself. Therefore, I will not say much about them, but leave you to
determine your weak points, and only urge you to fight with persistency
to down every low and bad tendency you may have. Your great success and
happiness will depend upon how you bring out the good and high qualities
which you naturally possess. When these are strong, and dominate your
lower nature, you will be a very charming and fascinating person. Then
in love, business, social achievements or culture, you will be
successful. People will then marvel at your wonderful magnetic and
hypnotic powers, which will make you all-powerful in influencing men and
women; in attracting and drawing to you people who can be of service to
you.

Be ever active in your own affairs, and waste no time or energy in
meddling with the affairs of others. People of this sign do many of the
great things in the world, and when educated, well read, well informed
and cultivated invariably achieve distinction and amass great fortunes.
It is well for you in your relations with men and women to be frank and
open, and always bright, cheerful and jovial. If there is anything that
people dislike it is a blue, grumbling, whining man or woman

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

who, with sorrowful or sad countenance, always has a tale of woe to
tell. People who succeed are those who are ever hopeful and cheerful and
who are always up and doing—making things happen. And that is just what
you must fix in your mind—<span class="smallcaps">I will</span> make
things happen; <span class="smallcaps">I will</span> succeed; <span
class="smallcaps">I will</span> be happy and joyful; <span
class="smallcaps">I will</span> see only the good and bright things of
this world. What this world needs is more cheerful workers, more
enterprising men and women, more progressive beings, more courageous and
combative people.

If not married, I would advise you to seriously consider the question.
Read what I say about marriage in the closing chapter of this book.

Neatness, order, attention to details, providently laying aside money
for emergencies, belong to your sign in a marked degree and are what
make so many of the Sagittarius people so wonderfully successful. They
generally understand the following words of wisdom uttered by a wise and
good man: "The way to wealth is as plain as the way to market. It
depends on two words—industry and frugality; that is, waste neither time
nor money, but make the best use of both. If you would be wealthy, think
of saving as well as getting." Poverty is a curse and must be abolished.
The Yogis of India, in a quiet and subtle way, in all of their

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

sermons, lectures and writings, inject suggestions against poverty. We
pray constantly that the Minds of men may grasp the true and high way of
acquiring money and using it wisely. We claim no great fortunes were
ever amassed dishonestly; that to acquire enormous wealth one must be
honest and wise—know how to use it wisely after getting it.

Fully developed, cultured, refined and educated, the Sagittarius people
are very intuitive, their minds constantly running ahead, and quite
accurately foretelling coming events; they become bright and brilliant
conversationalists and, all in all, a much-loved people. Lots of
reading, good, spirited music, outdoor sports, dancing and association
with learned and brilliant people is of advantage to you.

This sign is governed by Jupiter, and the gems are carbuncle, diamond
and turquoise. The astral colors are gold, red and green. The diseases
which you are most likely to suffer from are rheumatism and stomach
troubles. Your best companions are those born in Aries, Aquarius, Libra,
Virgo and in your own sign.

People born in this sign have very expressive eyes, and are active and
graceful, being swift in their movements.

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

May the peace and blessings of the Blessed One, and all the Devas
(angels) and all the Yogis of the Universe be ever with you, dear sister
or brother of Sagittarius.—*Bhakti Seva*.

#### CUSPS.

If your first breath was drawn when one sign was taking the place of
another, you will partake of the characteristics of both signs. Hence
you belong to the Cusp. The residence in a sign consists of six days;
any time less endows one with some of the qualities of the preceding
sign.

##### THE CUSP OF SCORPIO—SAGITTARIUS.

*November* 22 *to* 28.

Persons born on any of these six days are agreeable in speech and
graceful in manner, and are remarkable imitators. The conscience of
Sagittarius has a hard struggle at times with the easy moral principles
of Scorpio, but Sagittarius usually conquers.

If a native of this cusp takes up an impure or dissipated life their
descent is most rapid. They

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

make the best soldiers, surgeons and lawyers, as they are devoid of all
fear. The woman is law in her own household and severely deals with any
disobedience.

These persons require praise and consideration for their good deeds, and
if it is not given it has a marked effect on their happiness. The people
of this cusp are remarkably brilliant and capable of great learning, but
they lack patience and frequently fret themselves into the grave.

Sometimes the forces from these two signs produce a most pronounced and
disagreeable pessimist. As a rule, however, the people of these signs
are agreeable.
