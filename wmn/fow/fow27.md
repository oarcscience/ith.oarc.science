# CHAPTER XXV

### WOMAN'S BLUSHES

"From every blush that kindles in thy cheeks  
Ten thousand little loves and graces spring,  
To revel in the roses."--ROWE, Tamerlane.

PERHAPS one of the most charming characteristics of maidenhood is its
transient blush, which poets with all their wealth of poetic imagery
have depicted in a thousand pretty ways, so often described by them as
playing on the cheeks with all the roseate hue of loveliness, and what
more graceful picture can there be than Gay has given us:--

"The rising blushes which her cheek o'erspread,  
Are opening roses in the lily's bed."

Such Shakesperian expressions as "Bid the cheek ready with a blush,
modest as morning," "Thy cheeks blush with pure shame to counterfeit our
roses," and "To blush and beautify the cheek again," would seem to
suggest the high charm blushes had for Shakespeare; although, on the
other hand, expressions like the following must be held to imply a very
different meaning--"Her blush is gluttiness, not modesty," and "Blushing
cheeks by faults are bred, and fears by white shown." But, however
numerous the diverse views of this kind may be--many of which have been
embodied in proverbial literature--there can be no doubt that the
consensus of opinion, both at home and abroad, has always been in favour
of a woman's blush, for, in accordance with the time-honoured adage,
"Blushing is virtue's colour."

Even the Circassian women who are capable of blushing fetch a higher
price in the seraglio of the Sultan than less susceptible women; and
Darwin quotes from Humboldt an adage of the Spaniard, "How can those be
trusted who know not how to blush?"

Indeed, it has been observed, she who has lost the art of blushing has
lost the most powerful charm of beauty, for deprived of her most
maidenly blushes what would Parnell's beauty have been:--

"A crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread,  
Varying her cheeks, by turn, with white and red;  
The driving colours, never at a stay,  
Run here and there, and flush, and fade away."

But the Italians have a proverb, which is often applied to those who mar
their features by artificial colouring, "Women rouge that they may not
blush." As might be expected, all kinds of strange views have at one
time or another been held in most countries respecting blushing, some of
the explanations not always being very complimentary to the fair sex.
Thus, according to one popular fancy, it is supposed to be an indication
of conscious deceit, and in the "Passionate Pilgrim," we find this
allusion to blushing, which under one form or another has been variously
expressed:--

"Yet will she blush, here be it said,  
To hear her secrets so betrayed."

Pope writes, "Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame;" but George
Eliot, in "Daniel Deronda," speaks somewhat disparagingly of the blush,
which she says "is no language; only a dubious flag-signal, which may
mean either of two contradictions;" and Moore speaks of--

"Playful blushes that seem nought  
But luminous escapes of thought."

It has long been a much disputed question--and one which does not seem
altogether to have been satisfactorily answered--as to whether blushing
takes place in the dark, an interesting correspondence relative to which
was carried on a few years back in the pages of Notes and Queries, when
Mr. J. C. Galton expressed his opinion in the negative.

Darwin, however, appears to have thought differently, for, in his
"Expressions of the Emotions," he thus alludes to this subject:--

"The fact that blushes may be excited in absolute solitude seems opposed
to the view, namely, that the habit originally arose from thinking about
what others think of us. Several ladies who are great blushers, are
unanimous in regard to solitude, and some of them believe that they have
blushed in the dark. From what Mr. Forbes has stated with regard to the
Aymaras, and from my own sensations, I have no doubt that this latter
statement is correct. Shakespeare, therefore, erred when he made Juliet,
who was not even by herself, say to Romeo (act ii. sc. 2):--

"'Thou know'st the mark of night is on my face;  
Else would a maiden's blush bedeck my cheek,  
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.'"
