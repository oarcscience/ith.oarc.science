# CHAPTER XII

### RED-HAIRED GIRLS

"The gold and topaz of the sun on snow  
Are shade by the bright hair above those eyes."  
PETRARCH.

WHY red hair has been at a discount in all ages has perplexed many a
chronicler of fashion. Although, it is true, artists have more
chivalrously depicted its beauty, the reverse is the case in literature.
What poet, it may be asked, has ventured to sing of "the fair one with
the ruddy ringlets" in the same way as the charms of the dark-haired
maiden have been so often described?

Whereas the jetty ringlet or flaxen plait has won a thousand admirers,
the red-haired girl has found herself persistently passed by. However
good and attractive her features, and however graceful her gait may be,
she has rarely found her praises acknowledged. Fashion, hitherto, has
boycotted in a most unrelenting manner the girl with hair of reddish
hue; and, despite the fact that in years gone by many beautiful women
possessed tresses of this unaristocratic colour, it still remains
unpopular.

It is useless to urge in its favour that Queen Elizabeth considered
herself to make the best appearance when wearing a red wig, and that
others, counting themselves stars of fashion, have been of the same
opinion; for there is a deep-rooted and unaccountable prejudice against
this much-abused shade of colour, which it is quite possible some
unexpected freak of fashion may one day change. Indeed, from time
immemorial, the girl so endowed by Nature has been, in most places, open
to sarcasm, and rude unsympathetic passers-by have contemptuously spoken
of "carrots" by way of a joke. An old epigram running thus:--

"Why scorn red hair? The Greeks, we know  
(I note it here in Charity),  
Had taste in beauty, and with them  
The Graces were all 'Charital.'"

For years past barbers have advertised various compositions for altering
the red shade of the hair, and some time ago a high German doctor and
astrologer informed the public that he was blessed with a wife "who
could make red hair as white as a lily."

A lady whose lover had an unconquerable antipathy to red hair once
applied to a noted quack for help in her emergency, who politely
answered:--"This is no business of mine, but my wife's, who'll soon
redress your grievances and furnish you with a leaden comb, and my
anti-Erythraean unguent, which after two or three applications will make
you as fair, or as brown, as you please." According to an American
newspaper paragraph, twenty-one men in Cincinnati, who had married
red-haired women, were found to be colour blind, thus mistaking red for
black.

But, going back to the antecedent history of this strange prejudice, it
may be traced to a very early period. The Ancient Egyptians, for
instance, seem to have been pre-eminent among all nations for their
aversion to red-haired people. According to early authorities they were
in the habit of annually performing the ceremony of burning alive an
unfortunate individual whose only crime was the colour of his hair.
"Fancy," as it has been remarked, "the state of mind into which every
possessor of the obnoxious shade must have been thrown at the approach
of the dreaded ceremony, each not knowing who might be selected as the
victim."

From the epithets "red-haired barbarians" and "red-haired devils," with
which the Chinese were formerly in the habit of designating the English,
it is evident that with them a similar strong antipathy prevailed to
this unfortunate, and ill-omened, colour of the hair.

On the other hand, the Romans, from the days of Nero to the present,
have been unstinted in their praise of red hair--with the old Romans the
colour more esteemed being a dark red, almost brown. Modern Romans, it
is said, inherit "the tastes of their ancestors in this respect; and
nowhere else on the face of the earth are so many red-haired women to be
found as among the patrician families of Rome and Florence. The same
liking exists among modern Greeks, who strive to accentuate the
burnished effect of their reddish tresses by the wearing of dull gold
ornaments."

The Laura whom Petrarch has immortalised attracted him by the colour of
her tresses. He first saw her in church clad in a mantle of green, over
which her golden red hair fell, which inspired him to write these
lines:--

"The snare was set amidst those threads of gold  
To which Love bound me fast,"

and in another of his songs he says of his lady-love's hair--

"The gold and topaz of the sun on snow  
Are shade by the bright hair above those eyes."

Spanish artists look with no favour on a redhaired woman, and for two
reasons. First, because red hair is in direct opposition to that of the
Castilian women, who form the class ideal of feminine beauty to the
people of that country. The second reason may be attributed to the old
tradition which has led them always to portray Judas as a man with red
hair. The same prejudice prevails in France, and Thiers, in his
"Histoire des Perruques," gives this as one of the reasons for wearing a
wig:--"Les rousseaux porterent des perruques pour cacher la couleur de
leur cheveux, qui sont en horreur a tout le monde, parceque Judas, a ce
qu'on prétend étoit rousseau." Hence there is an old French adage to
this effect:--

"Homme roux et femme barbe,  
Da trente pas loin le salue,  
Avecques trois pierres au poing,  
Pour t'en aider a ton besoign."

In our own country, the literature of past years contains many similar
allusions. In "As You Like It," Rosalind, speaking of Orlando, says "His
very hair is of the dissembling colour;" whereupon Celia replies,
"Something browner than Judas's." Southey, in his "Vision of the Maid of
Orleans," after having taken the poor girl to a number of unpleasant
places, introduces her to the following disagreeable personage:--

"From thence they came  
Where, in the next ward, a most wretched band  
Groaned underneath the bitter tyranny  
Of a fierce demon. His coarse hair was red,  
Pale grey his eyes, and bloodshot, and his face  
Wrinkled with such a smile as malice wears  
In ecstasy."

This demon, of course, is Cruelty, into whose charge are committed all
those who have been guilty of cruelty in their lifetime. Shirley, in his
"Doubtful Heir," expresses the same idea, as also does Dryden, in his
play of "Amboyna." Middleton, too, in his "Chaste Maid of Cheapside,"
has a similar allusion, showing how popular and widespread was the
prejudice to this unfortunate colour; indeed, so much so, that there is
some raason to think that the devil himself had occasionally this
attribute bestowed upon him.

The Brahmins were forbidden to marry a red-haired woman; and, as it has
been remarked, "the populace of most countries, confounding moral with
aesthetic impressions, accuses red-haired people of various
shortcomings." Hence, superstition has assigned to hair of a coppery
tinge, when it adorns a woman's head, the worst traits; and "all the
petty vices, all the lamentable shortcomings to which femininity is heir
have been laid to the charge of the reddish crown." Of course this is
only prejudice; and as the author of the "Ugly Girl Papers" writes, "I
have seen a most obnoxious head of colour so changed by a few years'
care that it became the admiration of the owner's friends, and could
hardly be recognised as the withered, fiery locks once worn." At the
same time there seems some truth in the common opinion that a red-haired
girl is invariably self-conscious; for she knows that her hair, although
it may not be of a fiery carrot colour, is the subject of daily comment.

Referring to the colour of the hair in folk-lore, we may note that from
time immemorial there has been a strong antipathy to red hair, which,
according to some antiquarians, originated in a tradition that Judas had
hair of this colour. One reason, it has been suggested, why the dislike
to it arose was that it was considered ugly and unfashionable, and on
this account a person with red hair would soon be regarded with
contempt. It has been conjectured, too, that the odiuu took its rise
from the aversion to the red-haired Danes.

Yellow hair was, also, in years gone by, regarded with ill-favour, and
almost esteemed a deformity, allusions to which prejudice are of
constant occurrence; and, it may be added, that hair was often used
metaphorically for the colour, complexion, or nature of a thing, as in
Beaumont and Fletcher's "The Nice Valour"--

"A lady of my hair cannot want pitying."
