# CHAPTER I

### WOMAN'S CHARACTERISTICS

It is only a woman that can make a man become the parody of
himself.--French Proverb.

PROVERBIAL philosophy has long agreed that woman is a complex creature,
little understood, and, according to Michelet, "she is a miracle of
Divine contradictions;" an opinion endorsed by Pope, who in his "Moral
Essays," writes, "Woman's at best a contradiction still;" and, further,
by Richter, who says, "A woman is the most inconsistent compound of
obstinacy and self-sacrifice that I am acquainted with." The wisest
sages from the earliest period have been forced to admit that he would
be a truly clever man who could understand, and account for, the many
and varied characteristics of womankind, for, as Lord Byron wrote:--

"What a strange thing is man! And what a stranger  
Is woman! What a whirlwind is her head!  
And what a whirlpool, full of depth and danger,  
Is all the rest about her! Whether wed  
Or widow, maid or mother, she can change her  
Mind like the wind; whatever she has said  
Or done, is light to what she shall say or do--  
The oldest thing on record, and yet new."

And yet it is universally acknowledged that woman is indispensable to
man's happiness and well-being, for, as it is said in Germany, "Man
without woman is head without body, woman without man is body without
head," which corresponds with the French adage, "Without woman the two
extremes of life would be without help, and the middle of it without
pleasure;" and, long ago, the Egyptians were wont to represent a man
without a woman by a single millstone, which cannot grind alone. The
Burmese, too, of to-day maintain that "of all beings woman is most
excellent; she is the chief of supporters;" and, according to another of
their proverbial maxims, "her intelligence is four times that of man,
her assiduity six times, and her desires eight times." Eastern proverbs
are highly complimentary to women; for whereas, says a Sanskrit adage,
"they are instructed by nature, the learning of men is taught by books;"
or, as another piece of Oriental wisdom reminds us, "Nature is woman's
teacher, and she learns more sense than  
man, the pedant, gleams from books." And, in short, the power and
influence of woman have been admirably described by Thomas Otway in his
"Venice Preserved" (act i. sc. I):--

"O woman! lovely woman! Nature made thee  
To temper man; we had been brutes without you.  
Angels are painted fair to look like you"--

which is somewhat at variance with a popular Russian proverb to the
effect that "the man is head of the woman, but she rules him by her
temper;" and with the Spanish maxim, "A woman's counsel is not much, but
he that despises it is a fool;" and again, with the Hindustani proverb,
"Woman is wise when too late." But it would appear that, in summing up
the characteristics of woman, proverbial lore, taken as a whole, is far
more favourably disposed to her good points than the reverse, as is
clearly the case with that of our French neighbours, who, long ago, have
freely admitted the power of her influence in the world. Thus we are
told that "women can do everything, because they rule those who command
everything;" and "Women are the extreme, they are either better or worse
than men;" and, again, it is said, "The world is the book of
women"--Kashmiri proverb truly maintaining that "One woman is wealth to
you, another ruination."

Woman has often been said to be equal to any emergency, a German saying
expressing this idea thus: "Though an elephant and a tiger come she will
leap over them;" and Hindustani lore waxes eloquent on this point--"What
cannot a woman do? What cannot the ocean contain? What cannot the fire
burn? What cannot death destroy?"

Most Oriental proverbs are much to the same effect, and it is said that
"None know the wily tricks of a woman; they will kill their husbands,
and then burn themselves," in order to prove their innocence; and again
we are told, "Women's wills and thieves' tricks cannot be fathomed." And
an old Welsh proverb warns us against the artifices of womankind, for--

"Nothing earthly hath a way  
Like a woman to betray;"

and Hindustani lore tells us that "Womankind is perfidious;" and much to
the same purport is the Assamese saying--

Of women, Miris, the parrot, and the crow,  
The minds of these four you cannot know;"

for the Assamese never trust women; and not very complimentary is the
Hindu saying, "My lady drops a spark in the chaff, and stands off to see
the fun." Another common notion, underlying the proverbial lore relating
to women, is their meanness--an amusing illustration of which may be
quoted from Hindustani maxims, one of which runs thus: "Three cakes of a
pennyweight each, and all her friends to eat them." But the reason for
this frequent trait of character has been assigned to a woman's
proverbial love of money, for--

"Nothing agreeth worse  
Than a lady's heart and a beggar's purse."

But, it must be remembered, another proverb tells us that--

"Weal and women cannot pan  
But woe and women can"--

"pan" being equivalent to harmonise.

Proverbial philosophy is full of warning against forming hastily an
estimate of women's character, for, as the German adage runs, "He must
have keen eyes that would know a maid at sight." We are further told
that a woman should be seen at home, when engaged in her household
duties, to form a clear estimate of her character; and the Danish
proverb inculcates this rule: "You must judge a maiden at the kneading
trough, and not at the dance."

That two women seldom keep friends for long without quarrelling has long
been proverbial, and a Tamil adage remarks that "A thousand men may live
together in harmony, whereas two women are unable to do so though they
be sisters." And the many ailments to which, under one form or another,
women are supposed to be susceptible, have been incorporated into many a
proverb like the following: "A mill, a clock, and a woman, always want
mending."

It has long been said that there is no accounting for a woman's tastes,
and, according to an old English proverb, "A black man is a jewel in a
fair woman's eyes;" and, vice versa, we are told that "A black woman
hath turpentine in her," a belief which has been told in various ways,
an old proverbial phrase quoted by Hazlitt giving this advice--

"To a red man read thy read;  
With a brown man break thy bread;  
At a pale man draw thy knife,  
From a black man keep thy wife"--

in illustration of which he gives the subjoined note from Tofte's
translation of Varchi's "Blazon of Jealousie" (1615, P. 21):--"The
Persians were wont to be so jealous of their wives, as they never
suffered them to go abroad but in waggons close shut, but at this day
the Italian is counted the man that is most subject to this vice, the
sallow-complexioned fellow with a black beard, being he that is most
prone, as well to suspect, as to be suspected about women's matters,
according to the old saying."

It would seem that, in early times, the fair sex were supposed to have
the greater charms, and accordingly they were styled, "Children of the
Gods" by the Greeks. In "As You Like it" (act iii. sc. 5), the
Shepherdess Phoebe complains of being scorned on account of her being
dark--

"I have more cause to hate him than to love him:  
For what had he to do to chide at me?  
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:  
And, now I am remember'd, scorned at me."

Indeed, as a writer has observed in the Saturday Review, the time was
when the black-haired, black-eyed girl of fiction was as dark of soul as
of tresses, while the blue-eyed maiden's character was of "Heaven's own
colour." But Thackeray changed this tradition by invariably making his
dark heroines nice, his fair heroines "treacherous sirens." Another item
of folk-lore tells us that--

"A brown wench in face  
Shows that nature gives her grace,"

and many of our country peasantry still affirm that "a too brown lass is
gay and cleanly;" whilst, in accordance with an old proverbial rhyme--

"The red is wise, the brown trusty,  
The pale envious, the dark lusty."

Dr. Paul Topinard, in his "Anthropology," has made an interesting
summary of the variation of the colour of the skin, from the fairest
Englishwoman to the darkest African, furnishing us with numerous
examples of the many hues which form the distinguishing marks of
different nationalities. These are interesting if only as showing how
widely one country differs from another in its notion as to what
constitutes beauty in the complexion. And, turning to uncultured tribes,
Dr. Letourneau has given some curious illustrations in his "Sociology"
on this point, which show how vastly different are their conceptions of
beauty of complexion, some races even disfiguring themselves with
pigments of the most glaring colours.

French proverbial wisdom in further enumerating the main features of a
woman's character, says that her heart is a real mirror, which "reflects
every object without attaching itself to any;" and in Germany, whilst
due praise is bestowed on the fair sex, women's varied traits of
character have not escaped criticism--one very common maxim affirming
that "she is at the mercy of circumstances just as the sand is at the
mercy of the wind;" whilst we are further told that, although "woman
reads and studies endlessly, her thought is always an afterthought." The
Russian is of the same opinion, for, according to him, "a woman's hair
is long, but her sense short," and "a dog is wiser than a woman, he does
not bark at his master." Tamil proverbial wisdom declares that "the
skill of a woman only goes so far as the fireplace"--in other words,
cleverness is no use to a woman outside domestic affairs; and the not
very complimentary old English adage says, "When an ass climbs a ladder,
we may find wisdom in a woman;" whilst another old saying runs, "She
hath less beauty than her picture, and truly not much more wit."

In some instances, we find the essential requirements needed to make a
good woman laid down, as in an excellent Chinese proverb, which runs
thus: "We ask four things for a woman--that virtue dwell in her heart,
modesty in her forehead, sweetness in her mouth, and labour in her
hands;" with which may be compared a well-known Sanskrit maxim, "The
beauty of the cuckoo is the voice, of women chastity; of the deformed
learning, and of ascetics patience." On the other hand, under a variety
of forms, proverbial literature inculcates the necessity of our
remembrance of these four evils thus summed up in the Italian warning:
"From four things God preserve us--painted woman, a conceited valet,
salt beef without mustard, and a little late dinner." A similar idea is
conveyed in the Assamese proverb: "To be the husband of a worthless
woman, a cart covering with a hole in the middle of it, a hired
weaver--these three are the agony of death." To understand this proverb
it must be remembered that "in Assam the bullock cart is covered with a
hood made of matting, with bamboo hoops to support it. Any one who has
travelled in a bullock cart with a hole in the hood will appreciate its
truth."

A trait of character, however, which women are proverbially said to
their disadvantage to possess, is a lack of truth and reliability; and,
according to an old proverb, "He who takes an eel by the tail, or a
woman at her word, soon finds he holds nothing." The popular adage which
warns a man not to trust a woman further than he can see her has been
variously expressed, one version in Germany being "Arms, women, and
books should be looked at daily;" and, according to another, it is said,
"Beware of a bad woman, and put no trust in a good one;" which are
similar to the Hindustani adage, "A hare and a woman are yours while in
your power." The Italians have a maxim to the same effect, "Woman always
speak the truth, but not the whole truth," and hence there are the
frequent admonitions against trusting womankind, for the French affirm
that "he who trusts a woman and leads an ass will never be free from
plague;" and, similarly, it is said, "The ruses of women multiply with
their years;" and where truth is deficient in a woman there can be no
reliance in her word, for, as the Chinese affirm, "An untruthful woman
is rotten grass and tangled hemp." But, unreliable as a woman at times
may be, we cannot endorse the Turkish maxim, "The dog is faithful, woman
never;" which is not unlike the Kashmiri proverb: "A horse, a wife, and
a sword, these three are unfaithful;" and Hindu proverbial literature,
speaking of woman's insincerity, says that "while the wife is eating her
husband's food, she is inwardly singing the praises of her mother."

On the other hand, in defence of woman, it has been urged that
good-nature and simplicity of character are liable to imposition, for,
as it is commonly said, "All lay load on the winning horse," a version
of which is to be found among Sindhi proverbs "A mild-faced woman has
her cheeks pulled." We may further compare our own proverbs: "She is as
quiet as a wasp in one's nose," and "She looks as if butter would not
melt in her mouth;" and, again, "A gentle housewife mars the
household"--in other words, through her leniency there is "a want of
discipline."

An amusing phrase to denote a proud woman is this, "She holds up her
head like a hen drinking water;" and when Herefordshire folk speak of a
strong, robust girl, the remark may still occasionally be heard, "She
hath one point of a good hawk, she is hardy." When a girl simpers and
puts on an affected appearance, in such a way as to excite ridicule and
amusement, she is still, in old proverbial phraseology, said to "simper
as a mare when she eats thistles," or to "simper like a furmity kettle."
An indolent girl is described as "having broken her elbow," and the
phrase applied to a woman who grows inactive after marriage is, "She
hath broken her elbow at the church-door." The same idea, again, is
conveyed in the adage, "She had rather kiss than spin," implying that
many a young girl, instead of being industrious at home, would much
sooner gad about and play with love; and, if this be not in her power,
to use a Somersetshire phrase, "She is as crusty as that is hard-baked."

Chastity, to which references will be found in ensuing chapters, has
been universally regarded as an essential necessity for a good woman,
for as a popular proverb, current under a variety of forms in most
countries, enjoins, "An immodest woman is food without salt;" and a
Chinese maxim tells its that "modesty is a woman's courage;" whereas
Tacitus wrote in his day, "When a woman has lost her character, she will
shrink from no crime." And, where this trait of character is wanting,
the consensus of opinion seems to be that no amount of care, or
foresight, will prevent a woman going astray; for a Kural saying, too,
teaches much the same lesson

"Of what avail are prisons barred,  
Their chastity is women's guard."

And a Malay proverb emphasises the tenacity of a woman's purpose,
whether that be good or bad--

"A whole herd of buffaloes might be shut up in a pen,  
There is one thing not to be guarded--a woman."

Much to the same effect is the Eastern proverb, "Women, if confined at
home by faithful guardians, are not really guarded; but those women who
guard themselves by their own will, are well guarded," to which may be
added the German adages: "A sackful of fleas is easier to watch than a
woman," and "A woman and a glass are always in danger;" whilst the old
English proverbial phrase, "She will stay at home, perhaps, if her leg
be broken," implies that nothing but what happens through compulsion
will keep many a woman at home. Indeed, it has always been held that
there is no compensation for the lack of chastity in a woman, an old
Tamil maxim declaring that "beauty without chastity is a flower without
fragrance."

On the other hand, an Arabic proverb says that "The modest woman's walk
lasts from morning till evening," which has been thus explained, "The
modest woman rarely goes out, or meets any one, and, when she does get
the opportunity to go out, she is as delighted with the various sights
as if she were a stranger, and she spends a long time in looking at
them, and in chatting with those of her intimate friends whom she meets,
so that the length of her absence from the house has become proverbial."

Lastly, due consideration for the frailty of woman is extensively
enjoined in proverbial lore, a Tamil adage telling us that "though you
see a woman sin with your own eyes, cover it over with earth," for, it
adds, "if she says, I am a woman, even the devil will have compassion on
her;" and hence a person is sternly warned "not to dare to stand on the
earth when passing unjust remarks on a woman." A German proverb says,
"Frailty, thy name is woman," which is to the same effect as the Eastern
aphorism, "Women, like flowers, are of tender fabric, and should be
softly handled;" which coincides with the Indian maxim, "Do not strike,
even with a flower, a woman guilty of a hundred crimes," and with the
Hindustani proverb, "It is not right to lift one's hand to a woman."

At the same time, our forefathers were strongly of opinion that a
certain amount of correction was good for women, an opinion to which we
have referred in our chapter on "Woman's Goodness," where we have given
some of the proverbial wisdom on the subject. Among Oriental proverbs
too much leniency is deprecated, it being said that "the petted boy
becomes a gambler, and the petted girl a wanton," which is similar to
the Marathi maxim, "By the mother's petting the child becomes an idiot;"
and to our own proverbs "A child may have too much of his mother's
blessing," and "Mothers' darlings make but milk-sop heroes;" for, says
Ray, "Mothers are oftentimes too tender and fond of their children, who
are ruined and spoiled by their indulgence." In Hindustani lore we find
the same idea expressed, a familiar adage maintaining that, "Melons
require the sun, and mangoes want the sun; women need a strong hand, and
children want love." The reason for this would seem to be that a woman
does not always know what is best for  
her, hence the Welsh adage:--

"A woman mostly will prefer  
The thing that is the worst for her."

And hence, as the Italians say, "Women, apes, and nuts require strong
hands." There is an African proverb which says that "a man is not obeyed
by his wife in his own house," which, we are told, implies that she does
not consider him her husband "unless he beat her, thwack"--a mode of
treatment which, it is needless to say, would not be endured by the
wives of the West.
