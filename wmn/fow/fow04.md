# CHAPTER II

### WOMAN'S BEAUTY

"She's beautiful and therefore to be wooed;  
She is a woman, therefore to be won."  
1st Henry VI. act v. sc. 3.

"A BEAUTIFUL woman," remarked Napoleon, "pleases the eye, a good woman
pleases the heart; one is a jewel, the other a treasure." It is not
surprising that the beauty of woman--in praise of which both literature
and art have from the earliest period lavished some of their grandest
works--should have given rise in most countries to a host of strange and
romantic fancies. Many of these survive in our midst to-day, and,
although experience has long proved how unreliable such beliefs are,
they still retain their hold on the popular mind, often causing
unnecessary prejudice and fear.

It is a very old notion, for instance, that beauty is unfortunate; and,
according to an old Italian proverb, "Over the greatest beauty hangs the
greatest ruin." Allusions to this piece of folk-lore are not only found
in the poetry and romance of bygone centuries, but are of frequent
occurrence in the literature of modern times. Thus Goethe makes Helena
affirm that beauty and happiness remain not long united and Byron, in
his "Childe Harold" (iv. 42), speaks of "the fatal gift of beauty." We
may recall, too, Lord Tennyson's charming and pathetic language in "A
Dream of Fair Women," where he relates how--

"In every land  
  I saw, wherever light illumineth,

Beauty and anguish walking hand in hand  
  The downward slope to death.

Those far-renowned brides of ancient song  
  Peopled the hollow dark, like burning stars,

And I heard sounds of insult, shame, and wrong,  
  And trumpets blown for wars."

And there is a well-known passage where Fielding, in his "Journey from
this World to the Next," (chap. vi.), thus writes: "She--Fortune--was
one of the most deformed females I ever beheld, nor could I help
observing the frowns she expressed when any beautiful spirit of her own
sex passed her, nor the affability that smiled on her countenance on the
approach of any handsome male spirits. Hence I accounted for the truth
of an observation I had often made on earth, that nothing is more
fortunate than handsome men, nor more unfortunate than handsome women;"
such, too, was the opinion of the host of the "Canterbury Tales" who
bewailed the sad fate of Virginia related by the Doctor of Physic:--

"Allas! too deare boughte sshe her beauté,  
Wherefore I say, that alle men may se,  
That giftes of fortune, or of nature,  
Ben cause of deth of many a creature.  
Her beaute was hir deth, I dar well sayn,  
Allas! so piteously as she was slayn."

And there is the old mythical tale which tells how Medusa was a maiden
of such beauty as to provoke the jealousy of Minerva, wherefore she was
transformed into a frightful monster. Her much-admired ringlets became
hissing serpents, and no living thing could look upon her without being
turned into stone. Legendary lore provides us with many stories of this
kind, which illustrates Patterson's well-known lines:--

"O fatal beauty! why art thou bestowed  
On hapless woman still to make her wretched?  
Betrayed by thee, how many are undone!"

Chinese folk-lore maintains that beautiful women are unlucky, one of
their many proverbs on the subject declaring that "fair maidens are very
unlucky, and clever young men have little beauty." It was also supposed
that feminine beauty of unusual merit was fatal to long life, and no
subject has been more popular with the novelist, or poet, than the
gradual fading away of some young girl gifted in a high degree with good
looks.

Lord Tennyson, in his "May Queen," has interwoven this idea, and it is
found scattered here and there in the literature of most countries.
Hence, another reason why beauty has been regarded as unfortunate is
owing to its being thought prejudicial to health, a variation of which
belief occurs in "Richard III." (act iii. sc. i), where the Duke of
Gloucester says:--

"So wise, so young, they say do never live long."

Another misfortune connected with beauty is its evanescence, and, as the
German proverbs run, "Woman's beauty, the forest echo and rainbows, soon
pass away," and "Maidens and roses soon lose their bloom." And the same
truth is conveyed in the Hindustani proverb, "The spring in which he saw
the blossoms is gone, now, O bee, only the thorns remain on the rose;"
another version of which is, "My fair one don't be proud of your
complexion, it is the guest of but a few days." Poets have largely dwelt
on beauty's transient character, and Shakespeare, in "The Passionate
Pilgrim," says:--

"Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good;  
A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly;  
A flower that dies when first it 'gins to bud,  
A brittle glass that's broken presently,  
A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,  
Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour."

And the oft-quoted adage that "Beauty is like an almanac; if it last a
year it is well," reminds us of Moliér's lines in his "Les Feminies
Savantes":--

"La beauté du visage est un frele ornement,  
Une fleur passagére, un éclat d'un moment,  
Et qui n'est attache qu' a la simple epiderne."

The snares of beauty have been made from early times the subject of much
proverbial wisdom, a Servian adage affirming that, "Better sometimes a
woman blind than one too beautiful;" for, as the Italian proverb adds,
"Tell a woman that she is beautiful, and the devil will repeat it to her
ten times;" with which may be compared an old Welsh proverb, which has
been translated thus:--

"Three things may make a woman nought  
A giddy brain,  
A heart that's vain,  
A face in beauty's fashion wrought;"

and the German proverb adds, "An impudent face never marries." There is,
too, the old English adage, "The fairest silk is soon stained;" for, as
Ray has said, "The handsomest women are soonest corrupted, because they
are most tempted."

Although we cannot endorse the old German proverb which says that,
"Every woman would be rather pretty than pious," yet most women are
mightily proud of their beauty, for, as an early English maxim reminds
us, "She that is born a beauty is born married;" another version of
which we find in an old work entitled, "New Help to Discourse" (1721, P.
134), "Beauty draws more than five yoke of oxen;" with which we may

compare Pope's lines in "The Rape of the Lock" (Canto ii.):--

"Fair tresses man's imperial race insnare,  
And beauty draws us with a single hair."

The same idea occurs in French proverbial lore, but it is thus
qualified:--

"Amour fait beaucoup  
Mais argent fait tout;"

and according to German proverbial lore, "Beauty is a good letter of
introduction," and, "Good looks are an inheritance," and again, "A
pretty face is a good drummer;" but, on the other hand, it is said, "A
poor beauty finds more lovers than husbands."

It is not surprising that in all ages women have striven to preserve
their beauty, however transient it may be, for, as it has been remarked,
"it is valueless to a woman to be young unless pretty, or to be pretty
unless young;" and an amusing story is told of an old queen who, day
after day, sighed with longing regret that her beauty had vanished, and
that her young days were gone. In this sad dilemma she was advised to
try some magic restorative to bring back the rosy blush of youth, and
accordingly--

"Of rosmayr she took six pounde,  
And grounde it well into a stownde,"

and then she mixed with it water, in which she bathed three times a day,
taking care to anoint her head with "gode balme afterwards." In a few
days her old withered face fell away, and she became so young and pretty
that she began to look out for a husband.

But, unfortunately, stories of this class belong to the domain of
fairyland, or, otherwise, old age would have a bad time of it, for every
woman would remain young if not beautiful. At any rate, there is no
disguising the fact that the human brain has done its very best to
accommodate the fair sex with the charm of juvenescence, judging from
the rules laid down for this purpose; a popular folk-rhyme advising us
thus:--

"Those who wish to be fair and stout,  
Must wash their faces with the disclout;  
Those who wish to be wrinkled and grey,  
Must keep the disclout far away."

The common wayside flower, the lady's mantle, was once in great repute
with ladies; for, according to Hoffman, it had the power of "restoring
feminine beauty, however faded, to its early freshness;" and the wild
tansy, laid to soak in buttermilk for nine days, had the reputation of
"making the complexion very fair." The hawthorn, again, was in high
repute among the fair sex, for according to an old piece of proverbial
lore:--

"The fair maid who, the first of May,  
Goes to the fields at break of day,  
And washes in dew from the hawthorn-tree,  
Will ever after handsome be";

and the common fumitory "was used when gathered in wedding hours and
boiled in water, milk, and whey, as a wash for the complexion of rustic
maids."

Various allusions to these old recipes occur in the literature of the
past, and we find the Earl of Shrewsbury--who had charge of the
unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots--making an application for an increased
allowance on account of her expensive habit of bathing in wine. Those
who could not afford such an extravagant luxury contented themselves
with milk-baths, which were all the fashion in the reign of Charles II.

Great importance, too, has long been attached to what is popularly
nicknamed "Beauty Sleep," it being supposed that the two hours' sleep
before midnight are worth all that comes after it, and are far more
instrumental in keeping off wrinkles than all the cosmetics and
expedients to which we have just referred, the faintest indication of
which is a killing blow to womankind. Hence it is not surprising that,
in the words of a Portuguese proverb, the marriageable young lady cries
in despair, "marry me, mother, for my face is growing wrinkled." The
explanation given by Ray of the value of the so-called beauty-sleep is
amusing: "For the sun being the light of this sublunary world, whose
heat causes the motion of all terrestrial animals, when he is farthest
off, that is about midnight, the spirits of themselves are aptest to
rest and compose, so that the middle of the night must needs be the most
proper time to sleep in, especially if we consider the greater expense
of spirits in the daytime, partly by the heat of the afternoon, and
partly by labour, and the constant exercise of all the senses; whereof
then to wake is put the spirits in motion, when there are fewest of
them, and they naturally most sluggish and unfit for it."

But it is generally acknowledged that the attempt to cheat time of his
wrinkles has nearly always proved fruitless, and only too frequently
"the would-be fair ones have been driven in despair to conceal what they
found it impossible to remove, and hence the feminine fashion of
bedaubing the complexion with artificial tints, a custom which it may be
remembered was almost universal among Grecian women."

On the other hand, however much fortune may be reputed to be hostile to
beauty, good looks have been termed "a woman's glory," and Galen perhaps
was not far wrong in maintaining that one reason why misfortune is so
often connected with beauty is that "many who have been distinguished
for their loveliness have neglected the education of their mind," for,
as the German proverbs say, "Beauty and understanding go rarely
together;" "Beauty is but dross if honesty be lost," and there is the
Tamil adage, "Beauty in the unworthy is poison in a casket of gold."
Some, like Ralph Nickleby, may disparage a woman's beauty, but, as it
has been remarked, one reason why beauty has been coveted by most women
is partly owing to the early belief that a lovely face was the outward
indication that a person so adorned was gifted with an equally beautiful
soul within. It was long and extensively believed that a lofty soul
could not dwell in an ugly casket, and hence a beautiful woman was
commonly credited with having a fine and noble character, a notion which
in only too many instances history alone has refuted, for, as an old
proverb says, "Beauty may have fair leaves, but little fruit." This once
popular belief, however, was a favourite one with the poets, and is
referred to in the "Tempest," (act i. sc. 2):--

"There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:  
If the ill Spirit have so fair a house,  
Good things strive to dwell with't."

And Young alludes to the same idea in these well-known lines:--

"What's female beauty, but an air divine,  
Through which the mind's all gentle graces shine?  
They, like the sun, irradiate all between,  
The body charms, because the soul is seen,  
Hence men are often captives of a face  
They know not why, of no peculiar grace.  
Some forms, though bright, no mortal man can bear,  
Some, none resist, though not exceeding fair."

Moralists and others have largely dwelt on this familiar idea, and, in
one form or another, it has prevailed in most countries, and has been
incorporated in many a legendary romance; an item of folk-lore which Sir
A. de Vere Hunt has thus prettily expressed:--

"What is beauty? not the show  
Of shapely limbs and features--no!  
These are but flowers  
That have their dated hours  
To breathe their momentary sweets, then go.  
'Tis the stainless soul within,  
That outshines the fairest skin."

There would appear, however, to be an exception to this rule, for German
folk-wisdom tells us that "A fair skin often covers a crooked mind," and
"A fair face may hide a foul heart," which reminds us of the whited
sepulchres of the New Testament; and it is further said in Germany that
"Falseness often lurks beneath fair hair," and there is the Spanish
proverb, "A handsome woman is either silly or vain."

But notions of beauty fortunately differ, and, according to a popular
adage, "What is one man's meat is another man's poison;" and, whatever
truth there may be in the proverb which reminds us that "Beauty is but
skin deep," there is no denying that personal appearance has made all
the difference in the estimation formed by one person of another.
According to an old folk-rhyme we are told that:--

A fair face is half a portion,  
A fair face may be a foul bargain,  
A fair face may hide a foul heart,  
A fair field and no favour."

The power of woman's beauty over man, however, has always been
proverbial all over the world, and, from the earliest period, it has
formed one of the leading subjects of the wise-saws current in most
countries. Thus a popular German maxim tells us that "one hair of a
woman draws more than a bell-rope," or, as another version has it,
"Beauty draws us with a single hair;" and there is a common saying in
the East, "A good-looking woman in a house is the foe of all the plain
ones." At the same time there have never been wanting moralists to warn
us that, however powerful the fascinatory influence of woman's beauty
may be, it is far from being always supreme. Accordingly there are a
number of proverbs which affirm that, whereas "beauty is potent, money
is omnipotent," with which may be compared the oft-quoted saying to the
effect that, "Beauties without fortunes have sweethearts plenty; but
husbands none at all;" or, as it is sometimes said, "Beauty without
bounty avails nought." Oftentimes those proverbs, which admit the
fascinatory charms of a woman's beauty, qualify their statements with a
warning, as in the German proverb, "Beauty is the eye's food, and the
soul's sorrow;" an old English maxim is to the same effect: "A beautiful
woman is the paradox of the eves, the hell of the soul, and the
purgatory of the purse;" and again, "Wickedness with beauty is the
devil's hook baited;" the same idea being found in Hindustani proverbial
wisdom, in which we find this maxim: "All pretty maids are poisonous
pests; an enemy kills by hiding these by smiles and jests." It is said
in Italy that "a beautiful woman smiling bespeaks a purse-weeping," with
which may be compared the German adage:--

"Hares are caught with hounds,  
Fools with praises,  
Women with gold."

Indeed, in most countries there are numerous proverbs to the same
effect, demonstrating how one of the penalties--one which oftentimes is
man's ruin--paid for woman's beauty is an empty purse. Similarly, we are
told that "a handsome hostess is bad for the purse;" and hence there is
some truth in the following: "A rich man is never ugly in the eyes of a
girl."

Proverb-making cynics, again, have not always been very chivalrous and
complimentary in their allusions to the charms of the fair sex. Thus, as
beautiful women had the reputation of being less handy and serviceable
than plain ones, the adage arose which says--"A fair woman and a slashed
gown will always find some nail in the way;" in other words, as women
value themselves on their personal attractions, they are in the same
degree generally apt to be negligent in other things. According to
another version of the same proverb, it is very commonly said that "the
more women look in their glasses the less they look to their houses."
Cynical savings, happily, of this kind, as far as beauty is concerned,
are in the minority;

for, in most legendary and historical lore, good features have been made
characteristic of nearly all superior and exalted beings. Hence, at the
present day, beauty is often said to be "fairylike," it having been a
popular belief that beauty, united with power, was one of the most
attractive forms of the fairy tribe. Such was that of Spenser's Fairy
Queen, and of Shakespeare's Titania; and it may be remembered how, in
"Antony and Cleopatra" (act iv. sc. 8), Antony, on seeing Cleopatra
enter, says to Scarus:--

"To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,  
Make her thanks bless thee."

And in "Cymbeline" (act iii. sc. 6), when the two brothers find Imogen
in their cave, Belarius exclaims:--

"But that it eats our victuals, I should think  
Here were a fairy,"

and he then adds :--

"By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,  
An earthly paragon! Behold divineness,  
No elder than a boy."

Beauty, too, which Plato described as "a privilege of Nature;" Homer, "a
glorious gift of Nature;" Ovid, "a favour bestowed by the Gods;" and
Shakespeare, "that miracle and queen of gems," has formed the theme of
most of those traditionary tales of love and romance which, embodied in
the folk-tales of different countries, portray the many beliefs and
fancies which, in the course of centuries, have grouped round this
acknowledged charm of womanhood.

The absence of beauty, on the other hand, was, in days of old,
considered almost a disgrace, it having been a common idea that the
ugliness of the wicked was in proportion to their evil nature. Hence, an
unprepossessing appearance subjected the unfortunate woman to the most
uncomplimentary stigma, and oftentimes even made her an object of
contempt; for, according to an old proverb, "An ugly woman is a disease
of the stomach, a handsome woman a disease of the head." And there is
the Hebrew adage, "Ugliness is the guardian of women," for the chance is
remote of those who are not gifted with beauty yielding to the snares of
temptation. But even ugliness occasionally outweighs the advantages of
beauty, for the German mother reminds her daughter that "a virtuous
woman, though ugly, is the ornament of her house;" and there is the
Spanish adage, which says, "the ugliest is the best housewife;" and our
own proverb runs: "She's better than she's bonnie;" although a Tamil
proverb, referring ironically to an ugly woman, speaks of her as "killed
with beauty;" and a Welsh adage tells us that if an ugly woman fall,
breaking her hip, the pity she gets is, "how clumsy to trip." It has,
however, been generally acknowledged that there is no woman who is not,
more or less, fond of flattery, and there is a common saying in Spain,
"Tell a woman she is pretty and you will turn her head," a piece of
proverbial lore which is found in France and Germany, and also in our
own country. But, after all, there is one point to be remembered, for a
popular German adage says that "handsome women generally fall to the lot
of ugly men." There is truth, also, in the Sindhi adage which says,
"Better a blind eye than a blind fate," which means, better be ugly than
unfortunate, as many favoured with beauty are supposed to be; for, after
all, as the proverb truly remarks, "a good fame is better than a good
face." It is recorded that Madame de Bourignon was so ugly when born
that the proposal was actually made of smothering her, so as to spare
her a life of ridicule and humiliation; and, to quote a further
illustration, a story is told of the Emperor Henry IV., of Germany, who,
on entering a church, where an ugly priest happened to be officiating,
wondered in his mind whether it was possible for God to accept services
rendered by so ill-favoured a ministrant. But the imperial ministrations
were interrupted by the priest's boy mumbling, almost unititelligibly
the versicle: "It is He that hath made us, not we ourselves," whereupon
the priest removed him for his indistinct enunciation, and he repeated
the Psalmist's words, which the Emperor took as an undesigned rebuke to
his own thoughts.

Queen Elizabeth, similarly, was careful to admit into her household none
but those of "stature and birth;" and one day, it is recorded, she went
so far as to refuse the services of a certain individual for no other
reason than that one of his jaws was deficient of a tooth. But there was
Tamerlane's wife, who, although she had no nose, was considered a belle
by her contemporaries; and even hunchbacks have had their admirers on
the ground that the "dorsal curvature is the true line of beauty."

It has, after all, however, been generally admitted that beauty is, more
or less, deceptive, and especially where love is concerned, for, as the
popular adage says: "If Jack is in love, he is no judge of Jill's
beauty," which corresponds with the Italian saying, "Handsome is not
what is handsome, but what pleases." Similarly, the French have a
familiar proverb, "Never seemed a prison fair, nor a mistress foul,"
which has its counterpart in Germany, where it is said, "he whose fair
one squints says she ogles;" and "Everybody thinks his own cuckoo sings
better than another's nightingale;" with which we may compare what the
African negro says, "The beetle is a beauty in the eyes of its
mother"--love transforming all imperfections into beauty. But, as an
Eastern piece of proverbial wisdom reminds us--

"For virtue a woman our our wife we make;  
For her beauty we a concubine take,"

with which may be compared another Eastern adage:--

"Long not for the Goddess's beauty divine,  
Long that the star of your husband may shine."

The fact that love has a large mantle to hide faults is further shown in
an Arab proverb: "Love is the companion of blindness;" and the Talmud
emphasises the same truth: "To love a thing makes the eye blind, the ear
deaf;" and a Hindustani proverb runs thus: "Fall in love with an ogress,
and even she is a fairy," with which may be compared another not very
complimentary one, "Her name is Beauty, and a dog's her face." It is
interesting to find the same idea in Assamese folk-lore, wherein occurs
the following: "What shall I say of my step-mother's character--in one
hand she has chutney and in the other salt; she has no hair in the
middle of her head, but her husband calls her the beautiful one?" And
much the same idea is conveyed in the Hindustani piece of proverbial
wisdom: "She cries over her own idiot, but laugh's at another's;" and
the Dutch have a saying, "No ape but swears he has the handsomest
children."

Indeed, that in a lover's eyes, plainness oftentimes becomes actual
beauty, is exemplified over and over again in the literature of past and
modern days, for, in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (act v. sc. i)--

"The lover, all as frantic,  
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt."

Lord Lytton, in "Kenelm Chillingly," has introduced the charming song,
"The Beauty of the Mistress is in the Lover's Eye," which runs thus:--

"Is she not pretty, my Mabel May?  
Nobody ever yet called her so.  
Are not her lineaments faultless, say?  
If I must answer you plainly--No.

Joy to believe that the maid I love  
None but myself as she is can see;  
Joy that she steals from her heaven above,  
And is only revealed on this earth to me."

The same idea is introduced in Mrs. Browning's "My Kate;" and Balzac,
too, was of the same opinion, for he says, "When women love, they
forgive us everything, even our crimes; when they do not love us, they
give us credit for nothing, not even for our virtues." But, on the other
hand, there is equal truth in the Welsh proverb, which is only too
frequently proved in the romance of daily life, "Faults are thick when
love is thin."

Some, again, have tried to disparage beauty by maintaining that it is
only "skin-deep," a notion which has found its way into proverbial lore.
The literature of the past contains sundry allusions to this idea, and
in the Rev. Rob. Fleming's poems (1691) we are reminded that--

"Beauty is but skin-thick, and so doth fall  
Short of those statues made of wood or stone."

And in Ralph Venning's "Orthodoxe Paradoxe" (1650) it is said that--

"All the beauty of the world 'tis but skin-deep, a sunne-blast
defaceth;"

which is not unlike Sir Thomas Overbury's lines in his poem, "A Wife"--

"And all the carnall beauty of my wife  
Is but skin-deep."

And yet there is much truth in the Hindu adage, "The eyes love beauty,
the heart loves wisdom," for, as it has been observed elsewhere, there
is no denying the truth of the old French proverb, "It is not the
greatest beauties that inspire the most profound passion;" and to the
same purport is the German adage, "One cannot live on beauty."
