# Sacred Texts: Women and Religion
<title>Intangible Textual Heritage: Women and Religion</title>

All of the major world religions deprecate women to some degree. This
page archives texts which relate specifically to women and religion from
a female perspective. This includes [historic feminist texts](#feminist.md)
on the topic, texts about [Goddess-oriented sprituality](#goddess.md) and
[Amazons](#womenwarriors.md), as well as [texts from otherwise
male-dominated religions](#other.md) in the same vein. As might be
expected, there are far fewer of these than might be desired.
