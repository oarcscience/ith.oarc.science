# CHAPTER III

### EPHESIAN ARTEMIS

The magnificent temple of which Christian writers speak as that of "the
great goddess whom all Asia and the world worshippeth" replaced the
earlier and more famous shrine which burned to the ground on the night
of Alexander's birth. Two hundred and twenty years had been spent in the
process of building the first temple, and when this was destroyed the
Ephesians at once began the construction of another even more
costly. <span id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) The older Artemisium is
said to have possessed among its treasures four statues of Amazons
executed by four of the most distinguished sculptors of the fifth
century, Phidias, Polyclitus, Cresilas, and Phradmon. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) The tradition is only one of many
which indicate very close connection between the Amazons and this
sanctuary.

The Ephesians themselves looked upon their Artemisium as one of the most
sacred spots in the whole world. Tacitus <span
id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) remarks: "Primi omnium Ephesii adiere,
memorantes non, ut vulgus crederat, Dianam atque Apollinem Delo genitos:
esse apud se Cenechrium amnem, lucum Ortygiam, ubi Latonam partu
gravidam et oleae, quae tum etiam maneat, adnisam, edidisse ea numina."
This seems to mean that the olive of Ephesian Artemis was set up against
the palm of Delian Apollo. Something of this kind happened historically,
as Thucydides <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) shows: "There was
of old a great gathering of the Ionians at

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Delos. . . . They went thither to the theoric
assembly with their wives and children, just as the Ionians now gather
at the *Ephesia*."

Greek Ephesus owed its origin to the Ionic Immigration and was reckoned
among the twelve cities of Ionia, yet in the band of colonists who
started out from the Prytaneum at Athens the Ionians were few, although
the expedition is designated by their name. Joined with them were the
Abantes of Euboea, the Orchomenian Minyae and the Cadmeans of Boeotia,
the Dryopes, Phocians, Molossians, the Arcadian Pelasgians, the Dorian
Epidaurians, and other tribes whom Herodotus does not mention by
name. <span id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) It may be that the Ionian
strain was less strong at Ephesus than in some of the other cities of
the group, since this place and Colophon were the only ones of the
twelve that did not take part at the *Apaturia*, the great clan festival
of the Ionians. <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) Yet the Codrids,
who figured prominently as conductors of the undertaking, were
Ionians, <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) and Androclus, son of
Codrus himself, was by some <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md)
believed to have been the founder of Ephesus. Pausanias was told that he
fell in battle against the Carians and was shown his tomb at
Ephesus. <span id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md)

Pausanias <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) represents Androclus,
whom he calls "king of the Ionians who sailed to Ephesus," the founder
of the Ionic city, but he believes the shrine of Artemis there to be
very ancient. He states with certainty that it antedated the Ionic
Immigration by many years, being older even than the oracular shrine of
Apollo at Didymi. He attributes its establishment to autochthons,
Coresus, <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) who was son of

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Caÿster, and Ephesus. He says that the pre-Ionic
inhabitants of the city were Leleges and Lydians--with a predominance of
the latter--and that, although Androclus drove out of the land all those
whom he found in the upper city, he did not interfere with those who
dwelt about the sanctuary. By giving and receiving pledges he put these
on a footing of neutrality. These remarks of Pausanias find confirmation
in the form of the cult in historic times, which, being in all its
essentials non-Hellenic, admits of plausible interpretation only as an
indigenous worship taken over by the Greek settlers.

The Artemisium at Ephesus was pre-eminently a shrine which gave rights
of sanctuary to suppliants, a fact indicative of a wide difference
between this goddess and the Greek Artemis. <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) Those who invoked the protection of
the sanctuary appeared with olive-boughs twined with fillets of
wool. <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md)

The Amazons are noticed in legend as founders of the shrine and as
fugitives claiming its asylum. Pindar <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) told that they established the
sanctuary on their way to Athens to war against Theseus. Possibly this
is the account followed by Callimachus <span
id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) in the lines telling how the Amazons
set up the βρέτας of Artemis "in the shade of an oak with goodly
trunk <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) which grew in Ephesus by
the sea." Justin <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) states the
tradition that the city itself was founded by the Amazons.
Pausanias <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) maintains that Pindar
was incorrect in his assertion that the shrine was founded by the
Amazons. He

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

says that long before they started on their Attic campaign they had
twice taken refuge at the Artemisium, once from Heracles, and, earlier
still, from Dionysus. Tacitus, <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md)
continuing his quotation of claims put forward by the Ephesians
themselves, says: "Mox Liberum patrem, bello victorem, supplicibus
Amazonum, quae aram insederant, ignovisse. Auctam hinc concessu
Herculis, cum Lydia poteretur, caerimoniam templo." According to this
the Amazons inaugurated the custom of seeking asylum at the Artemisium,
and to them therefore was due the conspicuous part which the shrine
played as a place of sanctuary. It is reasonable to infer from these
various sources that in the holy records and traditions of the Ephesian
temple the Amazons were prominent. Even Pausanias, who denies that the
Amazons founded the shrine, ascribes to their fame, since they were
reported its founders, a large measure of the prestige which belonged to
the cult of Ephesian Artemis all over the Greek world. He mentions this
first in his list of reasons for the great reputation of the shrine,
placing it on a par with the extreme antiquity of the sanctuary.
Secondary to these two he mentions the wealth and influence of the city
and the epiphany of the goddess there. <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) We must, indeed, believe that the
Amazons stood in intimate relation to the cult of Ephesian Artemis. Yet
in historical times there was a regulation which forbade women to enter
the sanctuary. <span id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md)

Apart from her name it would be difficult to recognise the Greek Artemis
in the deity of Ephesus. The cult statue showed her in form at once
primitive and Oriental. <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) It was
carved out of a block of wood, <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md)
shaped like a herm in the

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

lower part, showing the feet. The torso was that of a woman of many
breasts. The type depicted on coins <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) is that of a draped woman of many
breasts, wearing a turret-crown on her head and resting either arm on a
twisted column. She was served by eunuch priests, called Megabyzi, and
by maidens. Presumably these priests are the same as the Essenes, whom
Pausanias mentions as servitors for one year, who were bound by strict
rules of chastity and required to submit to ascetic regulations of
dietary and ablution. <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) The
virgins associated with them passed through three stages: Postulant,
Priestess, Past-Priestess. <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) There
is nothing to indicate the length of their term of service. The Megabyzi
were held in the highest possible honour, <span
id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) as were the Galli at Pessinus.

This goddess of the turret-crown and of many breasts, whose shrine
required the attendance of the Megabyzi, is certainly a form of Cybele.
If we were guided solely by the remark of Pausanias <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) that the sanctuary was founded by the
pre-Ionic people of the region, that is, by Leleges and Lydians, among
whom the latter were more numerous, we should expect to find the Lydian
Mother worshipped here. The name Artemis, under which the goddess
appears, indicates that the Greek colonists appropriated the cult which
they found. The Lydian Mother was evidently identical with *Magna Mater*
of Phrygia. Yet the Ephesian goddess, who is the Mother

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

under the name Artemis, is in her cult image neither Cybele as we know
her--whether under baetylic form or in the likeness of a matron <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md)--nor Hellenic Artemis.
Artemidorus, <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) the student of
dreams, says that peculiar sanctity attached to a particular type which
he defines as that of Artemis Ephesia, Artemis of Perge, and the goddess
called Eleuthera among the Lycians. It is tempting to ascribe to the
mysterious Leleges the differences which separate the type of Ephesia
and the other two from Cybele.

All that Pausanias <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) tells about
these Leleges at Ephesus is that they were a branch of the Carians.
Herodotus <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) says that the Leleges
were a people who in old times dwelt in the islands of the Aegean and
were subject to Minos of Crete; that they were driven from their homes
by the Dorians and Ionians, after which they took refuge in Caria and
were named Carians. It seems reasonable to give weight to the remarks of
Herodotus on this subject, since he was a Carian-born Ionian. We should
infer then that the Leleges of Ephesus, whom Pausanias calls a branch of
the Carians, were closely connected with the island-people who were once
subject to Minos. Both Herodotus <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md)
and Pausanias <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) say that the
Lycians were of Cretan origin. It is therefore not strange that at
Ephesus and in Lycia the same type of goddess was worshipped.
Tradition <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) also connected
Pamphylia with Crete, which

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

may account for the presence of the type in Perge. <span
id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) An inscription <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) which dates probably from about the
third century B.C. gives direct evidence of association between Crete
and Ephesian Artemis. It is the dedication of a votive offering: "To the
Healer of diseases, to Apollo, Giver of Light to mortals, Eutyches has
set up in votive offering (a statue of) the Cretan Lady of Ephesus, the
Light-Bearer (ἄνασσαν Ἐφέσου Κρησίαν φαεσφόρον." The inscription
suggests the words from the Oedipus Rex:  <span
id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) "Lyceian Lord, scatter, 1 pray thee,
for our aid thine unconquerable darts from thy gold-twisted bowstring
and with them the fire-bearing rays of Artemis with which she rusheth
over the Lycian mountains." The Cretan Light-Bearer may easily be the
fire-bearing Artemis of Lycia. The epithet Λύκειος used of Apollo gives
the form Λυκεία for Artemis. An Artemis by this name was worshipped at
Troezen. <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) The local exegetes were
unable to explain the application of the epithet. Therefore Pausanias
conjectures that it means, either that Hippolytus had thus commemorated
the extermination of wolves at Troezen, or that Λυκεία was a cult
epithet among the Amazons, to whom Hippolytus was akin through his
mother. It seems highly probable that Artemis Λυκεία was the goddess of
Ephesus, Perge, and Lycia, who was known as the Cretan Lady of Ephesus.

Eleuthera, the special name by which this Artemis was worshipped among
the Lycians suggests Ariadne, whom Ovid <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) calls *Libera*. <span
id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) The name belongs to her as the wife of
Dionysus in Crete. Dionysus appears in the legends of the Artemisium as
one of the foes of the Amazons who drove them

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

to this asylum. <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) Perhaps the idea
of hostility on his part is to be explained by the rites in his honour
at the annual festival of the *Scierea* at Alea. These required that
women should be scourged at his altar. <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) In this there is reminiscence of the
Egyptian mournings for Osiris, which were marked with practices of
self-affliction, and Osiris suggests Atys, the companion of the Asiatic
Mother. <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) There is no reason to
doubt that Dionysus was closely connected with Cybele. The musical
system by which his worship was characterised was Phrygian, <span
id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) and Euripides in the *Bacchae*
completely identifies his rites with those of the Mother. We hear also
of men who marched in procession at his festivals with cymbals and
tambourines. <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) Considering the
fact that at Ephesus and at Pessinus there were eunuch priests, also
that Euripides <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) depicts Dionysus
as a womanish person who forces Pentheus to assume woman's garments,
that elsewhere <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) the god is called
man and woman, and, in addition to this, that there was a legend <span
id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) that he received woman's attire from
Rhea at Cybela, there is a strong presumption in favour of the
hypothesis that Dionysus touches the cult of the Great Mother and that
of

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ephesian Artemis in some way associated with the
strange Oriental idea of confusion of sex. <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) If this interpretation is correct, it
probably applies also to the rites of Ariadne, for at Athens in the
feast of the *Oschophoria* two youths dressed as women conducted a
chorus in honour of Dionysus and Ariadne. <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md)

The Ephesian legend of Heracles and the Amazons <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) probably indicates a connection
between the cult of Ephesian Artemis and that of the Lydian Heracles.
This cult of Heracles is reflected in Greek legend as the adventure of
the hero at the court of Omphale. The story runs thus: <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) Heracles was compelled to submit to
slavery to this Lydian queen in order that he might recover from the
madness which punished him for his murder of Eurytus. Omphale, who was
daughter of Dardanus and widow of Tmolus, became enamoured of her
captive and married him. He gave up to her his weapons and received in
return woman's dress and the distaff. He is represented sitting among
the maidens and allowing the queen to beat him with her sandals whenever
he has erred in spinning. The names Dardanus and Tmolus suggest, the
former, Mount Ida and Samothrace, the latter, Lydia. It is noteworthy
that Pausanias <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) identifies this
Oriental Heracles with the Idaean Dactyl of that name. Omphale is
presumably *Magna Mater*, and probably the detail of the gift of the
weapons <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) to her points to the
fact that this goddess was warlike and political in Asia Minor. In this
legend, as also in that which connects the Amazons with Dionysus, there

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

appears the peculiar Asiatic idea of sex-confusion. <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) Granted a close connection between the
Oriental Heracles and the Amazons at Ephesus, <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) the supposition does not seem
audacious that the most widely spread of all the Hellenic traditions
concerning the Amazons, that of the attack by Heracles on Themiscyra,
owed its origin to a cult saga typified by that of Ephesus.

To summarise: There was close connection between the Amazons and
Ephesian Artemis, a type of the Mother showing Cretan-Lycian
affiliations. Their place in the cult gave rise to the two local sagas
which emphasise the Oriental idea of sex-confusion.

*Quaest*. Gr. 56. The story of Dionysus and the Amazons appears also in
art. *Cf.* *Arch. Ztg.* 1845, pl. 30, showing sarcophagus from Cortona.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[37:178](rca04.htm#fr_177.md) Paus. 8. 23, 1. The
chief temples of the place as described by Pausanias were of Artemis
Ephesia, of Athena Alea, or Hippia (*cf.* Paus. 8. 47, 1), of Dionysus.
Possibly the flagellation of women in the Dionysiac mysteries is
represented on some frescoes recently discovered in a Roman mansion near
Pompeii (Nation, Dec. 1, 1910, p. 534). *V*. *Am. Jour. Arch.* 15
(1911), p. 567.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[37:179](rca04.htm#fr_178.md) Parnell believes
that Ariadne was originally a Cretan goddess, who may easily have been
identified with Cybele, Bendis, etc. (*op. cit.* 2. p. 473). Possibly
the legend of Dionysus and Ariadne grew out of the Cretan cult in which
he was her *paredros*.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[37:180](rca04.htm#fr_179.md) Aristot. *Polit*. 8.
7, 9; Eur. *Bacch*. 58.

ff.

28; Aeschyl. Fr. *Edoni ap.* Aristoph. *Thesm*. 135.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[37:184](rca04.htm#fr_183.md) Apollod. 3. 5, 1.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[38:185](rca04.htm#fr_184.md) *Cf.* Atys as *notha
mulier*, Catull. *Atys*, 27; Adonis, male and female, *Orph. Hymn*, 56.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[38:186](rca04.htm#fr_185.md) Plut. Thes. 23. On
the rites of Ariadne-Aphrodite at Amathus *v*. Farnell, *op. cit.* 2. p.
634. Possibly some connection with Dionysus is implied in the strange
epithet of Ephesian Artemis, Ἐλουσία, Hesych. *s.v*.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[38:187](rca04.htm#fr_186.md) Paus. *l. c.* (7. 2,
7-8); Tac. *l. c.* (3. 61).

<span id="fn_189"></span>[38:190](rca04.htm#fr_189.md) The battle-axe
receives special mention. *Cf.* double-axe of the Amazons.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[39:191](rca04.htm#fr_190.md) In a work now out of
date (the *Lydiaca* of Th. Mencke, Berlin, 1843) there is valuable
information on this subject. *V*. especially ch. 8. p. 22.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[39:192](rca04.htm#fr_191.md) The words of Tacitus
(*l. c.*) representing the tradition at Ephesus itself, are very
important: "*Auctam hinc concessu Herculis, cum Lydia poteretur,
caerimoniam templo*." Heraclides Ponticus (Fr. 34), supposing 'Ἕφεσος
and ἐφεῖναι to be etymologically akin, derives the name of the city from
the attack which Heracles made on the Amazons from Mycale to Pitane.
