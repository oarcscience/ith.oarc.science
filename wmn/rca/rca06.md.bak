# CHAPTER V

### ARES

The legend of the Amazons was not superficially rooted at Athens. This
is proved by the fact that it found expression in cult practice at one
of the greater festivals of the state. Before the *Thesea* the Athenians
annually offered sacrifice to the Amazons, thus commemorating the
victory of Theseus over the women. The decisive battle was said to have
been fought on the day marked by the oblation of the *Boedromia*. <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) Plutarch <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) bases his belief in the reality of the
invasion of Attica on three points: the place names, Amazonium and
Horcomosium; the presence of graves of the fallen; the yearly sacrifice
to the Amazons.

The general view of ancient writers <span
id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) is that the Amazons made the Areopagus
the basis of their operations, having established their camp there in a
spot thenceforth called the Amazonium <span
id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) Aeschylus <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) derives the name of the hill itself
from the fact that there the Amazons offered frequent sacrifice <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) to Ares while they held it as a
citadel against the Acropolis. The statement is remarkable in view of
two facts which seem to show Ares as the patron of Theseus rather

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

than of the Amazons: Plutarch, <span id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md)
quoting Clidemus, says that before entering the critical battle with the
Amazons Theseus sacrificed to Phobus, son of Ares, and hereby won the
day; the tradition <span id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) at Troezen
told that Theseus commemorated his victory over the Amazons there by
dedicating a temple to Ares at the entrance to the Genethlium.

It is therefore impossible to determine the exact relation in which Ares
stood to the Amazons in the story of the invasion of Greece. All that
may be said is that his name belongs to the saga of Theseus and the
Amazons in the two accounts, the Attic and the Troezenian. It must be
added that the saga bears the marks of great age. Herein Theseus is not
an intruder, as he evidently is in the tales of the storm of Themiscyra,
nor is he a substitute for Heracles. The story is primarily concerned
with Theseus himself, the great hero of the two states. While in the
former it is connected with ritual acts, in the latter it is hallowed by
association with the Genethlium, the traditional birth-place of
Theseus. <span id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) Moreover, on the
tradition of the Amazons at Troezen rests the story of Hippolytus, whose
sepulchre assured the safety of the nation. <span
id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md)

The Attic traditions about Theseus were concerned chiefly with his
adventures in Crete. With retrospect toward these the Athenians
celebrated the festivals of the *Oschophoria*, the *Pyanepsia*, and the
*Thesea*. Ariadne, as it has been stated, <span
id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md) was probably a Cretan goddess, with
whose worship at Athens are to be connected the rites of the
Oschophoria, wherein two youths disguised as maidens led the girls'
chorus. The implication

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

is that the Oriental idea of sex confusion was associated with the
festival. It seems therefore that the ceremonies instituted by Theseus
reflect the Anatolian worship of Cybele. It accords with the customary
restraint of Hellenic habits that the Oriental idea shown in the cults
of Cybele, Ephesian Artemis, and the Syrian Goddess, manifested itself
at Athens merely in a pleasing masque. The name of Theseus also
connected Troezen with Crete. Phaedra, the wife with whom he lived at
Troezen, is famous as the destroyer of the Amazon's son, Hippolytus, and
as another princess of the house of Minos. Thus in its twofold aspect
the tradition of Theseus suggests the time when "Minoan" Crete was
pre-eminent. It maybe that the association of the Amazon legend with the
tale of Theseus is to be ascribed to some such source. In that case
Ares, a deity whose cult had slight prominence in Greece, might by
reason of his place in the saga of Theseus and the Amazons, be connected
with the cult of Aphrodite-Ariadne. There is this suggestion in a note
from Olen which Pausanias <span id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md)
inserts in the account of his visit to the shrine of Hebe at Phlius.
Olen connects Ares with Hebe as her own brother, born of Hera. Her
shrine at Phlius is shown to be very old by the fact that her worship
here was in the strictest sense aniconic. Her annual festival of the
"Ivy-Cuttings" has al hint of Dionysus and even of the ivy-shaped
shields of the Amazons. From other sources it may be gathered that she
was akin to Aphrodite-Ariadne. <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md)
Pausanias says that Hebe was substituted for her more ancient name,
Ganymeda. In this there is reminiscence of the Trojan youth caught tip
to heaven by Zeus. The feminine form implies the appropriation by one
sex of the characteristics of the other. This might belong naturally to
a Phrygian legend.

A search for parallels to the association which Aeschylus

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

mentions between Ares and the Amazons discovers first of all, as most
striking, the legend told of the statue of Ares Γυναικο-θοίνας in the
market-place at Tegea. <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) The
statue was explained as the dedication of a band of Tegeate women who
had won a victory over the Spartans in the time of King Charillus of
Sparta. After peace was established the women instituted a festival in
honour of Ares. Since men were excluded from the sacrifice and sacred
banquet, the god was called "Entertainer of Women." It is interesting to
find such a tale in Arcadian Tegea, the home of Atalanta, herself
similar to the Amazons. It is worth bearing in mind that Atalanta won
the spoils of the Calydonian hunt in the country of the Aetolians and
Curetes, the kindred of the folk of pre-historic Pyrrhichus. In the
temple of Athena Alea at Tegea, which contained these spoils, <span
id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) Marpessa, leader of the women who
honoured Ares, dedicated her shield. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md)

In the immediate neighbourhood of Tegea there was a shrine of Ares
Ἀφνειός, <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) situated on a mountain
of which the name Cresium implies the worship of Cretan Dionysus. <span
id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) The epithet was explained by the story
that Ares enabled his child Aëropus to draw milk from the breasts of his
mother after her death. The mother Aërope, grand-daughter of Aleus, was
akin to Atalanta. The lifetime of her child by Ares was placed in the
generation preceding the Dorian Invasion. <span
id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md)

Elsewhere in Arcadia,--at Megalopolis <span
id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) and near Acacesium <span
id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md)--there were monuments attesting the
foundation of the cult of Ares in this canton in early days. With this

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

should be compared the statement of Arnobius, <span
id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) that there was a legend of thirteen
months' servitude exacted of Ares in Arcadia. The general tendency of
all the evidence is in support of the theory that the cult of Ares
Γυναικοθοίνας originated in primitive times.

There were two other legends of armed women in Greece, both localised,
like the Tegeate story, in the Peloponnese. A statue of Ares at Argos
was explained as the dedication of a band of women under the poetess
Telesilla who had won a victory over the Spartans. <span
id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md) The other legend belonged to Sparta.
Here a troop of women commemorated their victory over the Messenians by
founding a temple to Aphrodite. <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md)
The most obvious interpretation of the epithet is to derive it from Ares
and to render it "Warlike." It is used of Athena in three oaths of
alliance suggestive of the martial character of the goddess. <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) The Athenians built a temple to Athena
Ἀρεία at Plataea, constructed from the spoils of Marathon. <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) After his acquittal on the Areopagus
Orestes is said to have dedicated an altar to Athena Ἀρεία. <span
id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) In this the reference is evidently to
the name of the hill on which the court sat which the Greeks themselves,
however mistaken they may have been in their etymology, certainly
connected with Ares. <span id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) These
instances of the use of the epithet favour the idea that it was derived
from the name of Ares. It may be argued that Aphrodite Ἀρεία was a type
of the goddess conceived as guardian of the state. In this aspect she
was more frequently worshipped at Sparta than elsewhere in Greece. The
probabilities are that she was

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

represented armed. <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) This
political goddess of Sparta was the Oriental Aphrodite, called Urania.
The fact that one group of armed women gave special honour to Ares,
another to Aphrodite Ἀρεία, is of importance to the investigation. The
hint that the two deities were in some way associated suggests
connection between Ares and the Anatolian cult of the warlike Mother
whom the Amazons worshipped.

It would seem that the connection between Ares and the Warlike Aphrodite
was not slight. At Thebes the joint cult of the two as a conjugal pair
was established at an early date, <span
id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292.md) and their union was said to have given
rise to the Cadmean family and thence to Dionysus. Through marriage with
Harmonia, daughter of Ares and Aphrodite, Cadmus obtained the throne,
and from the teeth of the serpent sacred to Ares he raised up the famous
crop of warriors. <span id="fr_293"></span>[294](#fn_293.md) Tümpell <span
id="fr_294"></span>[295](#fn_294.md) believes that the joint cult of Ares
and Aphrodite originated at Thebes, and that from this city it spread
through Greece, acquiring prominence in Attica and Arcadia. He finds the
goddess to be the Oriental Urania, yet, strangely enough, he is
unwilling to believe that she was conceived as an armed goddess in the
earliest times at Thebes.

In Laconia, where Warlike Aphrodite, or Urania, was specially
reverenced, the cult of Ares was more dignified and apparently more
ancient than in other parts of Greece. Epicharmus is said to have
claimed the deity as a Spartan. <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md)
Under the name Enyalius he was worshipped by the Spartan ephebes. <span
id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) Each of the two bands into which the
youths were

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

divided sacrificed a puppy to him, performing the ceremony at night in
the Phoebaeum near Therapne. The ritual bears throughout the marks of
primitive times. The most striking detail is the sacrifice of dogs, in
mentioning which Pausanias remarks that he knows of only one other
instance, namely, to Enodia, or Hecate, at Colophon. There are, however,
other records of the practice, <span id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md)
in which it is noteworthy that the custom belongs to the worship of
Hecate. Ares was worshipped under his own name at Therapne in a temple
which Pausanias <span id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) describes as one
of the earliest monuments in the region. The cult legend was that the
image was brought from Colchis by the Dioscuri. The god had a strange
epithet, Theritas, supposedly derived from Thero, the name of his nurse.
Pausanias is so dissatisfied with this etymology that he suggests that
the word was learned from the Colchians and was unintelligible to the
Greeks. Wide <span id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) states a plausible
hypothesis, that the cult was of Boeotian origin, basing his theory on
the affiliations of the word Theritas. It may, however, have been a very
early indigenous cult, for Therapne was evidently an important
pre-Dorian site, as excavations have proved. <span
id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300.md) Here the Dioscuri received special
honours, and Helen was worshipped from old times as a nature
goddess. <span id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) Pausanias <span
id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md) was told that the town was named from
a daughter of Lelex. It is possible to infer that the cult of Ares
Theritas, in which the temple was one of the oldest monuments in a
region where pre-Dorian influence was strong, was "Lelegian." The people
who established it would thus be akin to the Curetes of Aetolia and
Acarnania. The connection with the Dioscuri favours the theory. <span
id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md)

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

There are two other examples of the Laconian worship of Ares. As
Enyalius <span id="fr_304"></span>[305](#fn_304.md) he had a statue at
Sparta near the *Dromos*, which represented him in fetters. In *Ancient
Village*, a hamlet near Geronthrae, he had a sacred grove and temple.
Here there was an annual festival from which women were excluded. <span
id="fr_305"></span>[306](#fn_305.md)

It is, on the whole, safe to conclude that in Laconia Ares was revered
in early times. The cult may have been indigenous among the pre-Dorians,
or it may have been an importation from Boeotia, where he was worshipped
with Aphrodite. Possibly the Fettered Ares of Sparta should be connected
with a Fettered Aphrodite <span id="fr_306"></span>[307](#fn_306.md) in the
same city. The two types may have given rise to a tale like that of
Arcadia, of the servitude of Ares, <span
id="fr_307"></span>[308](#fn_307.md) and the "lay of Demodocus" in the
Odyssey could be referred to some such myth. Traditions of armed women
in Tegea and in Sparta serve to connect Ares in Arcadia with Aphrodite
Ἀρεία in Sparta.

There are not many traces of the cult of Ares elsewhere in Greece. The
mythical genealogies of northern Greece associated him with Minyan
Orchomenus, <span id="fr_308"></span>[309](#fn_308.md) Minyan
Thessaly, <span id="fr_309"></span>[310](#fn_309.md) Curetis, <span
id="fr_310"></span>[311](#fn_310.md) and Aetolia. <span
id="fr_311"></span>[312](#fn_311.md) Mention has already been made of
Thebes. At Athens <span id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312.md) he was said to
have been the father of Alcippe by Aglaurus, a primitive goddess. In the
Peloponnese he was connected by genealogical legends with

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Tegea, <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313.md)
Elis, <span id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314.md) and Tritea in
Achaea. <span id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315.md) It is impossible to give
much weight to such myths unsupported by further evidence, inasmuch as
there was a tendency among Greek writers of all times to consider any
famous warrior of the heroic age a son of Ares. The statement applies
also to warlike races like the Phlegyae, mentioned by Homer and other
poets.

This investigation of the worship of Ares in Greece proper yields two
important results: first, it tends to indicate that the god was
worshipped in primitive times; secondly, in the relation between the
cult of Ares and that of the Oriental Aphrodite at an early date in
Thebes, and in the hints of a similar connection in Arcadia and Laconia,
there is the suggestion of contact with the Amazons, who worshipped a
goddess resembling this Aphrodite. This raises the question whether the
period may be determined in which the joint cult originated in Greek
lands.

Farnell <span id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316.md) conjectures that at
Thebes the Oriental goddess was brought from the east by the "Cadmeans,"
while Ares was an ancient god of the land. He believes that "by the
fiction of a marriage" her cult was reconciled to the older worship. The
hostility of Cadmus toward the sacred serpent of Ares and the wrath of
the god against the hero are legendary details which support some such
theory as this. Cadmus seems to have been a late comer, for he is not
mentioned in the Homeric poems, where Amphion and Zethus are named as
the founders of Thebes. <span id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317.md) It looks
as if in Elis also a form of the Oriental Aphrodite was reconciled with
an indigenous cult

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

\[paragraph continues\] of Ares. Here the genealogical myth is not the
only evidence for the worship of Ares; an altar to Ares in the
race-course at Olympia attests the cult. <span
id="fr_318"></span>[319](#fn_318.md) By the legend Pelops married
Hippodamia, granddaughter to Ares. Hesychius <span
id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) identifies her with Aphrodite, and
Pelops, like Cadmus, was conceived as coming from the east. <span
id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md) The parallel is practically exact. In
the case of Pelops the legends which connect him with Lydia and
Paphlagonia are more plausibly interpreted as reflexes of Hellenic
settlement in Asia Minor than as the record of the planting of an
Asiatic colony near Olympia. <span id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md)
Therefore the cult of Aphrodite-Hippodamia would seem to have come into
Elis by means of religious influence flowing back from the stream of
emigration to the cast. Thus the Elean parallel would be of service to
Farnell's argument. The Attic myth of Theseus tends, however, to support
the opposite theory. This saga certainly preserved flue memory of the
predominance of Crete in the Aegean. <span
id="fr_322"></span>[323](#fn_322.md) Thus Aphrodite-Ariadne probably
belonged to the pre-Hellenic inhabitants of Attica. It may be stated as
an hypothesis that Ares was also worshipped in very early times at
Athens. The evidence is this: his connection with Aglaurus, who seems to
have been a primitive goddess; <span id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323.md)
the invocation of Ares and Enyalius in the ephebes' oath, which
associates him with Aglaurus, the Attic Charites, and Hegemone; <span
id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) the well established cult of Ares in
the fifth century on the lower slopes of the Areopagus. <span
id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325.md) The association with Hegemone is of
special value, inasmuch as the epithet belongs to Aphrodite and to an
Artemis similar to Astrateia.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

The only direct information so far given concerning the worship of Ares
by the Amazons comes from Athens. <span
id="fr_326"></span>[327](#fn_326.md) Therefore it is reasonable to lay
stress on the legend of the Oriental Aphrodite in this state <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327.md) Yet we have no explicit statement that
she was related to Ares in his capacity of patron of the Amazons. The
nearest approach to a solution of the problem is possibly to be found in
the ancient association between Ares and Enyo <span
id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328.md) Enyo was apparently identified with
the armed goddess of Cappadocia who was known as Mâ, who, in turn, was
identified with Cybele as Mother of the Gods. <span
id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329.md) Aphrodite-Ariadne and the Armed
Aphrodite are in a measure forms of the Mother. Hence by an equation
Aphrodite under these two types becomes identical with Enyo, the
companion of Ares.

The evidence thus far gathered for a relation between Ares and the
Amazons may be stated. (1) Aeschylus mentions their habitual worship of
this god while they were besieging Athens; (2) Plutarch represents
Theseus at this time sacrificing to Phobus, son of Ares; (3) Pausanias
describes the temple of Ares at Troezen as a trophy of the victory of
Theseus over the Amazons; (4) in the association between Ares and
Aphrodite in several places, in similar association between Ares and
Enyo, and in the identification both of this Aphrodite and of Enyo with
the Mother whom the Amazons worshipped, there are obscure indications of
his belonging to the rites of the Mother; (5) there are fairly good
reasons for holding that Ares was an early, or pre-Hellenic god.
According to this evidence it is presumable that the connection between
Ares and the Amazons was indirect rather than direct. A striking

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

fact should be added. Wherever there were memorials of the Amazons in
Greece--at Athens, Troezen, Megara and Chaeronea in Boeotia, Chalcis in
Euboea, <span id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330.md) Thessaly <span
id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331.md)--there are some indications in each
canton that the cult of Ares was there in early times.

There are two other sets of records which belong to the discussion of
the cult of Ares in its relation to the Amazons. Of these the first is a
small group of ancient references to the Amazons as children of Ares.
Euripides <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332.md) terms them Ἀρείας
κόρας, a phrase echoed in the Latin *Mavortia* applied to one of
them. <span id="fr_333"></span>[334](#fn_333.md) The term is of no value
toward establishing a theory of a cult relation with Ares, for it as
colourless as are the familiar epic phrases, ὄζος Ἄρηος and θεράποντες
Άρηος, applied to warriors. Elsewhere, however, the Amazons are
conceived as actually daughters of the god. The stock genealogy assigned
to the race made them the children of Ares and Harmonia <span
id="fr_334"></span>[335](#fn_334.md) while Otrere is individually named as
the child of these parents. <span id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335.md)
Harmonia's name is easily associated with that of Ares, since in Theban
legends she appears as his daughter. It is therefore tempting to see in
the mother of the race the goddess Aphrodite. But it is impossible to
follow out the clue. The relationship is manifestly a stereotyped one,

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

manufactured by logographers. Furthermore, the mother is not
consistently called Harmonia. At times she appears as Armenia <span
id="fr_336"></span>[337](#fn_336.md) from which it may be inferred that the
name of the mother of the Amazons came from the study of geography, and
that Harmonia's crept in as a corruption. Arctinus <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) called Penthesilea a Thracian and the
daughter of Ares. Possibly the theory that the race in general were
children of Ares may have originated thus, or in some other poem of the
Cycle. If the Amazons had not been conspicuously warriors, and if it
were not at first sight a figure of speech to term a band of women the
children of the war-god, it would be easier to judge whether these
statements are poetical or representations of the view of genealogists.

The reference to Thrace is more valuable. Herodotus <span
id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) shows that the cult of Ares was
important here, for he says that the Thracians worshipped three gods,
Ares, Dionysus, and Artemis. As it has been said, the sacrifice of dogs
in the Spartan ritual of Enyalius finds its only parallels in the rites
of Thracian Hecate. <span id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md) Many modern
authorities <span id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340.md) believe that the
cult of Ares was of Thracian origin. <span
id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341.md) The rites of Dionysus, to whom he was
akin, <span id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342.md) belong also to the
orgiastic ceremonies of Phrygia. In general, as it has been noted, there
is striking similarity between the cults of Phrygia and those of Thrace.
This comes out strongly in the worship of the Mother. It is noteworthy
that the custom of sacrificing dogs, a conspicuous and difficult feature
in the rites of Ares and also

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

of Hecate, belonged to the Carian worship of Ares. <span
id="fr_343"></span>[344](#fn_343.md) It should be added that at Lagina in
Caria the orgiastic worship of Hecate was established with the peculiar
characteristic of the cult of Cybele at Pessinus and of Artemis at
Ephesus. <span id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344.md) Thus from all sides the
theory finds support that the cult of Ares should be classed as
Thracian-Phrygian and connected with that of the Mother. The inference
is that the pre-Hellenic Ares of the Greek mainland was a god of the
people who had a pre-historic culture allied to the "Minoan."

Apollonius Rhodius <span id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345.md) represents
the Amazons engaged in a ritual as strange as the sacrifice of dogs
which suggests Thrace and Caria. He relates that on "Ares island" in
Pontus they sacrificed horses in the temple of Ares. An obscure record
of this is apparently preserved by the Scholiast on a line in the
*Lysistrata* of Aristophanes. <span id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346.md)
The scholium mentions no deity by name; it merely comments on the legend
that Amazons sacrificed horses. Ares is not elsewhere than in the
passage from Apollonius named as a god thus worshipped, and possibly
here, even in the temple of Ares, the ritual is to be referred rather to
the worship of Cybele under baetylic form than to that of Ares. The
victim was a rare one among the Greeks, belonging to Apollo, Helios, the
wind-gods, and especially to Poseidon. It may be that the words of
Apollonius imply a connection between the cult of Ares and that of
Poseidon Hippius. At Troezen the temple of Ares gave access to the
Genethlium, probably a shrine of Poseidon; <span
id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347.md) at Athens there was the story of the
murder of Halirrhothius, son of Poseidon; <span
id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348.md) at Olympia the altar of Ares was
dedicated to

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

Ares Hippius. <span id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349.md) The cult of
Poseidon Hippius at Athens seems to have been in some way connected with
that of the pre-Ionic Semnae, or Eumenides, both at Colonus Hippius and
on the Areopagus. <span id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md) Possibly the
Troezenian legend of the death of Hippolytus suggests jealousy between
Ares, a divinity of the Amazons, and Poseidon, the reputed father of
Theseus. The ritual of horse sacrifice among the Amazons may be the
basis of the tradition that they were skilful horsewomen.

The sacrifice of horses to Ares is recorded as a custom of the
Scythians, <span id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351.md) a people who
apparently associated the horse with funerary oblations. <span
id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md)

The best example of this sacrifice in the rites of the war-god comes
from Rome, <span id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) where on October
fifteenth there was an annual race of bigae in the Campus Martius, after
which the near horse of the winning pair was sacrificed to Mars, and his
blood was allowed to drip on the hearth of the Regia. Probably the blood
of this sacrifice was afterwards mixed with the ingredients of the
sacred cakes. The rite evidently was in honour of Mars as a deity of
fertility. He was undoubtedly worshipped by the primitive Romans in this
capacity as well as in that of warrior. <span
id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md)

Apparently then the poetic legend of the Amazons' offering horses to
Ares presents him in a very primitive aspect with the suggestion that he
was a chthonic deity of fertility. As warrior and giver of increase he
resembles Apollo Carneüs. A scholium <span
id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md) furnishes information which
strengthens the supposition that he was in his primitive form a nature
god. This tells of an obsolete custom in time of war, by which the

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

signal for attack was given by priests of Ares called πυρφόροι, who
hurled lighted torches between the two armies. This suggests the
orgiastic cults of Thrace and Phrygia, in which the torch was a
prominent feature. It belonged also to the ceremonies of fire in honour
of Mars in primitive Rome. <span id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md)

Even in ancient times there were conflicting theories concerning the
provenience of the cult of Ares. Arnobius <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) says: "Quis Spartanum fuisse Martem
(prodidit)? Non Epicharmus auctor vester? Quis is Thraciae finibus
procreatum? Non Sophocles Atticus cunctis consentientibus theatris? Quis
mensibus in Arcadia tribus et decem vinctum? Quis ei canes ab Caribus,
quis ab Scythibus asinos immolari? Nonne principaliter cum ceteris
Apollodorus?" The general tendency of the evidence is in the direction
of the theory that Ares was an ancient god of the Thracians, of the
pre-Hellenic peoples of Greece, and of the races who worshipped the
Mother in Asia Minor and Crete.

As a god whom the Amazons worshipped he does not appear to have been as
important as the Mother. The records of his association with them are
few and confused. The best evidence is doubtless that furnished by the
extant accounts of the saga of Theseus and the Amazons, to which Ares
belongs, although it is not possible to define his position. The saga is
of special importance in being analogous to the Ephesian tales of
Heracles and Dionysus.

Aetolia. *Cf.* *Iliad*, 2. 536 ff.; Paus. 5. 22, 3-4; 9. 5, 1; 10. 35,

worship of Ares certainly belonged. It is a curious fact that Chalcodon,
the great Homeric hero of Euboea (*Iliad*, 2. 541), had an heroüm at
Athens in the plain where there were many memorials of the Amazons
(Plut. *Thes*. 27, 3).
