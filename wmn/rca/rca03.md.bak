# CHAPTER II

### THE GREAT MOTHER

More primitive than the worship of the gods under anthropomorphic form
is the custom of reverencing this or that deity in baetylic or aniconic
shape, a habit of religious cult for which there is ample evidence in
the writings and monuments of the Greeks. This evidence, however,
usually indicates such worship only in very early times, showing that it
gave place here and there to a more highly developed stage, that of
iconic symbolism, but there are examples of this primitive conception of
deity in late times. Conspicuous among these survivals is the worship of
Cybele under the form of the Black Stone of Pessinus in Phrygia. By
order of the Sibylline books the cult was transplanted to Rome, in 204
B.C., as a means of driving Hannibal out of Italy. <span
id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md)

Apollonius <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) represents the Amazons
engaged in ritual exactly similar to that of Pessinus--venerating a
black stone placed on an altar in an open temple situated on an island
off the coast of Colchis. The character of the worship which he depicts
makes it probable that he drew his information on this point from an
early source, especially since we learn from Diodorus <span
id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66.md) that the Amazons paid marked honour to
the Mother of the Gods, consecrating to her the island of Samothrace,
setting up her altars there, and performing magnificent

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

sacrifices. At any rate, the two passages substantiate the fact that the
Amazons were votaries of the Mother, who was known both as Rhea and as
Cybele.

One story <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md) told that Scamander
introduced the rites of the Cretan Mother into Phrygia, and that they
were firmly established at Pessinus on the Sangarius as a chief centre,
where the goddess received from the mountain ridge overhanging the city
the well-known name, Dindymene; <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md)
another account <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) had it that the
home of Phrygian Cybele's worship was in Samothrace, whence Dardanus
brought the cult to Phrygia; an attempt to rationalise the two legends
developed the tale <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) that Corybas of
Samothrace, son of Demeter and Jasion, introduced the rites of his
mother into Phrygia, and that his successors, the Corybantes of Mount
Ida in the Troad, passed over to the Cretan mountain of the same name,
in order to educate the infant Zeus. In the minds of the various writers
of antiquity to whom we are indebted for all that we know about
orgiastic cults there is such confusion that we are left in ignorance of
accurate details which would serve to distinguish sharply one cult from
another.

We are informed on several points, however, concerning the worship of
Cybele, the Great Mother of Phrygia, considered apart from other cults
similar in character and expression. Her worship at Pessinus in
particular is most important to an inquiry concerning the Amazons,
because there, attested by history, was the same baetylic form of the
goddess under which the Amazons were said to have venerated her. Roman
writers naturally, after the Black Stone had been set up in their city,
were moved by interest and curiosity to examine the legends connected
with the cult, and so it

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

happens that to these sources we owe many facts, often gleaned from the
poets of the early Empire who looked with disgust on the great vogue of
this orgiastic cult in their day. Cybele of Pessinus was served by
eunuch priests called Galli. <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) This
office of priesthood, which was considered very honourable, seems to
have commemorated the devotion of Atys to the goddess. Fortunately we
have a record <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) of the peculiar form
which the legend of Atys assumed at Pessinus. Here he was regarded as
the son of a maiden by the fruit of an almond-tree, which sprang from
the bi-sexual Agdistis. Agdistis <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md)
loved him and made him her *paredros* and Gallus. From the same source,
Pausanias, we learn the Lydian variant of the story. <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) In this he is called the son of Calaüs of
Phrygia. He established the orgies of the Mother in Lydia, in connection
with which he was so loved by the goddess that Zeus in jealousy sent a
wild boar into the fields of Lydia, which killed Atys. Both versions
show that the youth held in Cybele's mysteries a position similar to
that of Adonis with Aphrodite and of Osiris with Isis, <span
id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) but it seems to have been the peculiar
characteristic of the cult of Cybele that her companion was a Gallus.
The fact which stands out conspicuously in all the records of the
Pessinuntian rites is the service of effeminate priests, <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) who apparently represent him. In this
there is

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

probably a clue to the connection between Cretan Rhea and Phrygian
Cybele, for in the two sets of cult legends there is frequent mention of
the Dactyli, who belong both to Cretan and Trojan Ida. <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) Their evident association with metallurgy
recalls the iron sickle produced by Gaea and given to Cronus to
accomplish the overthrow of Uranus. <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md)

The underlying idea in the cult of Cybele seems to have been that of an
earth-goddess of fertility in man, beast, and field. Her worship was
accompanied by the sound of crashing drums and cymbals, the music of the
pipe, and the voices of frenzied votaries. Of her inspiration came a
form of holy madness, which endowed the worshipper with a sense of
mystic ecstasy and supernatural strength. The best extant description of
the rites is that given by Lucretius, <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) which, although it is marred by the
allegorising tendency of the poet's thought, conveys an excellent
impression of the tumultuous festival. The most awe-inspiring detail of
the ceremonies is that beneath the joy of the throng's self-surrender to
the deity there is a terrific undertone like that of the muttering
drums. The fervour of rejoicing may in a moment become the curse of
irresistible madness sent by the Mother. It is a presage of the mourning
in the Atys of Catullus: <span id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md)

Dea Magna, Dea Cybele, Dindymi Dea, Domina,  
Procul a mea tuus sit furor omnis, hera, domo:  
Alios age incitatos: alios age rabidos!"

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

Ancient notices speak of other priests of Cybele, less important than
the Galli. These were the Cybebi and Metragyrtae, <span
id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) mendicant friars, whose machinations at
Rome were scorned by Juvenal. <span id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md)

In the cult legends the Galli of history are probably represented by the
Corybantes, about whom there is much confusion. At times they seem to
belong only to Cybele's rites, at other times they are completely
identified with the Curetes. Probably the tales of Corybantes and
Curetes preserve the record of primitive armed dances of religious
character, in honour of Phrygian Cybele and Cretan Rhea respectively. As
the two deities are essentially the same, <span
id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md) so the hoplite attendants of the one are
practically the same as those of the other. As each cult assumed local
individuality, the myths concerning the Corybantes would gradually
appear to be quite distinct from those about the Curetes. Naturally,
only an initiate in the mysteries attached to either cult would possess
accurate information on details, and his lips would be inevitably sealed
on all important points, so that posterity must be content to remain
puzzled by remarks like this of Pausanias: <span
id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) "In lineage the Corybantes are different
from the Curetes, but, although I know the truth about both, I pass it
over." Unfortunately certain writings by Epimenides <span
id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) which might have proved highly
satisfactory to modern

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

inquiry have perished. In the actual ceremonies performed at Cybele's
shrines the original warlike character <span
id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) was almost lost in the mystic frenzy
which found expression in noisy shouting and self-affliction, but it is
doubtless to be traced in the measured beating of drums, the clashing of
cymbals, and the music of the pipe, which set the rhythm for the
ecstatic motions of the worshippers. It was expressed also in the
political and warlike aspect of the goddess thus adored. <span
id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) The Cretan legends told that the Phrygian
Corybantes were summoned to the island, where by beating their shields
with their swords they drowned the cries of the new-born Zeus from the
ears of his jealous father, and so originated the Pyrrhic dance in which
the later Curetes honoured Rhea, by moving to and fro in measured time,
nodding their crested helmets, and striking their shields. <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md)

The Curetes are, moreover, confounded with the Dactyli, who are usually
given as five in number,--Heracles, Paeonius, Epimedes, Jasion, and
Idas, <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md)--the metallurgists of Cretan
and

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

Trojan Ida, also with the mysterious Ἄνακτες παῖδες, who are either the
Dioscuri or the Cabiri. <span id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) Idas is the
name, not only of a Curete, but likewise of one of the Messenian rivals
and counterparts of the Spartan Διόσκουροι; <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) Jasion is the name of the mortal whom
Demeter loved in Crete, <span id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md) and who
with her belongs to the mysteries of Samothrace; the Dactyl Heracles,
whom Pausanias <span id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md) carefully
distinguishes from Alcmena's son, is by this writer <span
id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md) very cleverly identified with the deity
of this name worshipped at Erythrae in Ionia, at Tyre, and even at
Mycalessus in Boeotia. The Cabiri, being confounded with the Dactyli,
are brought into close relation to the Curetes. On the other hand, they
are confused with the Corybantes through Corybas, son of Jasion and
Demeter, who was said to have introduced his mother's worship into
Phrygia from Samothrace. <span id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md)

Of the Cabiric mysteries very little can be said with certainty, except
that Demeter was here revered as the mother of Plutus by Jasion.
Herodotus, <span id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) himself an initiate,
believes the mysteries of Samothrace to be of Pelasgic origin. He hints
at a connection between these rites and the Pelasgians' introducing
herms at Athens. Furthermore, he describes <span
id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) the type under which the Cabiri were
portrayed in plastic art, that of a pygmy man, precisely like the
*pataïci*, or grotesque figure-heads which the Phoenician triremes
carried. Excavations at the Cabirium in Thebes have yielded a unique
class of vases which confirm his statement. <span
id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) Their chief interest,

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

apart from the peculiarities of technique, is in the frank caricature
shown in the painted figures. The scenes are chiefly Dionysiac in
character, from which it is to be inferred that the Theban Cabirus was a
form of Dionysus, but this hardly agrees with the words of
Pausanias, <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) who uses the plural
number of the Cabiri at Thebes. He says that he is not at liberty to
reveal anything about them, nor about the acts which were performed
there in honour of the Mother, that he can only say that there was once
a city on this spot, that there were certain men called Cabiri, among
whom were Prometheus and his son, Aetnaeus, and that the mysteries were
given by Demeter to the Cabiri. This account favours Welcker's
theory <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) that the Cabiri were the
"Burners." In this capacity they would approach closely to the Dactyli.
But they are not for this reason necessarily divorced from companionship
with Dionysus, whom Pindar <span id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md) calls
the *paredros* of Demeter: Χαλκοκρότου πάρεδρον Δημήτερος. The epithet
Χαλκοκρότου shows the intimate bond between Demeter and the Mother of
the Gods. <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) Dionysus is placed
naturally at the side of the former, since his worship, in cult and in
legend, is to be classed with that of the Great Mother of Phrygia,
Rhea's double. <span id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) Demeter is
indeed, the Earth-Mother of Greece, on whose cult ideas were grafted
which

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

belonged to the ceremonial of the Mother in Phrygia and Lydia. <span
id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md)

So it is not strange that the Samothracian goddess closely approximates
the form of Cybele, and that we find the Amazons consecrating this
island to the Mother of the Gods. <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) But there is room for much conjecture
concerning the meaning of the connection between the Amazons and the
deity of Samothrace. <span id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) It is
probable that there is some bearing on this in the legend of the
settlement of Samothrace recorded by Pausanias. <span
id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) This tells that the people of Samos,
driven out by Androclus and the Ephesians, fled to this island, and
named it Samothrace in place of the older name, Dardania. The charge
which Androclus had brought against the Samian exiles was that they had
joined the Carians in plotting against the Ionians. It would appear then
that these colonists of Samothrace were bound by strong ties, probably
of blood, to the pre-Ionic population of Ephesus and its environs, by
whom the shrine of Ephesian Artemis was founded, a shrine indissolubly
connected with the Amazon tradition. <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) With these facts must be considered
the opinion of Herodotus that the Samothracian mysteries were of
Pelasgian origin.

In Samothrace there were also Corybantic rites of Hecate.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

These were performed in the Zerynthian cave, <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) from which Apollo and Artemis derived
an epithet. <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) The sacrifice of
dogs to Hecate held a prominent place in these mysteries. This
sacrificial rite is so infrequent in Greek religion that it commands
special attention wherever it is found. The Corybantic rites of
Samothrace show that Hecate of this place was closely akin to the
goddess of the same name, who was worshipped with Zeus Panamerius at
Lagina in Caria, the chief centre of her cult in Asia Minor. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) Strabo <span
id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) classes her cult as Phrygian-Thracian.
Farnell <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) comments on the close
connection between Artemis Pheraea of Thessaly and this Hecate and
suggests Thrace as the home of the cult. Some supporting evidence for
this opinion may be obtained by comparing with the statement that dogs
were offered to Hecate in Samothrace a remark of Sextus Empiricus, <span
id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) that the Thracians used this animal
for food.

In Lemnos there were similar Corybantic rites in honour of Bendis, who
is thus brought into relationship with Samothracian Cybele and her
reflex Hecate, as well as with Cretan Rhea. <span
id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) This "Great Goddess" of Lemnos is
Thracian Bendis, the fierce huntress of the two spears and the double
worship, "of the heavens and of the earth," who received human sacrifice
in her own country. <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) She entered
the Greek pantheon as Thracian Artemis, closely allied to Cybele and
Hecate. She has a counterpart in Φωσφόρος, from whom the Thracian
Bosphorus was named, a goddess in whose rites the torch has a
conspicuous place. <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md)

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

Thus a long list may be made out of female deities who show the general
characteristics of Phrygian Cybele: the Lydian Mother, Cybebe or Cybele;
Rhea of Crete; Hecate of Samothrace and Lagina; Bendis of Thrace and
Lemnos; Cappadocian Mâ; <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md)
Britomartis, or Dictynna, of Crete, who is Aphaea at Aegina; <span
id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) the Syrian goddess of
Hierapolis; <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) several forms of
Artemis,--of the Tauric Chersonese, of Brauron, of Laodicea <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) of Ephesus, <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) Artemis-Aphrodite of Persia. <span
id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) The conception common to all these is
that of a nature-goddess, whose rites are orgiastic, and whose
protection, as that of a woman-warrior, is claimed for the state. It is
probably correct to assume that Artemis Tauropolos, to whom
Diodorus <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) says that the Amazons
offered sacrifice, is a form of Cybele, presumably Tauric Artemis.
Therefore this name should be added to the list. It deserves special
prominence, because the Amazons are shown to have been her votaries. In
connection with Aphrodite, who, like Artemis, although less frequently,
was identified with the Mother, Arnobius <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) relates that in a frenzy of devotion
to this deity the daughter of a Gallus cut off her breasts, a story
strikingly reminiscent of the tradition of single-breasted Amazons, and
also suggestive of the fact

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

that there were Galli in certain forms of Aphrodite's worship. <span
id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md)

The cult of Cybele seems to have been an indigenous religion in Phrygia
and Lydia, <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) duplicated in almost
all its essential details by that of Cretan Rhea. Since the Cretan rites
of the Mother, in all probability, belonged originally to the Eteocretan
population of the island, a non-Hellenic folk apparently, who seem to
have been akin to the Asiatic folk not far away, <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) Rhea-Cybele may fairly be regarded as
the deity of a common stock in Crete, Phrygia, and Lydia. From the
circumstance that the double-axe is a religious symbol which occurs
frequently wherever there are remains of the pre-Hellenic, or "Minoan,"
civilisation of Crete and of that thence derived, the "Mycenaean," and
from the fact that in historic times this appears as the regular symbol
of various forms of the Asiatic Mother, <span
id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) there is ground for the inference that
the stock with whom the worship of Rhea-Cybele was deeply rooted was
that which predominated in Crete and the other lands where the same
brilliant culture flourished before the rise of the Hellenic states. It
is to be noted that the battle-axe of the Amazons is this very weapon,
but the point may not be pressed in this context. Herodotus, <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) it has been seen, asserted out of his
knowledge as an initiate, that the mysteries of Samothrace were of
Pelasgic origin. He undoubtedly conceived of the Pelasgians as a
non-Hellenic race who preceded the Hellenes in the occupation of Greece,
and therefore we must interpret his remarks about the *Cabiria* as
meaning that these rites were

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

instituted by a pre-Hellenic people. <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) It is tempting to identify this people
with the pre-Ionic inhabitants of Samos, who, according to
Pausanias, <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) settled Samothrace.
Thus the worshippers of Cybele in Samothrace would be shown to be akin
to the stock who honoured her in Crete, <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) Lydia, and Phrygia.

This Mother, whose worship was widely spread under her own name and many
others, was revered by the Amazons in the primitive baetylic form of the
rites of Pessinus; as Mother of the Gods in Samothrace, where she was
identified both with Cabiric Demeter and with Hecate; as Artemis
Tauropolos, or the Tauric Virgin, who was probably a goddess of the
Thracians. <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md)

the overthrow of Cronus by Zeus. Both myths centre about the Dictaean
Cave in Crete. The worship of Dictaean Zeus seems to have belonged to
the Eteocretans (Strabo, 10. p. 478).

completely blended into one that even in early Greek writings it was
needless to discriminate between them. *Cf.* the complete identification
of Rhea with Cybele in the Homeric *Hymn to the Mother of the Gods*
(14).

<span id="fn_86"></span>[22:87](rca03.htm#fr_86.md) In the course of
excavations at Palaikastro in Crete a hymn of the Curetes was
discovered, which is dated about 300 B.C. The hymn is discussed in three
papers, *British School Annual*, 15 (1908-09): (1) Miss J. E. Harrison
(pp. 308-338), "The Kouretes and Zeus Kouros: A Study in Pre-historic
Sociology"; (2) R. C. Bosanquet (pp. 339-356), Text of the Hymn and
certain religious aspects, "The Cult of Diktaean Zeus" and "The Cult of
the Kouretes"; (3) Gilbert Murray (pp. 356-365), Restored Text,
Translation, and Commentary. Miss Harrison's study is under these
headings: "1. The Kouretes as Δαίμονες and Πρόπολοι; 2. The Kouretes as
Magicians, as Μάντεις and Metallurgists; 3. The Kouretes as armed
Ὀρχηστῆρες; 4. The Kouretes as Φύλακες andΠαιδοτρόφοι; 5. Zagreus and
the Thunder-Rites; 6. The Kouros as Year-God; 7. The Kouretes as
Ὀργιοφάνται." The three articles form a very valuable contribution to
the study of orgiastic cults and kindred subjects.

Demeter all the attributes of Rhea. Apollodorus tells (3. 5, 1) that
Dionysus, driven mad by Hera, was cured by Rhea at Cybela in Phrygia,
and that he received from her woman's attire.

*Cf.* also the history of the Metroüm at Athens, which was in earlier
times a temple of Eleusinian Demeter (Arrian, *A. O*; Hesych. *s.v.*

<span id="fn_121"></span>[27:122](rca03.htm#fr_121) Pausanias (3. 16, 8.md)
identifies Artemis Taurica, Artemis Brauronia, and the goddess of
Laodicea in Syria. He also says that the original image of this cult was

latter on the borders of the Euxine, the Lydians--who called it
*Anaiitis*--, the Spartans--who called it *Orthia*.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[29:134](rca03.htm#fr_133.md) The central point of
the mysteries of Samothrace seems to have been the worship of Demeter as
the mother of Plutus. It is interesting to note that this son was born
in Crete (Hes. *Theog*. 970).

and the conception of the goddess on which Euripides builds his
*Iphigeneia among the Taurians*. Possibly the word Ταυρόπολος is to be
connected with *Taurobolium*, the mystic baptism in blood, which was
originally connected with Syrian cults, especially with that of Mithras.
In the first half of the second century A.D. it was introduced at Rome
as a feature of the worship of *Magna Mater*. On the *Taurobolia* and
the similar *Criobolia* *cf.* Prudent. *Peristeph*. 10. 1011-1050.
