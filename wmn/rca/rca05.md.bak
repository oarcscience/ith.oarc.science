# CHAPTER IV

### ARTEMIS ASTRATEIA AND APOLLO AMAZONIUS

Pausanias <span id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) says that there were
two ways of accounting for the name of the town Pyrrhichus in southern
Greece. One derived it from Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, the other, from
Pyrrhichus, a god of "the so-called Curetes." There was also a local
story that the town was settled by Silenus from Malea. Pausanias adds
that the people about Malea explained how Silenus came to be called
Pyrrhichus also, but he does not give the explanation. He concludes his
remarks about the town with these words: "In the market-place there is a
well of water which they believe was given to them by Silenus. There
would be a dearth of water, if this well should fail. The gods who have
sanctuaries in their land are Artemis, surnamed Astrateia, because the
Amazons here ceased their forward march, and Apollo Amazonius. The
statues are both *xoana*, and they say that they were set up by the
women from the Thermodon."

Thus the sole mention of these two cult-epithets, presumably of great
value to the investigator of the Amazon tradition, occurs in a passage
which offers no help toward understanding them and in a puzzling
context. It is strange to hear of the Amazons in Laconia, a canton in no
way associated with the stock tale, as we know it, of the invasion of
Attica. The few words in Pausanias suggest that the legend at Pyrrhichus
told of the halting of a large army. In this it would differ from the
Boeotian tradition <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) of a small
band of Amazons separated from the rest in their rout by Theseus. There
is no

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

mention of a goal, whether Athens or Troezen, toward which the army that
halted in Laconia were directing their campaign.

It seems natural to name Apollo and Artemis together, yet the Artemis of
Ephesus, with whom the Amazons were closely associated, and Artemis
Tauropolos, also mentioned as a goddess whom they worshipped, are in no
way like the companion of the Hellenic Apollo. The obvious course of
reasoning is to assume that Astrateia is the Asiatic Artemis and that,
therefore, Apollo Amazonius is fundamentally a non-Hellenic god.

Although Apollo is pre-eminently a Greek divinity, the same name was
used of a god worshipped in the Troad before the times of the earliest
Aeolic colonisation. The only attributes of this deity, whose epithet
was Smintheus, were the bow and the gift of prophecy. <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) Throughout the *Iliad* Apollo appears
as a Trojan rather than a Greek ally, a fact not without significance to
this inquiry. Cicero <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) mentions
three gods called Apollo: the son of Hephaestus and Athena, the son of
Corybas, and the son of Zeus and Leto. Of the second, who would seem to
belong to cults related to that of the Mother, it was said that he was
born in Crete, and that he contended with Zeus himself for the
possession of the island. He is elsewhere called a son of Corybas, but
this is the only reference to his struggle with Zeus. <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) This Apollo might appropriately be
paired with an Artemis of the type of Ephesia. The sole hint at a ritual
relation between Artemis and Apollo at Ephesus is in the inscription
quoted above, <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) which records

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

the dedication of a statue of "the Cretan Lady of Ephesus, the
Light-Bearer" to Apollo, "Healer of diseases and Giver of Light to
mortals." It was found to be not improbable that the Cretan Lady was the
goddess whom the Lycians worshipped under the type of Ephesia, and to
whom as Λυκεία Hippolytus dedicated a temple at Troezen. Sophocles <span
id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) emphasises the bow as the attribute of
Apollo Λύκειος, the companion of Artemis of Lycia. With this should be
considered the fact that Apollo had three oracular shrines in Asia
Minor,--at Branchidae, Clarus, and Patara in Lycia. Then the gift of
prophecy as well as the bow, the two attributes of Apollo Smintheus may
both be assigned to the Lycian Apollo. The hypothesis may be stated:
that the Phrygian-Lycian Apollo, closely allied to Artemis Λυκεία, the
Lycian type of Ephesia, is Apollo Amazonius. The theory tends to
reconcile two conflicting statements, the one that of Pindar, <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) who represents Apollo as friendly to
the Amazons, the other that of Macrobius, <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) who tells that he assisted Theseus and
Heracles against them. Apollo, conceived as the Hellenic god, would
naturally be their enemy, while the Asiatic Apollo would be their
patron. It is possible to explain in the same way the seeming
inconsistency shown in representing the defeat of the Amazons on the
walls of the temple at Bassae.

It has been assumed in the preceding paragraph that Artemis Astrateia,
because she is a goddess of the Amazons, is practically identical with
Ephesia, and on this assumption an hypothetical interpretation of Apollo
Amazonius has been based. In order that the investigation may be pursued
from a different point of view, this argument may be dismissed for the
present, to give place to an inquiry concerning the meaning

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

of Astrateia. Farnell <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) does not
discuss the epithet Amazonius, but for Astrateia he proposes the
explanation that the word is a linguistic corruption for Astarte. By
this theory the connection with a στρατεία denotes only a local attempt
to account for a word of which the real significance was completely
lost. The position of Pyrrhichus on the Laconian coast makes it easily
credible that foreign influences might have imported the Semitic
goddess. As the theory is put forward tentatively, details are not
elaborated, and so it is not stated whether there is any reason other
than caprice for connecting the Amazons, rather than another army, with
the imaginary στρατεία. Rouse <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md)
accepts the statement of Pausanias as it stands and renders the phrase
"Artemis of the War-host."

If Astrateia be "Artemis of the War-host," she was presumably an armed
goddess. Pausanias <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) records that
there was a statue of Artemis in Messenia bearing shield and spear. At
Laodicea there was the conception of an armed Artemis, as shown by
coins, and since the Laodiceans claimed to possess the original cult
statue of the Brauronian goddess, <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) who was identified with the Tauric
Virgin, <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) there is reason to
believe that these two types of Artemis, Brauronia and Taurica, depicted
her as an armed goddess. Furthermore, Artemis appears as a goddess of
battle in her cult as Agrotera, for she regularly received sacrifice
from the Spartans before a [campaign](errata.htm#0.md) or a battle; <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) at Athens the polemarch, assisted by
the ephebes, in commemoration of Marathon sacrificed annually to her in
conjunction with Enyalius; <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) and
at Aegaera in

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Achaea she was believed to have routed the
Sicyonians by telling the people of Aegaera to bind torches to the horns
of a flock of goats in order to terrify the enemy. <span
id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) Artemis Laphria, a Calydonian deity,
is possibly also a goddess of war. She is pre-eminently a huntress, and
in this respect might resemble Thracian Bendis, who entered the Greek
pantheon as Artemis. Pausanias <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md)
seems to hint that the type of Laphria is related to that of Ephesia.
Ephesia and Bendis both are forms of the Mother, who in Asia was
warlike. <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md)

But not one of these epithets of warlike Artemis is suggestive of the
word Astrateia. The nearest approach to it is in three surnames of
Aphrodite,--Strateia at Mylasa, <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md)
Strategis at Paros, <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) and
Stratonikis at Smyrna, <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) of which
the first is startlingly similar to the one under consideration. The
only epithet among those used of Artemis which calls Astrateia is
Hegemone.

Artemis Hegemone was worshipped at Tegea, at Sparta, and near Acacesium
in Arcadia. About her cult at Tegea there is nothing told which would
differentiate this from other types. <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) At Sparta she was worshipped with
Eileithyia and Apollo Carneüs in a shrine near the *Dromos*. <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) Eileithyia seems to have been a
primitive goddess, whose worship was pre-Hellenic, and who in classical
Greek times was identified with Artemis as helper of women in
travail. <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) The torch was

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

prominent in her ritual. Apollo Carneüs is generally known as the patron
of the Dorian race. There are frequent notices of him in ancient
literature as the god of the conquering people of Lacedaemon, a warrior
who, like Mars at Rome, presides also over the flocks and herds. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) Yet Pausanias <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) tells a story which makes it highly
probable that among the pre-Dorian folk of Sparta there was a god of
prophecy whose worship was grafted on that of Hellenic Apollo, whence
there was formed the type of Carneüs. Pausanias distinguishes between a
man named Carneüs and Apollo Carneüs. The former, who was surnamed
Οἰκέτας, lived in pre-Dorian Sparta, and was highly honoured in the
family of a prophet named Crius. In Dorian times there was a prophet of
an Acarnanian family who was killed at Sparta by Hippotes. Apollo
therefore was wrathful, and the Dorians exiled the criminal and atoned
for the murder. The cult name of Apollo Carneüs was formed from the name
of this Acarnanian prophet. It will be observed that in both legends
there is mention of prophecy, a fact strongly suggestive of the Phrygian
Apollo. Pausanias in this context relates a third story which brings
Apollo Carneüs into direct connection with Troy. He tells that when the
Greeks were making the wooden horse, they used wood of a cornel-tree
(κράνεια) cut in the sacred grove of Apollo. As soon as they learned
that the god was angry at their presumption they propitiated him under
the name Carneüs. It seems not unreasonable to infer from these three
legends that, although Apollo Carneüs came to be regarded as the
Dorians' god, he was in a measure identical with the prophet-god of
Phrygia and Lycia. The inference is strengthened

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

by a fourth account in the same context. In this Pausanias quotes
Praxilla, who said that Carneüs was from Crete, since he was the son of
Europa and Zeus, foster-child of Apollo and Leto. In further support of
the theory, here stated tentatively, it should be added that Acarnania,
the home of the prophet who was killed at Sparta by the Dorians, was the
country of the Curetes, conceived as one of the pre-Hellenic races of
Greece. <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) Their name points to
Crete. It must also be said that many believed Eileithyia to be of
Cretan origin. <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) Thus Eileithyia,
the third in the group worshipped at Sparta, may have been connected
with the cult of the Apollo of Phrygia, Lycia, and Crete. In the shrine
of Artemis Hegemone near Acacesium the cult statue showed the goddess
with torches in her hands. <span id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) This
temple gave access to the sanctuary of Despoena <span
id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) in which Demeter was worshipped as the
mother of Despoena. The cult legend made Artemis the child of Demeter
rather than of Leto. Therefore beside the throne of Demeter there was a
statue of Artemis, who was represented as a huntress with quiver,
hunting dog, and a mantle of stag's skin. In one hand she carried a
torch, in the other two serpents. Since the temple of Artemis Hegemone
gave access to this shrine, and since in the attribute of the torch the
statue in the inner sanctuary resembled that in the outer temple, it
seems probable that the Artemis of the Despoena temple was Artemis
Hegemone. In this sanctuary the Great Mother was worshipped with Demeter
and Despoena, and the initiates heard holy tales about the
Titanes, <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) Curetes, and
Corybantes, all of whom were connected with Corybantes, all of whom were
connected with

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

orgiastic rites--the first, with those of Dionysus, the second and
third, with those of Rhea-Cybele. It would follow that Artemis Hegemone
belonged to the circle of deities honoured by mystic ceremonies like
those of Crete and Asia Minor. Miss Harrison <span
id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) mentions the torch as a conspicuous
feature in the cult of Artemis Hegemone and connects her closely with
Hecate who was Φωσφόρος; on the shores of the Thracian Bosphorus. The
identification between Hecate and the Mother has already been
noticed. <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md)

The investigation of Hegemone as an epithet would be incomplete without
the mention of the use of the word in three other instances: alone, as
the name of a goddess; as surname of Aphrodite; in adjectival form
Ἠγεμόνιος; as an epithet of Hermes. The first of these shows Hegemone as
the name of one of the divinities by whom the Athenian ephebes swore:
"Be ye judges of the oath, Agraulus, Enyalius, Ares, Zeus, Thallo, Auxo,
Hegemone." <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) Agraulus, Thallo,
Auxo, and Hegemone appear to have been old deities of the soil.
Pausanias <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) gives Thallo as one of
the two Horae whom the Athenians worshipped with Pandrosus. He gives
Auxo and Hegemone as the two Charites who had been revered at Athens
from of old ἐκ παλαιοῦ) <span id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) The
evidence for the worship of Aphrodite Hegemone is an altar basis found
on the Acropolis at Athens with the inscription: Ἀφροδίτῃ ἡγεμόνῃ τοῦ
δήμου. <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) Epigraphical evidence
also furnishes the epithet Hegemonius with Hermes. The inscription <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) comes from the

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

site of the Metroüm at the Piraeus, where Atys was worshipped with the
Mother, and it is therefore presumable that this Hermes belongs in some
way to this Asiatic cult.

It is possible to interpret Hegemone as an epithet indicating warlike
character. The phrase, "leader of the people," applied to Aphrodite at
Athens, suggests this. The Hegemone whom the ephebes invoked may have
been regarded as such a leader. That as a Charis she was a primitive
goddess of the soil tends to support the theory, inasmuch as early
divinities are frequently both givers of fertility and protectors of
their people in battle. It has been seen that this was the case with
Apollo Carneüs at Sparta. It is noteworthy that there he was associated
with Artemis Hegemone. This combination of qualities is displayed by the
Great Mother and those resembling her. It has been noted that the
Arcadian cult of Artemis Hegemone was in some way closely related to
that of Despoena, a goddess whose rites were connected with the
Corybantic rites of Demeter and the Asiatic Mother. Furthermore, the
likeness between Artemis Hegemone and Hecate confirms the theory.

But whether Artemis Hegemone gained her epithet from a warlike character
or not, she is undeniably a goddess whose attribute was the torch, and
in this she approaches several of those forms of Artemis which are
admitted to be martial. <span id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) Artemis
Agrotera was a huntress like the Artemis, probably Hegemone, beside the
throne of Demeter in the sanctuary of Despoena. Like her, and also like
the Artemis of the outer shrine, who was certainly Artemis Hegemone, she
was a goddess of the torch. The fact comes out in the story of the rout
of the Sicyonian army at Aegaera. In the version which the
Pseudo-Plutarch gives of the ceremony in which the Polemarch and ephebes
sacrificed at Athens in memory of Marathon he substitutes Hecate for
Artemis Agrotera, the name given by

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Pollux. Artemis Laphria, who seems to have
resembled Ephesia, was honoured at Patrae in Achaea in an annual
festival of fire. <span id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) Into an
enclosure about her altar all sorts of wild beasts were driven to be
burned alive. Like Agrotera, and, presumably, like Hegemone, she was a
huntress. Another huntress was Thracian Bendis, who was nearly related
to Hecate and the Mother, and who was taken over by the Greeks as a form
of Artemis. Her rites required torches. <span
id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md)

The torch does not appear as a feature in the Hellenic worship of
Artemis until the fifth century B.C. After that its connection with the
cult becomes steadily more and more prominent. Its association with this
goddess may be traced historically to the influence of orgiastic rituals
from Thrace and Asia Minor, like those of the Mother and Dionysus, and
it is to be explained by the tendency to identify Artemis with various
forms of *Magna Mater*. <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) The
inference is inevitable that the three types of Artemis,--Agrotera,
Hegemone, and Laphria--approach one which may be called
Thracian-Phrygian, probably that of Hecate, in so far as she is similar
to Cybele. These three forms of Artemis are warlike in character, but it
is impossible to state with certainty that any one of them was
represented in the cult image as an armed goddess. Such a statement can
be made only of the statue of Artemis at Laodicea and of that which
Pausanias saw at Messene. We possess no further record of the latter,
but we are practically sure that the former was the type surnamed
Taurica and Brauronia. <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) Since the
home of this cult was the Tauric Chersonese, where the goddess was
called the Virgin, the type must be classed as Thracian, and since it
resembles that of Rhea-Cybele and Artemis Ephesia, it may properly be
called Thracian-Phrygian. Thus not only the forms of Artemis

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

which imply a warlike character, but also those which represented her
armed, indicate that the cult came from the countries where the chief
deity was a woman, both Mother and Warrior. It follows, that if Artemis
Astrateia be Artemis "of the War-host," she is closely akin to the type
of the Mother. In other words, she is, as it was at first conjectured,
very like Ephesia and Tauropolos.

It remains to consider the possibility that she is Astarte. Cicero <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) remarks that Astarte of Syria was
identified with Aphrodite, and that in this conception she appears as
the wife of Adonis. Herein the type of Aphrodite approximates that of
Cybele in Lydia and Phrygia where Atys corresponds to Adonis. At
Hierapolis the Syrian goddess described by the Pseudo-Lucian has
characteristics of Artemis as well as Aphrodite. In these rites the
torch was a prominent feature, as in those of the Thracian-Phrygian
Mother. Thus Artemis Astarte might be precisely the same as Warlike
Artemis. Moreover, even if the goddess at Pyrrhichus were an Astarte
more similar to Aphrodite than to Artemis, the probabilities would be
strong in favour of the theory that she was armed, for the cult epithet
of Aphrodite-Astarte in Greek religion was Urania, of whom there is
reason to believe that she was the armed Aphrodite. <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) So from two hypotheses, the one, that
Artemis Astrateia is Warlike Artemis, the other, that she is
Astarte, <span id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) the inference is to be
drawn that the image at Pyrrhichus showed her armed.

On the assumption that the goddess was armed it is reasonable to suppose
that an armed god was grouped with her. It is easy to imagine the
Hellenic Apollo defending his people,

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

inspiring them with courage, and visiting their enemies with pestilence,
yet he is not a truly martial deity under any one of these conceptions.
However, his worship at Sparta as Carneüs has reminiscence of a time
when he was regarded as a fighting god. Comment has already been
made <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) on the indications that
Carneüs was a pre-Dorian divinity of prophecy whom the Hellenes
identified with their Apollo. The Phrygian god to whom he was very
possibly related was a warrior in so far as the bow was as fixedly his
attribute as the mantic gift. Near Sparta there was the shrine of
another Apollo <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) portrayed in rude
and primitive fashion in the form of a colossal bronze column, to which
were added the head, hands, and feet of a man. The figure wore a helmet,
and in his hands he carried spear and bow. Amyclae, the village to which
his sanctuary belonged, was one of the pre-Dorian cities which had held
out valiantly, but had finally been devastated by the invaders. <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) Here there was preserved down to the
time of Pausanias a sanctuary of Alexandra, so-called by the Amyclaeans,
who was said to be Priam's daughter Cassandra. <span
id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) At Leuctra in Laconia this Alexandra
had a temple and image, and here there were *xoana* of Apollo Carneüs,
"made after the custom of the Lacedaemonians of Sparta." <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) Cassandra is conspicuously a
prophetess who belongs to Troy and to Trojan Apollo, and therefore a
relation between her cult and that of Carneüs, a god who seems to have
been originally identical with the prophetic Apollo of Phrygia, Lycia,
and

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Crete, <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md)
is natural. Apollo Amyclaeus resembles this Cretan-Asiatic Apollo in the
attribute of the bow, and the helmet and spear betray his relation to
Apollo Carneüs. Moreover, since at Leuctra in Laconia there was
evidently a connection between the rites of Cassandra and Apollo
Carneüs, the inference may be drawn that at Amyclae she stood in ritual
relation to the local god. It would follow that Apollo Amyclaeus was in
some way a prophet, and thus in another detail Amyclaeus resembles the
pre-Dorian Carneüs. The festival of the *Hyacinthia*, which belonged to
the Amyclaean cult, gave temporary freedom to the slaves of the region
about Sparta and was a great holiday among the humbler freemen. It seems
probable therefore that the feast was derived from the religion of the
submerged element of the population, *i. e.* from the conquered
aborigines. In its mystic imagery of the processes of life and death
there is the hint that it was instituted in honour of a chthonic deity
of fertility. <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) The legends of
Amyclae certainly told of a period when the place was influential before
the Dorian Invasion, and so presumably the worship of Apollo Amyclaeus
was instituted by the pre-historic, or "Mycenaean," inhabitants of
Laconia, whose civilisation, revealed in the artistic remains of Vaphio
and in the myth of the royal house of Menelaus, was homogeneous with
that termed "Minoan." The chief points in the argument are that Apollo
Amyclaeus was portrayed in non-Hellenic fashion, that he was conceived,
like Carneüs, as warrior and god of fertility, and that in general
characteristics he seems to have

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

been identical with the prophet-archer worshipped in Asia and in Crete.

Thus various trains of thought converge to establish the theory that the
deities whom the Amazons were said to have introduced at Pyrrhichus were
a warrior woman and a warrior man. The former seems to have been akin to
Cybele, the Tauric Virgin, Ephesian Artemis, and others of the general
type which includes these, the latter, to the god who was worshipped by
the same pre-Hellenic peoples who evolved or perpetuated the rites of
the Mother. He is a male divinity of battle and fertility, who was
originally of secondary importance to the female. The mantic gift which
belongs to him fits in well with the clamour which accompanied the
ceremonies of the Mother in historical times and with the sense of
possession by divine power which seized upon her worshippers. As
Aeschylus clearly shows in the character of Cassandra, the skill of
prophecy is divine madness. Frenzy was prominent in all orgiastic cults.

With the thought in mind that Artemis Astrateia and Apollo Amazonius are
gods of the race who lived in Laconia before the Hellenes, it is
important to examine the brief account which Pausanias furnishes of
Pyrrhichus. <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) The town was said to
have been named either from Pyrrhus or from Pyrrhichus, the latter a god
of the so-called Curetes. It is natural that the epic tales about the
house of Menelaus at Sparta should have been in vogue elsewhere in
Laconia. Therefore the story of the coming of Pyrrhus to wed Hermione
was associated with Pyrrhichus and also with Scyra <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) on a river not far away. Pausanias,
however, puts more confidence in the other account of the name of the
town.

The theory that Pyrrhichus was a god of the so-called Curetes implies
that these are here conceived to be a primitive

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

folk. The only region of Greece to which an early people of this name
may be assigned with certainty is the land north of the Corinthian gulf.
Apollodorus <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) states that the
older name of Aetolia, regarded as the tract extending from the Evenus
to the Acheloüs, was Curetis, and Pausanias <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) tells that the Curetes were the
earliest inhabitants of Acarnania. In the legend of Meleager, as it is
preserved in the *Iliad*, <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) the
Curetes are shown besieging Calydon, the Aetolians' city. The dispute
had arisen over the division of the spoils of the famous boar-hunt. The
death of Meleager, who gives his life for the city, is ascribed in the
Homeric version to the prayers of his mother Althaea, who had cried on
Hades and Persephone to destroy him in vengeance for his having slain
her brother, a prince of the Curetes. Pausanias <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) quotes the Eoeae of Hesiod and the
*Minyad* as authorities for the statement that he was killed by Apollo,
the patron of the Curetes against the Aetolians. In the Homeric story
there is a hint that Apollo was unfriendly to the Calydonians. This is
in the reference to the presumption of Idas, who attempted to shoot
Apollo who had ravished his wife Marpessa. By Idas she was mother of
Cleopatra, the wife of Meleager. Heroic legend shows many connections
between this region of Acarnania and Aetolia and that of Messenia and
Laconia. At the Calydonian chase, in which the Curetes and Aetolians
were allies, Idas and Lynceus of Messenia and their Laconian cousins and
rivals, Castor and Polydeuces, were among the assembled chiefs who took
part. <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) Idas was connected with
the house of Calydon by marriage with Marpessa. <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) Thestius,

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

brother to Marpessa's father and king of Pleuron, the city of the
Curetes, married his daughter Althaea to Oeneus of Calydon <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) and his daughter Leda to Tyndareus of
Sparta. <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) Thus the Dioscuri,
Leda's children, were related to the Curetes of northern Greece. These
genealogies originated doubtless in racial affinities between the
pre-Dorians of Laconia and Messenia and the early folk of Acarnania and
Aetolia. In pre-historic times Messenia and Laconia seem to have been
one country, founded by Lelex, locally known as an autochthon, and its
name was Lelegia. <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) The Dioscuri
were worshipped from of old both in Messenia and in Laconia as θεοὶ
μεγάλοι, and as such they were easily confused with the Cabiri and also
with the Idaean Dactyli. <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) Thus
the argument leads to a connection between this folk called Curetes and
the people among whom the orgiastic worship of the Mother was
indigenous, and so it seems natural that the armed dancers who attended
Cretan Rhea should have been named Curetes. The mention of the Leleges
in Laconia and Messenia establishes direct connections with the
pre-historic "Aegean" civilisation, which was tributary to the "Minoan,"
and also with the early races by whom the sanctuary of Ephesian Artemis
was founded. <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md)

There are the same implications in the statement <span
id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) that Pyrrhichus, a god of these
Curetes, was another name for Silenus. The oldest and most persistent
legends in regard to Silenus connect him with the country about the
Maeander in Phrygia. <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) He belongs
to the rites of Dionysus, which were intimately related to those of the
Mother. The Cabiric

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

mysteries probably combined the cult of a form of the Mother with that
of Dionysus, whence arose the story that Dionysus was the son of
Cabirus. <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) Dioscuri, Cabiri,
Anaces, Dactyli are all in a certain sense the same. Hence we may think
of this Pyrrhichus as a pre-Dorian, or "Lelegian," member of the circle
of deities among whom the Mother was chief. He was probably at once
Cabirus, Dactyl, and armed dancer. That he was the last is implied not
only by his place among the Curetes, but also by the fact that his name
is that of the famous dance at Sparta. <span
id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md)

The study of the Curetes of Laconia yields evidence in accord with that
gathered from other courses of reasoning adopted above. The forerunners
of the Hellenes in Laconia seem to have been akin to the people of
Acarnania, where Apollo was the patron of the Curetes, the original home
of the prophet Carneüs. They seem also to have been related to the race
who worshipped the Mother under the type of the goddess of Ephesus.

It must be concluded, therefore, that Artemis Astrateia was a form of
Ephesia, and that Apollo Amazonius was the prophet-archer who was
worshipped with her at Ephesus, and whose cult belonged to Phrygians,
Lycians, Cretans, and the pre-Hellenic folk of Greece.

There was a dispute between Amyclae and Mycenae, each of them claiming
to possess the tomb of Cassandra (Paus. 2. 16, 6). The word Alexandra
suggests the Trojan name of Paris. It implies a woman warrior, or one
averse to marriage. In the latter connotation it suggests Cassandra's
refusal to marry Apollo after she had obtained from him the gift of
prophecy; it suggests also the other famous story of the sacrilege of
Ajax.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[52:245](rca05.htm#fr_244.md) From the *Agamemnon*
of Aeschylus it is to be inferred that the cult epithets of Trojan
Apollo were Loxias and Agyieus, the names by which Cassandra cries to
him. Loxias has the same significance, *Eumen*. 19.

myth Hyacinthus was the son of Amyclas, one of the autochthonous kings
of Sparta. He became the favourite of Apollo, by whom he was
accidentally slain. The legend presents parallels to the story of
Agdistis and Atys and that of Aphrodite and Adonis. On the tale *v*.
Paus. 3. 1, 3; 3. 10, 1. A legend of Salamis connected the origin of the
hyacinth with the death of Ajax.

dance cures the Proetides whom Dionysus has driven mad (Apollod. 2. 3,
7), and that by some theologians Melampus was reckoned as a Dioscurus
along with Alco and Tmolus, sons of Atreus (Cic. *De Nat. Deor.* 3. 21,
53). Dionysus himself was sometimes classed as a Dioscurus, *i. e.* at
Athens in the worship of the Anaces (Cic. *l. c.*).
