# CONCLUSION

The Amazons were votaries of Cybele, Artemis under the surnames Ephesia,
Tauropolos, Lyceia, and Astrateia, Apollo called Amazonian, and Ares.
The striking feature of the list is the homogeneity of its components.
This is no fortuitous circumstance, for the authors from whom it has
been compiled are many, and they belong to widely separated generations.
The list represents classical opinion, both Greek and Latin, on the
nature of the divinities whom the Amazons were conceived to have served.
It must be concluded that these women were associated with the cults of
primitive deities of fertility and of war, among whom a Woman was the
chief figure, and of whom the rites were orgiastic. In historical times
such cults may be classed as Thracian-Phrygian, and they are to be
referred to the people who inherited both the blood and the spiritual
traditions of the great pre-historic civilisation of the Aegean basin,
of which the brilliant centre seems to have been Crete.

The theories concerning the Amazons which have commanded most respect
are three: (1) that the tradition arose from memories of the raids of
warlike women of the Cimmerians and kindred peoples, who in early times
forced their way into Asia Minor from the north; (2) that the Amazons
were originally the warrior-priestesses, or hieroduli, of the
Hittite-Cappadocian Mâ, and that the Hittites passed on legends about
them to the people of Lycia, Lydia, and adjoining lands; (3) that the
tradition of the Amazons was grounded on the mistaken notion, deeply
rooted among the Greeks, that beardlessness is a sure indication of
female sex, whence they failed to recognise as men certain warriors who
appeared at an early date as foes of the people of Asia Minor. To the

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

first <span id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md) of these it is to be
objected--irrespective of evidence furnished by the cults with which the
Amazons were associated--that a northern home beyond the Euxine was
assigned to the race by Aeschylus and Herodotus, but that the oldest
records of the Greeks, the Homeric poems, place them near Lycia and
Phrygia. In this region the tradition struck down into the soil, as
shown by the tales of many cities claiming the Amazons as their
founders. To the second <span id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) it must
be replied that Mâ is nowhere named in direct connection with the
Amazons, although she resembles in a general way the female deities whom
they were said to have worshipped. Furthermore, in the records of her
rites there is no hint of armed hieroduli. <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md) And, still further, the evidence on
which the assumption rests that the Hittite kingdom was one of great
importance and influence is not strong. The last theory <span
id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) is very interesting, because it is
novel and daring, and also because it draws attention to certain curious
facts usually overlooked by anthropologists. But as a foundation for the
persistent tradition of the Amazons as armed women it is too slight in
structure.

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

The tradition, interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by the
cults which they are supposed to have practised, seems to have
originated among the people who built up the prehistoric civilisation of
the Aegean, of which the finished product was apparently "Minoan"
culture. In their warlike character the Amazons are reflexes of the
Woman whom they worshipped. Like the Warrior Goddess of Asia Minor they
carry the battle-axe, and in this they are shown to be closely related
to the religion of pre-historic Crete, of which the weapon is the
conspicuous symbol. Their other weapon, the bow, is also Cretan. <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) It is the attribute of the
Asiatic-Cretan Apollo whom they seem to have revered. They belong to the
early matriarchate, which left traces in Caria and Lycia. <span
id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) In Greece itself, even in Laconia, the
canton belonging to the fiercest of the Hellenic invaders who introduced
the patriarchate, women enjoyed unusual freedom in Greek times, and here
there were stories of their having borne arms for their country. There
were similar tales at Argos and in Arcadia, and at the Olympian Heraeum
there was a footrace of maidens in honour of Hippodamia. <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) These are doubtless vestiges of the
matriarchate of the pre-Hellenic inhabitants of Greece. They suggest
many comparisons with the Amazon tradition. The legend of Atalanta
offers similar parallels to the story of the Amazons in its pleasing
aspect. Its darker side, which the older Greeks emphasised, is reflected
in the tale of the Lemnian women who murdered their husbands. <span
id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md) These were Myrina's children and
descendants of Dionysus. The energy of this ancient matriarchal
organisation is shown in the idea of confusion of sex which belonged to
the cults of Cybele and Ephesian Artemis in historical times. The idea
is prominent

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

in the legends of the Amazons, as they touch religion. At Ephesus they
were connected with Dionysus and Heracles, to both of whom an effeminate
character belonged. Their place in state cult at Athens has the same
implications.

We may believe then that the tradition of the Amazons preserves memories
of a time when women held the important place in state and religion in
Aegean lands, and that they reflect the goddess of this civilisation. It
is noteworthy that the earliest writings of the Greeks concerning them
show them in that part of Asia Minor where the rites of the Mother
throughout ancient times menaced the reason of her worshippers. The
troop of maenads who followed Dionysus were like the Amazons, but the
clue to their kinship was easily lost. <span
id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) The relationship between the Amazons
and the Anatolian cults was practically obliterated, whereas maenads
were introduced into Greek religion after many generations had altered
the first form of orgiastic worship. Moreover, the deity of the maenads,
who was earlier only the *paredros* of the Woman, had become an
Olympian.

Greek travellers of the age of Herodotus naturally inferred that they
had discovered the Amazons in the regions of Scythia and Libya where
armed women were said to fight in the ranks with men. Even before this
time the traditional home of the race had been placed further and
further eastward, as Greek colonists failed to find Amazons in Lydia,
Phrygia, Lycia, and along the southern shore of the Euxine. Yet, granted
the origin of the Amazon tradition among the "Minoans" and their
kindred, it is at present impossible to say that these pre-historic
races had no affiliations with Scythians, Libyans, and Hittites.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_358"></span>[74:359](rca07.htm#fr_358.md) On the theory v. O.
Klügmann, *Philologus*, 30 (1870), pp. 524-556. Stoll inclines to this
theory, as shown by his article in Pauly's *Realenc*. *s.v.* Klügmann.
Other advocates are Fréret, *Mémoire de l'acad. d'inscr.* 21. pp. 106
ff.; Welcker, *Ep. Cycl.* 2. pp. 200 ff. It is sympathetically treated
in Roscher's *Lexikon*, *s.v.* *Amazonen*. Farnell seems inclined to
accept it, although he does not explicitly advance an opinion. In one
part of his work (*op. cit.* 5. p. 406) he takes the negative position
that "the Amazon tradition is sporadic in Greece and perplexes the
ethnographer and the student of religion," yet elsewhere (2. p. 482) he
makes the close connection between Ephesian Artemis and the Amazons the
basis of the suggestion that northern Asia Minor was perhaps the home of
the cult.

chief advocate of the importance of the Hittite [kingdom](errata.htm#2.md).
His most recent remarks on the Amazons are in *Proc. Soc. Bibl. Arch.*
1910, pp. 25-26. They are supported by A. J. Reinach, *Rev. Arch.* 1910,
pp. 280-282. *Cf.* Leonhard, *Hettiter u. Amazonen*, 1911.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[74:361](rca07.htm#fr_360.md) This objection is
made by Farnell, *op. cit.* 5. p. 406.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[74:362](rca07.htm#fr_361.md) This is the theory
of Myres in *Anthropology and the Classics*, pp. 138 ff. Farnell is more
satisfied with this than with the hieroduli theory (*op. cit.* 5. p.
406).

thought is in R. Y. Tyrrell's Preface to his edition of the *Bacchae* of
