# PREFACE.

A LITTLE book bearing as its title "Lives of the Greek Heroines" seems
scarcely to require a word of introduction. The women who have been made
famous by the genius of Homer, of Aeschylus, and of Sophocles, have so
stamped their noble and vigorous nature into the literature of Europe
that their names have a familiar ring in the verses, even of the modern
poet.

To give a true picture of these women and of their lives and occupations
is all that the writer of the following pages has aimed at. To have
entered on the field of comparative mythology, however inviting it may
look, would have been foreign to the purpose with which the work was
undertaken, which was to show that, whatever ideas they might or might

embody, to the poets who sung of them, the Greek Heroines were as really
and as truly *women*, with minds to think and hearts to feel, as Portia
and Lady Macbeth were to Shakespeare.

Should these pages lead any woman to study one of the finest and purest
literatures in the world, to help to clear away the notion that Classic
learning is unsuitable to women, the writer will be amply rewarded.
