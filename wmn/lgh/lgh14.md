# NOTES.

NOTE <span id="xref_1">1</span>.

Delos received Latona when she was persecuted by Hera, and no other land
would give her shelter. Phoebus Apollo and Artemis, the twin deities,
were born in the hospitable little island which was henceforth one of
the principal seats of the worship of Phoebus, who is frequently called
the Delian God.

See KEIGHTLEY'S *Mythology*, pp. 102, 103.

NOTE <span id="xref_2">2</span>.

*Moirae*. Goddesses whose office it was to assign their lot in life to
men. They are called daughters of Zeus and Themis (law), but even Zeus
himself was bound by their decrees.

See KEIGHTLEY'S *Mythology*, p. 172.

NOTE <span id="xref_3">3</span>.

*Daphne*, daughter of the Peneus, delighted in the life of a huntress;
she unhappily attracted the love of Phoebus, who would fain have made
her his wife; the frightened maid, unable to escape his pursuit, called
on her father for help, and the river god changed her into a laurel,
henceforth the sacred tree of Phoebus. The legend is very prettily told
by Ovid.

*Metamorphoses*, Book i. 1. 452.

NOTE <span id="xref_4">4</span>.

Thanatos is represented by Euripides as coming in person to claim
Alcestis. He appears to have been represented as a beautiful dusky
youth, with none of the grotesque horrors of the later ideas: he is twin
brother to Sleep.

*See* KEIGHTLEY'S *Mythology*, p. 17 7.

NOTE <span id="xref_5">5</span>.

*Zeus Zenius*. Zeus, who guarded the *Zenos*, the guest-friend, *i.e.*
the foreigner. The relation of Zenia was as sacred among the Achaeans as
among the Hebrews; the conduct of Admetus to Herakles is a beautiful
illustration of the honour paid to the stranger; Achaean and Hellenic
story abounds in similar instances.

NOTE <span id="xref_6">6</span>.

*Thamyris*.

"And Dorian where the Muses met,*  
*With Thamyris of Thrace and made him cease  
From song as from Oechalia he came,*  
*Leaving the court of Eurylus, for he*  
*Boasting, declared that he would conquer all,*  
*Yea, though the Muses sang with him themselves,*  
*Daughters of Aegis-bearing Jove, in wrath;*  
*They made him blind and took away his song,*  
*And caused him to forget his minstrelsy."  
                                   HOMER, L. II. 595-600.

 

NOTE <span id="xref_7">7</span>.

*Apian* land, the name given by Homer to the Peloponnese.

NOTE <span id="xref_8">8</span>.

*Até* (mischief), inevitable evil that pursues certain men or houses to
their ruin.

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

NOTE <span id="xref_9">9</span>.

The Clashers, literal translation of Sumplēgadĕs, the rocks at the
entrance of the Black Sea, now called the Pavorane, which from their
appearing more or less open or confined, according to the course of the
vessel, were said by the poets to open and shut upon the ships which
entered, and crush them to pieces.

MAJOR'S notes to *Medeia*.

NOTE <span id="xref_10">10</span>.

*Zeus Sōter*, the saviour or deliverer.

NOTE <span id="xref_11">11</span>.

These are the closing lines of Wordsworth's beautiful poem, "Laodamia."
