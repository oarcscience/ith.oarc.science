# HELENE.

HELENE of the flowing robe, the loveliest woman of her time, and the
cause of bitterest woe to many gallant men and true-hearted women. Who
can picture the sweetness and beauty of form and face which gathered the
Achaean princes from Messene to remote Phthia to the court of Tyndareus,
and there so bewitched them that they were willing, every man among
them, to bind themselves by oath to defend her and him whom she should
choose, against all aggression, whenever or by whomsoever they might be
wronged.

Married in her early womanhood to a husband of her own choice, who loved
her with a blind devotion, it was hard to see what was wanting to make
the lot of Helene blessed. The palace was richly adorned with all
beautiful things, and they had one little daughter, named Hermione,
almost equal to her mother in beauty. How pleasant were the hollows of
hill-girt Laconia, how sweet the flowing Eurotas to

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Helene as she wandered among them and beside it
with her little daughter! how sweet the evening hours when the little
maid was asleep, and Helene sat among her maids directing their tasks,
and herself executing works of marvellous skill and beauty. Alas! that
so fair a day should darken at its noon!

There came from beyond the sea an adventurous prince, skilled in all the
arts of war--most skilled in minstrelsy, for he could draw such sounds
from his ivory lyre that those who heard were moved to tears or stirred
to martial ardour at his will--Alexander, sometimes called Paris, son of
Priam and Hekabé, a prince of Troy. Menelaus made him royally welcome,
for he was much interested in learning the manners and customs of
foreign nations, and there was no city equal in fame and power in those
days to Troy, whose princes traced back their race in a double line to
supreme Jove, and who boasted of the special favour of Poseidon and
Apollo. Alexander was himself a young man of a most winning presence. He
had been nursed in adversity, for owing to a terrible dream by which his
mother was visited just before his birth, he had been laid upon the
mountains when an infant, and only saved from a cruel death by the pity
of a shepherd, who brought him up as his own son, until such time as he
declared his princely birth by gallant deeds in defence of the flocks
from wild beasts and marauders, and was welcomed back to the palace by
his admiring kinsfolk. Godlike Alexander, as his people loved to

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

call him, had learnt by this bringing up to be all things to all men: he
could talk of battle and ambuscades with Menelaus; he could hold Helene
and her maidens in rapt delight while he sung to them, and he had tender
words for the little Hermione; and though he tarried week after week
while his ship lay drawn up at Taenaron, he did not seem to his hosts to
tarry long, but they ever made him more and more welcome.

In an evil hour a message came from Argos from Agamemnon the king,
calling on Menelaus to keep his tryst, and go with him to hunt boars in
Arkadia. Menelaus desired to take his guest with him, but the subtle
Asiatic knew how to excuse himself without awakening suspicion. No
sooner was the king fairly gone than he set about to corrupt his queen,
and, partly by persuasion, partly by violence, he wrought upon her so
that she turned her back upon her palace and all her happy life, and
sailed with him over the seas in his Phrygian ships.

How bitter and how frequent were her self-reproaches! But was she not
the sworn votary of Aphrodite, and had not Aphrodite herself promised
her as wife to Paris? who, for his part, was also bound by strong vows
and by the memories of many happy days to Aenone, the nymph of Ida, who
had loved him when he was a solitary shepherd, making sweet music in the
glades. Weak and beautiful, better they had died, and all their winsome
graces turned to

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

loathsomeness ere they forgot their truth and honour and became a name
of desolation and misery each to his home and country!

The blue waters of the great midland sea shone beneath sun and moon, and
the flying queen almost forgot her sin in the loveliness of the sea and
the shining islands, skimming with full sails ever further and further
from Lacedaemon up northward to the great capital of the ancient king;
for Aphrodite herself had won from blustering Aeolus gentle winds, and
Hera and Athene were holden by the Fates from wreaking their vengeance
on the fugitives, that the full measure of their guilt might be made up.
Nevertheless, their voyage was not without its note of warning; for when
they were now in the midst of the blue waters, and the full moon hung
like a golden shield in the sky, the ship suddenly stood still: the
sails flapped idly against the mast, and the weary rowers toiled in
vain. A supernatural calm brooded over sea and air, and from the bosom
of the waters rose the white head of the old sea-god Nereus, with sad
and threatening aspect.

Loud and angry was his speech, for all the terrible future rose at his
bidding, and the infatuated prince heard, but heard in vain, of the
mighty warriors who should arm in the pursuit, of the desolation of
Troy, and, finally, of his own dishonoured death! Alas! for him who
enters on the path of sin; and yet again alas! for him there are no
backward steps. The avengers of his crime drive him deeper and deeper

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

into the mire, until it overwhelms him, and he passes from the ken of
man into the unknown.

When Alexander at last reached his native shore, the king and queen made
haste to receive the lady of whose matchless beauty they had heard so
much, and although they would have gladly had Helene a maid rather than
a wife, yet Priam could not but rejoice that vengeance was come at last
for his fair sister Hesione, carried away by Herakles and given to
Telamon of Salamis to be his wife; and for those other Asiatic
princesses dragged from home and country by the bold Achaean seafarers.
And who of mortal mould ever looked on the face of Helene and had the
heart to blame her? However they might blame her when she was away, no
one could withstand the witchery of her feminine grace, of her modest
looks--for she was no brazen adulteress, defying the laws she had
outraged, but a shrinking woman, foremost to heap accusations on
herself, but ever lacking the strength to do the right she knew.

Though Troy shook to her centre, and loss upon loss for ten weary years
broke the hearts of king and people; though Hektor, bravest of his race,
maintained the unequal contest, hopeless but undismayed, until his
lifeless body was dragged round the walls for which he had fought;
though the prophecy of Nereus was wrought out upon Alexander, and his
lovelocks were at last dragged in the dust,--she who was the cause of
all the woe went in and out of the palaces, weaving

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

her skilled embroideries, and not denied a place among the princesses,
though many sorrowed for her sake and eyed her askance.

But Aphrodite, her sweet patroness, fenced her round with witcheries and
love; and when at length the city was taken, and Deïphobus, the brother
of Paris, to whom on his death she had been given as wife, fell a victim
to the vengeful wrath of Menelaus, no word of blame fell on Helene's
ears; nay, she returned with him to the Achaean land his honoured queen
and wife, as though no blight had ever fallen on her, and all the blood
of Achaeans and Trojans which had mingled with the waters of Simois and
Skamander had not been shed for the sake of her fatal beauty.

Odysseus, Diomedes, Nestor, and Menelaus, first of the princes, set sail
on their return from Troy, although Agamemnon would fain have delayed
his brother for a solemn sacrifice to the displeased Athena; and thus
the brothers parted in some wrath, never again to meet on this mortal
earth.

The four kings sailed to Tenedos; there they offered a solemn sacrifice,
and all went well with them until they reached Lesbos. Here a mighty
storm overtook them, and scattered them in different directions over the
sea. Menelaus and Helene from this time forth for many years wandered
from coast to coast, visiting Cyprus, Phoenicia, Egypt, and Libya, where
the horned men abide, and where the sheep drop lambs thrice in the year.
In their voyagings they

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

gathered much art treasure, of gold and silver and needlework, and
Helene learned much medicinal skill in Egypt, the cradle of science,
from Polydamna, wife of Thon, the hospitable king of that land.

In the isle of Pharos, but a day's sail from Egypt, they were detained
by contrary winds and half famished, having nothing to subsist on but
such fish as they were able to catch, and they might have perished there
had not the gracious sea-maid Eidothea, daughter of the mighty Proteus,
taken pity on them. She taught Menelaus how to wrest from her father
such information as should enable him to rescue himself and his people
from their broiling prison.

By her direction he chose out three of the sturdiest and trustiest of
his comrades, and when the rosy dawn coloured the eastern sky, he went
down to the sea-shore, having first earnestly supplicated the gods to,
prosper his enterprise. No sooner did the Achaean warriors reach the
line of sand than from the broad bosom of the deep rose the gracious
sea-maid Eidothea, and she brought with her an unsavoury burden--four
seal-skins newly flayed. She then made hollows in the sand big enough
for the men to lie in, and she placed the men in them side by side, and
over each she drew a seal-skin, so that it looked as though four seals
lay sleeping on the shore.

Never in all his multitudinous adventures had Menelaus suffered such
misery, not though he had lain in, the womb of the wooden horse, when it
groaned and,

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

trembled beneath the spear of Laokoon, for the stench of the
newly-flayed skins, as they lay beneath them in the sunshine from dawn
till full noon, was so horrible that they could not have endured it had
not the sea-maid, beholding their misery, brought them ambrosia, the
divine perfume of which refreshed their senses and overcame the stench.

So there with heroic patience they lay until the great flock of the
seals came thronging up from the sea, and lay down to sleep upon the
beach. With them was Proteus himself, their shepherd, who having counted
the flock and finding the tale complete lay down also to sleep, never
perceiving the trick. No sooner had Proteus closed his eyes than
Menelaus and his men rushed upon him with a shout and seized him firmly,
but the old sea god, though taken unawares, did not forget his cunning.
First he became a bearded lion, then a serpent, then a leopard, then a
foaming boar; and when these monsters did not appal them, he sought to
slip from their fingers like running water. Then he became a tree
swaying in the wind, then a flame of fire; but the Achaeans, forewarned
by Eidothea, never slackened their grasp; until at length seeing his
craft availed him nothing, Proteus took again his natural form, and
demanded of Menelaus what he wanted. "Nay," said the son of Atreus, "art
not thou learned in all knowledge, seeing that thou art god and prophet;
thou knowest how we are pent in this rocky prison house and cannot by
any means win out."

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

Then Proteus bade him offer solemn sacrifice to Jove and the other gods
if he would ever see his native land again, and he told him that to be
acceptable to the Immortals this sacrifice must be offered on the banks
of the great Egyptian river. At this announcement bitter disappointment
smote the heart of Menelaus, for he had hoped that he had looked his
last upon the swarthy Nile; but he had borne disappointment too often to
murmur at the will of the gods, so he promised that he would do as
Proteus commanded him, and he took occasion to gather tidings of the
fate of the many friends he had left in Troy. Then Proteus told him,
nothing loth, of Ajax Oïleus, whose rash impiety shipwrecked him half
way to his home, of Agamemnon carried safe through the tempest by the
gracious care of Heré, but slain treacherously in his own palace by the
working of Aegisthus, his hereditary foe.

When he heard of the death of his brother, Menelaus wept sore, sitting
on the wet sea sand, so that Proteus pitied him and bade him cheer up,
for that he should find when he reached Argos that Aegisthus in his turn
was slain by the young Orestes, and should have the happiness of joining
in solemn funeral honours to his brother. Then Menelaus would know
something of his trusty friend and ally Odysseus, whether he had
succeeded in getting home to his beloved Ithaké and to the friends he
loved so dearly; but Proteus told him that he was detained sorely

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

against his will in the halls of Kalypso, daughter of Atlas, having lost
all his comrades; then turning to Menelaus himself, the god said:--

"Hast thou no desire to learn aught of thyself and of thy wife, son of
Atreus?"

"Yea, fain would I know what shall be the end of our lives and whether
we shall abide together until the end, though methinks he is a bold man
who will thrust himself into the counsels of the Moirae."

"Ay, truly is he! for what in the accomplishment is easy as sleep, in
the anticipation often seems hard as death; but do thou take comfort,
the troubles of thy life are nearly at an end, nothing shall ever
separate thee more from Helene, fairest of women, and as thou hast been
her true husband all thy life and so art son-in-law of Jove, the Styx
shall never be passed by thee, but the Immortals themselves shall
conduct thee with Helene by a path of their own to the Elysian plains;
yea, to the ends of the earth, where the auburn-haired Rhadamanthus
holds sway, and where temperate breezes from the oceany-stream maintain
the life of man in full vigour--where there is no snow, nor heavy rain,
but sweet, temperate weather all the year round."

Then Proteus, having uttered this gracious prophecy, blew his horn, and
straightway all the lithe seals began to lift their heads and to push
their huge bodies down the level sands, and with a mighty sound of
splashing water to plunge into the bosom of the deep; and when

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

they were now all gone, Proteus himself seemed to the Achaeans as they
gazed on him to vanish in a wreath of mist, his hoary hair and beard
floating on the waves till they were lost in the sea foam; and as he
vanished there arose the low sighing of a gentle wind, and the heat of
that terrible island was softened, and Menelaus went up from the shore
to where Helene waited, and gladly bade her bestir herself, for the good
wind was come which would take them back once more to the hospitable
court of Thon, where they must needs tarry to make the great sacrifice,
without which they could never see again their native land.

Then Helene gladly arose and went on ship-board; and so it was that when
the gods were duly appeased, they at length in the eighth year of their
voyaging beheld once more the longed-for Achaean shore, and the first
land that was given to their eyes was Argos, and there they learnt the
truth of the first prophecy of Proteus, how Agamemnon, being slain by
Klytaemnestra and Aegisthus, was now newly avenged by Orestes, his son.

Menelaus and Helene, grieved at the sorrows of the house, joined
Elektra, Krysothemis, and Orestes in solemn rites to Agamemnon, and in
funeral ceremonies to Klytaemnestra whose body was hidden in the earth,
and to whose angry spirit her children offered vain sacrifice; but
Aegisthus was flung out dishonoured for the birds of the air to rend and
the beasts of the field to devour.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

These sad duties rendered, Menelaus and Helene gladly turned their faces
southward; and it was given them once more to behold their stately
palace, and to hold their beloved daughter Hermione in their arms.

Here they dwelt for many days in peace and honour, and here they were
visited by many princes; among others by Telemachus, son of Odysseus,
when he was come abroad to seek news of his father; and the Ithacan
prince was so dazzled by the flash of bronze, of gold and of silver, of
amber and of ivory in the great hall of the palace, that he was unable
to control his admiration, and exclaimed in his simple way, that surely
such must be the palace of Olympian Jove.

But toil and wanderings had chastened the hearts of Menelaus and his
queen, and often as they sat, she with her distaff; he leaning on his
sceptre, clouds of great shame and sorrow darkened their minds thinking
of the years that were gone, and of the brave men whose lives had been
made miserable or prematurely ended on their account; nor were they
without a present and personal sorrow, for Hermione, their one child,
became a cause of grief and almost a quarrel to them. In his gratitude
for his great services in bringing the war to an end, Menelaus had
promised his daughter to Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, and in spite of the
en-treaties of his wife, and the aversion of the maiden, he insisted on
carrying through the nuptials; but Hermione loved not the fierce
warrior, nay, rather she loved Orestes her unhappy cousin, wandering
from

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

shore to shore, pursued by the furies of his mother, and Helene pitied
them both, and would gladly have helped them. So that when now Orestes,
being pronounced free from guilt by the dread court on the Areopagus,
made use of his freedom to seek out Neoptolemus, and, meeting him at
Delphi, there slew him, and seizing on Hermione brought her home with
him to Argos, Helene managed to soften the anger of Menelaus, and to
make him give consent to the union of the lovers.

Then in due time, before age had dimmed her beauty or weakened his manly
strength, the mysterious visitants foretold by Proteus appeared, and at
their call the king and queen arose once more--leaving their pleasant
home--but this time side by side, and departed for ever to the blessed
fields where eternal joys awaited them.
