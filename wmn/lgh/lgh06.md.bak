# ATALANTA.

"BEAR away the infant from my sight! I want no weeping girls. When thou
bringest me a sturdy boy I will give thee thy freedom and much treasure
beside, so that thou shalt be an object of envy to all thy gossips."

It was Iasius of Arcadia who spake to Eriphyle, the prudent nurse of
Klymene, his wife, who brought him the little daughter just born to him.

"Alas!" cried the nurse, trembling, "and what is to become of this sweet
innocent? Wilt thou not at least look at her? She is the very image of
thyself!"

But Iasius was sore disappointed. He had made up his mind to have a son
who should stand by him in the field and in the council, and having no
knowledge of how weak a thing a little infant is at the best, the glance
he cast at the little face which Eriphyle held up to him only made him
more angry. He would not have such a feeble creature grow up to call him
father; so he hastily called Eurubates, his trusty

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

attendant, who had many a time executed an evil command at his bidding,
and he told him to take the child and carry it to some lonely spot on
the hills, where cold and hunger would quickly make an end of it.
Perhaps if he had once taken the little maid in his arms, the tender
fatherly love which the gods have placed in the hearts of all men might
have been wakened in him; but the Moirae had willed it otherwise, who
had ordained that this feeble nursling should become a name for strength
and beauty among the nations.

Eriphyle, the nurse, returned weeping to the queen, who, robbed of her
sweet babe, had much ado to rally from her weakness, and Eurubates
carried the little maid to a cave which he knew on the side of a hill,
and there laid her softly within its shadow and turned and went quickly
away, never daring to look behind him; and at his dying day, when the
many evil deeds of his life rose before him, the vision of that royal
robe, within the folds of which he had never looked, troubled him more
than grosser deeds of violence and blood-shedding to which he had lent a
hand.

But the acts of men are not unheeded by the gods, and Artemis, the
maiden goddess, had compassion on the little forsaken child, and sent a
she-bear to the cavern of Mount Parthenius, or the Maiden Hill, as it
came to be called in later times, and the wild beast became a
nursing-mother to the infant, and warmed her with her shaggy coat, and
nourished her with her

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

rich milk, so that she grew into a sturdy child, clinging to the long
hair of her foster-mother, or trotting on all fours by her side; and
haply she might have grown up with more of brutal than human in her
temper and manners, had not Artemis taken her away and given her to her
own attendant Orythieia, to rear and to teach all the arts that become a
huntress, especially the shooting with the bow and swiftness of foot.

Under the fostering care of Orythieia, the little Atalanta (it was thus
that Artemis had named the maiden) learned to know the haunts and habits
of all woodland creatures, from the wild boar who makes his lair in the
hill-side, a terror to men, to the little field-mice that have their
homes in the mossy bank where the violets grow; every creature that had
beauty of form or colour was her playfellow--she outran the roe, and
leapt from crag to crag as strong and nimble as the wild goat; every
bird that piped upon a spray seemed to speak to Atalanta's ear, and many
a time and oft her arrow or her spear saved some tender creature of
earth or air, some brooding dove or mother deer from talon of vulture or
ravening tooth of lynx or lion.

And so the maiden grew in strength and beauty, and in the favour of the
great goddess, who perfected her, as she well deserved, in all the arts
of the huntress, and in that secret lore, the fruit of watchful
observation, in which the open-eyed children of Latona are so abundantly
skilled; but it pleased Artemis that she,

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

who was so richly endowed with special gifts, should live a chaste,
unworldly life, and leaving marriage and motherhood to the ordinary
daughters of men, should spend the years of her mortal life in high
communing with nature. In early youth this seemed to Atalanta not a
loss, but a gain; having the whole world of earth and air to claim
kindred with, what did it concern her that men and women alone were
strangers to her? And she grew so perfect and so wise, that Artemis
found it in her heart to grieve at her mortal parentage, and to desire
that she also might be one of the deathless ones.

When Atalanta was now some seventeen summers old, a cry of lamentation
rung through the Achaean land from the pleasant fields of Aetolia. A
mighty monster of a boar, sent by some angry deity (Artemis herself, it
was whispered) had made his lair close to rocky Kalydon, and neither man
nor dog was able to dislodge him. In vain the vine-dressers dressed the
vineyards, in vain the husbandmen sowed the corn; no sooner was the
gracious earth ripening her fruits, than the brute sallied forth,
rooting up the tender shoots with his tusks, and treading the grapes and
corn alike in the dust, and vine-dresser and husband-man were torn to
pieces if they attempted to guard their labours: and so sore was the
distress, and so lusty grew the boar, that the noble Oeneus, king of
Kalydon, was weary of his life, for the constant wail of the husbandmen,
of their widows and orphaned

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

children, and for the havoc wrought by that evil beast. Then he took
counsel with his son, the bright-haired Meleager, and they proclaimed a
great hunt throughout all the Achaean land, from Hellas famed for lovely
women, to pleasant Lacedaemon, lying in a hollow. And all the Achaean
land hearkened, and sent forth her brave young spirits to aid the
suffering Aetolia; and to rid the earth of that evil beast. And from
Arkadia came the maiden Atalanta, bearing her boar-spears in her hand,
and on her shoulders the skin of a spotted panther: and Oeneus and
Meleager greeted her courteously, for they knew that Artemis herself had
taught her woodcraft; but some of the chieftains were angry, and took it
ill that a girl should be thought worthy to join with men in the chase;
and especially Plexippus, the uncle of Meleager, was full of angry
scorn.

"Bring to us the distaff and the lute," he cried, contemptuously, "if
the boar-spear and the bow are come to be the tools of women. Nay,
nephew, for shame! take the damsel to the upper chamber, where Kleopatra
thy honoured wife, sits spinning among her maidens; there she will find
fit companions and worthy occupation. Surely it becomes a maiden to
weave garments for heroes, rather than to waste her feeble powers in the
battle or the chase."

"Hist! uncle; speak not so unwisely!" replied Meleager, angrily. "Wist
ye not that the great goddesses, Athena and Artemis, delight in the
battle and

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

the chase? Oeneus hath invited all skilled hunters to aid us in this our
strait, and may Zeus Zenius bring evil on my head, if I fail in my duty
as a guest-friend to this damsel who has come in answer to our summons,
and whom Artemis herself has instructed in the art of hurling the spear,
and in all things that pertain to the slaying of wild beasts."

Then all the other chieftains frankly gave in, and bade the damsel
welcome; only Plexippus remained dark and angry, waiting an occasion to
show his wrath.

It was a gallant band of hunters that went out to slay the Kalydonian
boar, for there were the twin princes Kastor and Pollux, Jason of
Pherae, Peleus of Thessaly, and many more of whom the old world was
justly proud; but among them all Atalanta stood pre-eminent by her skill
and by her beauty, and it was her spear that first drew blood by a
well-aimed blow which smote the boar in the mouth; her Meleager quickly
followed, striking the huge brute to the heart, and hero followed hero
until spears stood thick on his back and shoulders, and the creature
rolled on the plain, pouring out his life from a hundred wounds, and
fertilizing with his blood the ground he had wasted.

Then Meleager drew his sword, and cutting off the head, presented it as
the first fruits of victory to Atalanta, but Plexippus rudely snatched
it from her, declaring that it was a prize for a king, and should be

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

given to no one but to Oeneus of Kalydon, whose of right it was.

Then the wrath of Meleager flamed up, and he smote Plexippus on the
temple with his doubled fist, and the man fell as falls an ox in the
shambles when the butcher smites him, and the ruddy blood gushed from
mouth and nostrils. Consternation seized all the chieftains, none more
than Atalanta, the innocent cause of the calamity, and Meleager stood
aghast over his fallen kinsman. In vain the gracious twins lifted his
head and strove to see if there were any breath of life in him; in vain
Nestor of Pylos, the youngest man there, ran to seek a leech; the soul
had passed the ivory portals of his teeth, and Plexippus would never
utter a threat or insult more.

Meantime, tidings that the boar was slain had reached the city, and
Althaea, the queen, was coming forth with her women bearing garlands, to
do honour with dancing and with song to the victors, when, as she stood
on the threshold of the gate, one came flying, white and
horror-stricken, and told how the prince Plexippus was slain.

"Ah! woe is me!" exclaimed the queen; "how slain? I heard the boar was
dead, but wist not that he had given my brother his death wound."

"Alas! lady, it was not by the boar that the noble Plexippus was slain,
it was Prince Meleager who wished to give the first fruits of the
victory to the strange Arkadian huntress, but Plexippus would not

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

have it, and Meleager was wrathful and smote him, so that he died."

"My son slew my brother for the sake of the foreign woman I" shrieked
the queen. "But Plexippus shall not die unavenged; the soul of my
mother's son shall be appeased!"

And scarce knowing what she did, Althaea rushed to the chamber where her
choice treasure was laid up, and turning the key in the great cedar
chest, where many rich garments and costly ornaments were stored, she
snatched from beneath them a billet of wood and flung it on the fire
that was burning on the hearth.

Strange treasure to be laid up among gold and silver and needlework--a
billet of fir-wood about the size of a child's body, black with age and
charred, as though it had been already in the fire!

The merry flames leapt up and kissed the black brand, which lay for a
few minutes dull and still among them; but the fire was bright and
strong, and soon the outer bark cracked and glowed, and then the whole
mass grew ruddy like a bar of iron in a smith's forge, and the jocund
flames leapt higher, with many a fountain of sparks; then the billet
began to whiten and to smoulder, and flakes of grey ash dropped off, and
it grew smaller and smaller, passing away in light atoms; and all the
while the Queen Althaea stood gazing at it, her white face set like a
flint and her tremulous hands clasped tight together; for well she knew
what the burning of that firebrand meant--well

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

she remembered that when her little Meleager was newly laid in her
bosom, and the mother's joy was fresh in her heart, there came floating
into her chamber three weird women. The nurse who sat by the hearth
thought it was but a wreath of smoke blown by the wind across the
chamber, but Althaea knew them to be the dread Moirae, the sisters who
order the lives of men. They hung about the bed while one might count a
score, waving with their hands in mystic gestures over the new-born
child; then she who seemed the oldest snatched a firebrand from the
hearth, and flinging it into the flames, exclaimed--

"Brave and lovely shall the child be, and as long as yon firebrand
remains unconsumed, so long shall be his life upon earth"

The Moirae vanished, and Althaea leapt from her bed and snatching the
burning brand from the hearth quenched the flame and hid it beneath her
pillows, and had ever kept it as her chiefest treasure and as the
safeguard of Meleager's life.

What sound is yon of slowly-tramping feet, of stifled sobs--what burden
are these stout men of Kalydon and these guest-friends bearing into the
great hall of Oeneus? Althaea turned to look. What shrunken form is yon,
with yellow locks hanging and feeble hands dragging on the ground? Can
this be her Meleager, the pride of Aetolia, her bright-haired son? A
shriek that pierced to the halls of the Olympians rang through the
palace; it was he, and her hand had slain him.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Alas, alas! what were fifty brothers to one such
son? In vain she plunged her hands into the flames to grasp what yet
remained of the brand, the white ashes crumbled at her touch, and with a
groan, like that of a parting spirit, she rushed to hide her horror in
darkness and in solitude.

So perished the noble Meleager, fordone by the rash act of his mother,
and the gallant troop of hunters who had gathered so lightly at the call
of Oeneus broke up silently and sadly when the funeral rites were ended
and the lofty barrow piled; and most solitary, most sad, went Atalanta,
she who had been the innocent cause of Meleager's death. But the fame of
her beauty and her matchless skill was spread abroad through all the
Achaean land, by the heroes who had seen her in Kalydon; and Iasius, her
father, who was now growing into years, and had no child, neither son
nor daughter, save the little maid who had been laid in the cave of
Mount Parthenius, became ten times more anxious to recover her than he
had been to destroy her feeble life, and learning from the shepherds the
wondrous tale of her preservation by the she-bear, and of her life
afterwards, he sent with much ado to fetch her from the hill-side where
she was wont to dwell, and besought her to come home to his palace, to
live with him as his beloved daughter, and when he should die to rule
the Arkadians after him.

But Atalanta would not hearken to the messengers.

"If Iasius be indeed my father," she said, "I owe

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

him no filial duty; when I needed care and tenderness he spurned me from
his hearth; now that he has no longer hope of a son, and that Artemis
hath made me famous, he would have me home. Tell him, that the home he
decreed for me, when an infant, pleases me better now than palace of
bronze or roof of cedar-wood."

Then Iasius came himself and entreated her, and the heart of Atalanta
smote her at the sight of his white hair and his tearful eyes; it was
not right, she felt, for a father to be a suppliant to his own daughter;
so she went, sorely against her will, from the woodland to dwell in the
city, and learn the manners and the ways of men. When it was known that
King Iasius had a fair daughter dwelling in his palace, who should
inherit his wealth and all his lands, and who besides was the famous
huntress Atalanta, wooers, many and noble, from all parts of the Achaean
land came to seek her in marriage; but Atalanta remembered the lessons
of Orythieia, that she who is beloved by Artemis must have nothing to do
with love and marriage, and Iasius, though he was proud to see so many
noble chieftains hanging about his palace gates, was by no means
disposed to let his daughter go; but because she was wondrously swift,
and he loved to see her run, he caused a proclamation to be made, that
Atalanta should become the wife of him who should outstrip her in the
race, but that if she should outrun him he should yield himself
vanquished, and should perish

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

beneath the axe. To many this proclamation seemed too haughty, but there
were not wanting youths who thought the maiden worth the seeking even at
this price, and Atalanta came to dread the sound of the herald's
trumpet, which proclaimed the coming of a new suitor, from whose
presence she could only be delivered by the alternative of his death.

On a summer day there came to Atalanta the tidings that a fresh suitor
had presented himself, and the warning to hold herself in readiness to
run at the appointed hour. It was a slim, fair-haired youth, swift
enough among his comrades, but who had no chance with the wind-footed
Atalanta; but when he was led away to his death, there stood forward one
who had borne him company, who looking Iasius straight in the eyes,
spoke as follows:

"I also, King Iasius, claim the right to run in the race with the
Princess Atalanta. I am called Meilanion, the son of Amphidamas, and my
father owns hills and valleys near to thine."

"I know the noble Amphidamas well," said Iasius, eyeing the stranger
keenly; "he and I are guest-friends. Come thou home with me to my palace
and taste of the banquet and of the brimming goblet; it were better
thus, than that thou shouldst risk thy life in running with Atalanta."

"Nay, not so, O king. When I came hither, I confess that I thought thy
proclamation harsh and unworthy of a free-born Achaean king, but now
that I have beheld

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

the noble Atalanta, and seen her run, so help me Zeus! I think the
condition good, for indeed no one who cannot surpass her in the
foot-race, is worthy to be her yokefellow, and he who has failed, having
aimed at so great honour, is to be envied if he at once enter the house
of Hades, for what other mortal maid could he brook to wed, having once
beheld her matchless form?"

"Nevertheless, death is bitter, especially to a young man," said Iasius,
pityingly. The princess said nothing, but she looked at the comely
youth, and a sorrow filled her soul such as she had not felt for anyone
of the chieftains who had died for her sake--such a sorrow as darkened
her soul when Meleager lay dying beside the slain boar, for this was a
youth bright-eyed and beautiful, broad-chested and narrow-flanked,
looking as Phoebus looks when he stands in the glory of the morning on
the hills of Lycia.

"Father," she said softly to Iasius, "send him away!"

"I would willingly indeed send him away, Atalanta, seeing it is
impossible for any mortal man to contend with thee in swiftness of foot;
but if he persists I cannot refuse him his chance." Then he turned once
more to the stranger. "Know," he said, kindly, "that this maiden has
been trained to swiftness from her infancy; a she-bear was her
nursing-mother, the mountain nymphs who attend on Artemis, the tamer of
wild beasts, were her trainers; not Boreas himself

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

rushes more swiftly when he tips the crests of the waves with foam. Be
advised, retire from the contest while thou art still unconquered!"

But Meilanion would not hearken; the look of pity in Atalanta's eyes
kindled the longing more sharply in his heart, he was well content to
win her or to die, and he would gladly have run the race at once; but
this Iasius would not permit, for the day was far spent and both
Atalanta and her wooer stood in need of food and rest. So they went home
to the palace and partook of the well-appointed banquet, and of the
sweet wine, seasoning the food with much pleasant talk of men and
places, and listening to the long-haired Thamyris, [6](lgh14.htm#xref_6.md)
who was sojourning at the court of Iasius, a sweet minstrel truly, but
not yet so famous or so proud of his skill as to challenge the Muses,
daughters of aegis-bearing Jove!

When at length the feast was over, and Iasius and all his court were
wrapt in sleep, the stranger felt no touch of weariness, all his soul
was filled with the image of the princess, and kneeling, he prayed this
prayer to golden Aphrodite.

"O, thou irresistible daughter of highest Jove, who hast imbued the
maiden Atalanta with a share of thine own loveliness, desert me not in
this my strait: Yea, verily, I pray thee desert us not, for I think
that, thanks to thee, the maiden herself would not be ill-pleased to be
conquered in this race if only Artemis, rejoicing in the bow, were not
displeased! Hearken to me, golden Aphrodite, if ever I have hung thy
shrine with garlands;

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

so shall frankincense burn for ever at thy shrine, and garlands of
fragrant flowers be daily hung about thine altars!"

And Aphrodite heard him where she sat beside the Trojan Anchises in a
glade of Ida, and she laughed to think that Atalanta, the sworn
attendant of her shrewish sister Artemis, had at length yielded to the
arrows of her playful son; so she poured sweet sleep upon Meilanion, and
in his sleep she showed herself to him in the form of Arené, his own
mother, and bade him be of good cheer, and she gave him three golden
apples from the gardens of the Hesperides, bidding him throw them in the
path of the maiden as she ran, who, trusting to her swiftness, would
stop to pick them up, and so be easily vanquished. And it came to pass
even as the goddess prophesied. Atalanta, beholding the beautiful golden
fruit--such fruit as mortal eye had never before looked on--could not
restrain herself, and while she stooped to pick them up, Meilanion
darted on ahead, and won an easy victory. Thus Atalanta was at last
vanquished, and became the wife of Meilanion, son of Amphidamas, and
dwelt in the sweet Arkadian land, content to be a wife and mother, and
to care for housewifery; but one son was given to her, whom his father
called Parthenopaeus, a noble youth, who grew to man's estate only to
perish with Polynices, the son of the unhappy Oedipus, when the flower
of the Achaean chivalry died beneath the fatal walls of Thebes.

When the tidings of the death of her son came to

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Atalanta, a mighty longing for the woods and
water-brooks took possession of her soul, and an unconquerable weariness
of the ways of men and all the restraints of court life; and she
persuaded Meilanion to leave the cities and the haunts of men, and to go
out with her alone into the wild woodland, where they could live in
unrestrained freedom like the wild creatures that people it. Wherefore
the poets have feigned that the gods changed them both into bears, which
ever haunt the mountain glades and shun the paths of men.
