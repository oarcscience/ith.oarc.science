### V

The principal thrust of appellant's attack on the Texas statutes is that
they improperly invade a right, said to be possessed by the pregnant
woman, to choose to terminate her pregnancy. Appellant would discover
this right in the concept of personal "liberty" embodied in the
Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause; or in personal, marital,
familial, and sexual privacy said to be protected by the Bill of Rights
or its penumbras, see Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965);
Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972); id., at 460 (WHITE, J.,
concurring in result); or among those rights reserved to the people by
the Ninth Amendment, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S., at 486
(Goldberg, J., concurring). Before addressing this claim, we feel it
desirable briefly to survey, in several aspects, the history of
abortion, for such insight as that history may afford us, and then to
examine the state purposes and interests behind the criminal abortion
laws.
