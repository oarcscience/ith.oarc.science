### VII

Three reasons have been advanced to explain historically the enactment
of criminal abortion laws in the 19th century and to justify their
continued existence. \[410 U.S. 113, 148\]

It has been argued occasionally that these laws were the product of a
Victorian social concern to discourage illicit sexual conduct. Texas,
however, does not advance this justification in the present case, and it
appears that no court or commentator has taken the argument
seriously. [42](rvw13.htm#xref_42.md) The appellants and amici contend,
moreover, that this is not a proper state purpose at all and suggest
that, if it were, the Texas statutes are overbroad in protecting it
since the law fails to distinguish between married and unwed mothers.

A second reason is concerned with abortion as a medical procedure. When
most criminal abortion laws were first enacted, the procedure was a
hazardous one for the woman. [43](rvw13.htm#xref_43.md) This was
particularly true prior to the \[410 U.S. 113, 149\] development of
antisepsis. Antiseptic techniques, of course, were based on discoveries
by Lister, Pasteur, and others first announced in 1867, but were not
generally accepted and employed until about the turn of the century.
Abortion mortality was high. Even after 1900, and perhaps until as late
as the development of antibiotics in the 1940's, standard modern
techniques such as dilation and curettage were not nearly so safe as
they are today. Thus, it has been argued that a State's real concern in
enacting a criminal abortion law was to protect the pregnant woman, that
is, to restrain her from submitting to a procedure that placed her life
in serious jeopardy.

Modern medical techniques have altered this situation. Appellants and
various amici refer to medical data indicating that abortion in early
pregnancy, that is, prior to the end of the first trimester, although
not without its risk, is now relatively safe. Mortality rates for women
undergoing early abortions, where the procedure is legal, appear to be
as low as or lower than the rates for normal
childbirth. [44](rvw13.htm#xref_44.md) Consequently, any interest of the
State in protecting the woman from an inherently hazardous procedure,
except when it would be equally dangerous for her to forgo it, has
largely disappeared. Of course, important state interests in the areas
of health and medical standards do remain. \[410 U.S. 113, 150\] The
State has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, like any
other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure
maximum safety for the patient. This interest obviously extends at least
to the performing physician and his staff, to the facilities involved,
to the availability of after-care, and to adequate provision for any
complication or emergency that might arise. The prevalence of high
mortality rates at illegal "abortion mills" strengthens, rather than
weakens, the State's interest in regulating the conditions under which
abortions are performed. Moreover, the risk to the woman increases as
her pregnancy continues. Thus, the State retains a definite interest in
protecting the woman's own health and safety when an abortion is
proposed at a late stage of pregnancy.

The third reason is the State's interest-some phrase it in terms of
duty-in protecting prenatal life. Some of the argument for this
justification rests on the theory that a new human life is present from
the moment of conception. [45](rvw13.htm#xref_45.md) The State's interest
and general obligation to protect life then extends, it is argued, to
prenatal life. Only when the life of the pregnant mother herself is at
stake, balanced against the life she carries within her, should the
interest of the embryo or fetus not prevail. Logically, of course, a
legitimate state interest in this area need not stand or fall on
acceptance of the belief that life begins at conception or at some other
point prior to live birth. In assessing the State's interest,
recognition may be given to the less rigid claim that as long as at
least potential life is involved, the State may assert interests beyond
the protection of the pregnant woman alone. \[410 U.S. 113, 151\]

Parties challenging state abortion laws have sharply disputed in some
courts the contention that a purpose of these laws, when enacted, was to
protect prenatal life. [46](rvw13.htm#xref_46.md) Pointing to the absence
of legislative history to support the contention, they claim that most
state laws were designed solely to protect the woman. Because medical
advances have lessened this concern, at least with respect to abortion
in early pregnancy, they argue that with respect to such abortions the
laws can no longer be justified by any state interest. There is some
scholarly support for this view of original
purpose. [47](rvw13.htm#xref_47.md) The few state courts called upon to
interpret their laws in the late 19th and early 20th centuries did focus
on the State's interest in protecting the woman's health rather than in
preserving the embryo and fetus. [48](rvw13.htm#xref_48.md) Proponents of
this view point out that in many States, including
Texas, [49](rvw13.htm#xref_49.md) by statute or judicial interpretation,
the pregnant woman herself could not be prosecuted for self-abortion or
for cooperating in an abortion performed upon her by
another. [50](rvw13.htm#xref_50.md) They claim that adoption of the
"quickening" distinction through received common \[410 U.S. 113, 152\]
law and state statutes tacitly recognizes the greater health hazards
inherent in late abortion and impliedly repudiates the theory that life
begins at conception.

It is with these interests, and the weight to be attached to them, that
this case is concerned.
