<span id="xref_1">1</span> "Article 1191. Abortion

"If any person shall designedly administer to a pregnant woman or
knowingly procure to be administered with her consent any drug or
medicine, or shall use towards her any violence or means whatever
externally or internally applied, and thereby procure an abortion, he
shall be confined in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than
five years; if it be done without her consent, the punishment shall be
doubled. By \`abortion' is meant that the life of the fetus or embryo
shall be destroyed in the woman's womb or that a premature birth thereof
be caused.

"Art. 1192. Furnishing the means

"Whoever furnishes the means for procuring an abortion knowing the
purpose intended is guilty as an accomplice.

"Art. 1193. Attempt at abortion

"If the means used shall fail to produce an abortion, the offender is
nevertheless guilty of an attempt to produce abortion, provided \[410
U.S. 113, 118\] it be shown that such means were calculated to produce
that result, and shall be fined not less than one hundred nor more than
one thousand dollars.

"Art. 1194. Murder in producing abortion

"If the death of the mother is occasioned by an abortion so produced or
by an attempt to effect the same it is murder."

"Art. 1196. By medical advice

"Nothing in this chapter applies to an abortion procured or attempted by
medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother."

The foregoing Articles, together with Art. 1195, compose Chapter 9 of
Title 15 of the Penal Code. Article 1195, not attacked here, reads:

"Art. 1195. Destroying unborn child

"Whoever shall during parturition of the mother destroy the vitality or
life in a child in a state of being born and before actual birth, which
child would otherwise have been born alive, shall be confined in the
penitentiary for life or for not less than five years."

<span id="xref_3">3</span> Long ago, a suggestion was made that the
Texas statutes were unconstitutionally vague because of definitional
deficiencies. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals disposed of that
suggestion peremptorily, saying only,

"It is also insisted in the motion in arrest of judgment that the
statute is unconstitutional and void in that it does not sufficiently
define or describe the offense of abortion. We do not concur in respect
to this question." Jackson v. State, 55 Tex. Cr. R. 79, 89, 115 S. W.
262, 268 (1908).

The same court recently has held again that the State's abortion
statutes are not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Thompson v.
State (Ct. Crim. App. Tex. 1971), appeal docketed, No. 71-1200. The
court held that "the State of Texas has a compelling interest to protect
fetal life"; that Art. 1191 "is designed to protect fetal life"; that
the Texas homicide statutes, particularly Art. 1205 of the Penal Code,
are intended to protect a person "in existence by actual birth" and
thereby implicitly recognize other human life that is not "in existence
by actual birth"; that the definition of human life is for the
legislature and not the courts; that Art. 1196 "is more definite than
the District of Columbia statute upheld in \[United States v.\] Vuitch"
( 402 U.S. 62 ); and that the Texas statute "is \[410 U.S. 113, 120\]
not vague and indefinite or overbroad." A physician's abortion
conviction was affirmed.

In Thompson, n. 2, the court observed that any issue as to the burden of
proof under the exemption of Art. 1196 "is not before us." But see
Veevers v. State, 172 Tex. Cr. R. 162, 168-169, 354 S. W. 2d 161,
166-167 (1962). Cf. United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. 62, 69-71 (1971).

<span id="xref_6">6</span> The appellee twice states in his brief that
the hearing before the District Court was held on July 22, 1970. Brief
for Appellee 13. The docket entries, App. 2, and the transcript, App.
76, reveal this to be an error. The July date appears to be the time of
the reporter's transcription. See App. 77.

<span id="xref_7">7</span> We need not consider what different result,
if any, would follow if Dr. Hallford's intervention were on behalf of a
class. His complaint in intervention does not purport to assert a class
suit and makes no reference to any class apart from an allegation that
he "and others similarly situated" must necessarily guess at the meaning
of Art. 1196. His application for leave to intervene goes somewhat
further, for it asserts that plaintiff Roe does not adequately protect
the interest of the doctor "and the class of people who are physicians .
. . \[and\] the class of people who are . . . patients . . . ." The
leave application, however, is not the complaint. Despite the District
Court's statement to the contrary, 314 F. Supp., at 1225, we fail to
perceive the essentials of a class suit in the Hallford complaint.

<span id="xref_22">22</span> Early philosophers believed that the embryo
or fetus did not become formed and begin to live until at least 40 days
after conception for a male, and 80 to 90 days for a female. See, for
example, Aristotle, Hist. Anim. 7.3.583b; Gen. Anim. 2.3.736, 2.5.741;
Hippocrates, Lib. de Nat. Puer., No. 10. Aristotle's thinking derived
from his three-stage theory of life: vegetable, animal, rational. The
vegetable stage was reached at conception, the animal at "animation,"
and the rational soon after live birth. This theory, together with the
40/80 day view, came to be accepted by early Christian thinkers.

The theological debate was reflected in the writings of St. Augustine,
who made a distinction between embryo inanimatus, not yet endowed with a
soul, and embryo animatus. He may have drawn upon Exodus 21:22. At one
point, however, he expressed the view that human powers cannot determine
the point during fetal development at which the critical change occurs.
See Augustine, De Origine Animae 4.4 (Pub. Law 44.527). See also W.
Reany, The Creation of the Human Soul, c. 2 and 83-86 (1932); Huser, The
Crime of Abortion in Canon Law 15 (Catholic Univ. of America, Canon Law
Studies No. 162, Washington, D.C., 1942).

Galen, in three treatises related to embryology, accepted the thinking
of Aristotle and his followers. Quay 426-427. Later, Augustine on
abortion was incorporated by Gratian into the Decretum, published about
1140. Decretum Magistri Gratiani 2.32.2.7 to 2.32.2.10, \[410 U.S. 113,
134\] in 1 Corpus Juris Canonici 1122, 1123 (A. Friedburg, 2d ed. 1879).
This Decretal and the Decretals that followed were recognized as the
definitive body of canon law until the new Code of 1917.

For discussions of the canon-law treatment, see Means I, pp. 411-412;
Noonan 20-26; Quay 426-430; see also J. Noonan, Contraception: A History
of Its Treatment by the Catholic Theologians and Canonists 18-29 (1965).

<span id="xref_23">23</span> Bracton took the position that abortion by
blow or poison was homicide "if the foetus be already formed and
animated, and particularly if it be animated." 2 H. Bracton, De Legibus
et Consuetudinibus Angliae 279 (T. Twiss ed. 1879), or, as a later
translation puts it, "if the foetus is already formed or quickened,
especially if it is quickened," 2 H. Bracton, On the Laws and Customs of
England 341 (S. Thorne ed. 1968). See Quay 431; see also 2 Fleta 60-61

Is a Penumbral or Ninth-Amendment Right About to Arise from the
Nineteenth-Century Legislative Ashes of a Fourteenth-Century Common-Law
Liberty?, 17 N. Y. L. F. 335 (1971) (hereinafter Means II). The author
examines the two principal precedents cited marginally by Coke, both
contrary to his dictum, and traces the treatment of these and other
cases by earlier commentators. He concludes that Coke, who himself
participated as an advocate in an abortion case in 1601, may have
intentionally misstated the law. The author even suggests a reason:
Coke's strong feelings against abortion, coupled with his determination
to assert common-law (secular) jurisdiction to assess penalties for an
offense that traditionally had been an exclusively ecclesiastical or
canon-law crime. See also Lader 78-79, who notes that some scholars
doubt that the common law ever was applied to abortion; that the English
ecclesiastical courts seem to have lost interest in the problem after
1527; and that the preamble to the English legislation of 1803, 43 Geo.
3, c. 58, 1, referred to in the text, infra, at 136, states that "no
adequate means have been hitherto provided for the prevention and
punishment of such offenses."

By the end of 1970, four other States had repealed criminal penalties
for abortions performed in early pregnancy by a licensed physician,
subject to stated procedural and health requirements. Alaska Stat.

125.05, subd. 3 (Supp. 1972-1973); Wash. Rev. Code 9.02.060 to 9.02.080
(Supp. 1972). The precise status of criminal abortion laws in some
States is made unclear by recent decisions in state and federal courts
striking down existing state laws, in whole or in part.

<span id="xref_38">38</span> "Whereas, Abortion, like any other medical
procedure, should not be performed when contrary to the best interests
of the patient \[410 U.S. 113, 144\] since good medical practice
requires due consideration for the patient's welfare and not mere
acquiescence to the patient's demand; and

"Whereas, The standards of sound clinical judgment, which, together with
informed patient consent should be determinative according to the merits
of each individual case; therefore be it

"RESOLVED, That abortion is a medical procedure and should be performed
only by a duly licensed physician and surgeon in an accredited hospital
acting only after consultation with two other physicians chosen because
of their professional competency and in conformance with standards of
good medical practice and the Medical Practice Act of his State; and be
it further

"RESOLVED, That no physician or other professional personnel shall be
compelled to perform any act which violates his good medical judgment.
Neither physician, hospital, nor hospital personnel shall be required to
perform any act violative of personally-held moral principles. In these
circumstances good medical practice requires only that the physician or
other professional personnel withdraw from the case so long as the
withdrawal is consistent with good medical practice." Proceedings of the
AMA House of Delegates 220 (June 1970).

<span id="xref_39">39</span> "The Principles of Medical Ethics of the
AMA do not prohibit a physician from performing an abortion that is
performed in accordance with good medical practice and under
circumstances that do not violate the laws of the community in which he
practices.

"In the matter of abortions, as of any other medical procedure, the
Judicial Council becomes involved whenever there is alleged violation of
the Principles of Medical Ethics as established by the House of
Delegates."

<span id="xref_40">40</span> "UNIFORM ABORTION ACT

"SECTION 1. \[Abortion Defined; When Authorized.\]

"(a) \`Abortion' means the termination of human pregnancy with an
intention other than to produce a live birth or to remove a dead fetus.

"(b) An abortion may be performed in this state only if it is performed:

"(1) by a physician licensed to practice medicine \[or osteopathy\] in
this state or by a physician practicing medicine \[or osteopathy\] in
the employ of the government of the United States or of this state,
\[and the abortion is performed \[in the physician's office or in a
medical clinic, or\] in a hospital approved by the \[Department of
Health\] or operated by the United States, this state, or any
department, agency, or political subdivision of either;\] or by a female
upon herself upon the advice of the physician; and

"(2) within 20. weeks after the commencement of the pregnancy \[or after
20. weeks only if the physician has reasonable cause to believe (i)
there is a substantial risk that continuance of the pregnancy would
endanger the life of the mother or would gravely impair the physical or
mental health of the mother, (ii) that the child would be born with
grave physical or mental defect, or (iii) that \[410 U.S. 113, 147\] the
pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, or illicit intercourse with a
girl under the age of 16 years\].

"SECTION 2. \[Penalty.\] Any person who performs or procures an abortion
other than authorized by this Act is guilty of a \[felony\] and, upon
conviction thereof, may be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding
\[$1,000\] or to imprisonment \[in the state penitentiary\] not
exceeding \[5 years\], or both.

"SECTION 3. \[Uniformity of Interpretation.\] This Act shall be
construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with
respect to the subject of this Act among those states which enact it.

"SECTION 4. \[Short Title.\] This Act may be cited as the Uniform
Abortion Act.

"SECTION 5. \[Severability.\] If any provision of this Act or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this Act
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application,
and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable.

"SECTION 6. \[Repeal.\] The following acts and parts of acts are
repealed: "(1) "(2) "(3)

"SECTION 7. \[Time of Taking Effect.\] This Act shall take effect
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."

<span id="xref_41">41</span> "This Act is based largely upon the New
York abortion act following a review of the more recent laws on abortion
in several states and upon recognition of a more liberal trend in laws
on this subject. Recognition was given also to the several decisions in
state and federal courts which show a further trend toward
liberalization of abortion laws, especially during the first trimester
of pregnancy.

"Recognizing that a number of problems appeared in New York, a shorter
time period for \`unlimited' abortions was advisable. The \[410 U.S.
113, 148\] time period was bracketed to permit the various states to
insert a figure more in keeping with the different conditions that might
exist among the states. Likewise, the language limiting the place or
places in which abortions may be performed was also bracketed to account
for different conditions among the states. In addition, limitations on
abortions after the initial \`unlimited' period were placed in brackets
so that individual states may adopt all or any of these reasons, or
place further restrictions upon abortions after the initial period.

"This Act does not contain any provision relating to medical review
committees or prohibitions against sanctions imposed upon medical
personnel refusing to participate in abortions because of religious or
other similar reasons, or the like. Such provisions, while related, do
not directly pertain to when, where, or by whom abortions may be
performed; however, the Act is not drafted to exclude such a provision
by a state wishing to enact the same."

<span id="xref_53">53</span> We are not aware that in the taking of any
census under this clause, a fetus has ever been counted.

<span id="xref_54">54</span> When Texas urges that a fetus is entitled
to Fourteenth Amendment protection as a person, it faces a dilemma.
Neither in Texas nor in any other State are all abortions prohibited.
Despite broad proscription, an exception always exists. The exception
contained \[410 U.S. 113, 158\] in Art. 1196, for an abortion procured
or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the
mother, is typical. But if the fetus is a person who is not to be
deprived of life without due process of law, and if the mother's
condition is the sole determinant, does not the Texas exception appear
to be out of line with the Amendment's command?

There are other inconsistencies between Fourteenth Amendment status and
the typical abortion statute. It has already been pointed out, n. 49,
supra, that in Texas the woman is not a principal or an accomplice with
respect to an abortion upon her. If the fetus is a person, why is the
woman not a principal or an accomplice? Further, the penalty for
criminal abortion specified by Art. 1195 is significantly less than the
maximum penalty for murder prescribed by Art. 1257 of the Texas Penal
Code. If the fetus is a person, may the penalties be different?

<span id="xref_55">55</span> Cf. the Wisconsin abortion statute,
defining "unborn child" to mean "a human being from the time of
conception until it is born alive," Wis. Stat. 940.04 (6) (1969), and
the new Connecticut Statute, Pub. Act No. 1 (May 1972 special session),
declaring it to be the public policy of the State and the legislative
intent "to protect and preserve human life from the moment of
conception."

<span id="xref_67">67</span> Neither in this opinion nor in Doe v.
Bolton, post, p. 179, do we discuss the father's rights, if any exist in
the constitutional context, in the abortion decision. No paternal right
has been asserted in either of the cases, and the Texas and the Georgia
statutes on their face take no cognizance of the father. We are aware
that some statutes recognize the father under certain circumstances.
North Carolina, for example, N.C. Gen. Stat. 14-45.1 (Supp. 1971),
requires written permission for the abortion from the husband when the
woman is a married minor, that is, when she is less than 18 years of
age, 41 N.C. A. G. 489 (1971); if the woman is an unmarried minor,
written permission from the parents is required. We need not now decide
whether provisions of this kind are constitutional.
