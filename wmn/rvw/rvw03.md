### III

It might have been preferable if the defendant, pursuant to our Rule 20,
had presented to us a petition for certiorari before judgment in the
Court of Appeals with respect to the granting of the plaintiffs' prayer
for declaratory relief. Our decisions in Mitchell v. Donovan, 398 U.S.
427 (1970), and Gunn v. University Committee, 399 U.S. 383 (1970), are
to the effect that 1253 does not authorize an appeal to this Court from
the grant or denial of declaratory relief alone. We conclude,
nevertheless, that those decisions do not foreclose our review of both
the injunctive and the declaratory aspects of a case of this kind when
it is properly here, as this one is, on appeal under 1253 from specific
denial of injunctive relief, and the arguments as to both aspects are
necessarily identical. See Carter v. Jury Comm'n, 396 U.S. 320 (1970);
Florida Lime Growers v. Jacobsen, 362 U.S. 73, 80-81 (1960). It would be
destructive of time and energy for all concerned were we to rule
otherwise. Cf. Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 179.
