### I

The Texas statutes that concern us here are Arts. 1191-1194 and 1196 of
the State's Penal Code. [1](rvw13.htm#xref_1.md) These make it a crime to
"procure an abortion," as therein \[410 U.S. 113, 118\] defined, or to
attempt one, except with respect to "an abortion procured or attempted
by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother."
Similar statutes are in existence in a majority of the
States. [2](rvw13.htm#xref_2.md) \[410 U.S. 113, 119\]

Texas first enacted a criminal abortion statute in 1854. Texas Laws
1854, c. 49, 1, set forth in  [3](rvw13.htm#xref_3.md) H. Gammel, Laws of
Texas 1502 (1898). This was soon modified into language that has
remained substantially unchanged to the present time. See Texas Penal
Code of 1857, c. 7, Arts. 531-536; G. Paschal, Laws of Texas, Arts.
2192-2197 (1866); Texas Rev. Stat., c. 8, Arts. 536-541 (1879); Texas
Rev. Crim. Stat., Arts. 1071-1076 (1911). The final article in each of
these compilations provided the same exception, as does the present
Article 1196, for an abortion by "medical advice for the purpose of
saving the life of the mother."  [3](rvw13.htm#xref_3.md) \[410 U.S. 113,
120\]
