# ERIS

### I.

Sing now, my muse, of the Goddess of Chaos,  
Arising from primeval Quantum foam born,  
Goddess of Entropy, Goddess of Anarchy,  
She who creates and destroys innumerable cosmos  
In the gap between dawn and the rise of the sun,  
She who dances between unseen fractal dimensions,  
In a small still place all enfolded in storm,  
Where tempests so huge, lighting rends open the quasars,  
So massive no light escapes from her shroud,  
She who sunders our soul from our sweet earthly flesh,  
And brings us rebirth with her ghastly sweet breath,  
Lover of Death and Lover of Life,  
She dances a dance on the edge of a knife,  
A gulf of ten thousand light years on each side,  
And She never misses one step in the dark,  
Singularity bound, in a teardrop of light,  
Cocooned in the smallest, suffused in the largest,  
Immortal Chaos wreathed with broken planets and dust,  
Thy name is Eris, world shattering Goddess,  
We ride your wave breathless and are towed under again.  
Singularity Goddess, you approach inverse zero,  
Still more drowned worlds loom in Thy billowing shroud.  
Asleep and awake she dreams our creation,  
The sound of a bell in an dark empty cavern,  
The scent of a rose in a room long abandoned,  
The dance of the motes in the eye of the Goddess,  
The touch of a breeze in the heat of the noon,  
The taste of wine from an ancient tomb offering  
She is there always, and not there ever,  
Look and you will miss her,  
Close your eyes and she is before you.  
Most terrible and most beautiful name of the Goddess, Eris!
