# Commentary

This section of the Book of the Goddess has commentary on the principles
of the Goddess, and correspondences between the principles and each of
the nine key names of the Goddess.

This section also gives Invocations for each of the key Goddesses. A
Invocation is a short passage which should be recited inwardly. Some of
these Invocations are identified with a particular time of day or
activity. Others are suggested for use in particular situations where
the influence of the Goddess may be required. These can also be recited
aloud, alone, with another person, or in a group, as desired. Thus the
pronouns 'I/me' and 'we/us' are interchangeable in these Invocation, as
required by context.
