### V.

I believe, O Goddess of all Goddesses,  
That Thou art the eternal Mother of life;  
I believe, O Goddess of all Goddesses,  
That Thou art the eternal Mother of love.  
I believe, O Goddess of all Goddesses,  
That Thou art the eternal Mother of the avatars;  
I believe, O Goddess of all Goddesses,  
That Thou art the eternal Mother of each one.  
I believe, O Goddess of all Goddesses,  
That Thou art the eternal Mother of all beings;  
I believe, O Goddess of all Goddesses,  
That Thou art the eternal Mother of the Universe.  
I believe, O Goddess of the Universe,  
That Thou art the creator of the high heavens,  
That Thou art the creator of the skies above,  
That Thou art the creator of the oceans below.  
I believe, O Goddess of the Universe,  
That Thou art She Who created my soul and set its warp,  
Who created my body from dust and from ashes,  
Who gave to my body breath, and to my soul its possession.  
Mother, bless to me my body,  
Mother, bless to me my soul,  
Mother, bless to me my life,  
Mother, bless to me my belief.  
Mother eternal and Goddess of the Universe,  
Mother eternal and Creatrix of life,  
I believe that Thou didst sing thy song at the bringing of the light  
Mother eternal and Goddess of the Universe,  
Enwrap Thou my body and my soul beloved,  
Safeguard me this night in the sanctuary of Thy love,  
Shelter me this night in the shelter of the avatars.  
Thou hast brought me up from last night  
To the gracious light of this day,  
Great joy to provide for my soul,  
And to do excelling good to me.  
Thanks be to Thee, Oh great Goddess,  
For the many gifts Thou hast bestowed on me,  
Each day and night, each sea and land,  
Each weather fair, each calm, each wild.  
I am giving Thee worship with my whole life,  
I am giving Thee assent with my whole power,  
I am giving Thee praise with my whole tongue,  
I am giving Thee honor with my whole utterance.  
I am giving Thee reverence with my whole understanding,  
I am giving Thee offering with my whole thought,  
I am giving Thee praise with my whole fervor,  
I am giving Thee love with my whole devotion,  
I am giving Thee pleasure with my whole desire,  
I am giving Thee love with my whole heart,  
I am giving Thee affection with my whole sense;  
I am giving Thee my existence with my whole mind,  
I am giving Thee my soul, O Goddess of the Universe.  
My thought, my deed,  
My word, my will,  
My understanding, my intellect,  
My way, my state.  
I am beseeching Thee  
To keep me from ill,  
To keep me from hurt,  
To keep me from harm;  
To keep me from mischance,  
To keep me from grief,  
To keep me this night  
In the nearness of Thy love.  
May the Goddess shield me,  
May the Goddess fill me,  
May the Goddess keep me,  
May the Goddess watch me.  
May the Goddess bring me  
To the land of peace,  
To the grove of the Goddess,  
To the peace of eternity.  
Praise to the Nymph,  
Praise to the Mother,  
Praise to the Crone,  
The Three in One.
