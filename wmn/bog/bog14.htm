<p>Hail to the Earth mother, who caused the yellow flowers to blossom, who scattered the seeds of the cactus, as she came forth from Paradise.<br> Hail to the Earth mother, who poured forth flowers in abundance, who scattered the seeds of the cactus, as she came forth from Paradise.<br> Hail to the Earth mother, who caused the yellow flowers to blossom, she who scattered the seeds of the cactus, as she came forth from Paradise.<br> Hail to the Earth mother, who poured forth white flowers in abundance, who scattered the seeds of the cactus, as she came forth from Paradise.<br> Hail to the goddess who shines in the thorn bush like a bright butterfly.<br> Ho! she is our mother, goddess of the earth, she supplies food in the desert to the wild beasts, and causes them to live.<br> Thus, thus, you see her to be an ever-fresh model of liberality toward all flesh.<br> And as you see the goddess of the earth do to the wild beasts, so also does she toward the green herbs and the fishes.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">II.</h3>  
<p>This many are the days<br> Since our moon mother,<br> Yonder in the west<br> Appeared still small.<br> When she became fully grown<br> Seeking yonder along the river courses<br> The ones who are our mothers,<br> Female willow,<br> Four times cutting the straight young shoots,<br> To my house<br> I brought my road.<br> This day,<br> With my warm human hands<br> I took hold of them.<br> I gave my offerings human form.<br> With the striped cloud tail<br> Of the one who is my grandmother,<br> With the striped cloud wings<br> And massed cloud tails<br> Of all the birds of summer,<br> With these four times I gave my offerings human form.<br> With the flesh of the one who is my mother,<br> Cotton woman,<br> Even a poorly made cotton thread,<br> Four times encircling them and tying it about their bodies,<br> I gave the offerings human form<br> With the flesh of the one who is our mother,<br> Four times covering them with flesh,<br> I gave my offerings human form.<br> In a short time the offerings were ready.<br> Taking the offerings,<br> I made my road go forth.<br> Yonder with prayers<br> We took our road.<br> Thinking, "Let it be here,"<br> Our earth mother<br> We passed upon her road.<br> There on your earth mother,<br> There where you are waiting your offerings<br> We have passed you on your roads.<br> There where you are all gathered together in beauty<br> Now that you are to receive your offerings,<br> You are gathered together.<br> This day I give you offerings.<br> By means of your supernatural wisdom<br> You will clothe yourself with the offerings.<br> Wherever you abide permanently,<br> At the place of the first beginning,<br> Touching one another with your offerings,<br> You will bend down to talk together.<br> From where you abide permanently,<br> Your little wind-blown cloud,<br> Your thin wisps of cloud,<br> Your hanging stripes of cloud,<br> Your massed up clouds, replete with living waters,<br> You will send forth to stay with us.<br> They will come out standing on all sides.<br> With your fine rain caressing the earth,<br> With your weapons, the lightning,<br> With your rumbling thunder,<br> Your great crashes of thunder,<br> With your fine rain caressing the earth,<br> Your heavy rain caressing the earth,<br> With your great pile of waters here<br> With these You will pass us on our roads.<br> In order that you may come to us thus<br> I have given you offerings. My mothers,<br> When you have taken your offerings,<br> With your waters,<br> Your seeds,<br> Your riches,<br> Your power,<br> Your strong spirit,<br> Will all your good fortune whereof you are possessed,<br> Me you will bless.<br> This day, my mothers,<br> I have given you offerings.<br> The source of our water of life.<br> The source of our flesh,<br> Flesh of the white corn<br> I give to you.<br> Taking your offerings,<br> With your waters,<br> Your seeds,<br> Your riches,<br> Your long life,<br> Your old age,<br> With all your good fortune<br> You will bless us.<br> This is all.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">III.</h3>
