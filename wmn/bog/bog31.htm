<p>Most high, omnipotent, good Goddess,<br> Praise, glory and honor and benediction all, are Thine.<br> To Thee alone do they belong, most High,<br> And all beings join hands in the circle of Thy love.</p>  
<p>Praise be to Thee, my Goddess, with all Thy creatures,<br> Especially to my worshipful Sister Sun,<br> Which lights up the day, and through her dost Thou brightness give;<br> And beautiful is she and radiant with splendor great;<br> Of Thee, most High, the very image.</p>  
<p>Praised be my Goddess, for Sister Moon and for the stars,<br> In heaven Thou hast formed them clear and precious and fair.</p>  
<p>Praised be my Goddess for Sister Atmosphere<br> And for the rain and air and clouds and fair and every kind of weather,<br> By which Thou givest to Thy creatures nourishment.<br> Praised be my Goddess for Sister Water,<br> Which is greatly helpful and humble and precious and pure.</p>  
<p>Praised be my Goddess for Sister Fire,<br> By which Thou lightest up the dark.<br> And fair is she and Gay and mighty and strong.</p>  
<p>Praised be my Goddess for our sister, Mother Earth,<br> Which sustains and keeps us<br> And brings forth diverse fruits with grass and flowers bright.</p>  
<p>Praised be my Goddess for those who for Thy love forgive<br> And weakness bear and tribulation.<br> Blessed those who shall in peace endure,<br> For by Thee, most High, shall they be crowned.<br> Praised be my Goddess for our Sister Kali, the bodily death,<br> From which no being can flee.<br> Pity be on them who die unloved by the Goddess;<br> Blessed art those who find enlightenment in Thy most holy embrace,<br> For they will find the way home to Thy Summerland.</p>  
<p>Praise ye and bless ye O Goddess, and give Her thanks,<br> And let all beings enjoy the nectar of Her ecstasy.</p>
