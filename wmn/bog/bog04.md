# THE NAMES OF THE GODDESS

The Goddess is one and multiform;  
The Goddess has nine billion names;  
And more;  
Of her names only a few do we sing:

### I.

Blessed be to the Goddess of Chaos, Eris inchoate,  
First of all to emerge in the undifferentiated plenum  
The splendid dancer on the interface  
Of the macrocosm and the microcosm;  
The Creatrix of all fractal dimensions;

### II.

Blessed be the Sun, Amaterasu,  
Creatrix of all solar planets;  
She we greet at dawns' first breath;  
She we hail at noon;  
She we bid farewell at twilight;

### III.

Blessed be broad-breasted Earth, Gaia;  
The ever-bountiful planet of our birth;  
From her core of fire  
To the outer wisps of her Ionosphere;  
She has birthed all evolved life;  
She has suffered mass extinctions;  
She has rebirthed species time and time again;  
We shall not rest in our defense of her  
Against the depredations of the patriarchs.

### IV.

Blessed be Maria,  
The Goddess of the Ocean;  
Blue-mantled, foam crested;  
She brings rains to the dry lands;  
Her song is sung by the whales of the deep.  
She nurtured life in its infancy;  
As she watches over childbirth;

### V.

Blessed be Maria's sister, Selene, the silent;  
Our constant companion;  
Goddess of the lunar cycle of the womb.  
At the dark moon we watch for her expectantly;  
At the new moon we hail her joyously;  
At the full moon we make love and sing her praise;  
At the waning moon we mourn and meditate.

### VI.

Blessed be Aphrodite, Goddess of Love  
Who we know also as Aphrodite,  
Bringer of delights;  
Joy which knows no boundaries;  
Kindness which needs no recompense;  
Lead us from jealousy which keeps us ever-reborn  
And bestow on us the paradise of the Goddess  
On Earth as it is on Heaven.

### VII.

Blessed be Athena; Goddess of Wisdom;  
She who taught us in the dawn time;  
How to speak, create tools, use fire;  
To till the land and tend it wisely;  
We see far and go forth in her name.

### VIII.

Blessed be Demeter,  
Bringer of seasons and giver of good gifts,  
We eat of your divine foods:  
Grains, Fruits, Vegetables;  
We praise your bounty at every meal;  
You sustain our bodies and gladden our soul.

### IX.

Blessed be Kali,  
Goddess of the Underworld;  
Skull-wreathed, terrible Goddess  
Death, destroyer of Universes;  
She who sits at the gate of rebirth;  
She who weighs our heart in the scales;  
If it weighs less than a pomegranate seed;  
She will send you on to the summerland;  
If it is heavier, you will wander in the Bardos;  
To find rebirth and find love once more.
