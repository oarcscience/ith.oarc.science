# APHRODITE

### I.

I will sing of stately Aphrodite, gold-crowned and beautiful,  
Whose dominion is the realm of love and beauty.  
The moist breath of the western wind wafted  
Her over the waves of the loud-moaning sea in soft foam,  
And there the gold-filleted Graces welcomed her joyously.  
They clothed her with heavenly garments:  
On her head they put a fine, well-wrought crown of gold,  
And in her pierced ears they hung ornaments of amber and precious
gold,  
And adorned her with golden necklaces over her soft neck and snow-white
breasts,  
Jewels which the gold-filleted Graces wear themselves whenever they go  
To their Mothers' grove to join the lovely dances of the Devas.  
And when they had fully decked her, they brought her to the Devas,  
Who welcomed her when She saw her, taking Her by their hands.  
Each one of them prayed that she might lead her home to be her
girlfriend,  
So greatly were they amazed at the beauty of violet-crowned Aphrodite.  
Hail, sweetly-winning, coy-eyed Goddess of Love!

### II.

Shimmering-thronéd immortal Aphrodite,  
Daughter of the Creatrix, Enchantress, I implore thee,  
Spare me, O queen, this agony and anguish,  
Crush not my spirit  
Whenever before thou has hearkened to me--  
To my voice calling to thee in the distance,  
And heeding, thou hast come, leaving thy mother's  
Golden dominions,  
With chariot yoked to thy fleet-winged coursers,  
Fluttering swift pinions over earth's darkness,  
And bringing thee through the infinite, gliding  
Downwards from heaven,  
Then, soon they arrived and thou, blessed goddess,  
With divine countenance smiling, didst ask me  
What new woe had befallen me now and why,  
Thus I had called thee.  
What in my mad heart was my greatest desire,  
Who was it now that must feel my allurements,  
Who was the fair one that must be persuaded,  
Who wronged you?  
For if now she flees, quickly she shall follow  
And if she spurns gifts, soon shall she offer them  
Yea, if she knows not love, soon shall she feel it  
Even reluctant.  
Come then, I pray, grant me surcease from sorrow,  
Drive away care, I beseech thee, O goddess  
Fulfil for me what I yearn to accomplish,  
Be thou my ally.

### III.

When jealousy surges through thy heart  
Let not thy foolish tongue take part.  
With my two arms, I do not aspire to touch the sky.  
So, like a child after its mother, I flutter.

Now lust shakes my soul,  
A wind on the mountain overwhelming the oaks.  
I know not what to do: I have two minds.  
Face me, my dear one and unveil the grace in your eyes.  
And a sweet expression spreads over her fair face.

I love refinement and for me  
Love has the splendor and beauty of the morning star.  
I yearn and I seek.  
To you, fair maidens, my mind does not change.

### IV.

I will sing of stately Aphrodite,  
Goddess of Love, pan-erotic,  
Who stirs up sweet passion  
And subdues the tribes of mortal women  
And birds that fly in air  
And all the many creatures that the dry land rears,  
And all the sea: all these love the deeds of Aphrodite.  
Gold-crowned and beautiful,  
Whose dominion is the cities of all sea-set Califas.  
There the moist breath of the western wind  
Wafted her over the waves of the loud-moaning sea in soft foam,  
And there the gold-filleted surf-goddesses welcomed her joyously.  
They clothed her with heavenly garments:  
On her head they put a fine, well-wrought crown of gold,  
And in her pierced ears they hung ornaments of platinum  
And precious gold, and adorned her with golden necklaces  
Over her soft neck and snow-white breasts,  
Jewels which the gold-filleted surf-goddesses wear themselves  
Whenever they go to their mother's house  
To join the lovely dances of the Goddess.  
And when they had fully decked her,  
They brought her to the goddesses,  
Who welcomed her when they saw her,  
Giving her their hands.  
Each one of them prayed that she might lead her home,  
To share pleasure with her,  
So greatly were they amazed at the beauty of violet-crowned Aphrodite.  
Hail, sweetly-winning, coy-eyed goddess!

### V.

O Aphrodite!  
In honor of thee I will hold this feast,  
Feast and drain the goblet deep,  
We, will dance and wildly leap,  
And if thou grant the grace which I require,  
Then when the dance is wildest, all the lamps  
Shall be extinguished and we'll freely love!
