# KALI

### I.

O Goddess Kali, give me of Thy wisdom,  
O Goddess Kali, give me of Thy mercy,  
O Goddess Kali, give me of Thy fullness,  
And of Thy guidance in face of every strait.  
O Goddess Kali, give me of Thy holiness,  
O Goddess Kali, give me of Thy shielding,  
O Goddess Kali, give me of Thy surrounding,  
And of Thy peace in the knot of my death.  
Oh give me of Thy surrounding,  
And of Thy peace at the hour of my death!

### II.

Death with joy and with forgiveness,  
Death without horror or repulsion,  
Death without fear or shrinking.  
Dying the death of the avatars,  
The Healer of my soul by my side,  
The death of peace and tranquillity,  
And grant Thou me a good day of burial.  
The seven devas of the Holy Goddess  
Be shielding me, and be this night the night  
Till brightness and summer-tide shall come!

### III.

I am going home with thee  
I am going home with thee  
To thy home! to thy home!  
I am going home with thee  
To thy home of winter.  
I am going home with thee  
To thy home! to thy home!  
I am going home with thee  
To thy home of autumn, of spring and of summer.  
I am going home with thee,  
Thou child of my love,  
To thine eternal bed,  
To thy bodies perpetual sleep.  
I am going home with thee,  
Thou child of my love,  
To the dear Daughter of blessings,  
To Kali, Mother of grace.

### IV.

Thou goest home this night to thy home of winter,  
To thy home of autumn, of spring, and of summer;  
Thou goest home this night to thy perpetual home,  
To thine eternal bed, to thine eternal slumber.  
Sleep thou, sleep, and away with thy sorrow,  
Sleep thou, sleep, and away with thy sorrow,  
Sleep thou, sleep, and away with thy sorrow;  
Sleep, thou beloved, in the Rock of the fold.  
Sleep this night in the breast of thy Mother,  
Sleep, thou beloved, while she herself soothes thee;  
Sleep thou this night on Kali's arm,  
Sleep, thou beloved, while she herself kisses thee.  
The sleep of the seven lights be thine, beloved,  
The sleep of the seven joys be thine, beloved,  
The sleep of the seven slumbers be thine, beloved,  
The shade of death lies upon thy face, beloved,  
In nearness to Kali, farewell to thy pains,  
Kali stands before thee and peace is in Her mind.  
Sleep, O sleep in the calm of all calm,  
Sleep, O sleep in the guidance of guidance,  
Sleep, O sleep in the love of all loves;  
Sleep, O beloved, in the Goddess of life,  
Sleep, O beloved, in the Goddess of life!

### V.

Give us, O Kali, the needs of the body,  
Give us, O Kali, the needs of the soul;  
Give us, O Kali, the healing balsam of the body,  
Give us, O Kali, the healing balsam of the soul.  
Give us, O Kali, the joy of forgiveness,  
Wash Thou from us the pain of jealousy,  
Cleanse Thou from us the stain of karma.  
That reincarnation may cease  
And we may live forever in your summerland.  
O great Goddess, Who art on the throne,  
Weigh mine heart on your scales,  
Give to us, O Kali, strong love,  
And that beautiful crown of the Queen;  
Give us, O Kali, the home of salvation  
Within the beauteous gates of Thy kingdom.  
Give us hospitality in the brightness of peace.
