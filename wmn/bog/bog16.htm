<p>Athena, exceeding in strength, chariot-rider, golden-helmed,<br> Doughty in heart, shield-bearer,<br> Goddess of all cunning knowledge from fire to nanotechnology,<br> Harnessed in armor, strong of arm, unwearying,<br> Mighty with the spear, O defender of Goddess-votaries,<br> Daughter of War, upholder of Peace,<br> Pure virgin queen of mercy,<br> Mother of all victory,<br> Leader of righteous women,<br> Sceptred Queen of Matriarchs.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">II.</h3>  
<p>Athena, you whirl your blood-red sphere among the planets<br> In their nine-fold courses through the solar sphere<br> Wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above<br> The firmament of heaven; hear me, helper of women,<br> Giver of dauntless youth!</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">III.</h3>  
<p>I sing of Athena, Goddess of warriors,<br> Shed down a kindly ray from above upon my life,<br> And strength of war,<br> Dread is she, and loves deeds of warrior women<br> The shouting and the battle.<br> It is she who saves the people as they go to war,<br> That they may return to their peaceful homes.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">IV.</h3>  
<p>Hail Goddess Athena, I invoke thy dread name,<br> That I may be able to drive away bitter cowardice<br> From my head and crush down the deceitful impulses of my soul.<br> Restrain the keen fury of my heart which provokes me<br> To tread the ways of blood-curdling strife.<br> Strip the armor from your immortal shoulders<br> And bring us the blessings of peace and victory.<br> O blessed one, give thou boldness to me<br> To abide within the harmless laws of peace,<br> Avoiding strife and hatred and the violent fiends of death.<br> Goddess who holds the invincible aegis.</p>
