# MARIA

### I.

Hail to thee, Maria, Mother!  
Thou art full of loving grace,  
Thy Grace, O Goddess is always with us,  
Blessed art thou Maria among women,  
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb,  
Blessed art thou, Queen of grace;  
Thou holy Maria, thou Mother of Universes,  
Plead for me, thy grateful daughter,  
Now and at the hour of death,  
Now and at the hour of death.

### II.

Maria, Goddess of good omens,  
Mother of the seven joys;  
Without evil traces,  
On thee, peerless one:  
Joy of health,  
Joy of friends,  
Joy of lovers,  
Joy of peace,  
Joy of fair daughters,  
Joy of peace,  
Joy of the Goddess!  
Bounty and blessing thou art at all times.

### III.

O Goddess Maria,  
In my deeds,  
In my words,  
In my wishes,  
In my reason,  
And in the fulfilling of my desires,  
In my sleep,  
In my dreams,  
In my repose,  
In my thoughts,  
In my heart and soul always,  
May the blessed Maria dwell.  
Oh! in my heart and soul always!

### IV.

Goddess, listen to my prayer,  
Bend to me Thine ear,  
Let my supplications and my prayers  
Ascend to Thee upwards.  
Come, Thou Queen of Glory,  
To protect me down,  
Thou Queen of life and mercy  
To protect me with power,  
Oh thou loveliest Maria  
Of purest fairest beauty.

### V.

Oh great Goddess Maria  
I bathe my palms  
In showers of wine,  
In the lustral fire,  
In the quantum foam,  
In the juice of the berries,  
In the milk of honey,  
And I place the nine pure choice graces  
In thy fair fond face,  
The grace of form,  
The grace of voice,  
The grace of fortune,  
The grace of goodness,  
The grace of wisdom,  
The grace of charity,  
The grace of love given freely,  
The grace of kindness,  
The grace of goodly speech.

A shade art thou in the heat,  
A shelter art thou in the cold,  
Eyes art thou to the blind,  
A staff art thou to the pilgrim,  
An island art thou at sea,  
A fortress art thou on land,  
A well art thou in the desert,  
Health art thou to the ailing.

Thine is the skill of the Fairy Woman,  
Thine is the virtue of Bridget the calm,  
Thine is the faith of Maria the mild,  
Thine is the ecstasy of the Holy Goddess.

Thou art the joy of all joyous things,  
Thou art the light of the beam of the sun,  
Thou art the door of the chief of hospitality,  
Thou art the surpassing star of guidance,  
Thou art the step of the deer of the hill,  
Thou art the step of the steed of the plain,  
Thou art the grace of the swan of swimming,  
Thou art the loveliness of all lovely desires.  
The lovely likeness of the Goddess  
Is in thy pure face,  
The loveliest likeness that  
Was upon earth.

The best hour of the day be thine,  
The best day of the week be thine,  
The best week of the year be thine,  
The best year in the domain of the Goddess be thine.

### VI.

Goddess shield this house  
Every one who dwells herein tonight.  
Shield myself and my beloved group,  
Shield all those I love and are loved by me,  
Preserve us from violence and from harm;  
Preserve us from foes this night,  
Preserve us from persecution and hatred,  
For the sake of Maria the Mother,  
In this place, and in every place wherein they dwell tonight,  
On this night and on every night,  
This night and every night.

### VII.

Hail, Maria! hail, Maria!  
Queen of grace, Mother of mercy;  
Hail, Maria, in manner surpassing,  
Fount of our health, source of our joy.

To thee we, night and day,  
Beloved children of Maria,  
Lift our voice in supplication,  
In joy and song and praise.

Bestow upon us, thou Root of gladness,  
Since thou art the cup of generous graces,  
A place in the grove of peace,  
Rest from the perils and stress of waves.

### VIII.

On the feast day of Maria the fragrant,  
Mother of the Shepherd of the flocks,  
I cut me a handful of the new corn,  
I dried it gently in the sun,  
I rubbed it sharply from the husk  
With mine own palms.  
I ground it in a quern on Friday,  
I baked it on a fan of sheepskin,  
I toasted it to a fire of rowan,  
And I shared it round my people.  
I went sunways round my dwelling,  
In name of the Maria Mother,  
Who promised to preserve me,  
Who did preserve me,  
And who will preserve me,  
In peace, in flocks,  
In righteousness of heart,  
In labor, in love,  
In wisdom, in mercy,  
For the sake of Thy Passion.  
Thou Mother of grace  
Who till the day of my death  
Wilt never forsake me!  
Oh, till the day of my death  
Wilt never forsake me!

### IX.

*A Invocation of protection*

I trample upon the evil eye,  
As tramples the duck upon the lake,  
As tramples the swan upon the water,  
As tramples the horse upon the plain,  
As tramples the cow upon the heather,  
As tramples the host of the elements,  
As tramples the host of the elements.  
Power of wind I have over it,  
Power of wrath I have over it,  
Power of fire I have over it,  
Power of thunder I have over it,  
Power of lightning I have over it,  
Power of storms I have over it,  
Power of moon I have over it,  
Power of sun I have over it,  
Power of stars I have over it,  
Power of firmament I have over it,  
Power of the heavens  
And of the worlds I have over it,  
Power of the heavens  
And of the worlds I have over it.  
A portion of it upon the gray stones,  
A portion of it upon the steep hills,  
A portion of it upon the fast falls,  
A portion of it upon the fair meadows,  
And a portion upon the great salt sea,  
She herself is the best instrument to carry it,  
The great salt sea,  
The best instrument to carry it.  
In name of the Three of Life,  
In name of the Sacred Three,  
In name of all the Secret Ones,  
And of the Powers together.  
Three will I send to thwart them,  
Daughter,  
Mother,  
Spirit Holy.  
I appeal to Bridget,  
Maiden and Lover  
I appeal to Maria,  
Aidful mother of all,  
Goddess of shore and sea,  
And I appeal to the One Goddess,  
She of the many names and forms,  
To all Devas and beings of Light.  
If it be someone has done thee harm,  
With evil eye,  
With evil wish,  
With evil jealousy,  
May thou cast off each ill,  
Every malignity,  
Every malice,  
Every harassment,  
And may you be well for ever,  
While this thread  
Goes round thee,  
In honor of the Mother Maria,  
And of the Spirit of balm everlasting.

### X.

O Mary Mother,  
Goddess of the all encompassing Oceans,  
Never was known  
One who was placed  
Beneath thy generous care,  
Who asked thy mercy,  
Who asked thy shielding,  
Who asked thy succor  
With truthful heart,  
Who found not thy solace,  
Who found not thy peace,  
Who found not the succor  
For which she sought.  
That gives unto me  
The hope excelling  
That my kind desires  
May find sanctuary with thee.  
My heart is content  
To kneel at thy bedside,  
My heart is content  
In thy favor and hearing;  
To come into thy presence,  
Beauteous one of smiles,  
To come into thy presence,  
Beauteous one of women;  
To come into thy presence,  
Queen of all species,  
To come into thy presence,  
Queen-maiden of the worlds;  
To come into thy presence,  
O flower-garland of branches,  
To come into thy presence,  
Bright garland of the heavens;  
To come into thy presence,  
O river of seed,  
To come into thy presence,  
O vessel of peace;  
To come into thy presence,  
O fountain of healing,  
To come into thy presence,  
O well-spring of grace;  
To come into thy presence,  
Thou dwelling of meekness,  
To come into thy presence,  
Thou home of peace;  
To come into thy presence,  
Thou jewel of the clouds,  
To come into thy presence,  
Thou jewel of the stars;  
To come into thy presence,  
O Mother of black sorrow,  
To come into thy presence,  
O Mother of the Goddess of glory;  
To come into thy presence,  
Thou Virgin of the lowly,  
To come into thy presence,  
Thou Mother of Universes;  
With lament and with sorrow,  
With prayer and supplication,  
With grief and with weeping,  
With invoking and entreaty;  
That thou may have me spared  
Shame and disgrace,  
That thou may have me spared  
Flattery and scorn;  
That thou may have me spared  
Misery and mourning,  
That thou may have me spared  
Anguish eternal;  
That thou may help my soul  
On the highway of the Queen,  
That thou may help my soul  
On the roadway of peace;  
That thou may help my soul  
In the doorway of mercy,  
That thou may help my soul  
In the place of justice.  
Since thou art the star of ocean,  
Pilot me at sea;  
Since thou art the star of earth,  
Guide thou me on shore.  
Since thou art the star of night,  
Lighten me in the darkness;  
Since thou art the sun of day,  
Encompass me on land.  
Since thou art the star of Devas,  
Watch over me on earth;  
Since thou art the star of paradise,  
Companion me to heaven.  
May thou shield me by night,  
May thou shield me by day,  
May thou shield me by day and night,  
O bright and gracious Queen of heaven.  
Grant me my prayer of love,  
Grant me my entreaty for shielding,  
Grant me my supplication of pain  
Count me not as naught, O my Goddess,  
Count me not as naught, O my Sister,  
Count me not as naught, O kind Spirit,  
And abandon me not to eternal loss.

### XII.

Thou art the Queen-maiden of sweetness,  
Thou art the Queen-maiden of love-giving,  
Thou art the Queen-maiden of peacefulness  
And of the peoples.  
Thou art the well of compassion,  
Thou art the root of consolations,  
Thou art the living stream of the virgins  
And of them who bear child.  
Thou art the Queen-maiden of the sea,  
Thou art the Queen-maiden of the kingdom,  
Thou art the Queen-maiden of the angels  
In effulgence.  
Thou art the temple of the Goddess of life,  
Thou art the tabernacle of the Goddess of life,  
Thou art the mansion of the Goddess of life  
And of the forlorn.  
Thou art the river of grace,  
Thou art the well-spring of salvation,  
Thou art the garden and the paradise  
Of the virgins.  
Thou art the star of morning,  
Thou art the star of watching,  
Thou art the star of the ocean  
Great.  
Thou art the star of the earth,  
Thou art the star of the dawn,  
Thou art the star of the goddess  
Of glory.  
Thou art the corn of the land,  
Thou art the treasury of the sea,  
The wished-for visitant of the homes  
Of the world.  
Thou art the vessel of fullness,  
Thou art the cup of wisdom,  
Thou art the well-spring of health  
Of womankind.  
Thou art the garden of virtues,  
Thou art the mansion of gladness,  
Thou art the Mother of sadness  
And of clemency.  
Thou art the garden of apples,  
Thou art the lull-song of the great folks,  
Thou art the fulfillment of the world's desire  
In loveliness.  
Thou art the sun of the heavens,  
Thou art the moon of the skies,  
Thou art the star and the path  
Of the wanderers.  
Since thou art the full ocean,  
Pilot me at sea;  
Since thou art the dry shore,  
Save me upon land.  
Since thou art the gem of the jewel,  
Save me from fire and from water,  
Save me from sky-hosts of evil  
And from fairy shafts.  
There is none who utters my song  
Or puts it into use,  
But Mary will show herself  
Three times before her death and her end.

### XIII.

Flower-garland of the ocean,  
Flower-garland of the land,  
Flower-garland of the heavens,  
Mary, Mother of Universes.  
Flower-garland of the earth,  
Flower-garland of the skies,  
Flower-garland of the Devas,  
Mary, Mother of Universes.  
Flower-garland of the mansion,  
Flower-garland of the stars,  
Flower-garland of paradise,  
Mary, Mother of Universes.
