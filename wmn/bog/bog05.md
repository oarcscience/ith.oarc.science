# HYMNS TO THE ONE GODDESS

### I.

Oh Goddess,  
You Yourself are the Creator. Everything that happens is by Your
Doing.  
There is no one except You.

You created the creation; You behold it and understand it.  
Amongst all is the Light--You are that Light.  
By this Illumination, that Light is radiant within all.  
The Goddess is the Greatest of the Great. No one calls Her any less.  
No one can estimate Her Worth. By speaking of Her, Her Greatness is not
increased.  
You are the One True Mistress of all the other beings, of so many
worlds.  
Come, my dear sisters and spiritual companions; hug me close in your
embrace.  
You have so many Creative Powers, Mistress; Your Bountiful Blessings are
so Great.  
So many of Your beings and creatures praise You day and night.  
You have so many forms and colors, so many classes, high and low.  
Meeting the True One, Truth wells up. The truthful are absorbed into the
True Goddess.  
Upon that Highest Plane of Sublime Beauty, stands the Grove of the
Goddess.  
By true actions, this human body is obtained,  
And the door within ourselves which leads to the Grove of the Goddess,
is found.  
The True Goddess Herself knows all; She makes no mistakes.  
She is the Great Gardener of the Universe.  
First, She prepares the ground, and then She plants the Seed of the True
Name.  
The nine treasures are produced from Name of the One Goddess.  
The blind have forgotten the Name of the Goddess.  
Their comings and goings in reincarnation do not end;  
Through death and rebirth, they are wasting away.  
Without the Word of the Goddess, people wander lost in reincarnation.  
Through the love of duality, multitudes have been drowned.  
O mind, swim across, by focusing your consciousness on Her names.  
As it pleases You, Mistress, You save me. There is no other for me at
all.  
In front of me, I see the forest burning; behind me, I see green plants
sprouting.  
We shall merge into the One from whom we came.  
The True One is pervading each and every heart.  
She Herself unites us in Union with Herself;  
The True Mansion of Her Presence is close at hand.

With each and every breath, I dwell upon You; I shall never forget
You.  
The more the Goddess dwells within the mind,  
The more the lover of the Goddess drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar.  
Mind and body are Yours; You are my Mistress.  
Please rid me of my hate, my jealousy, and my ignorance, and let me
merge with You.  
Everyone belongs to the One who rules the Universe.  
The lover of the Goddess practices good deeds, and the truth is revealed
in the heart.  
True is the reputation of the true, within whom truth abides.  
Those who meet the True Goddess are not separated again;  
They come to dwell in the home of the self deep within.  
O mind, don't cry out that you are hungry, always hungry; stop
complaining.  
The One who created the infinite species of beings gives sustenance to
all.  
The Fearless Goddess is forever Merciful; She takes care of all.

O lover of the Goddess, She understands, and finds the Door of
Liberation.  
Those who keep the Goddess enshrined within their hearts are said to be
blessed.  
Placing mind and body in offering before the Goddess,  
They conquer and eradicate jealousy from within.  
Blessed and acclaimed is that lover of the Goddess, who shall never be
defeated.  
Those who receive Her Grace find Her;  
Without Her Grace, She cannot be found.  
In the Grove of the Goddess, peace is found,  
Meditating on Her nine billion names night and day.  
The truthful ones are not stained by hate.  
Meditating on the Goddess, their minds remain pure;  
The lovers of the Goddess shed their ego; attuned to her orgasm, they
find peace.  
The One Goddess is the Giver of all; She Herself bestows all
blessings.  
No one else has any say in this; She gives just as She pleases.

O mind, vibrate and meditate forever on the Goddess; seek the Protection
of Her Grove.  
The Mistress of the Universe is the Treasure of Excellence; Her limits
cannot be found.  
She is not obtained by mouthing mere words, but by rooting out jealousy
from within.  
By Goddess' Grace, one remains blended with the True Name of the
Creatrix;  
This mind is very powerful; we cannot escape it just by trying.  
In the love of duality, people suffer in pain, condemned to terrible
punishment.  
O mind, give up the love of duality.  
The Goddess dwells within you; serving the Goddess, you shall find
peace.  
Engrossed in jealousy, the world perishes.  
It dies and is re-born; it continues coming and going in
reincarnation.  
The self-willed do not recognize the Goddess;  
They forfeit their honor, and depart in disgrace.

The True Queen has written Her Order, which no one can erase.  
The self-willed do not obtain the Grove of the Goddess' Presence.  
The false are plundered by falsehood.  
Engrossed in egotism, the world perishes.  
Without the Goddess, there is utter darkness.  
In emotional attachment to one lover, they have forgotten the Great
Giver, the Giver of Peace.  
Those who serve the True Goddess are saved;  
They keep the True Goddess enshrined in their hearts.  
By Her Grace, we find the Queen, and reflect on the True Word of the
Goddess.  
The desires of the mind are fulfilled, when one is filled to overflowing
with Her orgasm.  
One who fears, loves, and is devoted to the Dear Goddess day and
night,  
Sees Her always close at hand.  
Doubt runs far away from the bodies of those,  
Whose minds remain forever attuned to the True Word of the Goddess.  
The Immaculate Mistress is found. She is True; She is the Ocean of
Excellence.  
Those who remain awake and aware are saved, while those who sleep are
plundered.  
They do not recognize the True Word of the Goddess, and like a dream,
their lives fade away.  
Like guests in a deserted house, they leave just exactly as they have
come.
