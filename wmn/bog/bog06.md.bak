### II.

By the Sun and Her brightness,  
And the Moon when She follows Her,  
And the day when it reveals Her,  
And the Night when it enshrouds Her,  
And the Sky and She who created it,  
And the Earth and She who quickened it.  
By the night enshrouding;  
And the day resplendent;  
And She Who hath created Orgasm  
As for the lovers who are dutiful to the Goddess  
And believe in her goodness;  
Surely We will ease their way to the Grove of the Goddess  
But as for they who are jealous, hateful and scorn knowledge,  
And disbelieve in goodness;  
Surely She will ease their way to adversity.  
Their riches will not save them when they perish;  
Lo! Hers it is to give the guidance.
