# ATHENA

### I.

Athena, exceeding in strength, chariot-rider, golden-helmed,  
Doughty in heart, shield-bearer,  
Goddess of all cunning knowledge from fire to nanotechnology,  
Harnessed in armor, strong of arm, unwearying,  
Mighty with the spear, O defender of Goddess-votaries,  
Daughter of War, upholder of Peace,  
Pure virgin queen of mercy,  
Mother of all victory,  
Leader of righteous women,  
Sceptred Queen of Matriarchs.

### II.

Athena, you whirl your blood-red sphere among the planets  
In their nine-fold courses through the solar sphere  
Wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above  
The firmament of heaven; hear me, helper of women,  
Giver of dauntless youth!

### III.

I sing of Athena, Goddess of warriors,  
Shed down a kindly ray from above upon my life,  
And strength of war,  
Dread is she, and loves deeds of warrior women  
The shouting and the battle.  
It is she who saves the people as they go to war,  
That they may return to their peaceful homes.

### IV.

Hail Goddess Athena, I invoke thy dread name,  
That I may be able to drive away bitter cowardice  
From my head and crush down the deceitful impulses of my soul.  
Restrain the keen fury of my heart which provokes me  
To tread the ways of blood-curdling strife.  
Strip the armor from your immortal shoulders  
And bring us the blessings of peace and victory.  
O blessed one, give thou boldness to me  
To abide within the harmless laws of peace,  
Avoiding strife and hatred and the violent fiends of death.  
Goddess who holds the invincible aegis.
