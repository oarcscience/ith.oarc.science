Unveiling a Parallel was a collaboration between two 19th century US
women writers who lived in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Like Charlotte Gilman's
[Herland](../hrl/index.md), it has a fairly standard framing story. This
title, however, has a bit more balance between exposition and narrative
than most. It also has some strong women characters, unlike the
male-penned utopias where women are, more than often, just set-dressing.

The unnamed narrator, a man, arrives at [Mars](../../ufo/mars/index.md)
after a flight by 'aeroplane.' (Note that this was written a decade
before the Wright Brothers.) Mars is much like Earth, and inhabited by
Earth-like flora and fauna. Where it differs is in the social roles of
the genders. Women occupy a place of equality; they have their own
social clubs, take lovers, have children out of wedlock, and can even
propose marriage to men. Of course, this subjects the narrator to much
amusing discomfort. In the second part of the narrative, set in another
country on Mars, the protagonist gets to meet a Christ-like 'Teacher,'
and compare religion on both planets. This portion seems a bit
tacked-on, as if the authors felt a need to soften the impact of the
satire in the previous part of the book.

Unveiling a Parallel appears on the Internet for the first time at
Intangible Textual Heritage. There were numerous feminist utopias
written during this period, all unknown today except to specialists.
Hopefully more of these can be digitized.
