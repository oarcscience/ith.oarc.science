# CHAPTER XVI

### WHY NOT BIRTH-CONTROL CLINICS IN AMERICA\[\*\]

THE absurd cruelty of permitting thousands of women each year to go
through abortions to prevent the aggravation of diseases for which they
are under treatment assuredly cannot be much longer ignored by the
medical profession. Responsibility for the inestimable damage done by
the practice of permitting patients suffering from certain ailments to
become pregnant, because of their ignorance of contraceptives, when the
physician knows that if pregnancy goes to its full term it will hasten
the disease and lead to the patient's death, must in all fairness be
laid at his door.

What these diseases are and what dangers are involved in pregnancy are
known to every practitioner of standing. Specialists have not been
negligent in pointing out the situation.

\[\* This chapter, in substance, and largely in language, appeared under
the present title in the March, 1920, issue of American Medicine (New
York) and is incorporated in this book by courtesy of that
publication.\]

{p. 199} Eager to enhance or protect their reputations in the
profession, they continually call out to one another: "Don't let the
patient bear a child--don't let pregnancy continue."

The warning has been sounded most often, perhaps, in the cases of
tubercular women. "In view of the fact that the tubercular process
becomes exacerbated either during pregnancy or after childbirth, most
authorities recommend that abortion be induced as a matter of routine in
all tubercular women," says Dr. J. Whitridge Williams,
obstetrician-in-chief to the Johns Hopkins Hospital, in his treatise on
*Obstetrics*. Dr. Thomas Watts Eden, obstetrician and gynecologist to
Charing Cross Hospital and member of the staffs of other notable British
hospitals, extends but does not complete the list in this paragraph on
page 652 of his *Practical Obstetrics*, "Certain of the conditions
enumerated form absolute indications for the induction of abortion.
These are nephritis, uncompensated valvular lesions of the heart,
advanced tuberculosis, insanity, irremediable maligant tumors,
hydatidiform mole, uncontrollable uterine hemorrhage, and acute
hydramnios."

{p. 200}

We know that abortion, when performed by skilled hands, under right
conditions, brings almost no danger to the life of the patient, and we
also know that particular diseases can be more easily combatted after
such an abortion than during a pregnancy allowed to come to full term.
But why not adopt the easier, safer, less repulsive course and prevent
conception altogether? Why put these thousands of women who each year
undergo such abortions to the pain they entail and in whatever danger
attends them?

Why continue to send home women to whom pregnancy is a grave danger with
the futile advice: "Now don't get this way again!" They are sent back to
husbands who have generations of passion and passion's claim to outlet.
They are sent back without being given information as to how to prevent
the dangerous pregnancy and are expected, presumably, to depend for
their safety upon the husband's continence. The wife and husband are
thrown together to bring about once more the same condition. Back comes
the patient again in a few months to be aborted and told once more not
to do it again.

{p. 201}

Does any physician believe that the picture is overdrawn? I have known
of many such cases. A recent one that came under my observation was that
of a woman who suffered from a disease of the kidneys. Five times she
was taken to a maternity hospital in an ambulance after falling in
offices or in the street. One of the foremost gynecologists of America
sent her out three times without giving her information as to the
contraceptive means which would have prevented a repetition of this
experience.

Why does this situation exist? We do not question the good intent nor
the high purposes of these physicians. We know that they observe a high
standard of ethics and that they are working for the uplift of the race.
But here is a situation that is absurd -hideously absurd. What is the
matter?

Several factors contribute to this state of affairs. First, the subject
of contraception has been kept in the dark, even in medical colleges and
in hospitals. Abortion has been openly discussed as a necessity under
certain conditions, but the subject of contraception, as any physician
will admit, has. not yet been

{p. 202}

brought to the front. It has escaped specialized attention in the
laboratories and the research departments. Thus there has been no
professional stamp of approval by great bodies of experimenters. The
result is that the average physician has felt that contraceptive methods
are not yet established as certainties and has, for that reason, refused
to direct their use.

Specialists are so busy with their own particular subjects and general
practitioners are so taken up with their daily routine that they cannot
give to the problem of contraception the attention it must have.
Consultation rooms in charge of reputable physicians who have
specialized in contraception, assisted by registered nurses--in a word,
clinics designed for this specialty, would meet this crying need. Such
clinics should deal with each woman individually, taking into account
her particular disease, her temperament, her mentality and her
condition, both physical and economic. Their sole function should be to
prevent pregnancy. In accomplishing this purpose, a higher standard of
hygiene is attained. Not only would a burden be removed from the

{p. 203}

physician who sends a woman to such a clinic, but there would be an
improvement in the woman's general condition which would in a number of
ways reflect itself in benefit to her family.

All this for the diseased woman. But every argument that can be made for
preventive medicine can be made for birth-control clinics for the use of
the woman who has not yet lost her health. Sound and vigorous at the
time of her marriage, she could remain so if given advice as to by what
means she could space her children and limit their number. When she is
not given such information, she is plunged blindly into married life and
a few years is likely to find her with a large family, herself diseased
and damaged, an unfit breeder of the unfit, and still ignorant!

What are the fruits of this woeful ignorance in which women have been
kept? First, a tremendous infant mortality--hundreds of thousands of
babies dying annually of diseases which flourish in poverty and neglect.

Next, the rapid increase of the feebleminded, of criminal types and of
the pathetic victims of toil in the child-labor factories. Another

{p. 204}

result is the familiar overcrowding of tenements, the forcing of the
children into the street, the ensuing prostitution, alcoholism and
almost universal physical and moral unfitness.

Those abhorrent conditions point to a blunder--upon the part of those to
whom we have entrusted the care of the health of the individual, the
family and the race. The medical profession, neglecting the principle
involved in preventive medicine, has permitted these conditions to come
about. If they were unavoidable, we should have to bear with them, but
they are not unavoidable, as shown by facts and figures from other
countries where contraceptive information is available.

In Holland, for instance, where the information concerning
contraceptives has been accessible to the people, through clinics and
pamphlets, since 1881, the general death rate and the infant mortality
rate have fallen until they are the lowest in Europe. Amsterdam and The
Hague have the lowest infant mortality rates of any cities in the world.

It is good to know that the first of the birth-control clinics of
Holland followed shortly

{p. 205}

after a thorough and enthusiastic discussion of the subject at an
international medical congress in Amsterdam in 1878. The Dutch
Neo-Malthusian League was founded in 1881. The first birth-control
clinic in the world was opened in 1885 by Dr. Aletta Jacobs in
Amsterdam. So great were the results obtained that there has been a
remarkable increase in the wealth, stamina, stature and longevity of the
people, as well as a gradual increase in the population.

These clinics must not be confused with the white enameled rooms which
we associate with the term in America. They are ordinary offices with
the necessary equipment, or rooms in the homes of the nurses, fitted out
for the work. They are places for consultation and examination, opened
by specially trained nurses who have been instructed by Dr. J. Rutgers,
of The Hague, secretary of the Neo-Malthusian League, who has devoted
his life to this work. There have been more than fifty nurses trained
specially for this work by Dr. Rutgers. As a nurse completes her course
of training, she establishes herself in a community and her place of
consultation is called a clinic.

{p. 206}

The general results of this service are best judged by tables included
in the *Annual Summary of Marriages, Births and Deaths in England,
Wales, Etc.*, for 1912.\[\*\]

In Amsterdam, the birth rate dropped from 37.1 for the period of 1881-85
to 24.7 for 1906 and 23.3 in 1912. During the same periods, the death
rate fell from 25.1 to 13.1, and in 1912 to 11.2. Infant mortality for
the same period fell from 203 for each thousand living births to 90, and
in 1912 to 64. Illegitimate fertility also decreased. Results in other
cities, as shown by the table at the end of this chapter, are exactly
similar.

In the Australian Commonwealth, where birth control is taken as a matter
of course, and information concerning contraceptives is available to the
masses, the births were so well distributed in 1915 that while the birth
rate was 27.3, there was an infant death rate of only 10.7. New Zealand,
which is also one of the typical birth-control countries, had a birth
rate of 25.3 and an infant death rate of only 9.1 for the same year.
These figures are in marked and happy contrast with those for the birth
registration of the United States, where

\[(\*See table on page 208.)\]

{p. 207}

the reports for 1916 show a birth rate of 24.9, but an infant death rate
of 14.7. A similar comparison may be made with the German Empire in
1913., where there was a birth rate of 27.5 in 1913 and an infant
mortality rate of 15. In these countries, birth control information is
not so generally within the reach of the masses and, consequently, the
largest percentage of births come to that class least able to bring
children to full maturity, as indicated in the infant mortality rates.

In conclusion, I am going to make a statement which may at first seem
exaggerated, but which is, nevertheless, carefully considered. The
effort toward racial progress that is being made to-day by the medical
profession, by social workers, by the various charitable and
philanthropic organizations and by state institutions for the physically
and mentally unfit, is practically wasted. All these forces are in a
very emphatic sense marking time. They will continue to mark time until
the medical profession recognizes the fact that the ever increasing tide
of the unfit is overwhelming all

that these agencies are doing for society. They will continue to mark
time until they get at

{p. 208}

the source of these destructive conditions and apply a fundamental
remedy. That remedy is birth control.
