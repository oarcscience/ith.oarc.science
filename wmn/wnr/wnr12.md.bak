# CHAPTER X

### CONTRACEPTIVES OR ABORTION?

SOCIETY has not yet learned the significance of the age-long effort of
the feminine spirit to free itself of the burden of excessive
childbearing. It has been singularly blind to the real forces underlying
the cause of infanticide, child abandonment and abortion. It has
permitted the highest and most powerful thing in woman's nature to be
hindered, diverted, repressed and confused. Society has permitted this
inner urge of woman to be rendered violent by repression until it has
expressed itself in cruel forms of family limitation, which this same
society has promptly labeled "crimes" and sought to punish. It has gone
on blindly forcing women into these "crimes," deaf alike to their
entreaties and to the lessons of history.

As we have seen in the second chapter of this book, child abandonment
and infanticide are by no means obsolete practices. As for

{p. 119}

abortion, it has not decreased but increased with the advance of
civilization. The reader will recall that one authority says that there
are 1,000,000 abortions in the United States every year, while another
estimates double that number.

Most of the women of the middle and upper classes in America seem secure
in their knowledge of contraceptives as a means of birth control. Under
present conditions, when the laws in most states regard this knowledge,
howsoever it be imparted, as illicit, and the federal statutes prohibit
the sending of it through the mails, even the women in more fortunate
circumstances sometimes have difficulty in getting scientific
information. Nevertheless, so strong is their purpose that they do
obtain it and use it, correctly or incorrectly.

The great majority of women, however, belong to the working class.
Nearly all of these women will fall into one of two general groups--the
ones who are having children against their wills, and those who, to
escape this evil, find refuge in abortion. Being given their choice by
society--to continue to be overburdened mothers or to submit to a
humiliating,

{p. 120}

repulsive, painful and too often gravely dangerous operation, those
women in whom the feminine urge to freedom is strongest choose the
abortionist. One group goes on bringing children to birth, hoping that
they will be born dead or die. The women of the other group strive
consciously by drastic means to protect themselves and the children
already born.

"Our examinations," says Dr. Max Hirsch, an authority on the subject,
"have informed us that the largest number of abortions (in the United
States) are performed on married women. This fact brings us to the
conclusion that contraceptive measures among the upper classes and the
practice of abortion among the lower class, are the real means employed
to regulate the number of offspring."

Thus a high percentage of women in comfortable circumstances escape
overbreeding by the use of contraceptives. A similarly high percentage
of women not in comfortable circumstances are forced to submit to forced
maternity, because their only alternative at present is abortion. When
accidental conception takes place, some women of both classes

{p. 121}

resort to abortion if they can obtain the services of an abortionist.

When society holds up its hands in horror at the "crime" of abortion, it
forgets at whose door the first and principal responsibility for this
practice rests. Does anyone imagine that a woman would submit to
abortion if not denied the knowledge of scientific, effective
contraceptives? Does anyone believe that physicians and midwives who
perform abortions go from door to door soliciting patronage? The
abortionist could not continue his practice for twenty-four hours if it
were not for the fact that women come desperately begging for such
operations. He could not stay out of jail a day if women did not so
generally approve of his services as to hold his identity an open but
seldom-betrayed secret.

The question, then, is not whether family limitation should be
practiced. It *is* being practiced; it has been practiced for ages and
it will always be practiced. The question that society must answer is
this: Shall family limitation be achieved through birth control or
abortion? Shall normal, safe, effective contraceptives be employed, or
shall we continue to force

{p. 122}

women to the abnormal, often dangerous surgical operation?

This question, too, the church, the state and the moralist must answer.
The knowledge of contraceptive methods may yet for a time be denied to
the woman of the working class, but those who are responsible for
denying it to her, and she herself, should understand clearly the
dangers to which she is exposed because of the laws which force her into
the hands of the abortionist.

To understand the more clearly the difference between birth control by
contraceptives and family limitation through abortion it is necessary to
know something of the processes of conception. Knowledge of these
processes will also enable us to comprehend more thoroughly the dangers
to which woman is exposed by our antiquated laws, and how much better it
would be for her to employ such preventive measures as would keep her
out of the hands of the abortionist, into which the laws now drive her.

In every woman's ovaries are imbedded millions of ovules or eggs. They
are in every female at birth, and as the girl develops into

{p. 123}

At a womanhood, these ovules develop also. At a certain age, varying
slightly with the individual, the ripest ovule leaves the nest or ovary
and comes down one of the tubes connecting with the womb and passes out
of the body. When this takes place, it is said that the girl is at the
age of puberty. When it reaches the womb the ovule is ready for the
process of conception--that is, fertilization by the male sperm.

At the time the ovule is ripening, the womb is preparing to receive it.
This preparation consists of a reinforced blood supply brought to its
lining. If fertilization takes place, the fertilized ovule or ovum will
cling to the lining of the womb and there gather its nourishment. If
fertilization does not take place, the ovum passes out of the body and
the uterus throws off its surplus blood supply. This is called the
menstrual period. It occurs about once a month or every twenty-eight
days.

In the male organs there are glands called testes. They secrete a fluid
called the semen. In the semen is the life-giving principle called the
sperm.

When intercourse takes place, if no preventive

{p. 124}

is employed, the semen is deposited in the woman's vagina. The ovule is
not in the vagina, but is in the womb, farther up, or perhaps in the
tube on its way to the womb. As steel is attracted to the magnet, the
sperm of the male starts on its way to seek the ovum. Several of these
sperm cells start, but only one enters the ovum and is absorbed into it.
This process is called fertilization, conception or impregnation.

If no children are desired, the meeting of the male sperm and the ovum
must be prevented. When scientific means are employed to prevent this
meeting, one is said to practice birth control. The means used is known
as a contraceptive.

If, however, a contraceptive is not used and the sperm meets the ovule
and development begins, any attempt at removing it or stopping its
further growth is called abortion.

There is no doubt that women are apt to look upon abortion as of little
consequence and to treat it accordingly. An abortion is as important a
matter as a confinement and requires as much attention as the birth of a
child at its full term,

{p. 125}

"The immediate dangers of abortion," says Dr. J. Clifton Edgar, in his
book, "*The Practice of Obstetrics*," "are hemorrhage, retention of an
adherent placenta, sepsis, tetanus, perforation of the uterus. They also
cause sterility, anemia, malignant diseases, displacements, neurosis,
and endometritis."

In plain, everyday language, in an abortion there is always a very
serious risk to the health and often to the life of the patient.

It is only the women of wealth who can afford the best medical skill,
care and treatment both at the time of the operation and afterwards. In
this way they escape the usual serious consequences.

The women whose incomes are limited and who must continue at work before
they have recovered from the effects of an abortion are the great army
of sufferers. It is among such that the deaths due to abortion usually
ensue. It is these, too, who are most often forced to resort to such
operations.

If death does not result, the woman who has undergone an abortion is not
altogether safe from harm. The womb may not return to its natural size,
but remain large and heavy, tending

{p. 126}

to fall away from its natural position. Abortion often leaves the uterus
in a condition to conceive easily again and unless prevention is
strictly followed another pregnancy will surely occur. Frequent
abortions tend to cause barrenness and serious, painful pelvic ailments.
These and other conditions arising from such operations are very likely
to ruin a woman's general health.

While there are cases where even the law recognizes an abortion as
justifiable if recommended by a physician, I assert that the hundreds of
thousands of abortions performed in America each year are a disgrace to
civilization.

The effects of such operations upon a woman, serious as they may be, are
nothing as compared to the injury done her general health by drugs taken
to produce the same result. Even such drugs as are prescribed by
physicians have harmful effects, and nostrums recommended by druggists
are often worse still.

Even more drastic may be the effect upon the unborn child, for many
women fill their systems with poisonous drugs during the first weeks of
their pregnancy, only to decide at

{p. 127}

last, when drugs have failed, as they usually do, to bring the child to
birth.

There are no statistics, of course, by which we may compute the amount
of suffering to mother and child from the use of such drugs, but we know
that the total of physical weakness and disease must be astounding. We
know that the woman's own system feels the strain of these drugs and
that the embryo is usually poisoned by them. The child is likely to be
rickety, have heart trouble, kidney disorder, or to be generally weak in
its powers of resistance. If it does not die before it reaches its first
year, it is probable that it will have to struggle against some of these
weaknesses until its adolescent period.

It needs no assertion of mine to call attention to the grim fact that
the laws prohibiting the imparting of information concerning the
preventing of conception are responsible for tens of thousands of deaths
each year in this country and an untold amount of sickness and sorrow.
The suffering and the death of these women is squarely upon the heads of
the lawmakers and the puritanical, masculine-minded

{p. 128}

person who insist upon retaining the abominable legal restrictions.

Try as they will they cannot escape the truth, nor hide it under the
cloak of stupid hypocrisy. If the laws against imparting knowledge of
scientific birth control were repealed, nearly all of the 1,000,000 or
2,000,000 women who undergo abortions in the United States each year
would escape the agony of the surgeon's instruments and the long trail
of disease, suffering and death which so often follows.

"He who would combat abortion," says Dr. Hirsch, "and at the same time
combat contraceptive measures may be likened to the person who would
fight contagious diseases and forbid disinfection. For contraceptive
measures are important weapons in the fight against abortion.

"America has a law since 1873 which prohibits by criminal statute the
distribution and regulation of contraceptive measures. It follows,
therefore, that America stands at the head of all nations in the huge
number of abortions."

There is the case in a nutshell. Family

{p. 129}

limitation will always be practiced as it is now being practiced--either
by birth control or by abortion. We know that. The one means health and
happiness--a stronger, better race. The other means disease, suffering,
death.

The woman who goes to the abortionist's table is not a criminal but a
martyr--a martyr to the bitter, unthinkable conditions brought about by
the blindness of society at large. These conditions give her the choice
between the surgeon's instruments and the sacrificing of what is highest
and holiest in her--her aspiration to freedom, her desire to protect the
children already hers. These conditions--not the woman--outface society
with this question:

"Contraceptives or Abortion--which shall it be?"
