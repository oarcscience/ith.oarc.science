As for the nonbelievers, you will find there is not a reason to admonish
them, </span>

they will not begin to believe from your admonishments, </span>

only through the plans of Goddess.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.7
For now, they have sealed up their own hearts and hearing;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a
dimness covers their seeing; and they shall suffer sadness, until they
become faithful to Goddess.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.8
There are some who will say, “We believe in Goddess and the last day;”
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
they are not really believers; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.9
they seek to deceive Goddess, and those who do believe, but they deceive
only themselves,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
they have no common sense. For Goddess knows all your thoughts, your
heart and your soul.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.10
For their hearts are sick with darkness, and Goddess grieves for them,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
on the day of their resurrection, they will be greatly saddened, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
they see all the pain they caused to others, because they did not seek
the light.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.11
When they are told they should not do evil, they reply</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“What
are you talking about, we only want peace,”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.12
But they do not want peace, and they only show a great desire for war
and aggression.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.13
When they are implored, “Believe as others do in Goddess,” </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
respond, “Should we believe as fools believe?” Accordingly, they show
themselves to be fools. </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.14
When they meet others who believe, they say, “Of course, I believe,” but
in private,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
worship their devils and say they love the darkness and evil, and only
mock Goddess. </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.15
Goddess only grieves for them in their impiety and they shall wander in
confusion.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.16
These are people who have purchased error at the price of true guidance;
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
their endeavors will not be profitable, for they have not put their foot
upon the right path.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.17
They are like those women that kindle a fire to bring light all around
them, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
when the wood burned out, they were left alone and in darkness. </span>

<span style="font-size:

never.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">

up no evil or dark entities with Goddess, for She is pure love and

then She created the heavens and formed them into seven heavens; </span>

is great and merciful and knows all things.</span>

When your Lady said to the angels, </span>

We are most concerned.”</span>

Goddess answered and said, “Certainly I know so very much more than you
are aware of, </span>

Then She taught Eve the names of all things on earth and presented Eve
to the angels.</span>

then proposed them to the angels and said, “Declare to me the names of
all these things.”</span>

we have no knowledge but other than what You teach us, </span>

Goddess then said, “Eve, please tell us their names.”</span>

the new creature, Eve,</span>

all obeyed, except Eblis who refused, and was puffed up with pride

eat of all the fruit they found within, whenever desired; </span>

<span style="font-size:

<span style="font-size:

then caused them to forfeit paradise, </span>

<span style="font-size:

turned them out of their state of happiness and joy which they

been disobeyed, </span>

was not angry,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>but knew that it

Eve and Adam learned words of proper prayer from their Lady of Light,

kind of food to eat. </span>

garlic, cucumbers and onions, which is what we were used to.”</span>

<span style="font-size:

worse?” <span style="mso-tab-count:1">         </span></span>

then those that grumbled and complained were visited by soul suffering

in such a manner many will come to understand the Love of Goddess for
them. </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
is because Goddess is not unaware of what you do.</span>

But there are some people that hear this Korana and then tamper with the
words,</span>

<span style="font-size:

“Goddess is mean, Goddess is hateful, Goddess is jealous,” and they also
relate that She has for them,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a
wide variety of base human emotions. Yet they should know that this way
is incorrect.</span>

<span style="font-size:

when they privately meet together, they say “Tell us what Goddess has
revealed to you,” </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
this is only to engage in disputes with you. They do not wish to hear;
they do not wish to know.</span>

<span style="font-size:

tell false stories, and it is incumbent upon you, the literate and

there is none better to baptize you than your Goddess. To Her we give
all our love and praise.</span><sup><span

Others should not dispute with you concerning Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">who
is your Lady of Light and the Queen of Angels.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">We
have our work and you have yours, and we both should be completely
devoted to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.140
Remember that Eve and Adam were not Jewish, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor
was Yeshua or Mother Mary or Mary Magdalene Christian, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet
they were devoted prophets and prophetesses of Goddess. </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It
is indeed sad that when one feels the need to hide or obscure the
testimony of Goddess.</span><sup><span

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
Goddess is never regardless of what you do, for She loves and cares for
you dearly.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.141
Each of these prophetesses came from a righteous community that is long
gone;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
they will all receive the reward of all the good deeds they have
performed.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">When
people pass away, they have what they have gained in this life, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you shall have what you have gained in this life, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
it makes no sense to question or answer those who question the gains
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
are made during any woman’s lifetime; to gain during your life is to
learn new paths of love.</span>

The foolish person would say, “What could possibly direct a true
prophetess to</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">turn
to the opposite direction to pray?” But know this, that Goddess owns the
east and west </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
She directs Her prophetesses as She pleases.</span><sup><span

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Thus
you have been directed by Goddess so that you may be </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">a
stellar example to humanity and to your prophetess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
know that you are one that promptly does whatever Goddess desires is
best for you.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.143
We have made you a nation exalted and just, so that you may be a guiding
example </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
all womankind, and the perfect prophetess will be a guiding example to
you.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You
were told to pray to Keblah, so Goddess could readily see who followed
Her favored apostle, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
then back again to determine who can completely turn around on her heels
for Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.144
We see you, O prophetess turn your head toward heaven in prayer,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
we believe you will like to turn your head towards the direction of your
pleasing,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
certainly, Goddess will not disregard prayers in any direction, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
all prayers are turned towards heaven, out of love for Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
certainly the scholars know that this would be a good direction to pray
in,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
this is a direction from Goddess, for She is gracious and merciful,
compassionate and kind.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.145
Therefore, turn your heads toward Mecca, or turn towards any pious
shrine,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
your heart and love of Goddess directs you. For the faithful that
receive these Scriptures </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">know
this to be the truth that directly descends from their Lady of Light.
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">As
for the unbelievers, they would not follow your prayers or your
directions, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">no
matter what you made them to be. So turn your heads and hearts as what
best pleases you.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
is not regardless of at you do; for She loves you and cares for you with
a tender heart. </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Many
have been given the Scriptures and signs of Goddess, and Her love
surrounds them, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet
they do not follow their Keblah, be it Jewish or Arabian or of another
religion.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.146
But if they follow vain and empty worldly desires, after the Scripture
has been given them,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
they are the ungoddessly, lost and without true help and
protection,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
so they waiver and are full of doubt.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.147
But this is the truth from Goddess, so do not be one of those that doubt
and waver.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.148
And everyone has an ideal for which is the best direction, and for the
performance of good deeds.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Wherever
you may be, Goddess brings the believers together. </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
is the possessor of full power to do these things as is best for
you.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.149
From any place you leave from, turn your face towards any shrine,
church,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">temple
or house of worship, which is special to you, if you desire, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
turn to different directions each time you pray, because Goddess is all
around you.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.150
And for any place you leave, turn your face toward your heartfelt shrine
as you remember Her, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
this is the truth, directly descendent from the Lady of Light, for She
is aware of all that you do for Her.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.151
Just as Mecca is a means for guidance, we have sent the prophetess from
among yourselves,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
be a messenger to you, to purify you and teach you a book of wisdom and
things</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
you previously did not know.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.152
So glorify Goddess so that She may bestow all Her grace upon you </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
teach you the great book of the Korana and wisdom; and teach you things
you never knew before.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.153
The true believers should seek the assistance of Goddess for perfect
patience and prayer,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is with those that persevere patiently.</span>

O my dearest, devoted children, request that your Lady assist you in
prayer and patience, </span>

earth,</span>

angels,</span>

the earth is a dangerous place, and they will be born again as innocent

It is lawful for you during Ramadan to show love to your husband;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
you are a garment to him, and he is a garment to you, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
knows that you have defrauded yourself</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">anytime
you fail to turn to Her for forgiveness after you have erred.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You
should love your spouse freely during the evenings during Ramadan,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
earnestly desire the love that Goddess has provided for you,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
is a comfort to you while you are here on earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">eat
and drink until an hour or two before daybreak when you can
plainly</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">distinguish
between a white and dark thread; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
begin again sometime during the day to fast for no more than ten hours,
if desired; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">otherwise
be in prayer or meditation as much as you are able;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
adopt a pleasant demeanor at all times to others; and love not your
spouse again until sundown.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">These
are the commandments of Your Goddess, who is all loving and wise </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
do not break your covenants with Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Thus,
Goddess declares Her signs to all women, that many can and will come to
love Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
draw closer to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.188
Do not use all of your wealth for vain desires; nor present it to the
unjust, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
they will devour part of it for groundless pursuits, against your own
conscience.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.189
Some people might ask you about the phases of the moon, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you can tell them that the moon determines the best time </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
draw nearer to Goddess and the heavens and when to make a pilgrimage to
sacred sites, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
it is not by the moon that you attain righteousness, it is only by the
love of Goddess that you do.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Some
people have had a custom to make a new doorway in the rear of their
houses </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
they returned from a sacred journey; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
righteousness is not acquired by the way that you enter into a
doorway,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it
is only by the love of Goddess that you gain righteousness.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Therefore,
enter your homes by any door you choose; and love Goddess greatly, that
you may be happy.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.190
Further, you should fight for goodness and love for the religion of
Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
not by physical violence or harm. Never err by attacking someone first;
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess does not care for aggression; She does not appreciate the
aggressor, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet
She loves the peacemaker. Never kill anyone unless it is absolutely
necessary;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
imprison is far better than to physically harm another person.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.191
Temptation to worship the worldly idols of power, greed and wealth is a
great mistake; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
it is clearly greater error to kill someone who worships these instead
of Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Never
fight or commit a violent act in a house of worship;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
if someone attacks you there, you may act reasonably in necessary self
defense,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is the Great Protectress and the Merciful One.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.192
But if anyone refuses to work towards peace, and they attack or threaten
to attack you,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
you are allowed to defend yourselves against imminent harm;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is the Great Protectress, and the Merciful One.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.193
And you are allowed to peacefully evangelize them,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until
their religion is free from the worship of violence, hate, aggression,
oppression and rage.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
if they desist from being hostile, recall that while the unjust will
have no reward,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
will have a great reward, for blessed are the peacemakers.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.194
A sacred month for a sacred month, and blessed are the holy limits of
Mecca,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if
you are attacked therein, defend yourself only as necessary;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it
is wrongful to attack first, but if someone does, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
is with those that love Her and She will know if you did not intend to
harm your sister.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.195
Contribute out of your own wealth to defend your religion of a loving
and Merciful Goddess; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
do not take any action that would unnecessarily put you in harm’s way;
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
do good, for Goddess loves those that do good things.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.196
Perform a holy sacred pilgrimage, to Mecca or another holy site as you
are able, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
look for the visitation of Goddess, and if you are besieged along the
way, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">send
along an offering that is the easiest; and Goddess knows </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
you need not shave your head afterwards,</span><sup><span
style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5<a href="#_ftn57" id="_ftnref57">7</a></span></sup><span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">
for Her mark is upon you and glows in your aura.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
if anyone is sick or ill with fever, these persons may redeem the
shaving of the head, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if
it is desirable, by fasting, alms or another offering, because Goddess
is always pleased by charitable acts.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But,
if you do not find anything to offer, then offer yourself in actions of
kindness and helpfulness to others; acts of charity are more beneficial
to society than mere fasting.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
duty is more important for those that have no family, no sick, elderly
or disabled person with them;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
love Goddess and know that She is quick to forgive you.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.197
A pilgrimage should be performed when it is convenient for your work and
family,</span><sup><span
style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5<a href="#_ftn58" id="_ftnref58">8</a></span></sup><span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;"></span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
during that time you should not make love to another person, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
they are your wedded spouse, or you are both committed in your love to
one another.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You
should avoid mistakes and quarrels with one another while on pilgrimage;
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">instead
focus on loving and helping one another; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
all the good things you do are faithfully recorded and kept by Goddess
and the angels </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in
their book of love, and these deeds are never forgotten, but are
cherished and appreciated greatly.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
best provision you should take with you on pilgrimage is piety and a
pure heart;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
love your Goddess, O people of understanding.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.198
It is never a crime to seek a reasonable profit to sustain yourself and
others and your family,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">should
you engage in commerce while on pilgrimage;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
do not forget that pure greediness is a mistake also.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.199
And should you process from Arafat,</span><sup><span
style="font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">5<a href="#_ftn59" id="_ftnref59">9</a></span></sup><span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">
remember Goddess watches you near the holy monument; and remember Her
directions, although some have erred at that point.</span><sup><span
style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6<a href="#_ftn60" id="_ftnref60">0</a></span></sup><span

</span></span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Therefore,
go in solemn procession and prayer, unless there are young children with
you; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
running and noise is permitted, but not encouraged.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Should
anyone err in this regard, ask Mother Goddess for pardon and She will
pardon, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
She is all loving, kind and forgiving.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.200
And when you have finished your worship, remember Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
you remember your loving mothers before you,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
be even more reverent and loving to those around you, for this pleases
Goddess greatly.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">There
are some people that say, “O Lady of Light, give us wealth and power in
this world,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
not in the next;” but this does not assure one of any wealth in this
life.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.201
Then there are those that say, “O Lady of Light, let us have wealth now
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in
our goodness and kindness to one another today; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
also the same goodness and kindness in the afterlife; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
do not let our lives dwindle into a personal hell of negativity and
despair that we create, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
that burns, worse than hell fire.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.202
All persons shall have a portion of the goodness that She had bestowed
on others less fortunate, during her lifetime. There are some people
that demand their reward during this lifetime,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
this may be false, and there is no assurance that merely demanding a
reward </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall
guarantee it in the after life; others request that they be spared from
hell fire, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">not
knowing there is no such thing and they only create their own soul
torment </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">by
their own mistakes and poor choices.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.203
But those that do good works, shall have a portion of what they have
gained </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in
the name of Goddess; for She is swift and generous in rendering Her
accounting; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
do not forget that Goddess has set forth particular days and tasks for
pilgrimage;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
if one does tarry in the Valley of Mina, or cuts a duty short;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there
is no error in this or any other such action.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
those that linger longer during pilgrimage or other sacrifice to
Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there
shall be no error, for those that love Goddess, and keep Her in their
hearts; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
already know that one day we will all return to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.204
There may be some “prophetesses” in life that cause you to marvel by
their speech </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">concerning
this present life; one has called upon Goddess to bear witness to her
good heart; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet
she was only intent upon opposing our blessed prophetess and she
promoted hate, aggression and fear.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.205
When she turned away from the prophetess, she quickly began to act
corruptly and unjustly, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
she tried to destroy what beauty had been planted, and what had begun to
sprout; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess anguishes over such erroneous actions.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.206
And when she was told to love Goddess and choose only goodness and
light; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">her
own pride and ego seized her because she would not believe this;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
she will only find unhappiness and grief on the day of her resurrection,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
an unhappy couch it will be.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.207
There is also a woman who exchanged her comfortable life </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
a life of hard work and sacrifice to Goddess, which was most pleasing to
Goddess,</span><sup><span

</span>

<span style="font-size:

know that Goddess is gracious and bountiful in returning goodness to her
Children of Light.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.208
O true believers, enter into a religion of goodness and light
completely,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
follow not darkness and negativity; for this is your avowed
enemy.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.209
If you have slipped in the covenants of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
understands, and is mighty and wise and knows what you keep in your
heart.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.210
Certainly the unbelievers do not believe that Goddess will come to them
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from
within the clouds and cut through their darkness and negativity when
requested, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
She does for the angels who adore Her; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
She has decreed the specific plan that all Her children would return to
Her one day.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.211
Ask the children of Israel how many signs of Goddess were shown to them;
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
there is no one that can change the grace of Goddess after it has come
to them; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
know that Goddess is severe and strong in Her love for all Her
children.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.212
Though the present life is made beautiful and wondrous for all,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
unbelievers scoff at it and the faithful to Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
those who love Goddess are above all else are true believers,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they will be so very joyous on their day of resurrection;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is abundant with Her blessings, without measure.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.213
For at one time humanity was all of one faith, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess has sent many prophetesses out bearing good tidings, and She has
denounced the darkness, and She lovingly sent down her prophetesses,
angels, and ascended mistresses bearing Scriptures in truth, that women
might learn and be wise and make good choices; the only people making
poor choices</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">are
those that do not believe that Goddess loves them always,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they ignore true meaning of the Scriptures, out of their envy and love
for their own ego.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
Goddess has directed that those who believe and do good works love Her,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Her
truth was evident to those that had formerly disagreed, by Her will;
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess directs all to the right path, although only some will
follow.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.214
You should understand that all true believers will enter paradise,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
though this has not been revealed to you before, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
this has happened to your ancestors before you.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Many
before you suffered hardships and difficulties and sickness,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so
that your prophetesses and ascended mistresses would come to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you would then believe them and become closer to Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
in fact you asked, “When will help come from Goddess?”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Is
the help of Goddess near to us?” But they were right before you, living
with you, both then and now.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.215
They ask who should receive alms and you should reply, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Let
it be given to parents, kindred, orphans, the poor and the
stranger;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those
unjustly imprisoned, and those in need, those that are refugees,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
for all the good things you do because Goddess knows and
remembers.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.216
War is prohibited, but you and those you think are your enemies
earnestly desire it, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nonetheless,
you must refrain from it, except when in self defense; and even then,
always attempt peace,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
only defend yourselves to the extent necessary to what you need.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
is the case, even though this is difficult for you; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">at
first you will hate it, but then you will grow to understand it;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess knows this even though you do not know it yet.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.217
Some may ask you whether it is permissible to make war during a holy
month, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">holy
week or holy day; and you must answer, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“To
make war is a great mistake, yet it is even a greater mistake not to
defend oneself, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
to defend an oppressed people, or to defend a place of worship, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
to defend those who would be unjustly driven from their homes, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
it creates in the people a temptation to worship the negative earthly
idols of wealth, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">power
and greed and not Goddess, who loves and adores you all.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Many
will not cease to fight you until you turn from your religion</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
from Goddess if they are able to convince you of this; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
if you turn from Goddess and then become corrupt and unjust, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
heart will become hardened and all your life will have been in vain in
this world and in the next,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
on the day of your resurrection, your soul will grieve for such a
loss,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
you could have done so much good here on earth, with guidance from
Goddess; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.218
But those who believe and defend others and keep the peace or make
peace,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
do so in the name of Goddess, they shall have abundant mercy and love
from Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:

Goddess is loving and gracious.</span>

such as gambling, recreational drugs and alcohol,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you should answer that it is not the vice that is the issue,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
whether it hurts anyone else that depends upon you,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
there are many who depend upon your in your lifetime.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
avoid anything that is illegal, and anything that is addictive to
you.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">What
is left is something that does not hurt others, and is done in a
moderate fashion.</span>

You may also be asked concerning orphans and children,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you should answer that to deal righteously with them is best;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
if you become their financial guardian, do not steal from them in any
manner for your own </span>

<span

another’s benefit, for they are your children also and Goddess knows
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
corrupt dealer from the righteous; and you will find great distress on
the day of your resurrection </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
unjust dealing; for this is the plan of Goddess; for She is almighty and
wise.</span>

do not encourage any woman to love such a man, unless and until he
becomes kind and loving, </span>

Some men may ask regarding women’s menstruation, </span>

<span style="font-size:

is merciful and will allow them release if this is a burden, from an
unhappy marriage.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.227
Those that divorce, both women and men, should wait at least three
months before dating again;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if
a woman is pregnant by her former husband, it is generally best for her
to inform him accordingly, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if
he is not abusive to her,</span><sup><span

style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">
and the couple may consider reconciling for the sake of the
child,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
this would be best, but if this is not possible; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
through prayer and meditation Goddess will relieve them of this
burden.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.228
Women should behave toward their husbands in a kindly, patient
manner,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
their husbands should behave toward them, according to the same;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
no partner should have superiority over the other, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
the two should work as a team for two have been joined as one in
marriage.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.229
For Goddess is almighty and wise. You may divorce your spouse once,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
after that it is best to seek a period of professional counseling prior
to a second divorce; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
you and your spouse are parted through divorce, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
should treat your ex-spouse humanely and with all kindness and
respect.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It
is not right, upon divorce, to take back any gifts you have given a
spouse during the marriage, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
it becomes necessary to liquidate an item or thing to provide
necessaries </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
children or a disabled or elderly person dependent on one of the
parties,</span><sup><span

style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;"></span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
this should never be used as a means to hurt a former spouse.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.230
It should not be right for any spouse to require that the other pay an
amount </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">from
the property that she or he brought to the marriage as a precursor to
divorce.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">These
are the commandments of Goddess and you should keep them faithfully
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
become and remain closer to Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.231
But when you are both divorced, if either party desires to contact the
other, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
should be done on the basis of mutual consent and with kindness,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
neither party should prevent or take any action to obstruct the
remarriage of the other party.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
this is one of the commandments of Goddess; She declares them to Her
understanding children.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
is given as a direction to all people that love Goddess </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
believe in the day of their resurrection and Paradise;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.232
It matters not how many times a person is involved with a
divorce;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">each
time, proper professional counseling should be sought,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
well as prayer and meditation prior to any divorce or any
remarriage.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It
is never an issue to remarry a former spouse, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
long as professional counseling is sought prior to any remarriage,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">especially
if the couple can observe the commandments of Goddess and are committed
to Her.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.233
Generally, mothers should nurse a child for at least two years after
birth,</span><sup><span
style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6<a href="#_ftn67" id="_ftnref67">7</a></span></sup><span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;"></span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
even thereafter, as the mother decides, yet both are liable to the child
for food, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">clothing,
necessaries, and an education, according to the abilities of the
parents.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
no child should receive less or more of these items due to her
gender.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">A
mother shall not be compelled to do what is unreasonable on account of
her child, nor should the father.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
any heir of the parents is not obligated in a like manner,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
is, to do what is unreasonable or what simply cannot be done; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
parents that chose to wean an infant prior to two years of age,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">upon
the mother’s request, or upon mutual consideration, there is no mistake
in this.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
those that hire a nurse or a nanny for the child, there is no error in
this, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
long as you pay the nanny fairly and at the rate which you have promised
her, according to what is just;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
love Goddess and know that Goddess sees all that you do.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.234
Should any person divorce or die and leave a spouse, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
the spouse should wait at least four months before remarrying, if
possible;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
there is no true error in any earlier remarriage; provided that the new
couple is ready;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">only
Goddess knows what is in your hearts.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.235
And it is not error to make public overtures of love or marriage to any
suitable unmarried person; but wait a reasonable mourning period or four
months in the case of death of a spouse;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It
matters not whether you keep such desires in your own mind; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
knows you will later remember them.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
make no promises to a beloved privately, unless you speak the honorable
truth regarding your love;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
wait a reasonable period before marriage, whenever possible;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
know that Goddess knows what is in your minds,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
be careful, but know that Goddess is all gracious and merciful.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.236
It is not acceptable to attain an annulment </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">purely
for the reason that you have not coupled with your spouse, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor
have you obtained shared assets in both your names;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">rather,
seek professional counseling, prayer and a reasonable period of time
prior to annulment, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
annul the marriage then only if you do not love them and cannot get
along with them.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.237
Always provide for an ex-spouse that is indigent, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">according
to your abilities to provide such support; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
if you are indigent yourself also, then from that what you can share;
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
is a duty incumbent on the righteous.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">If
you divorce a spouse that you have not touched, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you have accepted any property from them or purchased jointly held
property,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
should nonetheless give them back any property they gave you,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">unless
it was a gift, and you should split equally any jointly held
property;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
if you give them back all they gave you and half of all jointly held
property, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
will nearer approach piety. </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
strive to be liberal regarding others, for Goddess loves the person who
is nonjudgmental in all things.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.238
Carefully observe your daily prayers, in the morning and in the
evening,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
be assiduous with devotion clearly directed toward Goddess.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.239
But if you face danger, pray while on foot or horseback, or wherever you
are,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">no
matter what you are doing or not doing, Goddess always hears and listens
to your prayers.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.240
And if you die, your will should provide adequately for your spouse and
your dependent children,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
if your finances are limited, you should make provisions for them to the
extent that you can,</span><sup><span

mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">6<a href="#_ftn68" id="_ftnref68">8</a></span></sup><span

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
leave at least a life tenancy for your spouse in your main residence,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
joint tenancy is preferable, together with a minimum of one third of
your estate, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
if your spouse should leave your house and give it to your children
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
other dependent prior to the expiry of her life tenancy, that is also
acceptable; for Goddess is all wise.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.241
For those that are divorced, a reasonable provision to an indigent
former spouse is directed, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess directs kindness to others always.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.242
Goddess has directed many signs to you; that you may understand and
learn.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.243
You should consider the assembly of the Children of Israel, after the
time of Sarah and Miriam; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
those people were near death; and then they wandered in the wilderness
for forty years.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Then,
from the next generation, She revived them and they inherited the
promised land.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
is benevolent to Her people, but most do not give Her any
thanks.</span><sup><span

Fight the good nonviolent fight in words and deeds and actions of grace
in the name of Goddess </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
know that She hears and knows and remembers all of what you do for
Her.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.245
You should consider that to lend one’s life to Goddess</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">bears
one an excellent interest rate or rate of return on investment,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
when you do good deeds in the name of Goddess, </span>

<span

return will be greatly increased many times over.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.246
You should consider the high priestess of the children of Israel,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">during
the time of Miriam, when they said to their prophetess,</span>

for us a Queen that we may evangelize others to the true religion of
Goddess.”</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
prophetess answered, “If you are willing to engage in a struggle</span>

<span

good religion, then are you prepared for the hardship involved?”</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
the people answered, “There is nothing holding us back that we
should</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">not

But when many actually had to engage in a great strenuous mission to
improve society and religion, many did not have the stamina that they
thought they did;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they turned their back on this promise, except for a few,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess was pleased to see a few strong souls that would endure such a
long mission on Her account.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
their prophetess said to them, Goddess has sent you a Queen Taluta

many are more worthy of this queendom than she, nor does she possess
great riches?”</span>

<span

said “Goddess has chosen her to rule over you </span>

<span

has provided her with great knowledge, wisdom and stature,</span>

<span

Goddess gives Her Queendom to those which She knows best to rule;

Goddess is courteous, kind and wise.”</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.248
And the prophetess further related, “And the sign of Her Queendom shall
be on an ark </span>

you shall find sacred relics</span><sup><span style="font-size:12.0pt;

the family of Mother Mary, and the angels shall bring them to
you.”</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">All
of this should be a sign to you, if you believe.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.249
And when Queen Taluta departed with the peacekeepers on a mission of
evangelization, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she
said, “To show your faith in Goddess, go down by the river and watch,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those
that drink of the river will not be on my side, and those that do not
drink of the river,</span>

<span

be on my side, except those that only drink from their hands.”</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
they all drank from the river, except for a very few.</span><sup><span

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
when they had passed the river, Queen Taluta and those who believed with
her said, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“We
have no strength today, to evangelize against the </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">forces
of darkness and negativity of Jalut or Goliath.”</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.250
But those who remembered that they would meet Goddess on the day of
their resurrection said, “Remember that many times even a small group of
missionaries can evangelize multitudes, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">by
the will of Goddess; She is with those who patiently and kindly
persevere.”</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
when they went forth to evangelize Jalut and his people, they
said,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“O
Lady of Light, pour on us patience and kindness and confirm our beliefs,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
help us against those that would harm us and live a life of war and are
not for peace or Goddess.”</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.251
Thereafter, Dana,</span><sup><span

style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">
a mere shepardess, then slew Goliath, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess gave her a queendom and wisdom and great
knowledge,</span><sup><span

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess showed humanity that a battle only between two people</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">is
much preferred to save the lives of many, and to prevent the corruption
of the people </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
love war and not Goddess, thereby creating earthly idols of hate, war
and violence.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.252
These are the signs of Goddess; you have been shown this is the truth,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
surely these were signs sent out only by Her.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.253
There are many prophetesses sent by Goddess, there will be many more to
come;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
angels do not prefer some over others; some Goddess has spoken to
directly </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you may want to exalt some over the others; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
the angels and Goddess do not do this; they consider all good entities
to be wonderful.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">We
gave to Yeshua and Mother Mary obvious signs and strengthened them both
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with
the Holy Spirit of Goddess. And if Goddess had desired so,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">those
who came after the prophetesses would not have turned from Goddess,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">after
seeing multiple signs shown to them.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
they fell into disagreements over minutiae of theology and
ritual,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
some came to lose faith; but if Goddess could have shown them that peace
and harmony I</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">n
all things is preferred, then they would not have quarreled, but many
people do what they want.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.254
A true believer will give alms freely, before the day comes wherein
there will be no commerce, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">nor
friendships, nor family intercession; you will have only the good will
purchased from Goddess </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
you acquired during your lifetime.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.255
Those that have no faith in Goddess or kindness have a darkness within
their souls. </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess!
There is no Goddess but She, the living, the self-sustaining;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
needs neither dreams nor sleep, and to Her belongs everythin in the
heavens and on earth.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">None
can change what Goddess will do, except through petition and prayer and
Her infinite mercy,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
is always bestowed freely upon you all.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For
Goddess knows all the past, the present and the future,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
no person has such knowledge, except as it is granted unto her by the
grace of Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Who
is most gracious, generous and kind.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For
the throne of Goddess extends over all the heaven and earth, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
the maintenance of both is no burden to Her and Her angels; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
She is the High One and the Almighty One. </span>

she shall have a strong heart, which will not be broken; for Goddess
hears and sees all.</span>

<span

Goddess is the Patroness of all who believe;</span>

shall lead Her children out of the darkness and into the light;</span>

as to those who do not believe in Her, their patrons are Evil or
darkness and negativity,</span>

<span

they will remain in the state of darkness and dankness until their
hearts are changed.</span>

When Sarah said, “it is only by my Goddess who gives or takes away life
that I find love,” </span>

<span

if you are greater than Her, now bring it up from the west.”</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Whereupon,
the persecutor became confused and confounded,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess will not assist a violent religious persecutor.</span>

Or consider the behavior of a certain woman</span><sup><span

named Esma</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
passed a city that had been destroyed to its foundations.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
woman said, “How could Goddess possibly bring this city back to life?”
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Just
then, Goddess caused the woman to sleep for one hundred years, as if she
were dead, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
then she came back to life. And Goddess asked the woman, </span>

how long do you think you have been here?” </span>

the woman replied, “A day, or part of a day.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
said, “No, you have been here a hundred years.”</span>

<span style="font-size:

at your food and your wine, they are still fresh and delectable.”</span>

<span style="font-size:

now gaze upon your poor donkey, she was all bones before I brought her
back to life just for you.” When this was all shown to Esma, she said,
“I know that Goddess is able to do anything.”</span>

raise the dead,” </span>

Goddess replied, “Do you not believe that I can do such a
thing?”</span><sup><span

answered, “Yes, I do, but please show me so that my mind will be put at
ease.” </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
told her to then take four dead birds and divide them and lay a piece on
every mountain, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
she could just call them, and they would arrive swiftly to her, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
then she would know that Goddess is almighty and wise.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
Sarah did as she was told, and all the birds immediately returned to her
alive.</span>

The synergy of those that lay out their wealth and capabilities for
Goddess, </span>

<span

in the advancement of the true religion of Goddess for love and kindness
to all </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">is
like a grain of corn that produces seven ears of corn, and in every ear
a hundred grains; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess gives many times over Her bounty to those that give to Her by
doing good things;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess

taught them,</span>

<span

afterwards no longer follow the negative idols that they had worshiped
before, </span>

<span

despite the fact they suffered reproaches or mischief at the hands of
others, </span>

shall have their abundant reward with the Lady of Light,</span>

A fair speech and forgiveness for all is better than alms followed by
mischief,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is wealthy and powerful in spirit.</span>

Please, believers, do not make your alms ineffective by judgment or
mischief, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
she who gives only to show off to others, and who does not truly believe
in charity or in Goddess,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.265
the likeness of such a person is like a match covered with dirt, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">upon
which a drenching rain has fallen, and leaves it soggy and
worthless.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
do not truly prosper in any of their endeavors, for Goddess does
not</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">direct
souls that do not want Her to come to them.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.266
If you all desire to have a garden of palm trees and grape vines through
which clear rivers flow, wherein you may have all kinds of fruits, and
may attain an advanced age, then you must pray, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
without Her you may attain only sickly children, and multiple severe
storms </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with
plague after plague following thereafter, and your life will be burdened
and without direction.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Thus,
Goddess shows Her signs to you, that you might ponder and
understand.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.267
All true believers, bestow alms out of the good you have gained only by
the grace of Goddess, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
from the bounty of the earth, which is Hers, and thus do not choose
darkness and negativity, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so
give freely in alms, such that you would desire to receive yourselves,
should you ever be in need; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">otherwise
alms become but a contrivance; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
should know that Goddess is exceedingly wealthy and worthy of all your
praise.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.268
Those that are dark and negative threaten you with poverty,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
entice you with nasty greediness; but Goddess promises refuge from all
this </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">together
with Her forgiveness and abundance; for Goddess is bounteous and
wise.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.269
She will give wisdom to all that seek it from Her, and for those that
receive Her wisdom, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there
is great goodness, but none will receive this, except the wise and kind
of heart that believe in Her.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.270
And whatever alms you give, and the promises you make;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
knows all of this; but those who act unjustly and will not believe will
have no Protectress.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.271
If you make your charitable acts known, that is well; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
if you conceal them and still give to the poor, this is better for
you;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you will gather much good will about you;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess knows well of all you do and She will be very pleased.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.272
You will not know what direction your life will take;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess knows all about your direction in life. </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
good deeds that you give in charity to others less fortunate will be
multiplied upon yourself; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you should not give except from a sincere and loving heart and in honor
of Goddess.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.273
And the goodness you give in alms shall be repaid many times over back
to you; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
shall not be treated unjustly; for the poor that are wholly engaged
</span>

<span

endeavoring to maintain a loving religion of Goddess do well;<span

</span></span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet
many cannot travel freely; there are those who know that true wealth
lies in modest attire, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they are blessed, you shall know them by their mark of kindness, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
they do not command women regarding what they should wear; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess will know all the good you do when you give alms.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.274
People who distribute alms from their own property by day and
night,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in
public and in private, shall have their reward from the Lady of
Light;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">no
fear shall come to them, nor shall they grieve.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.275
Those that promote usury and charge clearly excessive fees to lend
money,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall
be most grieved on the day of their resurrection, for all the harm they
caused others, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
darkness has infected them with an evil touch, this will happen to those
that make the excuse, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Usury
is the same as selling merchandise for a large profit,”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
yet Goddess does not permit selling for unreasonable profits either,
especially to the poor and needy, nor does She permit the lending of
money for large profits to the poor and needy.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
those that continue excessive usury after hearing Her Word, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall
indeed be saddened on the day of their resurrection, when they see the
troubles they have caused.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.276
Nonetheless, Goddess cannot give blessings to you from your usury,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
She will allow others to receive the blessings and increase alms;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">still,
Goddess does not understand the avarice inherent in the
unbelievers.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.277
O true believers, love Goddess, and abandon usury and unreasonable
profits, if you really believe; but if you do not, know that a battle
rages within yourself, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess is within you and your ego will fight with Her, until She
changes you into the light.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.278
However, if you change and repent usury and unreasonable profits,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
Goddess will forgive you, and you will have all your money back and an
even higher profit.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.279
If you do not deal unjustly with others, then you will not suffer
unjustness yourself.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.280
If you have a debtor with difficulty in paying you, then give the debtor
extra time to pay, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
it would clearly be best for you to simply forgive the debt
entirely,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">if
only you knew what Goddess and the angels already know.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.281
And love the day that you will see the face of Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
every soul will be paid according to what she or he has gained; and you
will not be treated unjustly.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.282
O true believers, when you incur a debt over a period of time, write it
down, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
let the writer and the parties write down just and fair repayment terms;
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
do not allow the writer to propound any injustice that Goddess has not
taught; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
let the writer write freely, and let the debtor dictate the terms,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
let the debtor’s terms be fair, out of her love for Goddess and
truth.<span
style="mso-tab-count:1">                                        
</span></span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
if the debtor is incapacitated, weak or disabled, let his
agent</span><sup><span
style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">8<a href="#_ftn82" id="_ftnref82">2</a></span></sup><span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">
do so in equity; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
call two witnesses or female neighbors; but if there are not two women,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
a man and a woman will do; if one should make a mistake, then the other
can refresh his recollection.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
the witnesses should not refuse, when they are called; whether it is a
large or small debt or contract; </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
do not wait until the time to collect or to perform your contractual
obligations to do this; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
there is a greater chance for quarrels and misunderstandings among
you.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For
this method is better in the sight of Goddess, and for the witnesses,
and more easy, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">such
that doubts will not be increased among you.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
if it is a present transaction between those you know well and
trust,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it
is not clearly a mistake to fail to write it down.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
take witnesses with you, whenever possible, when you sell to one
another, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
let no harm come to the witnesses or any lawyer, which if you do, is
your mistake,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
if you love Goddess, She will instruct you properly, for Goddess knows
all things.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.283
And if you are on a journey, and a scribe or lawyer is not available to
you,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
you cannot write out a contract, you may simply agree between
yourselves, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
if one of you trusts the other, then let she who is trustworthy retain
what she was trusted with, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">out
of your love for Goddess. And do not conceal any testimony, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
this breeds injustice and darkness of the heart; Goddess knows what you
do;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">2.284
Whatever is in heaven and on earth belongs to Goddess, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
whether you make known what is in your mind, or whether you conceal it,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
will call you to account for it, and She will forgive all who ask,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
She will devise plans to correct those that do not, for Goddess is
merciful and almighty.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">

Light, </span>

<span

<span style="font-size:

She has sent down the book of the Korana full of truth, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.4
confirming that which was revealed before;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
She had lovingly sent down her Law and Her Gospels as a direction to all
humanity,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
She has given Her direction between good and evil.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
those that do not believe in the signs of Goddess</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">shall
be deeply saddened on the day of their resurrection </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
all the good they might have accomplished with Her help;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
rest assured that Goddess has no need for revenge against anyone, She is
pure Love.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.5
Nothing on earth can ever be hidden from Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.6
for She Herself formed you lovingly in your mother’s uterus, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
She was most happy to do this for you; there is no Goddess but She, the
mighty and the wise.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.7
It is She who has sent this Book to you, where some verses will be
obvious and clear to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">while
others are told in parable form. Those that have a dark heart and are
full of negativity will</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">interpret
these parables darkly and with great pessimism,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they will create schism and doubt, yet none will know the true
interpretation </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">except
Goddess and Her angels and the believers who are liberal and full of
love in their interpretations.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Those
persons that have great knowledge will say, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">we
believe that all this Scripture is from the Lady of Light; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
none will consider and ponder this well, except those that are
prudent.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.8
O Lady of Light, do not allow our hearts to swerve away from Your
truths,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
You have set them forth, and after You have directed us;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
we ask for Your mercy as You are generous and abundant in mercy.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.9
O Lady of Light, we believe You will provide us</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with
a day of resurrection at our death, and clear direction at that
time;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">there
is no doubt in this, for you have promised it, and Goddess is never
contrary to Her promises.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.10
As for those that do not desire Goddess at this time; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">their
wealth is not a true profit, nor can their children intercede for
them;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">their
souls will continue to suffer torment and wander aimlessly on the earth
until they turn to Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
torment shall feel as though they were serving as fuel for hell
fire.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.11
Some of the people of Pharaoh, and some of their ancestors had told
others that this religion is a lie;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess knew their wickedness and was saddened,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
She devised plans to lead them back to the correct path</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">through
trials and tribulations; for Goddess does not punish.<span

Tell others that do not believe that they are lost and without a
protectress;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
their lives are like hell fire until they ask for guidance from Goddess
and the angels; </span>

they will have an unnecessarily unhappy couch to sleep upon.</span>

<span style="font-size:

<span style="font-size:

the knowledge of unity was brought forth, some people departed, </span>

<span style="font-size:

only out of expediency or jealousy; but those who do not believe in the
signs of Goddess </span>

find their accounting poor for all the good they might have done,

<span style="font-size:

believed in Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:

If anyone disputes this, then say, “I have resigned myself to
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:

She who follows goodness and light does likewise;”</span>

<span style="font-size:

you profess the religion of Mother Goddess?”</span>

if they embrace Her religion, then they are rightly directed;</span>

if they turn their backs on Her, then they have learned vain preaching
only,</span>

Goddess knows and regards Her servants greatly.</span>

they slay prophetesses without just cause, </span>

<span style="font-size:

put women to death that have done nothing wrong and only teach justice,
peace and love;</span>

<span style="font-size:

will have a most grievous soul suffering experience on the day of their
resurrection </span>

<span style="font-size:

others.</span>

failings.</span>

All of womenkind have been called to the good book of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:

understand that judgment is to be tempered with mercy, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.24
This they did because they believed in hell fire and thought that it
would only touch them </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
a certain number of days; but this is a false deception on their part;
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess does not make or use hell fire on anyone; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
has far more sophisticated methods of discipline,</span>

is pure love and does not harm any soul. It is safe to trust in
Her.</span>

resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:

souls that have made mistakes will see their mistakes clearly,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
many will suffer soul grief for the wrong they have done, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
those that have gained will ascend higher and closer to Goddess, but no
soul will be treated unjustly.</span>

Tell us, O Goddess who possesses the Queendom?</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">You
bring into Your Queendom only those that desire to enter therein;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
many souls desire some work to make them ascend closer to You, </span>

others tarry into mistakes and falsehoods and their souls fall further
from You;</span>

the hands of Goddess bear only goodness, for Goddess is almighty.</span>

<span style="font-size:

Goddess made the night to follow the day;</span>

<span style="font-size:

She provides food for all Her beloved children in abundance.</span>

And any believer should be very cautious if she selects a dark entity
for a friend,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">she
must carefully guard against evil, and not be tempted to do evil
herself. </span>

now cautions you regarding this.</span>

<span style="font-size:

Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
makes no difference to Goddess, for She knows all and knows what is
exactly in your hearts, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess

On your last day, the day of your resurrection, </span>

error;</span>

<span style="font-size:

will then have true hope to be as close as possible to Goddess and Her
angels;</span>

<span style="font-size:

Thus, the Lady of Light accepted Mary with a gracious
acceptance</span><sup><span

caused her to bear superior and loving and kind offspring.</span>

Anna took care of the child, but when Anna and her sister Elizabeth went

saw her daughter had luscious fruits with her. She asked her, “Mary,
where did this fruit come from?” </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Mary
replied, “These are from Goddess and Her angels, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess loves me and is very pleased with me.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.38
Then Elizabeth called upon the Lady of Light and said, “O Lady of
Light,</span>

<span style="font-size:

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.39
And the angels called to her and her husband during their prayers
</span>

<span style="font-size:

said, “Goddess has promised you a daughter and</span>

Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.40
Elizabeth said, “Lady of Light, how could I possibly have a
daughter</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
I am so old and my husband has not been able to love me for
years?”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
angel replied, “Goddess can do anything for you.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.41
Zacharias then requested, “Lady of Light, please give me a sign this is
true,”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Zacharias was a doubter. The angel replied, “The sign will be </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
you will not be able to speak for three days and you will have to
gesture; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">remember
the Lady of Light often and praise Her evening and morning, as you are
able.” </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.42
The angels also told Mary, “Goddess has chosen you for a holy purpose
and </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She

Her and bow down.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.44
This is a secret herstory, and it is only revealed to your prophetess,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
your prophetess was not present with them when the priestesses threw in
their rods to cast lots</span>

to which one of them would have the education of Mary,</span><sup><span

was your prophetess with them when they discussed this between
themselves.</span>

<span style="font-size:

When the angels said to Mary, “Goddess has sent you good tidings,</span>

she replied, “O Lady of Light, how could I possibly have a son since a
man has not touched me?”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.48
The angel responded, “Goddess creates according to Her plan;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
when She decrees something, whatever it is, it will come to pass; She
only says, ‘Be!’ And it is!”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.49
Goddess teaches Her prophetesses the Scriptures, the wisdom and the Law

Goddess appoints these as mistresses over the world, and over the
Children of Israel.</span>

then the child Yeshua shall say, “I come to you with signs</span>

11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
said “live!” and then she lived.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.60
This is the truth from Goddess; do not be one of those that
doubt.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.61
Anyone that will dispute this with you concerning Yeshua,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">after
the knowledge that has been given to you, tell them,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Come,
let us call together our daughters and your daughters and</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">our
husbands and your husbands and ourselves and yourselves</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
let us beg of those who make improper implications and let</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
devise plans to set straight those that do not understand.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.62
Certainly, this is a true herstory; and there is no divine ruler but
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess is mighty and wise. </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.63
Those that repent and become righteous will be forgiven by
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.64
Tell those that have received the Scriptures, that we have all come to
justice,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
we all truly worship no goddess except Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
we associate no negative emotions or actions with Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
if anyone turns back, say to Goddess, “You are witness that we are true
believers.” </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.65
If you have been given the Scriptures, then do not dispute what Sarah
taught you, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">since
you are now allowed more information from Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
we have advanced and perfected more.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.66
Try to understand it makes little sense to dispute things you have
limited knowledge about,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">however;
it makes no sense to dispute things that you know nothing about.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
knows everything, but you all do not.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.67
Sarah was neither a Jew or a Christian; but she did follow a true and
good and kind religion, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">one
that was based on Goddess worship and not on worship of earthly idols
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">of
wealth, greed, self centeredness and power. </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.68
Certainly those who are close to Sarah in kindred spirit</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">are
those that follow her and her true and good and kind religion, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
also the prophetesses who came after her are blessed; Goddess is
patroness of the faithful.</span>

Some people who have received the Scriptures may try to seduce you

they do not perceive this as being the case.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.70
If you have received the Scriptures, you should believe in the signs of
Goddess; </span>

you are witness to them.</span>

<span style="font-size:

If you have received the Scriptures, then you should not clothe truth
with vain desires, </span>

<span style="font-size:

must you knowingly hide the truth.</span>

<span style="font-size:

And some of you who have received the Scriptures </span>

11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">believe
in what has been sent down for the believers in the beginning of the
day, </span>

and they lose their faith, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
in doing so they follow a different religion, not one of love, peace or
kindness.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.73
Tell others that the true direction to pray is the direction of
Goddess</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
know that She is within you and all around you, and this is given to you
as a wonderful revelation,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
She is well pleased to relieve any excessive religious duties and make
Her religion a blessing upon you.</span>

<span style="font-size:

Tell them that “Everything excellent lies in the hands of Goddess,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
She gives it to those loyal to Her, Goddess is bounteous and wise; She
gives mercy to her followers;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
is imbued with abundant benevolence.</span>

<span style="font-size:

them with a talent, </span>

<span style="font-size:

will not pay it back until you hound them with great

<span style="font-size:

Their excuse is that they are not obliged to be just with a “heathen,”
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
this is a falsehood against Goddess, for we are all Her children,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
we are commanded to do no injustice to any person, so as to be an
example and a light to the world.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Those
that keep the covenants of Goddess and love Goddess, She will love them
greatly and bless them.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.77
But those who must be paid extra to keep their agreements, contracts and
oaths to others, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
those that sell out on their agreements, contracts and oaths to others
for a small price, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">darken
their hearts and souls and reduce their advancement in the next world;
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">further
they shall not see Goddess on the day of their resurrection, unless they
repent and turn to Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
even if they do not repent, Goddess will devise plans for them to set
them straight.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.78
Then there are also those that read the Scripture perversely and
darkly,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with
negativity and sourness in their hearts, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
try to convince you that there is a darkness in the Scriptures that you
should follow;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
clearly it is not there and it is only in their own fearful
minds,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so
then they speak falsely regarding Goddess; but all of this is not from
Her, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
She is only peace and love and harmony; and only this was written in
their own<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">  </span>hearts.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.79
It is not appropriate for any person to be given revelations from
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Her wisdom and prophecy, and then the person should tell others</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Worship
me and not Goddess,” but what that person ought to say is,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Be
good in your knowledge and works since you know the Scriptures, and
exercise kindness to all.</span><sup><span

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.80
Goddess does not tell you to take the angels and prophetesses as
goddesses instead of Her, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
you should be thankful to them for all they do and remember them in your
prayers to Her, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
this is what a true believer does.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.81
When Goddess accepts a covenant or agreement with the prophetesses,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
says “This is the Scripture and wisdom that I have given to you;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">more
apostles and prophetesses will come, confirming true Scripture</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
revealing even more from Goddess than what you have now, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you should believe in what they say and assist them.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
has asked many if they would accept Her covenants and agreements</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
many have agreed to do so, out of love for Her.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.82
Those that agree to the covenants and agreements with Goddess are firmly
resolved,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">with
Her assistance, and thus they become witnesses to their Lady of
Light,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they are unlikely to turn back and become unbelievers.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.83
Thus, there is no reason to seek anything other than the true religion
of Goddess</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
teaches love, kindness and charity, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
She controls everything in heaven and on earth and to Her you shall all
return.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.84
Tell others that you believe in Goddess, and in Sarah, Isabell, Iris and
Jacklyn and their good children, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
in that which was given to Miriam and Mother Mary and Yeshua, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
all the other ascended mistresses and masters, from their Lady of Light.
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
angels make no distinction among any of them, and we are dedicated to
our Goddess.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.85
Whoever follows any other untrue religion, that is, one that teaches
darkness and negativity, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
is completely unacceptable, they are likely to darken their hearts,
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">refuse
Goddess on the day of their resurrection, act corruptly and
unjustly,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they will not enter Paradise on the day of their resurrection, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
they will suffer soul grief instead, until they repent and turn to Her;
</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet
no one shall perish for Goddess does not destroy souls.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.86
Know that Goddess does not further direct those that do not love
Her,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
do not believe in Her anymore, including those that once believed in Her
and Her Holy Women, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">good
works and prophetesses.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
will no longer be guided in the differences between right and
wrong.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.87
They shall not see Paradise in the next life, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
shall suffer sadness when they see what they have done on their day of
judgment.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.88
And they shall continue to be reborn upon the earth, never seeing
paradise,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">until
they repent and turn to Her.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.89
But those who repent and turn to Goddess and ask forgiveness for their
errors and mistakes,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
will see Paradise; for She is the Most Forgiving and Most Merciful
one.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.90
As for the others, Goddess and the angels will devise plans to set them
on the right path,</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">lovingly
and kindly, for Goddess is all love, grace and mercy.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Those
who do not believe after they once believed, will be gently urged back
to the right path to Goddess. </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.91
Those who die in unbelief, can still seek Goddess, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
She will love them and welcome them into Paradise, if they will only ask
for Her;</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
not even mountains of gold will not be accepted for ransom if they deny
Her, </span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they shall see how their unbelief did not allow them to reach out in

All food was permitted to the Children of Israel, but they forbade

you return to corruption and injustice after you believed?” Then you

She will cleanse them of their sins and errors and fill them up again

already have peace and joy,</span>

they are likely to suffer indignation and poverty of the soul of their

knew it and She also knows those that become faint hearted, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
do not hesitate to pray to Her for strength and courage,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
She supports all that believe in Her, and let the faithful trust in
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.123
And Goddess has given you many victories each day against the dark
side,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
though you are fewer in number;<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span></span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">therefore
love Goddess, that you may be completely thankful to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.124
You should note that some do not remember the times </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
Goddess sent down three thousand angels to help you love one
another</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
to keep peace amongst the warmongering nations.</span><sup><span

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.125
Assuredly, if you persevere, and love Goddess, and darkness and
negativity come upon you suddenly, your Lady of Light will assist you
with five thousand angels,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">distinguished
by their horses and attire, you shall know them.</span><sup><span

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.126
And this Goddess does as good tidings to you, that your hearts may rest
assured,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
victory in life comes only from Goddess, for She is the Almighty and
Wizened One.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.127
For She does not help the person that does not want Her, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
the person that does not believe in Her, they may be cut down by
darkness and evil, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
that they may be overthrown and unsuccessfully endeavor in fruitless
pursuits, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">while
it grieves Her heart if one of Her precious children is hurt, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
will generally not assist unless assistance is previously requested of
Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.128
And if you would be helpful, you would pray to restrain those who are
the darker entities,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
keep them from doing evil on the earth and from harming others, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
She does not punish any soul necessarily, even the unjust and corrupt,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
She devises plans and strategies for them to turn back to Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.129
To Goddess belongs whatever is in heaven and upon the earth;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">She
helps all who ask, and She punishes no one, for darkness abounds only on
earth and not in heaven, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
to understand all this in and of itself is a test or difficulty for Her
children.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.130
Further, a true believer will not engage in usury</span><sup><span

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">avoid
this out of your love of Goddess, so that you might prosper;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
know that Goddess does not create fearful fires of Hell for those that
go astray, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
lovingly creates plans for them; so obey Her and Her
prophetesses,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Her angels so that you will forever receive Her mercy.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.131
Take care against the unbelievers who lead you into error.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.132
Obey Goddess and Her prophetess, so that you will find mercy.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.133
And run with enthusiasm to obtain forgiveness from Goddess, and seek
Paradise,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">whose
magnitude equals the size of the heavens and earth combined, which is
prepared for you, </span>

The believer who cares for and believes in Goddess; who gives alms in
prosperity and adversity; </span>

<span style="font-size:

has an even temper, and who forgives others readily is blessed; </span>

<span style="font-size:

Goddess loves those full of the mercy, love and compassion that She
shows you.</span><sup><span

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.135
And the believers, after they have committed a crime or have dealt
unjustly with their own souls, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">remember
Goddess and ask Her for pardon of these mistakes, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess is the only true forgiver of error,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.136
Because for those who do not persevere in making intentional
mistakes,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">their
reward shall be lovely gardens wherein beautiful rivers flow,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they shall remain therein forever if they desire, and the reward of
those that labor for Goddess</span>

show love and gentle kindness towards others is most excellent.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.137
You have already seen how those that do not love Goddess suffer,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
they are perpetually lonely, scared and often live in poverty of the
soul and intellect, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
should look on those around you closely, and those that criticize
Goddess and Her prophetesses.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.138
This book is a declaration to women, and a direction and guide to the
pious,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.139
You should not be dismayed or grieved, for your lives will be far
superior in so many ways </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
those that do not believe and those live in darkness and
negativity.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.140
If a wound happens to you, as it may happen to an unbeliever,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
will help heal your wound, but this is not the case for an
unbeliever,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">these
slight changes occur so that some might notice and believe;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess will know those who believe, and those that are martyrs and
dedicate their entire lives </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">to
good works and making peace, because Goddess pays no attention to
workers of injustice;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.141
and Goddess shows these signs to others that might believe in order to
prove it,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">while
unbelievers are left to their own devices.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.142
Those who enter Paradise quickest will be those that Goddess knew fought
for love, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">kindness,
justice, mercy and caring to be spread throughout the world </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
those who persevered in such work with utmost patience.</span>

<span style="font-size:

Moreover, do not be discouraged when sometimes in your life </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
have wished for death before you met it, for life is so very hard and
sorrowful,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
yet you decided not to meet death intentionally, because this would be a
grievous mistake.</span><sup><span

Your prophetess is no more a prophetess than the others, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
other prophetesses came before Her and have died, and others will come
after Her to help you, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
will your turn your back on any of these? Anyone who turns her back
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
life becomes too difficult does not hurt Goddess at all, for She is self
sufficient, </span>

<span style="font-size:

Goddess surely rewards the thankful and the faithful.</span>

<span style="font-size:

No soul may die, except upon prior agreement with Goddess for a
determined time and place,</span>

<span style="font-size:

according to what has already been written in the heavenly
records.</span><sup><span

those who chose the reward of this world will be given the reward of
this world, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
is little or nothing compared with paradise, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
those who chose the world to come shall see Paradise, </span>

<span style="font-size:

the thankful will have abundance undreamed of in this world.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.146
Many prophetesses have encountered situations with myriads of dark
souls,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they did not despair in evangelizing for the true religion of love and
Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they were never weakened, nor did they behave poorly, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess loves those that persevere patiently.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.147
And when they prayed, they said “O Lady of Light, forgive us our
mistakes</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
our transgressions in business and our private lives and confirm our
paths back to You,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
help us against inhumane nations, to bring freedom and human rights to
all people in Your world.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.148
And Goddess gave them great return in their world, and in the world to
come,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess loves those that do good deeds.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.149
O true believers, if you believe the dark and negative souls,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
will cause you to regress in this life, and your souls will suffer
greatly;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.150
but Goddess is your Lady of Light, and She is your best helper and
protectress.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.151
We shall certainly attempt to strike love into the hearts of those that
are unbelievers,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they have associated negative actions and emotions with Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
which there is no authority, and they will suffer great sadness on the
day of their resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.152
And Goddess will most certainly make good Her promise to you,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
you were evangelizing so many people, yet you disobeyed one of the
leaders and left to plunder.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">There
were some among you that desired the present life, over the life to
come,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
the dark entities turned you towards the idols of greed and wealth,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so
that She would reveal your true selves. </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">However,
your prophetess pardoned you all, because Goddess is merciful to the
believers.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.153
Then later when you were in a difficult situation evangelizing another
large gathering,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
prophetess gave a signal that you were to leave, but most of you missed
it,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
there were some hardships because of it, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
in the end you were victorious in evangelizing hundreds of unbelievers.
</span>

<span style="font-size:

is well aware of what you have done and what you can do.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.154
After this seeming affliction, Goddess then caused you to fall into a
soft sleep</span><sup><span

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">which
fell on some of you very deep, but some others were troubled by their
own souls, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
to them sleep would not come; they began to think falsely of
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they imagined the foolish thought–“Has anything good happened to us
now?”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
most assuredly, the issue and resolution is not with anyone but
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
concealed in their own minds what they would not say to the
others,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Well,
if anything serious should happen to us, at least we were not killed
here.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Answer
them, “If you had been in your houses, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
still would have left them to go out and encounter danger and face
death,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
death is preordained, and you must go to the place where you would
die,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
this will come to pass so that Goddess can try what is in your
hearts,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so
She might discern a true spirit that will do Her work of peace and
love;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
Goddess knows the innermost parts of women and men.</span><sup><span

style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;"></span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.155
Certainly, those that turn their backs on others that do good
works,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">it
is because the dark entities entice them to do so,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they engage in the commission of crimes and mistakes, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess will forgive them if they ask Her; for Goddess is gracious and
merciful to all.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.156
O true believers, be not as the darkened souls that told others</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
they traveled in the land, or had been on a difficult mission,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“If
they had been with us, then they would not have died, nor would they
have been slain,” </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
tell them “What befell you was preordained,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">so
that Goddess might test you for the strength of your heart in enduring
adversity.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Goddess
gives life; and by your agreement with Goddess, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">your
life shall cease at a time preordained by both of you; for Goddess sees
what you do,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet
be not afraid for She is with you always.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.157
And if you die or are slain while doing good deeds,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
will immediately pass to Goddess and Paradise;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
as to the mercy granted to the disobedient from Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
prophetesses are often kind to them, but if anyone has been particularly
evil and hard hearted, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
separate themselves from their Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.158
But whether you die or you are killed, certainly you will experience
your day of resurrection,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
this is a promise and blessing from Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.159
Therefore, forgive them, and ask pardon for them, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
consult with them in the affairs of kindness and gentleness; and after
you have become debilitated, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
trust solely in Goddess, for Goddess loves those that trust in
Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.160
If Goddess helps you, then none shall conquer you in any manner;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
She is never deprived simply because you have not dedicated yourself to
Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Understand
that your assistance is limited to only what you can do, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
life on earth is indeed a dangerous situation.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.161
It has been decreed that no prophetess will ever be guilty of a breach
of trust,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
they are carefully selected for you and obey what Goddess has
commanded,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
for others, anyone that is guilty of a breach of trust, will feel the
pain and the humiliation </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
breach has caused others on the day of her resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.162
Do you think that a true believer will be considered the same as one
that does not obey Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">or
one that does as she pleases and is expedient? Of course not!</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">These
people shall have additional trials and tribulations until they turn to
Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they will be bound to the earth over and over again.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.163
As to the prophetesses and the believers, they are exalted about the
rest, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in
degrees of rank and grace. Goddess sees all that you do.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.164
Goddess bestows great blessings upon a believer when She raises them to
be a great prophetess;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
then she is cleansed and purified, and she is taught the Scriptures and
she is taught wisdom,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
though before this she may have been steeped in great error.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.165
So when you suffer a loss, as when you recently did, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you were unable to evangelize a majority of the unbelievers, you should
be aware that before this </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">you
were successful in a great many conversions to the true religion of
Goddess; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in
fact twice as much more so than at this recent loss.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.166
And what happened recently was that these people were extraordinary
stubborn and arrogant,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet
Goddess did this so that She would know the believers from the
unbelievers.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.167
And She also desired to distinguish the hypocrites from the believers.
For it was said to them,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Come
out and evangelize for the true religion, or at least help the
others.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
replied, “If we knew the people were so nasty and the land so
poor,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you needed so much help, we certainly would have come along had we known
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">this
would help so many people believe and turn to Her.”</span><sup><span
style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">12<a href="#_ftn126" id="_ftnref126">6</a></span></sup><span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;"></span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">At
this point, they were closer too disbelief than belief.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
were saying things which their minds did not believe. But Goddess knows
all they conceal.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.168
But some of you said to their sisters, “If they had all come with
us,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">then
many people would not have been killed.” But know that this is not the
case,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
no entity on earth can avert death; this is the sole prerogative of
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.169
You need not even think that those who died during a difficult mission
are even truly dead.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
not. They are alive and in the glory of the company of Goddess and Her
angels,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they are well provided for in a glorious place.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.170
They are joyous because of what Goddess has bestowed upon them.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
received a glad welcoming, and they watch over those that are upon the
earth,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
those that have not yet joined them; and they have no cause to fear, nor
are they grieved.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.171
They receive glad tidings out of the goodness that they accomplished
during their lives;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Goddess does not suffer any reward owed to the righteous to
perish.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.172
Those who have responded to the call of Goddess and Her
prophetess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
after they had been injured and suffered on a prior mission,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
those that had done their duty well, and had guarded against evil by
avoiding violence,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">hate
and rage in the land and only brought peace and love, will have a great
reward with Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.173
For those that suffered through several missions, they were told,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Soldiers
have assembled against you, for what you preach, so fear them.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
this only increased their faith in Goddess, and they replied,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">“Goddess
is the best protectress for us, and She is an Excellent
Provider.”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.174
Then they returned with a great blessing from Goddess, and many souls
were saved.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">They
suffered no harm whatsoever, and they followed the commands of
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Indeed
Goddess is the best provider of abounding bounty.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.175
You should be aware that it is Evil that tells you that you should have
fear,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
it is Evil that exhorts others to incite fear in you and around you,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
Evil tells you worst of all, to fear Me.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
you should never fear Me, for I am all love, and you should love Me
deeply instead.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.176
And do not let those who compete for evil works grieve you. </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Certainly
they cannot harm Goddess one iota. </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Those
that have not helped others and never did any good works,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will
have no share of blessings in the afterlife; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">rather
they will be deeply saddened on the day of their resurrection </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">when
they see all the good they might have done, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
all the pain they caused others, because they were never guided by
Her.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.177
Those who prefer disbelief to belief do not in any manner harm
Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
a very sad day of resurrection awaits them.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.178
But those who are unbelievers should not think that their long lives on
earth</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">entitles
them to permanent respite for all the evil works they have done. </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">For
they are granted a period of respite, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
this is only to increase the chance that they will repent and turn to
Her. </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
longer they persist in disbelief and evil works, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">the
more sadness they will encounter on the day of their
resurrection.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.179
And Goddess will not leave the believers until She has distinguished the
evil doers from the good.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Nor
will Goddess reveal all the secrets of heaven and earth at this
time,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
She chooses from among you prophetesses to reveal what is best for you
at the time it is revealed.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Therefore,
believe in Goddess and Her prophetesses and you will be assured of a
great reward.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">3.180
And do not let the stingy persons among you think that Goddess has
increased her bounty</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
she refuses to help others, rather this is very grievous for her, if
only she knew it.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">On
the day of her resurrection, she will feel and experience all the pain
that she caused others</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
she would not believe in Goddess and give reasonably out of her bounty,
to those in need.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
error will seem as if it is heavily hung about her neck, </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">as
she reviews her life on the day of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>her resurrection. </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">And
all things will return to Goddess. Goddess knows all that you have
done.</span>

The unbelievers and the prophetess slayers will suffer greatly on the
day of their resurrection,</span>

Some of the people say, “Goddess has said that we should not believe in
any prophetess,</span>

She brings us a miracle wherein she is consumed by fire and still
lives.”</span>

<span style="font-size:

should reply to them, “Certainly prophetesses have come before that did
not live through fire,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
you will note they brought clear signs and Scriptures of love, and you
would still not believe.</span>

<span style="font-size:

then, would you demand that a prophetess needs to live through raining
fire?”</span><sup><span

standards,</span>

<span style="font-size:

all prior prophetesses were imposters, when they only brought only
evident demonstrations, </span>

You will be proved in your possessions and in your person,</span>

<span style="font-size:

you,</span>

for those that idolize only wealth, greed and power; again, there will
be much soul grief for this;</span>

<span style="font-size:

people that love Her,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

Goddess does not pay any attention to those that speak ill of anyone in
public;</span>

Those that do not believe in Goddess, or Her prophetesses,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">will
often say, “We believe some of the prophetesses, but reject others,”
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they

<span style="font-size:

but they do not truly believe in all that is good and wonderful,</span>

<span style="font-size:

although there is no punishment, Goddess will devise plans which will
correct this misbehavior, </span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

such people merely lack love for themselves and for others.<span

<span style="font-size:

make no distinction between any of them, </span>

Some people who have received the Scriptures have demanded</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">that
a good book should descend from heaven for the benefit of the
world,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
formerly asked of Miriam a greater thing than this; for they said, “Show
us Goddess visibly.”<span style="mso-tab-count:1">                
</span></span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">But
a storm of fire came from heaven as a natural disaster, and many were
destroyed,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">although
Miriam warned them of this upcoming disaster, most were stubborn </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
would not listen to their prophetess that preached only love and
goodwill,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">yet
they were prayed for, and again they lived by the grace of
Goddess.</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Then
they took a golden calf for a goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">even
after they had been given evident proofs that Goddess was not a
calf;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
again they were forgiven, despite the fact that Miriam had</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">tremendous
earthly powers to punish them as a chieftess over them;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Miriam’s
heart was pure, and she would most certainly never do such a
thing;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">for
by the purification of Goddess, she only acted from pure love, and would
harm no one.</span>

they made their covenant with Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they were told to enter the gates of the new city worshiping
Goddess.<span style="mso-tab-count:

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
people were also told not to err on the Sabbath day,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they made a firm agreement with the prophetess to observe their
covenants.<span

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">4.155
But then, after that, they did not keep their covenants, and did not
believe in the signs of Goddess,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
they killed the prophetesses unjustly and have said, “Our hearts are
hardened,”</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
Goddess did not harden them, for their own choices did, and the darkness
of the world did;</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

And those people that have a hard heart </span>

<span style="font-size:

not hear or understand the sweetness of the words of Yeshua;</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">they
speak of Mother Mary with derision and contempt, for they do not see her
sweetness and love,</span>

Goddess;</span>

<span style="font-size:

some say that Yeshua was not slain, nor was he crucified,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">but
there was one in his likeness that assumed this role; </span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
there were also those that disagreed with Yeshua, and those that did not
understand,</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">and
those that had many different opinions,</span>

<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

the opinion is not so important as the message of love that was
taught.<span

say that Yeshua was not really killed, just that Goddess took Yeshua
directly up to Her, </span>

Goddess is knowing and wise.</span>

is forbidden them by the Law of Goddess,</span>

they have devoured a person’s substance frivolously,</span>

declare good tidings </span>

denounce threats, darkness and evil, </span>

will devise plans for them to set them on the right path, </span>

also encounter soul suffering on the day of their resurrection,</span>

they will not have a protectress, nor will Goddess show them the way,
</span>

<span style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">because
they do not ask Her to; the dark entities only request that She aide and
abet them </span>

11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">in
their own nasty emotions, which She would never do.</span>

creation of woman on earth, the Arabs have several different traditional
stories, which differ somewhat from Genesis. They say that the angels
Gabrielle, Michael and Cassial were sent by Goddess one after another,
to fetch for that purpose seven handfuls of earth from different depths
and different colors to represent seven different styles or ethnicities
of woman, but Mother Earth being apprehensive of the consequence, and
desiring to communicate this fear to Goddess, that the earth creatures
would one day rebel against Her, and bring only toil and trouble, they
returned without performing Her command; whereupon She sent Cassial on
the same errand, who executed this task without remorse, yet in a kind
and loving manner, and so for this reason, Goddess appointed that angel
to separate the souls from the bodies and this angel became the angel of
death. The earth that Cassial had taken was carried to Arabia, to a
place between Mecca and Tayef, where it was first kneaded by the angels,
then it was fashioned by Goddess into human form, and left to dry for
forty days and forty nights (or years, according to some); the angels in
the meantime visited this human form, and Eblis (one of the angels at
the time being closest to Goddess, but later becoming a fallen angel or
devil), went over and kicked the form until it rung because he knew that
Goddess wanted to make this creature superior to the angels, and he
there and then made a secret resolution to never acknowledge this new
creation, this woman, as such. After this, Goddess animated the new
creature by imbibing it with a soul, or a Goddess spark from within, and
placed her in Paradise and formed a man from her left side to be her
companion in Eden. Of course this is only a l</span>egend; woman was
created from Goddess.

scolded the Sabbath-breakers, and accordingly they were turned into apes

font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">The
Arab version of the “red cow” legend relates that there was once a man
who left his daughter, then a child, a female calf, which wandered in
the desert until the girl came of age. At this point, the mother told
her daughter the heifer was hers, and requested that she take the cow to
market and sell it for three pieces of gold. But when the young woman
came to the market, a strange and beautiful woman immediately came up to
the young woman and said she would buy the cow for six pieces of gold.
The young woman suspected the stranger was actually an angel, so she
replied she would have to ask her mother about the sale. The angel
replied that if she would not tell her mother, she would buy the cow
immediately for twice what she had just offered, but the young woman
replied she must ask her mother first. When she returned home and told
her mother about the generous lady, the mother knew that the lady was
actually an angel, and told her daughter to go back to the market and
ask the angel about what she intended to do with the cow. When she
returned back to the market, the young woman asked about what the lady
would do with the cow, and the angel told her that in a short period of
time, the Israelites would buy the cow from her at any price. Soon
thereafter, an Israelite, named Hammiel, was killed by a relation of
his, who, to prevent discovery, took the body some distance away to hide
it. The friends of Hammiel were then wrongfully accused of the murder.
They denied vociferously they were murderers and Miriam asked Goddess
what should be done and She replied that a certain bright red cow must
be found and sacrificed. The friends could not find any such cow, except
as owned by the girl and</span> her mother, and they were therefore
obliged to buy it. <span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Some
say they had to pay as much gold as the cow’s hide could hold, others
reported that they paid the full weight of the cow in gold, and some say
even ten times that was paid! By divine direction, a portion of the
sacrificed cow fell on the dead body of the murder victim, he revived,
stood up and then named his murderer. After this, it is the burnt ashes
of a red heifer which were then used by the Israelites to ritually
purify someone after touching a corpse, which was considered religiously
“unclean,” and also a red heifer came to be synonymous with the
determination of an uncertain murder.</span>

style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Another
tale is told that Evil came and tempted Salome without success, and it
tried to trick her into tarnishing her character. Evil caused some
unbelievers to write several books of dark prayers and hide them under
Salome’s throne, and after her death, some dark entities told the chiefs
that if they wanted to know by what means Salome had obtained her
absolute power, they should dig under her throne; which having been
done, they found the dark, evil books, which contained impious prayers
for hate and harm against others. The better sort refused to learn such
evil arts, but many of the people read and learned evil; and the priests
published this scandalous story of Salome, which obtained credit among
some people, until Goddess cleared Salome through the prophetess
declaring that “Salome was no evil sorcerer.” </span>

style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Harut
and Marut were supposedly two magicians or angels sent by Goddess to
teach the people evil dark magic and to tempt them. But others tell a
longer legend; that the angels expressing their surprise at the
wickedness of the children of Eve and Adam, after prophetesses had been
sent to them with divine commissions, Goddess allowed them to choose two
out of their own number to be sent down to be judges on earth. Whereupon
Harut and Marut were chosen, and they executed their office with
integrity for some time, until Zohara or the planet Venus, descended and
appeared before them in the shape of a beautiful young woman bringing a
complaint allegedly involving her husband; however, some say that
perhaps she may have even been a real woman. As soon as Harut and Marut
saw her, they sought to have her and they harassed her for sex, but she
flew up to heaven for safety. The two angels then attempted to return to
heaven, but were not admitted, for their base and lustful treatment of
her as merely an object of desire. However, upon the prayers of those
who they had earlier helped, and who interceded for them, Harut and
Marut were allowed by Goddess to chose works of atonement in either this
life or the afterlife, whereupon, they chose the former where they were
put to work in the area of Babel, helping others until the end of life
on earth. It is rumored that if someone wants to learn dark or black
magic, they may go there and Harut and Marut are bound to teach it, but
only with dire warnings. Also, the two angels can be heard, but not
seen.</span>

<span
style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
story appears to be one similar to that taught by the Persian Magi, who
relate that two rebellious angels of the same name came to be hung
upside down between this world and the next as a sort of punishment also
for their womanizing. Further, a Jewish legend tells the story of an
angel Shamhozai, who chased a woman and entered into sexual error, thus
he subsequently hung himself up between heaven and earth to stay chaste.
Of course the story is pure allegory because angels are pure light and
love and are one with Goddess.</span>

style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">Rania
and Odharna both mean “look upon us” and are a type of greeting between
Arabians. However, the prophetess did not like the former because Jews
used it in jest based upon a similar sounding Hebrew word meaning “to be
bad” or “mischievous.” </span>

is clear that in the Book of the Cow, the prophetess declares the
Paradise is available for all that love Goddess and do “what is right;”
other, perhaps later passages in the Koran make it clear that Paradise
is only for faithful believers, so the former should control because it
is more loving than the later, with love being the pure essence of
Goddess.</span>

Evil blamed Goddess for their crime. About 8 days later, Esther happened
to pass by and saw the corpses and began to weep. (Esther means “star”).
Goddess saw this and said to Esther ,“Call out to them and I will make
them live again.” And on Esther’s call, the dead rose up and lived again
for a few more years. Unfortunately, the rising up of the dead was not
perfect, and they arose, but still retained the stench and decayed look
of the dead and their clothes had turned pitch black, which
characteristics they passed on to their children. Some say that there
were 3,000 such people, others say 70,000. The story is reminiscent of

The prophetess won many converts with only 319 disciples at her side,
versus near a thousand on the other side. This was her first mission for
peace and good religion and it ensured her status and power in the
ancient community. Tales relate that during this mission the prophetess
threw flowers in the air and in the direction of the archangel Gabrielle
shouting “May their faces be overcome with love, peace and
understanding,” whereupon, the other side immediately came to listen to
the words of the Korana. But some say it was not the prophetess that
threw the flowers, but Goddess or one of Her angels. Further, the
prophetess’ league of disciples appeared to them to be twice as large as
any of their converts, yet she won, so this was also a miracle. Finally,
it has been related that Goddess sent down first 1,000, then 3,000
angels that appeared, led by archangel Gabrielle on her horse Haigum,
and the angels actually did all the evangelizing alongside the
prophetess’ missionaries, and the prophetess’ disciples only imagined
they were preaching effectively.</span><span

questioner then said that was the Jewish religion. Then the prophetess
replied, “the Pentateuch then will decide.” 2) Another interpretation
relates that two adulterers were to be stoned, a common barbaric
practice in some ancient societies. The prophetess did not want to have
them stoned, but an angry crowd did; the prophetess said the “Law” was
found in the Pentateuch, but this is not a law of Goddess, and yet the
angry crowd attempted to prevail, but the prophetess prevailed upon an
angel to come and protect the couple from harm. Although the crowd
heaped and heaped up stones, all the stones rolled away, and none of
them harmed the couple. It should be noted that the “law of Miriam” that
adulterers are to “be put to death” is found in the Pentateuch, but not
that they must be specifically stoned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">

word “Christ” means “King” and the word “Jesus” means “Jewish” in Greek,
and so the phrase Jesus Christ meant “Jewish King.” However, from
historical records it would appear that his given name was “Jeshua” or
“Yeshua,” with surnames or family names not being commonly used until
about the 1900's when censuses were first taken and children attending
public schools became common place.</span><span

style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">It
should be noted that when a woman was engaged or “betrothed” in the
first century BCE, at the time Jesus was born, typically she would go to
her betrothed’s home during the engagement period and live with him.
During that time, if she did not become pregnant or bear a child,
usually, but not always, the engagement was terminated and the family
would seek another match that would result in a healthy child and only
then would the couple finally marry. This is due to the extreme pressure
on couples to have children and couples without children were often
discriminated against. Hence, almost all first born babies at that time
were “virgin” births, with the word “virgin” meaning a woman that had
not born a child, and not a woman that had never had sexual intercourse.
It should be noted that Yeshua made several statements concerning the
blessedness of those that did not have children, especially since he had
no children.</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"></span>

style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
story is taken from one of the 200+ gospels in existence circa 150 CE to
325+ CE in which a few related that Yeshua was not born in a stable, but
was born away from Bethlehem, and Zacharias sent Joseph to find Mary,
and Joseph began to ask her questions, but she gave no reply. Instead,
the child answered, “Goddess has brought me forth from the darkness of
the uterus to be the light to the world, and I shall go to the children
of Israel and invite them back into the love and light of Goddess.” This
is one gospel which was preserved by eastern Christians, i.e. east of
Jerusalem, in that the vast majority of the myriad of Yeshua Gospels
were systematically destroyed, banned and burned west of Jerusalem.
Circa 325 CE, Roman Emperor Constantine and Pope Augustine decided that
only the four “synoptic gospels” of Matthew, Mark, Luke-Acts and John
were acceptable for a standard or “official” New Testament they were
compiling at the time. Moreover, carbon dating on the oldest texts
found, still clearly put them being written at least 70 years after the
death of Yeshua, and the oldest was well more than 100 years later. They
also added Paul’s Letters and the letters of some other disciples.
Although the gospels are entitled with supposed names of the original 12
apostles--Matthew, Mark, James, John, etc., it is highly unlikely the
original 12 apostles wrote any of these, because the oldest texts
documented were in fluent Greek, and none of the original 12 apostles
spoke, and certainly did not write, Greek. It is well known that Luke
was a physician that collected Yeshua stories c. 100 CE and wrote them
down. After this period, other Gospels and the fact that Yeshua was a
Mt. Carmel</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt">ite Essene was
systematically oppressed and important documentation destroyed or
hidden. In another Infancy Gospel story, some say the bird was a bat,
although others say several different types of birds. However, Sylvia
Browne and Edgar Cayce have disputed the Infancy Gospels and say that
Yeshua was a normal child until he became an adult.</span>

story is from the “Infancy Gospels” and is commonly available today, but
not in the New Testament. Some Christians consider these texts to be
heresy, but nonetheless they do exist in ancient literature common at
the time following Yeshua’ life. In another “Infancy Gospel,” it is told
the story of how Yeshua spoke and said, “I am Yeshua, the son of
Goddess, the Word which you have brought forth, as the angel Gabrielle
told my mother, and Goddess has sent me to save the world.”</span><span

as told by the Synoptic gospels did raise 3 persons from the dead; 1)
(John 11:1) Lazarus, brother of Martha died and was in the tomb three
days before Yeshua raised him from the dead and it is told that the tomb
stank, 2) (Matthew 9.1) Jairus’ daughter, and 3) (Luke 7:11) A widow’s
son is raised back to life. Compare with Edgar Cayce’s story of Ruth,
where Ruth lamented that Yeshua did not help Joseph their father when he
died in his 50's, but she was told that this was Joseph’s chosen
time.</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"></span>

probably referring to the fact that Essenes typically wore simple white

was a man named Titan who was told by Judas to enter a window and kill
Yeshua, but Titan was taken instead. Some add that the effigy taken down
was resurrected to earth to comfort the kin of Yeshua and the holy women
and disciples. Others relating tales that Yeshua did not die on the
cross included the Basilidins, who say that Simon the Cyrenean was
crucified instead, and so did the Chrintheans and the Carpocratians, and
Photeus relates a story where Yeshua watched his own crucifixion from
heaven, laughing and did not suffer at all. The Gospel of Barnabus
related that prior to crucifixion, 4 archangels: Gabrielle, Michael,
Ariel and Raphaella, took Yeshua to the third heaven and Judas was
crucified instead.</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"></span>

Mary Magdalene became a high priestess and one of the holy women. Mother
Mary was a high priestess and healer, and many today call upon her for
her healing powers. Yeshua’s teacher was Joanna, and one of the holy
women and all the holy women were present with him when he hung on the
cross; all the male apostles had fled and stopped teaching the gospel of
Yeshua for a period of time, but the women never did. Yeshua was
supported in his ministry by many wealthy women that were either
merchants or widows. It is said that there were 12 or more main holy
women that were either high priestesses and/or prophetesses and they
were the backbone for starting the new Christian sect which was
originally part of Judaism. With regards to Mary Magdalene, for years
she had been plagued with mental illness. Yeshua, upon meeting her,
realigned her 12 chakras, hence the phrase “drove out 12 demons from
her”– is clearly an allegorical healing reference.</span><span

prophetess put an end to this and taught that one should only marry out
of love for the other person.</span><span

this passage was in the negative and may have referred to the Jews that
first believed in Miriam, and then fell into idolatry by worshiping the
golden calf, but then repented, but then fell away again by not
believing either Yeshua or the prophetess. </span><span

style="font-size:
11.0pt;font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Maiandra GD&quot;">This
passage, has been interpreted in several ways. The first being that
everyone, even if they did not believe in Yeshua during life, will then,
at the time of her death, see Yeshua and know that he was truly an
ascended master. Others say that those that did not believe in Yeshua
will see him upon death and know him to be an Ascended Master, but this
will be to no avail, and they will be punished for this. Still another
theory holds that according to a tradition of Hejaj, when a Jew is
expiring, the angels will strike him on the back and face and say to him
“O enemy of god, Yeshua was sent to you as a prophet and you did not
believe,” and the newly dead Jew will answer, “I now know Yeshua was a
prophet of Goddess.” Another tradition holds that all Christians will be
told “Yeshua was sent to you as a prophet of Goddess, and you imagined
he was a God or a Child of Goddesss. Of course, heaven and Goddess do
not punish, but upon death, each person returns to Her and they see
clearly all of what they did, and they will know all the prophets and
prophetesses living in paradise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes"> 
</span>Further, the angels do not beat or strike or humiliate anyone,
they are pure love.</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"></span>

be referring to the three ancient goddess of Islam, as noted above, or
the Christian concept of Father, Son and Holy Ghost where some say God
is the father, Yeshua is the son, and the Holy Ghost the spirit descent
from the divine, or Mother Goddess, although the Holy Ghost exists in
ancient Scriptures preceding the New Testament. Ancient religions find
the trinity to be Father God, Mother God and their offspring the earth,
normally depicted as a female infant. Many of such statutes still exist
in Europe today. Gnostics and other early Christians believed the Holy
Spirit to be the essence of Mother God that lived on earth, closest to
humanity. </span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"></span>

the government is give half an estate where the next of kin is remote,
if there is not will or conflicting law. However, true believers should
greatly consider charitable bequests when they have no next of kin or
friend in need, for a bequest to a good charity is better than an estate
left to the government. Further all rules regarding bequests related
herein are only given as general guidelines and considerations to the
believe and should be construed so that women are left an equal amount
as men are, to the same degree of kinship, and further that families are
not left in poverty and are provided for in the manner in which they
were supported during the lifetime of the decedent. A good muslima
always provides for her family and dependents through life insurance or
other means upon her death.</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt"></span>
