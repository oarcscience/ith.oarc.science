### No. XXVII

#### CONCERNING CHRISTIAN PANTHEISM <span id="fr_117"></span>[3](#fn_117.md)

THE crucifixion of Jesus was an actual fact, but it had also a spiritual
signification; and it is to this spiritual meaning, and not to the
physical fact, that the whole of the mystical writings of the Christians
refer.

The fundamental truth embodied in the crucifixion is Pantheism. God is
in all creatures; and the stage of purification by fire, through which
all being is now passing, is the crucifixion of

\[paragraph continues\] God. Jesus, as the most perfect of initiates, is
selected by the Christian mystics as the representative of God. He is
for them, as Buddha for the Buddhist mystics, God manifest in the flesh.
In his crucifixion, therefore, is the symbol and type of the continual
crucifixion of God in his suffering creatures, which crucifixion is the
means and cause of their purification, and thus of their redemption.
"These," says God, "are the wounds wherewith I was wounded in the house
of My friends." <span id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_118.md) Which means, "I am
wounded in the body or person of all creatures who are Mine--who are
sealed unto Me." For "the house of my friends" is nothing more than the
mystical phrase for the temple of the body of others. "Enter thou into
my house, O Lord!" cries the holy soul who desires to be visited while
in the body by the Divine Presence. And the Man-God, showing His five
mystical wounds to the Angels, thus declares, "These are the wounds of
My crucifixion wherewith I am wounded continually in the persons of
those who are Mine. For I and My brethren are one, as God is One in Me."
