### No. XLVIII

#### CONCERNING THE CHRISTIAN MYSTERIES <span id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_182.md)

##### PART I

THE two terms of the history of creation or evolution are formulated by
the Catholic Church in two precious and all-important dogmas. These
are--first, the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary; and,
secondly, the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. <span
id="fr_183"></span>[2](#fn_183.md) By the doctrine of the first we are
secretly enlightened concerning the generation of the soul, who is
begotten in the womb of matter, and yet from the first instant of her
being is pure and incorrupt. Sin comes through the material and
intellectual element, because these belong to matter. But the soul,
which is of the celestial, and belongs to heavenly conditions, is free
of original sin. "Salem, which is from above, is free, which is the
mother of us all. But Agar"--the intellectual and astral part--"is a
bond slave, both she and her son." The soul, born of time (Anna), is yet
conceived without taint of corruption or decay, because her essence is
divine. <span id="fr_184"></span>[3](#fn_184.md) Contained in matter, and
brought into the world by means of it, she is yet not of it, else she
could not be mother of God. In her bosom is conceived that bright and
holy light--the Nucleolus--which dwells in her from the beginning, and
which, without intercourse with matter, germinates in her and manifests
itself as the express image of the eternal and ineffable personality.
She gives this image individuality. Through and in her it is

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

focused and polarised into a perpetual and self-subsistent person, at
once God and man. But were she not immaculate,--did any admixture of
matter enter into her integral substance,--no such polarisation of the
Divine could occur. The womb in which God is conceived must be
immaculate; the mother of Deity must be "ever-virgin." She grows up from
infancy to childhood at the knee of Anna; from a child she becomes a
maiden,--true type of the soul, unfolding, learning, increasing, and
elaborating itself by experience. But in all this she remains in her
essence divine and uncontaminated, at once daughter, spouse, and mother
of God.

As the Immaculate Conception is the foundation of the mysteries, so is
the Assumption their crown. For the entire object and end of cosmic
evolution is precisely this triumph and apotheosis of the soul. In the
mystery presented by this dogma, we behold the consummation of the whole
scheme of creation--the perpetuation and glorification of the individual
human ego. The grave--the material and astral consciousness--cannot
retain the immaculate Mother of God. She rises into thee heavens; she
assumes divinity. In her own proper person she is taken up into the
King's chamber. From end to end the mystery of the soul's evolution--the
history, that is, of humanity and of the kosmic drama--is contained and
enacted in the cultus of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The acts and the
glories of Mary are the one supreme subject of the holy mysteries.

##### PART 2 <span id="fr_185"></span>[1](#fn_185.md)

It is necessary, in relation to the Mysteries, to distinguish between
the unmanifest and the manifest, and between the

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

macrocosm and the microcosm. These last, however, are identical, in that
the process of the universal and the process of the individual are one.

Mary is the soul, and as such the matrix of the divine
principle--God--made man by individualisation, through descent into the
"Virgin's womb." But the seven principles of universal spirit are
concerned in this conception; since it is through their operation in the
soul that she becomes capable of polarising divinity.

\[This is the secret aspect of the Mosaic week of Creation, each day of
which week denotes the operation of one of the Seven creative Elohim or
Divine Potencies concerned in the elaboration of the spiritual
microcosm.\]

It is said that the Blessed Virgin Mary is the daughter, spouse, and
mother of God. But inasmuch as spiritual energy has two conditions, one
of passivity and one of activity,--which latter is styled the Holy
Spirit,--it is said that Mary's spouse is not the Father, but the Holy
Ghost, these terms implying respectively the static and the dynamic
modes of Deity. For the Father denotes the motionless, the force,
passive and potential, in whom all things *are*--subjectively. But the
Holy Ghost represents will in action,--creative energy, motion and
generative function. Of this union of the Divine will in action--the
Holy Ghost-with the human soul, the product is Christ, the God-Man and
our Lord. And through Christ, the Divine Spirit, by whom he is begotten,
flows and operates.

In the trinity of the unmanifest, the great deep, or ocean of
infinitude--Sophia (Wisdom)--corresponds to Mary, and has for spouse the
creative energy of whom is begotten the Manifestor, Adonai, *the* Lord.
This "Mother" is co-equal with the Father, being primary and eternal. In
manifestation the "Mother" is derived, being born of Time (Anna), and
has for Father the Planet-God--for our planet, Iacchos Joachim, or
Jacob; <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_186.md) so that the paternity of
the first person of the Trinity is vicarious only. The Church,
therefore, being a Church of the manifest, deals with

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Mary (substance), under this aspect alone, and
hence does not specify her as co-equal with the first principle. In the
unmanifest being underived, she has no relation to time.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[121:1](cws52.htm#fr_185.md) Home, August 19,
1883. Mrs Kingsford thus prefaces this; exposition in her diary:--

"How wonderfully the Church helps one in matters of Theosophy! When I am
doubtful about Divine Order, or about function in the human kingdom, I
appeal instinctively to Catholic doctrine, and am at once set in the
right path. I think I should never have clearly understood the Order and
Function of the Soul but for the Catholic teaching concerning the Mother
of God; nor should I have comprehended the Method of Salvation by the
Merits of our Divine Principle, save for the doctrine of the Incarnation
and the Atonement."

Between Catholic doctrine in its inner and true meaning, however, and
that doctrine as set before the world, she recognised an absolute
distinction, holding firmly to the dictum that "The Church has all the
truth, but the priests have materialised it, making themselves and their
followers idolaters."    E. M.

Referred to in *Life of Anna Kingsford*, vol. ii, pp. 133-135.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[122:1](cws52.htm#fr_186.md) Ps. xxiv, 6; cxxxii,
2, 5, etc. See Appendix, "Definitions." Every kosmic entity, whether a
system, a planet, or a person, is constituted of a certain portion of
Divinity, segregated and assigned to be its life and substance. These
names designate that particular individuation of the universal deity of
which we and our planet consist. Wherefore Mary, as the perfected human
soul, is "daughter" of the planet-god, precisely as her "son" Christ,
the perfected human spirit, is "son" of the planet-god. The soul is at
once "daughter, mother, and spouse of God," as woman is at once
daughter, mother, and spouse of man.    E. M.
