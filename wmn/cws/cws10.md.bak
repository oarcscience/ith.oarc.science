### No. VI

#### CONCERNING THE MOSAIC COSMOGONY <span id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56.md)

THE opening chapters of Genesis have, in some of their applications, a
reference to the Mysteries. The following are some of their manifold
meanings.

In the first chapter (and beginning of the second) is related the
creation of human nature in its two divisions, intellect and intuition,
body and soul, man and woman, each creation occurring by development or
evolution out of lower forms, through the successive incarnations of the
individual.

In the second chapter (beginning at verse 4) is described humanity (or
Adam), male and female, in a state of mere intellectualism or external
reason, and before the advent of revelation or religious perception.
Here the allegory refers to the race and to the individual alike, and
treats of man as sense and soul, priest and prophet, world and church.

The Tree of Life is the Central Will or Divine Life, the God, that is,
whether of the universe or of the individual. And the Tree of Knowledge
is experience which comes of trespass, or a descent from the region of
spirit to that of matter. It is thus Maya, or illusion; and the serpent,
or tempter, is the impulse by yielding to which the inward reality of
Being is abandoned for the outward appearance, and idolatry is committed
through the preference of the symbol to the verity, of the form to the
substance. The phrase "coats of skin" implies a deeper descent into
materiality, and the consequent need of multiplied penances and
transmigrations.

The Tree of Life signifies also the secret of regeneration, or final
transmutation into pure spirit, and the consequent attainment of eternal
life, which can come only when all the necessary processes have been
performed, and the soul-Eve-is once more pure and free, when she becomes
"Mary."

In the Mysteries the Adam of the second chapter signifies also the
ordinary earth-man, devoid of spiritual perception or consciousness, and
unable, therefore, at all to comprehend the mysteries. And Eve signifies
the seer and prophet, who, being illuminated in soul and taught of the
Spirit, has in his keeping the knowledge of things sacred, but is on no
account to divulge that knowledge to the outer world of mankind at
large. Springing from the heart of humanity, when its outer sense and
reason and passions are laid in sleep, or mystic trance, Eve is the
Sibyl, or "Mother," who has the sacred tree in charge, but may not
communicate of it. But being tempted by the prospect of sensuous reward,
she yields to the serpent of matter--or astral impulses--and
communicates the Mysteries to the vulgar, and thereby loses her
supremacy over men, and from being their mistress and ruler, becomes
their slave, while the prophets, her offspring, are persecuted and
slain, so that all her revelations and proper ministrations are made in
pain and sorrow and labour. For it is characteristic of the vulgar, that
they reverence only what is unfamiliar and mysterious to them.

The Four Rivers springing from one source are the four elements which
enter into the composition alike of the whole and the part, the
universe, the planet, the individual, and the single (physiological)
cell. Together they constitute the fourfold being. Pison, which
surrounds and encloses the earth or mineral zone, and contains the
materials of wealth and fame, is the body, or material region. Gihon,
the river which runs through the land of burning, denotes the Vale of
Gehenna or purgatorial region, and is the "fiery body," the magnetic
belt between the body and the soul. Hiddekel, the river with the double
symbol of Two Languages, is that which leads back to the ancient time
and place of the soul's "innocence." For, being representative of the
soul, it occupies the soul's place between the material and the
spiritual part. The last is called the Euphrates, and implies the
innermost and highest, the Spirit, or Will. These four "rivers" go forth
into and constitute the whole universe, and all therein that is of a
fourfold nature. A portion of each is necessary to constitute a
molecule, or monad of the substance of creation, whether a

planet, a man, or a cell. For the cell is the type of the kosmos.

Now the signification of the Rivers of Eden is fourfold, denoting,
First, The four generations of the soul's evolution, individually and
collectively.

Secondly, The four stages of the soul's initiation and perfectionment.

Thirdly, The four interpretations of Scripture.

Fourthly, The four elemental spheres of nature in which the soul has its
generation and education.
