### No. XLV

#### CONCERNING PSYCHE <span id="fr_175"></span>[2](#fn_175.md)

(Continued from No. XLIII)

BUT it may make the subject clearer to thee if, leaving such material
comparisons, we speak of those things which only may be fitly compared
together. Thou knowest already the nature of the planet and the
divisions of its Ego into four parts or regions. Of these thou knowest
that the soul or Psyche is in man, the human superior reason. Now there
appertains to the planet besides all these four regions, an atmosphere
of a magnetic nature. <span id="fr_176"></span>[3](#fn_176.md) This
atmosphere is well known to thee. It is the astral or sideral soul of
the planet, the *anima mundi* or picture-world. Therein are stored up
all the memories of the world: its past life, its history, its
affections and recollections of physical things. The adept may
interrogate this phantom world, and it shall speak for him. It is the
cast-off vestment of the planet; yet it is living and palpitating, for
its very fabric is spun of psychic substance, and its entire
*parenchyma* <span id="fr_177"></span>[4](#fn_177.md) is magnetic. And
forasmuch as the planet is an entity ever being born and ever dying, so
this astral counterpart of itself is ever in process of increase--the
mirror of the globe, a world encompassing a world. But the Divine
Spirit, Dio-Nysos, is not in this magnetic circle. God the Nous is in
the celestial, and the temple thereof is in the heart of humanity.

Such as is the astral world to the planet, the Ruach is to man. And in
truth the great magnetic sphere of the planet is itself composed and
woven out of the magnetic Egos of its offspring, precisely as these in
their turn are woven out of the infinitely

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

lesser atoms which compose the individual man. So that, by a figure, one
may represent the whole astral atmosphere of the planet as a system of
so many tiny spheres, each reflecting and transmitting special rays. But
if in this astral sphere thou shouldst seek the true soul and Divine
Spirit, thou shalt not find them; for they are of the higher altitudes.
To each world its Ruach, and but one. But the world's true soul migrates
and interchanges. And this is the secret of the "creation" of worlds.
Worlds, like men, have their karma, and new kosmic globes arise out of
the ruins of former states. As the soul of the individual human unit
transmigrates and passes on, so likewise does the Psyche of the planet.
From world to world, in ceaseless intercourse and impetus, the living
Neshamah pursues her variable way. And as she passes, the tincture of
her divinity changes. Here her spirit is derived through Iacchos, there
through Aphrodite, anon through Hermes or another god. Here, again, she
is weak, and there strong. Your planet did not begin this avatâr in
strength; an evil karma overwhelmed its soul, and evil lives
predominated in its first ages. Monstrous reptiles, creeping things, and
many fierce natures tore and devoured each other in the great deeps. For
the world-soul was weak, and brought forth with pain and trouble. But
Adonai reigns, and shall reign.

Now the physical molecules of the planet are its many generated bodies,
whether of plants, of animals, or of men; and these are continually
dropping into decay and being shed. But the living germs of all these
organisms die not; they revert continually to their proper place, and
the soul of each gathers strength by progression. And the ghost of each
living thing goes into the astral sphere, its proper place; and the dust
of each creature to the earth; and the Psyche departs to fulfil her
karma. For Psyche is as a flame within a flame, whereof the highest and
most luminous part mounts and wanders, while the heavier and the less
pure remains burning above the surface of the earth.

And as with the man, so with the planet; for small and great there is
one law. And one star differeth from another star in glory. And so
throughout the infinite vistas and systems of heaven. From star to star,
from sun to sun, from galaxy to galaxy, the kosmic souls migrate and
interchange. But every God keeps his tincture and maintains his
indefeasible personality.

There is no evil. There are only weak and strong, and the
differentiation of substance.

Compare like with like, and preserve the affinity of similars.

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

All things are explicable and comprehensible; but the key of their
explanation is order.

Order is the first word of analysis, and the alphabet of synthesis.
