### No. XXX

#### CONCERNING PAUL AND THE DISCIPLES OF JESUS <span id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124.md)

IN a vision which was given to me last night, it was represented to me
that the common view of Paul's character and position with regard to the
primitive Church is a totally false one; and the persons who made the
communication which I am about to relate, appeared to me to have been
personally acquainted with Paul, and to be thoroughly familiar with the
events occurring at the time of his apostleship. They told me, with
evident indignation, that the Christian Church of to-day entirely
misunderstands the relationship really existing between the apostles
whom Christ had instructed and elected as his

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

missionaries, and the converted Hebrew sacerdotalist. "It is amazing,"
they said, "that your Church can read in the writings extant concerning
our relations with Paul the account of the mistrust, suspicion, and
disfavour with which we always regarded him, and not see that he was
never one with us. The very leader and chief of our circle withstood him
to the face again and again, as though he had been an enemy of the
Church; and on one occasion he was forced to fly from the brethren by
night and by stratagem, so great and so bitter was the indignation his
view of the faith aroused among us who had been the Lord's friends, and
who knew the truth as Paul never saw it. For he imported into that pure
and simple rule of life a mass of Levitical and Rabbinical usages and
beliefs which we had shaken from us as the dust from our feet. He sunk
the realities of the Gospel of Jesus under an overwhelming weight of
hard sayings and sacerdotal misrepresentations. He, who had never known
the Master as he was, took upon himself to distort his image into that
of a strange God whom we had not known. Nor could we recognise in his
garbled version of the beautiful and willing martyrdom of the man whom
we had so dearly loved, a single trait of his character, or the least
resemblance to the doctrine he had taught us. What we had seen and known
as the pure and perfect love of a ready death, bravely borne for
conscience' sake, Paul presented to us in a new and unlovely guise as
the sacrifice of a victim to appease the anger of the God whom Jesus
called his Father and ours. Out of that which had been for us a simple
rule of life, a simple purging of the old faith, Paul erected the
strange and elaborate system which is called '*the scheme of the
Atonement*.' For us and our Master there had been no 'scheme'; God was
reconciled to man by love, and not by sacrifice. But Paul would have a
'new religion,' <span id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_125.md) and a creed hard
to understand; and he left to the world a Christianity of his own which
we knew not, but which is yours to-day. And in this he did us greater
evil and detriment than if he had persecuted and slain us all
physically. For by his false conversion he deceived the world and
drowned the truth by a flood of strange doctrines. For this we were all
against him, and never acknowledged his apostleship, being persuaded
that he knew not Christ nor the faith which Christ taught. Had he

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

been content with the truth, we would never have set our faces against
him; for he had many gifts, among which his eloquence was not the least.
But through his fatal perversion of the faith, and through his fatal
love of metaphysical doctrines and of Rabbinical subtleties, he
falsified that which was the glory of the Church, and brought into the
world the monstrous doctrines of the 'Christianity' which is preached in
your churches to-day."

I was further told, that on the night before Paul's escape in the basket
let down from the wall of Damascus, a violent altercation had taken
place between him and the brethren, in the course of which Paul had
maintained that the only chance for the final triumph of the Gospel lay
in its erection into a system, and one that must of necessity be
sacrificial. They then challenged him upon the point, but he insisted
that he saw further into the matter than they did, and that his special
mission lay in the elaboration of the plan he had conceived with regard
to Christ's position as a mediator between God and man.

\[The vision was entirely spontaneous and unexpected. I had not
previously given any attention to the subject; nor was I aware that a
similar instruction had some time previously been given to my colleague.

The personages I beheld in my vision bore no resemblance to any of the
numerous representations of the apostles made by painters, but I was far
from being in a sufficiently lucid condition to obtain an impression of
their appearance so vivid and distinct as to enable me, as usually is
the case, to make a drawing of them. Neither have I been able, with
anything like my accustomed accuracy, to reproduce their words. The tone
and substance, however, are faithfully rendered. The tone throughout was
that of strong indignation, mingled with regret, against Paul; and of
scorn at the folly of Christendom in accepting so gross and palpable a
perversion of the teaching of Jesus and nature of God as that involved
in the sacerdotal doctrine of vicarious atonement.\] <span
