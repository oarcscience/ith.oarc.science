### No. XLIII

#### CONCERNING PSYCHE, OR THE SUPERIOR HUMAN SOUL <span id="fr_168"></span>[2](#fn_168.md)

IT is truly said that God is the primordial mind, and that the kosmic
universe and its manifestations are the ideas of that mind. Mind in
itself is passive; it is organ, not function. Idea is active; it is
function. As soon, therefore, as mind begins to act, it brings forth
ideas, and these constitute existence. Mind is abstract; ideas are
concrete. When thou thinkest, thou createst. Every thought is a
substantial action.

Thoth, <span id="fr_169"></span>[3](#fn_169.md) therefore, is the creator
of the Kosmos. The science of the mysteries can be understood only by
one who has studied the physical sciences; because it is the climax and
crown of all these, and must be learned last, and not first. Unless thou
understand

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

the physical sciences, thou canst not comprehend the doctrine of
Vehicles, which is the basic doctrine of occult science. "If thou
understand not earthly things, how shall I make thee understand heavenly
things?" Wherefore, get knowledge, get knowledge, and be greedy of
knowledge, ever more and more. It is idle for thee to seek the inner
chamber until thou hast passed through the outer. This, also, is another
reason why occult science cannot be unveiled to the horde. To the
unlearned, no truth can be demonstrated. Theosophy <span
id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_170.md) is the royal science. If thou wouldst
reach the king's presence chamber, there is no way save through the
outer rooms and galleries of the palace.

In every living globule there are four inherent powers. I speak not now
of the component parts of a cell, but of forces. The first arid lowest
mode of power is mechanical; the second is chemical, the third is
electric, and the fourth is psychic. The first three belong to the
domain of physiological science; the last to that of occult science. It
is this last mode of power which belongs to the immaculate and
essential. It is inherent in the substantial, and is therefore permanent
as an indefeasible quantity. It is in the Arche, <span
id="fr_171"></span>[2](#fn_171.md) and it is wherever there is organic
life. Now the Psyche is from the beginning latent and diffused in all
matter; and forasmuch as Psyche also is not of herself, but of spirit,
therefore is spirit also the basic quality of all things;--the
motionless by motion converted into the solid;--the invisible by energy
made visible. So that herein are two:--that which is made visible, and
that which makes visible; and of these again is a third, that which is
visible.

And of this energy, or primordial force, there are two modes (because
everything is dual), the centrifugal or accelerating force; and the
centripetal or moderating force. (Yet, as I have already said, this
second mode of energy is feminine, and therefore derivative, being
reflex and complementary to its primary.) By means of the first force,
substance (Psyche) becomes matter. By Means of the second, substance
resumes her first condition. But in all matter there is a tendency to
revert to substance, and hence to polarise soul by means of evolution.
The tendency to revert to substance is the cause of evolution. And this,
because the instant the centrifugal mode begins to act, that instant its
derivative, the centripetal, begins also to exercise its influence.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

\[paragraph continues\] And no sooner has the primordial Arche assumed
the condition of matter, than matter itself begins to differentiate,
actuated by the inherent force of psychic energy, and by differentiation
begets individuals without number.

Then Psyche, once impersonal because essential, becomes individuated and
personal, and through the gate of matter issues forth into new life. A
tiny spark in the globule, Psyche becomes a refulgent blaze in the
globe. And this by continual accretion and centralisation. As along a
chain of nerve-cells the current of magnetic energy flows to its central
point--being conveyed, as is a mechanical shock, along a series of units
in contiguity--with ever culminating impetus, so is the psychic energy
throughout nature developed. Hence the necessity of centres, of
associations, of organisms. Thus, by the systematisation of congeries of
living entities, that which in each is little becomes great in the
whole. For the quality of Psyche is ever the same, and her potentiality
is invariable.

I have spoken of an outer personality and of an inner personality; of a
material consciousness as differing from a spiritual consciousness. So
now, in like manner, I speak of a spiritual energy as differing from a
material energy. The energy whereby Psyche polarises and accretes is not
dependent on the undulations of ether, as are material energies. For
Psyche is the essence of the ether itself. All manifested life is a
process of burning. Psyche is the substance of the medium by which the
burning is conditioned. The first state of matter is ether. But Psyche
is within and before the ether. Therefore is she rightly termed
immaculate. And to the first state of matter corresponds a first mode of
force, that is *rotatory*, the centrifugal and centripetal in one. But
before and within force is will;--that is Necessity. Necessity is the
will of God. Now this will is spiritual force. It is inherent in Psyche,
and she is the medium in which it operates. Such, therefore, as the
primordial will is in relation to the primordial substance, such is the
individual will in relation to the derived soul. And when the current of
spiritual energy (or will) is strong enough in the complex organism to
polarise and kindle centrally, then the individual Psyche conceives
divinity in her womb, and becomes God-conscious. In the rudimentary
stages of matter this current is not strong enough, or continuous
enough, thus to polarise.

Psyche, when once she has gathered force enough to burn centrally, is
not quenched by the disintegration of the physical

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

elements. These, indeed, fall asunder and desquamate many times during
life, whether it be the life of an individual or the life of a system;
yet the consciousness and memory remain the same. Thou hast not in thy
physical body a single particle that thou hadst fifteen years since, yet
thou art the same Ego, and thy thought is continuous. Thy Psyche,
therefore, has grown up out of many elements; and in thine Ego their
interior Egos are perpetuated, because their psychic force is
centralised in thine individuality. And when thy Psyche passes forth
from the disintegrating particles of thy physical body, these shall
build up new material entities, and the reversion of matter to substance
shall still continue. And thy substantial part shall go forth to new
affinities.

"But," thou sayest, "if soul be immaculate, how comes she to be
attracted by material affinities?"

The link between her and earth is Karma. Not until she is permeated
throughout her essence by spirit, is she able to rise above the astral
influences. Remember that the science of theosophy is a science of
vehicles. Soul is the highest of these vehicles. But the spirit is the
first and last term. Immaculate though she be in her virginal essence,
she is not the espoused bride until the bond between her and earth be
severed. And this can only be when every molecule of her essence is
pervaded by spirit, and indissolubly married therewith, as God with
Arche in the Principle.

"But," thou sayest, "there are foul and horrible forms;--have these also
an immaculate Psyche?"

These have a Psyche overwhelmed by her Karma, because of her feebleness.
Either increase or decrease is the portion of the soul. "He that
gathereth not with me, scattereth." Then, when the celestial is weak and
divided, the astral and material are strong.

"But," thou sayest, "if soul be thus a resultant of polarisation
occurring in the organism she animates, how can soul pass from one body
to another by re-incarnation? Surely soul is formed anew in every body
and cannot undergo transmigration?"

Do not confuse between substance and force. Substance is Psyche, the
medium. Force is Spirit, the energy. That which burns in a flame is gas;
the process of burning is a mode or condition of the gas. That which is
burnt is fuel, or matter, in which the gas is generated. And when thou
askest, "How can the [Psyche](errata.htm#1.md), which is generated in one
body, pass by transmigration

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

to another?" it is as though thou askedst, "How can the flame generated
in one log of wood pass to another?" The dispensation of physical series
may be compared to a furnace into which are cast in succession many
faggots. In each faggot is a certain amount of unburnt gas and of latent
energy; because there is no medium without inherent force. This latent
or inherent force is capacity. (A living medium need not always be
active, but it must retain the capacity of action. God need not always
be creating, but God must always retain the capacity of creating.) As by
the burning the gas of each faggot is consumed, the elements of the
faggot (in each of which is stored a certain proportion of this gas)
disintegrate and fall into ash. Then another faggot catches the flame
and continues it without solution, supplying in the same way the
necessary medium. But observe that Psyche is not "generated in a body,"
neither is flame generated in a faggot. But for fuel there could be no
flame, and but for matter there could be no Psyche. That which really is
"generated" in the fuel, is the gas by means of which flame becomes
manifest. And that which really is generated in the body, is the
condition by means of which Psyche abstract becomes Psyche concrete.
