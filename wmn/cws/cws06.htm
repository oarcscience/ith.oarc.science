<P>I HEARD last night in my sleep a voice speaking to me, and saying--</P>
<P>1. You ask the method and nature of Inspiration, and the means whereby God revealeth the Truth.</P>
<P>2. Know that there is no enlightenment from without: the secret of things is revealed from within.</P>
<P>3. From without cometh no Divine Revelation: but the Spirit within beareth witness.</P>
<P>4. Think not I tell you that which you know not: for except you know it, it cannot be given to you.</P>
<P>5. To him that hath it is given, and he hath the more abundantly.</P>
<P>6. None is a prophet save he who knoweth: the instructor of the people is a man of many lives.</P>
<P>7. Inborn knowledge and the perception of things, these are the sources of revelation: the soul of the man instructeth him, having already learned by experience.</P>
<P>8. Intuition is inborn experience; that which the soul knoweth of old and of former years.</P>
<P>9. And Illumination is the Light of Wisdom, whereby a man perceiveth heavenly secrets.</P>
<P>10. Which Light is the Spirit of God within the man, showing unto him the things of God.</P>
<P>11. Do not think that I tell you anything you know not; all cometh from within: the Spirit that informeth is the Spirit of God in the prophet.</P>
<P>12. What, then, you ask, is the <I>Medium</I>; and how are to be regarded the utterances of one speaking in trance?</P>
<P>13. God speaketh through no man in the way you suppose; for the Spirit of the Prophet beholdeth God with open eyes. If he fall into a trance, his eyes are open, and his interior man knoweth what is spoken by him.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></P>
<P>14. But when a man speaketh that which he knoweth not, he is obsessed: an impure spirit, or one that is bound, hath entered into him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>15. There are many such, but their words are as the words of men who know not: these are not prophets nor inspired.</P>
<P>16. God obsesseth no man; God is revealed: and he to whom God is revealed speaketh that which he knoweth.</P>
<P>17. Christ Jesus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> understandeth God: he knoweth that of which he beareth witness.</P>
<P>18. But they who, being mediums, utter in trance things of which they have no knowledge, and of which their own spirit is uninformed: these are obsessed with a spirit of divination, a strange spirit, not their own.</P>
<P>19. Of such beware, for they speak many lies, and are deceivers, working often for gain or for pleasure sake: and they are a grief and a snare to the faithful.</P>
<P>20. Inspiration may indeed be mediumship, but it is conscious; and the knowledge of the prophet instructeth him.</P>
<P>21. Even though he speak in an ecstasy, he uttereth nothing that he knoweth not.</P>
<P>22. Thou who art a prophet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> hast had many lives: yea, thou hast taught many nations, and hast stood before kings.</P>
<P>23. And God hath instructed thee in the years that are past; and in the former times of the earth.</P>
<P>24. By prayer, by fasting, by meditation, by painful seeking, hast thou attained that thou knowest.</P>
<P>25. There is no knowledge but by labour; there is no intuition but by experience.</P>
<P>26. I have seen thee on the hills of the East: I have followed thy steps in the wilderness: I have seen thee adore at sunrise: I have marked thy night watches in the caves of the mountains.</P>
<P>
.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A></P>
<P>27. Thou hast attained with patience, O prophet! God hath revealed the truth to thee from within.</P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">PART 2</H4>
<I><P ALIGN="CENTER">A Prophecy of the Kingdom of the Soul, mystically called the Day of the Woman</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>1. And now I show you a mystery and a new thing, which is part of the mystery of the fourth day of creation.</P>
<P>2. The word which shall come to save the world, shall be uttered by a woman.</P>
<P>3. A woman shall conceive, and shall bring forth the tidings of salvation.</P>
<P>4. For the reign of Adam is at its last hour; and God shall crown all things by the creation of Eve.</P>
<P>5. Hitherto the man hath been alone, and hath had dominion over the earth.</P>
<P>6. But when the woman shall be created, God shall give unto her the kingdom; and she shall be first in rule and highest in dignity.</P>
<P>7. Yea, the last shall be first; and the elder shall serve the younger.</P>
<P>8. So that women shall no more lament for their womanhood: but men shall rather say, "O that we had been born women!"</P>
<P>9. For the strong shall be put down from their seat; and the meek shall be exalted to their place.</P>
<P>10. The days of the covenant of manifestation are passing away: the gospel of interpretation cometh.</P>
<P>11. There shall nothing new be told; but that which is ancient shall be interpreted.</P>
<P>12. So that man the manifestor shall resign his office; and woman the interpreter shall give light to the world.</P>
<P>13. Hers is the fourth office: she revealeth that which the Lord hath manifested.</P>
<P>14. Hers is the light of the heavens, and the brightest of the planets of the holy seven.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A></P>
<P>15. She is the fourth dimension; the eyes which enlighten; the power which draweth inward to God.</P>
<P>16. And her kingdom cometh; the day of the exaltation of woman.</P>
<P>17. And her reign shall be greater than the reign of the man; for Adam shall be put down from his place; and she shall have dominion for ever.</P>
<P>18. And she who is alone shall bring forth more children to God than she who hath an husband.</P>
<P>19. There shall no more be a reproach against women: but against men shall be the reproach.</P>
<P>20. For the woman is the crown of man, and the final manifestation of humanity.</P>
<P>21. She is the nearest to the throne of God, when she shall be revealed.</P>
<P>22. But the creation of woman is not yet complete: but it shall be complete in the time which is at hand.</P>
<P>23. All things are thine, O Mother of God: all things are thine, O Thou who risest from the sea; and Thou shalt have dominion over all the worlds.</P>
