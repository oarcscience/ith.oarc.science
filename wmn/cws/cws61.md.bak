### No. V

#### CONCERNING THE "GREAT WORK," THE REDEMPTION, AND THE SHARE OF CHRIST JESUS THEREIN <span id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_196.md)

"FOR this cause is Christ manifest, that he may destroy the works of the
devil."

2\. In this text of the holy writings is contained the explanation of
the mission of the Christ, and the nature of the Great Work.

3\. Now the devil, or old serpent, the enemy of God, is that which gives
pre-eminence to matter.

4\. He is disorder, confusion, distortion, falsification, error. He is
not personal, he is not positive, he is not formulated. Whatever God is,
that the devil is not.

5\. God is light, truth, order, harmony, reason: and God's works are
illumination, knowledge, understanding, love, and sanity.

6\. Therefore the devil is darkness, falsehood, disorder, discord,
ignorance; and his works are confusion, folly, division, hatred and
delirium.

7\. The devil is therefore the negation of God's Positive. God is I AM:
the devil is NOT. He has no individuality and no existence; for he
represents the not-being. Wherever God's kingdom is not, the devil
reigns.

8\. Now the Great Work is the redemption of spirit from matter; that is,
the establishment of the kingdom of God.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

9\. Jesus being asked when the kingdom of God should come, answered,
"When Two shall be as One, and that which is Without as that which is
Within." <span id="fr_197"></span>[1](#fn_197.md)

10\. In saying this, he expressed the nature of the Great Work. The Two
are spirit and matter: the within is the real invisible; the without is
the illusory visible.

11\. The kingdom of God shall come when spirit and matter shall be one
substance, and the phenomenal shall be absorbed into the real.

12\. His design was therefore to destroy the dominion of matter, and to
dissipate the devil and his works.

13\. And this he intended to accomplish by proclaiming the knowledge of
the Universal Dissolvent, and giving to men the keys of the kingdom of
God.

14\. Now, the kingdom of God is within us; that is, it is interior,
invisible, mystic, spiritual.

15\. There is a power by means of which the outer may be absorbed into
the inner.

16\. There is a power by means of which matter may be ingested into its
original substance.

17\. He who possesses this power is Christ, and he has the devil under
foot.

18\. For he reduces chaos to order, and indraws the external to the
centre.

19\. He has learnt that matter is illusion, and that spirit alone is
real.

20\. He has found his own central point: and all power is given unto him
in heaven and on earth.

21\. Now, the central point is the number thirteen: it is the number of
the marriage of the Son of God.

22\. And all the members of the microcosm are bidden to the banquet of
the marriage.

23\. But if there chance to be even one among them which has not on a
wedding garment,

24\. Such a one is a traitor, and the microcosm is found divided against
itself.

25\. And that it may be wholly regenerate, it is necessary that Judas be
cast out.

26\. Now the members of the microcosm are twelve: of the senses three,
of the mind three, of the heart three, and of the conscience three.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

27\. For of the body there are four elements; and the sign of the four
is sense, in the which are three gates;

28\. The gate of the eye, the gate of the ear, and the gate of
touch. <span id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_198.md)

29\. Renounce vanity, and be poor: renounce praise, and be humble:
renounce luxury, and be chaste.

30\. Offer unto God a pure oblation: let the fire of the altar search
thee, and prove thy fortitude.

31\. Cleanse thy sight, thine hands, and thy feet: carry the censer of
thy worship into the courts of the Lord; and let thy vows be unto the
Most High.

32\. And for the magnetic man <span id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_199.md)
there are four elements: and the covering of the four is mind, in the
which are three gates;

33\. The gate of desire, the gate of labour, and the gate of
illumination.

34\. Renounce the world, and aspire heavenward: labour not for the meat
which perishes, but ask of God thy daily bread: beware of wandering
doctrines, and let the Word of the Lord be thy light.

35\. Also of the soul there are four elements: and the seat of the four
is the heart, whereof likewise there are three gates:

36\. The gate of obedience, the gate of prayer, and the gate of
discernment.

37\. Renounce thine own will, and let the law of God only be within
thee: renounce doubt: pray always and faint not: be pure of heart also,
and thou shalt see God.

38\. And within the soul is the Spirit: and the Spirit is One, yet has
it likewise three elements.

39\. And these are the gates of the oracle of God, which is the ark of
the covenant:

40\. The rod, the host, <span id="fr_200"></span>[3](#fn_200.md) and the
law:

41\. The force which solves, and transmutes, and divines: the bread of
heaven which is the substance of all things and the food of angels; the
table of the law, which is the will of God, written with the finger of
the Lord.

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

42\. If these three be within thy spirit, then shall the Spirit of God
be within thee.

43\. And the glory shall be upon the propitiatory, in the holy place of
thy prayer.

44\. These are the twelve gates of regeneration: through which if a man
enter he shall have right to the tree of life.

45\. For the number of that tree is thirteen.

46\. It may happen to a man to have three, to another five, to another
seven, to another ten.

47\. But until a man have twelve, he is not master over the last enemy.

48\. Therefore was Jesus betrayed to death by Judas: because he was not
yet perfected.

49\. But he was perfected through suffering: yea, by the passion, the
cross, and the burial.

50\. For he could not wholly die: neither could his body see corruption.

51\. So he revived: for the elements of death were not in his flesh; and
his molecules retained the polarity of life eternal.

52\. He therefore was raised and became perfect: having the power of the
dissolvent and of transmutation.

53\. And God glorified the Son of Man: yea, he ascended into heaven, and
sits at the right hand of the Majesty on high.

54\. Thence also the Christ shall come again: in power like unto the
power of his ascension.

55\. For as yet the devil is undissipated: the Virgin indeed has crushed
his head; but still he lies in wait for her heel.

56\. Therefore the Great Work is yet to be accomplished.

57\. When the leaven shall have leavened the whole lump; when the seed
shall have become a tree; when the net shall have gathered all things
into it.

58\. For in the same power and glory he had at his ascension, shall
Christ Jesus be manifested from heaven before angels and men.

59\. For when the cycle of the creation is completed, whether of the
macrocosm, or of the microcosm, the Great Work is accomplished.

60\. Six for the manifestation, and six for the interpretation: six for
the outgoing, and six for the ingathering: six for the man, and six for
the woman.

61\. Then shall be the Sabbath of the Lord God. <span
