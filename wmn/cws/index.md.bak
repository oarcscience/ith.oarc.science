------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anna Kingsford was an extraordinary 19th Century woman. She was one of
the first women in Britain to become a medical doctor, edited a feminist
newspaper, and served as president of the Theosophical Society. She knew
Helena P. Blatavsky, Eliphas Levi, and many other primary figures in
Occult and Esoteric circles of the time. She was a principled vegetarian
and anti-vivisectionist, and opposed foxhunting. She was considered one
of the inspirations for the Golden Dawn, a ritual magic secret society
which was one of the sources of modern neo-paganism, although she did
not live to join it. In particular, the equality of the sexes in the
Golden Dawn is acknowledged as her contribution.

Anna Kingsford claimed to be in contact with fairies as a child. As an
adult she had channeled visions, both waking and in lucid dreams, in
which she tapped esoteric knowledge imparted by angelic beings,
travelled in time, and witnessed shamanistic visions of a vast cosmos
alive at every scale of creation. These 'illuminations', as she called
them, were exhausting and sometimes terrifying. Her close collaborator
Edward Maitland worked with Kingsford to record her illuminations in
this book, published after her death.

Much of the channeled and revealed literature of the 19th Century is
surreal fantasy, invented pseudo-histories, or pure free-association. By
contrast, Anna Kingsford's illuminations are consistent, coherent, and
display a deep understanding of occult traditions. Her theology could be
described as Gnostic Christian Polytheist. She had a radical feminist
viewpoint which seems fresh even today, one in which a Goddess figure,
the 'Sophia' of the Essenes, Gnostics and early Christians has a central
role:

> For the woman is the crown of man, and the final manifestation of
> humanity.  
> She is the nearest to the throne of God, when she shall be revealed.  
> But the creation of woman is not yet complete: but it shall be
> complete in the time which is at hand.  
> All things are thine, O Mother of God: all things are thine, O Thou
> who risest from the sea; and Thou shalt have dominion over all the
> worlds.  

Kingsford was chronically ill her entire life; she died of complications
from pneumonia at the early age of 42, on February 22nd 1888.
