### No. XXXVIII

#### CONCERNING THE DOCTRINE OF GRACE <span id="fr_156"></span>[4](#fn_156.md)

ONE of the most dangerous mysteries to place in the hands of the vulgar
is that of the doctrine of grace. When once union has been accomplished
between the human and the divine wills, there is grace. And the man
under grace cannot sin mortally. Conformity between the human and the
divine wills is the condition of salvation, and salvation is not
forfeited through any specific act, unless such act be wilful and
indicate a condition of rebellion.

Of a man under grace, David is a type. His heart was right with God; his
intuition was unfallen. So that even his many and grievous sins did not,
and could not, alienate him from God. The man who is deliberately in
opposition to the divine will is in far greater danger than the man who,
having a true intuition,

sins more flagrantly. It is not by a specific act, or many specific
acts, that the soul is destroyed; but by a state of heart in constant
opposition to the divine will. Hence the axiom of the Calvinist, "If you
are under grace you cannot sin"--that is, mortally.

\*<sub>\*</sub>\* Whence one reason for the appellation "Son of David"
applied to the Christ. The man must first be "under grace" before he can
become regenerate. It is an indispensable step in his soul's progress.
Wherefore the latter is said to be the son of the former.
