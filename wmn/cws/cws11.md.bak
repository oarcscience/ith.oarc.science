### No. VII

#### CONCERNING THE FALL <span id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57.md)

THE friend with whom I was staying having asked me to obtain for her, if
possible, while in her house a precise and practical instruction on this
subject, I found myself surrounded in my sleep by a group of spirits,
who conversed together upon it evidently for my benefit. They began by
saying that all the mistakes made about the Bible arise out of the
mystic books being referred to times, places, persons, and things <span
id="fr_58"></span>[2](#fn_58.md) material, instead of being regarded as
containing only eternal verities about things spiritual. The opening
chapters of the sacred books, they said, exhibit the meaning and object
of religion, and the method of salvation. They are an epitome of the
whole Bible, a kind of argument prefixed to the divine drama of the
spiritual history of man.

The key to their interpretation is to be found in the word *Now*. There
is no past in the Divine Mind, no future in the Divine Economy. To each
is one thing forbidden under penalty of death. This one thing is
disobedience to the Divine Will. Death is the natural and inevitable
result of rebellion against the Central Will, which is the Tree of Life.
Death ensues in the body when the central will of the system no longer
binds in harmony the

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

component elements of the body. And death ensues in the soul when it is
no longer desirous of union with the Divine Will. Wherefore disobedience
and rebellion are death. But to desire ardently that which God wills,
and to give oneself even to the death to fulfil God's Will, is life. For
"he who will find his life shall lose it"; which means that he who seeks
his own in opposition to the Divine Will, shall perish. "And he who
loses his life shall find it"; which means that he who giveth himself to
the death to fulfil the Divine Will, shall have--nay, already
hath--eternal life.

Now, the injunction laid on every human soul is, not to disobey the
Divine Will. For, in the day that the soul wilfully opposes itself to
God, she shall surely die. This means that the natural death or
dissolution of the body shall, in such case, entail the dissolution and
dispersion of the soul. For the Divine Breath, or Spirit, is the central
life of the human soul, or true man; and if the elements of this
personality be no longer bound in obedience to the Divine Fire, they
will become dissolved and dispersed in the void, and so the individual
perish. "Dying, thou shalt die." The rebellious Adam hath not eternal
life. Death in the body is for him death in the soul. The soul is a
purer and finer essence than the mere matter of the body. But when she
is rebellious, and her elements are no longer bound to their central
fire, they continue, after the death of the body, to disunite and
disintegrate, until, at length, the Holy Spirit being withdrawn, the
soul dissolves into the void and is no more. This is eternal death. On
the other hand, the soul redeemed by obedience to the Divine Will,
withdraws itself, and aspires ever more and more to its centre,
until--absorbed therein--it becomes like unto God, wholly spiritual.
This is eternal life.

Now, "the Gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord."
"For, as in the earthly and rebellious Adam we die; so in the Christ we
are made alive for evermore." That is, that inasmuch as by disobedience
to the Divine Will the soul brings on itself dissolution and eternal
death; so, when it is regenerate and strives continually to attain the
Christ nature, it obtains thereby eternal life. For it arises
necessarily out of the law of the universe that nothing can continue to
exist which is out of harmony with the Divine Central Will. Now, the
nature which is in most perfect harmony with the Divine Will is the
Christ-nature. Wherefore, of the redeemed universe the perfect chord is,
Thy Will be done.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

But had it been permitted to the rebellious and fallen Adam, after his
act of disobedience in plucking and eating of the forbidden fruit, to
"put forth his hand and take also of the Tree of Life, and to live for
ever," the result would have been an eternal hell. For then the soul
would have continued to exist for ever while in a state of separation by
disobedience from God, and while insulting and defying God. Such
division of the universe against itself would have involved its
destruction--a catastrophe which can by no possibility occur. And the
condition would have involved the soul in a perpetual hell of misery;
wherefore, in merciful arrest of such a doom, God drove out the fallen
soul from the reach of eternal life. But even while doing so, God
pronounced the words of hope and redemption. For with the curse comes
the promise, "Adam falling, Christ redeems."

For the soul, having accomplished the act of disobedience, has its "eyes
opened." And it now perceives that alone and divorced from the Divine
Will it is "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked," as
said of the Church of Laodicea in the Apocalypse; and Adam, knowing he
is fallen, "hides" himself. For apart from God, Who is its life, the
soul is nothing. And this knowledge of her shameful condition is all the
soul gains by rebellion. And so the lesson to the soul is this:--If thou
disunite thyself from God and make thy desire earthwards, thou art as
the dust of the ground, and must die the death of the body. But if thou
desire only God, and make God's law thy will, and its accomplishment thy
delight, thou becomest as God, and hast eternal life.

Referred to in *Life of Anna Kingsford*, vol. i, p. 369.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[17:2](cws11.htm#fr_58.md) In the First Edition the
word "things" was, inadvertently, omitted from the text, and the passage
read: "places and persons material." This is confirmed by E. M.'s
quotation from this Illumination in the *Life of Anna Kingsford* (vol.
i, p. 369), which includes the word "things."    S. H. H.
