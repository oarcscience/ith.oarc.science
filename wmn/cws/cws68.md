### No. XII

#### ZETA, OR THE SECOND OF THE GODS

##### PART I

Proem

AND the Spirit of Wisdom gave counsel, whose is the angel of the
innermost sphere, the brightest of the sons of heaven.

2\. Lord Adonai, who createst, remember the souls beneath Thine
altar. <span id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_209.md)

3\. And put a firmament between them and Thee, to divide the upper from
the nether, and the inner from the without.

4\. And whereas there hath been but one, let there henceforth be twain,
the form and the substance, the apparent and the real;

5\. That they who are bound may remain in the outer element.

6\. But to me Thou committest thine only begotten, who shall enter
within the veil.

7\. And God made a firmament in the midst of all being, and divided the
spirit from the body.

8\. And the firmament is the gate of the kingdom of heaven.

9\. And God gave the keys thereof to the angel of the second sphere,
whose spirit is the Spirit of Understanding.

10\. He is Hermes, the mediator, for he mediates between the outer and
the inner.

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

11\. He is the transmuter and the healer, Raphael the physician of
souls.

12\. There is no riddle he shall not solve for thee, nor any solid he
shall not melt, nor any wall he shall not pass through.

13\. Many are his states and his aspects; his weight is as lead, he
runneth like water, he is light as the mist of dawn.

14\. Yet he is as a rock between earth and heaven, and the Lord God
shall build his Church thereon;\[F\]

15\. As a city upon a mountain of stone, whose windows look forth on
either side.

16\. And upon the left are the kingdoms of the world and the shapes of
illusion; and upon the right are the heights of heaven and the kingdom
of spirit.

17\. And to him are committed the keys of the invisible, and of the Holy
of Holies within the veil.

18\. Whatsoever soul he shall bind, shall be bound in the outer and the
nether.

19\. And whatsoever soul he shall loose, shall be loosed in the inner
and the upper.

20\. He shutteth and no man openeth; he setteth free and none shall bind
again.

21\. And his number is the number of twain; he is the angel of the
twofold states. <span id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_210.md)

22\. And the waters below and above the firmament, are the evening and
the morning of the second day.\[G\]

Hymn to Hermes <span id="fr_211"></span>[2](#fn_211.md)

1\. As a moving light between heaven and earth; as a white cloud
assuming many shapes;

2\. He descends and rises, he guides and illumines, he transmutes
himself from small to great, from bright to shadowy, from the opaque
image to the diaphanous mist.

3\. Star of the East conducting the Magi: cloud from whose midst the
holy voice speaketh: by day a pillar of vapour, by night a shining
flame.

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

4\. I behold thee, Hermes, Son of God, slayer of Argus,\[H\] archangel,
who bearest the rod of knowledge, by which all things in heaven or on
earth are measured.

5\. Double serpents entwine it, because as serpents they must be wise
who desire God.'

6\. And upon thy feet are living wings, bearing thee fearless through
space and over the abyss of darkness; because they must be without dread
to dare the void and. the deep, who desire to attain and to achieve.

7\. Upon thy side thou wearest a sword of a single stone, two-edged,
whose temper resisteth all things.

8\. For they who would slay or save must be armed with a strong and
perfect will, defying and penetrating with no uncertain force.

9\. This is Herpe, the sword which destroyeth demons; by whose aid the
hero overcometh, and the saviour is able to deliver.

10\. Except thou bind it upon thy thigh thou shalt be overborne, and
blades of mortal making shall prevail against thee.

11\. Nor is this all thine equipment, Son of God; the covering of
darkness is upon thine head, and none is able to strike thee.

12\. This is the magic hat, brought from Hades, the region of silence,
where they are who speak not.

13\. He who bears the world on his shoulders shall give it to thee, lest
the world fall on thee, and thou be ground into powder.\[J\]

14\. For he who has perfect wisdom and knowledge, he whose steps are
without fear, and whose will is single and all-pervading;

15\. Even he must also know how to keep the divine secret, and not to
expose the holy mysteries of God to the senses of the wicked.

16\. Keep a bridle upon thy lips, and, cover thy head in the day of
battle.

17\. These are the four excellent things,--the rod, the wings, the
sword, and the hat.

18\. Knowledge, which thou must gain with labour: the spirit of holy
boldness, which cometh by faith in God; a mighty will, and a complete
discretion.

19\. He who discovers <span id="fr_212"></span>[1](#fn_212.md) the holy
mysteries is lost.

20\. Go thy way in silence, and see thou tell no man.

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

##### PART 2

An Exhortation of Hermes to his Neophytes <span
id="fr_213"></span>[1](#fn_213.md)

I. He whose adversaries fight with weapons of steel, must himself be
armed in like manner, if he would not be ignominiously slain or save
himself by flight.

2\. And not only so, but forasmuch as his adversaries may be many, while
he is only one; it is even necessary that the steel he carries be of
purer temper and of more subtle point and contrivance than theirs.

3\. 1, Hermes, would arm you with such, that bearing a blade with a
double edge, ye may be able to withstand in the evil hour.

4\. For it is written that the tree of life is guarded by a sword which
turneth every way.

5\. Therefore I would have you armed both with a perfect philosophy and
with the power of the divine life.

6\. And first the knowledge; that you and they who hear you may know the
reason of the faith which is in you.

7\. But knowledge cannot prevail alone, and ye are not yet perfected.

8\. When the fulness of the time shall come, I will add unto you the
power of the divine life.

9\. It is the life of contemplation, of fasting, of obedience, and of
resistance.

10\. And afterwards the chrism, the power, and the glory. But these are
not yet.

11\. Meanwhile remain together and perfect your philosophy.

12\. Boast not, and be not lifted up; for all things are God's, and ye
are in God, and God in you.

13\. But when the word shall come to you, be ready to obey.

14\. There is but one way to power, and it is the way of obedience.

15\. Call no man your master or king upon the earth, lest ye forsake the
spirit for the form and become idolaters. <span
id="fr_214"></span>[2](#fn_214.md)

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

16\. He who is indeed spiritual, and transformed into the divine image,
desires a spiritual king.

17\. Purify your bodies, and eat no dead thing that has looked with
living eyes upon the light of Heaven.

18\. For the eye is the symbol of brotherhood among you. Sight is the
mystical sense.

19\. Let no man take the life of his brother to feed withal his own.

20\. But slay only such as are evil; in the name of the Lord.

21\. They are miserably deceived who expect eternal life, and restrain
not their hands from blood and death.

22\. They are miserably deceived who look for wives from on high, and
have not yet attained their manhood.

23\. Despise not the gift of knowledge; and make not spiritual eunuchs
of yourselves.

24\. For Adam -was first formed, then Eve.

25\. Ye are twain, the man with the woman, <span
id="fr_215"></span>[1](cws69.htm#fn_215.md) and she with him, neither man
nor woman, but one creature.

26\. And the kingdom of God is within you.\[K\]
