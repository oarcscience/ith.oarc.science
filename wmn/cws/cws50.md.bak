### No. XLVI

#### CONCERNING CONSCIOUSNESS AND MEMORY IN RELATION TO PERSONALITY <span id="fr_178"></span>[1](#fn_178.md)

CONSCIOUSNESS is not so much a thing as a condition. Now, if thou
wouldst have a clear conception of that condition by means of analogy,
take as an illustration the image of an incandescent globe,--a ball of
fire, fluid and igneous throughout its whole mass. <span
id="fr_179"></span>[2](#fn_179.md) Divide this globe in thought into
several successive zones, each containing its precedent. Thou wilt find
that the central interior zone only contains the radiant point, or heart
of the fiery mass, and that each successive zone constitutes a
circumferential halo more or less intense, according to its nearness to
the radiant point, but secondary and derived only and not in itself a
source of luminous radiation.

It is thus with the macrocosm and thus also with the human kingdom. In
the latter the soul is the interior zone, and it alone contains the
radiant point. By this one indivisible effulgence, the successive zones
are illuminated in unbroken continuity; but the source of this
effulgence is not in them. I call this effulgence consciousness, and
this radiant point the spiritual ego or divine spark. Now, for all
things there is one law. God is nothing that man is not. Man, therefore,
is one. But within this unity is plurality. God being one, is yet three;
for in one personality are three persons. And not only three; for God is
beyond number, being all that *is*. So that in this divine unity are
many comprehended personalities. This is because spirit is in its very
essence consciousness, and wherever spirit is there is consciousness.
Yet all spirit is one. Wherefore consciousness is one. And as spirit is
manifold, so consciousness is manifold. And spirit, like light, is
diffusive. Were it otherwise there could be no universe, but only one
point spreading no rays, and instead, thick darkness and unconsciousness
throughout eternity. But this is absurd

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

and against reason; because it is the very nature of light to be
radiant; and radiance is itself light; so that wherever light is there
is radiance or shining; and God is the Shining One, or radiant point of
the universe. God is the supreme consciousness, and the divine radiance
is also consciousness. And man's interior ego is conscient only because
the radiant point in it is divine. But this consciousness emits
consciousness, and transmits it, first to the *anima bruta*, and last to
the physical body. But the more concentrated the consciousness, the
brighter and more effulgent the central spark. It is erroneous to think
of consciousness as non-diffusive, precisely as it would be to think of
light as non-radiant. But it is true that consciousness hath a centre of
diffusion, as light hath a radiant point.

Now, if from the midst of this imagined globe of fire thou take the
central incandescent spark, the whole globe does not immediately become
dark, but the effulgence lingers in each zone according to its degree of
nearness to the centre of the sphere. It is thus also when dissolution
occurs in the process of death. Everything is conscious according to its
proper degree. In somnambulism either the *anima bruta* and the physical
body are conscious while the consciousness of the soul is suspended; or
the reverse occurs, according to the kind of somnolence induced. But
that part which remains conscious is capable of reflection, of thought,
of memory, and even of intelligent invention and acumen, according to
its kind and its endowments. Consciousness is, therefore, diffusive and,
in a certain sense, divisible. He best comprehends this truth who is
nearest and most like to God; and such an one is the poet.

Thou knowest that in the end, when Nirvâna is attained, the soul shall
gather up all that it hath left within the astral of holy memories and
worthy experience, and to this end the Ruach rises in the astral sphere,
by the gradual decay and loss of its more material affinities, until
these have so disintegrated and perished, that its substance is thereby
lightened and purified. But continual commerce and intercourse with
earth add, as it were, fresh fuel to its earthly affinities, keeping
these alive and hindering its recall to its spiritual ego. Thus,
therefore, the spiritual ego itself is detained from perfect absorption
into the divine, and union therewith. For the Ruach shall not all die,
if there be in it anything worthy of recall. The astral sphere is its
purging chamber. For Saturn, who is Time, is the trier of all things; he
devoureth all the dross; only that escapeth which in its nature is

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

ethereal and destined to reign. And this death of the Ruach is gradual
and natural. It is a process of elimination and disintegration,
often--as men measure time-extending over many decades, or even
centuries. And those Ruachs which appertain to wicked and evil persons,
having strong wills, inclined earthwards,--these persist longest and
manifest most frequently and vividly, because they *rise not*, but,
being destined to perish utterly, are not withdrawn from immediate
contact with the earth. They are all dross; there is in them no
redeemable element. But the Ruach of the righteous complaineth if thou
disturb his evolution. "Why callest thou me? disturb me not. The
memories of my earth-life are chains about my neck; the desire of the
past detaineth me. Suffer me to rise towards my rest, and hinder me not
with evocations. But let thy love go after me and encompass me; so shalt
thou rise with me through sphere after sphere."

For the good man upon earth can love nothing less than the divine.
Wherefore that which he loveth in his friend is the divine, that is, the
true and radiant self. And if he love it as differentiated from God, it
is only on account of its separate tincture. For in the perfect light
there are innumerable tinctures. And according to its celestial
affinity, one soul loveth this or that splendour more than the rest. And
when the righteous friend of the good man dieth, the love of the living
man goeth after the true soul of the dead; and the strength and divinity
of this love helpeth the purgation of the astral soul, the psychic
ghost. It is to this astral soul, which ever remaineth near the living
friend, an indication of the way it must also go,--a light shining upon
the upward path that leads from the astral to the celestial and
everlasting. For love, being divine, is *towards* the divine. "Love
exalteth, love purifieth, love uplifteth."

There is but one God; and in God are comprehended all thrones, and
dominions, and powers, and principalities, and archangels, and cherubim
in the celestial world. And through these are all the worlds begotten in
time and space, each with its astral sphere. Now, all these, both
terrene and heavenly, are conscient entities, yet all subsist in one
consciousness, which is one God. Because all things are of spirit, and
God is spirit, and spirit is consciousness. The material of the physical
brain is constituted of countless cells and innumerable connecting
fibres, and each cell hath its own consciousness, according to its
degree. Yet the resultant of all these concordant functions is one
perception and one consciousness. <span id="page_116">p. 116</span>
There is also a consciousness of the nerves, and another of the blood,
and another of the tissues. There is a consciousness of the eye, and
another of the ear, and another of the touch. There is a consciousness
appropriate, and appertaining specially and distinctively, to every
bodily organ. And all these work night and day within the body, each
according to its kind and its order. Yet the intellect of the man
knoweth nothing thereof. Interrogate one of these living organs, and it
will answer thee after its kind. If man, then, can so little dominate
and direct the divers parts of his own physical body, why should he find
it strange that his ethereal self be likewise similarly multiple? The
*anima bruta* is as an organ of the spiritual man; and though it be part
of him, its acts, its functions, and its consciousness are not identical
with those of the spiritual soul. Consciousness is divisible, therefore,
and diffusible in man, as in God; in the planet, as in the universe; and
one law is throughout all.
