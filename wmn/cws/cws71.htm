<P>AND on the seventh day there went forth from the presence of God a mighty angel, full of wrath and consuming, and God gave unto him the dominion of the outermost sphere.</P>
<P>2. Eternity brought forth time; the boundless gave birth to limit; being descended into generation.</P>
<P>3. As lightning I beheld Satan fall from heaven, splendid in strength and fury.</P>
<P>4. Among the Gods is none like unto Him, into whose hand are committed the kingdoms, the power and the glory of the worlds:</P>
<P>5. Thrones and empires, the dynasties of kings, the fall of nations, the birth of churches, the triumphs of time.</P>
<P>6. They arise and pass, they were and are not; the sea and the dust and the immense mystery of space devour them.</P>
<P>7. The tramp of armies, the voices of joy and of pain, the cry of the new-born babe, the shout of the warrior mortally smitten.</P>
<P>8. Marriage, divorce, division, violent deaths, martyrdoms, tyrannous ignorances, the impotence of passionate protest, and the mad longing for oblivion:</P>
<P>9. The eyes of the tiger in the jungle, the fang of the snake, the f&#156;tor of slaughter-houses, the wail of innocent beasts in pain:</P>
<P>10. The innumerable incarnations of spirit, the strife towards manhood, the ceaseless pulse and current of desire:--</P>
<P>11. These are his who beareth all the Gods on his shoulders;[V] who establisheth the pillars of necessity and fate.</P>
<P>12. Many names hath God given him, names of mystery, secret and terrible.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A></P>
<P>13. God called him Satan the Adversary, because matter opposeth spirit, and time accuseth even the saints of the Lord.</P>
<P>14. And the Destroyer, for his arm breaketh and grindeth to pieces; wherefore the fear and the dread of him are upon all flesh.</P>
<P>15. And the Avenger, for he is the anger of God; his breath shall burn up all the souls of the wicked.</P>
<P>16. And the Sifter, for he straineth all things through his sieve, dividing the husk from the grain; discovering the thoughts of the heart; proving and purifying the spirit of man.</P>
<P>17. And the Deceiver, for he maketh the false appear true, and concealeth the real under the mask of illusion.</P>
<P>18. And the Tempter, for he setteth snares before the feet of the elect: he beguileth with vain shows, and seduceth with enchantments.</P>
<P>19. Blessed are they who withstand his subtlety: they shall be called the Sons of God, and shall enter in at the beautiful gates.</P>
<P>20. For Satan is the doorkeeper of the temple of the King: he standeth in Solomon's porch; he holdeth. the keys of the sanctuary;</P>
<P>21. That no man may enter therein save the Anointed, having the arcanum of Hermes.</P>
<P>22. For Satan is the Spirit of the Fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom.</P>
<P>23. He is the devourer of the unwise and the evil: they shall all be meat and drink to him.</P>
<P>24. Whatsoever he devoureth, that shall never more return into being.</P>
<P>25. Fear him, for after he hath killed, he hath power to cast into hell.</P>
<P>26. But he is the servant of the Sons of God, and of the children of light.</P>
<P>27. They shall go before him, and he shall follow the steps of the wise.</P>
<P>28. Stand in awe of him and sin not: speak his name with trembling; and beseech God daily to deliver thee.</P>
<P>29. For Satan is the magistrate of the justice of God: he beareth the balance and the sword,</P>
<P>30. To execute judgment and vengeance upon all who come short of the commandments of God; to weigh their works, to measure their desire, and to number their days,</P>
<P>31. For to him are committed weight and measure and number.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A></P>
<P>32. And all things must pass under the rod and through the balance, and be fathomed by the sounding-lead.</P>
<P>33. Therefore Satan is the minister of God, Lord of the seven mansions of Hades, the angel of the manifest worlds.</P>
<P>34. And God hath put a girdle about his loins, and the name of the girdle is Death.</P>
<P>35. Threefold are its coils, for threefold is the power of Death, dissolving the body, the ghost, and the soul.</P>
<P>36. And that girdle is black within, but where Phoibos strikes it is silver.</P>
<P>37. None of the Gods is girt save Satan, for upon him only is the shame of generation.</P>
<P>38. He hath lost his virginal estate: uncovering heavenly secrets, he hath entered into bondage.</P>
<P>39. He encompasseth with bonds and limits all things which are made: he putteth chains round about the worlds, and determineth their orbits.</P>
<P>40. By him are creation and appearance; by him birth and transformation; the day of begetting and the night of death.</P>
<P>41. The glory of Satan is the shadow of the Lord: the throne of Satan is the footstool of Adonai.</P>
<P>42. Twain are the armies of God: in heaven the hosts of Michael; in the abyss the legions of Satan.</P>
<P>43. These are the unmanifest and the manifest; the free and the bound; the virginal and the fallen.</P>
<P>44. And both are the ministers of the Father, fulfilling the word divine.</P>
<P>45. The legions of Satan are the creative emanations, having the shapes of dragons, of Titans, and of elemental gods;</P>
<P>46. Forsaking the intelligible world,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> seeking manifestation, renouncing their first estate;</P>
<P>47. Which were cast out into chaos, neither was their place found any more in heaven.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">(2)</P>
<P>48. Evil is the result of limitation, and Satan is the Lord of limit.</P>
<P>49. He is the father of lies, because matter is the cause of illusion.</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A></P>
<P>50. To understand the secret of the kingdom of God, and to read the riddle of <I>Maya</I>, this is to have Satan under foot.</P>
<P>51. He only can put Satan under foot who is released by thought from the bonds of desire.</P>
<P>52. Nature is the allegory of spirit: all that appeareth to the sense is deceit: to know the truth,--this alone shall make men free.</P>
<P>53. For the kingdom of Satan is the house of matter: yea, his mansion is the sepulchre of Golgotha, wherein on the seventh day the Lord lay sleeping, keeping the Sabbath of the unmanifest.</P>
<P>54. For the day of Satan is the night of spirit: the manifestation of the worlds of form is the rest of the worlds informulate.</P>
<P>55. Holy and venerable is the Sabbath of God: blessed and sanctified is the name of the angel of Hades;</P>
<P>56. Whom the Anointed shall overcome, rising again from the dead on the first day of the week.</P>
<P>57. For the place of Satan is the bourne of divine impulsion: there is the arrest of the outgoing force; Luza, the station of pause and slumber:</P>
<P>58. Where Jacob lay down and dreamed, beholding the ladder which reached from earth to heaven.</P>
<P>59. For Jacob is the planetary angel Iacchos, the Lord of the body;</P>
<P>60. Who hath left his father's house, and is gone out into a far country.</P>
<P>61. Yet is Luza none other than Bethel; the kingdom of Satan is become the kingdom of God and of His Christ.</P>
<P>62. For there the Anointed awakeneth, arising from sleep, and goeth his way rejoicing;</P>
<P>63. Having seen the vision of God, and beheld the secret of Satan;</P>
<P>64. Even as the Lord arose from the dead and brake the seal of the sepulchre;[V]</P>
<P>65. Which is the portal of heaven, Luza, the house of separation, the place of stony sleep;</P>
<P>66. Where is born the centripetal force, drawing the soul upward and inward to God;</P>
<P>67. Recalling Existence into Being, resuming the kingdoms of matter in spirit;[W]</P>
<P>68. Until Satan return unto his first estate, and enter again into the heavenly obedience;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_173"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 173</FONT></A></P>
<P>69. Having fulfilled the will of the Father, and accomplished his holy ministry,</P>
<P>70. Which was ordained of God before the worlds, for the splendour of the manifest, and for the generation of Christ our Lord;[X]</P>
<P>71. Who shall judge the quick and the dead, putting all things under his feet; whose are the dominion, the power, the glory, and the Amen.[A]</P>
