### No. II

#### THE "LORD'S PRAYER"

being a prayer of the Elect for interior Perfectionment

OUR Father-Mother who art in the upper and the within: Hallowed be Thy
name:

Thy kingdom come:

Thy will be done, in the body as in the spirit:

Give us every day the communion of the mystical bread:

And perfect us in the power of Thy Sons, according as we give ourselves
to perfect others:

And in the hour of temptation deliver us from the hand of Satan.

For Thine are the kingdom, the power, and the glory.

In the life eternal, and in the Amen.\[A\]
