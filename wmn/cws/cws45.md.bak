### No. XLI

#### CONCERNING THE TRUE EGO <span id="fr_163"></span>[1](#fn_163.md)

\[This illumination followed upon a meditation on the following passage
from G. H. Lewes: "The evolution of organisms, like the evolution of
crystals, or of islands and continents, is determined, first, by laws
inherent in the substance evolved; secondly, by relations to the medium
in which the evolution takes place."\]

THERE is a law inherent in the primordial substance of all matter which
obliges all things to evolve after the same mode and manner. The worlds
in the infinite abyss of heaven are in all respects similar to the cells
in vegetable or animal

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

tissue. Their evolution is similar, their distribution similar, and
their mutual relations are similar. Wherefore, by the study of the
natural sciences, the truth may be learnt, not only in regard to these,
but in regard also to the occult sciences; for the facts of the first
are as a mirror to the facts of the last. And just what the spiritual
Ego is to the physical man, is God to the manifest universe,--its
spirit, dwelling in and pervading it; no more, no less.

And as for the souls of the planets, let us enquire awhile what, as an
individual, thou art. Thy soul is constituted of the agglomerate
essences of all the individual consciousnesses composing thy system. It
has, then, grown,--evolving gradually from rudimentary entities,
themselves evolved by polarisation from mineral and gaseous matter. And
these entities combine and coalesce to form higher entities, the
combined forces of their manifold consciousnesses polarising and
centralising so as to form the human soul. In the same way, the souls of
the planets are formed by the agglomeration and combination of the
myriad souls composing them, these souls ranging from the mineral to the
human group, and thus composing the four principles of each planet's
kingdom. Each planetary God is, therefore, not a supernatural,
extraneous personage, but is the sum total of the souls composing the
planet. His physical body is the visible planet and its phenomena. His
astral body and mind are the plant and animal intelligences. His soul is
man's superior reason; and his spirit is divine, being the *Nous* of the
man. And as when we speak of the planet-god, we specially mean that
*Nous*, it is said with truth that our divine part is no other than the
planet-god, in our case Dio-Nysos, the god of the emerald.

And again, such as are all creatures composing the planet to the planet,
such also are the planets to the universe, and, in consequence, such are
the Gods to GOD.

The primordial God is the sum total of all the Gods. The Spirit of God
is the agglomerate essences of all the deities. To pray to God is to
address all the Celestial Host, and, by inclusion, all the spirits of
just men.

But the Gods are not limited in number. For human convenience they are
called seven, or twelve, or twenty-four, or seventy; but these are names
of orders only. Beyond number are the orbs in infinite space, and each
of these is a God. Phoibos is legion, so also is Hermes, so also
Aphrodite, so also Dionysos, so also Ares, Zeus, Hera, Kronos, and the
rest. Phoibos is the

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

spirit of all the suns; Poseidon, of all the seas; and each divinity has
his *quality*, corresponding to the conditions of the elements which
compose his kingdom.

To every planet belongs a different spectrum, and the physical is the
measure of the spiritual. And every physical world of causes has its
spiritual world of effects.

Now, the world of causes is the material and the astral, and the world
of effects is the psychic. Therefore it may be said that the soul is the
*effect* of the body, for organism is before function, and the mineral
before man. And yet it is true that organism is the effect of idea, and
that mind is the cause of evolution. So that spirit is before matter in
its abstract, but not in its concrete conception. All things are
begotten by fission or section in a universal blastoderm or protoplast,
and the power which causes this generation is centrifugal.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[99:1](cws45.htm#fr_163.md) Paris, December 6,
1882. Having previously studied materialistic science in Paris, Mrs
Kingsford returned thither to study materialistic philosophy, when this
and the following Illuminations, to No. XLVII inclusive, were received
by her in elucidation of the subjects studied, and in correction of the
doctrine enunciated by her professor. The Illuminations were received
chiefly in sleep.    E. M.
