#### DEDICATION

To the numerous and world-wide circle of genuine students of Divine
things, who recognised in Anna Kingsford a Seer, an Interpreter, and a
Prophet of the rarest lucidity and inspiration, and a foremost herald of
the dawning better age: and especially to the Friend whose instant and
enthusiastic appreciation proved an invaluable support in a position of
peculiar difficulty, and beneath whose roof some of the illuminations
herein contained were received, but who desires to remain unnamed: and
also to the "friend, disciple, and literary heir of the renowned magian,
the late Abbé Constant ("Eliphas Levi")"--namely, to the Baron Giuseppe
Spedalieri, for manifold tokens of high approbation and devoted
friendship-this book is affectionately inscribed.

"And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel
to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation,
and tribe, and tongue, and people; and he saith with a great voice, Fear
God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and
worship him that made the heaven and the earth, and sea and fountains of
waters."

APOC. xiv, 6, 7 (R.V.).
