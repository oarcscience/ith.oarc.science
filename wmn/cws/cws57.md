### No. I

#### THE CREDO <span id="fr_192"></span>[1](cws58.htm#fn_192.md)

being a summary of the spiritual history of the Sons of God, and the
mysteries of the kingdoms of the Seven Spheres

I BELIEVE in one God; the Father and Mother Almighty; of whose substance
are the generations of Heaven and of earth: And in Christ Jesus the Son
of God, our Lord; who is conceived of the Holy Ghost; born of the Virgin
Mary; suffereth under the world-rulers; is crucified, dead, and buried;
who descendeth into hell; who riseth again from the dead; who ascendeth
into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God; by whose law the
quick and the dead are judged. I believe in the Seven Spirits of God;
the Kingdom of Heaven; the communion of the elect; the passing-through
of souls; the redemption of the body; the life everlasting; and the
Amen. <span id="fr_193"></span>[2](cws58.htm#fn_193.md) \[A\]

He that believeth and is initiated shall be saved; and he that believeth
not shall consume away.\[B\]
