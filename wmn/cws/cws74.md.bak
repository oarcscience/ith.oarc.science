#### CONCERNING THE DIVINE IMAGE, OR THE VISION OF ADONAI <span id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_226.md)

\[Owing at once to the sanctity and the unpronounceability of the
*Tetragrammaton*, or word of four letters which in the Hebrew
constitutes the name Jehovah, the Hebrews invariably substitute for it
in speaking the name Adonai, which in the A.V. is rendered "the Lord."
These names are, however, substantially identical, in that they alike
imply a duality corresponding to that of the sexes,---a duality which
arises, necessarily, from the nature of the function fulfilled by their
bearer, which is that of the expression, word, or manifestor of Deity in
the dual character of Father-Mother, as expounded in Nos. VII and VIII
of Part II; from which it follows that this Person of the Trinity is,
properly, not "Son" merely, but "Son-Daughter." As thus exhibited, the
Trinity consists of Father, Mother, and Child,--(respectively energy,
substance, and phenomenon),--and represents a mode of the godhead which,
logically (not chronologically, time having no relation to the eternal),
is antecedent to that of the ecclesiastical Trinity, wherein the "Son"
appears as the second person, and the Holy Spirit as the third. For in
this aspect, the "Mother" (substance) is merged in the "Father" (energy
or will), the two together constituting one person,--the first, and the
Son appears as the second, while the third is the Holy Spirit, or
divinity in its dynamic or active mode as distinguished from its static
or passive mode. Proceeding from the Father-Mother through the Soil, and
identical in nature with them, the Holy Spirit is, like them, dual, and
consists of both energy and substance. For which reason the names and
symbols denoting the Holy Spirit are masculine or feminine, according to
the aspect or function concerned. On its procession through the Son the
Holy Spirit differentiates into the seven modes or potencies called the
Seven Spirits of God (as described ill Nos. VI, VIII, and X of Part II)
dividing, like light on its emergence from the prism, into seven rays.
These are the Seven Spirits of God, the creative Elohim, which, with the
three persons of the Trinity, constitute the ten Sephiroth of the
Kabala. Functions of the Supreme and essential principles in the Divine
nature, they are styled, on entering into manifestation, Gods and
Archangels; and inasmuch as they are manifold and various as the spheres
and kingdoms of nature, ill all of which they are operative, and
comprise grades and distinctions innumerable, repeating themselves like
the notes of the musical scale in many keys and tones, their names are
rather titles of orders than designations of individuals. In no case can
they be apprehended of the outer senses, but to souls sufficiently
mature

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

and sensitive they manifest themselves under forms personal and
symbolical of their offices, being both seen and heard of the interior
selfhood. And just as the Rainbow is one, though rainbows are
legion,--inasmuch as all these are manifestations of one and the same
principle inhering in the nature of light,--so is each divinity one,
however multiplied his personality, inasmuch as every appearance is but
a fresh manifestation of one and the same principle subsisting in the
divine nature, and for that reason subsisting also in every soul that is
able to polarise divinity. Thus is the soul "Mother of God" and also of
the Gods, and "Man is a universe in himself, having the thrones of all
the Gods in his temple." And of their co-operation is the edification of
the world into the kingdom of God, and of man in the Divine image, that
of Adonai. Attaining to this image, man has and is Christ, Christ being
the correspondent, equivalent, or counterpart in man, of Adonai in
substance. And, saving Adonai himself, they are the highest objects of
the sensible perception of the soul. That Adonai is the highest of all
such objects is because he is the image beheld in the point of the focus
formed by the convergence of all the consciousnesses of the system and
their polarisation to the highest plane. Beyond him is the "Invisible
Light,"--the "Divine Dark" of the early Christian mystics <span
id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_227.md)--the boundless sea of infinite wisdom,
love, and power, informulate and unmanifest, the universally-diffused
divinity; impersonal in the radical sense of the word, but personal in
the highest degree in its true sense, that of essential consciousness;
and in Adonai taking form and personality in both senses.

The Jehovah or Adonai of the Hebrews is thus no mere "tribal" god, as
supposed by writers more learned and ingenious than experienced or
percipient, on the strength of the defective presentations of Him in the
Hebrew Scriptures; nor is He but a partial aspect only of deity, or a
being unreal and imaginary. He is actually the one and supreme divinity,
the central, radiant, and pivotal point of the universe--its spiritual
sun--the God of Gods, from whom all others proceed, and of whom all
others are modes and aspects. And He is this absolutely and
indefeasibly, how defective and misleading soever the human conceptions
and presentations of Him. And being recognised as such, He is fitly
described as a "jealous" God, in that he reprobates the ascription to
the low or to a part, of the honour due only to the highest and to the
whole; and He is this, not for His own sake-He cannot suffer loss--but
for the sake of those His creatures who, by limiting their ideal of the
Divine perfection, withhold themselves from the realisation of their own
perfection, and thereby from being made in the Divine image. For what
man thinks, that he is.

The vision about to be described of Adonai, was received without any
previous knowledge on the part of its recipient, either of its
possibility, or of its having always been claimed as a recognised fact
of mystical experience, the allusions to it in the Bible, <span
id="fr_228"></span>[2](#fn_228.md) although

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

by no means rare, having altogether escaped her recognition as having
any real basis in the consciousness. <span
id="fr_229"></span>[1](#fn_229.md) On this occasion she had been forewarned
of something of unusual solemnity as about to occur, and prompted to
make certain ceremonial preparations obviously calculated to impress the
imagination. The access came upon her while standing by the open window,
gazing at the moon, then close upon the full. <span
id="fr_230"></span>[2](#fn_230.md) The first effect of the *affiatus* was
to cause her to kneel and pray in a rapt attitude, with her arms
extended towards the sky. It appeared afterwards, that under an access
of spiritual exaltation, she had yielded to a sudden and uncontrollable
impulse to pray that she might be taken to the stars, and shown all the
glory of the universe. Presently she rose, and after gazing upwards in
ecstasy for a few moments, lowered her eyes, and, clasping her arms
around her head as if to shut out the view, uttered in tones of wonder,
mingled with moans and cries of anguish, the following tokens of the
intolerable splendour of the vision she had unwittingly invited\]:--

"Oh, I see masses, masses of stars! It makes me giddy to look at them. O
my God, what masses! Millions and millions! Wheels of planets! <span
id="fr_231"></span>[3](#fn_231.md) O my God, my God, why didst Thou create?
It was by Will, all Will, that Thou didst it. Oh! what might, what might
of Will! Oh, what gulfs! what gulfs! Millions and millions of miles
broad and deep! Hold me--hold me up! I shall sink--I shall sink into the
gulfs. I am sick and giddy, as on a billowy sea. I am on a sea, an
ocean-the ocean of infinite space. Oh, what depths! what depths! I
sink--I fail! I cannot, cannot bear it!

"I shall never come back. I have left my body for ever. I am dying; I
believe I am dead. Impossible to return from such a distance! Oh, what
colossal forms! They are the angels of the planets. Every planet has its
angel standing erect above it. And what beauty--what marvellous beauty!
I see Raphael. <span id="fr_232"></span>[1](#fn_229.md)

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

see the angel of the earth. He has six wings. He is a god--the god of
our planet. I see my genius who called himself A. Z.; but his name is
Salathiel. <span id="fr_233"></span>[1](#fn_232.md) Oh, how surpassingly
beautiful he is! My genius is a male, and his colour is ruby. Yours,
Caro, <span id="fr_234"></span>[2](#fn_233.md) is a female, and sapphire.
They are friends--they are the same--not two, but one; and for that
reason they have associated us together, and speak of themselves
sometimes as I, sometimes as We. It is the angel of the earth himself
that is your genius and mine, Caro. He it was who inspired you, who
spoke to you. <span id="fr_235"></span>[3](#fn_234.md) And they call me
Bitterness. And I see sorrow-oh, what unending sorrow do I behold!
Sorrow, always sorrow, but never without love. I shall always have love.
How dim is this sphere! Oh, save me--save me! It is my demon that I am
approaching. It is Paris--Paris himself, once of Troy, now of the city
that bears his name. He is floating recumbent. He turns his face towards
me. How beautiful and dark he is! Oh, he has goat's horns--he has goat's
horns! Save me, save me from him! Ah, he sees me not. I forgot I am
invisible. Now I have passed him. <span id="fr_236"></span>[4](#fn_235.md)

"I am entering a brighter region now. What glorious form of womanhood is
that, so queenly, so serene, and endowed with all wisdom? It is Pallas
Athena,--a real personage in the spiritual world! And yonder is one of
whom I have no need to ask. I am passing through the circle of the
Olympians. It is Aphrodite, mother of love and beauty. O Aphrodite,
spirit of the waters, firstborn of God, how could I adore thee! And men
on earth now deem the gods and goddesses of Greece mere fables! And I
behold them living and moving in strength and beauty before me! I see
also the genii of all the nations dwelling serenely in heavenly circles.
What crowds and crowds of gods from India and Egypt!

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

Who are those with the giant muscles? They are Odin and Thor, and their
fellow-gods of Scandinavia. Not dead and lost; only withdrawn from the
world whereon they sought in vain to stamp their images for ever.

"Oh, the dazzling, dazzling brightness! Hide me, hide me from it! I
cannot, cannot bear it! It is agony supreme to look upon. O God! O God!
Thou art slaying me with Thy light. It is the throne itself, the great
white throne of God that I behold! Oh, what light! what light! It is
like an emerald? a sapphire? No; a diamond. In its midst stands Deity
erect, His right hand raised aloft, and from Him pours the light of
light. Forth from His right hand streams the universe, projected by the
omnipotent repulsion of His will. Back to His left, which is depressed
and set backwards, returns the universe, drawn by the attraction of His
love. Repulsion and attraction, will and love, right and left, these are
the forces, centrifugal and centripetal, male and female whereby God
creates and redeems. Adonai! O Adonai! Lord God of life, made of the
substance of light, how beautiful art Thou in Thine everlasting youth!
with Thy glowing golden locks, how adorable! And I had thought of God as
elderly and venerable! As if the Eternal could grow old! And now not as
Man only do I behold Thee! For now Thou art to me as Woman. Lo, Thou art
both. One, and Two also. And thereby dost Thou produce creation. O God,
O God! why didst Thou create this stupendous existence? Surely, surely,
it had been better in love to have restrained Thy will. It was by will
that Thou createdst, by will alone, not by love, was it not?--was it
not? I cannot see clearly. A cloud has come between.

"I see Thee now as Woman. Maria is next beside Thee. Thou art Maria.
Maria is God. O Maria! God as Woman! Thee, Thee I adore!
Maria-Aphrodite! Mother! Mother-God!

"They are returning with me now, I think. But I shall never get back.
What strange forms! how huge they are! All angels and archangels. Human
in form, yet some with eagles' heads. All the planets are inhabited! how
innumerable is the variety of forms! O universe of existence, how
stupendous is existence! Oh I take me not near the sun; I cannot bear
its heat. Already do I feel myself burning. Here is Jupiter! It has nine
moons! Yes, nine. Some are exceedingly small. And, oh, how red it is! It
has so much iron. And what enormous men and women! There is evil there
too. For evil is wherever are matter and limitation. But the people of
Jupiter are far better than we on

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

earth. They know much more; they are much wiser. There is less of evil
in their planet. Ah! and they have another sense. What is it? No, I
cannot describe it. I cannot tell what it is. It differs from any of the
others. We have nothing like it. I cannot get back yet. I believe I
shall never get back. I believe I am dead. It is only my body you are
holding. It has grown cold for want of me. Yet I must be approaching. It
is growing shallower. We are passing out of the depths. But I can never
wholly return--never--never."

\[Her apprehension was not without justification; for her body was
completely torpid, and several hours passed before consciousness was
fully restored to it.

It is impossible for anyone who did not witness the intensely dramatic
action and emphasis with which these ejaculations were uttered, to form
anything like an adequate conception of the sense of reality they
conveyed. Able as I was from my own experience, above referred to, to
follow her in her journey from sphere to sphere to the very highest and
inmost, I found it impossible to doubt that the seeress was in the
right, when, recalling her recollections, she declared her conviction
that what she had beheld was no illusion, but the reality itself of the
universe. There was for both of us the same sense of journeying through
vast abysses of space and traversing various spheres of being; and the
same conviction that the journey was at once to the centre of one's own
and to that of all consciousness.

She described the attitude and expression of Adonai as those of the
absolute calmness and repose of the power without effort which is
predicable only of the Infinite. Though bearing the aspect of humanity,
it was impossible, she felt, to represent the form in fixed outline, and
declared that it seemed like a sacrilege to attempt thus to portray it.
She nevertheless made the attempt, with the result reproduced opposite.
It represents, however, only the masculine aspect, the impression of the
feminine having entirely failed to reach her outer consciousness; and
this had been the case also on the only other occasion on which she had
beheld it. (See p. 54.) In this respect our experiences differed. She
was most strongly impressed by the masculine, or will, element in Deity;
and I by the feminine, or love, element. In another respect, too, there
was a difference. For her the form was that of one standing erect and,
though calm, energetic: for me it was that of the "Sitter on the Throne"
and wholly reposeful, though similarly engaged in the act of projection
and recall. These differences were doubtless due to difference of
temperament in the beholders. The soul is a living lens which invests
with its own "tincture" the objects beheld by it.\]

by myself a few months previously had been similarly independent of
knowledge or anticipation, and I had been constrained to maintain an
absolute reserve in regard to it. The account in *The Perfect Way* (IX.
v.) was written from our joint experiences. Many of our experiences were
thus duplicated, hers, however, far exceeding mine both in number and in
fulness of detail. The latter, probably, because I always make a point
of retaining possession of the external comciousness, in order to
observe and record at the same time, and not knowing the result of
letting myself go altogether.    E. M. See *Life of Anna Kingsford*,

had been suddenly opened to her view a universe of inter-planetary
systems, invisible to the bodily sight; and while dazzlingly bright to
the spiritual eyes, of a consistency too tenuous to intercept or refract
the solar rays. A like effect would also be produced by entering the
fourth dimension of space, where all things would be beheld unmodified
by distance or any intervening medium. E. M.

divinity has a separate name for each office fulfilled by him. Salathiel
thus denotes the angel of the earth in his capacity as head of the order
of Genii, in the sense of being the supreme spirit (of the planet) of
whom each genius is a manifestation, and into whom they return on the
accomplishment of their mission. As the first and last letters of the
alphabet, A and Z, correspond to the "Alpha and Omega," in the sense of
implying comprehension of the genii of all orders or grades, and
consequently all the rays of the spiritual prism.    E. M.
