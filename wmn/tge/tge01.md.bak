# INTRODUCTION.

MOST of the ideas which permeate our social, religious, and political
institutions of to-day arise from misconceptions of the human body.
These institutions which are the outcome of civilization define laws to
regulate and control the actions of *human beings*; and yet, the proper
understanding of the growth and development of man individually was, and
is, considered of secondary importance in adjusting these laws. My
philosophy has been on the lines of Aristotle, "The *nature* of
everything is best seen in its smallest portions." My efforts were for
the individual or ontogenic development of humanity as the only basis
upon which to frame any laws--that by understanding and giving the
proper attention to this the *quality* of the whole must of necessity
ultimately reach a higher standard. And as the influence of woman is
vital, no advance could be made until the co-operation of woman was
properly understood and insisted upon as essential to any ideal society,
to any true realization of religion, to any perfect government. Active
not passive aid is what I demanded from woman. She must be appreciated
as the architect of the human race. Men are what their mothers make
them. Their intelligence or ignorance has the power to teach them to
revere or desecrate

womanhood. Night after night throughout the United States I pleaded for
the intellectual emancipation and the redemption of womanhood from
sexual slavery--insisting that social evils could only be eliminated by
making your daughters the peers of your sons--that the greatness of a
nation depends upon its mothers. I denounced as criminal the ignorant
marriages which were filling the world with their hereditary
consequences of woe, shame, and every manner of crime. The theme of my
public work was that I would make it a criminal offence to allow persons
to marry in ignorance of parental responsibility. I realized that the
Bible was little understood, but had in it the germ of a great and
divine truth--that is the redemption of the body. A part of this truth
regarding the "Garden of Eden," &c., I gave in my extemporaneous
lectures. It was afterwards put into consecutive biblical articles and
pamphlets. I did not then give the whole truth with which my soul had
become illuminated; for I knew the fulness of time was not yet. I
considered the work I was then doing as a necessary part of the
evolution of thought--as initiatory to my reformatory work. In a book
that I am at present writing, it is my intention to give the entire
truth of all Bibles, which was only partially understood by primeval
religious sects through their ignorance of the phenomena of life.
