# WOMAN, CHURCH AND STATE

## CHAPTER I.

### THE MATRIARCHATE.

    Woman is told that her present position in society is entirely due
to Christianity; that it is superior to that of her sex at any prior age
of the world, Church and State both maintaining that she has ever been
inferior and dependent, man superior and ruler. These assertions are
made the basis of opposition to her demands for exact equality with man
in all the relations of life, although they are not true either of the
family, the church, or the state. Such assertions are due to
non-acquaintance with the existing phase of historical knowledge, whose
records the majority of mankind have neither time nor opportunity of
investigating.

    Christianity tended somewhat from its foundation to restrict the
liberty woman enjoyed under the old civilizations. Knowing that the
position of every human being keeps pace with the religion and
civilization of his country, and that in many ancient nations woman
possessed a much greater degree of respect and power than she has at the
present age, this subject will be presented from a historical
standpoint. If in so doing it helps to show man's unwarranted usurpation
over woman's religious and civil rights, and the very great difference
between true religion and theology, this

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

book will not have been written in vain, as it will prove that the most
grievous wrong ever inflicted upon woman has been in the Christian
teaching that she was not created equal with man, and the consequent
denial of her rightful place in Church and State.

    The last half century has shown great advance in historical
knowledge; libraries and manuscripts long inaccessible have been opened
to scholars, and the spirit of investigation has made known many secrets
of the past, brought many hidden things to light. Buried cities have
been explored and forced to reveal their secrets; lost modes of writing
have been deciphered, and olden myths placed upon historic foundations.
India is opening her stores of ancient literature; Egypt, so wise and so
famous, of which it was anciently said: "If it does not find a man mad
it leaves him mad," has revealed her secrets; hieroglyph. inscribed
temples, obelisks and tombs have been interpreted; papyri buried 4,000
and more years in the folds of bandage-enveloped mummies have given
their secrets to the world. The brick libraries of Assyria have been
unearthed, and the lost civilization of Babylonia and Chaldea imparted
to mankind. The strange Zunis have found an interpreter; the ancient
Astec language its Champollion, and the mysteries of even our western
continent are becoming unveiled. Darkest Africa has opened to the light;
the colossal images of Easter Island hint at their origin; while the new
science of philology unfolds to us the history of peoples so completely
lost that no other monument of their past remains. We are now informed
as to the condition of early peoples, their laws, customs, habits,
religion, comprising order and rank in the state, the rules of descent,
name, property, the circumstances of

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

family life, the position of mother, father, children, their temples and
priestly orders; all these have been investigated and a new historic
basis has been discovered. Never has research been so thorough or
long-lost knowledge so fully given to the world.

    These records prove that woman had acquired great liberty under the
old civilizations. A form of society existed at an early age known as
the Matriarchate or Mother-rule. Under the Matriarchate, except as son
and inferior, man was not recognized in either of these great
institutions, family, state or church. A father and husband as such, had
no place either in the social, political or religious scheme; woman was
ruler in each. The primal priest on earth, she was also supreme as
goddess in heaven. The earliest semblance of the family is traceable to
the relationship of mother and child alone. Here the primal idea of the
family had birth.<span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) The child bore its
mother's name, tracing its descent from her; her authority over it was
regarded as in accord with nature; the father having no part in the
family remained a wanderer. Long years elapsed before man, as husband
and father, was held in esteem. The son, as child of his mother, ranked
the father, the mother taking precedence over both the father and the
son.<span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md) Blood relationship through a
common mother preceded that of descent through the father in the
development of society.<span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md)

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

    This, priority of the mother touched not alone the family, but
controlled the state and indicated the form of religion. Thus we see
that during the Matriarchate, woman ruled; she was first in the family,
the state, religion, the most ancient records showing that man's
subjection to woman preceded by long ages that of woman to man. The
tribe was united through the mother; social, political and religious
life: were all in harmony with the idea of woman as the first and
highest power. The earliest phase of life being dependent upon her, she
was recognized as the primal factor in every relation,<span
id="fr_4"></span>[4](#fn_4.md) man holding no place but that of dependant.

    Every part of the world to-day gives evidence of the system;
reminiscences Of the Matriarchate everywhere abound. Livingstone found
African tribes swearing by the mother and tracing descent through her.
Marco Polo discovered similar customs in his Asiatic voyages, and the
same customs are extant among the Indians of our own continent.
Bachofen<span id="fr_5"></span>[5](#fn_5.md) and numerous
investigators<span id="fr_6"></span>[6](#fn_6.md) agree in the statement
that in the earliest forms of society, the family, government, and
religion, were all under woman's control; that in fact society started
under woman's absolute authority and power.

    The second step in family life took place when the father, dropping
his own name, took that of his child. This old and wide-spread custom is
still extant in many portions of the globe; the primitive peoples of
Java, Australia and Madagascar are among those still

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

continuing its practice.<span id="fr_7"></span>[7](#fn_7.md) By this step
the father allied himself to both mother and child, although still
holding an inferior position to both. The Matriarchal family was now
fully established, descent still running in the female line. Thus, as
has been expressed, we find that woman's liberty did not begin to-day
nor under modern religions or forms or government, but that she was in
reality the founder of civilization, and that in the most remote times
woman enjoyed superiority of rights in all the institutions of
life.<span id="fr_8"></span>[8](#fn_8.md) And yet so difficult is it to
break away from educated thought, so slight a hold have historical facts
upon the mind when contrary to pre-conceived ideas, that we find people
still expressing the opinion that man's place has always been first in
government. Even under those forms of society where woman was undisputed
head of the family, its very existence due to her, descent entirely in
the female line, we still hear assertion that his must have been the
controlling political power. But at that early period to which we trace
the formation of the family, it was also the political unit. And when
peoples became aggregated into communities, when tribal relations were
ultimately recognized, woman still held superior position, and was the
controlling power in government, and never was justice more perfect,
never civilization higher than under the Matriarchate. Historians agree
as to the high civilization even to-day of those nations

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

or tribes still preserving traces of Matriarchal customs. Even under its
most degenerate form, the family, governmental and religious rights of
women are more fully recognized than under any phase of Christian
civilization. In all the oldest religions, equally with the Semitic
cults, the feminine was recognized as a component and superior part of
divinity, goddesses holding the supreme place. Even at much later
periods woman shared equally with man in the highest priestly offices,
and was deified after death. In Egypt, Neith the Victorious, was
worshiped as mother of the gods, and in the yearly festival held in her,
honor, every family took part for the time holding a priestly office. To
neglect this duty was deemed an omission of great irreverence.<span
id="fr_9"></span>[9](#fn_9.md) The most ancient occultism recognized the
creative power as feminine and preceding both gods and men.

    Under the Matriarchate, monogamy was the rule; neither polyandry or
promiscuity existed.<span id="fr_10"></span>[10](#fn_10.md)

    For long years after the decline of the Matriarchate we still
discover that among many of the most refined nations, woman still
possessed much of the power that belonged exclusively to her during that
early period. Ancient Egypt, recognized as the wisest nation since the
direct historic period, traced descent even to the throne in the female
line. To this reminiscence of the Matriarchate are we indebted for the
story of Moses and his preservation by an Egyptian princess in direct
contravention of the Pharaoh's orders, as told by the Bible and
Josephus. She not alone preserved the child's life but carried him to
the

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

king as her son given to her by the bounty of the river and heir to his
throne, As showing woman's power in that kingdom, the story is worthy of
being farther traced. Josephus says that to please his daughter, the
king took the child in his arms, placing his crown on the baby head, but
the chief priest at that moment entering the room, in a spirit of
prophecy cried aloud, "Oh King; this is the child of whom I foretold
danger; kill him and save the nation, "at the same time striving to take
the babe from the king. But the princess caught him away, thus setting
both kingly and priestly power at defiance, taking this step by virtue
of her greater authority, protecting him until he reached manhood and
causing him to be educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, in a
college under her own control. Nor in the supreme hour of the nation's
peril, when the king, too old to lead his armies to battle, demanded
Moses as heir to the throne in his place, would she give him up until
she had exacted an oath from her father, the potent Pharaoh, that he
meant the youth no harm.

    The famous Iroquois Indians, or Six Nations, which at the discovery
of America held sway from the great lakes to the Tombigbee river, from
the Hudson to the Ohio, and of whom it has been said that 'another
century would have found them master of all tribes to the Gulf of Mexico
on the south, and the Mississippi on the west, showed alike in form of
government, and in social life, reminiscences of the Matriarchate. The
line of descent, feminine, was especially notable in all tribal
relations such as the election of Chiefs, and the Council of Matrons, to
which all disputed questions were referred for final adjudication. No
sale of lands was valid without consent of the squaws and among

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

the State Archives at Albany, New York, treaties are preserved signed by
the "Sachems and Principal Women of the Six Nations."<span
id="fr_11"></span>[11](#fn_11.md) The women also possessed the veto power
on questions of war. Sir William Johnston mentions an instance of Mohawk
squaws forbidding the war-path to young braves. The family relation
among the Iroquois demonstrated woman's superiority in power. When an
Indian husband brought the products of the chase to the wigwam, his
control over it ceased. In the home, the wife was absolute; the sale of
the skins was regulated by her, the price was paid to her. If for any
cause the Iroquois husband and wife separated, the wife took with her
all the property she had brought into the wigwam; the children also
accompanied the mother, whose right to them was recognized as supreme.
So fully to this day is descent reckoned through the mother, that
blue-eyed, fair-haired children of white fathers are numbered in the
tribe and receive both from state and nation their portion of the yearly
dole paid to Indian tribes. The veriest pagan among the Iroquois, the
renowned and important Keeper of the Wampum, and present sole
interpreter of the Belts which give the most ancient and secret history
of this confederation, is Ephraim Webster, descended from a white man,
who, a hundred or more years since, became affiliated through marriage
with an Indian woman, as a member of the principal nation of the
Iroquois, the Onondagas. As of yore, so now, the greater and lesser
Council Houses of the Iroquois are upon the "mountain" of the Onondaga
reservation a few miles from the city of Syracuse, New York. Not alone
the Iroquois but most Indians of North America trace descent in the

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

female line; among some tribes woman enjoys almost the whole legislative
authority and in others a prominent share.<span
id="fr_12"></span>[12](#fn_12.md) Lafitte and other Jesuit missionary
writers are corroborated in this statement by Schoolcraft, Catlin,
Clark, Hubert Bancroft of the Pacific coast, and many students of Indian
life and customs. But the most notable fact connected with woman's
participation in governmental affairs among the Iroquois is the
statement of Hon. George Bancroft that the form of government of the
United States, was borrowed from that of the Six Nations.<span
id="fr_13"></span>[13](#fn_13.md) Thus to the Matriarchate or Mother-rule
is the modern world indebted for its first conception of inherent
rights, natural equality of condition, and the establishment of a
civilized government upon this basis. Although the reputation of the
Iroquois as warriors appears most prominent in history, we nevertheless
find their real principles to have been the true Matriarchal one of
peace and industry. Driven from the northern portion of America by
vindictive foes, compelled to take up arms in self-protection, yet the
more peaceful occupations of hunting and agriculture were continually
followed. Their history was preserved by means of wampum, while under
their women the science of government reached the highest form known to
the world. Among the Zunis of New Mexico, woman still preserves supreme
religious and political authority; the Paramount Council consisting of
six priests under control of a supreme priestess who is the most
important functionary of the tribe.<span id="fr_14"></span>[14](#fn_14.md)
This form of government is traceable to their earliest civilization at
which period their cities were grouped in sevens, six of

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

them constructed upon a uniform plan; the supreme seventh containing six
temples clustered about a supreme central seventh temple. While male
priests ruled over the six primal cities the central and superior
seventh was presided over by a priestess who not alone officiated at the
central temple, but to whom the male priests of the six cities and six
inferior temples were subservient. The ancient Lycians, the Sclavs, the
Basques of Spain,<span id="fr_15"></span>[15](#fn_15.md) the Veddas of
Ceylon,<span id="fr_16"></span>[16](#fn_16.md) the inhabitants of Malabar,
the aborigines of widely separated lands, all show convincing proof of
woman's early superiority in religion, in the state, and in the family.
Monogamy was a marked feature of the Matriarchate; Backofen, who has
written voluminously upon the Matriarchate, recognizes it as peculiarly
characteristic of woman's government. He also says the people who
possessed the Mother-rule together with Gynaikokraty (girls' rule,)
excelled in their love of peace and justice. Under the Matriarchal
family and tribal system even long after its partial supersedence by the
incoming Patriarachate, the marriage relation was less oppressive to
woman than it has been under most centuries of christian civilization.
Daughters were free in their choice of husbands, no form of a force or
sale existing.<span id="fr_17"></span>[17](#fn_17.md)

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

    One of the most brilliant modern examples of the Matriarchate was
found in Malabar at the time of its discovery by the Portuguese in the
XV century. The Nairs were found to possess a fine civilization,
entirely under the control of women, at a period when woman's position
in England and on the Continent of Europe, was that of a household and
political slave. Of Malabar it has been said, that when the Portuguese
became acquainted with the country and the people, they were not so much
surprised by the opulence of their cities, the splendor of all their
habits of living, the great perfection of their navy, the high state of
the arts, as they were to find all this under the entire control and
government of women. The difference in civilization between christian
Europe and pagan Malabar at the time of its discovery was indeed great.
While Europe with its new art of printing, was struggling against the
church for permission to use type, its institutions of learning few, its
opportunities for education meagre; its terrible inquisition crushing
free thought and sending thousands each year to a most painful death,
the uncleanliness of its cities and the country such as to bring
frequent visits of the plague; its armies and its navies with but one
exception, imperfect; its women forbidden the right of inheritance,
religious, political, or household authority;--the feminine principle
entirely eliminated from the divinity--a purely masculine God the
universal object of worship, all was directly the opposite in Malabar.
Cleanliness, peace, the arts, a just form of government, the recognition
of the feminine both in humanity and in the divinity were found in
Malabar. To the question of a Danish missionary concerning their opinion
of a Supreme Being, this beautiful answer was given.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

    The Supreme Being was a Form and yet has no Form; he can be likened
to nothing; we cannot define him and say that he is this or that; he is
neither Man or Woman; neither Heaven or Earth, and yet he is all;
subject to no corruption, no mortality and with neither sleep nor rest,
he is Almighty and Omnipotent without Beginning and without End.<span
id="fr_18"></span>[18](#fn_18.md)

    Under the Missionaries sent by England to introduce her own barbaric
ideas of God and man, this beautiful Matriarchal civilization of Malabar
soon retrograded and was lost.

    The ancient Mound Builders of America, of whom history is silent and
science profoundly ignorant, are proven by means of symbolism to have
been under Matriarchal rule, and Motherhood religion. Anciently
motherhood was represented by a sphere or circle. The circle, like the
mundane egg, which is but an elongated circle, contains everything in
itself and is the true microcosm. It is eternity, it is feminine, the
creative force, representing spirit. Through its union with matter in
the form of the nine digits it is likewise capable of representing all
natural things.<span id="fr_19"></span>[19](#fn_19.md) The perfect circle
of Giotto was an emblem of divine motherhood in its completeness. It is
a remarkable fact--its significance not recognized,--that the roughly
sketched diameter within the circle, found wherever boys congregate, is
an ancient mystic sign<span id="fr_20"></span>[20](#fn_20.md) signifying
the male and female, or the double-sexed deity. It is the union of all
numbers, the one within the

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

zero mark comprising ten, and as part of the ancient mysteries
signifying God, the creative power, and eternal life; it was an emblem
of The All.

    In many old religions, the generative principle was regarded as the
mother of both gods and men. In the Christian religion we find tendency
to a similar recognition in Catholic worship of the Virgin Mary. The
most ancient Aryans were under the Matriarchate, the feminine recognized
as the creative power. The word "ma" from which all descendants of those
peoples derive their names for mother, was synonymous with 'Creator.'
Renouf, the great antiquarian authority upon the Aryan's,<span
id="fr_21"></span>[21](#fn_21.md) gives the songs and ceremonies of the
wedding. In these, the woman is represented as having descended to man
from association with divine beings in whose custody and care she has
been, and who give her up with reluctance. In Sanscrit mythology,<span
id="fr_22"></span>[22](#fn_22.md) the feminine is represented by Swrya, the
Sun, the source of life, while the masculine is described as Soma, a
body. Soma, a beverage of the gods especially sacred to Indra, was the
price paid by him for the assistance of Vâyu, the swiftest of the gods,
in his battle against the demon Vritra. A curious line of thought is
suggested. The marriage of the man to the woman was symbolized as his
union with the gods. Soma, a drink devoted to Indra, the highest god,
signified his use of a body, or the union of spirit and body. In the
same manner, woman representing spirit, by her marriage to man became
united with a body. As during the present dark age, the body has been
regarded more highly than the spirit, we find a non-recognition of the
woman, although the union of spirit

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

and body is symbolized in the Christian church by the sacrament of bread
and wine. During the purest period of Aryan history marriage was
entirely optional with woman and when entered into, frequently meant no
more than spiritual companionship. Woman equally with man was entitled
to the Brahminical thread; she also possessed the right to study and
preach the Vedas, which was in itself a proof of her high position in
this race. The Vedas, believed to be the oldest literature extant, were
for many ages taught orally requiring years of close application upon
part of both teacher and student.

    The word "Veda" signifies *to-know*; the latter from "Vidya" meaning
*wise*. The English term widow is tracable to both forms of the word,
meaning a wise woman-one who knows man. Many ages passed before the
Vedas were committed to writing.<span id="fr_23"></span>[23](#fn_23.md) At
that early day the ancestral worship of women--departed mothers-was as
frequent as that of departed fathers, women conducting such services
which took place three times a day. In the old Aryan Scriptures the
right of woman to hold property, and to her children, was much more
fully recognized than under the Christian codes of to-day. Many of the
olden rights of women are still extant in India. The learned Keshub
Chunder Sen vigorously protested against the introduction of English law
into India, upon the ground that it would destroy the ancient rights of
the

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

women of that country. It was primal Indian law that upon the death of
the husband the wife should heir all his property. Marriage was regarded
as an eternal union, the two, by this act, having so fully become one,
that upon the husband's death, one half of his body was still living.
The property and the children were held as equally belonging to the
husband or the wife.

    Colebrook's Digest of Hindoo Law, compiled from the writings of the
Bengal Pundit Jergunnat, \`Na Tercapancháma, from those of Vasist ha,
Cátayana, and other Indian authorities says:

    In the Veda, in Codes of Law, in sacred ordinances, the wife is held
as one person with the husband; both are considered one. When the wife
is not dead, half the body remains; how shall another take the property
when half the body of the owner lives? After the death of the husband
the widow shall take his wealth; this is primeval law.

    Though a woman be dependent, the alienation of female property, or
of the mother's right over her son by the gift of a husband alone<span
id="fr_24"></span>[24](#fn_24.md) is not valid in law or reason;

    The female property of wives like the property of a stranger, may
not be given, for there is want of ownership.

    Neither the husband, nor the son, nor the father, nor the brother,
have power to use or alien the legal property of a woman.

    We hold it proper that the wife's co-operation shall be required in
civil contracts and in religious acts under the text.

    A gift to a wife is irrevocable.

    The collection of East Indian laws made under authority of the
celebrated Warren Hastings, 1776,

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

is of similar character. The kinds of property a wife can hold separate
from her husband at her own disposal by will, are specified.

    During long centuries while under Christian law the Christian wife
was not allowed even the control of property her own at the time of
marriage, or of that which might afterwards be given her, and her right
of the disposition of property at the time of her death was not
recognized in Christian lands, the Hindoo wife under immemorial custom
could receive property by gift alike from her parents, or from
strangers, or acquire it by her own industry, and property thus gained
was at her own disposal in case of her death. Another remarkable feature
of Indian law contrasting with that of Christian lands was preference of
woman over man in heirship. In case of a daughter's death, the mother
heired in preference to father, son, or even husband.

    That is called a woman's property; First. Whatever she owns during
the Agàmini Shàdee, i. e. Days of Marriage;
\*        \*        \*        \*

    Whatever she may receive from any person as she is going to her
husband's home or coming from thence.

    Whatever her husband may at any time have given her; whatever she
has received at any time from a brother; and whatever her father and
mother may have given her.

    Whatever her husband on contracting a second marriage may give her
to pacify her.

    Whatever a person may have given a woman for food or clothing.

    Whatever jewelry or wearing apparel she may have received from any
person; also whatever a woman may receive from any person as an
acknowledgment or payment for any work performed by her. Whatever she
may by accident have found anywhere.

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

    Whatever she may gain by painting, spinning, needle-work or any
employment of this kind.

    Except from one of the family of her father, one of the family of
her mother, or one of the family of her husband, whatever she may
receive from any other person. Also if the father or mother of a girl
give anything to their son-in-law, saying at the same time: "This shall
go to our daughter," and even without any words to this purpose at the
time of making the gift, if they merely have it in their intention that
the thing thus given should revert to their daughter, all and every one
of these articles are called a woman's property.

    Her right of final disposal by will is also specified. Her effects
acquired during marriage go to her daughters in preference to her sons,
and possessing no daughters, to her mother.

    When a woman dies, then whatever effects she acquired during the
Agàmini Shàdee, even though she hath a son living, shall go first to her
unmarried daughter; if there is but one unmarried daughter she shall
obtain the whole; if there are several unmarried daughters, they all
shall have equal share.

    Property under the three forms of marriage, if no unmarried
daughters and others mentioned here, goes to her mother before to her
father; and if neither, to her husband, and if no husband to husband's
younger brother, or several younger brothers, (if several).

    The specification of gifts of intention is remarkable in securing
property to the wife that was seemingly given by the parents to the
husband alone. An equally remarkable fact is the father's heirship in
preference to the husband's, and the heirship of the daughters and
mother in preference to any male relative however near, and is in
striking contrast to Christian law in reference to woman's property. If
a husband neglect to provide his wife necessary food and clothing, the
East Indian wife is allowed to procure

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

them by any means in her power. Maine has not failed to recognize the
superior authority of the eastern wife in relation to property over that
of the Christian wife. He says:

    "The settled property of a married woman incapable of alienation by
her husband, is well known to the Hindoos under the name of Stridham."

    It is certainly a remarkable fact that the institution seems to have
developed among the Hindoos at a period relatively much earlier than
among the Romans. The *Mitakshara*, one of the oldest and most revered
authorities of the Hindoo judicial treatises, defines Stridham, or
woman's property, as that which is given to the wife by the father, the
mother, or a brother at the time of the wedding, before the nuptial
fire.

    But adds Maine:

    "The compiler of Mitakshara adds a proportion not found elsewhere;
also property which she may have acquired by inheritance, purchase,
partition, seizure or finding, is denominated woman's property. \* \* If
all this be Stridham, it follows that the ancient Hindoo law secured to
married women an even greater degree of proprietary independence than
that given to them by the modern English Married Woman's Property Act.

    Property is common to the husband and the wife. The ample support of
those who are entitled to maintenance is rewarded with bliss in heaven;
but hell is the portion of that man whose family is afflicted with pain
by his neglect. Therefore the Hindoo husband is taught to maintain his
family with the utmost care. Maxims from the sacred books show the
regard in which the Hindoo woman is held:

    "He who despises woman despises his mother."

    "Who is cursed by woman is cursed by God."

    "The tears of a woman call down the fire of heaven on those who make
them flow."

    "Evil to him who laughs at woman's sufferings; God shall laugh at
his prayers."

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

    "It was at the prayer of a woman that the Creator pardoned man;
cursed be he who forgets it."

    "Who shall forget the sufferings of his mother at his birth shall be
reborn in the body of an owl during three successive transmigrations."

    "There is no crime more odious than to persecute woman."

    "When women are honored the divinities are content; but when they
are not honored all undertakings fail."

    "The households cursed by women to whom they have not rendered the
homage due them, find themselves weighed down with ruin and destroyed as
if they had been struck by some secret power."

    "We will not admit the people of to-day are incapable of
comprehending woman, who alone can regenerate them."

    The marriage ceremony is of the slightest kind and under three
forms:

1\. Of mutual consent by the interchange of necklaces or strings of
flowers in some secret place.

2\. A woman says, "I am become your wife," and the man says, "I
acknowledge it."

3\. When the parents of a girl on her marriage day say to the
bridegroom: "Whatever act of religion you perform, perform it with our
daughter," and the bridegroom assents to this speech.

    The comparatively modern custom of suttee originated with the
priests, whose avaricious desires created this system in order thereby
to secure the property of the widow. The Vedas do not countenance either
suttee or the widow's relinquishment of her property, the law
specifically declaring "If a widow should give all her property and
estate to the Brahmins for religious purposes, the gift indeed is valid,
but the act is improper and the woman blamable." An ancient scripture
declares that "All the wisdom of the Vedas, and all that has been
written in

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

books, is to be found concealed in the heart of a woman." It is a Hindoo
maxim that one mother is worth a thousand fathers, because the mother
carries and nourishes the infant from her own body, therefore the mother
is most reverenced. A Hindoo proverb declares that "Who leaves his
family naked and unfed may taste honey at first, but shall afterwards
find it poison." Another says, "A wife is a friend in the house of the
good."

    Ancient Egypt worshiped two classes of gods; one purely spiritual
and eternal, the other secondary but best beloved, were believed to have
been human beings who from the services they had rendered to humanity
were upon death admitted to the assembly of the gods. Such deification
common in ancient times, is still customary in some parts of the earth.
Within the past few years a countryman of our own was thus apotheosized
by the Chinese to whom he had rendered valuable service at the time of
the Tae-ping rebellion.<span id="fr_25"></span>[25](#fn_25.md) Ancient
Egyptians recognized a masculine and feminine principle entering in all
things both material and spiritual. Isis, the best beloved and most
worshiped of the secondary gods, was believed by them to have been a
woman who at an early period of Egyptian history had rendered that
people invaluable service. She was acknowledged as their earliest
law-maker, through whose teaching the people had risen from barbarism to
civilization. She taught

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

them the art of making bread<span id="fr_26"></span>[26](#fn_26.md) from
the cereals theretofore growing wild and unused, the inhabitants at an
early day living upon roots and herbs. Egypt soon became the grain
growing portion of the globe, her enormous crops of wheat not alone
aiding herself, but rendering the long stability of the Roman Empire
possible. The science of medicine was believed to have originated with
Isis; she was also said to have invented the art of embalming,
established their literature, founded their religion. The whole Egyptian
civilization was ascribed to the woman-goddess, Isis, whose name
primarily Ish-Ish, signified Light, Life.<span
id="fr_27"></span>[27](#fn_27.md) Isis, and Nepthys--the Lady of the
House--were worshiped as the Beginning and the End. They were the Alpha
and Omega of the most ancient Egyptian religion. The statues of Isis
bore this inscription:

    "I am all that has been, all that shall be, and none among mortals
has hitherto taken off my veil."

    Isis was believed to contain germs within herself for the
reproduction of all living things. The most universal of her 10,000
names was, "Potent Mother Goddess."<span id="fr_28"></span>[28](#fn_28.md)
This Egyptian regard for Isis is an extremely curious and interesting
reminiscence of the Matriarchal period. Her worship was universal
throughout Egypt. Her temples were magnificent. Her priests, consecrated
to purity, were required to bathe daily, to wear linen garments unmixed
with animal fibre, to abstain from animal food, and also

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

from those vegetables regarded as impure.<span
id="fr_29"></span>[29](#fn_29.md) Two magnificent festivals were yearly
celebrated in her honor, the whole people taking part. During one of
these festivals her priests bore a golden ship in the procession. The
ship, or ark,<span id="fr_30"></span>[30](#fn_30.md) is peculiarly
significative of the feminine principle, and wherever found is a
reminiscence of the Matriarchate. The most sacred mysteries of the
Egyptian religion, whose secrets even Pythagorus could not penetrate, to
which Herodotus alluded with awe, and that were unknown to any person
except the highest order of priests, owed their institution to Isis, and
were based upon moral responsibility and a belief in a future life. The
immortality of the soul was the underlying principle of the Egyptian
religion.

    Isis seems to have been one of those extraordinary individuals, such
as occasionally in the history of the world have created a literature,
founded a religion, established a nationality. She was a person of
superior mentality, with power to diffuse intelligence.

    Moses, "learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians," borrowed much
from Isis. The forms and ceremonies used in her worship were largely
copied by him, yet lacked the great moral element-immortal life-so
conspicuously taught as a part of Egyptian religion. The Sacred Songs of
Isis were an important part of the literature of Egypt. Plato, who
burned his own poems after reading Homer, declared them worthy of the
divinity, believing them to be literally 10,000 years old.<span
id="fr_31"></span>[31](#fn_31.md) All orders of the priesthood were open to
women in Egypt; sacred colleges existed for

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

them, within whose walls dwelt an order of priestesses known as "God's
Hand," "God's Star." Its ranks were recruited from women of the
principal families, whose only employment was the service of the gods.
"Daughter of the Deity," signified a priestess.

    Women performed the most holy offices of religion, carrying the
Sacred Sistrum and offering sacrifices of milk, both ceremonies of great
dignity and importance, being regarded as the most sacred service of the
divinity. Such sacrificial rites were confined to queens and princesses
of the royal household. Amés-Nofri-Ari, a queen who received great honor
from Egyptians, spoken of as the "goddess-wife of Amun," the supreme god
of Thebes, for whose worship the wonderful temple of Karnak was founded
by a Pharaoh of the XII. dynasty, is depicted on the monuments as the
Chief High Priest--the Sem, whose specific duty was offering sacrifices
and pouring out libations in that temple. By virtue of her high office
she preceded her husband, the powerful and renowned Rameses II. The high
offices of the church were as habitually held by women as by men;
Princess Neferhotep, of the fifth dynasty, was both a priestess and a
prophetess of the goddesses Hathor and Neith, the representatives of
celestial space, in which things were both created and preserved.

    A priestess and priest in time of the XIII. Pharaoh represented on a
slab of limestone, n possession of the Ashmolean Library of Oxford,
England, is believed to be the oldest monument of its kind in the world,
dating to 3,500, B. C.

    Queen Hatasu, the light of the brilliant XVIII. dynasty, is depicted
upon the monuments as preceding

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

in acts of worship the great Thotmes III, her brother, whom she had
associated with herself upon the throne, but who did not acquire supreme
power until after her death.<span id="fr_32"></span>[32](#fn_32.md) The
reign of Hatasu was pre-eminent as the great architectural period of
Egypt, the engraving upon monuments during her reign closely resembling
the finest Greek intaglio. Egypt, so famous for her gardens and her art
of forcing blossoms out of season, was indebted to this great queen for
the first acclimatizing of plants. Upon one of her voyages she brought
with her in baskets filled with earth several of those Balsam trees from
Arabia, which were numbered among the precious gifts of the Queen of
Sheba to King Solomon. The red granite obelisks erected by Hatasu before
the gates of Karnak, the most magnificent and loftiest ever erected in
Egypt, were ninety-seven feet in height and surmounted by a pyramid of
gold.

    As early as the XI. Pharaoh, II. dynasty, the royal succession
became fixed in the female line. A princess was endowed with privileges
superior to a prince, her brother, her children reigning by royal
prerogative even when her husband was a commoner; the children of a
prince of the Pharaonic house making such marriage were declared
illegitimate.

    From the highest to the most humble priestly office, women
officiated in Egypt. A class of sacred women W ere doorkeepers of
temples, another order known as "Sacred Scribes" were paid great
deference. The Pellices or Pellucidæ of Amun were a remarkable body of
priestesses whose burial place has but recently been discovered. They
were especially devoted to the service of Amun-Ra, the Theban Jove.
Egypt was indebted

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

to priestesses for some of its most important literature. To Penthelia,
a priestess of Phtha<span id="fr_33"></span>[33](#fn_33.md) the God of
Fire, in Memphis, Bryant ascribes the authorship of the Iliad and the
Odyssey, Homer<span id="fr_34"></span>[34](#fn_34.md) in his travels
through that country, by aid of a suborned priest, having stolen these
poems from the archives of the temples of Phtha where they had been
deposited for safe keeping.

    The priestly class of prophetesses was large in Egypt, their
predictions not infrequently changing the course of that country's
history. To his daughter, the prophet-priestess Athryte, was the great
Rameses II indebted for the prophecy which led him into his conquering
and victorious career. Known as one of the four great conquerors of
antiquity,<span id="fr_35"></span>[35](#fn_35.md) reigning sixty years, he
greatly added to the wealth and renown of Egypt.

    The class of priestesses called Sibyls were early. known in Egypt,
India, and other portions of the ancient world. They were regarded as
the most holy order of the priesthood and held to be in direct communion

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

with the gods, who through them revealed secrets to the lower order of
priests; the word Sibyl originating from Syros, i. e. God. The learned
Beale defines Sibyl as thought, therefore a woman in possession of God's
thought. The names of ten renowned Sibyls have come down to our day. The
Sibyline Books for many years governed the destinies of Rome. Oracles
were rendered from the lips of a priestess known as the Pythia; the
famous Delphian Shrine for ages ruling the course of kings and nations.

    Upon the monuments of Egypt, those indisputable historic records,
queens alone are found wearing the triple crown, significant of
ecclesiastical, judicial and civil power, thus confirming the statement
of Diodorus that queens were shown greater respect and possessed more
power than kings: the pope alone in modern times claiming the emblematic
triple crown. A comparison between the men and women of the common
people of this country, shows no less favorably for the latter. Women
were traders, buying and selling in the markets while the men engaged in
the more laborious work of weaving at home. Woman's medical and hygienic
knowledge is proven by the small number of infantile deaths.<span
id="fr_36"></span>[36](#fn_36.md) At the marriage ceremony the husband
promised obedience to the wife in all things, took her name, and his
property passed into her control; according to Wilkinson great harmony
existed in the marriage relation, the husband and wife sitting upon the
same double chair in life and resting at death in the same tomb.

    Montesquieu says:

    It must be admitted although it shocks our present customs, that
among the most polished peoples, wives

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

have always had authority over their husbands. The Egyptians established
it by law in honor of Isis, and the Babylonians did the same in time of
Semiramis. It has been said of the Romans that they ruled all nations
but obeyed their wives.

    Crimes against women were rare in Egypt and when occurring were most
severely punished.<span id="fr_37"></span>[37](#fn_37.md) "Rameses III.
caused this inscription to be engraved upon his monuments:

    To unprotected woman there is freedom to wander through the whole
country wheresoever she list without apprehending danger.

    A woman was one of the founders of the ancient Parsee religion,
which taught the existence of but a single god, thus introducing
monotheism into that rare old kingdom. Until the introduction of
Christianity woman largely preserved the liberty belonging to her in the
old civilizations. Of her position under Roman law before this period
Maine (Gaius) says;

    The jurisconsults had evidently at this time assumed the equality of
the sexes as a principle of the law of equity. The situation of the
Roman woman whether married or single became one of great personal and
proprietary independence; but Christianity tended somewhat from the
commencement to narrow this remarkable liberty. The prevailing state of
religious sentiment may explain why modern jurisprudence has adopted
these rules concerning the position of women which belong to an
imperfect civilization. No society which preserves any tincture of
Christian institutions is likely to restore to married women the
personal liberty conferred on them by middle Roman law. Canon law has
deeply injured civilization.

    Rome not only secured remarkable personal and

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

proprietary rights to woman, but as Vestal Virgin, she held the highest
priestly office. No shrine equalled that of the Vestals in sanctity;
none was so honored by the state. To their care the sacred fire was
entrusted, and also the Palladium; those unknown articles upon whose
preservation not alone the welfare but the very existence of Rome was
held to depend. The most important secrets of state were entrusted to
them and their influence in civil affairs was scarcely secondary to
their religious authority. In troubled times, in civil wars, in extreme
emergencies of the commonwealth they acted as ambassadors, or were
chosen umpires to restore peace between the parties. In state
ceremonies, in the most solemn, civil or religious meetings they
performed important duties. They were superior to the common law or the
authority of the consul. The most important secrets were entrusted to
them, wills of the emperors and documents of state confided to their
care; offenses against them were punished with death. If meeting a
criminal on his way to execution, he was pardoned as a direct
intervention of heaven in his behalf. Among their important privileges
was exemption from public taxes, the right to make a will, interment
within the city walls, the right to drive in the city where no other
carriage was allowed; even the consuls were obliged to make room for
them to pass. Chosen from noble families when between the ages of six
and ten, their terms of service was thirty years.

    The order of Vestal Virgins flourished eleven hundred years, having
been founded seven hundred years before the Christian era and continuing
four hundred years afterwards. But those women all young, all between
the ages of six years and forty, so closely

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

guarded the secrets of the Penetralia that to this day they still remain
as unknown as when in their charge. The order was destroyed in the
fourth century, but the ruins of their temple recently discovered prove
that when obliged to flee from the sacred enclosure they first
demolished the most holy portion where the secrets of Rome were
hidden.<span id="fr_36"></span>[36](#fn_36.md) Recent important
archæological discoveries at the Atrium Vertæ in the Forum, corroborate
history in regard to the high position and extraordinary privileges of
the Vestals. Several statues have been found representing the sacred
maiden with the historic fillet about her head and the cord beneath her
breast. Medallions worn upon the breast of their horses have also been
unearthed. The wealth of the order was extremely great, both its public
and private property being exempt from that conscription which in times
of war reached all but a few favored individuals.

    The names by which Imperial Rome was known were all feminine; Roma,
Flora, Valentia; nearly its first and greatest goddess was Vesta.<span
id="fr_39"></span>[39](#fn_39.md)

    Sacred and secret were originally synonymous terms. All learning was
sacred, consequently secret, and as only those possessed of learning
were eligible to the priestly office it is readily seen that knowledge
was a common heritage of primitive women. Letters, numbers, astrology,
geography and all branches of science were secrets known only to
initiates. The origin of the most celebrated mysteries, the Eleusinian,
and those of Isis, were attributed to woman, the most perfect temple of
ancient or modern times, the

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

Parthenon, or Temple of the Virgins, was dedicated to the goddess
Minerva.

Chryseis was priestess of Juno in Argo. This office was of great civil
as well as religious importance regulating their dates and chronology.
To the present day in China woman assists at the altar in ancestral
worship, the prevailing form of religious adoration. The mother of a
family is treated with the greatest respect<span
id="fr_40"></span>[40](#fn_40.md) and the combined male and female
principle is represented in god under the name Fou-Fou, that is,
Father-Mother.<span id="fr_41"></span>[41](#fn_41.md) When the Emperor

husband at family councils, trials, etc. As Regent, she governs the
Empire with wisdom, dignity, power, as was shown during the co-regency
of the Empresses of the East and of the West, their power continuing
even after the promotion of a boy-heir to the throne.

    A Thibetan woman empire extant between the VI and VII centuries A.

    Under the law of the Twelve Tables, founded A. U. C. 300, woman
possessed the right of repudiation in marriage. The code itself was
ascribed to a woman of that primitive Athens founded and governed by
women long years previous to the date of modern Athens. The change in
woman's condition for the worse under Christianity is very remarkable
and everywhere it is noticed. Among the Finns, before their conversion,
the mother of a family took precedence of the father in the rites of
domestic worship. Under the Angles, a wound inflicted upon a virgin was
punished with double the penalty of the same injury inflicted upon a
man, remarkable as showing the high esteem and reverence in which women
were held. Before the introduction of Christianity, the Germans bound
themselves to chastity in the marriage relation; under Catholicism the
wife is required to promise the devotion of her body to the marital
rite. German women served as priestesses of Hertha, and during the time
of Rome's greatest power, Wala or Valleda,--this title being
significative of a supremely wise woman, a prophetess,--was virtual
ruler of the Germanic forces; Druses when about invading Germany was
repelled by her simple command to "Go Back." But under Christianity the
German woman no longer takes part in public affairs, education is
denied, the most severe and degrading labor of field, streets and mine
falls upon her, while in the family she is serf to father, brother,
husband.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

    The women of ancient Scandinavia were treated with infinite respect;
breach of marriage promise was classed with perjury; its penalty was
outlawry. Marriage was regarded as sacred and in many instances the
husband was obliged to submit to the wife.<span
id="fr_44"></span>[44](#fn_44.md) Those old Berserkers reverenced their
Alruna, or Holy Women, on earth and worshiped goddesses in heaven,
where, according to Scandinavian belief, gods and goddesses sat together
in a hall without distinction of sex.

    The whole ancient world recognized a female priesthood, some
peoples, like the Roman, making national safety dependent upon their
ministration; others as in Egypt, according them pre-eminence in the
priestly office, reverencing goddesses as superior to gods; still other
as the Scandinavians, making no distinction in equality between gods and
goddesses; others governing the nation's course through oracles which
fell from feminine lips; still others looking to the Sibylline Books for
like decision.<span id="fr_45"></span>[45](#fn_45.md) Those historians
anxious to give most credit to the humanizing effect of Christianity
upon woman are compelled to admit her superiority among pagan nations
before the advent of this religion.<span id="fr_46"></span>[46](#fn_46.md)

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

    The Patriarchate under which Biblical history and Judaism commenced,
was a rule of men whose lives and religion were based upon passions of
the grossest kind, showing but few indications of softness or
refinement. Monogamous family life, did not exist, but a polygamy whose
primal object was the formation of a clan possessing hereditary chiefs
ruling aristocratically. To this end the dominion of man over woman and
the birth of many children was requisite. To this end polygamy was
instituted, becoming as marked a feature of the Patriarchate as monogamy
was of the Matriarchate. Not until the Patriarchate were wives regarded
as property, the sale of daughters as a legitimate means of family
income, or their destruction at birth looked upon as a justifiable act.
Under the Patriarchate, society became morally revolutionized, the
family, the state, the form of religion entirely changed. The theory of
a male supreme God in the interests of force and authority, wars, family
discord, the sacrifice of children to appease the wrath of an offended
(male) deity are all due to the Patriarchate. These were practices
entirely out of consonance with woman's thought and life. Biblical
Abraham binding Isaac for sacrifice to Jehovah, carefully kept his
intentions from the mother Sarah. Jephtha offering up his daughter in
accordance with his vow, allowing her a month's life for the bewailment
of her virginity, are but typical of the low regard of woman under the
Patriarchate. During this period the destruction of girl children became
a widely extended practice, and infantile girl murder the custom of many
nations. During the Matriarchate all life was regarded as holy; even the
sacrifice of animals was unknown.<span id="fr_47"></span>[47](#fn_47.md)
The most ancient and

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

purest religions taught sacrifice of the animal passions as the great
necessity in self-purification. But the Patriarchate subverted this
sublime teaching, materializing spiritual truths, and substituting the
sacrifice of animals, whose blood was declared a sweet smelling savor to
the Lord of Hosts.

    Both infanticide and prostitution with all their attendant horrors
are traceable with polygamy,--their origin--to the Patriarchate or
Father-rule, under which Judaism and Christianity rose as forms of
religious belief. Under the Patriarchate woman has ever been regarded as
a slave to be disposed of as father, husband or brother chose. Even in
the most Christian lands, daughters have been esteemed valuable only in
proportion to the political or pecuniary advantage they brought to the
father, in the legal prostitution of an enforced marriage. The sacrifice
of woman to man's baser passions has ever been the distinguishing
characteristic of the Patriarchate. But woman's degradation is not the
normal condition of humanity, neither did it arise from a settled
principle of evolution, but is a retrogression, due to the grossly
material state of the world for centuries past, in which it has lost the
interior meaning or spiritual significance of its own most holy words.

    Jehovah signifies not alone the masculine and the feminine
principles but also the spirit or vivifying intelligence. It is a
compound word indicative of the three divine principles.<span
id="fr_48"></span>[48](#fn_48.md) Holy Ghost, although in Hebrew a noun of
either gender, masculine, feminine, neuter, is invariably rendered
masculine by Christian translators of the Bible.<span
id="fr_49"></span>[49](#fn_49.md) In the Greek, from whence we obtain

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

the New Testament, spirit is of the feminine gender, although invariably
translated masculine. The double-sexed word, Jehovah, too sacred to be
spoken by the Jews, signified the masculine-feminine God.<span
id="fr_50"></span>[50](#fn_50.md) The proof of the double meaning of
Jehovah, the masculine and feminine signification, Father-Mother, is
undeniable. Lanci, one of the great orientalists, says:

    Jehovah should be read from left to right, and pronounced Ho-Hi;
that is to say He-She (Hi pronounced He,) Ho in Hebrew being the
masculine pronoun and Hi the feminine. Ho-Hi therefore denotes the male
and female principles, the *vis genatrix*.<span
id="fr_51"></span>[51](#fn_51.md)

    Kingsford says:

    The arbitrary and harsh aspect under which Jehovah is chiefly
presented in the Hebrew Scriptures is due not to any lack of the
feminine element either in His name or in His nature, or to any failure
on the part of the inspired leaders of Israel to recognize their
equality, but to the rudimentary condition of the people at large, and
their consequent amenability to the delineation of the stern side only
of the Divine Character.<span id="fr_52"></span>[52](#fn_52.md)

    The Hebrew word 'El Shaddai,' translated, 'The Almighty' is still
more distinctively feminine than Iah, as it means 'The Breasted God,'
and is made use of in the Old Testament whenever the especially feminine
characteristics of God are meant to be indicated.<span
id="fr_53"></span>[53](#fn_53.md)

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

    The story of the building of the tower of Babel and the subsequent
confusion of language possesses deep interior significance; the word
(Babel) meaning 'God the Father' as distinct and separate from the
feminine principle. The confusion which has come upon humanity because
of this separation has been far more lamentable in its results than a
mere confounding of tongues.<span id="fr_54"></span>[54](#fn_54.md) In the
earliest religions the recognition of the feminine principle in the
divinity is everywhere found. "I am the Father and Mother of the
Universe" said Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita.

    An Orphic hymn says: "Zeus is the first and the last, the head and
the extremities; from him have proceeded all things. He is a man and an
immortal nymph i. e. the male and female element. The Sohar declares
"the ancient of the ancient has a form and has no form."

    The Holy Spirit, symbolized by a dove, is a distinctively feminine
principle--the Comforter--and yet has ever been treated by the Christian
Church as masculine, alike in dogmas propounded from the pulpit, and in
translations of the Scriptures. A few notable exceptions however appear
at an early date. Origen expressly referred to the Holy Ghost as
feminine, saying: "The soul is maiden to her mistress the Holy Ghost".
An article upon the "Esoteric character of the Gospels" in Madam
Blavatsky's "Lucifer" (November 1887) says:

    Spirit or the Holy Ghost was feminine with the

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

Jews as most ancient peoples and it was so with the early Christians;
Sophia of the Gnostics and the third Sephiroth, Binah (the female
Jehovah of the Cabalists,) are feminine principles "Divine Spirit" or
*Ruach*, "One is She the spirit of the Elohim of Life," is said in
Sepher Yetzirah.<span id="fr_55"></span>[55](#fn_55.md)

An early canonical book of the New Testament known as "The Everlasting
Gospel" also as "The Gospel of the Holy Ghost" represents Jesus as
saying. "My mother the Holy Ghost, took me by the hair of my head up
into a mountain."

    The word sacred simply meaning secret, having its origin as shown at
the time when knowledge was kept hidden from the bulk of mankind, only
to be acquired by initiation in the mysteries, so also the word 'holy'
simply means whole, that is, undivided. In its ignorance, unwisdom, and
fear of investigation, mankind has allowed a

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

division of the two divine principles, male and female, to obtain firm
hold in their minds. Prejudice, which simply means prejudgment, a
judgment without proof, has long ruled mankind, owing chiefly to that
bondage of the will inflicted by a tyrannous self seeking priesthood.
But we have now reached a period in history when investigation is again
taking the place of blind belief and the truth, capable of making man
free, is once more offered, It is through a recognition of the divine
element of motherhood as not alone inhering in the great primal source
of life but as extending throughout all creation, that it will become
possible for the world, so buried in darkness, folly and superstition,
to practice justice toward woman. Not legislation but education will
bring about the change; not external acts but internal thought. It is
but a few years since the acknowledgment of a feminine element even in
plants was regarded by the church as heretical. Yet though still
perceiving but partial truth, science now declares the feminine
principle to inhere in plants, rocks, gems, and even in the minutest
atoms; thus in some degree recognizing the occult axiom "As it is above,
so it is below."

resulted in the establishment of Persia and India. \* \* there is
nothing more striking than the status of woman at that early age. Then
the departed mothers were served as faithfully by the younger members of
the family as departed fathers. The mother quite as often, if not more
frequently than the father, conducted the services of the dead ancestry,
which took place three times a day, often consisting of improvised
poetry.--*Elizabeth Peabody on the Aryans*.

amongst other arguments they endeavor to prove it especially by the

forget all his sorrows past, for the poet seems to have made an exact
experiment of the potion Nepenthes, which he says Helen received from
Polymnestes, the wife of Thonus, and brought it from Thebes in Egypt;
and indeed in that city, even at this day, the women use this medicine
with good success, and they say that in ancient times the medicine for
the cure of anger and sorrow was only to be found among the
Diospolitans, Thebes and Diospolis being affirmed by them to be one and
the same city.--*Diodorus Siculus*, Vol. I, Chap. VII.

Tomyris caused the head of Cyrus to be plunged into a sack of blood

<span id="fn_40"></span>[40.](#fr_40.md)  According to Commissioner of
Education, Chang Lai Sin, Chinese women can read and write, and when a
husband wishes to do anything he consults with his wife, and when the
son comes home, although he may be prime minister, he shows his respect
to his mother by bending his knee. "I claim that the Chinese
institutions and system of education, both with regard to men and women,
are far superior to those of any of the neighboring nations for a great
many centuries, and that it is only within this century that China,
after having been defeated by so many reverses in her arms, has turned
to a foreign country--to the United States--for example and
instruction."

revelation of God is progressive. That in the first or antediluvian
period of human nature God was known only as a Great Spirit; that in the
second or Jewish period he was revealed as the Jehovah. He, she or a
dual being, male or female, the "I am that I am;" that Jesus in the
third cycle made God known as a father; and that in the last cycle
commencing with 1770, A. D., "God is revealed in the character of
Mother, an eternal Mother, the bearing spirit of all the creation of
God."--*W. A. Parcelle*.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[45.](#fr_45.md)  The divine element, according to
the idea of the ancient world, was composed of two sexes. There were
*dei femma*, and hence temples sacred to goddesses; holy sanctuaries
where were celebrated mysteries in which men could not be permitted to
participate. The worship of goddesses necessitated priestesses, so that
women exercised the sacerdotal office in the ancient world. The wives of
the Roman Consuls even offered public sacrifices at certain festivals.
The more property the wife had, the more rights she had.--*M.
Derraimes*.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[46.](#fr_46.md)  The superiority of woman's
condition in Europe and America is generally attributed to Christianity.
We are anxious to give some credit to that influence, but it must not be
forgotten that the nations of Northern Europe treated women with
delicacy and devotion long before they were converted to the Christian
faith. Long before the Christian era women were held in high estimation,
and enjoyed as many privileges as they generally have since the spread
of Christianity. Nichols.--*Women of all Nations*.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[54.](#fr_54.md)  A chief signification of the word
Babel among Orientals was "God the Father." The Tower of Babel therefore
signifies the Tower of God the Father--a remarkable indication of the
confusion, not alone of tongues, but of religious ideas arising from
man's attempt to worship the father alone.--*E. L. Mason*.

Injustice to the sex reached its culmination in the enthronement of a
personal God with a Son to share his glory, but wifeless, motherless,
daughterless.--Dr. *William Henry Channing*.

<span id="fn_page_47">p. 47</span>  

<span id="fn_55"></span>[55.](#fr_55.md)  Those who have studied the
ancient lore of Cabalistic books, know that in the ineffable name
Yod-he-vau (or Jehovah), the first letter *yod* signifies the masculine,
the second letter *hu* or *ha* the feminine, while the last letter *vau*
or *vaud* is said by Cabalists to indicate the vital life which fills
all the throbbing universe from the union of eternal love with eternal
wisdom. It is this ineffable holy (or whole) Mother and Father, which
must be exalted and imaged forth in family and government with the
woman-force more strongly emphasized, before even human society can be
filled with that new creation with which the iridescent subtle
mother-essence infuses and enwreathes all other realms of the pulsing
universe.

No man seems shaken at hearing of the fatherhood of Jehovah. Is
motherhood less divine? Nothing but a male-born theology evolved from
the overheated fires of feeling would have burned away all recognition
of the fact that the presence of the "Eternal Womanly" in Yod-he-vau's
being is necessary to full-sphered perfection; none but those whose
degraded estimate of woman has caused them to desecrate her holy office
of high priestess of life, will see anything more sacrilegious in a
recognition of "Our Mother in Heaven," and in offering her the prayer
"hallowed be thy name, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven,"
than in saying the same things to the Father there.

Those who chose to search will discover that the "Eternal Fatherhood of
God, in regard to which Protestant theologians talk so much, has been
balanced in all ancient religions as well as in the nature of things by
the eternal Motherhood in Jehovah's being, without which Fatherhood
would be impossible. This Motherhood has always and everywhere been the
preserver and creator of the omnipresent life of all kinds which fills
the throbbing universe. Yod-he-vau's *Lost Name* can never be hallowed
(made whole) without the Mother is there. E. I. Mason.--*The Lost Name*.
