    This Book is **Inscribed** to the Memory of my Mother, who was at
once mother, sister, friend:

    Dedicated to all Christian women and men, of whatever creed or name
who, bound by Church or State, have not dared to Think for Themselves:

    Addressed to all Persons, who, breaking away from custom and the
usage of ages, dare seek Truth for the sake of Truth. To all such it
will be welcome; to all others, aggressive and educational.
