# CHAPTER X.

*Genesis xxix, xxxi.*

18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said I will serve thee seven years for
Rachel thy younger daughter.

19 And Laban said, *It is* better that I give her to thee, than that I
should give her to another man; abide with me.

20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him
*but* a few days, for the love he had to her.

21 ¶ And Jacob said unto Laban, Give *me* my wife, for my days are
fulfilled.

22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a
feast.

23 And it came to pass in the evening that be took Leah his daughter,
and brought her to him.

26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the
younger before the firstborn.

27 We will give thee Rachel also thou shalt serve with me yet seven
other years.

28 And Jacob did so, and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.

29 ¶ And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said
unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto my mine own place, and to
my country.

26 Give *me* my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and
let me go; for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.

17 ¶ Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels;

18 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had
gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram,
for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.

19 And Laban went to shear his sheep; and Rachel had stolen the images
that *were* her father's

20 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told
him not that he fled;

22 And it was told Laban on the third day, that Jacob was fled.

23 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days'
journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

WHILE Laban played his petty deceptions on Jacob, the latter proved
himself in fraud and overreaching fully his match. In being compelled to
labor fourteen years for Rachel instead of seven, as agreed upon, he
amply revenged himself in getting possession of all Laban's best cattle,
availing himself of a physiological law in breeding of which Laban was
profoundly ignorant.

The parting of Jacob and Laban was not amicable, although they did not
come to an open rupture. Rachel's character for theft and deception is
still further illustrated. Having stolen her father's images and hidden
them under the camel's saddles and furniture, and sat thereon, when her
father came to search for the images, which he valued highly, she said
she was too ill to rise, so she calmly kept her seat, while the tent was
searched and nothing found, thus by act as well as word, deceiving her
father.

{p. 60}

Jacob and his wives alike seemed to think Laban fair game for fraud and
deception. As Laban knew his images were gone, he was left to suspect
that Jacob knew where they were, so little regard had Rachel for the
reputation of her husband. In making a God after their own image, who
approved of whatever they did, the Jews did not differ much from
ourselves; the men of our day talk too as if they reflected the opinions
of Jehovah on the vital questions of the hour. In our late civil war
both armies carried the Bible in their knapsacks, and both alike prayed
to the same God for victory, as if he could be in favor of slavery and
against it at the same time.

Like the women, too, who are working and praying for woman suffrage,
both in the state legislature and in their closets, and others against
it, to the same God and legislative assembly. One must accept the
conclusion that their acquaintance with the Lord was quite as limited as
our own in this century, and that they were governed by their own
desires and judgment, whether for good or evil, just as we are; their
plans by day and their dreams by night having no deeper significance
than our own. Some writers say that the constant interposition of God in
their behalf was because they needed his special care and attention. But
the irregularity and ignorance of their lives show clearly that their
guiding hand was of human origin. If the Jewish account is true, then
the God of the Hebrews falls far short of the Christian ideal of a good,
true manhood, and the Christian ideal as set forth in the New Testament
falls short of our ideal of the Heavenly Father to-day. We have no fault
to find with the Bible as a mere history of an ignorant, undeveloped
people, but when special inspiration is claimed for the historian, we
must judge of its merits by the moral standard of to-day, and the
refinement of the writer by the questionable language in which he
clothes his descriptions.

We have often wondered that the revising committees that have gone over
these documents so often, should have adhered so closely to such gross
translations. Surely a fact related to us in coarse language, is not
less a fact when repeated in choice,

{p. 61}

words. We need an expurgated edition of most of the books called holy
before they are fit to place in the hands of the rising generation.

Some members of the Revising Committee write me that the tone of some of
my comments should be more reverent in criticising the "Word of God."
Does any one at this stage of civilization think the Bible was written
by the finger of God, that the Old and New Testaments emanated from the
highest divine thought in the universe? Do they think that all the men
who wrote the different books were specially inspired, and that all the
various revising committees that have translated, interpolated, rejected
some books and accepted others, who have dug round the roots of the
Greek and Hebrew to find out the true meaning, have one and all been
watched and guided in their literary labors by the great spirit of the
universe, who by immutable law holds the solar system in place, every
planet steadily moving in its own elliptic, worlds upon worlds revolving
in order and harmony?

These great object-lessons in nature and the efforts of the soul to
fathom the incomprehensible, are more inspiring than any written page.
To this "Word of God" I bow with reverence, and I can find no language
too exalted to express my love, my faith, my admiration.

To criticise the peccadilloes of Sarah, Rebekah and Rachel does not
shadow the virtues of Deborah, Huldah and Vashti; to condemn the laws
and customs of the Jews as recorded in the book of Genesis, does not
destroy the force of the golden rule and the ten commandments. Parts of
the Bible are so true, so grand, so beautiful, that it is a pity it
should have been bound in the same volume with sentiments and
descriptions so gross and immoral.
