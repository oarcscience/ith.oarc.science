## PREFACE

The interest my family and friends have always manifested in the
narration of my early and varied experiences, and their earnest desire
to have them in permanent form for the

{p. 154}

amusement of another generation, moved me to publish this volume. I am
fully aware that its contents have no especial artistic merit, being
composed partly of extracts from my diary, a few hasty sketches of my
travels and people I have met, and of my opinions on many social
questions.

The story of my private life as the wife of an earnest reformer, as an
enthusiastic housekeeper, proud of my skill in every department of
domestic economy, and as the mother of seven children., may amuse and
benefit the reader.

The incidents of my public career as a leader in the most momentous
reform yet launched upon the world-the emancipation of woman-will be
found in "The History of Woman Suffrage."

New York City, September, 1897        ELIZABETH CADY STANTON.

Mrs. Stanton in this book, in her inimitable way, relates anecdotes of,
and experiences with, a number of the leading women, statesmen, authors,
and reformers of the last sixty years. The following are a few names
selected at random from the

Elizabeth Cady Stanton's recollections, covering eighty years, easily
come first in the array of new noteworthy books, because of the surprise
they will afford the public, having been almost unheralded; because of
the impressive and protracted public career of the author; because of
her inflexible devotion to and sincerity in a cause long unpopular, and
because, moreover, Mrs. Stanton is an American. This is a most
interesting volume.--N. Y. *Times*.

PRESS COMMENTS--(Continued).

The story of Mrs. Stanton's life is one which interests many thousands
in this country, and which will also be read with interest in other
lands, for her reputation as a reformer and writer is international; her
strong personal characteristics give to this autobiographical work a
charm of its own. It contains some of the most entertaining
reminiscences that have been given to the public. It is a book which is
sure to be widely read.--Worcester *Spy*.

The personal element is the fascinating part of the book which holds
one's attention and keeps him reading to the end. It is a bright,
breezy, and radical turn-the-world-upside-down book. We do not like its
religious tone. We do not like the author's occult theosophy. We do not
like her sociology, with its good word for the windmill logic of the
speculative Bellamy. We do not like her views of marriage and divorce.
But when all is said, and with all these wide differences lying between
us to qualify our enjoyment of this book, we have enjoyed it much. Mrs.
Stanton is a first-rate raconteuse and fills her pages with amusing
recitals and brilliant encounters--N. Y. *Independent*.

book at $2 per copy, postage prepaid. We will forward five (5) copies of

### PRESS COMMENTS

##### ON THE

## WOMAN'S BIBLE

The comments are right up to date.--Cincinnati *Tribune*.

The most humorous book of the year.--The Hartford *Seminary Record*.

Of all possible books this is perhaps the most extraordinary
possible.--*The Week*, Toronto, Canada.

A very clever analysis of passages relating to the sex.--*Public
Opinion*, N. Y. City.

The new Woman s Bible is one of the remarkable productions of the
century.--Denver *News*.

A unique edition of the Scripture. An extraordinary presentment of Holy
Writ!--Denver *Times*.

The work is unique. Its aim is to help the cause of woman in her battle
for equality.--*Beacon*, Akron, Ohio.

Robert G. Ingersoll is the only person on earth capable of a work equal
to Mrs. Stanton's sensation, "The Woman's Bible."--Chicago
*Times-Herald*.

The attack of the new woman on the King James Bible will be observed
with interest where it does not alarm. But let "The Woman's Bible" and
the truth prevail. It may be that Lot himself was turned into a pillar
of salt.--Chicago *Post*.

It has come at last, as it was bound to come--the emancipated woman's
Bible. The wonder is it has been delayed so long. This is not a
blasphemous book.--The *Egyptian Gazette*, Alexandria, Egypt.

The "new woman" has broken out in a fresh direction and published "The
Woman's Bible." In it the conduct of Adam, the father of the race, is
described as "to the last degree dastardly."--Westminster *Budget*,
London, Eng.

One of the most striking protests devised by woman for the purpose of
showing her rejection of the conditions under which our mothers lived.
It is evidently the mission of "The Woman's Bible" to exalt and dignify
woman.--*The Morning*, London, Eng.

We have read some of the passages of

the commentary prepared for "the Woman's Bible" by that very
accomplished American woman and Biblical student, Mrs. Elizabeth Cady
Stanton. They are a great deal more satisfactory than many of the
comments upon the same texts that we have read in other and more
pretentious Commentaries. Mrs. Stanton's interpretative remarks are
shrewd and sensible--Editorial N. Y. *Sun*.

Of man-made commentaries on the Bible we have had sufficient to stock a
library and yet they have left room for this commentary by women. These
revisers have proved the need of an intelligent examination of the
Scriptures from the woman's point of view. The lady commentators are not
wanting in a sense of humor--the quality in which biblical critics of
the male sex are usually unhappily deficient. There is much that is very
funny and very interesting in this new commentary upon the Bible.--*The
Daily Chronicle*, London, Eng.

The *Standard* says, "The Sisterhood of Advanced Women has taken a bold
step towards emancipation. It has long groaned under certain
implications of servitude contained in a few passages of Scripture, and
has, therefore, determined to abolish these disabilities by publishing
'The Woman's Bible.'" It is not only the type that is new. New readings
of old passages are given, and the volume contains suggestions to show
that the verses about women's inferiority really mean the opposite of
the ordinary acceptation. In it Eve is rather praised than otherwise for
having eaten the apple. It is pointed out that Satan did not tempt her
with an array of silks and satins, and gold watches, or even a cycling
costume--the things which some people think most seductive to her
descendants--but with the offer of knowledge; a man being of such a
lethargic and groveling nature that a similar lofty ambition never
entered his mind. Besides, if the fruit was not to be eaten, Eve should
have been informed of the fact at first hand, and not through an
agent.--*Pall Mall Gazette*, London, Eng.
