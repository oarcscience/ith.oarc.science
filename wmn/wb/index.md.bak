# THE WOMAN'S BIBLE.

### By Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the Revising Committee

##### \[1898\]

The Woman's Bible, written by famous 19th Century feminist Elizabeth
Cady Stanton and a "Revising Committee", is one of the first attempts by
women to evaluate the Judeo-Christian legacy and its impact on women
through history. Stanton concluded that 'the Bible in its teachings
degrades Women from Genesis to Revelation'. However she and the other
contributors found much to admire in the Bible, particularly some of the
Old Testament women. While many of her views are still controversial,
time and advances in womens' rights have lessened some of the shock
value of this book. Stanton doesn't go as far as some modern feminist
theologians and proclaim 'God is a woman', but there are several
contributions which discuss the gender of the 'Elohim' and the female
aspects of the Kabbalah.

The book is very readable and entertaining, despite occasional
references to now-moot 19th Century political issues (such as temperance
and bimetallism).
