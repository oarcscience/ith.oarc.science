# THE BOOK OF NUMBERS

## CHAPTER I.

*Numbers i*.

And the Lord spake unto Moses in tire wilderness of Sinai, saying,

2 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel,
after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of
*their* names, every male by their polls:

3 ¶ These *are* those which were numbered of the children of Israel by
the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of the camps
throughout their hosts *were* six hundred thousand and three thousand
and five hundred and fifty.

In this chapter Moses is commanded to number the people and the princes
of the tribe, males only, and by the houses of their fathers. As the
object was to see how many effective men there were able to go to war,
the priests, the women, the feeble old men and children were not
counted. Women have frequently been classified with priests in some
privileges and disabilities. At one time in the United States the clergy
were not allowed to vote nor hold office. Like women, they were
considered too good to mingle in political circles. For them to have
individual opinions on the vital questions of the hour might introduce
dissensions alike into the church and the home.

This census of able bodied men still runs on through chapter ii, and all
these potential soldiers are called children of their fathers. Although
at this period woman's chief duty and happiness was bearing children, no
mention is made of the mothers of this mighty host, though some woman
had gone to the gates of death to give each soldier life; provided him
with rations long before he could forage for himself, and first taught
his little feet to march to tune and time. But, perhaps, if we could
refer to the old Jewish census tables we might

{p. 98}

find that the able bodied males of these tribes, favorites of Heaven,
had all sprung, Minerva-like, from the brains of their fathers, and that
only the priests, the feeble old men and the children had mothers to
care for them, in the absence of the princes and soldiers.

However, in some valuable calculations of Schencher we learn that there
was some thought of the mothers of the tribes by German commentators. We
find in his census such references as the following: The children of
Jacob by Leah. The children of Jacob by Zilpah. The children of Jacob by
Rachel. The children of Jacob by Bilhah. But even this generous mention
of the mothers of the tribe of Jacob does not satisfy the exacting
members of the Revising Committee. We feel that the facts should have
been stated thus: The children of Leah, Zilpah, Rachel and Bilhah by
Jacob, making Jacob the incident instead of the four women. Men may
consider this a small matter on which to make a point, but in restoring
woman's equality everywhere we must insist on her recognition in all
these minor particulars, and especially in the Bible, to which people go
for their authority on the civil and social status of all womankind.
