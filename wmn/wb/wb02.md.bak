# INTRODUCTION.

FROM the inauguration of the movement for woman's emancipation the Bible
has been used to hold her in the "divinely ordained sphere," prescribed
in the Old and New Testaments.

The canon and civil law; church and state; priests and legislators; all
political parties and religious denominations have alike taught that
woman was made after man, of man, and for man, an inferior being,
subject to man. Creeds, codes, Scriptures and statutes, are all based on
this idea. The fashions, forms, ceremonies and customs of society,
church ordinances and discipline all grow out of this idea.

Of the old English common law, responsible for woman's civil and
political status, Lord Brougham said, "it is a disgrace to the
civilization and Christianity of the Nineteenth Century." Of the canon
law, which is responsible for woman's status in the church, Charles
Kingsley said, "this will never be a good world for women until the last
remnant of the canon law is swept from the face of the earth."

The Bible teaches that woman brought sin and death into the world, that
she precipitated the fall of the race, that she was arraigned before the
judgment seat of Heaven, tried, condemned and sentenced. Marriage for
her was to be a condition of bondage, maternity a period of suffering
and anguish, and in silence and subjection, she was to play the role of
a dependent on man's bounty for all her material wants, and for all the
information she might desire on the vital questions of the hour, she was
commanded to ask her husband at home. Here is the Bible position of
woman briefly summed up.

Those who have the divine insight to translate, transpose and
transfigure this mournful object of pity into an exalted, dignified

{p. 8}

personage, worthy our worship as the mother of the race, are to be
congratulated as having a share of the occult mystic power of the
eastern Mahatmas.

The plain English to the ordinary mind admits of no such liberal
interpretation. The unvarnished texts speak for themselves. The canon
law, church ordinances and Scriptures, are homogeneous., and all reflect
the same spirit and sentiments.

These familiar texts are quoted by clergymen in their pulpits, by
statesmen in the halls of legislation, by lawyers in the courts, and are
echoed by the press of all civilized nations, and accepted by woman
herself as "The Word of God." So perverted is the religious element in
her nature, that with faith and works she is the chief support of the
church and clergy; the very powers that make her emancipation
impossible. When, in the early part of the Nineteenth Century, women
began to protest against their civil and political degradation, they
were referred to the Bible for an answer. When they protested against
their unequal position in the church, they were referred to the Bible
for an answer.

This led to a general and critical study of the Scriptures. Some, having
made a fetish of these books and believing them to be the veritable
"Word of God," with liberal translations, interpretations, allegories
and symbols, glossed over the most objectionable features of the various
books and clung to them as divinely inspired. Others, seeing the family
resemblance between the Mosaic code, the canon law, and the old English
common law, came to the conclusion that all alike emanated from the same
source; wholly human in their origin and inspired by the natural love of
domination in the historians. Others, bewildered with their doubts and
fears, came to no conclusion. While their clergymen told them on the one
hand, that they owed all the blessings and freedom they enjoyed to the
Bible, on the other, they said it clearly marked out their circumscribed
sphere of action: that the demands for political and civil rights were
irreligious, dangerous to the stability of the home, the state and the
church. Clerical appeals were circulated from

{p. 90}

time to time. conjuring members of their churches to take no, part in
the anti-slavery or woman suffrage movements, as they were infidel in
their tendencies, undermining the very foundations of society. No wonder
the majority of women stood still, and with bowed heads, accepted the
situation.

Listening to the varied opinions of women, I have long thought it would
be interesting and profitable to get them clearly stated in book form.
To this end six years ago I proposed to a committee of women to issue a
Woman's Bible, that we might have women's commentaries on women's
position in the Old and New Testaments. It was agreed on by several
leading women in England and America and the work was begun, but from
various causes it has been delayed, until now the idea is received with
renewed enthusiasm, and a large committee has been formed, and we hope
to complete the work within a year.

Those who have undertaken the labor are desirous to have some Hebrew and
Greek scholars, versed in Biblical criticism, to gild our pages with
their learning. Several distinguished women have been urged to do so,
but they are afraid that their high reputation and scholarly attainments
might be compromised by taking part in an enterprise that for a time may
prove very unpopular. Hence we may not be able to get help from that
class.

Others fear that they might compromise their evangelical faith by
affiliating with those of more liberal views, who do not regard the
Bible as the "Word of God," but like any other book, to be judged by its
merits. If the Bible teaches the equality of Woman, why does the church
refuse to ordain women to preach the gospel, to fill the offices of
deacons and elders, and to administer the Sacraments, or to admit them
as delegates to the Synods, General Assemblies and Conferences of the
different denominations? They have never yet invited a woman to join one
of their Revising Committees, nor tried to mitigate the sentence
pronounced on her by changing one count in the indictment served on her
in Paradise.

{p. 10}

The large number of letters received, highly appreciative of the
undertaking, is very encouraging to those who have inaugurated the
movement, and indicate a growing self-respect and self-assertion in the
women of this generation. But we have the usual array of objectors to
meet and answer. One correspondent conjures us to suspend the work, as
it is "ridiculous" for "women to attempt the revision of the
Scriptures." I wonder if any man wrote to the late revising committee of
Divines to stop their work on the ground that it was ridiculous for men
to revise the Bible. Why is it more ridiculous for women to protest
against her present status in the Old and New Testament, in the
ordinances and discipline of the church, than in the statutes and
constitution of the state? Why is it more ridiculous to arraign
ecclesiastics for their false teaching and acts of injustice to women,
than members of Congress and the House of Commons? Why is it more
audacious to review Moses than Blackstone, the Jewish code of laws, than
the English system of jurisprudence? Women have compelled their
legislators in every state in this Union to so modify their statutes for
women that the old common law is now almost a dead letter. Why not
compel Bishops and Revising Committees to modify their creeds and
dogmas? Forty years ago it seemed as ridiculous to timid, time-serving
and retrograde folk for women to demand an expurgated edition of the
laws, as it now does to demand an expurgated edition of the Liturgies
and the Scriptures. Come, come, my conservative friend, wipe the dew off
your spectacles, and see that the world is moving. Whatever your views
may be as to the importance of the proposed work, your political and
social degradation are but an outgrowth of your status in the Bible.
When you express your aversion, based on a blind feeling of reverence in
which reason has no control, to the revision of the Scriptures, you do
but echo Cowper, who, when asked to read Paine's "Rights of Man,"
exclaimed "No man shall convince me that I am improperly governed while
I *feel* the contrary."

Others say it is not *politic* to rouse religious opposition.

{p. 11}

This much-lauded policy is but another word for cowardice. How can
woman's position be changed from that of a subordinate to an equal,
without opposition, without the broadest discussion of all the questions
involved in her present degradation? For so far-reaching and momentous a
reform as her complete independence, an entire revolution in all
existing institutions is inevitable.

Let us remember that all reforms are interdependent, and that whatever
is done to establish one principle on a solid basis, strengthens all.
Reformers who are always compromising, have not yet grasped the idea
that truth is the only safe ground to stand upon. The object of an
individual life is not to carry one fragmentary measure in human
progress, but to utter the highest truth clearly seen in all directions,
and thus to round out and perfect a well balanced character. Was not the
sum of influence exerted by John Stuart Mill on political, religious and
social questions far greater than that of any statesman or reformer who
has sedulously limited his sympathies and activities to carrying one
specific measure? We have many women abundantly endowed with
capabilities to understand and revise what men have thus far written.
But they are all suffering from inherited ideas of their inferiority;
they do not perceive it, yet such is the true explanation of their
solicitude, lest they should seem to be too self-asserting.

Again there are some who write us that our work is a useless expenditure
of force over a book that has lost its hold on the human mind. Most
intelligent women, they say, regard it simply as the history of a rude
people in a barbarous age, and have no more reverence for the Scriptures
than any other work. So long as tens of thousands of Bibles are printed
every year, and circulated over the whole habitable globe, and the
masses in all English-speaking nations revere it as the word of God, it
is vain to belittle its influence. The sentimental feelings we all have
for those things we were educated to believe sacred, do not readily
yield to pure reason. I distinctly remember the shudder that passed over
me on seeing a mother take our family Bible to

{p. 12}

make a high seat for her child at table. It seemed such a desecration. I
was tempted to protest against its use for such a purpose, and this,
too, long after my reason had repudiated its divine authority.

To women still believing in the plenary inspiration of the Scriptures,
we say give us by all means your exegesis in the light of the higher
criticism learned men are now making, and illumine the Woman's Bible,
with your inspiration.

Bible historians claim special inspiration for the Old and New
Testaments containing most contradictory records of the same events, of
miracles opposed to all known laws, of customs that degrade the female
sex of all human and animal life, stated in most questionable language
that could not be read in a promiscuous assembly, and call all this "The
Word of God."

The only points in which I differ from all ecclesiastical teaching is
that I do not believe that any man ever saw or talked with God, I do not
believe that God inspired the Mosaic code, or told the historians what
they say he did about woman, for all the religions on the face of the
earth degrade her, and so long as woman accepts the position that they
assign her, her emancipation is impossible. Whatever the Bible may be
made to do in Hebrew or Greek, in plain English it does not exalt and
dignify woman. My standpoint for criticism is the revised edition of
1888. 1 will so far honor the revising committee of wise men who have
given us the best exegesis they can according to their ability, although
Disraeli said the last one before he died, contained 150,000 blunders in
the Hebrew, and 7,000 in the Greek.

But the verbal criticism in regard to woman's position amounts to
little. The spirit is the same in all periods and languages, hostile to
her as an equal.

There are some general principles in the holy books of all religions
that teach love, charity, liberty, justice and equality for all the
human family, there are many grand and beautiful passages, the golden
rule has been echoed and re-echoed around the world. There are lofty
examples of good and true men

{p. 13}

and women, all worthy our acceptance and imitation whose lustre cannot
be dimmed by the false sentiments and vicious characters bound up in the
same volume. The Bible cannot be accepted or rejected as a whole, its
teachings are varied and its lessons differ widely from each other. In
criticising the peccadilloes of Sarah, Rebecca and Rachel, we would not
shadow the virtues of Deborah, Huldah and Vashti. In criticising the
Mosaic code, we would not question the wisdom of the golden rule and the
fifth Commandment. Again the church claims special consecration for its
cathedrals and priesthood, parts of these aristocratic churches are too
holy for women to enter, boys were early introduced into the choirs for
this reason, woman singing in an obscure corner closely veiled. A few of
the more democratic denominations accord women some privileges, but
invidious discriminations of sex are found in all religious
organizations, and the most bitter outspoken enemies of woman are found
among clergymen and bishops of the Protestant religion.\[\*\]

The canon law, the Scriptures, the creeds and codes and church
discipline of the leading religions bear the impress of fallible man,
and not of our ideal great first cause, "the Spirit of all Good," that
set the universe of matter and mind in motion, and by immutable law
holds the land, the sea, the planets, revolving round the great centre
of light and heat, each in its own elliptic, with millions of stars in
harmony all singing together, the glory of creation forever and ever.
