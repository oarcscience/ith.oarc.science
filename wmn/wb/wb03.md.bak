# THE BOOK OF GENESIS.

## CHAPTER I.

*Genesis i: 26, 27, 28.*

26 ¶ And God said, Let us make man in our image after our likeness: and
let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth 27 So God created man in his
own image, in the image of God created he him: male and female image,
created he them.

28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living
thing that moveth upon the earth.

HERE is the sacred historian's first account of the advent of woman; a
simultaneous creation of both sexes, in the image of God. It is evident
from the language that there was consultation in the Godhead, and that
the masculine and feminine elements were equally represented. Scott in
his commentaries says, "this consultation of the Gods is the origin of
the doctrine of the trinity." But instead of three male personages, as
generally represented, a Heavenly Father, Mother, and Son would seem
more rational.

The first step in the elevation of woman to her true position, as an
equal factor in human progress, is the cultivation of the religious
sentiment in regard to her dignity and equality, the recognition by the
rising generation of an ideal Heavenly Mother, to whom their prayers
should be addressed, as well as to a Father.

If language has any meaning, we have in these texts a plain declaration
of the existence of the feminine element in the Godhead, equal in power
and glory with the masculine. The Heavenly Mother and Father! "God
created man in his

own

{p. 15}

image, male and female." Thus Scripture, as well as science and
philosophy, declares the eternity and equality of sex--the philosophical
fact, without which there could have been no perpetuation of creation,
no growth or development in the animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdoms,
no awakening nor progressing in the world of thought. The masculine and
feminine elements, exactly equal and balancing each other, are as
essential to the maintenance of the equilibrium of the universe as
positive and negative electricity, the centripetal and centrifugal
forces, the laws of attraction which bind together all we know of this
planet whereon we dwell and of the system in which we revolve.

In the great work of creation the crowning glory was realized, when man
and woman were evolved on the sixth day, the masculine and feminine
forces in the image of God, that must have existed eternally, in all
forms of matter and mind. All the persons in the Godhead are represented
in the Elohim the divine plurality taking counsel in regard to this last
and highest form of life. Who were the members of this high council, and
were they a duality or a trinity? Verse 27 declares the image of God
male and female. How then is it possible to make woman an afterthought?
We find in verses 5-16 the pronoun "he" used. Should it not in harmony
with verse 26 be "they," a dual pronoun? We may attribute this to the
same cause as the use of "his" in verse 11 instead of "it." The fruit
tree yielding fruit after "his" kind instead of after "its" kind. The
paucity of a language may give rise to many misunderstandings.

The above texts plainly show the simultaneous creation of man and woman,
and their equal importance in the development of the race. All those
theories based on the assumption that man was prior in the creation,
have no foundation in Scripture.

As to woman's subjection, on which both the canon and the civil law
delight to dwell, it is important to note that equal dominion is given
to woman over every living thing, but not one word is said giving man
dominion over woman.

{p. 14}

Here is the first title deed to this green earth giving alike to the
sons and daughters of God. No lesson of woman's subjection can be fairly
drawn from the first chapter of the Old Testament.

E. C. S.

The most important thing for a woman to note, in reading Genesis, is
that that portion which is now divided into "the first three chapters"
(there was no such division until about five centuries ago), contains
two entirely separate, and very contradictory, stories of creation,
written by two different, but equally anonymous, authors. No Christian
theologian of to-day, with any pretensions to scholarship, claims that
Genesis was written by Moses. As was long ago pointed out, the Bible
itself declares that all the books the Jews originally possessed were
burned in the destruction of Jerusalem, about 588 B. C., at the time the
people were taken to Babylonia as slaves too the Assyrians, (see II
Esdras, ch. xiv, V. 21, Apocrypha). Not until about 247 B. C. (some
theologians say 226 and others; 169 B. C.) is there any record of a
collection of literature in the re-built Jerusalem, and, then, the
anonymous writer of II Maccabees briefly mentions that some Nehemiah
"gathered together the acts of the kings and the prophets and those of
David" when "founding a library" for use in Jerusalem. But the earliest
mention anywhere in the Bible of a book that might have corresponded to
Genesis is made by an apocryphal writer, who says that Ezra wrote "all
that hath been done in the world since the beginning," after the Jews
returned from Babylon, under his leadership, about 450 B. C. (see II
Esdras, ch. xiv, v. 22, of the Apocrypha).

When it is remembered that the Jewish books were written on rolls of
leather, without much attention to vowel points and with no division
into verses or chapters, by uncritical copyists, who altered passages
greatly, and did not always even pretend to understand what they were
copying, then the reader of Genesis begins to put herself in position to
understand how it

{p. 17}

can be contradictory. Great as were the liberties which the Jews took
with Genesis, those of the English translators, however, greatly
surpassed them.

The first chapter of Genesis, for instance, in Hebrew, tells us, in
verses one and two, "As to origin, created the gods (Elohim) these skies
(or air or clouds) and this earth. . . And a wind moved upon the face of
the waters." Here we have the opening of a polytheistic fable of
creation, but, so strongly convinced were the English translators that
the ancient Hebrews must have been originally monotheistic that they
rendered the above, as follows: "In the beginning God created the heaven
and the earth. . . . And the spirit of God (!) moved upon the face of
the waters."

It is now generally conceded that some one (nobody pretends to know who)
at some time (nobody pretends to know exactly when), copied two creation
myths on the same leather roll, one immediately following the other.
About one hundred years ago, it was discovered by Dr. Astruc, of France,
that from Genesis ch. i, v. 1 to Genesis ch. ii, v. 4, is given one
complete account of creation, by an author who always used the term "the
gods" (*Elohim*), in speaking of the fashioning of the universe,
mentioning it altogether thirty-four times, while, in Genesis ch. ii, v.
4, to the end of chapter iii, we have a totally different narrative, by
an author of unmistakably different style, who uses the term "Iahveh of
the gods" twenty times, but "Elohim" only three times. The first author,
evidently, attributes creation to a council of gods, acting in concert,
and seems never to have heard of Iahveh. The second attributes creation
to Iahveh, a tribal god of ancient Israel, but represents Iahveh as one
of two or more gods, conferring with them (in Genesis ch. xiii, V. 22)
as to the danger of man's acquiring immortality.

Modern theologians have, for convenience sake, entitled these two
fables, respectively, the Elohistic and the Iahoistic stories. They
differ, not only in the point I have mentioned above, but in the order
of the "creative acts;" in regard to the mutual attitude of man and
woman, and in regard to human freedom from

{p. 18}

prohibitions imposed by deity. In order to exhibit their striking
contradictions, I will place them in parallel columns:

Now as it is manifest that both of these stories cannot be true;
intelligent women, who feel bound to give the preference to either, may
decide according to their own judgment of which is more worthy of an
intelligent woman's acceptance. Paul's rule is a good one in this
dilemma, "Prove all things: hold fast to that which is good." My own
opinion is that the second story was manipulated by some Jew, in an
endeavor to give "heavenly authority" for requiring a woman to obey the
man she married. In a work which I am now completing, I give some facts
concerning ancient Israelitish history, which will be of peculiar
interest to those who wish to understand the origin of woman's
subjection.

E. B. D.

{p. 19}

Many orientalists and students of theology have maintained that the
consultation of the Gods here described is proof that the Hebrews were
in early days polytheists--Scott's supposition that this is the origin
of the Trinity has no foundation in fact, as the beginning of that
conception is to be found in the earliest of all known religious nature
worship. The acknowledgment of the dual principal, masculine and
feminine, is much more probably the explanation of the expressions here
used.

In the detailed description of creation we find a gradually ascending
series. Creeping things, "great sea monsters," (chap. I, V. 21, literal
translation). "Every bird of wing," cattle and living things of the
earth, the fish of the sea and the "birds of the heavens," then man, and
last and crowning glory of the whole, woman.

It cannot be maintained that woman was inferior to man even if, as
asserted in chapter ii, she was created after him without at once
admitting that man is inferior to the creeping things, because created
after them.
