<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">PREFACE</H2>
<P>The interest my family and friends have always manifested in the narration of my early and varied experiences, and their earnest desire to have them in permanent form for the</P>
<P>{p. 154}</P>
<P>amusement of another generation, moved me to publish this volume. I am fully aware that its contents have no especial artistic merit, being composed partly of extracts from my diary, a few hasty sketches of my travels and people I have met, and of my opinions on many social questions.</P>
<P>The story of my private life as the wife of an earnest reformer, as an enthusiastic housekeeper, proud of my skill in every department of domestic economy, and as the mother of seven children., may amuse and benefit the reader.</P>
<P>The incidents of my public career as a leader in the most momentous reform yet launched upon the world-the emancipation of woman-will be found in "The History of Woman Suffrage."</P>
<P>New York City, September, 1897&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ELIZABETH CADY STANTON.</P>
<P>Mrs. Stanton in this book, in her inimitable way, relates anecdotes of, and experiences with, a number of the leading women, statesmen, authors, and reformers of the last sixty years. The following are a few names selected at random from the</P>

<P>It is one of the most important books of the year, Particularly to the women of this country. It is absorbingly interesting. The trouble that the reader encounters is that he finds it hard work to lay the book down.--Boston <I>Daily Advertiser</I>.</P>

This is a most interesting volume.--N. Y. <I>Times</I>.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">PRESS COMMENTS--(Continued).</P>
<P>The story of Mrs. Stanton's life is one which interests many thousands in this country, and which will also be read with interest in other lands, for her reputation as a reformer and writer is international; her strong personal characteristics give to this autobiographical work a charm of its own. It contains some of the most entertaining reminiscences that have been given to the public. It is a book which is sure to be widely read.--Worcester <I>Spy</I>.</P>
<P>The personal element is the fascinating part of the book which holds one's attention and keeps him reading to the end. It is a bright, breezy, and radical turn-the-world-upside-down book. We do not like its religious tone. We do not like the author's occult theosophy. We do not like her sociology, with its good word for the windmill logic of the speculative Bellamy. We do not like her views of marriage and divorce. But when all is said, and with all these wide differences lying between us to qualify our enjoyment of this book, we have enjoyed it much. Mrs. Stanton is a first-rate raconteuse and fills her pages with amusing recitals and brilliant encounters--N. Y. <I>Independent</I>.</P>

<H5 ALIGN="CENTER">ON THE</H5>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">WOMAN'S BIBLE</H2>
<P>The comments are right up to date.--Cincinnati <I>Tribune</I>.</P>
<P>The most humorous book of the year.--The Hartford <I>Seminary Record</I>.</P>
<P>Of all possible books this is perhaps the most extraordinary possible.--<I>The Week</I>, Toronto, Canada.</P>
<P>A very clever analysis of passages relating to the sex.--<I>Public Opinion</I>, N. Y. City.</P>
<P>The new Woman s Bible is one of the remarkable productions of the century.--Denver <I>News</I>.</P>
<P>A unique edition of the Scripture. An extraordinary presentment of Holy Writ!--Denver <I>Times</I>.</P>
<P>The work is unique. Its aim is to help the cause of woman in her battle for equality.--<I>Beacon</I>, Akron, Ohio.</P>
<P>Robert G. Ingersoll is the only person on earth capable of a work equal to Mrs. Stanton's sensation, "The Woman's Bible."--Chicago <I>Times-Herald</I>.</P>
<P>The attack of the new woman on the King James Bible will be observed with interest where it does not alarm. But let "The Woman's Bible" and the truth prevail. It may be that Lot himself was turned into a pillar of salt.--Chicago <I>Post</I>.</P>
<P>It has come at last, as it was bound to come--the emancipated woman's Bible. The wonder is it has been delayed so long. This is not a blasphemous book.--The <I>Egyptian Gazette</I>, Alexandria, Egypt.</P>
<P>The "new woman" has broken out in a fresh direction and published "The Woman's Bible." In it the conduct of Adam, the father of the race, is described as "to the last degree dastardly."--Westminster <I>Budget</I>, London, Eng.</P>
<P>One of the most striking protests devised by woman for the purpose of showing her rejection of the conditions under which our mothers lived. It is evidently the mission of "The Woman's Bible" to exalt and dignify woman.--<I>The Morning</I>, London, Eng.</P>
<P>We have read some of the passages of</P>
<P>the commentary prepared for "the Woman's Bible" by that very accomplished American woman and Biblical student, Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton. They are a great deal more satisfactory than many of the comments upon the same texts that we have read in other and more pretentious Commentaries. Mrs. Stanton's interpretative remarks are shrewd and sensible--Editorial N. Y. <I>Sun</I>.</P>
<P>Of man-made commentaries on the Bible we have had sufficient to stock a library and yet they have left room for this commentary by women. These revisers have proved the need of an intelligent examination of the Scriptures from the woman's point of view. The lady commentators are not wanting in a sense of humor--the quality in which biblical critics of the male sex are usually unhappily deficient. There is much that is very funny and very interesting in this new commentary upon the Bible.--<I>The Daily Chronicle</I>, London, Eng.</P>
<P>The <I>Standard</I> says, "The Sisterhood of Advanced Women has taken a bold step towards emancipation. It has long groaned under certain implications of servitude contained in a few passages of Scripture, and has, therefore, determined to abolish these disabilities by publishing 'The Woman's Bible.'" It is not only the type that is new. New readings of old passages are given, and the volume contains suggestions to show that the verses about women's inferiority really mean the opposite of the ordinary acceptation. In it Eve is rather praised than otherwise for having eaten the apple. It is pointed out that Satan did not tempt her with an array of silks and satins, and gold watches, or even a cycling costume--the things which some people think most seductive to her descendants--but with the offer of knowledge; a man being of such a lethargic and groveling nature that a similar lofty ambition never entered his mind. Besides, if the fruit was not to be eaten, Eve should have been informed of the fact at first hand, and not through an agent.--<I>Pall Mall Gazette</I>, London, Eng.</P>
