#### FOURTH LESSON.

A mendicant who is fitted out with three robes <span
id="fr_271"></span>[3](#fn_268), and a bowl as fourth (article.md), will
not think: I shall beg

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

for a fourth robe. He should beg for (clothes) which he wants, and which
are permitted by the religious code <span
id="fr_272"></span>[1](#fn_269.md); he should wear the clothes in the same
state in which they are given him; he should neither wash nor dye them,
nor should he wear washed or dyed clothes, nor (should he) hide (his
garments when passing) through other villages, being careless of dress.
This is the whole duty <span id="fr_273"></span>[2](#fn_270.md) of one who
wears clothes. But know further, that, after winter is gone and the hot
season has come, one should leave off the used-up (garment of the
three), being clad with an upper and under garment, or with the
undermost garment, or with one gown, or with no clothes--aspiring to
freedom from bonds <span id="fr_274"></span>[3](#fn_271.md). Penance suits
him. Knowing what the Revered One has declared, one should thoroughly
and in all respects conform to it. (1)

When it occurs to a blessed <span id="fr_275"></span>[4](#fn_272.md)
mendicant that he suffers pain, and cannot bear the influence of cold,
he should not try to obviate these trials, but stand fast in his own
self which is endowed with all knowledge <span
id="fr_276"></span>[5](#fn_273.md). 'For it is better for an ascetic that
he should take poison.' Even thus he will in due time put an end to
existence. This (way to escape trials) has been adopted by many who were

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

free from delusion; it is good, wholesome, proper, beatifying,
meritorious. Thus I say. (2)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_266"></span>[67:1](sbe2237.htm#fr_269.md) The latter part of
this paragraph is nearly identical with lecture 2, lesson 5, § 3, to
which we refer the reader for the explanation of the dark phrases.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[67:2](sbe2237.htm#fr_270.md) The original has
fire-body, which the faithful are enjoined not to injure; see lecture 2,
lesson 4.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[67:3](sbe2238.htm#fr_271.md) The three robes
allowed to a *G*aina monk are two linen under garments (kshaumikakalpa)
and one woollen upper garment (aur*n*ikakalpa). Besides these
(kalpatraya), the monk possesses, 2. an alms-bowl (pâtra) with six
things belonging to it, 3. a broom (ra*g*ohara*n*a), 4. a veil for the
mouth (mukhavastrikâ). The alms-bowl and the articles belonging to it
are specialised in the following gâthâ: patta*m* pattâba*m*dho
pâya*tth*ava*n*a*m* *k*a pâyakesariyâ \| pa*d*alâi rayattâ*n*a*m* *k*a
go*kkh*ao pâyani*gg*ogo \|\|

<span id="fn_269"></span>[68:1](sbe2238.htm#fr_272.md) Things, &c.: this is
the meaning of the technical term ahesa*n*i*gg*a yathaisha*n*îya,
allowed objects of begging.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[68:2](sbe2238.htm#fr_273.md) Literally, outfit.
Cf. II, 5, 2, § 1.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[68:3](sbe2238.htm#fr_274.md) I.e. freedom from
worldly cares and interest.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[68:4](sbe2238.htm#fr_275.md) Vasuma*m*: rich (in
control).

<span id="fn_273"></span>[68:5](sbe2238.htm#fr_276.md) But he should not,
in order to escape these trials, commit such suicide as is only
permitted to ascetics who have reached the highest degree of perfection,
when they are ripe for Nirvâ*n*a. Suicide only puts off the last
struggle for Nirvâ*n*a; but it is better than breaking the vow.
