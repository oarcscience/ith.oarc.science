### LIFE OF ARISH*T*ANEMI.

In that period, in that age lived the Arhat Arish*t*anemi, the five most
important moments of whose life happened when the moon was in
conjunction with the asterism *K*itrâ. In *K*itrâ he descended from
heaven, &c. (see § 149, down to) obtained final liberation. (1 70)

In that period, in that age, in the fourth month of the rainy season, in
the seventh fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of Kârttika, on its twelfth
day, the Arhat Arish*t*anemi descended from the great Vimâna, called
Aparâ*g*ita, where he had lived for thirty-six Sâgaropamas, here on the
continent *G*ambûdvîpa, in Bharatavarsha, in the town of
*S*auripura <span id="fr_659"></span>[1](#fn_652.md), and in the middle of
the night when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism *K*itrâ, he
took the form of an embryo in the womb of the queen *S*ivâ, wife of the
king Samudravi*g*aya, &c. (the seeing of the dreams, the accumulation of
riches, &c., should be repeated here). (171)

In that period, in that age the Arhat Arish*t*anemi--after the lapse of
nine months and seven and a half days, in the first month of the rainy
season, in the second fortnight, the light (fortnight) of *S*râva*n*a,
on its fifth day, &c.--(*S*ivâ), perfectly healthy herself; gave birth
to a perfectly healthy boy. (Repeat the account of the birth,
substituting the name Samudravi*g*aya,

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

all down to) therefore shall the name of our boy be Arish*t*anemi <span
id="fr_660"></span>[1](#fn_653.md).

The Arhat Arish*t*anemi, clever, &c. (see §§ 155157, all down to)
indigent persons. (172) In the first month of the rainy season, in the
second fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Srâva*n*a, on its sixth day
riding in his palankin called Uttarakurâ, and followed on his way by a
train of gods, men, and Asuras, &c. (Arish*t*anemi) went right through
the town of Dvârâvatî to the park called Revatîka, and proceeded to the
excellent A*s*oka tree. There, &c. (see § 116, down to) five handfuls.
When the moon was in conjunction with the asterism *K*itrâ, after
fasting two and a half days without drinking water, he put on a divine
robe, and together with a thousand persons he tore out his hair, and
leaving the house entered the state of houselessness. (173)

The Arhat Arish*t*anemi for fifty-four days neglected his body, &c. (see
§§ 117-120). During the fifty-fifth day--it was in the third month of
the rainy season, in the fifth fortnight, the dark fortnight of
Â*s*vina, on its fifteenth day, in the last part of the day, when the
moon was in conjunction with the asterism *K*itrâ--(Arish*t*anemi) under
a Ve*t*asa <span id="fr_661"></span>[2](#fn_654.md) tree on the summit of
mount Girnâr <span id="fr_662"></span>[3](#fn_655.md), after fasting three
and a half days without drinking water, &c., obtained infinite, &c.,
highest knowledge and intuition called Kevala, &c. (see § 121, down to)
moment. (174)

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

The Arhat Arish*t*anemi had eighteen Ga*n*as and eighteen Ga*n*adharas.
(175)

The Arhat Arish*t*anemi had an excellent community of eighteen thousand
*S*rama*n*as with Varadatta at their head; (176) forty thousand nuns
with Ârya Yakshi*n*î at their head; (177) one hundred and sixty-nine
thousand lay votaries with Nanda at their head; (178) three hundred and
thirty-six thousand <span id="fr_663"></span>[1](#fn_656.md) female lay
votaries with Mahâsuvratâ at their head; (179) four hundred sages who
knew the fourteen Pûrvas, &c.; (180) fifteen hundred sages who were
possessed of the Avadhi knowledge; fifteen hundred Kevalins; fifteen
hundred sages who could transform themselves; one thousand sages of vast
intellect; eight hundred professors; sixteen hundred sages in their last
birth; fifteen hundred male and three thousand female disciples who had
reached perfection.

The Arhat Arish*t*anemi instituted, &c. (see § 146, down to) the former
ended in the eighth generation, the latter in the twelfth year of his
Kevaliship. (181)

In that period, in that age the Arhat Arish*t*anemi lived three
centuries as a prince, fifty-four days in a state inferior to
perfection, something less than seven centuries as a Kevalin, full seven
centuries as a *S*rama*n*a, a thousand years on the whole. When his
fourfold Karman was exhausted and in this Avasarpi*n*î era a great part
of the Du*h*shamasushamâ period had elapsed, in the fourth month of
summer, in the eighth fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Ashâ*dh*a, on
its eighth day, in the middle of the night when the moon was in
conjunction with the asterism *K*itrâ, (Arish*t*anemi), after fasting a
month

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

without drinking water, on the summit of mount Girnâr, in the company of
five hundred and thirty-six monks, in a squatting position, died, &c.
(all down to) freed from all pains. (182)

Since the time that the Arhat Arish*t*anemi died, &c. (all down to)
freed from all pains, eighty-four thousand years have elapsed, of the
eighty-fifth millennium nine centuries have elapsed, of the tenth
century this is the eightieth year. (183)

dream a nemi, the outer rim of a wheel, which consisted of rish*t*a
stones flying up to the sky. Hence the name Arish*t*anemi.
