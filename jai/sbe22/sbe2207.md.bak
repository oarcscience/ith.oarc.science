#### FIFTH LESSON <span id="fr_107"></span>[1](#fn_106.md).

'I shall not do (acts relating to plants) after having entered the
order, having recognised (the truth about these acts), and having
conceived that which is free from danger (i.e. control).'

He who does no acts (relating to plants), has ceased from works; he who
has ceased from them is called 'houseless.' (1) Quality is the whirlpool
(âva*tt*a = sa*m*sâra), and the whirlpool is quality. Looking up, down,
aside, eastward, he sees colours, hearing he hears sounds; (2) longing
upwards, down, aside, eastward, he becomes attached to colours and
sounds. That is called the world; not guarded against it, not obeying
the law (of the Tîrthakaras), relishing the qualities, conducting
himself wrongly, he will wantonly live in a house (i.e. belong to the
world). (3)

See! there are men who control themselves; others pretend only to be
houseless, for one destroys this (body of a plant) by bad and injurious
doings, and many other

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

beings, besides, which he hurts by means of plants, through his doing
acts relating to plants. (4) About this the Revered One has taught the
truth: for the sake of the splendour, honour, and glory of this life,
for the sake of birth, death, and final liberation, for the removal of
pain, man acts sinfully towards plants, or causes others to act so, or
allows others to act so. This deprives him of happiness and perfect
wisdom. About this he is informed when he has understood, or heard from
the Revered One or from the monks, the faith to be coveted. There are
some who, of a truth, know this (i.e. injuring) to be the bondage, the
delusion, the death, the hell. For this a man is longing when he
destroys this (body of a plant) by bad and injurious doings, and many
other beings, besides, which he hurts by means of plants, through his
doing acts relating to plants. Thus I say. (5)

As the nature of this (i.e. men) is to be born and to grow old, so is
the nature of that (i.e. plants) to be born and to grow old; as this has
reason, so that has reason <span id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_107.md); as
this falls sick when cut, so that falls sick when cut; as this needs
food, so that needs food; as this will decay, so that will decay; as
this is not eternal, so that is not eternal; as this takes increment, so
that takes increment; as this is changing, so that is changing. (6) He
who injures these (plants) does not comprehend and renounce the sinful

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

acts; he who does not injure these, comprehends and renounces the sinful
acts. Knowing them, a wise man should not act sinfully towards plants,
nor cause others to act so, nor allow others to act so. He who knows
these causes of sin relating to plants, is called a reward-knowing sage.
Thus I say. (7)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_106"></span>[9:1](sbe2207.htm#fr_107.md) The discussion of the
'wind-bodies,' which should follow that of the fire-bodies, is postponed
for two lessons in which the vegetable and animal world is treated of.
The reason for this interruption of the line of exposition is, as the
commentators state, that the nature of wind, because of its
invisibleness, is open to doubts, whilst plants and animals are admitted
by all to be living beings, and are, therefore, the best support of the
hylozoistical theory. That wind was not readily admitted by the ancient
Indians to be a peculiar substance may still be recognised in the
philosophical Sûtras of the Brahmans. For there it was thought necessary
to discuss at length the proofs for the existence of a peculiar
substance, wind. It should be remarked that wind was never identified
with air, and that the Gainas had not yet separated air from space.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[10:1](sbe2207.htm#fr_108.md) The plants know the
seasons, for they sprout at the proper time, the A*s*oka buds and blooms
when touched by the foot of a well-attired girl, and the Vakula when
watered with wine; the seed grows always upwards: all this would not
happen if the plants had no knowledge of the circumstances about them.
Such is the reasoning of the commentators.
