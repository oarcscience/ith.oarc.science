### THIRD LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### HOT AND COLD.

#### FIRST LESSON.

The unwise sleep, the sages always wake. Know, that in this world the
(cause of) misery <span id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_152) brings forth
evil consequences! Knowing the course of the world <span
id="fr_154"></span>[2](#fn_153), one should cease from violent acts. He
who correctly possesses <span id="fr_155"></span>[3](#fn_154) these
(sensual perceptions), viz. sounds, and colours, and smells, and tastes,
and touches (1), who self-possessed, wise, just, chaste, with right
comprehension understands the world, he is to be called a sage, one who
knows the law, and righteous. He knows the connection of the whirl (of
births) and the current (of sensation with love and hate). Not minding
heat and cold, equanimous against pleasure and pain, the Nirgrantha does
not feel the austerity of penance. Waking and free from hostility, a
wise man, thou liberatest (thyself and others) from the miseries. (2)

But a man always benighted, subject to old age and death, does not know
the law. Seeing living beings suffering, earnestly enter a religious
life <span id="fr_156"></span>[4](#fn_155). Considering this, O prudent
one, look!

Knowing the misery that results from action,  
The deluded and careless one returns to life;

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Disregarding
sounds and colours, upright,  
Avoiding Mâra one is liberated from death <span
id="fr_157"></span>[1](sbe2217.htm#fn_156).

Carefully abstaining from pleasures and ceasing from bad works he is a
hero, guarding himself, who is grounded in knowledge <span
id="fr_158"></span>[2](sbe2217.htm#fn_157). (3) He who knows the
violence done for the sake of special objects, knows what is free from
violence <span id="fr_159"></span>[3](sbe2217.htm#fn_158); he who knows
what is free from violence, knows the violence done for special objects.
For him who is without karman, there is no appellation <span
id="fr_160"></span>[4](sbe2217.htm#fn_159). The condition of living
beings arises from karman.

Examining karman and the root of karman, viz. killing <span
id="fr_161"></span>[5](sbe2217.htm#fn_160), examining (it) and adopting
its contrary <span id="fr_162"></span>[6](sbe2217.htm#fn_161), he is not
seen by both ends <span id="fr_163"></span>[7](sbe2217.htm#fn_162).
Knowing this, a wise man who knows the world and has cast off the idea
of the world, should prudently conquer the obstructions to
righteousness <span id="fr_164"></span>[8](sbe2217.htm#fn_163). Thus I
say. (4)
