#### THIRD LESSON.

Always well guarded, he bore the pains (caused by) grass, cold, fire,
flies, and gnats; manifold pains. (1)

He travelled in the pathless country of the Lâ*dh*as, in Va*gg*abhûmi
and Subbhabhûmi <span id="fr_313"></span>[1](#fn_309.md); he used there
miserable beds and miserable seats. (2)

In Lâ*dh*a (happened) to him many dangers. Many natives attacked him.
Even in the faithful part of the rough country <span
id="fr_314"></span>[2](#fn_310) the dogs bit him, ran at him. (3.md)

Few people kept off the attacking, biting dogs. Striking the monk, they
cried '*Kh*u*kkh*û,' and made the dogs bite him. (4)

Such were the inhabitants. Many other mendicants, eating rough food in
Va*gg*abhûmi, and carrying about a strong pole or a stalk (to keep off
the dogs), lived there. (5)

Even thus armed they were bitten by the dogs, torn by the dogs. It is
difficult to travel in Lâ*dh*a. (6)

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

Ceasing to use the stick (i.e. cruelty) against living beings,
abandoning the care of the body, the houseless (Mahâvîra), the Venerable
One, endures the thorns of the villages (i.e. the abusive language of
the peasants), (being) perfectly enlightened. (7)

As an elephant at the head of the battle, so was Mahâvîra there
victorious. Sometimes he did not reach a village there in Lâ*dh*a. (8)

When he who is free from desires approached the village, the inhabitants
met him on the outside, and attacked him, saying, 'Get away from here.'
(9)

He was struck with a stick, the fist, a lance, hit with a fruit, a clod,
a potsherd. Beating him again and again, many cried. (10)

When he once (sat) without moving his body, they cut his flesh <span
id="fr_315"></span>[1](#fn_311.md), tore his hair under pains, or covered
him with dust. (11)

Throwing him up, they let him fall, or disturbed him in his religious
postures; abandoning the care of his body, the Venerable One humbled
himself and bore pain, free from desire. (1 2)

As a hero at the head of the battle is surrounded on all sides <span
id="fr_316"></span>[2](#fn_312.md), so was there Mahâvîra. Bearing all
hardships, the Venerable One, undisturbed, proceeded (on the road to
Nirvâ*n*a). (13)

This is the rule which has often been followed, &c.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_309"></span>[84:1](sbe2245.htm#fr_313.md) Va*g*rabhûmi and
*S*ubhrabhûmi (or *S*vabhrabhûmi) are, according to the commentaries,
the two divisions of Lâ*dh*a. I think that Lâ*dh*a may be identical with
the classical Râ*dh*â or western Bengal and the Lâla of the Buddhists,
the native country of Vi*g*aya, the legendary conqueror of Ceylon.
Subbhabhûmi is probably the country of the Suhmas, who are also
identified with the Râ*dh*as.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[84:2](sbe2245.htm#fr_314.md) The commentator
seems to understand the words lukkhadesie bhatte in the sense: There the
living also was rough; for they used clothes of grass instead of cotton.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[85:1](sbe2245.htm#fr_315.md) Or his mustaches.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[85:2](sbe2245.htm#fr_316.md) Or is on his guard.
