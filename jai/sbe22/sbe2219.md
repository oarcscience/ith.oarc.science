#### FOURTH LESSON.

That man (i.e. the liberated) conquers wrath, pride, deceit, and greed.
This is the doctrine of the Seer who does not injure living beings and
has put an end (to acts and to sa*m*sâra). Preventing

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

propensity to sin destroys former actions. He who knows one thing, knows
all things; and he who knows all things, knows one thing <span
id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_180.md). He who is careless in all respects, is
in danger <span id="fr_183"></span>[2](#fn_181.md); he who is not careless
in all respects, is free from danger. (1)

He who conquers one (passion), conquers many; and he who conquers many,
conquers one. 'Knowing the misery of the world' rejecting the connection
with the world, 'the heroes go on the great journey,' they rise
gradually; 'they do not desire life.' (2)

He who avoids one (passion), avoids (them all) severally; and he who
avoids them severally, avoids one. Faithful according to the commandment
(of the Tîrthakaras), wise, and understanding the world according to the
commandment--such a man is without danger <span
id="fr_184"></span>[2](#fn_181.md) from anywhere. There are degrees in
injurious acts, but there are no degrees in control. (3)

He who knows <span id="fr_185"></span>[3](#fn_182.md) wrath, knows pride;
he who knows pride, knows deceit; he who knows deceit, knows greed; he
who knows greed, knows love; he who knows love, knows hate; he who knows
hate, knows delusion; he who knows delusion, knows conception; he who
knows conception, knows birth; he who knows birth, knows death; he who
knows death, knows hell; he who knows hell, knows animal existence; he
who knows animal existence, knows pain.

Therefore, a wise man should avoid wrath, pride, deceit, greed, love,
hate, delusion, conception, birth, death, hell, animal existence, and
pain.

This is the doctrine of the Seer, who does not injure living beings and
has put an end (to acts and to sa*m*sâra). Preventing the propensity to
sin destroys former actions. Is there any worldly weakness in the Seer?
There exists none, there is none. Thus I say. (4)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_180"></span>[34:1](sbe2219.htm#fr_182.md) Because true
knowledge of one thing is inseparable from true knowledge of all things.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[34:2](sbe2219.htm#fr_184.md) I.e. he heaps up
karman.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[34:3](sbe2219.htm#fr_185.md) And accordingly
avoids wrath.
