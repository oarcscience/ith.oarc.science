### LIST OF THE STHAVIRAS.

At that period, at that age the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra had nine
Ga*n*as and eleven Ga*n*adharas.

'Why, now, has it been said, that the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra had
nine Ga*n*as, but eleven Ga*n*adharas?'

'The oldest monk of the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra was Indrabhûti of the
Gautama gotra, who instructed five hundred *S*rama*n*as; the middle-aged
monk was Agnibhûti of the Gautama gotra, who instructed five hundred
Srama*n*as; the youngest was Vâyubhûti of the Gautama gotra, who
instructed five hundred *S*rama*n*as. The Sthavira Ârya-Vyakta of the
Bhâradvâ*g*a gotra instructed five hundred *S*rama*n*as; the Sthavira
Ârya-Sudharman of the Agnive*s*yâyana gotra instructed five hundred
*S*rama*n*as; the Sthavira Ma*nd*ikaputra <span
id="fr_670"></span>[1](#fn_663.md) of the Vâsish*th*a gotra instructed two
hundred and fifty *S*rama*n*as; the Sthavira Mauryaputra of the
Kâ*s*yapa gotra instructed two hundred and fifty *S*rama*n*as; the
Sthavira Akampita of the Gautama gotra and Sthavira A*k*alabhrât*ri* of
the Hâritâyana gotra, both Sthaviras instructed together three hundred
*S*rama*n*as each; the Sthaviras Metârya and Prabhâsa, both of the
Kau*nd*i*n*ya gotra, instructed together

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

three hundred *S*rama*n*as each <span id="fr_671"></span>[1](#fn_664.md).
Therefore, Sir, has it been said that the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra had
nine Ga*n*as, but eleven Ga*n*adharas: (1)

All these eleven Ga*n*adharas of the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, who
knew the twelve Aṅgas, the fourteen Pûrvas, and the whole Siddhânta of
the Ga*n*ins, died, &c. (all down to) freed from all pains in
Râ*g*ag*ri*ha after fasting a month without drinking water. The
Sthaviras Indrabhûti and Ârya Sudharman both died after the Nirvâ*n*a of
Mahâvira. The Nirgrantha *S*rama*n*as of the present time are all
(spiritual) descendants of the monk Ârya Sudharman, the rest of the
Ga*n*adharas left no descendants. (2)

The Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra was of the Kâ*s*yapa gotra. His disciple
was <span id="fr_672"></span>[2](#fn_665.md):

the Prâ*k*îna gotra;

 14. Ârya Va*g*rasena of the Utk*ri*sh*t*a gotra <span

He had four disciples: Ârya Nâgila, Ârya Padmila, Ârya *G*ayanta, and
Ârya Tâpasa, each of whom founded a *S*âkhâ called after his name, viz.
the Aryanâgilâ *S*âkhâ, the Âryapadmilâ *S*âkhâ, the Ârya*g*ayantî
*S*âkhâ, and the Âryatâpasî *S*âkhâ. (4)

Bowing down my head, I pay my reverence to the Sthavira *G*ambû of the
Gautama gotra, who possessed steady virtue, good conduct, and knowledge.
ix.

I prostrate myself before the Sthavira Nandita of Kâ*s*yapa gotra, who
is possessed of great clemency and of knowledge, intuition, and good
conduct. x.

Then I adore the Kshamâ*s*rama*n*a De*s*iga*n*in of the Kâ*s*yapa gotra,
who, steady in his conduct, possesses the highest righteousness and
virtue. xi.

Then I prostrate myself before the Kshamâ*s*rama*n*a Sthiragupta of the
Vâtsya gotra, the preserver of the sacred lore, the wise one, the ocean
of wisdom, him of great virtue. xii.

Then I adore the Sthavira prince, Dharma, the virtuous Ga*n*in, who
stands well in knowledge, intuition, good conduct, and penance, and is
rich in virtues <span id="fr_681"></span>[1](#fn_674.md). xiii.

I revere the Kshamâ*s*rama*n*a Devarddhi of the Kâ*s*yapa gotra, who
wears, as it were, the jewel of the right understanding of the Sûtras,
and possesses the virtues of patience, self-restraint, and clemency.
xiv.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_663"></span>[286:1](sbe2290.htm#fr_670.md) Some spell this
name Ma*nd*i*t*aputra; he and Mauryaputra were sons of the same mother,
Vi*g*ayadevî, but different fathers; the former of Dhanadeva, the other
of Maurya. I do not know any legend which connects this Maurya with a
king of the Maurya dynasty, which besides would be impossible from a
chronological point of view.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[287:1](sbe2290.htm#fr_671.md) The sum total of
*S*rama*n*as is therefore 4711, while in § 134 it is stated to have been
14,000.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[287:2](sbe2290.htm#fr_672.md) I only give the
facts. The names of those Sthaviras who continue the line are spaced.
The names are given in their Sanskrit form which in many cases is well
known, in others can easily be made out. In doubtful cases I have put
the Prâkrit form in brackets.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[288:1](sbe2290.htm#fr_673.md) He is left out in
some MSS.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[288:2](sbe2290.htm#fr_674.md) It is not quite
clear what is meant by Ga*n*a, Kula, and *S*âkhâ. Ga*n*a designates the
school which is derived from one teacher; Kula the succession of
teachers in one line; *S*âkhâ the lines which branch off from each
teacher. These terms seem to be disused in modern times, for the four
principal divisions called after Nâgendra, *K*andra, Niv*ri*tti, and
Vidyâdhara are generally called Kulas, but also occasionally Sâkhâs.
They go back to Va*g*ra according to some, to Va*g*rasena according to
others. The modern Ga*kkh*a appears equivalent with the ancient Ga*n*a.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[289:1](sbe2290.htm#fr_675.md) Tîsabhadda,
translated Trida*s*abhadra.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[289:2](sbe2290.htm#fr_676.md) Or Sumanabhadra.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[289:3](sbe2290.htm#fr_677.md) Or Pûr*n*ibhadra.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[290:1](sbe2290.htm#fr_678.md) Suhastin is said to
have converted Samprati, grandson and successor of A*s*oka. The
correctness of this statement is open to doubt; but at any rate Suhastin
must have been one of the most important patriarchs, for under and
immediately after him the spread of *G*ainism must have been uncommonly
vigorous, as is proved by the great number of Kulas and *S*âkhâs at that
time.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[294:1](sbe2290.htm#fr_679.md) A various reading
has *G*e*tth*ila = *G*yesh*th*a.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[294:2](sbe2290.htm#fr_680.md) This list in prose
from 17 down to 33 is wanting in some MSS. I think that *S*â*nd*ilya is
the same as Skandila, who was president of the council of Mathurâ, which
seems to have been the rival of that in Valabhî; see notes to my edition
of the Kalpa Sûtra, p. 117.

It deserves to be noticed that the gotra of Sâ*nd*ilya is not given,
while that of the remaining Sthaviras is specialised. This seems to
prove that his name is a later addition to the list.

After the prose list all MSS. have eight gâthâs, in which the names
16-32, given above, are repeated. Instead of translating these verses,
which contain little more than a string of names, I only note down the
differences from the above list. After 18 is added Dur*g*aya
K*ri*sh*n*a, a Kau*t*ika; Nakshatra is shortened, metri causa, to
Nakkha; the gotra of Saṅghapâlita is Kâ*s*yapa instead of Gautama; after
30 are inserted Hasta of the Kâ*s*yapa gotra and Dharma.

After these gâthâs follow five more, which are wanting in some MSS., and
are not commented upon. The last (14th) gâthâ is <span id="page_295">p.
295</span> found in all MSS. It brings the list down to the president of
the council of Valabhî. (The translation of the gâthâs ix-xiv is given
in full in the text.)

<span id="fn_674"></span>[295:1](sbe2290.htm#fr_681.md) The Sthaviras named
in verses ix-xiii are probably not to be regarded as following each
other in a continuous line, but rather as famous Sthaviras praised here
for some reason or other (pû*g*ârtham). At least the first, *G*ambû,
seems to be the same with *G*ambû, the second of the list, who was also
a Kâ*s*yapa.
