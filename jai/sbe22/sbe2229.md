#### SIXTH LESSON.

Some not instructed (in the true law) make (only a show) of good
conduct; some, though instructed,

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

have no good conduct. Let that not be your case! That is the doctrine of
the clever one. Adopting the (â*k*ârya's) views, imitating his
indifference (for the outer world), making him the guide and adviser (in
all one's matters), sharing his abode, conquering (sinfulness), one sees
the truth; unconquered one should be one's own master, having no
reliance on anything (in the world). He who is great and withdraws his
mind from the outer world, should learn the teaching (of the
Tîrthakaras) through the teaching (of the â*k*ârya); by his own innate
knowledge, or through the instruction of the highest <span
id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_222.md), or having heard it from others. A wise
man should not break the commandment. Examining all (wrong) doctrines
from all sides and in all respects, one should clearly understand (and
reject) them. 'Knowing the delight of this world <span
id="fr_226"></span>[2](#fn_223.md), circumspect and restrained, one should
lead the life of an ascetic.' Desiring liberation <span
id="fr_227"></span>[3](#fn_224.md), a hero should, through the sacred lore,
ever be victorious. Thus I say. (1)

The current (of sin) <span id="fr_228"></span>[4](#fn_225.md) is said to
come from above, from below, and from the sides; these have been
declared to be the currents through which, look, there is sinfulness.

'Examining the whirlpool <span id="fr_229"></span>[5](#fn_226.md), a man,
versed in the sacred lore, should keep off from it.' Leaving the world
to avert the current (of sin), such a great

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

man, free from acts, knows and sees the truth; examining (pleasures) he
does not desire them. (2) Knowing whence we come and whither we go, he
leaves the road to birth and death, rejoicing in the glorious
(liberation). 'All sounds recoil thence, where speculation has no room,'
nor does the mind penetrate there <span id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_227.md).
The saint <span id="fr_231"></span>[2](#fn_228.md) knows well that which is
without support <span id="fr_232"></span>[3](#fn_229). (3.md)

(The liberated) is not long nor small nor round nor triangular nor
quadrangular nor circular; he is not black nor blue nor red nor green
nor white; neither of good nor bad smell; not bitter nor pungent nor
astringent nor sweet; neither rough nor soft; neither heavy nor light;
neither cold nor hot; neither harsh nor smooth; he is without body,
without resurrection, without contact (of matter), he is not feminine
nor masculine nor neuter; he perceives, he knows, but there is no
analogy (whereby to know the nature of the liberated soul); its essence
is without form; there is no condition of the unconditioned. There is no
sound, no colour, no smell, no taste, no touch--nothing of that kind.
Thus I say. (4)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_219"></span>[50:1](sbe2228.htm#fr_222.md) Fool, bâla; the
scholiast explains bâla as *S*âkya or Pâr*s*vastha, an outsider, or a
follower of Pâr*s*va (?).

<span id="fn_220"></span>[50:2](sbe2228.htm#fr_223.md) For the same pain he
has caused to others in this life, he will suffer in the life hereafter.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[50:3](sbe2228.htm#fr_224.md) This means that
knowledge is a modification (pari*n*âma) of the Self, and therefore one
with it, but not as a quality or action of the Self different from it.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[51:1](sbe2229.htm#fr_225.md) I.e. the
Tîrthakaras.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[51:2](sbe2229.htm#fr_226.md) I.e. self-control.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[51:3](sbe2229.htm#fr_227.md) The original has
ni*tth*iya = nish*th*ita.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[51:4](sbe2229.htm#fr_228.md) It is called the
door of âsrava. The three directions mentioned in the text, are the
three divisions of the universe. Objects of desire in each induce men to
sin. The original is a *s*loka, noticed as such by the scholiast.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[51:5](sbe2229.htm#fr_229.md) Of worldly desires
and their objects.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[52:1](sbe2229.htm#fr_230.md) It is impossible to
express the nature of liberation in words, since it cannot be reached
even by the mind.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[52:2](sbe2229.htm#fr_231.md) Oe = o*g*a, he who
is free from love and hate.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[52:3](sbe2229.htm#fr_232.md) I.e. liberation, or
the state of the liberated. Support, patit*th*â*n*a, is the body or
karman.
