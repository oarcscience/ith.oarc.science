#### SECOND LESSON.

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept food, &c., in the
following case: when, on the eighth or paushadha day, on the beginning
of a fortnight, of a month, of two, three, four, five, or six months, or
on the days of the seasons, of the junction of the seasons, of the
intervals of the seasons, many *S*rama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as, guests,
paupers, and beggars are entertained with food, &c., out of one or two
or three or four vessels, pots, baskets, or heaps of food; such-like
food which has been prepared by the giver, &c., (all down to) not tasted
of, is impure and unacceptable. But if it is prepared by another person,
&c. (see first lesson, § 13), one may accept it; for it is pure and
acceptable. (1)

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour may accept food, &c., from unblamed,
uncensured families, to wit, noble families, distinguished families,
royal families, families belonging to the line of Ikshvâku, of Hari,
cowherds' families, Vai*s*ya families, barbers' families, carpenters'
families, *t*akurs' families, weavers' families; for such food, &c., is
pure and acceptable. (2)

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept food, &c., in the
following case: when in assemblies, or during offerings to the manes, or
on a festival of Indra or Skanda or Rudra or Mukunda or demons or
Yakshas or the snakes, or on a festival in honour of a tomb, or a
shrine, or a tree, or a hill, or a cave, or a well, or a tank, or a
pond, or a river, or a lake, or the sea, or a mine--when on such-like
various festivals many *S*rama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as,

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

guests, paupers, and beggars are entertained with food, &c. (all as in §
1, down to) acceptable. (3)

But when he perceives that all have received their due share, and are
enjoying their meal, he should address <span
id="fr_331"></span>[1](#fn_327.md) the householder's wife or sister or
daughter-in-law or nurse or male or female servant or slave and say: 'O
long-lived one! (or, O sister!) will you give me something to eat?'
After these words of the mendicant, the other may bring forth food, &c.,
and give it him. Such food, &c., whether he beg for it or the other give
it, he may accept; for it is pure and acceptable. (4)

When a monk or a nun knows that at a distance of more than half a
yo*g*ana a festive entertainment <span id="fr_332"></span>[2](#fn_328.md)
is going on, they should not resolve to go there for the sake of the
festive entertainment. (5)

When a monk hears that the entertainment is given in an eastern or
western or southern or northern place, he should go respectively to the
west or east or north or south, being quite indifferent (about the
feast); wherever there is a festive entertainment, in a village or
scot-free town, &c. (see I, 7, 6, § 4), he should not go there for the
sake of the festive entertainment.

The Kevalin assigns as the reason for this precept, that if the monk
eats food, &c., which has been given him on such an occasion, he will
incur the sin of one

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

who uses what <span id="fr_333"></span>[1](#fn_329.md) has been prepared
for him, or is mixed up with living beings, or has been bought or stolen
or taken, though it was not to be taken, nor was it given, but taken by
force. (6)

A layman <span id="fr_334"></span>[2](#fn_330.md) might, for the sake of a
mendicant, make small doors large, or large ones small; put beds <span
id="fr_335"></span>[3](#fn_331.md) from a level position into a sloping
one, or from a sloping position into a level one; place the beds <span
id="fr_336"></span>[3](#fn_331.md) out of the draught or in the draught;
cutting and clipping the grass outside or within the upâ*s*raya, spread
a couch for him, (thinking that) this mendicant is without means for a
bed <span id="fr_337"></span>[3](#fn_331.md). Therefore should a
well-controlled Nirgrantha not resolve to go to any festival which is
preceded or followed by a feast.

This certainly is the whole duty, &c. (see end of lesson I).

Thus I say. (7)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_327"></span>[93:1](sbe2248.htm#fr_331.md) Puvvâm eva
âloe*gg*â, he should first look at him or her (and then say).

<span id="fn_328"></span>[93:2](sbe2248.htm#fr_332.md) Sa*m*kha*d*i,
somewhere explained odanapâka, cooking of rice; in the commentary the
following etymology is given: sa*m*kha*nd*yante virâdhyante prâ*n*ino
yatra sâ sa*m*kha*d*i. But the Guzerati commentator explains it:
*g*ihâ*m* gha*n*â *g*a*n* nimitti âhâra kelvivâ bha*n*â.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[94:1](sbe2248.htm#fr_333.md) This stands for
âhâkammiya and uddesiya, pure and impure food prepared for a mendicant.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[94:2](sbe2248.htm#fr_334.md) Asa*mg*ae, the
uncontrolled one; it denotes a layman or a householder.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[94:3](sbe2248.htm#fr_337.md) Se*gg*â = *s*ayyâ,
bed; but the scholiast explains it by vasati, dwelling, lodging.
