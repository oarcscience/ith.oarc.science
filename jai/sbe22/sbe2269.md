#### SECOND LESSON.

A monk or a nun, entering the abode of a householder for the sake of
alms, should after examining their alms-bowl, taking out any living
beings, and wiping off the dust, circumspectly enter or leave the
householder's abode.

The Kevalin says: This is the reason: Living beings, seeds or dust might
fall into his bowl. Hence it has been said to the mendicant, &c., that
he should after examining his alms-bowl, taking out any living beings,
circumspectly enter or leave the householder's abode. (1)

On such an occasion the householder might perhaps, going in the house,
fill the alms-bowl with cold water and, returning, offer it him; (the
mendicant) should not accept such an alms-bowl <span

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

the householder's hand or his vessel; for it is impure and unacceptable.
(2)

Perhaps he has, inadvertently, accepted it; then he should empty it
again in (the householder's) water-pot; or (on his objecting to it) he
should put down the bowl and the water somewhere, or empty it in some
wet place. (3)

A monk or a nun should not wipe or rub a wet or moist alms-bowl. But
when they perceive that on their alms-bowl the water has dried up and
the moisture is gone, then they may circumspectly wipe or rub it. (4)

A monk or a nun wanting to enter the abode of a householder, should
enter or leave it, for the sake of alms, with their bowl; also on going
to the out-of-door place for religious practices or study; or on
wandering from village to village.

If a strong and widely spread rain pours down, they should take the same
care of their alms-bowl as is prescribed for clothes (in the preceding
Lecture, Lesson 2, § 1).

This is the whole duty, &c.

Thus I say. (5)

End of the Sixth Lecture, called Begging for a Bowl.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_437"></span>[169:1](sbe2269.htm#fr_443.md) Though the
alms-bowl is expressly mentioned, it must stand here for water, as the
commentators interpret the passage.
