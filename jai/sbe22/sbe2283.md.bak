#### Life of Mahâvîra, Lecture 3

In that night in which the embryo of the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra was
removed from the womb of the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ of the
*G*âlandharâya*n*a gotra to that of the Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ of the

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vâsish*th*a gotra,
the former was on her couch taking fits of sleep in a state between
sleeping and waking; and seeing that these fourteen illustrious,
beautiful, lucky, blest, auspicious, fortunate, great dreams were taken
from her by the Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ, she awoke. (31)

In that night in which the embryo of the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra was
removed from the womb of the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ of the
*G*âlandharâya*n*a gotra to that of the Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ of the
Vâsish*th*a gotra, the latter was in her dwelling-place, of which the
interior was ornamented with pictures, and the outside whitewashed,
furbished and cleansed, the brilliant surface of the ceiling was
painted, the darkness was dispelled by jewels and precious stones, the
floor was perfectly level and adorned with auspicious figures; which,
moreover, was furnished with offerings of heaps of delicious, fragrant,
strewn flowers of all five colours, was highly delightful through
curling, scented fumes of black aloe, the finest Kundurukka and
Turushka <span id="fr_549"></span>[1](#fn_542.md), and burning
frankincense; was exquisitely scented with fine perfumes, and turned as
it were into a smelling-bottle; on a couch with a mattress of a man's
length, with pillows at head and foot, raised on both sides and hollow
in the middle, soft as if one walked on the sand of the banks of the
Ganges, covered with the cloth of a robe of ornamented linen, containing
a well-worked towel, and hung with red mosquito curtains, delightful,
soft to the touch like fur, wadding, Pûra <span
id="fr_550"></span>[2](#fn_543.md), butter, or cotton, with all the
comforts of

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

a bed, such as fragrant, excellent flowers and sandal-powder--(in such a
room and on such a bed Tri*s*alâ was) taking fits of sleep between
sleeping and waking, and having seen the following fourteen, &c. (see §
3), dreams, viz. an elephant, &c. (see § 4), she awoke. (32)

1\. Then Tri*s*alâ saw in her first dream a fine, enormous elephant,
possessing all lucky marks, with strong thighs and four mighty tusks;
who was whiter than an empty great cloud, or a heap of pearls, or the
ocean of milk, or the moon-beams, or spray of water, or the silver
mountain (Vaitâ*dh*ya); whose temples were perfumed with fragrant
musk-fluid, which attracted the bees; equalling in dimension the best
elephant of the king of the gods (Airâvata); uttering a fine deep sound
like the thunder of a big and large rain-cloud. (33)

2\. Then she saw a tame, lucky bull, of a whiter hue than that of the
mass of petals of the white lotus, illumining all around by the
diffusion of a glory of light; (a bull) whose lovely, resplendent,
beautiful hump was delightful through the collection of its charms,
whose glossy skin (was covered with) thin, fine, soft hairs; whose body
was firm, well made, muscular, compact, lovely, well proportioned, and
beautiful; whose horns were large, round, excellently beautiful, greased
at their tops, and pointed; whose teeth were all equal, shining, and
pure. He foreboded innumerable good qualities. (34)

3\. Then she saw a handsome, handsomely shaped, playful lion, jumping
from the sky towards her face; a delightful and beautiful lion whiter
than a heap of pearls, &c. (see § 33), who had strong and lovely
fore-arms, and a mouth adorned with round, large,

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

and well-set teeth; whose lovely lips, splendent through their
proportions, and soft like a noble lotus, looked as if they were
artificially ornamented; whose palate <span
id="fr_551"></span>[1](#fn_544.md) was soft and tender like the petals of
the red lotus, and the top of whose tongue was protruding; whose eyes
were like pure lightning, and revolved like red-hot excellent gold just
poured out from the crucible; (a lion) with broad and large thighs, and
with full and excellent shoulders, who was adorned with a mane of soft,
white, thin, long hair of the finest quality; whose erect, well-shaped,
and well-grown tail was flapping; the tops of whose nails were deeply
set and sharp; whose beautiful tongue came out of his mouth like a shoot
of beauty. (35)

4\. Then she, with the face of the full moon, saw the goddess of famous
beauty, *S*rî, on the top of Mount Himavat, reposing on a lotus in the
lotus lake, anointed with the water from the strong and large trunks of
the guardian elephants. She sat on a lofty throne. Her firmly placed
feet resembled golden tortoises, and her dyed, fleshy, convex, thin,
red, smooth nails were set in swelling muscles <span
id="fr_552"></span>[2](#fn_545.md). Her hands and feet were like the leaves
of the lotus, and her fingers and toes soft and excellent; her round and
well-formed legs were adorned with the Kuruvindâvarta <span
id="fr_553"></span>[3](#fn_546.md), and her knees with dimples. Her fleshy
thighs resembled the proboscis of an excellent elephant, and her lovely
broad hips were encircled by a golden zone. Her large and beautiful
belly was

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

adorned by a circular navel, and contained a lovely row of hairs (black
as) collyrium, bees, or clouds, straight, even, continuous, thin,
admirable, handsome, soft, and downy. Her waist, which contained the
three folds, could be encompassed with one hand. On all parts of her
body shone ornaments and trinkets, composed of many jewels and precious
stones, yellow and red gold. The pure cup-like pair of her breasts
sparkled, encircled by a garland of Kunda flowers, in which glittered a
string of pearls. She wore strings of pearls made by diligent and clever
artists, shining with wonderful strings, a necklace of jewels with a
string of Dînârâs <span id="fr_554"></span>[1](#fn_547.md), and a trembling
pair of earrings, touching her shoulders, diffused a brilliancy; but the
united beauties and charms of these ornaments were only subservient to
the loveliness of her face <span id="fr_555"></span>[2](#fn_548.md). Her
lovely eyes were large and pure like the water lily. She sprinkled about
the sap from two lotus flowers which she held in her splendid hands, and
gracefully fanned herself. Her glossy, black, thick, smooth hair hung
down in a braid. (36)

5\. Then she saw, coming down from the firmament, a garland charmingly
interwoven with fresh Mandâra flowers. It spread the delicious smell of
*K*ampaka <span id="fr_556"></span>[3](#fn_549.md), A*s*oka <span
id="fr_557"></span>[4](#fn_550.md), Nâga <span
id="fr_558"></span>[5](#fn_551.md) Punnâga <span
id="fr_559"></span>[6](#fn_552.md), Priyaṅgu <span
id="fr_560"></span>[7](#fn_553.md),

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *S*irîsha <span
id="fr_561"></span>[1](#fn_554.md), Mudgara <span
id="fr_562"></span>[2](#fn_555.md), Mallikâ <span
id="fr_563"></span>[3](#fn_556.md), *G*âti <span
id="fr_564"></span>[4](#fn_557.md), Yûthika <span
id="fr_565"></span>[5](#fn_558.md), Aṅkolla <span
id="fr_566"></span>[6](#fn_559.md), Kora*nt*akapatra <span
id="fr_567"></span>[7](#fn_560.md), Damanaka <span
id="fr_568"></span>[8](#fn_561.md), Navamâlikâ <span
id="fr_569"></span>[9](#fn_562.md), Bakula <span
id="fr_570"></span>[10](#fn_563.md), Tilaka <span
id="fr_571"></span>[11](#fn_564.md), Vâsantika <span
id="fr_572"></span>[12](#fn_565.md), Nuphar, Nymphaea, Pâ*t*ala. <span
id="fr_573"></span>[13](#fn_566.md), Kunda <span
id="fr_574"></span>[14](#fn_567.md), Atimukta <span
id="fr_575"></span>[15](#fn_568.md), and Mango; and perfumed the ten
divisions of the universe with its incomparably delightful fragrance. It
was white through wreaths of fragrant flowers of all seasons, and
brilliant through splendid, beautiful embellishments of many colours.
Towards it came humming swarms of different kinds of bees <span
id="fr_576"></span>[16](#fn_569.md), and filled with their sweet noise the
whole neighbourhood. (37)

6\. And the moon: white as cow-milk, foam, spray of water, or a silver
cup, glorious, delighting heart and eyes, full, dispelling the compact
darkness of the thickest wilderness, whose crescent shines at the end of
the two halves of the month, opening the blossoms of the groups of
Nymphaeas, adorning the night, resembling the surface of a well-polished
mirror. She was of a white hue, like a flamingo, the stars'
head-ornament, the quiver of Cupid's arrows, raising the waters of the
ocean, burning as it were disconsolate

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

people when absent from their sweethearts, the large, glorious,
wandering headmark of the celestial sphere--beloved in heart and soul by
Rohi*n*î <span id="fr_577"></span>[1](#fn_570.md). Such was the glorious,
beautiful, resplendent full moon which the queen saw. (38)

7\. Then she saw the large sun, the dispeller of the mass of darkness,
him of radiant form, red like the A*s*oka, the open Ki*m*suka, the bill
of a parrot, or the Gu*ñg*ârdha <span id="fr_578"></span>[2](#fn_571.md),
the adorner of the lotus groups, the marker of the starry host, the lamp
of the firmament, throttling as it were the mass of cold, the
illustrious leader of the troop of planets, the destroyer of night, who
only at his rising and setting may be well viewed, but (at all other
times) is difficult to be regarded, who disperses evil-doers that stroll
about at night, who stops the influence of cold, who always circles
round Mount Meru, whose thousand rays obscure the lustre of other
lights <span id="fr_579"></span>[3](#fn_572). (39.md)

8\. Then she saw an extremely beautiful and very large flag, a sight for
all people, of a form attractive to the beholders. It was fastened to a
golden staff with a tuft of many soft and waving peacock's feathers of
blue, red, yellow, and white colours, and seemed as if it would pierce
the brilliant, celestial sphere, with the brilliant lion on its top, who
was white like crystal, pearlmother, Aṅka-stone, Kunda-flowers, spray of
water, or a silver cup. (40)

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

9\. Then she saw a full vase of costly metal <span
id="fr_580"></span>[1](#fn_573.md), splendent with fine gold, filled with
pure water, excellent, of brilliant beauty, and shining with a bouquet
of water lilies. It united many excellencies and all-auspicious marks,
and stood on a lotus-(shaped foot), shining with excellent jewels <span
id="fr_581"></span>[2](#fn_574.md). It delighted the eyes, glittered and
illumined all about; it was the abode of happy Fortune, free from all
faults, fine, splendid, exquisitely beautiful, entwined with a wreath of
fragrant flowers of all seasons. (41)

10\. Then she saw a lake, called Lotus Lake, adorned with water lilies.
Its yellow water was perfumed by lotuses opening in the rays of the
morning sun; it abounded with swarms of aquatic animals, and fed fishes.
It was large, and seemed to burn through the wide-spreading, glorious
beauty of all kinds of lotuses <span id="fr_582"></span>[3](#fn_575.md).
Its shape and beauty were pleasing. The lotuses in it were licked by
whole swarms of gay bees and mad drones. Pairs of swans, cranes,
*K*akravâkas, ducks, Indian cranes, and many other lusty birds resorted
to its waters, and on the leaves of its lotuses sparkled water-drops
like pearls <span id="fr_583"></span>[4](#fn_576.md). It was a sight,
pleasing to the heart and the eye. (42)

11\. Then she whose face was splendid like the

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

moon in autumn, saw the milk-ocean, equalling in beauty the breast of
Lakshmî, which is white like the mass of moon-beams. Its waters
increased in all four directions, and raged with ever-changing and
moving, excessively high waves. It presented a splendid and pleasant
spectacle as it rushed to and from the shore with its wind-raised,
changeable, and moving billows, its tossing waves, and its rolling,
splendid, transparent breakers. From it issued camphor-white foam under
the lashing (tails) of great porpoises, fishes, whales, and other
monsters of the deep <span id="fr_584"></span>[1](#fn_577.md). Its agitated
waters were in great uproar, occasioned by the vortex Gaṅgâvarta, which
the vehemence and force of the great rivers produced; they rose, rushed
onwards and backwards, and eddied. (43)

12\. Then she saw a celestial abode excelling among the best of its
kind, like the lotus (among flowers). It shone like the morning sun's
disk, and was of a dazzling beauty. Its thousand and eight excellent
columns (inlaid with) the best gold and heaps of jewels diffused a
brilliant light like a heavenly lamp, and the pearls fastened to its
curtains glittered. It was hung with brilliant divine garlands, and
decorated with pictures of wolves, bulls, horses, men, dolphins, birds,
snakes, Kinnaras, deer, *S*arabhas, Yaks, Sa*m*saktas <span
id="fr_585"></span>[2](#fn_578.md), elephants, shrubs, and plants. There
the Gandharvas performed their concerts, and the din of the drums of the
gods,

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

imitating the sound of big and large rain-clouds, penetrated the whole
inhabited world. It was highly delightful through curling, scented fumes
of black aloe, the finest Kundurukka and Turushka, burning frankincense
and other perfumes. It (shed) continuous light, was white, of excellent
lustre, delighting the best of gods, and affording joy and pleasure.
(44)

13\. Then she saw an enormous heap of jewels containing Pulaka, Va*g*ra,
Indranîla, Sasyaka, Karketana, Lohitâksha, Marakata, Prabâla,
Saugandhika, Spha*t*ika, Ha*m*sagarbha, A*ñg*ana, and *K*andrakânta. Its
base was on the level of the earth, and it illumined with its jewels
even the sphere of the sky. It was high and resembled Mount Meru. (45)

14\. And a fire. She saw a fire in vehement motion, fed with
much-shining and honey-coloured ghee, smokeless, crackling, and
extremely beautiful with its burning flames. The mass of its flames,
which rose one above the other, seemed to interpenetrate each other, and
the blaze of its flames appeared to bake the firmament in some places.
(46)

After having seen these fine, beautiful, lovely, handsome dreams, the
lotus-eyed queen awoke on her bed while the hair of her body bristled
for joy.

Every mother of a Tîrthakara sees these fourteen dreams in that night in
which the famous Arhat enters her womb. (46 b)

part of the Kalpa Sûtra.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[233:2](sbe2283.htm#fr_555.md) I cannot accurately
construe this passage; my translation is therefore rather free, but, I
believe, comes near the meaning of the original.

or Dalbergia Ougeinense.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[234:16](sbe2283.htm#fr_576.md) Sha*t*pada,
madhukarî, bhramara. The sha*t*pada are literally six-footed bees, as
Stevenson correctly translated, but he strangely reckons them among the
preternatural animals, like the four-tusked elephants, dear to the
imagination of the *G*ains!

<span id="fn_570"></span>[235:1](sbe2283.htm#fr_577.md) The commentators
understand this passage (Rohi*n*îma*n*ahiyayavallabha*m*) differently by
explaining hiyaya by hitada, the lover of Rohi*n*î who did her mind
good.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[235:2](sbe2283.htm#fr_578.md) According to
Stevenson: the red side of the retti seed.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[235:3](sbe2283.htm#fr_579.md) Or if we adopt a
various reading, mentioned in the commentary, paya*d*iya, we must
translate: whose luminous glory was set forth by his thousand rays.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[236:1](sbe2283.htm#fr_580.md) The original has
rayaya, silver, but as the commentary remarks, this would be in conflict
with the epithet which we have put next, but which, in the original, is
separated from it by many lines. Unless the author has blundered, which
from his vague style seems far from impossible, the word must here have
a more indefinite meaning than it usually has.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[236:2](sbe2283.htm#fr_581.md) This passage may
also be translated: standing on a lotus filled with pollen, of excellent
workmanship.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[236:3](sbe2283.htm#fr_582.md) Specialised in the
text as kamula, kuvalaya, utpala, tâmarasa, and pu*nd*arîka.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[236:4](sbe2283.htm#fr_583.md) According to the
commentary; the textus receptus is, many water-drops.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[237:1](sbe2283.htm#fr_584.md) The original has
timiṅgila-niruddha-tilitilika.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[237:2](sbe2283.htm#fr_585.md) Sa*m*sakta, which I
do not find mentioned elsewhere, is explained, 'a kind of beast of
prey;' I think that sa*m*sakta may be an adjective specifying the
following word, and mean 'fighting' elephants.
