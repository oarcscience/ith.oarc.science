#### THIRD LESSON <span id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_103.md).

(Thus I say): He who acts rightly, who does pious work, who practises no
deceit, is called houseless. (1) One should, conquering the world,
persevere in that (vigour of) faith which one had on the entrance in the
order; the heroes (of faith), humbly bent, (should retain their belief
in) the illustrious road (to final liberation) and in the world (of
water-bodies); having rightly comprehended them through the instruction
(of Mahâvîra), (they should retain) that which causes no danger (i.e.
self-control). Thus I say. (2) A man should not (himself) deny the world
of (water-bodies), nor should he deny the self. He who denies the world
(of water-bodies), denies the self; and he who denies the self, denies
the world of (water-bodies). (3)

See! there are men who control themselves;

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

others pretend only to be houseless; for one destroys this (water-body)
by bad, injurious doings, and many other beings, besides, which he hurts
by means of water, through his doing acts relating to water. (4) About
this the Revered One has taught the truth: for the sake of the
splendour, honour, and glory of this life, for the sake of birth, death,
and final liberation, for the removal of pain, man acts sinfully towards
water, or causes others to act so, or allows others to act so. (5) This
deprives him of happiness and perfect wisdom. About this he is informed
when he has understood and heard from the Revered One, or from the
monks, the faith to be coveted. There are some who, of a truth, know
this (i.e. injuring) to be the bondage, the delusion, the death, the
hell. For this a man is longing when he destroys this (water-body) by
bad and injurious doings, and many other beings, besides, which he hurts
by means of water, through his doing acts relating to water. Thus I say.
(6)

There are beings living in water, many lives; of a truth, to the monks
water has been declared to be living matter. See! considering the
injuries (done to water-bodies), those acts (which are injuries, but
must be done before the use of water, e*g*. straining) have been
distinctly declared. Moreover he (who uses water which is not strained)
takes away what has not been given (i.e. the bodies of water-lives). (A
Bauddha will object): 'We have permission, we have permission to drink
it, or (to take it) for toilet purposes.' Thus they destroy by various
injuries (the water-bodies). But in this their doctrine is of no
authority.

He who injures these (water-bodies) does not

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

comprehend and renounce the sinful acts; he who does not injure these,
comprehends and renounces the sinful acts. (7) Knowing them, a wise man
should not act sinfully towards water, nor cause others to act so, nor
allow others to act so. He who knows these causes of sin relating to
water, is called a reward-knowing sage. Thus I say. (8)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_103"></span>[5:1](sbe2205.htm#fr_104.md) The water-lives which
are treated of in this lesson are, as is the case with all elementary
lives, divided into three classes: the sentient, the senseless, and the
mixed. Only that water which is the abode of senseless water-lives may
be used. Therefore water is to be strained before use, because the
senseless lives only are believed to remain in water after that process.
