<p>'Frequently (I have been born) in a high family, frequently in a low one; I am not mean, nor noble, nor do I desire (social preferment).' Thus reflecting, who would brag about his family or about his glory, or for what should he long? (1)</p>  
<p>Therefore a wise man should neither be glad nor angry (about his lot): thou shouldst know and consider the happiness of living creatures. Carefully conducting himself, he should mind this: blindness, deafness, dumbness, one-eyedness,</p>  
<p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></A></p>  
<p>hunchbackedness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, blackness, variety of colour (he will always experience); because of his carelessness he is born in many births, he experiences various feelings. (2)</p>  
<p>Not enlightened (about the cause of these ills) he is afflicted (by them), always turns round (in the whirl of) birth and death. Life is dear to many who own fields and houses. Having acquired dyed and coloured (clothes), jewels, earrings, gold, and women, they become attached to these things. And a fool who longs for life, and worldly-minded&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, laments that (for these worldly goods) penance, self-restraint, and control do not avail, will ignorantly come to grief. (3)</p>  
<p>Those who are of a steady conduct do not desire this (wealth). Knowing birth and death, one should firmly walk the path (i.e. right conduct), (and not wait for old age to commence a religious life),</p>  
<p>For there is nothing inaccessible for death. All beings are fond of life&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, like pleasure, hate pain, shun destruction, like life, long to live. To all life is dear&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. (4)</p>  
<p>Having acquired it (i.e. wealth), employing bipeds and quadrupeds, gathering riches in the three ways&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>,</p>  
<p>

<p>whatever his portion will be, small or great, he will desire to enjoy it. Then at one time, his manifold savings are a large treasure. Then at another time, his heirs divide it, or those who are without a living steal it, or the king takes it away, or it is ruined in some way or other, or it is consumed by the conflagration of the house. Thus a fool doing cruel deeds which benefit another, will ignorantly come thereby to grief. (5)</p>  
<p>This certainly has been declared by the sage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. They do not cross the flood&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, nor can they cross it; they do not go to the next shore, nor can they go to it; they do not go to the opposite shore, nor can they go to it.</p>  
<p>And though hearing the doctrine, he does not stand in the right place; but the clever one who adopts the true (faith), stands in the right place (i.e. control)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>He who sees by himself, needs no instruction. But the miserable, afflicted fool who delights in pleasures, and whose miseries do not cease, is turned round in the whirl of pains. Thus I say. (6)</p>
