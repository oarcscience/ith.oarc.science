### SEVENTH LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### REGULATION OF POSSESSION <span id="fr_444"></span>[1](#fn_438).

#### FIRST LESSON.

'I shall become a *S*rama*n*a who owns no house, no property, no sons,
no cattle, who eats what others give him; I shall commit no sinful
action; Master, I renounce to accept anything that has not been given.'
Having taken such vows, (a mendicant) should not, on entering a village
or scot-free town, &c., take himself, or induce others to take, or allow
others to take, what has not been given. A mendicant should not take or
appropriate any property, viz. an umbrella <span
id="fr_445"></span>[2](#fn_439) or vessel or stick, &c. (see II, 2, 3, §
2), of those monks together with whom he stays, without getting their
permission, and without having inspected and wiped (the object in
question); but having got their permission, and having inspected and
wiped (the object in question), he may take or appropriate it <span
id="fr_446"></span>[3](#fn_440). (1)

He may beg for a domicile in a traveller's hall, &c.

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (see II, 1, 8, §
2), having reflected (on its fitness for a stay); he should ask
permission to take possession of it from him who is the landlord or the
steward of that place: 'Indeed, O long-lived one! for the time, and in
the space which you concede us, we shall dwell here. We shall take
possession of the place for as long a time as the place belongs to you;
and of as much of it as belongs to you; for as many fellow-ascetics (as
shall stand in need of it); afterwards we shall take to wandering <span
id="fr_447"></span>[1](#fn_441).' (2)

Having got possession of some place, a mendicant should invite to that
food, &c., which he himself has collected, any fellow-ascetics arriving
there who follow the same rules and are zealous brethren; but he should
not invite them to anything of which he has taken possession for the
sake of somebody else. (3)

Having got possession of some place (in a traveller's hall, &c.), a
mendicant should offer a footstool or bench or bed or couch, which he
himself has begged, to any fellow-ascetics arriving there who follow
other rules than he, yet are zealous brethren; but he should not offer
them anything of which he has taken possession for the sake of somebody
else. (4)

Having got possession of some place in a traveller's hall, &c., a
mendicant might ask from a householder or his sons the loan of a needle
or a Pippalaka <span id="fr_448"></span>[2](#fn_442) or an ear-picker or
a nail-parer, he should not give or lend it to somebody else; but

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

having done that for which he wanted one of the above articles, he
should go with that article there (where the householder, &c., is), and
stretching out his hands or laying the article on the ground, he should,
after consideration, say: 'Here it is! here it is!' But he should not
with his own hand put it in the hand of the householder. (5)

A monk or a nun should not take possession of anything <span
id="fr_449"></span>[1](sbe2271.htm#fn_443) on the bare ground, on wet
ground, where there are eggs, &c.; nor on pillars or such an
above-ground place (II, 2, 1, § 7); nor on a wall, &c.; nor on the trunk
of a tree, &c.; nor where the householder or fire or water, or women or
children or cattle are, and where it is not fit for a wise man to enter
or to leave, &c., nor to meditate on the law; nor where they have to
pass through the householder's abode or to which there is no road, and
where it is not fit, &c.; nor where the householder or his wife, &c.,
bully or scold each other, &c. (see II, 2, 1, § 9, and 3, § 7); nor
where they rub or anoint each other's body with oil or ghee or butter or
grease; nor where they take a bath, &c.; nor where they go about naked,
&c. (all as in II, 2, 3, §§ 7-12).

This is the whole duty, &c.

Thus I say. (6-12)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_438"></span>[171:1](sbe2270.htm#fr_444) Oggahapa*d*imâ.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[171:2](sbe2270.htm#fr_445) The commentator
(*S*îlâṅka) states that the monks in Kuṅka*n*ade*s*a, &c., are allowed
to carry umbrellas, because of the heavy rains in that country.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[171:3](sbe2270.htm#fr_446) Ogi*n*he*gg*â vâ
paggi*n*he*gg*â vâ. The commentators explain these words 'to take for
once' (sak*ri*t) and 'to take repeatedly' (aneka*s*as). Later on the
Guzerati commentator explains oggi*n*he*gg*â by mage, he should ask.'

<span id="fn_441"></span>[172:1](sbe2270.htm#fr_447) Compare the
corresponding precept in II, 2, 3, § 3.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[172:2](sbe2270.htm#fr_448) The Guzerati
commentator only says that pippalaka is some utensil. The older
commentators do not explain this passage.
