### SEVENTH LESSON.

To a naked <span id="fr_287"></span>[1](#fn_283.md) monk the thought
occurs: I can bear the pricking of grass, the influence of cold and
heat, the stinging of flies and mosquitos; these and other various
painful feelings I can sustain, but I cannot leave off the covering of
the privities. Then he may cover his privities with a piece of
cloth <span id="fr_288"></span>[2](#fn_284.md).

A naked monk who perseveres in this conduct, sustains repeatedly these
and other various painful feelings: the grass pricks him, heat and cold
attack him, flies and mosquitos sting him. A naked monk (should be)
aspiring to freedom from bonds. Penance suits him. Knowing what the
Revered One has declared, one should thoroughly and in all respects
conform to it. (1)

A monk who has come to any of the following resolutions,--having
collected food, &c., I shall give of it to other monks, and I shall eat
(what they have) brought; (or) having collected food, &c., I shall give
of it to other monks, but I shall not eat

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (what they have)
brought; (or) having collected food, &c., I shall not give of it to
other monks, but I shall eat (what they have) brought; (or) having
collected food, &c., I shall not give of it to other monks, nor eat
(what they have) brought; (2) (or) I shall assist a fellow-ascetic with
the remnants of my dinner, which is acceptable <span
id="fr_289"></span>[1](sbe2242.htm#fn_285.md) and remained in the same
state in which it was received <span
id="fr_290"></span>[2](sbe2242.htm#fn_286.md), and I shall accept the
assistance of fellow-ascetics as regards the remnants of their dinner,
which is acceptable and remained in the same state in which it was
received;--(that monk should keep these vows even if he should run the
risk of his life) (3)--aspiring to freedom from bonds. Penance suits
him. Knowing what the Revered One has declared, one should thoroughly
conform to it. (4)

(The last two paragraphs of the last lesson are to be reproduced here.)

Thus I say. (5)
