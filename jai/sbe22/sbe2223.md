Intangible Textual Heritage

#### FOURTH LESSON.

One should mortify (one's flesh) in a low, high, and highest degree,
quitting one's former connections, and entering tranquillity. Therefore
a hero is careful, a person of pith <span
id="fr_197"></span>[2](#fn_194), guarded, endowed (with knowledge, &c.),
and always restrained. Difficult to go is the road of the heroes, who go
whence there is no return (final liberation). Subdue blood and flesh.
(1)

That man is called a worthy one, a hero, one to be followed, who living
in chastity \[guarding his eyes\] shakes off the aggregate <span
id="fr_198"></span>[3](#fn_195).

He who desires the current of karman, is a fool who has not cut off the
fetters of, nor conquered the connection with, (the world.) For such as
dwell in darkness, and are without knowledge, there is no success in
faith. Thus I say. (2)

'Whence should he have it <span id="fr_199"></span>[4](#fn_196), who
does not get it

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

early, late, or in the middle of life?' But the discerning one is
awakened, and ceases to act. See that it is good to be so! Cutting off
that 'whence bondage, cruel death, and dreadful pain,' 'and the (desire
for) external (objects) flow, he who among mortals knows freedom from
acts,' 'seeing that acts will bear fruit, the knower of the sacred lore,
parts from (karman).' (3)

There are those who have established themselves in the truth, who (were,
are, or will be) heroes, endowed (with knowledge), always exerting
themselves, full of equanimity <span id="fr_200"></span>[1](#fn_197),
valuing the world (as it deserves) in the east, west, south, north. We
shall tell the knowledge of them who (were, &c.) heroes, endowed (with
knowledge), always exerting themselves, full of equanimity, valuing the
world (as it deserves).

Is there any worldly weakness in the Seer? There exists none, there is
none. Thus I say. (4)

End of the Fourth Lecture, called Righteousness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_194"></span>[40:2](sbe2223.htm#fr_197) Sârae. The
commentators translate it with svârata = su + â (â *g*îvanamaryâdâyâ) +
rata (sa*m*yamânush*th*âne), for ever delighting in the exercise of
control. I think the Sanskrit prototype of sârae is sâraka.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[40:3](sbe2223.htm#fr_198) These words seem to
have formed a *s*loka, which could easily be restored if we read: purise
davie vîre âyâ*n*i*gg*e viyâhie \| vâsittâ ba*m*bha*k*era*m*si *g*e
dhu*n*âi samussaya*m* \|\| The aggregate is either that of the
constituent parts of the body, i, e. the body itself, or that of karman,
i.e. the sum of karman.
