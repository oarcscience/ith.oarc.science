#### SECOND LESSON.

Look, Sir, at birth and old age here,  
Examine and know the happiness of the living,  
Thence the most learned, knowing (what is called) the highest good,  
He who has right intuition, commits no sin. (1)

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Undo the bond with
mortals here;  
He who lives by sins, is subject to both <span
id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_164.md),  
Desirous of pleasures they heap up karman,  
Influenced by it they are born again. (2)  
Killing (animals) he thinks good sport, and derives mirth from it:  
Away with that fool's company, he increases his own unrighteousness.
(3)  
Thence the most learned, knowing (what is called) the highest good,  
Aware of the punishment, commits no sin;  
Wisely avoid the top and the root <span
id="fr_166"></span>[2](#fn_165.md)!  
Cutting them off, he knows himself free from karman. (4)

That man will be liberated from death; he is a sage who sees the
danger <span id="fr_167"></span>[3](#fn_166.md), knowing the highest good
in this world, leading a circumspect life, calm, guarded, endowed (with
knowledge, &c.), always restrained, longing for death, he should lead a
religious life. Manifold, indeed, appear sinful actions; therefore prove
constant to truth! Delighting in it <span
id="fr_168"></span>[4](#fn_167), a wise man destroys all karman. (1.md)

Many, indeed, are the plans of this man (of the world); he will satisfy
his desires; he (thereby causes) the slaughter of others, the pain of
others, the punishment of others, the slaughter, the blame,

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

the punishment of a whole province. Doing such things, some have exerted
themselves <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_168). (2.md)

Therefore the second (i.e. the wrong creed) is not adhered to. The
knowing one seeing the vanity (of the world) \[knowing the rise and fall
of the souls <span id="fr_170"></span>[2](#fn_169.md)\], the Brahman
follows the unrivalled (control of the *G*ainas). He should not kill,
nor cause others to kill, nor consent to the killing of others. 'Avoid
gaiety, not delighting in creatures (i.e. women), having the highest
intuition,' keeping off from sinful acts. (3)

And the hero should conquer wrath and pride,  
Look at the great hell (as the place) for greed.  
Therefore the hero abstaining from killing,  
Should destroy sorrow, going the road of easiness <span
id="fr_171"></span>[3](#fn_170.md).

Here now the hero, knowing the bondage,  
Knowing sorrow, should restrain himself.  
Having risen to birth among men,  
He should not take the life of living beings.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_156"></span>[29:1](sbe2216.htm#fr_157.md) A trish*t*ubh
unnoticed by the commentators.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[29:2](sbe2216.htm#fr_158.md) Kheyanna =
kheda*gñ*a nipu*n*a. I think the Sanskrit would rather be kshetra*gñ*a.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[29:3](sbe2216.htm#fr_159.md) I.e. control.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[29:4](sbe2216.htm#fr_160.md) As man, god,
hell-being, young, old, &c.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[29:5](sbe2216.htm#fr_161.md) See [p.
28](sbe2216.htm#page_28), note [4](sbe2216.htm#fn_155.md).

<span id="fn_161"></span>[29:6](sbe2216.htm#fr_162.md) Literally, the left
side (savyam); control is intended.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[29:7](sbe2216.htm#fr_163.md) I.e. he is not
touched by love and hate, which cause death.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[29:8](sbe2216.htm#fr_164) See I, 2, 6 (2.md).

<span id="fn_164"></span>[30:1](sbe2217.htm#fr_165.md) Literally, sees
both, i.e. experiences bodily and mental (agonies), those of this world
and of the next.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[30:2](sbe2217.htm#fr_166.md) The root means
delusion, the top the rest of the sins.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[30:3](sbe2217.htm#fr_167.md) Arising from
worldliness. The same words occur in 2, 6, § 2; but bhae (bhaya) stands
here instead of pahe, road. Bhae occurs also in the former place in some
MSS.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[30:4](sbe2217.htm#fr_168.md) Ettho ’varae is
usually 'ceasing from it, i.e. activity.' But here the commentators
explain it as translated above.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[31:1](sbe2217.htm#fr_169.md) Samu*tth*iyâ is
commonly used in the sense of right effort, and thus explained by the
commentators in this place, though we should expect the contrary.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[31:2](sbe2217.htm#fr_170.md) The words in
brackets \[ \] are a gloss upon the preceding sentence. If we leave them
out, the rest forms half a *s*loka.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[31:3](sbe2217.htm#fr_171.md) Laghubhûya, i.e.
nirvâ*n*a.
