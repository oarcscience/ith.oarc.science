#### FIFTH LESSON.

Thus I say: a lake is full of water, it is in an even plain, it is free
from dust, it harbours (many fish) <span
id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_216). Look! he (the teacher.md) stands in the
stream (of knowledge) and is guarded in all directions. Look! there are
great Seers in the world, wise, awakened, free from acts. Perceive the
truth: from a desire of (a pious) end they chose a religious life. Thus
I say. (1)

He whose mind is always wavering, does not reach abstract
contemplation <span id="fr_220"></span>[2](#fn_217.md). Some, bound (by
worldly ties), are followers (i.e. understand the truth); some who are
not bound, are followers. How should he not despond who amongst
followers is a non-follower? 'But that is truth beyond doubt, what has
been declared by the *G*inas.' (2)

Whatever <span id="fr_221"></span>[3](#fn_218.md) a faithful, well-disposed
man, on entering the order, thought to be true, that may afterwards
appear to him true; what he thought to be true, that may afterwards
appear to him untrue; what he thought to be untrue, that may afterwards
appear to him true; what he thought to be untrue, that may afterwards
appear to him true. What he thinks to be true, that may, on
consideration, appear to him true, whether it be true or untrue. What he
thinks to be untrue, that may, on consideration, appear to him untrue,
whether it be true or untrue. But he

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

who reflects should say unto him who does not reflect: Consider it to be
true. Thus the connection (i.e. the continuity of sins) is broken. (3)

Regard this as the course of the zealous one, who stands (in obedience
to the spiritual guide). In this point do not show yourself a fool <span
id="fr_222"></span>[1](sbe2229.htm#fn_219.md)!

As it would be unto thee, so it is with him whom thou intendest to kill.
As it would be unto thee, so it is with him whom thou intendest to
tyrannise over. As it would be unto thee, so it is with him whom thou
intendest to torment. I n the same way (it is with him) whom thou
intendest to punish, and to drive away. The righteous man who lives up
to these sentiments, does therefore neither kill nor cause others to
kill (living beings). He should not intentionally cause the same
punishment for himself <span id="fr_223"></span>[2](sbe2229.htm#fn_220.md).
(4)

The Self is the knower (or experiencer), and the knower is the Self.
That through which one knows, is the Self. With regard to this (to know)
it (the Self) is established <span
id="fr_224"></span>[3](sbe2229.htm#fn_221.md). Such is he who maintains the
right doctrine of Self. This subject has truly been explained. Thus I
say. (5)
