#### SECOND LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### BEGGING FOR A COUCH <span id="fr_382"></span>[1](#fn_376.md).

#### FIRST LESSON.

If a monk or a nun want to ask for a lodging, and having entered a
village or scot-free town, &c., conceive that lodging to contain eggs,
living beings, &c., they should not use it for religious postures,
night's-rest, or study <span id="fr_383"></span>[2](#fn_377). (1.md)

But if the lodging contains only few eggs or few living beings, &c.,
they may, after having inspected and cleaned it, circumspectly use it
for religious postures, &c. Now, if they conceive that the householder,
for the sake of a Nirgrantha and on behalf of a fellow-ascetic (male or
female, one or many), gives a lodging which he has bought or stolen or
taken, though it was not to be taken nor given, but was taken by force,
by acting sinfully towards all sorts of living beings, they should not
use for religious postures, &c., such a lodging which has been
appropriated by the giver himself, &c. (see II, I, I, § 1i).

The same holds good if there be instead of a fellow-ascetic many
*S*rama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as, guests, paupers, and beggars. But if the
lodging has been

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

appropriated by another man than the giver, &c., they may, after having
inspected and cleaned it, circumspectly use it for religious postures,
&c. (2)

A monk or a nun, knowing that the layman has, for the sake of the
mendicant, matted the lodging, whitewashed it, strewn it (with grass,
&c.), smeared it (with cowdung), levelled, smoothed, or perfumed it (or
the floor of it), should not use that lodging, which has been prepared
by the giver himself, &c., for religious postures. But if it has been
prepared by another person, &c., they may circumspectly use it for
religious postures. (3)

A monk or a nun, knowing that a layman will, for the sake of a
mendicant, make small doors large, &c. (all as in II, 1, 2, § 7, down
to) spread his couch or place it outside, should not use such a lodging
which has been appropriated by the giver himself, &c., for religious
postures, &c. But if it has been appropriated by another person, &c.,
they may circumspectly use it for religious postures, &c. (4)

Again, a monk or a nun, knowing that the layman, for the sake of the
mendicant, removes from one place to another, or places outside, bulbs
or roots or leaves or flowers or fruits or seeds or grass-blades of
water plants, should not use such a lodging, which is appropriated by
the giver himself, for religious postures, &c. But if it has been
prepared by another person, &c., they may circumspectly use it for
religious postures, &c. (5)

A monk or a nun, knowing that the layman, for the sake of the mendicant,
removes from one place to another, or places outside, a chair or a board
or a ladder or a mortar, should not use such a lodging-place, &c. (all
as at the end of the last paragraph). (6)

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

A monk or a nun should not use for religious postures, &c., a
lodging-place above ground, as a pillar or a raised platform or a
scaffold or a second story or a flat roof, likewise no underground place
(except under urgent circumstances). If by chance they are thus lodged,
they should there not wash or clean their hands or feet or eyes or teeth
or mouth with hot or cold water; nor should they put forth there any
other secretion, as excrements, urine, saliva, mucus, bilious humour,
ichor, blood, or any other part of the bodily humours.

The Kevalin says: This is the reason: Making secretions he might stumble
or fall; stumbling or falling he might hurt his hand, &c. (II, I, 7, §
1), or any other limb of his body, or kill, &c., all sorts of living
beings. Hence it has been said to the mendicant, &c., that he should use
no above-ground lodging-place for religious postures, &c. (7)

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not use, for religious
postures, a lodging-place used by the householder, in which there are
women, children, cattle, food, and drink. This is the reason: A
mendicant living together with a householder's family may have an attack
of gout, dysentery, or vomiting; or some other pain, illness, or disease
may befall him; the layman might, out of compassion, smear or anoint the
mendicant's body with oil or ghee or butter or grease, rub or shampoo it
with perfumes, drugs, lodhra, dye, powder, padmaka, then brush or rub it
clean; clean, wash, or sprinkle it with hot or cold water, kindle or
light a fire by rubbing wood on wood; and having done so, he might dry
or warm (the mendicant's body).

Hence it has been said to the mendicant, &c.,

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

that he should not use for religious postures, &c., a lodging-place
which is used by the householder. (8)

This is (another) reason: While a mendicant lives in a lodging used by
the householder, the householder or his wife, &c., might bully,
scold <span id="fr_384"></span>[1](#fn_378.md), attack or beat each other.
Then the mendicant might direct his mind to approval or dislike.: 'Let
them bully each other!' or, 'Let them not bully each other!' &c. &c.

Hence it has been said to the mendicant, &c., that he should not use,
for religious postures, &c., a lodging-place used by the householder.
(9)

This is (another) reason: While the mendicant lives together with
householders, the householder might, for his own sake, kindle or light
or extinguish a fire-body. Then the mendicant might direct his mind to
approval or dislike: Let them kindle or light or extinguish a
fire-body;' or, 'Let them not do so.'

Hence it has been said to the mendicant, &c. (see above). (10)

This is (another) reason: While the mendicant lives together with
householders, he might see the householder's earrings or girdle or
jewels or pearls or gold and silver <span
id="fr_385"></span>[2](#fn_379.md) or bracelets (those round the wrist and
those round the upper arm) or necklaces (those consisting of three
strings, or those reaching halfway down the body, or those consisting of
eighty

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

strings or forty strings or one string or strings of pearls, golden
beads or jewels) or a decked or ornamented girl or maiden. Thus the
mendicant might direct his mind to approval or dislike: 'Let her be
thus;' or, 'Let her not be thus.' So he might say, so he might think.
Hence it has been said to the mendicant, &c. (see above). (11)

This is (another) reason: While a mendicant lives together with
householders, the householder's wives, daughters, daughters-in-law,
nurses, slave-girls or servant-girls might say: 'These reverend
*S*rama*n*as, &c., have ceased from sexual intercourse; it behoves them
not to indulge in sexual intercourse: whatever woman indulges with them
in sexual intercourse, will have a strong, powerful, illustrious,
glorious, victorious son of heavenly beauty.' Hearing and perceiving
such talk, one of them might induce the mendicant ascetic to indulge in
sexual intercourse.

Hence it has been said to the mendicant, &c., that he should not use for
religious postures, &c., a lodging used by the householder.

This is the whole duty, &c.

Thus I say. (12)

nisîhiyâ = ni*s*îthikâ, svâdhyâya; *k*ete*gg*â = *k*intayet. The last
word is elsewhere translated dadyât.

Guzerati translation renders it nirbha*mkh*e, which is derived from
Sanskrit nirbharts.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[123:2](sbe2258.htm#fr_385.md) Hira*nn*e
suva*nn*e. The commentators explain these two words, which are synonyms
in the later language, as 'raw and wrought gold, or coined gold.' I
translate 'gold and silver,' because the distinction of the commentators
seems rather farfetched, and because silver would be missed in
enumerations like the present one.
