#### THIRD LESSON.

A sage who is well instructed in the law and leads a life of abstinence,
is always a destroyer of the effects of works <span
id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_245.md). To a mendicant who is little
clothed <span id="fr_249"></span>[2](#fn_246.md) and firm in control, it
will not occur (to think): My clothes are torn, I shall beg for (new)
clothes; I shall beg for thread; I shall beg for a needle; I shall mend
(my clothes); I shall darn them; I shall repair them; I shall put them
on; I shall wrap myself in them. (1)

The unclothed one, who excels in this (abstinence), will often be
molested by (sharp blades of) grass, by cold, heat, gnats, and
mosquitoes. The unclothed one, who effects scarcity (of his wants or of
his karman), bears these and various other hardships. He is fit for
penance, as has been declared by the Revered One. Understanding this in
all respects and with his whole mind, he should perfectly know
righteousness. The great heroes (i.e. the Tîrthakaras) who for a long
time <span id="fr_250"></span>[3](#fn_247.md) walked

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

in the former years <span id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_248.md), the worthy
ones bore the troubles (mentioned above); endowed with perfect knowledge
they had lean arms and very little flesh and blood. He who discontinues
(to sin) and is enlightened, is said to have crossed (the sa*m*sâra), to
be liberated, and to have ceased (to act). Thus I say. (2)

But can discontent lay hold of a mendicant, who has ceased to act and
leads a religious life, for a long time controlling himself? He advances
in his spiritual career and exerts himself. As an island which is never
covered with water, so is the law taught by the noble ones (a safe
refuge for those in danger). They are free from desires, free from
murder, beloved, wise, learned. For their benefit has been the exertion
of the Revered One; as birds (feed) their young ones, so are the
disciples regularly to be instructed day and night. Thus I say. (3)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_245"></span>[57:1](sbe2232.htm#fr_248.md) Âdânam explained as
implements which are not requisite for the law.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[57:2](sbe2232.htm#fr_249.md) A*k*ela, literally,
unclothed. But it has that meaning only when it is applied to a
*g*inakalpika. A *g*inakalpika is a monk who wears no clothes and uses
the hollow of the hand for an alms-bowl. The only implements he has are
the broom (ra*g*ohara*n*am) and the piece of cloth which the monk places
before the mouth while speaking, in order to prevent insects from
getting into his mouth (mukhavastrikâ).

<span id="fn_247"></span>[57:3](sbe2232.htm#fr_250.md) *K*irarâta,
literally, long night. Compare dîrgharâtra, which the Bauddhas and
*G*ainas employ in the sense we have given to *k*irarâtam in the text.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[58:1](sbe2232.htm#fr_251.md) Puvvâi*m* vâsâi*m*,
the former years are those long periods by which the length of the early
Tîrthakaras' life is measured. Walked means walked in righteousness.
