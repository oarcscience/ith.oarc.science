#### FOURTH LESSON.

Then, after a time, he falls in sickness: those with whom he lives
together, first grumble at him, and he afterwards grumbles at them. But
they cannot help thee or protect thee, nor canst thou help them or
protect them. (1)

Knowing pleasure and pain separately <span
id="fr_133"></span>[1](#fn_132.md), they trouble themselves about the
enjoyment (of the external objects). For some men in this world have
(such a character that) they will desire to enjoy their portion, whether
it be large or small, in the three ways <span
id="fr_134"></span>[2](#fn_133.md): Then, at one time, it will be
sufficiently large, with many resources. Then, at another time, his
heirs divide it, or those who have no living steal it, or the king takes
it away, or it is ruined in some way or other, or it is consumed by the
conflagration of the house. Thus a fool, doing cruel acts, comes
ignorantly to grief. (2)

Wisely reject hope and desire <span id="fr_135"></span>[3](#fn_134.md), and
extracting that thorn (i.e. pleasure) thou (shouldst act rightly).
People who are enveloped by delusion do not understand this: he who
(gathers wealth) will, perhaps, not have the benefit of it.

The world is greatly troubled by women. They (viz. men) forsooth say,
'These are the vessels (of happiness).' But this leads them to pain, to
delusion,

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

to death, to hell, to birth as hell-beings or brute beasts. The fool
never knows the law. (3)

Thus spake the hero <span id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_135.md): 'Be careful
against this great delusion; the clever one should have done with
carelessness by considering death in tranquillity, and that, the nature
of which is decay (viz. the body); these (pleasures), look! will not
satisfy (thee). Therefore have done with them! Sage, look! this is the
great danger, it should overcome none whomsoever. He is called a hero
who is not vexed by (the hardships caused) by control. He should not be
angry because the (householder) gives him little. If turned off, he
should go. Thou shouldst conform to the conduct of the sages.' Thus I
say. (4)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_132"></span>[21:1](sbe2213.htm#fr_133.md) The meaning seems to
be: If people do not know that pleasure and pain are the result of their
own works, &c.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[21:2](sbe2213.htm#fr_134.md) The commentators
give no explanation of what is meant by 'the three ways,' yet cf. 3, §
5.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[21:3](sbe2213.htm#fr_135.md) The words âsa*m*
*k*a *kh*a*m*da*m* *k*a vigi*mk*a dhîre form a trish*t*ubh pâda.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[22:1](sbe2213.htm#fr_136.md) The MSS. have udâhu
dhîre. The last word is a frequent mistake for vîre, which is adopted by
the commentators. They explain udâhu by ud-âha = uktavân.
