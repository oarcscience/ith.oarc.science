#### FIFTH LESSON.

When a monk or a nun on entering the abode of a householder sees that
the first portion of the meal is being thrown away <span
id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_341.md) or thrown down, or taken away, or
distributed, or eaten, or put off, or has already been eaten or removed;
that already other *S*rama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as, guests, paupers, and
beggars go there in great haste; (they might think), 'Hallo! I too shall
go there in haste.' As this would be sinful, they should not do so. (1)

When a monk or a nun on a begging-tour comes upon walls or gates, or
bolts or holes to fit them, they should, in case there be a byway, avoid
those (obstacles), and not go on straight.

The Kevalin says: This is the reason: Walking there, he might stumble or
fall down; when he stumbles or falls down, his body might become
contaminated with fæces, urine, phlegmatic humour, mucus, saliva, bile,
matter, semen, or blood. And if his body has become soiled, he should
not wipe or

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

rub or scratch or clean <span id="fr_348"></span>[1](#fn_342.md) or warm or
dry it on the bare ground or wet earth \[or dusty earth <span
id="fr_349"></span>[2](#fn_343.md)\] on a rock or a piece of clay
containing life, or timber inhabited by worms, or anything containing
eggs, living beings, &c. (down to) cobwebs; but he should first beg for
some straw or leaves, wood or a potsherd, which must be free from dust,
resort with it to a secluded spot, and on a heap of ashes or bones, &c.
(see II, 1, 1, § 2), which he has repeatedly examined and cleaned, he
should circumspectly wipe or rub, warm or dry (his body). (2)

When a monk or a nun on a begging-tour perceives a vicious cow coming
towards them, or a vicious buffalo coming towards them, or a vicious
man, horse, elephant, lion, tiger, wolf, panther, bear, hyena,
*s*arabha, shakal, cat, dog, boar, fox, leopard coming towards them,
they should, in case there be a byway, circumspectly avoid them, and not
walk on straight. (3)

When a monk or a nun on a begging-tour comes on their way upon a pit,
pillar, thorns, or unsafe, marshy or uneven ground, or mud, they should,
in case there be a byway, avoid these (obstacles), and not walk on
straight.

When a monk or a nun on a begging-tour perceives that the entrance of a
householder's abode is secured by a branch of a thorn bush, they should
not, without having previously got the (owner's) permission, and having
examined and swept (the entrance), make it passable or enter and leave
(the

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

house). But they may circumspectly do so, after having got the (owner's)
permission, and having examined and swept it. (4)

When a monk or a nun on a begging-tour knows that a *S*rama*n*a or a
Brâhma*n*a, a guest, pauper or beggar has already entered (the house),
they should not stand in their sight or opposite the door <span
id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_344.md).

The Kevalin <span id="fr_351"></span>[2](#fn_345.md) says: This is the
reason: Another, on seeing him, might procure and give him food, &c.
Therefore it has been declared to the mendicants: This is the statement,
this is the reason, this is the order, that he should not stand in the
other mendicants' sight or opposite the door.

Knowing this, he should go apart and stay where no people pass or see
him. Another man may bring and give him food, &c., while he stays where
no people pass or see him, and say unto him: 'O long-lived *S*rama*n*a!
this food, &c., has been given for the sake of all of you; eat it or
divide it among you.' Having silently accepted the gift, he might think:
Well, this is just (enough) for me!' As this would be sinful, he should
not do so.

Knowing this, he should join the other beggars, and after consideration
say unto them <span id="fr_352"></span>[3](#fn_346.md): 'O long-lived
*S*rama*n*as! this food, &c., is given for the sake of all of you; eat
it or divide it among you.' After these words another might answer him:
'O long-lived

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *S*rama*n*a!
distribute it yourself.' Dividing the food, &c., he should not (select)
for himself too great a portion, or the vegetables, or the conspicuous
things, or the savoury things, or the delicious things, or the nice
things, or the big things; but he should impartially divide it, not
being eager or desirous or greedy or covetous (of anything). When he
thus makes the division, another might say: 'O long-lived *S*rama*n*a!
do not divide (the food); but let us, all together, eat and drink.' When
he thus eats, he should not select for himself too great a portion, &c.;
but should eat and drink alike with all, not being desirous, &c. <span
id="fr_353"></span>[1](#fn_347) (5.md)

When a monk or a nun on a begging-tour perceives that a Srama*n*a or
Brâhma*n*a, a beggar or guest has already entered the house, they should
not overtake them and address (the householder) first. Knowing this,
they should go apart and stay where no people pass or see them. But when
they perceive that the other has been sent away or received alms, and
has returned, they may circumspectly enter the house and address the
householder.

This certainly is the whole duty, &c.

Thus I say. (6)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_341"></span>[99:1](sbe2251.htm#fr_347.md) In honour of the
gods.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[100:1](sbe2251.htm#fr_348.md) This stands for
uvvale*gg*a vâ uvva*tt*e*gg*â vâ (udvaled vâ udvarted vâ), for which
words, denoting some rather indistinct varieties of rubbing, I know no
adequate English words.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[100:2](sbe2251.htm#fr_349.md) The words in
brackets are the translation of varia lectio.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[101:1](sbe2251.htm#fr_350.md) This might also be
translated: at an opposite door.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[101:2](sbe2251.htm#fr_351.md) The following
passage is not explained in the commentaries, and is wanting in the
oldest MS., though supplied on the margin. It may therefore be concluded
that the whole passage, the greater part of which is typical, is a later
addition.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[101:3](sbe2251.htm#fr_352.md) Âloe*gg*â. The
scholiast explains it here by dar*s*ayet, he should show the food, &c.
Professor Oldenberg has identified this word with the Pâli âro*k*eti.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[102:1](sbe2251.htm#fr_353.md) The scholiast says
that the way to procure food, &c., as described in this paragraph,
should only be resorted to under pressing circumstances.
