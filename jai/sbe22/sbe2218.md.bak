#### THIRD LESSON.

'Knowing the connection of the world, (carelessness is not for his
benefit <span id="fr_172"></span>[4](#fn_171).md).' 'Look at the exterior

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (world from
analogy with thy own) self; \[then\] thou wilt neither kill nor destroy
(living beings);' viz. out of reciprocal regard \[well examining\] he
does no sinful act. What is the characteristic of a sage? 'Recognising
the equality (of all living beings), he appeases
[himself](errata.htm#0).' (1.md)

Knowing the highest good, one should never be careless;  
Guarding one's self, always prudent, one should pass life on the right
road.

'One should acquire disregard of sensual enjoyment, being with a great
one (i.e. a god) or the small ones (men).' When one knows whence men
come and where they go, and when both ends are out of sight <span
id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_172.md), one is not cut, nor slit, nor burnt,
nor struck <span id="fr_174"></span>[2](#fn_173) (2.md) by any one in the
whole world <span id="fr_175"></span>[3](#fn_174.md).

Some do not remember what preceded the present: 'what has been his past?
what will be his future?' Some men here say: 'what has been his past,
that will be his future <span id="fr_176"></span>[4](#fn_175.md).'

There is no past thing, nor is there a future one;  
So opine the Tathâgatas.

He whose karman has ceased and conduct is right,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

who recognises the truth (stated above) and destroys sinfulness
(thinks):

What is discontent and what is pleasure? not subject to either, one
should live;

Giving up all gaiety, circumspect and restrained, one should lead a
religious life. (3)

Man! Thou art thy own friend; why wishest thou for a friend beyond
thyself? Whom he knows as a dweller on high <span
id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_176.md), him he should know as a dweller far
(from sin) and whom he knows as a dweller far (from sin), him he should
know as a dweller on high. Man! restraining thyself (from the outward
world) 'thou wilt get free from pain.' Man, understand well the truth!
exerting himself in the rule of truth a wise man overcomes Mâra. (4)

'The gifted man <span id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_177.md), following the
law, sees well his true interest.' In a twofold way <span
id="fr_179"></span>[3](#fn_178.md), for the sake of life's splendour,
honour and glory (some men exert themselves), wherein they go astray.
The gifted <span id="fr_180"></span>[2](#fn_177.md), touched by calamity,
are not confounded. 'Mind this! the worthy one, in this world, gets out
of the creation <span id="fr_181"></span>[4](#fn_179).' Thus I say. (5.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_171"></span>[31:4](sbe2218.htm#fr_172.md) This is a very
difficult passage. Connection (sandhi) is explained in different ways,
as karmavivara, samyag*gñ*ânâvâpti, and the state of the soul, which has
only temporarily and not thoroughly come to rest. To complete the
sentence the commentators add pramâdo na *s*reyase. As the words of the
text form the pâda of a *s*loka, it is probable that something like
pamâo neva se*gg*ase <span id="page_32">p. 32</span> concluded the
hemistich. The meaning is, 'Make good use of any opening to get out of
worldly troubles.'

<span id="fn_172"></span>[32:1](sbe2218.htm#fr_173.md) See 1, lesson 4.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[32:2](sbe2218.htm#fr_174.md) The reading of the
Nâgâr*g*unîyas, according to the commentary, was, 'Knowing well and
essentially the five (perceptions) in the object and the three degrees
(i.e. good, middle, bad), in the twofold (i.e. what is to be avoided and
to be adopted), one is not marred by either (love and hate).' These
words form a *s*loka.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[32:3](sbe2218.htm#fr_175.md) The commentary
connects these words with the preceding sentence, saying that the
accusative stands for the instrumental, by any one.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[32:4](sbe2218.htm#fr_176.md) The words of the
original read like a trish*t*ubh in disorder; the same is the case with
a different reading quoted by the commentator.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[33:1](sbe2218.htm#fr_177.md) There is apparently
a pun in the text: u*kk*âlaiya*m* is explained by u*kk*âlayitâram =
remover (of sins), but as contrasted with dûrâlaiya it has the meaning
we have adopted above.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[33:2](sbe2218.htm#fr_180.md) With knowledge, &c.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[33:3](sbe2218.htm#fr_179.md) For the sake of love
and hate, or worldly and heavenly bliss.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[33:4](sbe2218.htm#fr_181.md) If loyâloya is
omitted, the last words form the half of a *s*loka.
