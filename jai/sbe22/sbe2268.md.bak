### SIXTH LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### BEGGING FOR A BOWL <span id="fr_438"></span>[1](#fn_432.md).

#### FIRST LESSON.

A monk or a nun wanting to get a bowl, may beg for one made of
bottle-gourd or wood or clay, or such-like bowls. If he be a youthful,
young, &c. (see II, 5, 1, § 1) monk, he may carry with him one bowl, not
two <span id="fr_439"></span>[2](#fn_433.md).

A monk or a nun should not resolve to go farther than half a Yo*g*ana to
get a bowl.

As regards the acceptance of a bowl, those four precepts which have been
given in (the First Lesson of the First Lecture, called) <span
id="fr_440"></span>[3](#fn_434.md) Begging of Food, concerning one
fellow-ascetic, &c., should be repeated here, the fifth is that
concerning many *S*rama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as.

A monk or a nun should not accept a bowl which the layman has, for the
mendicant's sake, bought, &c. (see the Lecture called Begging of
Clothes <span id="fr_441"></span>[4](#fn_435)). (I .md)

A monk or a nun should not accept any very expensive bowls of the
following description: bowls made of iron, tin, lead, silver, gold,
brass, a mixture of

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

gold, silver, and copper, pearl, glass, mother of pearl, horn, ivory,
cloth, stone, or leather; for such very expensive bowls are impure and
unacceptable. (2)

A monk or a nun should not accept bowls which contain a band of the same
precious materials specialised in § 2; for &c. (3)

For the avoidance of these occasions to sin there are four rules for
begging a bowl to be known by the mendicants.

Now this is the first rule:

A monk or a nun may beg for a bowl specifying its quality, viz.
bottle-gourd or wood or clay. If they beg for such a bowl, or the
householder gives it, they may accept it, for it is pure and acceptable.

This is the first rule. (4)

Now follows the second rule:

A monk or a nun may ask for a bowl, which they have well inspected, from
the householder or his wife, &c. After consideration, they should say:
'O long-lived one! (or, O sister!) please give me one of these bowls,
viz. one made of bottle-gourds or wood or clay.' If they beg for such a
bowl, or the householder gives it, they may accept it; for &c.

This is the second rule. (5)

Now follows the third rule:

A monk or a nun may beg for a bowl which has been used by the former
owner or by many people. If they beg for it, &c. (see § 5).

This is the third rule. (6)

Now follows the fourth rule:

A monk or a nun may beg for a left-off bowl which no other *S*rama*n*a
or Brâhma*n*a, guest, pauper, or beggar wants. If they beg for it, &c.
(see § 5).

This is the fourth rule.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

A monk or a nun having adopted one of these four rules should not say,
&c. (see II, 1, t r, § 12, all down to) we respect each other
accordingly. (7)

A householder may perhaps say to a mendicant begging in the prescribed
way: 'O long-lived *S*rama*n*a! return after a month,' &c. (all as in
the Lecture called Begging of Clothes <span
id="fr_442"></span>[1](#fn_436)). (8.md)

The householder may say (to one of his people): 'O long-lived one! (or,
O sister!) fetch that bowl, rub it with oil, ghee, fresh butter or
marrow, we shall give it,' &c. (see II, 5, 1, § 11); or wash, wipe, or
rub it with perfumes,' &c.; or 'wash it with cold or hot water;' or
'empty it of the bulbs,' &c. (see II, 5, 1, §§ 11 and 12). (9)

The householder may say (to the mendicant): 'O long-lived *S*rama*n*a!
stay a while till they have cooked or prepared our food, &c., then we
shall give you, O long-lived one! your alms-bowl filled with food or
drink; it is not good, not meet that a mendicant should get an empty
alms-bowl.' After consideration, the mendicant should answer: 'O
long-lived one! (or, O sister!) it is indeed not meet for me to eat or
drink food &c. which is âdhâkarmika; do not cook or prepare it; if you
want to give me anything, give it as it is.' After these words the
householder might offer him the alms-bowl filled with food or drink
which had been cooked or prepared: he should not accept such an
alms-bowl, for it is impure and unacceptable. (10)

Perhaps the householder will bring and give the mendicant an alms-bowl;
the mendicant should then, after consideration, say: 'O long-lived one!
(or, O

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

sister!) I shall in your presence closely inspect the interior of the
bowl.'

The Kevalin says: This is the reason: In the alms-bowl there might be
living beings or seeds or grass. Hence it has been said to the
mendicant, &c., that he should closely inspect the interior of the
alms-bowl. (11)

All that has been said in the Lecture called Begging of Clothes (II, 5,
I, § 15 down to the end) is mutatis mutandis to be repeated here. (In §
15, add before perfumes) with oil, ghee, butter or marrow.

This is the whole duty, &c.

Thus I say. (12)
