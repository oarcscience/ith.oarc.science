#### SECOND LESSON.

A mendicant may exert himself, or stand or sit or lie in a burying-place
or in an empty house or in a mountain cave or in a potter's workshop. A
householder may approach a mendicant who stays in any of these places,
and say unto him: O long-lived *S*rama*n*a! I shall give you what I have
bought or stolen or taken, though it was not to be taken, nor given, but
was taken by force, viz. food, drink, dainties and spices, clothes, an
alms-bowl, a plaid, a broom--by acting sinfully against all sorts of
living beings; or I shall prepare you snug lodgings; eat (the offered
food), dwell (in the prepared house <span
id="fr_265"></span>[1](#fn_262)). (1)

O long-lived *S*rama*n*a! A mendicant should thus refuse a householder
of good sense and ripe age: O long-lived householder! I do not approve
of thy words, I do not accept thy words, that, for my sake, thou givest
unto me what thou hast bought or stolen or taken, though it was not to
be taken, nor given, but was taken by force, viz. food, drink, dainties
and spices, clothes, an alms-bowl, a plaid, a broom--by

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

acting sinfully against all sorts of living beings; or that thou
preparest pleasant lodgings for me. O long-lived householder! I have
given up this, because it is not to be done. (2) A mendicant may exert
himself, &c. (first sentence of § 1). A householder, without betraying
his intention, may approach him who stays in some one of the
above-mentioned places, and give unto him what has been taken, &c. (all
as above, down to) or prepare pleasant lodgings, and accommodate the
mendicant with food (and lodging). A mendicant should know it by his own
innate intelligence, or through the instruction of the highest (i.e. the
Tîrthakaras), or having heard it from others: This householder,
forsooth, for my sake injures all sorts of living beings, to give me
food, &c., clothes, &c., or to prepare pleasant lodgings. A mendicant
should well observe and understand this, that he may order (the
householder) not to show such obsequiousness. Thus I say. (3)

Those who having, with or without the mendicant's knowledge, brought
together fetters <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_263), become angry (on
the monk's refusal) and will strike him, saying: Beat, kill, cut, burn,
roast, tear, rob, despatch, torture him! But the hero, come to such a
lot, will bravely bear it, or tell him the code of conduct, considering
that he is of a different habit; or by guarding his speech he should in
due order examine the subject, guarding himself.

This has been declared by the awakened ones: The faithful should not
give to dissenters food, &c., clothes, &c., nor should they exhort them
(to give),

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

nor do them service, always showing the highest respect. Thus I say. (4)

Know the law declared by the wise Brâhma*n*a one should give to one of
the same faith food, &c., clothes, &c., and one should exhort him (to
give) or do him service, always showing the highest respect. Thus I say.
