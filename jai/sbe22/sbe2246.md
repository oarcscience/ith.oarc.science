#### FOURTH LESSON.

The Venerable One was able to abstain from indulgence of the flesh <span
id="fr_317"></span>[3](#fn_313.md), though never attacked by

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

diseases. Whether wounded or not wounded, he desired not medical
treatment. (1)

Purgatives and emetics, anointing of the body and bathing, shampooing
and cleansing of the teeth do not behove him, after he learned (that the
body is something unclean). (2)

Being averse from the impressions of the senses <span
id="fr_318"></span>[1](#fn_314.md), the Brâhma*n*a wandered about, speaking
but little. Sometimes in the cold season the Venerable One was
meditating in the shade. (3)

In summer he exposes himself to the heat, he sits squatting in the sun;
he lives on rough (food): rice, pounded jujube, and beans. (4)

Using these three, the Venerable One sustained himself eight months.
Sometimes the Venerable One did not drink for half a month or even for a
month. (5)

Or he did not drink for more than two months, or even six months, day
and night, without desire (for drink). Sometimes he ate stale food. (6)

Sometimes he ate only the sixth meal, or the eighth, the tenth, the
twelfth; without desires, persevering in meditation. (7)

Having wisdom, Mahâvîra committed no sin himself, nor did he induce
others to do so, nor did he consent to the sins of others. (8)

Having entered a village or a town, he begged for food which had been
prepared for somebody else. Having got clean <span
id="fr_319"></span>[2](#fn_315.md) food, he used it, restraining the
impulses. (9)

When there were hungry crows, or thirsty beings stood in his way, where
he begged, or when he saw them flying repeatedly down, (10)

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

When a Brâhma*n*a or *S*rama*n*a, a beggar or guest, a *K*â*nd*âla <span
id="fr_320"></span>[1](#fn_316), a cat, or a dog stood in his way, (11.md)

Without ceasing in his reflections, and avoiding to overlook them <span
id="fr_321"></span>[2](#fn_317.md), the Venerable One slowly wandered
about, and, killing no creatures, he begged for his food. (12)

Moist or dry or cold food, old beans, old pap, or bad grain, whether he
did or did not get such food, he was rich (in control). (13)

And Mahâvîra meditated (persevering) in some posture, without the
smallest motion; he meditated in mental concentration on (the things)
above, below, beside, free from desires. (14)

He meditated free from sin and desire, not attached to sounds or
colours; though still an erring mortal (*kh*admastha), he wandered
about, and never acted carelessly. (15)

Himself understanding the truth and restraining the impulses for the
purification of the soul, finally liberated, and free from delusion, the
Venerable One was well guarded during his whole life. (16)

This is the rule which has been followed, &c.
