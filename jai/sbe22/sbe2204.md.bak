#### SECOND LESSON <span id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_101.md).

The (living) world is afflicted, miserable, difficult to instruct, and
without discrimination. In this world full of pain, suffering by their
different acts, see the benighted ones cause great pain. (1) See! there
are beings individually embodied (in earth; not one all-soul). See!
there are men who

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

control themselves, (whilst others only) pretend to be houseless (i.e.
monks, such as the Bauddhas, whose conduct differs not from that of
householders), because one destroys this (earth-body) by bad and
injurious doings, and many other beings, besides, which he hurts by
means of earth, through his doing acts relating to earth. (2) About this
the Revered One has taught the truth: for the sake of the splendour,
honour, and glory of this life, for the sake of birth, death, and final
liberation, for the removal of pain, man acts sinfully towards earth, or
causes others to act so, or allows others to act so. This deprives him
of happiness and perfect wisdom. About this he is informed when he has
understood or heard, either from the Revered One or from the monks, the
faith to be coveted. (3) There are some who, of a truth, know this (i.e.
injuring) to be the bondage, the delusion, the death, the hell. For
this <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_102.md) a man is longing when he
destroys this (earth-body) by bad, injurious doings, and many other
beings, besides, which he hurts by means of earth, through his doing
acts relating to earth. Thus I say. (4)

As somebody may cut or strike a blind man (who cannot see the wound), as
somebody may cut or strike the foot, the ankle, the knee, the thigh, the
hip, the navel, the belly, the flank, the back, the bosom, the heart,
the breast, the neck, the arm, the finger, the nail, the eye, the brow,
the forehead, the head, as some kill (openly), as some extirpate

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (secretly), (thus
the earth-bodies are cut, struck, and killed though their feeling is not
manifest). (5)

He who injures these (earth-bodies) does not comprehend and renounce the
sinful acts; he who does not injure these, comprehends and renounces the
sinful acts. Knowing them, a wise man should not act sinfully towards
earth, nor cause others to act so, nor allow others to act so. H e who
knows these causes of sin relating to earth, is called a reward-knowing
sage. Thus I say. (6)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_101"></span>[3:2](sbe2204.htm#fr_102.md) After the chief
tenets of *G*ainism with regard to soul and actions have briefly been
stated in the first lesson, the six remaining lessons of the first
lecture treat of the actions which injure the six classes of lives or
souls. The Gainas seem to have arrived at their concept of soul, not
through the search after the Self, the self-existing unchangeable
principle in the ever-changing world of phenomena, but through the
perception of life. For the most general *G*aina term for soul is life
(*g*îva), which is identical with self (âyâ, âtman). There are
numberless lives or souls, not only embodied in animals, men, gods,
hell-beings (tasa, trasa), and plants (va*n*assaî, vanaspati), but also
in the four elements--earth, water, fire, wind. Earth, &c., regarded as
the abode of lives is called earth-body, &c. These bodies are only
perceptible when an infinite number of them is united in one place. The
earth-lives, &c., possess only one organ, that of feeling; they have
undeveloped (avyakta)intellect and feelings (vedanâ), but no limbs, &c.
The doctrines about these elementary lives are laid down in Bhadrabâhu's
Niryukti of our Sûtra, and are commented upon in *S*îlâṅka's great
commentary of it. They are very abstruse, and deal in the most minute
distinctions, which baffle our comprehension.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[4:1](sbe2204.htm#fr_103.md) I*kk*’ attha*m*. The
commentators think this to be a reference to the sentence, For the sake
of the splendour, &c. It would be more natural to connect it with the
foregoing sentence; the meaning is, For bondage, &c., men commit
violence, though they believe it to be for the happiness of this life.
