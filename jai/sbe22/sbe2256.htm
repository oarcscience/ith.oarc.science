<p>A single mendicant, having collected alms for many, might, without consulting his fellow-ascetics, give them to those whom he list; as this would be sinful, he should not do so. Taking the food, he should go there (where his teacher &amp;c. is) and speak thus: 'O long-lived <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a! there are near or remote (spiritual) relations of mine: a teacher, a sub-teacher, a religious guide, a Sthavira, a head of a Ga<I>n</I>a, a Ga<I>n</I>adhara, a founder of a Ga<I>n</I>a; forsooth, I shall give it them.' The other may answer him: 'Well now, indeed, O long-lived one! give such a portion!' As much as the other commands, thus much he should give; if the other commands the whole, he should give the whole. (1)</p>  
<p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></A></p>  
<p>A single mendicant, having collected agreeable food, might cover it with distasteful food, thinking: 'The teacher or sub-teacher, &amp;c., seeing what I have received, might take it himself; indeed, I shall not give anything to anybody!' As this would be sinful, he should not do so.</p>  
<p>Knowing this, he should go there (where the other mendicants are), should put the vessel in his out-stretched hand, show it (with the words): Ah, this! ah, this!' and hide nothing. (2)</p>  
<p>A single mendicant, having received some food, might eat what is good, and bring what is discoloured and tasteless; as this would be sinful, he should not do so. (3)</p>  
<p>A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept any part of the sugar-cane&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_375"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, whether small or large, pea-pods, seed-pods, of which articles a small part only can be eaten, and the greater part must be rejected; for such things are impure and unacceptable. (4)</p>  
<p>A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept meat or fish containing many bones, so that only a part of it can be eaten and the greater part must be rejected; for such meat or fish, &amp;c., is impure and unacceptable. (5)</p>  
<p>A monk or a nun on a begging-tour may be invited to meat or fish containing many bones, (by the householder who addresses him thus): 'O long-lived <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a! will you accept meat with many bones?' Hearing such a communication, he should</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></A></p>  
<p>say, after consideration: 'O long-lived one! (or, O sister!) it is not meet for me to accept meat with many bones; if you want to give me a portion of whatever size, give it me; but not the bones!' If after these words the other (i.e. the householder) should fetch meat containing many bones, put it in a bowl and return with it, (the mendicant) should not accept such a bowl, whether out of the other's hand or a vessel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_376"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for it is impure and unacceptable. But if he has inadvertently accepted it, he should not say: 'No, away, take it!' Knowing this, he should go apart, and in a garden or an up&acirc;<I>s</I>raya, where there are few eggs, &amp;c., (all down t o) cobwebs, eat the meat or fish, and taking the bones, he should resort to a secluded spot and leave them on a heap of ashes, &amp;c. (see II, 1, 1, &sect; 2). (6)</p>  
<p>If a householder should fetch fossil salt or sea salt, put it in a bowl and return with it, a monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept it out of the other's hand or vessel; for, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>But if he has inadvertently accepted it, he should return with it to the householder, if he is not yet too far away, and say, after consideration&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_377"></A><A HREF="#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: 'Did you give me this with your full knowledge or without it?' He might answer: I did give it without my full knowledge; but indeed, O long-lived one! I now give it you; consume it or divide it (with others)!'</p>  
<p>Then being permitted by, and having received it from, the householder, he should circumspectly eat it or drink it, and what he cannot eat or drink he</p>

<p>should share with his fellow-ascetics in the neighbourhood, who follow the same rules of conduct, are agreeable, and not to be shunned; but if there are no fellow-ascetics, the same should be done as in case one has received too much food.</p>  
<p>This is the whole duty, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>Thus I say. (7)</p>
