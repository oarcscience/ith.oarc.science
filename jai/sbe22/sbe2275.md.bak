### ELEVENTH LECTURE <span id="fr_475"></span>[5](#fn_469.md).

A monk or a nun should not resolve to go where they will hear sounds of
a M*ri*daṅga, Nandîm*ri*daṅga, or *Gh*allarî <span
id="fr_476"></span>[6](#fn_470.md), or any such-like various sounds of
drums. (1)

If a monk or a nun hear any sounds, viz. of the Vi*n*â, Vipam*k*î,
Vadvîsaka, Tu*n*aka, Pa*n*aka, Tumbavî*n*ikâ, or Dha*m*ku*n*a, they
should not resolve to go where they will hear any such-like various
sounds of stringed instruments. (2)

The same precepts apply to sounds of kettledrums, viz. of the Tâla,
Lattiyâ, Gohiyâ <span id="fr_477"></span>[7](#fn_471.md), or Kirikiriyâ;
(3)

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

Also to sounds of wind instruments, viz. the conch, flute, Kharamukhî,
or Piripiriyâ. (4)

A <span id="fr_478"></span>[1](#fn_472.md) monk or a nun should not, for
the sake of hearing sounds, go to walls or ditches, &c. (see II, 3, 3,
§§ 1 and 2); (5)

Nor to marshes, pasture grounds, thickets, woods, strongholds in woods,
mountains, strongholds in mountains; (6)

Nor to villages, towns, markets, or a capital, hermitages, cities,
halting-places for caravans; (7)

Nor to gardens, parks, woods, forests, temples, assembly halls, wells;
(8)

Nor to towers, pathways, doors, or town gates; (9) Nor where three or
four roads meet, nor to courtyards or squares; (1o)

Nor to stables (or nests) of buffaloes, cattle, horses, elephants, &c.
(see 10, § 12); (11)

Nor to places where buffaloes, bulls, horses, &c., fight; (12)

Nor to places where herds of cattle, horses, or elephants are kept; (13)

Nor to places where story-tellers or acrobats perform, or where
continuously story-telling, dramatical plays, singing, music,
performance on the Vi*n*â, beating of time, playing on the Tûrya, clever
playing on the Pa*t*aha is going on; (14)

Nor to places where quarrels, affrays, riots, conflicts between two
kingdoms, anarchical or revolutionary disturbances occur; (15)

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

Nor to places where a young well-attended girl, well-attired and
well-ornamented, is paraded, or where somebody is led to death. (16)

A monk or a nun should not, for the sake of hearing sounds, go to places
where there are many great temptations <span
id="fr_479"></span>[1](#fn_473.md), viz. where many cars, chariots,
Mle*kkh*as, or foreigners meet. (17)

A monk or a nun should not, for the sake of hearing sounds, go to great
festivals where women or men, old, young, or middle-aged ones are
well-dressed and ornamented, sing, make music, dance, laugh, play,
sport, or give, distribute, portion or parcel out plenty of food, drink,
dainties, and spices. (18)

A monk or a nun should not like or love, desire for, or be enraptured
with, sounds of this or the other world, heard or unheard ones, seen or
unseen ones.

This is the whole duty, &c.

Thus I say. (19)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_469"></span>[183:5](sbe2275.htm#fr_475.md) Saddasattikkayam.
Lecture on Sounds.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[183:6](sbe2275.htm#fr_476.md) These are different
kinds of drums.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[183:7](sbe2275.htm#fr_477.md) Lattiyâ and gohiyâ
would be in Sanskrit lattikâ and godhikâ; both words are names of
lizards.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[184:1](sbe2275.htm#fr_478.md) The beginning, 'If
a monk or a nun hear particular sounds somewhere, viz.,' and the end,
'they should not resolve to go to suchlike or other places for the sake
of hearing sounds,' are in the text repeated in all, §§ 5-16. In the
translation the text has been somewhat Abridged.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[185:1](sbe2275.htm#fr_479.md) Mahâsava,
mahâsrava. The word has probably here the original meaning, conflux; or
mahâsava is a mistake for mahosava, which would be identical with
mahussava, great festivals, in the next paragraph.
