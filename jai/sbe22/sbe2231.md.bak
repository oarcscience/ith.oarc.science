#### SECOND LESSON.

Though some know the misery of the world, have relinquished their former
connections, have given up ease, live in chastity, and, whether monk or
layman, thoroughly understand the law, they are not able (to persevere
in a religious life). The ill-disposed, giving up the robe, alms-bowl,
blanket, and broom, do not bear the continuous hardships that are
difficult to bear. He who prefers pleasures will, now or after an
hour <span id="fr_240"></span>[2](#fn_237.md), be deprived (of the
body <span id="fr_241"></span>[3](#fn_238), not to recover it.md) for an
infinite space of time. And thus they do not cross (the sa*m*sâra), for
the sake of these pleasures which entail evil consequences and are
associated with others of their kind. (1)

But some who embrace the law, will practise it, being careful about its
outward signs; not giving way to worldliness, but being firm. Knowing
(and renouncing) all lust, a devout man becomes a great sage when he
breaks all bonds, thinking: Nothing

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

belongs to me. A man who, thinking, I am I <span
id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_239), exerts himself for this (creed.md), ceases
(to act), is houseless, walks about bald-headed. The naked, fasting
(monk), who combats the flesh, will be abused, or struck, or hurt <span
id="fr_243"></span>[2](#fn_240.md); he will be upbraided with his former
trade, or reviled with untrue reproaches. Accounting (for this
treatment) by his former sins, knowing pleasant and unpleasant
occurrences, he should patiently wander about. Quitting all
worldliness <span id="fr_244"></span>[3](#fn_241.md) one should bear all
(disagreeable) feelings, being possessed of the right view <span
id="fr_245"></span>[4](#fn_242). (2.md)

Those are called naked, who in this world, never returning (to a worldly
state), (follow) my religion according to the commandment. This highest
doctrine has here been declared for men. Delighted with this, destroying
that (i.e. the effect of works), he will successively <span
id="fr_246"></span>[5](#fn_243.md) give up sinfulness <span
id="fr_247"></span>[6](#fn_244.md), after having come to a knowledge of it.
Here (in our religion) some live as single mendicants. Therefore a wise
man should lead the life of an ascetic by collecting pure alms or any
alms in all sorts of families. 'If (the food) be of good or bad smell,
or if dreadful beasts inflict pain on (other) beings'--

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

all that happens to you, you will firmly bear it. Thus I say. (3)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_237"></span>[55:2](sbe2231.htm#fr_240.md) I.e. after a short
time.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[55:3](sbe2231.htm#fr_241.md) The body with five
organs, in which alone liberation can be realised.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[56:1](sbe2231.htm#fr_242.md) I have nothing to do
with anybody else.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[56:2](sbe2231.htm#fr_243.md) Lûsie. The
commentator translates it by lu*nk*ita, to tear out the hair. This would
be a rather difficult operation on the bald head of a *G*aina monk.
Lûsiya is, of course, the Sanskrit lûshita, hurt.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[56:3](sbe2231.htm#fr_244.md) Visottiya*m*.
Sanskrit vi*s*rotasikâ (?) = *s*aṅkâ.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[56:4](sbe2231.htm#fr_245.md) Samiyada*m*sa*n*e.
The commentator explains it by samitadar*s*ana. I think it corresponds
to samyagdar*s*ana.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[56:5](sbe2231.htm#fr_246.md) Pariyâe*n*a*m* =
paryâya. The commentator interprets it by *s*râma*n*ya.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[56:6](sbe2231.htm#fr_247.md) Âdâ*n*i*gg*a*m* =
âdânîya. It means usually faith; but I have here translated it according
to the commentary.
