<p>In that period, in that age lived the Arhat <I>Ri</I>shabha, the Ko<I>s</I>alian&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_666"></A><A HREF="#fn_659"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, four important moments of whose life happened when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Uttar&acirc;sh&acirc;<I>dh</I>&acirc;; the fifth, when in conjunction with Abhi<I>g</I>it: (204) in Uttar&acirc;sh&acirc;<I>dh</I>&acirc; he descended from heaven, &amp;c. (all down to) in Abhi<I>g</I>it he obtained final liberation. (205)</p>  
<p>In that period, in that age, in the fourth month of summer, in the seventh fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>a, on its fourth day, the Arhat <I>Ri</I>shabha, the Ko<I>s</I>alian, descended from the great Vim&acirc;na called Sarv&acirc;rthasiddha, where he had lived for thirty-three S&acirc;garopamas, here on the continent <I>G</I>amb&ucirc;dv&icirc;pa, in Bharatavarsha, in Ikshv&acirc;kubh&ucirc;mi, and in the middle of the night, &amp;c., he took the form of an embryo in the womb of Marudev&icirc;, wife of the patriarch&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_667"></A><A HREF="#fn_660"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> N&acirc;bhi. (206)</p>  
<p>The knowledge of the Arhat <I>Ri</I>shabha about this, &amp;c. (all as in the case of Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra, but note the following differences: the first dream is a bull 'coming forward with his face,' the other (mothers of T&icirc;rthakaras see first) an elephant. She (Marudev&icirc;) relates them to N&acirc;bhi, the patriarch; there</p>

<p>are no interpreters of dreams; N&acirc;bhi, the patriarch, himself interprets them). (207)</p>  
<p>In that period, in that age the Arhat <I>Ri</I>shabha, the Ko<I>s</I>alian,--in the first month of summer, in the first fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of <I>K</I>aitra, on its eighth day, &amp;c.,--(Marudev&icirc;), perfectly healthy herself, gave birth to a perfectly healthy boy. (208)</p>  
<p>(The circumstances connected with the birth of <I>Ri</I>shabha are the same as in the case of that of Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra, only that the contents of &sect;&sect; 100 and 101 do not apply to the present case.) (209)</p>  
<p>The Arhat <I>Ri</I>shabha, the Ko<I>s</I>alian, belonged to the K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa gotra, and he had five names: <I>Ri</I>shabha, First King, First Mendicant, First <I>G</I>ina, and First T&icirc;rthakara. (210)</p>  
<p>The Arhat <I>Ri</I>shabha, the Ko<I>s</I>alian, clever, with the aspirations of a clever man, of great beauty, controlling (his senses), lucky, and modest, lived two millions of former years&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_668"></A><A HREF="#fn_661"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as a prince, and six millions three hundred thousand former years as a king. During his reign he taught, for the benefit of the people, the seventy-two sciences, of which writing is the first, arithmetic the most important, and the knowledge of omens the last, the sixty-four accomplishments of women, the hundred arts, and the three occupations of men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_669"></A><A HREF="#fn_662"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. At last he anointed his</p>

<p>hundred sons as kings, and gave each a kingdom. Then the Lauk&acirc;ntika god, following the established custom, &amp;c. (see &sect;&sect; 110-112, down to) indigent persons. In the first month of summer, in the first fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of <I>K</I>aitra, on its eighth day, in the latter part of the day, riding in his palankin called Sudarsan&acirc;, followed on his way by a train of gods, men, and Asuras, &amp;c. (<I>Ri</I>shabha) went right through the town Vin&icirc;t&acirc; to the park called Siddh&acirc;rtha Vana, and proceeded to the excellent tree A<I>s</I>oka. There, &amp;c. (see &sect; 116, down to) four handfuls. When the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>&acirc;, he, after fasting two and a half days without drinking water, put on a divine robe, and together with four thousand of high, noble, royal persons, and Kshatriyas, he tore out his hair, and leaving the house entered the state of houselessness. (211)</p>  
<p>The Arhat <I>Ri</I>shabha, the Ko<I>s</I>alian, for one thousand years neglected his body, &amp;c. (see &sect;&sect; 1 I7-120, down to) meditated upon himself for one thousand years. Thereupon--it was in the fourth month of winter, the seventh fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of Ph&acirc;lguna, on its eleventh day, in the early part of the day, when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>&acirc;, outside of the town Purimat&acirc;la, in the park called <I>S</I>aka<I>t</I>amukha, under the excellent tree Nyagrodha--(<I>Ri</I>shabha) after fasting three and a half days without drinking water, being engaged in deep meditation, reached the infinite, &amp;c. (see &sect; 120, down to) highest knowledge and intuition called Kevala, &amp;c. (see &sect; 121, down to) moment. (212)</p>  
<p><a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="green">p. 284</font></A></p>  
<p>The Arhat <I>Ri</I>shabha, the Ko<I>s</I>alian, had eighty-four Ga<I>n</I>as and eighty-four Ga<I>n</I>adharas. (213)</p>  
<p>The Arhat <I>Ri</I>shabha, the Ko<I>s</I>alian, had an excellent community of eighty-four thousand <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>as with <I>Ri</I>shabhasena at their head; (214) three hundred thousand nuns with Brahm&icirc;sundar&icirc; at their head; (215) three hundred and five thousand lay votaries with <I>S</I>rey&acirc;<I>m</I>sa at their head; (216) five hundred and fifty-four thousand female lay votaries with Subhadr&acirc; at their head; (217) four thousand seven hundred and fifty sages who knew the fourteen P&ucirc;rvas, &amp;c.; (218) nine thousand sages who were possessed of the Avadhi knowledge; (219) twenty thousand Kevalins; (220) twenty thousand six hundred sages who could transform themselves; (221) twelve thousand six hundred and fifty sages of vast intellect, &amp;c.; (222) twelve thousand six hundred and fifty professors; (223) twenty thousand male and forty thousand female disciples who had reached perfection; (224) twenty-two thousand nine hundred sages in their last birth, &amp;c. (225)</p>  
<p>The Arhat <I>Ri</I>shabha, the Ko<I>s</I>alian, instituted, &amp;c. (see &sect; 146, down to) the former ended after numberless generations, the latter from the next Muh&ucirc;rta after his Kevaliship. (226)</p>  
<p>In that period, in that age the Arhat <I>Ri</I>shabha, the Ko<I>s</I>alian, lived two millions of former years as a prince, six millions three hundred thousand former years as a king, together eight millions three hundred thousand former years as a householder; a thousand (former) years in a state inferior to perfection, nine-and-ninety thousand former years as a Kevalin, together a hundred thousand former years as a <I>S</I>rama<I>n</I>a, and eight</p>  
<p><a name="page_285"><font size="1" color="green">p. 285</font></A></p>  
<p>millions four hundred thousand years on the whole. When his fourfold Karman was exhausted, and in this Avasarpi<I>n</I>&icirc; era the Sushamadu<I>h</I>sham&acirc; period had nearly elapsed, only three years and eight and a half months being left, in the third month of winter, in the fifth fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of M&acirc;gha, on its thirteenth day, in the early part of the day when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Abhi<I>g</I>it, (<I>Ri</I>shabha), after fasting six and a half days without drinking water, on the summit of mount Ash<I>t</I>&acirc;pada, in the company of ten thousand monks in the Samparya&#7749;ka position, died, &amp;c. (all down to) freed from all pains. (227)</p>  
<p>Since the time that the Arhat <I>Ri</I>shabha, the Ko<I>s</I>alian, died, &amp;c. (all down to) freed from all pains, three years and eight and a half months elapsed; thereupon one ko<I>t</I>i of ko<I>t</I>is of S&acirc;garopamas, less forty-two thousand and three years and eight and a half months, elapsed. At that time the Venerable Ascetic Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra died; after his Nirv&acirc;<I>n</I>a nine centuries elapsed, of the tenth century this is the eightieth year.</p>
