#### FIFTH LESSON.

That for this (viz. pleasure) the wants of the world should be supplied
by bad injurious doings: for one's own sons, daughters,
daughters-in-law, kinsmen, nurses, kings, male and female slaves, male
and female servants, for the sake of hospitality, of supper and
breakfast, the accumulation of wealth is effected. (1)

(This is) here for the enjoyment of some men. (But a wise man) exerting
himself, houseless, noble, of noble intellect, of noble perception
recognises the proper moment (for all actions). He should not accept,
nor cause others to accept, or permit them

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

to accept anything unclean <span id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_136). Free
from uncleanliness he should wander about. (2)

Being not seen in buying and selling, he should not buy, nor cause
others to buy, nor consent to the buying of others. This mendicant who
knows the time, the strength (of himself), the measure (of all things),
the practice <span id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_137), the occasion (for
begging, &c.), the conduct, the religious precepts <span
id="fr_139"></span>[3](#fn_138), the true condition (of the donor or
hearer), who disowns all things not requisite for religious
purposes <span id="fr_140"></span>[4](#fn_139), who is under no
obligations, he proceeds securely (on the road to final liberation)
after having cut off both (love and hate). Clothes, alms-bowls,
blankets, brooms, property <span id="fr_141"></span>[5](#fn_140), straw
mats, with regard to these things he should know (what is unclean). When
he receives food he should know the quantity required. This has been
declared by the Revered One: he should not rejoice in the receipt of a
gift, nor be sorry when he gets nothing. Having got much, one should not
store it away; one should abstain from things not requisite for
religious purposes. With a mind different (from that of common people) a
seer abandons (these things). This is the road taught by the noble ones,
well acquainted with which one should not be defiled (by sin). Thus I
say. (3)

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

Pleasures are difficult to reject, life is difficult to prolong. That
man, certainly, who loves pleasures, is afflicted (by their loss), is
sorry in his heart, leaves his usual ways, is troubled, suffers pain.
The farsighted one who knows the world, knows its inferior part (hell),
its upper part (heaven), its side-long part (the state of brute beasts).
He who knows the relation (of human affairs, viz.) that he who desires
for the world is always turned round (in the sa*m*sâra), is called among
mortals a hero, who liberates those who are fettered. (4)

As the interior (of the body is loathsome), so is the exterior; as the
exterior, so is the interior. In the interior of the body he perceives
the foul interior humours, he observes their several courses (or
eruptions). A well-informed man knowing (and renouncing the body and
pleasures), should not eat (his saliva <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_141)); he should not oppose himself to the
(current of knowledge). Certainly, that man who engages in worldly
affairs, who practises many tricks, who is bewildered by his own doings,
acts again and again on that desire which increases his
unrighteousness <span id="fr_143"></span>[2](#fn_142). Hence the above
has been said for the increase of this (life) <span
id="fr_144"></span>[3](#fn_143). (A man addicted to pleasures) acts as
if immortal, and puts great faith (in pleasure); but when he perceives
that this body sustains pains, he cries in his ignorance. Therefore keep
in your mind what I say. (5)

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

A heretic <span id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_144) professes to cure (the
love of pleasure), while he kills, cuts, strikes, destroys, chases away,
resolves to do what has not been done before. To whom he applies the
cure--enough of that fool's affection <span
id="fr_146"></span>[2](#fn_145); or he who has (the cure) applied, is a
fool. This does not apply to the houseless. Thus I say. (6)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_136"></span>[23:1](sbe2214.htm#fr_137) Âmagandha, unclean,
is also a Buddhist term; see Rhys Davids' Buddhism, pp. rat, 181.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[23:2](sbe2214.htm#fr_138) Kheda = abhyâsa, or
the pain of worldly existence.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[23:3](sbe2214.htm#fr_139) Samaya.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[23:4](sbe2214.htm#fr_140) Pariggaha; it might
also be translated, who disowns attachment.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[23:5](sbe2214.htm#fr_141) Oggaha = avagraha
property e*g*. the ground or space which the householder allows the
mendicant who stays in his house.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[24:1](sbe2214.htm#fr_142) I.e. what he has
thrown away, vomited, as it were; pleasures.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[24:2](sbe2214.htm#fr_143) Vera*m* va*ddh*ei
appa*n*o, apparently the close of a *s*loka; see I, 3, 2, 3.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[24:3](sbe2214.htm#fr_144) The commentators
supply *s*arîrasya, the body. For sinful acts injure the bodies of
living beings; therefore they are increased by our abstaining from sin.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[25:1](sbe2214.htm#fr_145) Pa*md*ite =
pa*nd*ita*m*mânî, who believes or pretends to be a learned man.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[25:2](sbe2214.htm#fr_146) Ala*m* bâlassa
sa*m*ge*n*a, a pâda of *s*loka; followed by the words in note
[2](#fn_142), [p. 24](#page_24), it forms the hemistich of verse 3 in
the Second Lesson of the next Chapter.
