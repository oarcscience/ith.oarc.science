#### SIXTH LESSON.

When a monk or a nun on a begging-tour perceives that many hungry
animals have met and come together in search of food, e. g. those of the
chicken-kind or those of the pig-kind, or that crows

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

have met and come together, where an offering is thrown on the ground,
they should, in case there be a byway, avoid them and not go on
straight. (1)

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not stand leaning against the
door-post of the householder's abode, or his sink or spitting-pot, nor
in sight of, or opposite to his bathroom or privy; nor should they
contemplate a loophole or a mended spot or a fissure (of the house) or
the bathing-house, showing in that direction with an arm or pointing
with a finger, bowing up and down. (2)

Nor should they beg, pointing with a finger at the householder, or
moving him with a finger, or threatening him with a finger, or
scratching him with a finger, or praising him, or using coarse language.
(3)

If he sees somebody eating, e*g*. the householder or his wife, &c., he
should after consideration say: 'O long-lived one! (or, O sister!) will
you give me some of that food?' After these words the other might wash
or wipe his hand or pot or spoon or plate with cold or hot water <span
id="fr_354"></span>[1](#fn_348.md). He should after consideration say: 'O
long-lived one! (or, O sister!) do not wash or wipe your hand or pot or
spoon or plate! If you want to give me something, give it as it is!'
After these words the other might give him a share, having washed or
wiped his hand, &c., with cold or hot water. But he should not accept
anything out of such a hand, &c., which has been before treated thus;
for it is impure and unacceptable. (4)

It is also to be known that food, &c., is impure

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

and unacceptable, which is given with a wet hand, though the hand be not
purposely wetted. (5)

The same rule holds good with regard to a moistened hand, &c., and a
dusty hand, &c., and a hand which is soiled with clay, dew, orpiment,
vermilion, realgar, collyrium, white chalk, alum, rice-flour, kukkusa,
ground drugs. (6)

It is also to be known that he may accept such food, &c., which is given
with a soiled hand, &c., to one similarly soiled (i.e. with what one is
to receive), or to one unsoiled, with hand similarly soiled; for such
food, &c., is pure and acceptable. (7)

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept flattened grains,
grains containing much chaff, &c. (see II, 1, 1, § 5), which a layman,
for the sake of the mendicant, has ground <span
id="fr_355"></span>[1](#fn_349.md), grinds, or will grind, has winnowed,
winnows, or will winnow on a rock or a piece of clay containing life,
&c. (see II, 1, 5, § 2, all down to) cobwebs; for such large, parched
grains, &c., are impure and unacceptable. (8)

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept fossil salt or sea
salt which a householder, for the sake of the mendicant, has ground or
pounded, grinds or pounds, will grind or pound on a rock or a piece of
clay containing life, &c.; for such-like fossil salt or sea salt is
impure and unacceptable. (9)

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

accept food, &c., which is prepared over the fire; for such food is
impure and unacceptable. The Kevalin says: This is the reason: A layman
will kill the fire-bodies, by wetting or moistening, wiping or rubbing,
throwing up or turning down the food, &c., for the sake of the
mendicant. Hence it has been declared to the mendicants: This is the
statement, this is the reason, this is the order, that they should not
accept food, &c., which has been prepared over the fire, &c.

This certainly is the whole duty, &c.

Thus I say. (10)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_348"></span>[103:1](sbe2252.htm#fr_354.md) Sîodagaviga*d*a,
usi*n*odagaviga*d*a. Viga*d*a, Sanskrit vika*t*a, is explained apkâya.
It is therefore cold or hot water which is to be considered as
containing life.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[104:1](sbe2252.htm#fr_355.md) The subject
asa*mg*ae, the uncontrolled one, i.e. layman, stands in the singular,
but the verb in the plural. The same irregularity occurs in the next
paragraph. The commentator accounts for it simply by saying:
ekava*k*anâdhikâre pi *kh*ândasatvât tadvyatyayena bahuva*k*ana*m*
drash*t*avyam, pûrvatra vâ *g*âtâv ekava*k*anam.
