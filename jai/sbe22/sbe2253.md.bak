#### SEVENTH LESSON.

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept food, &c., which has
been placed on a post or pillar or beam or scaffold or loft <span
id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_350.md) or platform or roof or some such-like
elevated place; for such food fetched from above is impure and
unacceptable. The Kevalin says: This is the reason: The layman might
fetch and erect a stool or a bench or a ladder or a handmill, get upon
it, and getting upon it fall or tumble down. Thus he might hurt his foot
or arm or breast or belly or head or some other part of his body; or he
might kill or frighten or bruise or smash or crush or afflict or pain or
dislocate all sorts

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

of living beings. Therefore he should not accept such-like food, &c.,
fetched from above. (1)

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept food, &c., which a
layman, for the sake of the mendicant, has taken from a granary or vault
by contorting himself up and down and horizontally; thinking that
such-like food is brought from underground <span
id="fr_357"></span>[1](#fn_351). (2.md)

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept food, &c., which is
kept in earthenware. The Kevalin says: This is the reason: The layman
might, for the sake of the mendicant, break the earthen vessel
containing the food, &c., and thereby injure the earth-body; in the same
way he might injure the fire-body, the wind-body, plants and animals; by
putting it again (in earthenware), he commits the pa*kkh*âkamma sin.
Hence it has been said to the mendicant, &c., that he should not accept
food, &c., which is put in earthenware. (3)

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept food, &c., placed on
the earth-body, the wind-body, the fire-body, for such food is impure
and unacceptable. The Kevalin says: This is the reason: A layman might,
for the sake of the mendicant, stir or brighten the fire, and taking the
food, &c., down from it, might give it to the mendicant. Hence it has
been said, &c., that he should accept no such food. (4)

When a monk or a nun on a begging-tour sees that a layman might, for the
sake of the mendicant,

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

cool too hot food, &c., by blowing or fanning with a winnowing basket or
fan or a palm leaf or a branch or a part of a branch or a bird's tail or
a peacock's tail or a cloth or a corner of a cloth or the hand or the
mouth, they should, after consideration, say (to the householder or his
wife): 'O long-lived one! (or, O sister!) do not blow or fan the hot
food, &c., with a winnowing basket, &c.; but if you want to give it me,
give it as it is.' After these words the other might give it after
having blown or fanned it with a winnowing basket, &c.; such-like food
they should not accept, because it is impure and unacceptable. (5)

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept food, &c., which is
placed on vegetable or animal matter <span
id="fr_358"></span>[1](#fn_352.md); for such food is impure and
unacceptable. (6)

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept water which has been
used for watering flour or sesamum or rice, or any other such-like water
which has been recently used for washing, which has not acquired a new
taste, nor altered its taste or nature, nor has been strained; for
such-like water is impure and unacceptable. But if it has long ago been
used for washing, has acquired a new taste, has altered its taste or
nature, and has been strained, it may be accepted, for it is pure and
acceptable. (7)

When a monk or a nun on a begging-tour finds water used for washing
sesamum, chaff or barley, or rainwater <span
id="fr_359"></span>[2](#fn_353.md) or sour gruel or pure water, they
should, after consideration, say (to the householder or his wife): 'O
long-lived one! (or, O sister!) will you give

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

me some of this water?' Then the other may answer him: 'O long-lived
*S*rama*n*a! take it yourself by drawing it with, or pouring it in, your
bowl!' Such-like water, whether taken by himself or given by the other,
he may accept. (8)

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not accept such water as has
been taken from the bare ground, &c. (see II, 1, 5, § 2, all down to)
cobwebs, or water which the layman fetches in a wet or moist or dirty
vessel, mixing it with cold water.

This certainly is the whole duty, &c.

Thus I say. (9)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_350"></span>[105:1](sbe2253.htm#fr_356.md) Mâla. The word is
not explained in the *T*îkâ and Dîpikâ; the Guzerati translation says
that the word is lokapratîta, commonly understood. It is probably the
Marâthî mâ*l* or mâ*l*â; the former word denotes a loft, floored with
bamboos; the second, the room formed by overlaying with slight sticks
the cross-beams of a house, a loft, an erection or stand in a cornfield,
scaffolding (of a building). Molesworth, Marâthî and English Dictionary,
s. v.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[106:1](sbe2253.htm#fr_357.md) The original has
bho mâloha*d*a*m* ti na*kk*â. Bho mâloha*d*a is explained
adhomâlâh*ri*tam. Mâloha*d*a, which I translate 'fetched from above,' is
the technical term for things affected by the dosha under question.
