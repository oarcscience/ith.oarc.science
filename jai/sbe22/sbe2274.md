### TENTH LECTURE <span id="fr_465"></span>[2](#fn_459).

A monk or a nun being pressed by nature should, in case they have not
their own broom, beg for that of a fellow-ascetic. A monk or a nun,
seeing that the ground is infected by eggs or living beings, &c., should
not ease nature on such an unfit ground. But if the ground is free from
eggs or living beings, &c., then they may ease nature on such a ground.
(1)

A monk or a nun, knowing that the householder with regard to such a
place for the sake of one or many, male or female fellow-ascetics, for
the sake of many *S*rama*n*as or Brâhma*n*as whom he has well counted,
kills living beings and commits various sins, should not ease nature on
such a place or any other of the same sort, whether that place be
appropriated by another person or not <span
id="fr_466"></span>[3](#fn_460), &c. (see II, 1, 1, § 13). (2 and 3).

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

Now he should know this: If that place has not been appropriated by
another person, &c., he may ease nature on such a place (after having
well inspected and cleaned it). (4)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature on a ground which for their sake
has been prepared or caused to be prepared (by the householder), or has
been occupied by main force, or strewn with grass, or levelled, or
smeared (with cowdung), or smoothed, or perfumed. (5)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature on a ground where the
householders or their sons remove from outside to inside, or vice versa,
bulbs, roots, &c. (see II, 2, 1, § 5). (6)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature on a pillar or bench or scaffold
or loft or tower or roof. (7)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature on the bare ground or on wet
ground or on dusty ground or on a rock or clay containing life, or on
timber inhabited by worms or on anything containing life, as eggs,
living beings, &c. (8)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature in a place where the householders
or their sons have. do, or will put <span
id="fr_467"></span>[1](#fn_461) by bulbs, roots, &c. (9)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature in a place where the householders
or their sons have sown, sow, or will sow rice, beans, sesamum, pulse,
or barley. (1o)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature in a place where there are heaps
of refuse, furrows, mud,

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

stakes, sprigs, holes, caves, walls, even or uneven places <span
id="fr_468"></span>[1](#fn_462). (11)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature in fireplaces, layers (or nests)
of buffaloes, cattle, cocks, monkeys, quails, ducks <span
id="fr_469"></span>[2](#fn_463), partridges, doves, or francoline
partridges. (12)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature in a place where suicide is
committed, or where (those who desire to end their life) expose their
body to vultures, or precipitate themselves from rocks or trees <span
id="fr_470"></span>[3](#fn_464), or eat poison, or enter fire. (I 3)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature in gardens, parks, woods,
forests, temples, or wells. (14)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature in towers, pathways, doors, or
town gates. (15)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature where three or four roads meet,
nor in courtyards or squares. (16)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature where charcoal or potash is
produced, or the dead are burnt, or on the [sarcophaguses](errata.htm#2)
or shrines of the dead. (17)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature at sacred places near rivers,
marshes or ponds, or in a conduit. (18)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature in fresh clay pits, fresh pasture
grounds for cattle, in meadows or quarries. (19)

A monk or a nun should not ease nature in a field of shrubs, vegetables,
or roots. (20)

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

A monk or a nun should not ease nature in woods of A*s*ana <span
id="fr_471"></span>[1](#fn_465), *S*ana <span
id="fr_472"></span>[2](#fn_466), Dhâtakî <span
id="fr_473"></span>[3](#fn_467), Ketaki <span
id="fr_474"></span>[4](#fn_468), Mango, A*s*oka, Punnâga, or other
such-like places which contain leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, or
sprouts. (21)

A monk or a nun should take their own chamber-pot or that of somebody
else, and going apart with it, they should ease nature in a secluded
place where no people pass or see them, and which is free from eggs or
living beings, &c.; then taking (the chamber-pot), they should go to a
secluded spot, and leave the excrements there on a heap of ashes, &c.
(see II, 1, 1, § 2).

This is the whole duty, &c.

Thus I say. (22)

<span id="fn_459"></span>[180:2](sbe2274.htm#fr_465)
U*kk*ârapâsava*n*asattikkao, discharging of feces and urine.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[180:3](sbe2274.htm#fr_466)
Purisa*m*taraka*d*a, here translated svîk*ri*ta. The text proceeds
*g*ava bahiyâ niha*d*a*m* vâ, which I do not know how to apply to the
object in question. As § 3 differs from § 2 only in giving <span
id="page_181">p. 181</span> the negative attributes
(apurisa*m*taraka*d*a*m*), I have contracted both paragraphs in the
translation.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[181:1](sbe2274.htm#fr_467) Parisâ*d*e*m*su vâ,
explained parikshepa*n*âdikâ*h* kriyâ*h* kuryu*h*.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[182:1](sbe2274.htm#fr_468) The translation of
some of the words in the text is merely conjectural.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[182:2](sbe2274.htm#fr_469) Va*tt*aya. I think
this is the modern ba*tt*ak, duck.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[182:3](sbe2274.htm#fr_470) The commentator
says: where they fall like a tree, having starved themselves to death,
or where they fall from trees.
