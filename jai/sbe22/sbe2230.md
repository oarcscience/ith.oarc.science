### SIXTH LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### THE CLEANING <span id="fr_233"></span>[1](#fn_230).

#### FIRST LESSON.

He who is awakened amongst men, preaches; the man to whom all these
classes of lives are well known, preaches the unparalleled wisdom. He
praises the road to liberation for those who well exert themselves, who
have forsworn cruelty, are zealous and endowed with knowledge. Thus some
great heroes are victorious; but, look, some others who are wanting in
control do not understand (the welfare of) their souls. Thus I say. (1)

As in a lake a greedy leaf-covered tortoise cannot rise up; as the trees
do not leave their place (though shaken by storms, &c.): thus men, born
in various families, cry bitterly because they are attached to the
objects of the senses <span id="fr_234"></span>[2](#fn_231); on account
of their sinfulness they do not reach liberation <span
id="fr_235"></span>[3](#fn_232). (2)

Now look at those who are born in these families to reap the fruit of
their own acts <span id="fr_236"></span>[4](#fn_233):

Boils and leprosy, consumption, falling sickness, blindness and
stiffness, lameness and humpbackedness, 1

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

Dropsy and dumbness, look! apoplexy(?) and eye-disease, trembling and
crippledness, elephantiasis and diabetes, 2

These are the sixteen diseases enumerated in due order; besides them
many illnesses and wounds occur. 3

Contemplating their (i.e. the creatures') death, knowing their births in
higher and lower regions, contemplating the fruit (of their acts), hear
about this according to truth. 4

There are said to be blind beings dwelling in darkness; once or
frequently meeting this lot, they experience pleasant and unpleasant
feelings. This has been declared by the awakened ones. (3) There are
beings endowed with voice, with taste, water-beings dwelling in water,
beings living in the air: 'beings torment beings. See the great danger
in this world <span id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_234);' many pains (are
the lot) of the creatures. Men who are given to their lusts, come to
destruction through their weak, frail body. 'The fool works hard,
thinking' that the unhappy one suffers many pains. 'Knowing that these
diseases are many, should the afflicted search after (remedies)?' See!
they are of no avail, have done with them! Sage! see this great danger!
Do not hurt anybody! Contemplate. Be attentive! I shall proclaim the
doctrine of renunciation <span id="fr_238"></span>[2](#fn_235). (4)

To reap the fruit of their acts they are born in these various families,
they increase, are born, grow up, become awakened, and leave the world
in due order as great sages. The lamenting parents say to them who
proceed on the glorious road: 'Do not

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

leave us!' (5) Consulting their own pleasure, indulging their passions,
'making a noise <span id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_236), the parents cry:'
No man who leaves his parents is (fit to become) a flood-crossing sage!
(The ascetic) does not take refuge there (in his family); for what could
attract him there?

He should always maintain this knowledge! Thus I say. (6)

their own acts' is, according to the commentary, the meaning of âyattâe

acts.
