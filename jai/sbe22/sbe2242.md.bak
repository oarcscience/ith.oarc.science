#### EIGHTH LESSON.

The wise ones who attain in due order <span
id="fr_291"></span>[3](#fn_287.md) to one of the unerring states (in which
suicide is prescribed), those who are rich in control and endowed with
knowledge, knowing the incomparable (religious death, should continue
their contemplation). (1)

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

Knowing the twofold (obstacles, i.e. bodily and mental), the wise ones,
having thoroughly learned the law, perceiving in due order (that the
time for their death has come), get rid of karman. (2)

Subduing the passions and living on little food <span
id="fr_292"></span>[1](#fn_288), he should endure (hardships.md). If a
mendicant falls sick, let him again take food. (3)

H e should not long for life, nor wish for death he should yearn after
neither, life or death. (4)

He who is indifferent and wishes for the destruction of karman, should
continue his contemplation. Becoming unattached internally and
externally, he should strive after absolute purity. (5)

Whatever means one knows for calming one's own life <span
id="fr_293"></span>[2](#fn_289.md), that a wise man should learn (i.e.
practise) in order to gain time (for continuing penance). (6)

In a village or in a forest, examining the ground and recognising it as
free from living beings, the sage should spread the straw <span
id="fr_294"></span>[3](#fn_290). (7.md)

Without food he should lie down and bear the pains which attack him. He
should not for too long time give way to worldly feelings which overcome
him. (8)

When crawling animals or such as live on high or below, feed on his
flesh and blood, he should neither kill them nor rub (the wound). (9)

Though these animals destroy the body, he should not stir from his
position,

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

After the â*s*ravas have ceased, he should bear (pains) as if he
rejoiced in them. (10)

When the bonds fall off, then he has accomplished his life.

(We shall now describe) a more exalted (method <span
id="fr_295"></span>[1](#fn_291).md) for a well-controlled and instructed
monk. (11)

This other law has been proclaimed by *Gñ*ât*ri*putra:

He should give up all motions except his own in the thrice-threefold
way <span id="fr_296"></span>[2](#fn_292). (12.md)

He should not lie on sprouts of grass, but inspecting the bare ground he
should lie on it.

Without any comfort and food, he should there bear pain. (13)

When the sage becomes weak in his limbs, he should strive after
calmness <span id="fr_297"></span>[3](#fn_293.md).

For he is blameless, who is well fixed and immovable (in his intention
to die). (14)

He should move to and fro (on his ground), contract and stretch (his
limbs) for the benefit of the whole body; or (he should remain quiet as
if he were) lifeless. (15)

He should walk about, when tired of (lying), or stand with passive
limbs; when tired of standing, he should sit down. (16)

Intent on such an uncommon death, he should regulate the motions of his
organs.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

Having attained a place swarming with insects, he should search for a
clean spot. (17)

He should not remain there whence sin would rise.

He should raise himself above (sinfulness), and bear all pains. (18)

And this is a still more difficult method <span
id="fr_298"></span>[1](#fn_294.md), when one lives according to it: not to
stir from one's place, while checking all motions of the body. (19)

This is the highest law, exalted above the preceding method:

Having examined a spot of bare ground he should remain there; stay O
Brâhma*n*a! (20)

Having attained a place free from living beings, he should there fix
himself.

He should thoroughly mortify his flesh, thinking: There are no obstacles
in my body. (21)

Knowing as long as he lives the dangers and troubles, the wise and
restrained (ascetic) should bear them as being instrumental to the
dissolution of the body. (22)

He should not be attached to the transitory pleasures, nor to the
greater ones; he should not nourish desire and greed, looking only for
eternal praise. (23)

He should be enlightened with eternal objects <span
id="fr_299"></span>[2](#fn_295.md), and not trust in the delusive power of
the gods;

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

a Brâhma*n*a should know of this and cast off all inferiority <span
id="fr_300"></span>[1](#fn_296). (24.md)

Not devoted to any of the external objects he reaches the end of his
life; thinking that patience is the highest good, he (should choose) one
of (the described three) good methods of entering Nirvâ*n*a. (25) Thus I
say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_285"></span>[74:1](sbe2241.htm#fr_289.md) Ahesa*n*i*gg*a: it
had those qualities which are required of a thing the mendicant may
accept.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[74:2](sbe2241.htm#fr_290.md) Ahâpariggahiya =
ahâparig*ri*hîta.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[74:3](sbe2242.htm#fr_291.md) The preceding
lessons treated of suicide conceded to sick persons as a means of
entering Nirvâ*n*a. The eighth lesson, which is written in *s*lokas,
describes the different kinds of religious deaths which form the end of
a twelve-years' mortification of the flesh (sa*m*lekhanâ). But the
ascetic must ask and get the permission of his Guru, before he commits
suicide.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[75:1](sbe2242.htm#fr_292.md) Compare lecture 7,
lesson 6, § 3.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[75:2](sbe2242.htm#fr_293.md) I.e. for preserving
the life, when too severe penance brings on sickness and the probability
of instant death.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[75:3](sbe2242.htm#fr_294.md) Here commences the
description of the bhaktapratyâkhyânamara*n*a, suicide by rejecting
food.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[76:1](sbe2242.htm#fr_295.md) Viz. the
iṅgitamara*n*a, which differs from the preceding one by the restriction
of the motions of the candidate for suicide to a limited space.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[76:2](sbe2242.htm#fr_296.md) I.e. of body,
speech, and mind; doing, or causing, or allowing to be done.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[76:3](sbe2242.htm#fr_297.md) He should not give
way to melancholy thoughts.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[77:1](sbe2242.htm#fr_298.md) It is called
pâovagama*n*a, translated by the commentators pâdapopagamana, remaining
motionless like a felled tree. This etymology, which is generally
adopted by the *G*ainas, is evidently wrong; for the Sanskrit prototype
is the Brahmanical prâyopagamana.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[77:2](sbe2242.htm#fr_299.md) This is the
scholiast's interpretation of nima*m*te*gg*â nimantrayet.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[78:1](sbe2242.htm#fr_300.md) Nûmam karma mâyâ vâ.
