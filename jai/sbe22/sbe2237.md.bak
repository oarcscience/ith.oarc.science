#### THIRD LESSON.

Some are awakened as middle-aged men and exert themselves well, having,
as clever men, heard and received the word of the learned <span
id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_264.md). The noble ones have impartially
preached the law. Those who are awakened, should not wish for pleasure,
nor do harm, nor desire (any forbidden things). A person who is without
desires and does no harm unto any living beings in the whole world, is
called by me 'unfettered.' (1)

One free from passions understands perfectly the bright one <span
id="fr_268"></span>[2](#fn_265.md), knowing birth in the upper and nether
regions.

'Bodies increase through nourishment, they are frail in hardships.' See
some whose organs are failing (give way to weakness).

A person who has no desires, cherishes pity. He who understands the
doctrine of sin, is a mendicant who knows the time, the strength, the
measure, the occasion, the conduct, the religious precept; he disowns
all things not requisite for religious purposes,

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

in time exerts himself, is under no obligations; he proceeds securely
(on the road to final liberation) after having cut off both (love and
hate) <span id="fr_269"></span>[1](sbe2238.htm#fn_266). (2.md)

A householder approaching a mendicant whose limbs tremble for cold, may
say:

O long-lived *S*rama*n*a! are you not subject to the influences of your
senses?

O long-lived householder! I am not subject to the influences of my
senses. But I cannot sustain the feeling of cold. Yet it does not become
me to kindle or light a fire <span
id="fr_270"></span>[2](sbe2238.htm#fn_267.md), that I may warm or heat
myself; nor (to procure that comfort) through the order of others.

Perhaps after the mendicant has spoken thus, the other kindles or lights
a fire that he may warm or heat himself. But the mendicant should well
observe and understand this, that he may order him to show no such
obsequiousness. Thus I say. (3)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_264"></span>[66:1](sbe2237.htm#fr_267.md) The scholiast says
that there are three classes of the awakened: the Svayambuddha, the
Pratyekabuddha, and the Buddhabodhita. The last only is treated of in
the text.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[66:2](sbe2237.htm#fr_268.md) I.e. self-control.
