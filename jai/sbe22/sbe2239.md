#### FIFTH LESSON.

A mendicant who is fitted out with two robes, and a bowl as third
(article), will not think: I shall beg for a third robe. He should beg
for robes which are allowed to be begged for; he should wear the
clothes, &c. &c. <span id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_274) This is the whole
outfit of one who wears clothes. But know further, that after the winter
is gone and the hot season has come, one should leave off the used-up
garments; having left off the used-up garments, (one should) be clad
with the undermost garment, with a gown <span
id="fr_278"></span>[2](#fn_275), or with no clothes at all--aspiring to
freedom from bonds. Penance suits him. Knowing what the Revered One has
declared, one should thoroughly and in all respects conform to it. (1)

When the thought occurs to a mendicant that through illness he is too
weak, and not able to beg from house to house--and on his thus
complaining a householder brings food, &c., obtained (without injuring
life <span id="fr_279"></span>[3](#fn_276)), and gives it him--then he
should, after deliberation, say <span id="fr_280"></span>[4](#fn_277): O
long-lived householder! it does not become me to eat or drink this <span
id="fr_281"></span>[3](#fn_276) food, &c., or (accept) anything else of
the same kind. (2)

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

A mendicant who has resolved, that he will, when sick, accept the
assistance of fellow-ascetics <span id="fr_282"></span>[1](#fn_278) in
good health, when they offer (assistance) without being asked, and that
vice versa he, when in health, will give assistance to sick
fellow-ascetics, offering it without being asked--(he should not deviate
from his resolution though he die for want of help). (3)

Taking the vow to beg (food, &c.) for another (who is sick), and to eat
(when sick) what is brought by another; taking the vow to beg, &c., and
not to eat what is brought; taking the vow not to beg, &c., but to eat
what is brought; taking the vow neither to beg, &c., nor to eat what is
brought--(one should adhere to that vow). Practising thus the law as it
has been declared, one becomes tranquil, averted from sin, guarded
against the allurements of the senses. Even thus (though sick) he will
in due time put an end to existence <span
id="fr_283"></span>[2](#fn_279). This (method) has been adopted by many
who were free from delusion; it is good, wholesome, proper, beatifying,
meritorious. Thus I say. (4)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_274"></span>[69:1](sbe2239.htm#fr_277) See lesson 4, § 1.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[69:2](sbe2239.htm#fr_278) The MSS. are at
variance with each other in adapting the words of the former lesson to
the present case. As the commentaries are no check, and do not explain
our passage, I have selected what seemed to me to be the most likely
reading.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[69:3](sbe2239.htm#fr_281) Abhiha*d*a =
abhyâh*ri*ta: it is a typical attribute of objectionable things. The
commentator explains it here by *g*îvopamardaniv*ri*tta.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[69:4](sbe2239.htm#fr_280) The original has
only âloe*gg*â, he should examine whether <span id="page_70">p.
70</span> the food &c. is acceptable or not. This is called the
graha*n*aisha*n*â.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[70:1](sbe2239.htm#fr_282) Sâhammiya =
sâdharmika, one who follows the same rule in cases where different rules
are left to the option of the mendicants. The word abhika*m*kha =
abhikâṅkshya is not translated, the commentator makes it out to mean,
wishing for freedom from sinful acts.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[70:2](sbe2239.htm#fr_283) As in the preceding
lesson a man who cannot conquer his sensuality, is permitted to commit
suicide (by hanging himself, &c.), in order to put an end to his trials
and temptations, so in this lesson a man whose sickness prevents him
from persevering in a life of austerities, is permitted to commit
suicide by rejecting food and drink. This is called
bhaktapânapratyâkhyânamukti. It seems therefore to have been regarded as
leading to final liberation (mukti).
