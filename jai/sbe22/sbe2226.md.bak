### THIRD LESSON.

Many are not attached to something in this world, they are not attached
to it among these (householders). He is a wise man who has heard and
understood the word of the learned ones. Without partiality the law has
been declared by the noble ones. As I have destroyed here <span
id="fr_207"></span>[1](#fn_204.md) the connection with the world, so is the
connection elsewhere difficult to destroy. Therefore I say: One should
not abandon firmness. (1) Some who early exert themselves, do not
afterwards slide back; some who early exert themselves, afterwards slide
back; those who do not early exert themselves, (can of course) not slide
back. That man also is of this description <span
id="fr_208"></span>[2](#fn_205.md), who knowing the world (as worthless
nevertheless) follows its ways. 'Knowing this, it has been declared by
the sage.' Here the follower of the commandment,

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

the wise, the passionless, he who exerts himself before morning and
after evening <span id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_206.md), always
contemplating virtue <span id="fr_210"></span>[2](#fn_207.md) and hearing
(the merit of it) will become free from love and delusion. 'Fight with
this (your body)! why should you fight with anything else?' Difficult to
attain is this (human body) which is worth the fight. For the clever
ones have praised the discernment of wisdom; the fool who falls from it,
is liable to birth, &c. (2) In this (religion of the *G*ainas the cause
of the fool's fall) has been declared (to depend) on colour <span
id="fr_211"></span>[3](#fn_208.md) and killing. But a sage who walks the
beaten track (to liberation), regards the world in a different way.
'Knowing thus (the nature of) acts in all regards, he does not kill,' he
controls himself, he is not overbearing. (3)

Comprehending that pleasure (and pain) are individual, advising
kindness, he will not engage in any work in the whole world: keeping
before him the one (great aim, liberation), and not turning aside,
'living humbly, unattached to any creature.' The rich (in control) who
with a mind endowed with all penetration (recognises) that a bad deed
should not be done, will not go after it. What you acknowledge as
righteousness, that you acknowledge as sagedom (mauna); what you
acknowledge as sagedom, that you acknowledge as righteousness. It is

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

inconsistent with weak, sinning, sensual, ill-conducted house-inhabiting
men. (4) 'A sage, acquiring sagedom, should subdue his body.' 'The
heroes who look at everything with indifference, use mean and rough
(food, &c.)' Such a man is said to have crossed the flood (of life), to
be a sage, to have passed over (the sa*m*sâra), to be liberated, to have
ceased (from acts). Thus I say. (5)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_204"></span>[45:1](sbe2226.htm#fr_207.md) 'Here' and
'elsewhere' mean, in the church of Mahâvîra, and in that of the
Tîrthikas.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[45:2](sbe2226.htm#fr_208.md) Belongs to the last
category, to which belong the *S*âkyas, &c.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[46:1](sbe2226.htm#fr_209.md) Puvvâvararâya*m*,
the first and the last wake (yâma) of the night; the intermediate time
is allowed for sleep.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[46:2](sbe2226.htm#fr_210.md) Sîla is either
sa*m*yama, control with its 18,000 subdivisions, or it consists of (1)
the five great vows, (2) the three guptis, (3) the restraint of the
senses, (4) the avoidance of sin (kashâya).

<span id="fn_208"></span>[46:3](sbe2226.htm#fr_211.md) Colour stands for
all perceptions of the senses. Of course, the attachment to sensual
pleasures is meant.
