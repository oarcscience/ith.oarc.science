#### Life of Mahâvîra, Lecture 4

When the Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ, having seen these fourteen
illustrious, great dreams, awoke, she was glad, pleased, and joyful, &c.
(see § 5, down to) rose from her couch, and descended from the
footstool. Neither hasty nor trembling, with a quick and even

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

gait like that of the royal swan, she went to the couch of the Kshatriya
Siddhârtha. There she awakened the Kshatriya Siddhârtha, addressing him
with kind, pleasing, amiable, tender, illustrious, beautiful, lucky,
blest, auspicious, fortunate, heart-going, heart-easing, well-measured,
sweet, and soft words. (47)

Then the Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ, with the permission of king
Siddhârtha, sat down on a chair of state inlaid with various jewels and
precious stones in the form of arabesques; calm and composed, sitting on
an excellent, comfortable chair, she addressed him with kind, pleasing,
&c. (see last paragraph), words, and spoke thus: (48)

'O beloved of the gods, I was just now on my couch (as described in §
32), &c. (see § 5), and awoke after having seen the fourteen dreams; to
wit, an elephant, &c. What, to be sure, O my lord, will be the happy
result portended by these fourteen illustrious, great dreams?' (49)

When the Kshatriya Siddhârtha had heard and perceived this news from the
Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ, he glad, pleased, and joyful, &c. (see § 5,
down to) firmly fixed the dreams in his mind, and entered upon
considering them; he grasped the meaning of those dreams with his own
innate intelligence and intuition which were preceded by reflection, and
addressing the Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ with kind, pleasing, &c., words,
spoke thus: (50)

'O beloved of the gods, you have seen illustrious dreams, &c. (see § 9,
down to) you will give birth to a lovely, handsome boy, who will be the
ensign of our family, the lamp of our family, the crown <span
id="fr_586"></span>[1](#fn_579.md) of our family, the frontal ornament

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

of our family, the maker of our family's glory, the sun of our family,
the stay of our family, the maker of our family's joy and fame, the tree
of our family, the exalter of our family; (a boy) with tender hands and
feet, &c. (see § 9, down to the end). (51) And this boy, after having
passed childhood, and, with just ripened intellect, having reached the
state of youth, will become a brave, gallant, and valorous king, the
lord of the realm, with a large and extensive army and train of waggons.
(52) Therefore, O beloved of the gods, you have seen illustrious, &c.,
dreams, &c. (see § 9).'

In this way he repeatedly expressed his extreme satisfaction.

When the Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ had heard and perceived this news from
king Siddhârtha, she glad, pleased, and joyful, &c. (see § 12, down to)
and spoke thus: (53)

'That is so, O beloved of the gods, &c. (see § 13, down to) as you have
pronounced it.'

Thus saying she accepted the true meaning of the dreams, and with the
permission of king Siddhârtha she rose from her chair of state, inlaid
with various jewels and precious stones in the form of arabesques. She
then returned to her own bed, neither hasty nor trembling, with a quick
and even gait like that of the royal swan, and spoke thus: (54)

'These my excellent and pre-eminent dreams shall not be counteracted by
other bad dreams.'

Accordingly she remained awake to save her dreams by means of (hearing)
good, auspicious, pious, agreeable stories about gods and religious men.
(55)

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

At the time of daybreak the Kshatriya Siddhârtha called his family
servants and spoke thus: (56)

Now, beloved of the gods, quickly make ready, or have made ready, the
exterior hall of audience; see that it be sprinkled with scented water,
cleaned, swept, and newly smeared, furnished with offerings of fragrant,
excellent flowers of all five colours, made highly delightful through
curling scented fumes, &c. (see § 32, down to) and turned, as it were,
into a smelling box; also erect my throne, and having done this quickly
return, and report on the execution of my orders.' (57)

When the family servants were thus spoken to by king Siddhârtha,
they--glad, pleased, and joyful, &c. (see § 12, down to) on their heads,
and modestly accepted the words of command, saying, 'Yes, master!' Then
they left the presence of the Kshatriya Siddhârtha, and went to the
exterior hall of audience, made it ready, and erected the throne (as
described in the last paragraph). Having done this, they returned to the
Kshatriya Siddhârtha; joining the palms of their hands so as to bring
the ten nails together, laid the folded hands on their heads, and
reported on the execution of their orders. (58)

Early at the wane of the night, when the bright morning disclosed the
soft flowers of the full-blown lotuses and Nymphaeas, rose the sun: he
was red like the A*s*oka, the open Ki*ms*uka, the bill of a parrot or
the Gu*ñg*ârdha; of an intense redness like that of the
Bandhu*g*îvaka <span id="fr_587"></span>[1](#fn_580.md), the feet and eyes
of the turtle dove, the scarlet eyes of the Indian cuckoo, a mass of
China roses, or vermilion. He, the thousand-rayed maker of the day,
shining in his radiance, awakened

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

the groups of lotuses. When in due time the god of the day had risen and
by the blows of his hands (or rays) the darkness was driven away, while
the inhabited world was, as it were, dipped in saffron by the morning
sun, the Kshatriya Siddhârtha rose from his bed, (59) descended from the
footstool, went to the hall for gymnastic exercises, and entered it.
There he applied himself to many wholesome exercises, jumped, wrestled,
fenced, and fought till he got thoroughly tired: then he was anointed
with hundredfold and thousandfold refined different kinds of oil, which
nourished, beautified, invigorated, exhilarated, strengthened, and
increased all senses and limbs. On an oiled hide he was shampooed by
clever men with soft and tender palms of the hands and soles of the
feet, who were well acquainted with the best qualities of the practices
of anointing, kneading, and stretching; well trained, skilful,
excellent, expert, intelligent, and never tiring. When by this fourfold
agreeable treatment of the body the king's bones, flesh, skin, and hair
had been benefited, and his fatigues banished, he left the hall for
gymnastic exercises, (60) and entered the bathing-house. The pleasant
bathing-room was very agreeable, and contained many windows <span
id="fr_588"></span>[1](#fn_581.md) ornamented with pearls; its floor was
decorated with mosaic of various jewels and precious stones. On the
bathing-stool, inlaid with various jewels and precious stones in the
form of arabesques, he comfortably sat down and bathed himself with
water scented with flowers and perfumes, with tepid water and pure
water, according to an excellent method of

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

bathing, combined with healthy exercises. When this healthy excellent
bathing under many hundredfold pleasures was over, he dried his body
with a long-haired, soft, scented, and coloured towel, put on a new and
costly excellent robe, rubbed himself with fresh and fragrant
Go*s*îrsha <span id="fr_589"></span>[1](#fn_582.md) and sandal, and
ornamented himself with fine wreaths and sandal-ointment. He put on
(ornaments) of jewels and pearls, hung round his neck fitting necklaces
of eighteen, nine, and three strings of pearls, and one with a pearl
pendant, and adorned himself with a zone. He put on a collar, rings, and
charming ornaments of the hair, and encumbered his arms with excellent
bracelets: he was of excessive beauty. His face was lighted up by
earrings, and his head by a diadem; his breast was adorned and decked
with necklaces, and his fingers were, as it were, gilded by his rings.
His upper garment of fine cloth contained swinging pearl pendants. H e
put on, as an emblem of his undefeated knighthood, glittering,
well-made, strong, excellent, beautiful armlets, made by clever artists
of spotless and costly jewels, gold, and precious stones of many kinds.
In short, the king was like the tree granting all desires, decorated and
ornamented; an umbrella, hung with wreaths and garlands of Kori*nt*a
flowers, was held above him. He was fanned with white excellent
chowries, while his appearance was greeted with auspicious shouts of
victory. Surrounded by many chieftains, satraps, kings, princes,
knights, sheriffs, heads of families, ministers, chief ministers,
astrologers, counsellors, servants, dancing masters, citizens, traders,
merchants, foremen of guilds, generals, leaders of caravans,

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

messengers, and frontier-guards, he--the lord and chief of men, a bull
and a lion among men, shining with excellent lustre and glory, lovely to
behold like the moon emerging from a great white cloud in the midst of
the flock of the planets and of brilliant stars and asterisms--left the
bathing-house, (61) entered the exterior hall of audience and sat down
on his throne with the face towards the east. (62)

On the north-eastern side he ordered eight state chairs, covered with
cloth and auspiciously decorated with white mustard, to be set down. Not
too far from and not too near to himself; towards the interior of the
palace, he had a curtain drawn. It was adorned with different jewels and
precious stones, extremely worth seeing, very costly, and manufactured
in a famous town; its soft cloth was all over covered with hundreds of
patterns and decorated with pictures of wolves, bulls, horses, men,
dolphins, birds, snakes, Kinnaras, deer, *S*arabhas, Yaks, Sa*m*saktas,
elephants, shrubs, and plants. Behind it he ordered to be placed, for
the Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ, an excellent chair of state, decorated with
arabesques of different jewels and precious stones, outfitted with a
coverlet and a soft pillow, covered with a white cloth, very soft and
agreeable to the touch. Then he called the family servants and spoke
thus: (63)

'Quickly, O beloved of the gods, call the interpreters of dreams who
well know the science of prognostics with its eight branches, and are
well versed in many sciences besides!'

When the family servants were thus spoken to by king Siddhârtha,
they--glad, pleased, and joyful, &c.--laid the folded hands on their
heads and

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

modestly accepted the words of command, saying, 'Yes, master!' (64)

Then they left the presence of the Kshatriya Siddhârtha, went right
through the town Ku*nd*apura to the houses of the interpreters of
dreams, and called the interpreters of dreams. (65)

Then the interpreters of dreams, being called by the Kshatriya
Siddhârtha's family servants, glad, pleased, and joyful, &c., bathed,
made the offering (to the house-gods) <span
id="fr_590"></span>[1](#fn_583.md), performed auspicious rites and
expiatory <span id="fr_591"></span>[2](#fn_584.md) acts, put on excellent,
lucky, pure court-dress, adorned their persons with small but costly
ornaments, and put, for the sake of auspiciousness, white mustard and
Dûrvâ grass on their heads. Thus they issued from their own houses and
went right through the Kshatriya part of the town Ku*nd*apura to the
front gate of king Siddhârtha's excellent palace, a jewel of its kind.
(66)

There they assembled and went to the exterior hall of audience in the
presence of the Kshatriya Siddhârtha. Joining the palms of their hands
so as to bring the ten nails together, they laid the folded hands on
their heads and gave him the greeting of victory. (67)

The king Siddhârtha saluted and honoured the interpreters of dreams,
made them presents, and received them with respect. They sat down, one
after the other, on the chairs of state which had been placed there
before. (68) Then the Kshatriya Siddhârtha placed his wife Tri*s*alâ
behind the curtain, and taking flowers and fruits in his hands,

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

addressed with utmost courtesy the interpreters of dreams: (69)

'O beloved of the gods, the Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ was just on her
couch, &c. (see § 32, down to the end). (70 and 71) What to be sure, O
beloved of the gods, will be the result portended by these fourteen
illustrious great dreams?' (72)

When the interpreters of dreams had heard and perceived this news from
the Kshatriya Siddhârtha, they--glad, pleased, and joyful, &c.--fixed
the dreams in their minds, entered upon considering them, and conversed
together. (73)

Having found, grasped, discussed, decided upon, and clearly understood
the meaning of these dreams, they recited before king Siddhârtha the
dream-books and spoke thus:

'O beloved of the gods, in our dream-books are enumerated forty-two
(common) dreams and thirty great dreams. Now, O beloved of the gods, the
mothers of universal monarchs or of Arhats wake up after seeing these
fourteen great dreams out of the thirty great dreams, when the embryo of
a universal monarch or an Arhat enters their womb; (74) viz. an
elephant, a bull, &c. (75) The mothers of Vâsudevas wake up after seeing
any seven great dreams out of these fourteen great dreams, when the
embryo of a Vâsudeva enters their womb. (76) The mothers of Baladevas
wake up after seeing any four great dreams out of these fourteen great
dreams, when the embryo of a Baladeva enters their womb. (77) The mother
of Mâ*nd*alikas wake up after seeing a single great dream out of these
fourteen great dreams, when the embryo of a Mâ*nd*alika enters their
womb. (78) Now, O beloved

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

of the gods, the Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ has seen these fourteen great
dreams, &c. (see § 51, down to the end). (79) And this boy, &c. (see §
52, down to) the lord of a realm with a large and extensive army and
train of waggons, a universal emperor or a *G*ina, the lord of the three
worlds, the universal emperor of the law. (80). Therefore, O beloved of
the gods, the Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ has seen illustrious dreams,' &c.
(see § 9). (81)

When king Siddhârtha had heard and perceived this news from the
interpreter of dreams, he--glad, pleased, and joyful, &c.--spoke to them
thus: (82)

That is so, O beloved of the gods, &c. (see § 11, down to) as you have
pronounced it.'

Thus saying he accepted the true meaning of the dreams, and honoured the
interpreters of dreams with praise and plenty of food, flowers,
perfumes, garlands, and ornaments. He made them a present in keeping
with their station in life <span id="fr_592"></span>[1](#fn_585.md) and
dismissed them. (83)

After this the Kshatriya Siddhârtha rose from his throne, went to the
Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ behind the curtain, and addressed her thus: (84)

Now, O beloved of the gods, you have seen these fourteen great dreams,
&c. (see §§ 79, 80, down to) emperor of the law.' (85, 86) When the
Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ had heard and perceived this news, she--glad,
pleased, and joyful, &c.--accepted the true meaning of the dreams. (87)
With the permission of king Siddhârtha she rose from her chair of state
which was decorated with arabesques of various jewels and precious
stones,

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

and returned to her own apartments, neither hasty nor trembling, with a
quick and even gait like that of the royal swan. (88)

From that moment in which the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra was brought
into the family of the G*ñ*ât*ri*s, many demons <span
id="fr_593"></span>[1](#fn_586.md) in Vai*s*rama*n*a's service, belonging
to the animal world, brought, on *S*akra's command, to the palace of
king Siddhârtha, old and ancient treasures, of which the owners,
deponers, and families to whom they originally belonged were dead and
extinct, and which were hidden in villages, or mines, or scot-free
towns, or towns with earth walls, or towns with low walls, or isolated
towns, or towns accessible by land and water, or towns accessible either
by land or by water only, or in natural strongholds, or in
halting-places for processions or for caravans, in triangular places, or
in places where three or four roads meet, or in courtyards, or squares,
or high roads, or on the site of villages or towns, or in drains of
villages or towns, or in bazaars, or temples, or assembling halls, or
wells, or parks, or gardens, or woods, or groves, or burying-places, or
empty houses, or mountain caves, or hermits' cells, or secret places
between walls, or in houses on an elevation, or houses for audience, or
palaces. (89)

In the night in which the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra was brought into
the family of the *Gñ*ât*ri*s their silver increased, their gold
increased; their riches, corn, majesty, and kingdom increased; their
army, train, treasure, storehouse, town, seraglio, subjects, and glory
increased; their real valuable property, as riches, gold, precious
stones, jewels,

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

pearls, conches, stones, corals, rubies, &c., the intensity of their
popularity and liberality highly increased. At that time the following
personal, reflectional, desirable idea occurred to parents of the
Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra: (90)

From the moment that this our boy has been begotten, our silver
increased, our gold increased, &c. (see § 90, down to) the intensity of
our liberality and popularity highly increased. Therefore when this our
boy will be born, we shall give him the fit name, attributive and
conformable to his quality--Vardhamâna <span
id="fr_594"></span>[1](#fn_587).' (91.md)

Now the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, out of compassion for his mother,
did not move nor stir nor quiver, but remained quiet, stiff, and
motionless. Then the following, &c. (see § 90, down to) idea occurred to
the mind of the Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ: 'The fruit of my womb has been
taken from me, it has died, it is fallen, it is lost. Formerly it moved,
now it does not move.' Thus with anxious thoughts and ideas, plunged in
a sea of sorrow and misery, reposing her head on her hand, overcome by
painful reflections, and casting her eyes on the ground she meditated.
And in the palace of king Siddhârtha the music of drums and stringed
instruments, the clapping of hands, the dramatical performances, and the
amusements of the people ceased, and mournful dejection reigned there.
(92)

Then the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, knowing that such an internal, &c.
(see § 90, down to) idea had occurred to the mind of his mother, he
quivered a little. (93)

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

Feeling her child quivering, trembling, moving, and stirring, the
Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ--glad, pleased, and joyful, &c.--spoke thus:
'No, forsooth, the fruit of my womb has not been taken from me, it has
not died, it is not fallen, it is not lost. Formerly it did not move,
but now it does move.' Thus she was glad, pleased, and joyful, &c.

Then the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, while in her womb, formed the
following resolution: 'It will not behove me, during the life of my
parents, to tear out my hair, and leaving the house to enter the state
of houselessness.' (94)

Bathing, making offerings to the house-gods, performing auspicious rites
and expiatory acts, and adorning herself with all ornaments, the
Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ kept off sickness, sorrow, fainting, fear, and
fatigue by food and clothing, perfumes and garlands, which were not too
cold nor too hot, not too bitter nor too pungent, not too astringent nor
too sour nor too sweet, not too smooth nor too rough, not too wet nor
too dry, but all just suiting the season. In the proper place and time
she ate only such food which was good, sufficient, and healthy for the
nourishment of her child. She took her walks in places which were empty
and agreeable as well as delightful to the mind; her desires were
laudable, fulfilled, honoured, not disregarded, but complied with and
executed; she most comfortably dozed, reposed, remained, sat, and laid
on unobjectionable and soft beds and seats, and thus most comfortably
carried her unborn child. (95)

In that period, in that age the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra <span
id="fr_595"></span>[1](#fn_588.md)--after the lapse of nine months and

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

seven and a half days, in the first month of summer, in the second
fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of *K*aitra, on its fourteenth day,
\[while all planets were in their exaltations, the moon in her principal
conjunction, and the sky in all its directions clear, bright, and pure;
while a favourable and agreeable low wind swept the earth; at the time
when the fields were green and all people glad and amusing
themselves\] <span id="fr_596"></span>[1](#fn_589.md) in the middle of the
night while the moon was in conjunction with the asterism
Uttaraphalgunî--(Tri*s*alâ), perfectly healthy herself, gave birth to a
perfectly healthy boy. (96) <span id="fr_597"></span>[2](#fn_590.md)
