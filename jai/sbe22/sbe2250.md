#### FOURTH LESSON.

A monk or a nun on a begging-tour should not resolve to go to a
festival, preceded or followed by an entertainment, to partake of it,
when they know that there will be served up chiefly meat or fish or
roasted slices of meat or fish; nor to a wedding breakfast in the
husband's house or in that of the bride's father; nor to a funeral
dinner or to a family dinner where something is served up,--if on their
way there, there are many living beings, many seeds, many sprouts, much
dew, much water, much mildew, many drops (of water), much dust, and many
cobwebs; or if there have arrived or will arrive many *S*rama*n*as and
Brâhma*n*as, guests, paupers, and beggars, and if it will be a crowded
assembly, so that a wise man may not enter or leave it, or learn there
the sacred texts, to question about them, to repeat them, to consider
them, to think about the substance of the law. (1)

A monk or a nun may go to such an entertainment (as described in the
preceding Sara), provided that on their way there, there are few living
beings, few seeds, &c.; that no *S*rama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as, &c., have
arrived or will arrive; that it is not a

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

crowded assembly, so that a wise man may enter or leave, &c. <span
id="fr_342"></span>[1](#fn_336) (2)

A monk or a nun desirous to enter the abode of a householder, should not
do so, when they see that the milch cows are being milked, or the food,
&c., is being cooked, and that it is not yet distributed. Perceiving
this, they should step apart and stay where no people pass or see them.
But when they conceive that the milch cows are milked, the dinner
prepared and distributed, then they may circumspectly enter or leave the
householder's abode for the sake of alms. (3)

Some of the mendicants say to those who follow the same rules of
conduct, live (in the same place), or wander from village to village:
'This is indeed a small village, it is too populous, nor is it large;
reverend gentlemen, go to the outlying villages to beg alms <span
id="fr_343"></span>[2](#fn_337).'

Some mendicant may have there kinsmen or relations, e. g. a householder
or his wife, or daughters, or daughters-in-law, or nurses, or male and
female slaves or servants. Such families with which he is connected by
kindred or through marriage, he intends to visit before (the time of
begging): 'I shall get there (he thinks) food or dainties or milk or
thick sour milk or fresh butter or ghee or sugar or oil or honey or meat
or liquor, a sesamum dish <span id="fr_344"></span>[3](#fn_338), or raw
sugar, or a meal of parched wheat <span id="fr_345"></span>[4](#fn_339),
or a meal of curds and sugar with spices <span
id="fr_346"></span>[5](#fn_340); after having eaten and drunk, and
having cleaned and rubbed the alms-bowl, I shall,

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

together with other mendicants, enter or leave the abode of a
householder to collect alms.' As this would be sinful, he should not do
so. (4)

But, at the proper time, entering there with the other mendicants, he
may there in these or other families accept alms which are acceptable
and given out of respect for his cloth, and eat his meal.

This certainly is the whole duty, &c. (see end of lesson 1).

Thus I say. (5)
