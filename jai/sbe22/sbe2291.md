### RULES FOR YATIS <span id="fr_682"></span>[1](#fn_675.md).

1\. In that period, in that age the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra commenced
the Pa*gg*usan when a month and twenty nights of the rainy season had
elapsed.

Why has it been said that the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra commenced the
Pa*gg*usan when a month and twenty nights of the rainy season had
elapsed?' (1)

'Because at that time the lay people have usually matted their houses,
whitewashed them, strewn them (with straw), smeared them (with cowdung),
levelled, smoothed, or perfumed them (or the floor of them), have dug
gutters and drains, have furnished their houses, have rendered them
comfortable, and have cleaned them. Hence it has been said that the
Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra commenced the Pa*gg*usan when a month and
twenty nights of the rainy season had elapsed.' (2)

As the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra commenced the Pa*gg*usan when a month
and twenty nights of the rainy season had elapsed, so the Ga*n*adharas
commenced the Pa*gg*usan when a month and twenty nights of the rainy
season had elapsed. (3) As the Ga*n*adharas have done, so the disciples
of the Ga*n*adharas have done. (4) As they have done,

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

so the Sthaviras have done. (5) As they have done, so do the Nirgrantha
*S*rama*n*as of the present time. (6)

As they do, so our masters, teachers, &c. do. (7) As they do, so do we
commence the Pa*gg*usan after a month and twenty nights of the rainy
season have elapsed. It is allowed to commence the Pa*gg*usan earlier,
but not after that time. (8)

2\. Monks or nuns during the Pa*gg*usan are allowed to regard their
residence as extending a Yo*g*ana and a Kro*s*a all around, and to live
there for a moderate time. (9)

3\. During the Pa*gg*usan monks or nuns are allowed to go and return,
for the sake of collecting alms, not farther than a Yo*g*ana and a
Kro*s*a (from their lodgings). (10) If there is (in their way) an always
flowing river which always contains water, they are not allowed to
travel for a Yo*g*ana and a Kro*s*a. (11) But if the river is like the
Erâvatî near Ku*n*âlâ, such that it can be crossed by putting one foot
in the water and keeping the other in the air, there it is allowed to
travel for a Yo*g*ana and a Kro*s*a. (12) But where that is impossible,
it is not allowed to travel for a Yo*g*ana and a Kro*s*a. (13)

4\. During the Pa*gg*usan the Â*k*ârya will say, 'Give, Sir!' Then he is
allowed to give (food to a sick brother), but not to accept himself.
(14) If the Â*k*ârya says, 'Accept, Sir!' then he is allowed to accept
(food), but not to give. (15) If the Â*k*ârya says, 'Give, Sir! accept,
Sir!' then the patient is allowed to give and to accept (food). (16)

5\. Monks or nuns who are hale and healthy, and of a strong body, are
not allowed during the Pa*gg*usan frequently to take the following nine
drinks: milk,

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

thick sour milk, fresh butter, clarified butter, oil, sugar, honey,
liquor, and meat. (17)

6\. During the Pa*gg*usan a collector of alms might ask (the Â*k*ârya),
'Sir, is (anything of the just-mentioned articles) required for the sick
man?' he (the Â*k*ârya) says, 'Yes, it is.' Then (the sick man) should
be asked, 'How much do you require?' The Â*k*ârya says, 'So much is
required for the sick man: you must take so much as he told you.' And he
(the collector of alms) should beg, and begging he should accept (the
required food). Having obtained the quantity ordered, he should say, 'No
more!' Perchance (the giver of food) might ask, 'Why do you say so,
Sir?' (Then he should answer), 'Thus much is required for the sick man.'
Perchance, after that answer the other may say, 'Take it, Sir! You may
after (the sick man has got his share) eat it or drink it.' Thus he is
allowed to accept it, but he is not allowed to accept it by pretending
that it is for the sick man. (18)

7\. In householders' families which are converted, devoted, staunch
adherers (to the law), and honour, praise, and permit (the visits of
monks), Sthaviras, during the Pa*gg*usan, are not allowed to ask, 'Sir,
have you got such or such a thing?' if they do not see it.

'Why, Sir, has this been said?' 'Because a devout householder might buy
it or steal it.' (19)

8\. During the Pa*gg*usan a monk eats only one meal a day, and should at
one fixed <span id="fr_683"></span>[1](#fn_676.md) time frequent the abodes
of householders for the sake of collecting

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

alms, except when he does services for the Â*k*ârya, the teacher, an
ascetic, or a sick man, likewise if he or she be a novice who has not
yet the marks of ripe age <span id="fr_684"></span>[1](#fn_677). (20.md) To
a monk who during the Pa*gg*usan eats only one meal on every second day,
the following special rule applies. Having gone out in the morning, he
should eat and drink <span id="fr_685"></span>[2](#fn_678.md) his pure
dinner, then he should clean and rub his alms-bowl. If his dinner was
sufficient, he should rest content with it for that day; if not, he is
allowed for a second time to frequent the abodes of householders for the
sake of collecting alms. (21) A monk who during the Pa*gg*usan eats on
every third day, is allowed twice to frequent the abodes of householders
for the sake of collecting alms. (22) A monk who during the Pa*gg*usan
eats one meal on every fourth day, is allowed three times to frequent
the abodes of householders for the sake of collecting alms. (23) A monk
who keeps still more protracted fasts, is allowed at all (four) times to
frequent the abodes of householders for the sake of collecting alms.
(24)

9\. A monk who during the Pa*gg*usan eats one meal every day, is allowed
to accept all (permitted) drinks. A monk who during the Pa*gg*usan eats
one meal on every second day, is allowed to accept three kinds of
drinks: water used for watering flour, sesamum, or rice <span
id="fr_686"></span>[3](#fn_679.md). A monk who eats one meal

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

on every third day, is allowed to accept three kinds of drinks: water
used for washing sesamum, chaff, or barley <span
id="fr_687"></span>[1](#fn_680.md). A monk who during the Pa*gg*usan eats
one meal on every fourth day, is allowed to accept three kinds of water:
rain-water, or sour gruel, or pure (i.e. hot) water. A monk who during
the Pa*gg*usan keeps still more protracted fasts, is allowed to accept
only one kind of drink: hot pure water. It must contain no boiled
rice <span id="fr_688"></span>[2](#fn_681.md). A monk who abstains from
food altogether, is allowed to accept only one kind of drink: pure hot
water. It must contain no boiled rice; it must be filtered, not
unfiltered; it must be a limited quantity, not an unlimited one; it must
be sufficient, not insufficient. (25)

10\. A monk who during the Pa*gg*usan restricts himself to a certain
number of donations <span id="fr_689"></span>[3](#fn_682.md), is allowed to
accept (e. g.) five donations of food, and five of drink; or four of
food, and five of drink; or five of food, and four of drink. He may
accept one donation of salt for seasoning his meat <span
id="fr_690"></span>[4](#fn_683.md). He should

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

rest content for that day with the dinner he has brought together, and
is not allowed a second time to frequent the abodes of householders for
the sake of collecting alms. (26) During the Pa*gg*usan monks or nuns
who restrict their visits to certain houses may go to a place where rice
is cooked <span id="fr_691"></span>[1](#fn_684.md), if it is the seventh
house from that where they are lodged. According to some, the lodging is
included in the seven houses which such a mendicant must pass before he
may participate in the festive entertainment; but according to others,
it is not included in those seven houses. (27)

11\. During the Pa*gg*usan a monk who collects alms in the hollow of his
hand, is not allowed to frequent the abodes of householders, &c., if
rain <span id="fr_692"></span>[2](#fn_685.md), even in the form of a fine
spray, falls down. (28) During the Pa*gg*usan a monk who collects alms
in the hollow of his hand, is not allowed to stay anywhere except in a
house after having accepted alms, for it might begin to rain. But he
should eat a part, and put back the rest (if it then begins to rain),
covering his hand with the other hand, and laying it on his bosom or
hiding it under his armpit <span id="fr_693"></span>[3](#fn_686.md); then
he should go to well-covered (places), to a cave or the foot of a tree,
where no water or drops of water or spray of water falls in his hand.
(29)

12\. During the Pa*gg*usan a monk who collects

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

alms in the hollow of his hand, is not allowed to collect alms if rain,
even in the form of a fine spray, falls down. (30)

13\. During the Pa*gg*usan a monk who uses an alms-bowl is not allowed
to frequent the abodes of householders for the sake of collecting alms
if it rains fast, but he is allowed to do so if it rains but little; but
they must wear then an under and upper garment. (31) During the
Pa*gg*usan, a monk who has entered the abode of a householder while
there are single showers of rain, is allowed (when the rain ceases for a
moment) to stand under a grove, or in his residence, or in the
assembling-hall of the village <span id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_687.md), or
at the foot of a tree. (32) If before his arrival a dish of rice was
being cooked, and after it a dish of pulse was begun to be cooked, he is
allowed to accept of the dish of rice, but not of the dish of pulse.
(33) But if before his arrival a dish of pulse was being cooked, and
after it a dish of rice was begun to be cooked, he is allowed to accept
of the dish of pulse, but not of the dish of rice. (34) If both dishes
were begun to be cooked before his arrival, he is allowed to accept of
both. If both dishes were begun to be cooked after his arrival, he is
not allowed to accept of either. He is allowed to accept of what was
prepared before his arrival; he is not allowed to accept of what was
prepared after his arrival. (35) During the Pa*gg*usan, &c. (see § 32,
down to) tree; he is not allowed to pass there his time with the food he
had collected before. But he should first eat and drink his pure (food
and drink), then rub and clean his alms-bowl,

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

and, putting his things together, he should, while the sun has not yet
set, go to the place where he is lodged; but he is not allowed to pass
the night in the former place. (36) During the Pa*gg*usan, &c. (see §
32, down to) tree. (37) It is not allowed that there at the same place
should stand together one monk and one nun, nor one monk and two nuns,
nor two monks and one nun, nor two monks and two nuns. But if there is a
fifth person, a male or female novice, or if that place can be seen (by
those who pass) or doors open on it, then they are allowed to stand
there together. (38) During the Pa*gg*usan, &c. (see § 32, down to)
tree. It is not allowed that there at the same place should stand
together a monk and a lay woman, &c. (through the four cases as in §
28). But if there is a fifth person, a Sthavira or a Sthavirâ, or if
that place can be seen (by those who pass) or doors open on it, then
they are allowed to stand there together. The same rule applies to a nun
and a layman. (39)

14\. During the Pa*gg*usan monks or nuns are not allowed to accept food,
drink, dainties, and spices for one who has not asked them, and whom
they have not promised to do so. (40)

'Why has this been said, Sir?' 'Because one who collects alms for
another without being asked for it, might eat them or not, just as he
lists.' (41)

15\. During the Pa*gg*usan monks or nuns are not allowed to take their
meals as long as their body is wet or moist. (42)

'How has this been said, Sir?' 'Seven places which retain the moisture
have been declared: the hands, the lines in the hand, the nails, the top
of the nails, the brows, the under lip, the upper lip.'

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But when they
perceive that the water on their body has dried up and the moisture is
gone, then they are allowed to take their meals. (43)

16\. There are these eight classes of small things which a mendicant
ought diligently to perceive, observe, and inspect, viz. living beings,
mildew, seeds, sprouts, flowers, eggs, layers, and moisture.

What is understood by the small living beings? The small living beings
are declared to be of five kinds: black, blue, red, yellow, and white
ones. There is an animalcule called Anuddharî, which when at rest and
not moving is not easily seen by monks and nuns who have not yet reached
perfection, which when not at rest but moving is easily seen by monks
and nuns who have not yet reached perfection. Monks and nuns who have
not yet reached perfection must diligently perceive, observe, and
inspect this. Those are the small living beings. (44)

What is understood by small mildew? Small mildew has been declared to be
of five kinds: black, blue, &c. There is a kind of small mildew which
has the same colour as the substance on which it grows. Monks, nuns, &c.
(see § 44, down to) inspect this. That is small mildew.

What is understood by small seeds? Small seeds are declared to be of
five kinds: black, blue, &c. There is a kind of small seeds of the same
colour as grain <span id="fr_695"></span>[1](#fn_688.md). Monks and nuns,
&c. (see § 44, down to) inspect this. Those are the small seeds.

What is understood by small sprouts? Small sprouts are declared to be of
five kinds: black, blue, &c. There is a kind of small sprouts of

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

the same colour as earth. Monks and nuns, &c. (see § 44, down to)
inspect them. Those are the small sprouts.

What is understood by small flowers? Small flowers are declared to be of
five kinds: black, blue, &c. There is a kind of small flowers of the
same colour as the tree (on which they grow). Monks and nuns, &c. (see §
44, down to) inspect them. Those are the small flowers.

What is understood by small eggs? Small eggs are declared to be of five
kinds: eggs of biting insects <span id="fr_696"></span>[1](#fn_689.md), of
spiders, of ants, of lizards (or wasps) <span
id="fr_697"></span>[2](#fn_690.md), and of chameleons <span
id="fr_698"></span>[3](#fn_691). Monks and nuns, &c. (see § 44, down to.md)
inspect them. Those are the small eggs.

What is understood by small caves or lairs? Small caves or lairs are
declared to be of five kinds: lairs of animals of the asinine kind,
chasms, holes, cavities widening below like the stem of a palm tree, and
wasps' nests. Monks and nuns, &c. (see § 44, down to) inspect them.
Those are the small caves or lairs.

What is understood by small moisture? Small moisture is declared to be
of five kinds: dew, hoarfrost <span id="fr_699"></span>[4](#fn_692.md),
fog, hailstones, and damps. Monks and nuns,

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> &c. (see § 44,
down to) inspect this. That is small moisture. (45)

17\. During the Pa*gg*usan <span id="fr_700"></span>[1](#fn_693.md) a monk
might wish to frequent the abodes of householders for the sake of
collecting alms. He is not allowed to go without asking leave of the
teacher, or sub-teacher, or religious guide, or Sthavira, or head of the
Ga*n*a, or Ga*n*adhara, or founder of the Ga*n*a, or whom else he
regards as his superior; he is allowed to go after having asked leave of
one of these persons (in this way): 'I want with your permission to
frequent the abodes of householders for the sake of collecting alms.' If
he (the superior) grants permission, one is allowed to go; if not, one
is not allowed to go.

'Why has this been said, Sir?' 'The teacher knows how to make good what
has been done wrong.' (46) The same rule applies concerning the visits
to temples and leaving the house for easing nature <span
id="fr_701"></span>[2](#fn_694.md), or any other business, also the
wandering from village to village. (47)

18\. During the Pa*gg*usan a monk might wish to take some medicine; he
is not allowed to take it without asking leave of the teacher, &c. (see
§ 47, down to) founder of the Ga*n*a; but he is allowed to take it after
having asked leave of one of these persons (in this way): 'I want, Sir,
with your permission to take some medicine,' viz. so much or so often.
If he, &c. (see § 46, down to) wrong. (48)

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The same rule
applies if a monk wants to undergo some medical cure. (49) Also if he
wants to do some exalted penance. (50) Also if he intends, after the
last mortification of the flesh which is to end in death, to wait for
his last hour without desiring it, in total abstinence from food and
drink or in remaining motionless; also if he wants to go out or to
enter, to eat food, &c., to ease nature, to learn his daily lesson, to
keep religious vigils--he is not allowed to do it without asking leave.
(51)

19\. If during the Pa*gg*usan a monk wants to dry or warm (in the sun)
his robe, alms-bowl, blanket, broom, or any other utensil, he is not
allowed without asking one or many persons to frequent the abodes of
householders for the sake of collecting alms, to eat food, &c., to visit
temples or leave the house for easing nature, to learn his daily lesson,
to lie down with outstretched limbs or stand in some posture. If there
is somebody near, one or many persons, then he should say: 'Sir, please
mind this (robe, &c.) while I frequent the abodes of householders, &c.
(see above, down to) posture.' If that person promises to do it, then he
(the monk) is allowed to go; if he does not promise it, then he is not
allowed to go. (52)

20\. During the Pa*gg*usan monks or nuns are not allowed to be without
their proper bed or bench <span id="fr_702"></span>[1](#fn_695.md). This is
the reason: A mendicant whose bed and bench are not reserved for his own
use, are low and rickety, not sufficiently fastened, without a fixed
place, and never exposed to the sun, and

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

who is not circumspect in what he does, nor accustomed to inspect and
clean the things of his use, will find it difficult to exercise control;
(53) but on the contrary, control will be easy to him. (54)

21\. During the Pa*gg*usan monks or nuns must always inspect three spots
where to ease nature; not so in the summer and winter, as in the rainy
season. 'Why has this been said, Sir?' 'For in the rainy season living
beings, grass, seeds, mildew, and sprouts frequently come forth.' (55)

22\. During the Pa*gg*usan monks or nuns must have three pots, one for
ordure, one for urine, and a spitting-box. (56) Monks and nuns, who wear
after the Pa*gg*usan their hair as short as that of a cow, are not
allowed to do so during the Pa*gg*usan after that night (of the fifth
Bhâdrapada); but a monk should shave his head or pluck out his
hair <span id="fr_703"></span>[1](#fn_696.md). Shaving with a razor every
month, cutting with scissors every half-month, plucking out every six
months. (57) This is the conduct chiefly of Sthaviras during the rainy
season <span id="fr_704"></span>[2](#fn_697.md).

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

23\. During the Pa*gg*usan monks or nuns should not use harsh words
after the commencement of the Pa*gg*usan; if they do, they should be
warned Reverend brother (or sister), you speak unmannerly.' One who
(nevertheless) uses harsh words after the commencement of the
Pa*gg*usan, should be excluded from the community. (58)

24\. If, during the Pa*gg*usan, among monks or nuns occurs a quarrel or
dispute or dissension, the young monk should ask forgiveness of the
superior, and the superior of the young monk. They should forgive and
ask forgiveness, appease and be appeased, and converse without
restraint <span id="fr_705"></span>[1](#fn_698.md). For him who is
appeased, there will be success (in control); for him who is not
appeased, there will be no success; therefore one should appease one's
self. 'Why has this been said, Sir?' 'Peace is the essence of
monachism.' (59)

25\. During the Pa*gg*usan monks or nuns should have three
lodging-places; (two) for occasional use,

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

which must be inspected; one for constant use, which must be swept <span
id="fr_706"></span>[1](#fn_699). (60.md)

26\. During the Pa*gg*usan monks or nuns should give notice of the
direction or intermediate direction in which they intend to go forth for
the sake of begging alms. 'Why has this been said, Sir?' 'During the
Pa*gg*usan the reverend monks frequently undertake austerities; an
ascetic becoming weak and exhausted might swoon or fall down. (In case
of such an accident the remaining) reverend monks will undertake their
search in that direction or intermediate direction (which the ascetic
had named them). (61)

27\. During the Pa*gg*usan monks or nuns are not allowed to travel
farther than four or five Yo*g*anas <span
id="fr_707"></span>[2](#fn_700.md), and then to return. They are allowed to
stay in some intermediate place, but not to pass there (at the end of
their journey) the night. (62)

Of those Nirgrantha monks who follow, &c. (see Â*k*ârâṅga Sûtra II, 15,
v end, down to) . . . . these (rules regulating) the conduct of
Sthaviras in the rainy season, some will reach perfection, &c. (see §
124, down to) be freed from all pains in that same life, some in the
next life, some in the third birth;

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

none will have to undergo more than seven or eight births. (63)

In that period, in that age the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, in the town
of Râ*g*ag*ri*ha, in the *K*aitya Gu*n*a*s*ilaka, surrounded by many
monks and nuns, by many men and women of the laity, by many gods and
goddesses, said thus, spoke thus, declared thus, explained thus; he
proclaimed again and again the Lecture called Paryusha*n*âkalpa with its
application, with its argumentation, with its information, with its
text, with its meaning, with both text and meaning, with the examination
of the meaning.

Thus I say. (64)

Sûtra II, I, 7, § 7. The definitions given in our commentary are the
following: the first is water mixed with flour, or water used for
washing the hands after kneading flour; the <span id="page_300">p.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[300:2](sbe2291.htm#fr_688.md) The commentator
says that the body of monks who fast longer than four days is usually
inhabited by a deity; this seems to denote, in our language, mental
derangement as a consequence of starving oneself.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[300:3](sbe2291.htm#fr_689.md) Datti. The
commentator does not explain this word. It seems to denote the quantity
of food or drink which is given by one man.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[300:4](sbe2291.htm#fr_690.md) The one donation of
salt is meant to make up the five donations to which the monk confines
himself. But he should not reckon <span id="page_301">p. 301</span> the
donations of food above the fixed number as donations of drink if the
latter have not yet reached the fixed number.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[301:3](sbe2291.htm#fr_693.md) To render kaksha.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[302:1](sbe2291.htm#fr_694.md) Vika*t*ag*ri*ha.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[304:1](sbe2291.htm#fr_695.md) Ka*n*ikâ.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[305:1](sbe2291.htm#fr_696.md) Udda*ms*a,
mosquitoes, gadflies, bugs.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[305:2](sbe2291.htm#fr_697.md) Halikâ, explained
by g*ri*hakokila, which I take to mean the same as g*ri*hagolikâ, a kind
of lizard; and vrâhma*n*î, a kind of wasps, ditto, of lizards.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[305:3](sbe2291.htm#fr_698.md) Hallohaliyâ, which
is declared by the commentator to be synonymous with ahilo*d*î,
sara*d*î, and kakki*nd*î. Of these words only sara*d*î is known; for it
seems to be the same with Sanskrit sara*t*a or sara*t*u, 'chameleon,
lizard,' and Marâthî sara*t*a, 'hedge-lizard.'

<span id="fn_692"></span>[305:4](sbe2291.htm#fr_699.md) Hima*h*
styânodaka*h*.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[306:1](sbe2291.htm#fr_700.md) The whole of the
seventeenth rule holds good not only for the rainy season, but also for
the rest of the year (*ri*tubaddhakâla).

<span id="fn_694"></span>[306:2](sbe2291.htm#fr_701.md) Vihârabhûmi and
vi*k*ârabhûmi, which in the Â*k*ârâṅga Sûtra I have, according to the
explanation of the commentary, translated places for study and religious
practices.'

<span id="fn_695"></span>[307:1](sbe2291.htm#fr_702.md) The commentator
translates pî*th*a, 'stool,' and phalaka, 'bench;' they are of course
not the property of the mendicant, but only temporally reserved for his
use.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[308:1](sbe2291.htm#fr_703.md) After these words
the text has pakkhiyâ ârova*n*â, which is explained in two ways: 1.
every half-month the tied strings on the bed should be untied and
inspected; the same should be done with wicker-work (? davaraka; cf.
Hindî daurâ, 'basket'); 2. every half-month prâya*sk*itta should be
made. The commentator Samayasundara says that "these words are not
connected with the preceding and following ones; their import
(paramârtha) should be learned from a well-instructed brother
(gîtârtha). I think that pakkhiyâ is not connected with paksha,
'half-month,' but with ke*s*apaksha, 'braid of hair, tresses;' the two
words, or rather the compound, would in that case denote arrangement of
(or in) tresses or braids, and relate to nuns who do not, as far as I
know, shave their head. A precept for nuns is just what would be
expected at this place, after one for monks (ârya) has been given.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[308:2](sbe2291.htm#fr_704.md) The last words are
variously interpreted by the commentators. <span id="page_309">p.
309</span> Therakappa is said to mean 'old monks,' for young and strong
ones must pluck out their hair every four months. It usually denotes the
conduct of ordinary monks, in opposition to the *G*i*n*akappa; if taken
in this sense, the whole passage is made out to mean that even one who,
because of sickness of hiss scalp, is dispensed from tearing out his
hair, must do it in the rainy season, for then the precept is binding
both for *G*inakalpikas and Sthavirakalpikas. According to the
interpretation I have followed the words sa*m*va*kkh*arie vâ therakappe
are a sort of colophon to the rules 17-22, and indicate that these rules
apply to Sthavirakalpikas, but not exclusively (vâ), as some apply to
*G*inakalpikas also. The phrase sa*m*va*kkh*ariya therakappa occurs also
at the beginning of § 62, and has there a similar meaning.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[309:1](sbe2291.htm#fr_705.md) According to the
commentary, they should ask each other the meaning of the Sûtras.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[310:1](sbe2291.htm#fr_706.md) I deviate from the
interpretation of the commentators, who give veuvviyâ (or veu*tt*iyâ v.
l.), which I have rendered for occasional use,' the sense of
repeatedly.' But as they give sâi*gg*iya the meaning 'used,' and as the
practice justifies my translation, I am rather confident about the
correctness of my conjecture. The practice, as related by the
commentator, is this: The Upâ*s*raya where the monks live must be swept
in the morning, when the monks go out begging, at noon, and in the
afternoon at the end of the third prahara; the other two Upâ*s*rayas
must be daily inspected, lest somebody else occupy them, and be swept
every third day.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[310:2](sbe2291.htm#fr_707.md) And this only in
case of need, to fetch medicine, &c, In ordinary cases the third rule
applies.
