## SECOND PART.

# THE SEVEN LECTURES <span id="fr_458"></span>[1](#fn_452.md).

### EIGHTH LECTURE <span id="fr_459"></span>[2](#fn_453.md).

When a monk or a nun wishes to perform religious postures <span
id="fr_460"></span>[3](#fn_454.md), they should enter a village or a
scot-free town, &c.; having entered it, they should not accept a place,
even if it is offered, which is infected by eggs or living beings, &c.;
for such a place is impure and unacceptable. In this way all that has
been said about couches (in the Second Lecture) should be repeated here
as far as 'water-plants' (II, 2, 1, § 5). (1)

Avoiding these occasions to sin, a mendicant may choose one of these
four rules for the performance of religious postures.

This is the first rule:

I shall choose something inanimate <span
id="fr_461"></span>[4](#fn_455.md), and lean against it; changing the
position of the body, and moving about a little, I shall stand there.

This is the first rule. (2)

Now follows the second rule:

I shall choose something inanimate, and lean

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

against it; changing the position of the body, but not moving about a
little, I shall stand there. This is the second rule. (3)

Now follows the third rule:

I shall choose something inanimate, and lean against it; not changing
the position of the body, nor moving about a little, I shall stand
there.

This is the third rule. (4)

Now follows the fourth rule:

I shall choose something inanimate, but I shall not lean against it; not
changing the position of the body, nor moving about a little, I shall
stand there. Abandoning the care of the body, abandoning the care of the
hair of the head, beard, and the other parts of the body, of the nails,
perfectly motionless, I shall stand there.

This is the fourth rule. (5)

One who has adopted one of these four rules, &c. (see II, 1, 11, § 12).

This is the whole duty, &c.

Thus I say.
