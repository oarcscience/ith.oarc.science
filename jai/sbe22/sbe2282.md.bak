#### Life of Mahâvîra, Lecture 2

In that period, in that age the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, having on
the sixth day of the fourth month of summer, in the eighth fortnight,
the light (fortnight) of Ashâ*dh*a, descended from the great Vimâna, the
all-victorious and all-prosperous Pushpottara, which is like the lotus
amongst the best things, where he had lived for twenty Sâgaropamas till
the termination of his allotted length of life, of his (divine nature,
and of his existence (among gods); here in the continent of
*G*ambûdvîpa, in Bharatavarsha,--when of this Avasarpi*n*î era the
Sushama-sushamâ, the Sushamâ, and Sushamadu*h*shamâ periods, and the
greater part of the Du*h*shamasushamâ period (containing a
Ko*d*âko*d*i <span id="fr_528"></span>[3](#fn_521.md) of Sâgaropamas, less
forty-two thousand years) had elapsed, and only seventy-two years, eight
and a half months were left, after twenty-one Tîrthakaras of the race of
Ikshvâku and of the Kâ*s*yapa gotra, and two of the race of Hari and of
the Gautama gotra, on the whole twenty-three Tîrthakaras had
appeared,--the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, the last of the Tîrthakaras,
took the form of an embryo in the womb of Devânandâ, of the
*G*âlandharâya*n*a gotra, the wife of the Brâhma*n*a *Ri*shabhadatta, of
the gotra of Ko*d*âla, in the

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

brahmanical part of the town Ku*nd*agrâma in the middle of the night,
when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Uttaraphalgunî, after
his allotted length of life, of his (divine) nature, and of his
existence (amongst gods) had come to their termination. (2) <span
id="fr_529"></span>[1](#fn_522.md)

The knowledge of the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra (about this) was
threefold; he knew that he was to descend, he knew that he had
descended, he knew not when he was descending <span
id="fr_530"></span>[2](#fn_523.md).

In that night in which the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra took the form of
an embryo in the womb of the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ of the
*G*âlandharâya*n*a gotra, the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ was on her couch,
taking fits of sleep, in a state between sleeping and waking, and having
seen the following fourteen illustrious, beautiful, lucky, blest,
auspicious, fortunate great dreams, she woke up. (3) To wit:

An elephant, a bull, a lion, the anointing (of the goddess *S*rî), a
garland, the moon, the sun, a flag, a vase, a lotus lake, the ocean, a
celestial abode, a heap of jewels, and a flame. (4)

When the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ, having seen these dreams, woke up,
she--glad, pleased, and joyful in her mind, delighted, extremely
enraptured, with a heart widening under the influence of happiness, with
the hair of her body all erect in their pores like the flowers of the
Kadamba touched by rain-drops--firmly fixed the dreams (in her mind),
and rose from her couch. Neither hasty nor trembling, with a quick and
even <span id="fr_531"></span>[3](#fn_524.md) gait, like that of the

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

royal swan, she went to the Brâhma*n*a *Ri*shabhadatta, and gave him the
greeting of victory. Then she comfortably sat down in an excellent chair
of state; calm and composed, joining the palms of her hands so as to
bring the ten nails together, she laid the folded hands on her head, and
spoke thus: (5)

'O beloved of the gods, I was just now on my couch taking fits of sleep,
in a state between sleeping and waking, when I saw the following
fourteen illustrious, &c., great dreams; to wit, an elephant, &c. (6)

'O beloved of the gods, what, to be sure, will be the happy result
portended by these fourteen illustrious, &c., great dreams?' (7)

When the Brâhma*n*a *Ri*shabhadatta had heard and perceived this news
from the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ, he, glad, pleased, and joyful (see § 5,
down to) rain-drops, firmly fixed the dreams (in his mind), and entered
upon considering them. He grasped the meaning of those dreams with his
own innate intellect and intuition, which were preceded by reflection,
and thus spoke to the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ: (8)

'O beloved of the gods, you have seen illustrious dreams; O beloved of
the gods, you have seen beautiful, lucky, blest, auspicious, fortunate
dreams, which will bring health, joy, long life, bliss, and fortune! We
shall have success, O beloved of the gods, we shall have pleasure; we
shall have happiness, O beloved of the gods, we shall have a son!
Indeed, O beloved of the gods, after the lapse of nine complete months
and seven and a half days you will give birth to a lovely and handsome
boy with tender hands and feet, with a body containing the entire

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

and complete five organs of sense, with the lucky signs, marks, and good
qualities; a boy on whose body all limbs will be well formed, and of
full volume, weight, and length, of a lovely figure like that of the
moon! (9) And this boy, after having passed his childhood <span
id="fr_532"></span>[1](#fn_525.md), and, with just ripened intellect,
having reached the state of youth, will repeat, fully understand, and
well retain (in his mind) the four Vedas: the *Ri*g-veda, Ya*g*ur-veda,
Sâma-veda, Atharva-veda--to which the Itihâsa <span
id="fr_533"></span>[2](#fn_526.md) is added as a fifth, and the
Niggha*nt*u <span id="fr_534"></span>[3](#fn_527.md) as a sixth
(Veda)--together with their Aṅgas and Upâṅgas, and the Rahasya <span
id="fr_535"></span>[4](#fn_528.md); he will know the six Aṅgas, he will be
versed in the philosophy of the sixty categories <span
id="fr_536"></span>[5](#fn_529.md), and well grounded in arithmetic, in
phonetics, ceremonial, grammar, metre, etymology, and astronomy <span
id="fr_537"></span>[6](#fn_530.md), and in many other brahmanical \[and
monastic\] sciences besides. (10) Therefore, O beloved of the gods, you
have seen illustrious dreams, &c. (see § 9).'

In this way he repeatedly expressed his extreme satisfaction. (11)

When the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ had heard and perceived this news from the
Brâhma*n*a *Ri*shabhadatta, she--glad, pleased, and joyful, &c. (see §
5)--

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

joining the palms of her hands, &c. (see § 5, down to) and spoke thus:
(12)

'That is so, O beloved of the gods; that is exactly so, O beloved of the
gods; that is true, O beloved of the gods; that is beyond doubt, O
beloved of the gods; that is what I desire, O beloved of the gods; that
is what I accept, O beloved of the gods; that is what I desire and
accept, O beloved of the gods; that matter is really such as you have
pronounced it.'

Thus saying, she accepted the true meaning of the dreams, and enjoyed
together with *Ri*shabhadatta the noble permitted pleasures of human
nature. (13)

In that period, in that age, *S*akra,--the chief and king of the gods,
the wielder of the thunderbolt, the destroyer of towns, the performer of
a hundred sacrifices, the thousand-eyed one, Maghavan, the punisher of
the Daitya Pâka, the lord of the southern half of the earth <span
id="fr_538"></span>[1](#fn_531.md), the lord of the thirty-two thousand
celestial abodes, the bestrider of the elephant Airavata, the chief of
the Suras, who wears spotless clothes and robes <span
id="fr_539"></span>[2](#fn_532.md), and puts on garlands and the diadem,
whose cheeks were stroked by fine, bright, and trembling earrings of
fresh gold \[the most prosperous, the most brilliant, the most mighty,
the most glorious, the most powerful, and the most happy one\], with a
splendid body, ornamented with a long down-reaching garland,--this
*S*akra was in the Saudharma Kalpa, in the celestial abode Saudharma
Avata*m*saka, in the council-hall Sudharman, on his throne *S*akra; he
who exercises and maintains the supreme command, government,

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

management, guidance, direction, and sovereign power and generalship
over the thirty-two thousand gods of the celestial abodes, the
eighty-four thousand gods of a rank equal with that of himself, the
thirty-two chief gods, the four guardians of the world, the eight
principal queens with their trains, the three courts, the seven armies,
and the seven commanders of these armies. He was then enjoying the
permitted pleasures of divine nature under the great din of
uninterrupted story-telling, dramatical plays, singing, and music, as
beating of time, performance on the Vî*n*â, the Tûrya, the great drum,
and the Pa*t*upa*t*aha. (I 4)

And he viewed this whole continent *G*ambûdvîpa with his extensive
(knowledge called) Avadhi. There he saw in the continent *G*ambûdvîpa,
in Bhâratavarsha, in the southern half of Bharata, in the brahmanical
part of the town Ku*nd*agrâma, the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvira taking the
form of an embryo in the womb of the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ of the
*G*âlandharâya*n*a gotra, wife of the Brâhma*n*a *Ri*shabhadatta of the
gotra of Ko*d*âla; and--glad, pleased, and joyful in his mind,
delighted, extremely enraptured, with a heart widening under the
influence of happiness, with the hair of his body bristling and erect in
their pores like the fragrant flowers of Nîpa when touched by
rain-drops, with his eyes and mouth open like full-blown lotuses, with
his excellent, various <span id="fr_540"></span>[1](#fn_533.md), trembling
bracelets, with diadem and earrings, his breast lighted up by necklaces,
wearing long and swinging ornaments with a pearl pendant--the chief of
the gods rose

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

with confusion, hasty and trembling from his throne, descended from the
footstool, took off his shoes which were by a clever artist set with
Vaidûrya and excellent Rish*t*a and A*ñg*ana <span
id="fr_541"></span>[1](#fn_534.md), and ornamented with glittering jewels
and precious stones, threw his seamless robe over his left shoulder,
and, arranging the fingers of his hands in the shape of a bud, he
advanced seven or eight steps towards the Tîrthakara. Bending his left
knee and reposing on the right one, he three times placed his head on
the ground and lifted it a little; then he raised his
bracelet-encumbered arms, and joining the palms of his hands so as to
bring the ten nails together, laid the hands on his head and spoke thus:
(15)

'Reverence to the Arhats and Bhagavats; to the Âdikaras, the
Tîrthakaras, the perfectly-enlightened ones; to the highest of men, the
lions among men, the flowers among mankind <span
id="fr_542"></span>[2](#fn_535.md), the Gandhahastins among men; to the
highest in the world, the guides of the world, the benefactors of the
world, the lights of the world, the enlighteners of the world; to the
givers of safety, to the givers of sight, to the givers of the road, to
the givers of shelter, to the givers of life, to the givers of
knowledge <span id="fr_543"></span>[3](#fn_536.md); to the givers of the
law, the preachers of the law, the lords of the law, the leaders of the
law, the universal emperors of the best law; to the light, the help, the
shelter, the refuge, the resting-place, the possessors of unchecked
knowledge

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

and intuition who have got rid of unrighteousness; to the conquerors and
the granters of conquest, the saved and the saviours, the enlightened
and the enlighteners, the liberated and the liberators, to the
all-knowing ones, the all-seeing ones, to those who have reached the
happy, stable, unstained, infinite, unperishable, undecaying place,
called the path of perfection, whence there is no return; reverence to
the *G*inas who have conquered fear.

'Reverence to the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, the Âdikara, the last of
the Tîrthakaras who was predicted by the former Tîrthakaras, &c. <span
id="fr_544"></span>[1](#fn_537.md) I here adore the Revered One yonder, may
the Revered One yonder see me here!' With these words he adored, he
worshipped the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvira, and sat down on his excellent
throne facing the east. Then the following internal, reflectional,
desirable idea occurred to the mind of *S*akra, the chief of kings and
gods: (16)

'It never has happened, nor does it happen, nor will it happen, that
Arhats, *K*akravartins, Baladevas, or Vasudevas, in the past, present,
or future, should be born in low families, mean families, degraded
families, poor families, indigent families, beggars' families, or
brahmanical families. (17) For indeed Arhats, *K*akravartins, Baladevas,
and Vasudevas, in the past, present, and future, are born in high
families, noble families, royal families, noblemen's families, in
families belonging to the race of Ikshvâku, or of Hari, or in other
suchlike families of pure descent on both sides. (18)

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Now this is
something which moves the wonder of the world: it happens in the lapse
of numberless Avasarpi*n*îs and Utsarpi*n*îs, because the imperishable,
indescribable, and undestroyable Karman relating to name and gotra must
take effect, that Arhats, &c., in the past, present, and future, descend
in (i.e. take the form of an embryo in the womb of a woman belonging to)
low families, &c.; but they are never brought forth by birth from such a
womb. (19) This Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, now, in the continent
*G*ambudvîpa, in Bharatavarsha, in the brahmanical part of the town
Ku*nd*agrâma, has taken the form of an embryo in the womb of the
Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ of the *G*âlandharâya*n*a gotra, wife of the
Brâhma*n*a *Ri*shabhadatta of the gotra of Ko*d*âla. (20) Hence it is
the established custom of all past, present, and future *S*akras, chiefs
and kings of the gods, to cause the Arhats and Bhagavats to be removed
from such-like low, mean, &c., families, to such-like high, noble, &c.,
families. (21) It is, therefore, better that I should cause the
Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra, the last of the Tîrthakaras who was
predicted by the former Tîrthakaras, to be removed from the brahmanical
part of the town Ku*nd*agrâma, from the womb of the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ
of the *G*âlandharâya*n*a gotra, wife of the Brâhma*n*a *Ri*shabhadatta
of the gotra of Ko*d*âla, to the Kshatriya part of the town
Ku*nd*agrâma, and to be placed as an embryo in the womb of the
Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ of the Vâsish*th*a gotra, wife of the Kshatriya
Siddhârtha of the Kâ*s*yapa gotra, belonging to the clan of the
*Gñ*ât*ri* Kshatriya,; and to cause the embryo of the Kshatriyâ*n*î
Tri*s*alâ of the Vâsish*th*a gotra to be placed in the

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

womb of the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ of the *G*âlandharâya*n*a gotra.'

Thus he reflected and called Hari*n*egamesi <span
id="fr_545"></span>[1](#fn_538.md), the divine commander of the foot
troops; having called him, he spoke thus: (22)

Well, now, beloved of the gods, it never has happened, &c. (§§ 17-20 are
verbally repeated). (23-25)

'Therefore, go now and remove the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra from the
brahmanical part, &c., and place the embryo of the Kshatriyâ*n*î
Tri*s*alâ, &c. (see § 21). Having done this, return quickly to report on
the execution of my orders.' (26)

When Hari*n*egamesi, the divine commander of the foot troops, was thus
spoken to by *S*akra, the chief and king of the gods, he--glad, pleased,
and joyful, &c. (see § 15)--laid his folded hands on his head and
modestly accepted the words of command, saying, 'Just as your Majesty
commands.' After this he left the presence of *S*akra, the chief and
king of the gods, and descended towards the northeastern quarter; then
he transformed himself through his magical power of transformation, and
stretched himself out for numerous Yo*g*anas like a staff, (during which
he seized) jewels, Va*g*ra, Vai*d*ûrya, Lohitâksha, Masâragalla,
Ha*m*sagarbha, Pulaka, Saugandhika, *G*yotisara, A*ñg*ana,
A*ñg*anapulaka, *G*âtarûpa, Subhaga, Spha*t*ika, and Rish*t*a; (of these
precious materials) he rejected the gross particles, and retained the
subtle particles. (27) Then

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

for a second time he transformed himself through his magical power of
transformation, and produced the definitive form (which gods adopt on
entering the world of men); having done so, he passed with that
excellent, hasty, trembling, active, impetuous, victorious, exalted, and
quick divine motion of the gods right through numberless continents and
oceans, and arrived in *G*ambûdvîpa, in Bharatavarsha, in the
brahmanical part of the town Ku*nd*agrâma, at the house of the
Brâhma*n*a *Ri*shabhadatta, where the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ dwelt. Having
arrived there, he made his bow in the sight of the Venerable Ascetic
Mahâvîra, and cast the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ, together with her retinue,
into a deep sleep; then he took off all unclean particles, and brought
forth the clean particles, and saying, 'May the Venerable One permit
me,' he took the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvîra in the folded palms of his
hands without hurting him. Thus he went to the Kshatriya part of the
town Ku*nd*agrâma, to the house of the Kshatriya Siddhârtha, where the
Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ dwelt; he cast her and her attendants into a
deep sleep, took off all unclean particles, and brought forth the clean
particles, and placed the embryo of the Venerable Ascetic Mahâvira in
the womb of the Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ, and the embryo of the
Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ he placed in the womb of the Brâhma*n*î
Devânandâ of the *G*âlandharâya*n*a gotra. Having done so, he returned
in that direction in which he had come <span
id="fr_546"></span>[1](#fn_539). (28.md) With that excellent, &c. (see §
28), divine motion

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

of the gods, he flew upwards right through numberless continents and
oceans, taking thousands of Yo*g*anas in each motion, and arrived in the
Saudharma Kalpa, in the divine abode called Saudharma Avata*m*saka,
where *S*akra, the chief and king of the gods, sat on the throne called
*S*akra, and reported to *S*akra, the chief and king of the gods, on the
execution of his orders.

In that period, in that age the knowledge of the Venerable Ascetic
Mahâvîra was threefold; he knew that he was to be removed; he knew that
he was removed; he knew not when he was being removed <span
id="fr_547"></span>[1](sbe2283.htm#fn_540). (29.md)

In that period, in that age, on the thirteenth day of the third month of
the rainy season, in the fifth fortnight, the dark (fortnight) of
Â*s*vina, after the lapse of eighty-two days, on the eighty-third day
current (since his conception), the embryo of the Venerable Ascetic
Mahâvîra was, on the command of *S*akra, safely removed by
Hari*n*egamesi from the womb of the Brâhma*n*î Devânandâ to that of the
Kshatriyâ*n*î Tri*s*alâ <span
id="fr_548"></span>[2](sbe2283.htm#fn_541.md), in the middle of the night,
when the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Uttaraphalgunî. (30)
