#### SIXTH LESSON.

Thus I say: There are beings called the animate, viz. those who are
produced 1. from eggs (birds, &c.), 2. from a fetus (as elephants, &c.),
3. from a fetus with an enveloping membrane (as cows, buffaloes, &c.),
4. from fluids (as worms, &c.), 5. from sweat (as bugs, lice, &c.), 6.
by coagulation (as locusts, ants, &c.), 7. from sprouts (as butterflies,
wagtails, &c.), 8. by regeneration (men, gods, hell-beings). This is
called the Sa*m*sâra (1) for the slow, for the ignorant. Having well
considered it, having well looked at it, I say thus: all beings, those
with two, three, four senses, plants, those with five senses, and the
rest of creation, (experience) individually pleasure or displeasure,
pain, great terror, and unhappiness. Beings are filled with alarm from
all directions and in all directions. See! there the benighted ones
cause great pain. See! there are beings individually embodied. (2)

See! there are men who control themselves; others pretend only to be
houseless, for one destroys this (body of an animal) by bad and
injurious doings, and many other beings, besides, which he hurts by
means of animals, through his doing acts relating to animals. (3) About
this the Revered One has taught the truth: for the sake of the
splendour,

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

honour, and glory of this life, for the sake of birth, death, and final
liberation, for the removal of pain, man acts sinfully towards animals,
or causes others to act so, or allows others to act so. This deprives
him of happiness and perfect wisdom. About this he is informed, when he
has understood, or heard from the Revered One or from the monks, the
faith to be coveted. There are some who, of a truth, know this (i.e.
injuring) to be the bondage, the delusion, the death, the hell. For this
a man is longing, when he injures this (body of an animal) by bad and
injurious doings, and many other beings, besides, which he hurts by
means of animals, through acts relating to animals. Thus I say. (4)

Some slay (animals) for sacrificial purposes, some kill (animals) for
the sake of their skin, some kill (them) for the sake of their flesh,
some kill them for the sake of their blood; thus for the sake of their
heart, their bile, the feathers of their tail, their tail, their big or
small horns, their teeth, their tusks, their nails, their sinews, their
bones <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_108); with a purpose or without a
purpose. Some kill animals because they have been wounded by them, or
are wounded, or will be wounded. (5)

He who injures these (animals) does not comprehend and renounce the
sinful acts; he who does not injure these, comprehends and renounces the
sinful acts. Knowing them, a wise man should not act sinfully towards
animals, nor cause others to act so, nor allow others to act so. He who
knows

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

these causes of sin relating to animals, is called a reward-knowing
sage. Thus I say. (6)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_108"></span>[12:1](sbe2208.htm#fr_109) The word after bones
(a*tth*îe) is a*tth*imi*mg*âe, for which buffaloes, boars, &c. are
killed, as the commentator states. I do not know the meaning of this
word which is rendered asthimi*ñg*â.
