      Along with the five great vows, monks strive after the ten-fold
      virtues of a self controlled ascetic.  The layperson follows these
      virtues partially.

           Kshamaa        Forbearance, Forgiveness
           Maardava       Modesty, Humility
           Aarjava        Straightforwardness, Candor
           Saucha         Contentment
           Satya          Truthfullness
           Samyam         Self-restraint, Control of Senses
           Tapa           Austerity, Penance
           Tyaga          Renunciation
           Akinchanya     Non-attachment
           Brahmacharya   Celibacy, Chastity

      Monks are required to bear equanimity towards all living beings,
      friends and foes alike.

      In addition to the ten fold virtues Monks live on alms, do not eat
      food at night, do not use any kind of conveyance, and do not
      possess any property.

      Jain Dashlakshni parva which begins from Bhaadaravo Sud 5, and
      ends, Bhaadravo Sud 14, Ananta-chaturdashi, is the celebration of
      ten virtues, Each day is dedicated to one virtue.

      Bhaadaravo Vad 1, is called Kshamaavaanee day.  This is the day of
      forgiving and asking forgiveness.
