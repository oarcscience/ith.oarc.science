                  Twelve Bhavnas (Reflections or Thoughts)
                  ========================================

      Jain religion puts a significant emphasis on the thought process of
      a human being.  A person's behavior and his actions are the
      reflection of his internal thoughts, day in and day out.  It is not
      the action but intention behind the action results in the
      accumulation of Karma.

      One should be very careful about his thoughts, how he thinks, and
      the subject matter of his thought.

      To make room for pure thoughts, and to drive out the evil ones,
      Jainism recommends to meditate the following twelve thoughts or
      Bhavnas.

      The twelve Bhavnas described here are the subject matters of one's
      meditation, and how to occupy one's mind with useful, religious,
      beneficial, peaceful, harmless, spiritually advancing, Karma
      preventing thoughts.  They cover a wide field of teachings of
      Jainism.  They are designed to serve as aids to spiritual progress,
      produce detachment, and lead the aspirants from the realm of desire
      to the path of renunciation.  They are reflections upon the
      fundamental facts of life, intended to develop purity of thought
      and sincerity in the practice of religion.

      The reflections are also called Anuprekshas, longings, thoughts,
      aspirations, or Bhavnas.


         1. Anitya Bhavna    - Impermanence of the world
         2. Asarana Bhavna   - No one provides protection
         3. Samsara Bhavna   - No permanent relationship in universe
         4. Ekatva Bhavna    - Solitude of the soul
         5. Anyatva Bhavna   - Separateness
         6. Asuci Bhavna     - Impureness of the body
         7. Asrava Bhavna    - Influx of karma
         8. Samvara Bhavna   - Stoppage of influx of karma
         9. Nirjara Bhavna   - Shedding of karma
        10. Loka Bhavna      - Transitory of universe
        11. Bodhi-durlabha   - Unattainability of right faith,
            Bhavna             knowledge, and conduct
        12. Dharma Bhavna    - Unattainability of true preceptor,
                               scriptures, and religion


      1. Anitya Bhavna - Impermanence of the world
      ---------------------------------------------
      Under this reflection, one thinks that in this world every thing
      such as life, youth, wealth, property, etc.  are transient or
      subject to alteration.  Nothing in the universe is permanent, even
      though the whole universe is constant.  Spiritual values are
      therefore worth striving for as soul's ultimate freedom and
      stability.  This will help to break all earthly attachments.


      2. Asarana Bhavna - No one provides protection
      ----------------------------------------------
      Under this reflection, one thinks that he is helpless against
      death, old age, and disease.  The only way he can conquer death and
      disease is by destroying all his karma.  The soul is his own
      savior, and to achieve total freedom and enlightenment, one takes
      refuge to the true path and to the five best personalities. They
      are Arihanta, Siddha, Acharya, Upadhyay and Sadhus.  The
      refuge to others are due to delusion, and must be avoided.


      3. Samsara Bhavna - No permanent relationship in universe
      ---------------------------------------------------------
      Under this reflection, one thinks that the soul transmigrates from
      one life to the other in any of the four forms, human, animal,
      hellish, and heavenly.

      The continual cycle of birth, life, and death is full of pain and
      miseries, and has not yet ended.  There are no permanent worldly
      relations like father, mother, friend, foe, etc.  It is we who
      establish these relations and live accordingly.

      This kind of thought will help minimize or stop any attachments to
      anybody, other living beings, or objects.  The soul must achieve
      ultimate freedom from it, which is liberation or Moksha.


      4. Ekatva Bhavna - Solitude of the soul
      ----------------------------------------
      Under this reflection, one thinks that the soul is solitaire, and
      lonely in existence.  The soul assumes birth alone, and departs
      alone from the life form.  The soul is responsible for its own
      actions and karmas.  The soul will enjoy the fruits, and suffer bad
      consequences of its own action alone.  Such thoughts will stimulate
      his efforts to get rid of karmas by his own initiative and will
      lead religious life.


      5. Anyatva Bhavna - Separateness
      --------------------------------
      Under this reflection, one thinks that soul is separate from any
      other objects or living beings of the world.  Even his body is not
      his.  At the time of death, soul leaves the body behind.  The body
      is matter, while the soul is all consciousness.

      The soul therefore should not develop attachment for worldly
      objects, and other living beings.  He should not allow himself to
      be controlled by desires, greed, and urges of the body.


      6. Asuci Bhavna - Impureness of the body
      ----------------------------------------
      Under this reflection, one thinks about the constituent element of
      one's body.  It is made of impure things like blood, bones, flesh,
      etc.  It also generates impure things like perspiration, urine,
      stool, etc.

      The soul, which resides within the body, is unattached to the body.
      It is alone and pure.  The body ultimately becomes nonexistent,
      but the soul is eternal.

      Therefore emotional attachments to the body is useless.


      7. Asrava Bhavna - Influx of karma
      ----------------------------------
      Under this reflection, one thinks about karma streaming into the
      soul.  Every time he enjoys or suffers through the senses (touch,
      taste, smell, sight, and hearing) he makes his karma increase.
      This thought will make him more careful, and will try to stop the
      influx of karmas.


      8. Samvara Bhavna - Stoppage of influx of karma
      -----------------------------------------------
      Under this reflection, one thinks about stopping evil thoughts,
      and becomes absorbed in achieving spiritual knowledge, meditation,
      etc.  This prevents the influx of karma.


      9. Nirjara Bhavna - Shedding of karma
      --------------------------------------
      Under this reflection, one thinks about the evil consequences of
      karma, and striving to destroy the previously acquired karma by
      austerity and meditation.


      10. Loka Bhavna - Transitory of universe
      ----------------------------------------
      Under this reflection, one thinks about the real nature of this
      universe.  Judging from the standpoint of substance, it is eternal
      but from the standpoint of modification it is transitory.

      Thus all objects of the world come into existence and perish.  This
      thought makes him understand the true nature of reality, which is
      necessary for right knowledge.


      11. Bodhi-durlabha Bhavna - Unattainability of right faith,
      -------------------------   knowledge, and conduct

      Under this reflection, one thinks that it is very difficult for the
      transmigrating soul to acquire right faith, right knowledge, and
      right conduct in this world.  Therefore, when one's has the
      opportunity to be a religious person, take the advantage of it to
      develop right religious talent.  This thought will strengthen one's
      effort to attain them, and live accordingly.


      12.  Dharma Bhavna - Unattainability of true preceptor,
      ------------------   scriptures, and religion

      Under this reflection, one thinks that the true preceptor,
      scriptures, and religion are excellent shelters in this world full
      of agony.  All other things lead to misery and suffering.


      Four Bhavnas or Virtues
      -----------------------
      Besides the twelve Bhavnas described above Jainism has laid great
      importance on the following four Bhavnas or virtues. They are
      mentioned here for clarification.

               Amity, love, and friendship   -   Maitri
               Appreciation, respect and joy -   Pramoda
               Compassion                    -   Karuna
               Equanimity and tolerance      -   Madhyastha
