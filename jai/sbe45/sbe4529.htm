<p>There was a Sthavira and Ga<I>n</I>adhara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_387"></A><A HREF="#fn_386"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the learned sage Garga. This leader of the Ga<I>n</I>a once made the following reflections: (1)</p>  
<p>'He who rides in a car, crosses a wilderness; he</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></A></p>  
<p>who rides, as it were, in (the car of) religious exercise, crosses the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra. (2)</p>  
<p>'But he who puts bad bullocks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_388"></A><A HREF="#fn_387"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> before his car, will be tired out with beating them; he will feel vexation, and his goad will be broken (at last). (3)</p>  
<p>'(A bad bullock) will bite its mate in the tail; it will wound the other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_389"></A><A HREF="#fn_388"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; it will break the pin of the yoke&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_390"></A><A HREF="#fn_389"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, or it will leave the road. (4)</p>  
<p>'It will fall down on its side, or sit down, or lie down; it will jump up or caper, or it will obstinately make for a young cow. (5)</p>  
<p>'It will furiously advance with its head lowered for an attack, or angrily go backward; it will stand still as if dead, or run at full speed. (6)</p>  
<p>'The cursed beast&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_391"></A><A HREF="#fn_390"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> will rend asunder the rope, or in its unruliness break the yoke; and roaring it will break loose and run off. (7)</p>  
<p>'Just as bad bullocks are when put before a car, so are bad pupils when yoked, as it were, to the car of the Law; they break down through want of zeal. (8)</p>  
<p>'Some attach great importance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_392"></A><A HREF="#fn_391"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> to their success;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></A></p>  
<p>some to their good fare; some to their comfort; some nurse their anger. (9)</p>  
<p>'Some are averse to begging; some are afraid of insults and are stuck up; (how can) I convince them by reasons and arguments&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_393"></A><A HREF="#fn_392"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (?) (10)</p>  
<p>'(A bad pupil) makes objections, and points out (imagined) difficulties; he frequently acts in opposition to the words of the superiors. (11)</p>  
<p>'(He will say if sent to a lady): "She does not know me, she will give me nothing; I suppose she will be gone out; send some other monk there." (12)</p>  
<p>'If sent on an errand, they do not do what they were bidden&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_394"></A><A HREF="#fn_393"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, but stroll about wherever they like; or deporting themselves like servants of the king&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_395"></A><A HREF="#fn_394"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, they knit their brows (when speaking to other people). (13)</p>  
<p>'After they have been instructed, admitted into the order, and nourished with food and drink, they disperse in all directions like geese whose wings have grown.' (14)</p>  
<p>Now this driver (viz. Garga), who had to deal with bad bullocks, thought: 'What have I to do with bad pupils? I am disheartened. (15)</p>  
<p>'As are bad pupils, so are bad bullocks; I shall leave these lazy donkeys, and shall practise severe austerities.' (16)</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="green">p. 152</font></A></p>  
<p>That noble man, who was full of kindness, grave, and always meditating, wandered about on the earth, leading a virtuous life. (17)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_386"></A><A HREF="sbe4529.htm#fr_387">149:1</A> Ga<I>n</I>a seems to correspond to the modern Ga<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a; see part i, p. 288, note 2. Ga<I>n</I>adhara, therefore, does not denote here, as usual, a disciple of T&icirc;rthakara.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_387"></A><A HREF="sbe4529.htm#fr_388">150:1</A> Khalu<I>m</I>ka = galiv<I>ri</I>shabha. Gali is explained in the dictionaries: a strong but lazy bull. In verse 16 we meet with galigaddaha = galigardabha, as synonymous with khalu<I>m</I>ka.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_388"></A><A HREF="sbe4529.htm#fr_389">150:2</A> The commentator understands the first line of this verse as having reference to the angry driver. But though an angry driver will perhaps, for all I know, put his bullock's tail to his teeth, still it is harder to supply another subject in the first line than in the second, and in the following verses.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_389"></A><A HREF="sbe4529.htm#fr_390">150:3</A> Samil&acirc; = yugarandhrak&icirc;laka, Ava<I>k</I>&ucirc;ri.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_390"></A><A HREF="sbe4529.htm#fr_391">150:4</A> <I>Kh</I>im&acirc;la = <I>g</I>&acirc;ra, see H&ecirc;ma<I>k</I>andra, D&ecirc;<I>s</I>&icirc; K&ocirc;sha 3, 27. It is a coarse term, which I replace by another, though probably the language of our coach-drivers might supply us with a more idiomatic rendering.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_391"></A><A HREF="sbe4529.htm#fr_392">150:5</A> G&acirc;rava, cf. <A HREF="sbe4521.htm#page_98">p. 98</A>, note <A HREF="sbe4521.htm#fn_257">2</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_392"></A><A HREF="sbe4529.htm#fr_393">151:1</A> The metre of this verse seems to have originally been &Acirc;ry&acirc;, but an attempt has been made to change it into Anush<I>t</I>ubh. We meet here with the interesting form a<I>n</I>us&acirc;samm&icirc; (read a<I>n</I>usasammi) = anu<I>s</I>&acirc;smi.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_393"></A><A HREF="sbe4529.htm#fr_394">151:2</A> This seems to be the meaning of the word paliu<I>m</I><I>k</I>anti. The commentators say, after other explanations, that they pretend not to have met the person to whom they were sent.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_394"></A><A HREF="sbe4529.htm#fr_395">151:3</A> R&acirc;<I>g</I>ave<I>t</I><I>th</I>i<I>m</I> va mannant&acirc;; ve<I>t</I><I>th</I>i = vish<I>t</I>i, hire.</P>
