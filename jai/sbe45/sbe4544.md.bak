### SECOND CHAPTER.

A sage thinks that he should leave off sins just as (a snake) leaves its
slough; and he is not proud of his Gôtra and other advantages; or is
there any use in blaming others? (1)

A man who insults another will long whirl in the Circle of Births; to
blame others is not good. Considering this a sage is not conceited. (2)

He who is independent, and he who is the servant of a servant, if they
but observe the Vow of Silence <span id="fr_742"></span>[2](#fn_738.md),
they have no reason to be ashamed; (therefore a monk) should behave
equally towards all. (3)

Indifferent and pure with regard to every kind of control, a *S*rama*n*a
should walk about; he who entertains pure thoughts during his whole
life, dies as a worthy and wise man. (4)

The sage who sees the far-off (goal, viz. liberation), past and future
things, will practise indifference, though he suffer corporal punishment
and be beaten. (5)

Possessing perfect wisdom, a sage always vanquishes (his passions); he
correctly expounds the

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Law; he never
neglects even the smallest (duty); he is neither angry nor proud. (6)

A man who controls himself according to (the Law), which is praised by
many people, and is not bound by any worldly ties, who is always pure
like a lake, proclaims the Law of Kâ*s*yapa. (7)

Seeing that numerous living beings lead an individual life, and that
every one feels (pleasure and pain) just as the others, a wise man who
observes the Vow of Silence, leaves off (injuring them). (8)

A sage has completely mastered the Law, and has ceased to do actions;
but the selfish grieve, they will not (thereby) recover their (lost)
property <span id="fr_743"></span>[1](#fn_739). (9.md)

Know that it (viz. property) entails pains in this world, and very great
pains <span id="fr_744"></span>[2](#fn_740.md) in the next. Who will lead a
domestic life when he knows that everything must perish? (to)

One should know (and renounce) the great attachment (to the world), and
respect and honours on earth; (for conceit) is a very thin thorn
difficult to pull out. A wise man, therefore, should abandon
worldliness <span id="fr_745"></span>[3](#fn_741). (11.md)

A monk should perform postures (as Kâyôtsarga, &c.) alone on his seat,
and alone on his couch he should meditate; excelling in the performance
of austerities, guarded in words, and restrained in thoughts. (12)

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

An ascetic does not shut the door of a deserted house (where he puts
up), nor does he open it; when asked he returns no (rude) answer; he
cuts no grass, nor does he strew it (on the ground for a couch). (13)

Where (he is) at sunset, there he calmly (performs his duties); a sage
bears pleasant and unpleasant things, be there insects, or wild beasts,
or snakes. (14)

He bears the three kinds of calamities arising from beasts, men, and
gods. A great sage will not be seized with a shivering, &c. <span
id="fr_746"></span>[1](#fn_742), when he stays in a deserted house. (15.md)

He should not fear for his life, nor should he desire to be praised (for
his courage). Fearful things will frighten the mind of a monk who stays
in a deserted house. (16)

They say that he who is very well disciplined, who protects others, who
lives in a place removed from other people, who is not frightened by
dangers, possesses right conduct, &c. (17)

A monk who uses warm or hot water <span id="fr_747"></span>[2](#fn_743.md),
who follows the Law, and loathes (wrong conduct), will by intercourse
with bad kings become deficient in his devotion though he be ever so
virtuous. (18)

When a monk quarrels and uses very bad language, he will suffer great
spiritual loss; therefore a wise man should not quarrel. (19)

He who abstains from cold water <span id="fr_748"></span>[2](#fn_743.md),
who plans (or undertakes) nothing, and has ceased from even the smallest
actions, who does not eat food out of the dish of a householder,
possesses right conduct, &c. (20)

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

Though life cannot be prolonged, as the saying is <span
id="fr_749"></span>[1](#fn_744.md), still foolish people sin recklessly; a
foolish man is filled to the brim (as it were) with sins. Considering
this a sage is not conceited. (21)

By self-invented rites common people seek holiness <span
id="fr_750"></span>[2](#fn_745.md), they are full of deceit and shrouded
(as it were) in delusion. But a monk is holy <span
id="fr_751"></span>[2](#fn_745.md) through his innocence, he allows no
troubles <span id="fr_752"></span>[3](#fn_746.md) to influence his words,
(thoughts, and acts). (22)

As a clever gambler, playing at dice, is not vanquished, since he casts
the K*ri*ta, but not Kali, nor Trêta, nor Dvâpara; (23)

So adopt for your welfare the best and highest Law which has been
proclaimed in this world by the Saviour, as the clever (gambler casts)
the K*ri*ta, and avoids the other casts. (24)

I have heard that sensual pleasures are said to have the strongest hold
on men; but those who abstain from them follow the Law of Kâ*s*yapa.
(25)

Those who follow the Law that has been proclaimed by *Gñ*ât*ri*ka, the
great seer <span id="fr_753"></span>[4](#fn_747.md), are virtuous and
righteous; they confirm each other in the Law. (26)

Take no heed of the seductive (pleasures), endeavour to shake off
delusion. Those who are not subdued by the wicked (pleasures), know
meditation to be their duty <span id="fr_754"></span>[5](#fn_748). (27.md)

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

A monk should not tell stories, nor ask idle questions, nor gossip <span
id="fr_755"></span>[1](#fn_749.md). But, knowing the highest Law, he should
perform his religious duties, and regard nothing his own. (28)

A monk should not indulge deceit <span id="fr_756"></span>[2](#fn_750.md),
greed <span id="fr_757"></span>[3](#fn_751.md), pride <span
id="fr_758"></span>[4](#fn_752.md), and wrath <span
id="fr_759"></span>[5](#fn_753.md). Those are virtuous who have arrived at
the right understanding of these passions, and who have well practised
control <span id="fr_760"></span>[6](#fn_754). (29.md)

(A monk) should be free from attachment, wise, controlling himself,
seeking the Law, earnest in the performance of austerities, and subduing
his senses. It is difficult to obtain the soul's benefit. (30)

Right conduct, &c., which has been taught by the *Gñ*ât*ri*ka, the sage
who knew everything in the whole world, has either not been learned or
not been truly practised (by creatures now in distress). (31)

Many men who thought this Law to be the highest good and conducive to
their spiritual welfare, obeyed their preceptors, ceased from works, and
have crossed the great flood (of worldly existence). (32)

Thus I say.

<span id="fn_738"></span>[253:2](sbe4544.htm#fr_742.md) Maunapada.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[254:1](sbe4544.htm#fr_743.md) *S*îlâṅka quotes a
verse which the Nâgâr*g*unîyas insert here; compare part i, p. 32, note
2.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[254:2](sbe4544.htm#fr_744.md) I take duha*m*duha
for a kind of intensive form of duha.

<span id="fn_741"></span>[254:3](sbe4544.htm#fr_745.md) This is a rather
dark verse. *S*îlâṅka, after explaining it, quotes the verse as it was
read by the Nâgâr*g*unîyas, which may be rendered thus: Respect and
honours are a great obstacle, this he should know; be the thorn small
(or) difficult to pull out, a wise man should remove it by the (means we
are about to describe).

<span id="fn_742"></span>[255:1](sbe4544.htm#fr_746.md) Literally,
horripilation. By the '&c.' the other outward signs of horror are
indicated.

<span id="fn_743"></span>[255:2](sbe4544.htm#fr_748.md) It should be kept
in mind that *G*aina monks are forbidden to use cold water, because it
is considered to possess life.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[256:1](sbe4544.htm#fr_749.md) Compare
Uttarâdhyayana IV, I, above p. 18. The same words recur below, I, 2, 3,
30, p. 259.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[256:2](sbe4544.htm#fr_751.md) Palêti = pralîyatê.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[256:3](sbe4544.htm#fr_752.md) Literally, cold and
heat.

<span id="fn_747"></span>[256:4](sbe4544.htm#fr_753.md) Mahâvîra.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[256:5](sbe4544.htm#fr_754.md) Âhitam, literally,
has been declared. The commentators explain the word as â-hitam,
thoroughly good, or âtmani vyavasthitam, placed in the soul.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[257:1](sbe4544.htm#fr_755.md) Samprasâraka?

<span id="fn_750"></span>[257:2](sbe4544.htm#fr_756.md) *Kh*anna = mâyâ.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[257:3](sbe4544.htm#fr_757.md) Pasa*m*sa =
pra*s*a*m*sâ, lôbha.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[257:4](sbe4544.htm#fr_758.md) Ukkâsa = utkarsha,
mâna.

krôdha.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[257:6](sbe4544.htm#fr_760.md) Dhuya = dhûta. The
word preceding this is sugôsiya*m* = *g*ush*t*a*m*, sêvita*m*. A various
reading is su*gh*ôsiya*m*, which means 'who have well annihilated their
Karman (dhûta).'
