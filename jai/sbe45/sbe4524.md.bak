### TWENTY-SECOND LECTURE.

###### RATHANÊMI.

In the town of *S*auryapura <span id="fr_291"></span>[2](#fn_290.md) there
was a powerful king, Vasudêva by name, who possessed the characteristic
marks of a king. (1)

He had two wives, Rôhi*n*î and Dêvakî; each of them had a beloved son,
Râma and Kê*s*ava. (2)

In the town of *S*auryapura there was (another) powerful king,
Samudravi*g*aya by name, who possessed the characteristic marks of a
king. (3)

His wife was *S*ivâ by name; and her famous son was the venerable
Arish*t*anêmi, the saviour of the world and the lord of ascetics. (4)

This Arish*t*anêmi, who was gifted with an excellent voice and possessed
the thousand and eight lucky marks of the body, was a Gautama, and his
skin was black. (5)

His body was strong like that of a bull, and hard

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

like steel; he was well proportioned, and had a belly like that of a
fish.

Kê*s*ava asked the girl Râ*g*îmatî <span id="fr_292"></span>[1](#fn_291.md)
in marriage for him. (6)

Now this daughter of an excellent king <span
id="fr_293"></span>[2](#fn_292.md) was virtuous and well looking; she
possessed all lucky marks of the body, and shone forth like the
lightning Saudâmanî. (7)

Her father said to the powerful Vâsudêva: 'Let the prince come here that
I may give him my daughter.' (8)

He had taken a bath containing all (lucky) herbs, and had performed the
customary ceremonies; he wore a suit of heavenly clothes and was decked
out with ornaments. (9)

Riding on the best mast elephant <span id="fr_294"></span>[3](#fn_293.md)
of Vâsudêva he looked beautiful, like a jewel worn on the head. (10)

He sat under a raised umbrella, fanned by two chowries, and he was
surrounded on all sides by a host of Da*s*ârhas <span
id="fr_295"></span>[4](#fn_294.md) and by a complete army drawn

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

up in rank and file, while the heavenly sound of musical instruments
reached the sky. (11, 12)

With such pomp and splendour the hero of the V*ri*sh*n*is started from
his own palace. (13)

On his way he saw animals, kept in cages and enclosures, overcome by
fear and looking miserable. (14)

Seeing them on the point of being killed for the sake of their flesh,
and to be eaten afterwards, the great sage spoke to his charioteer <span
id="fr_296"></span>[1](#fn_295) thus: (15.md)

'Why are <span id="fr_297"></span>[2](#fn_296.md) all these animals, which
desire to be happy, kept in cages and enclosures?' (16)

Then the charioteer answered: 'Lucky are these animals because at thy
wedding they will furnish food for many people.' (17)

Having heard these words, which announced the slaughter of many animals,
the great sage, full of compassion and kindness to living beings,
meditated thus: (18)

'If for my sake many living beings are killed, I shall not obtain
happiness in the next world.' (19)

Then the famous man presented the charioteer with his pair of earrings,
his neck-chain, and all his ornaments. (20)

When he had formed his resolution, the gods

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

descended (from heaven), according to the established custom, to
celebrate, with great pomp together with their retinue, the event of his
renunciation. (21)

Surrounded by gods and men, and sitting on an excellent palankin, the
Venerable One left Dvârakâ and ascended mount Raivataka <span
id="fr_298"></span>[1](#fn_297) (22.md)

On arriving at the park he descended from his excellent palankin,
surrounded by a crowd of thousands, and then his renunciation took
place, while the moon was in conjunction with *K*itrâ <span
id="fr_299"></span>[2](#fn_298). (23.md)

Then he himself plucked out his delightfully-perfumed, soft, and curled
hair in five handfuls. (24)

And Vâsudêva said to that subduer of the senses, who had plucked out his
hair: 'O lord of ascetics, may you soon obtain what you wish and desire.
(25)

'Increase in knowledge, faith, and right conduct, in forbearance and
perfection!' (26)

In this manner Râma and Kêsava, the Da*s*ârhas, and many people paid
homage to Arish*t*anêmi and then returned to the town of Dvârakâ. (27)

When the daughter of the king heard of the ordination of the *G*ina,
laughter and gaiety forsook her, and she was overwhelmed with
affliction' <span id="fr_300"></span>[3](#fn_299). (28.md)

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

Râ*g*îmatî thought: 'Shame upon my life, that I have been forsaken by
him! it is better I should turn nun.' (29)

Firm and decided she cut off her tresses which were black like bees and
dressed with a brush and comb <span id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_300.md).
(30)

And Vâsudêva said to her who had cut off her hair, and subdued her
senses: 'Lady, cross the dreadful ocean of the Sa*m*sâra without
difficulty!' (31)

When she had entered the order, the virtuous and very learned lady
induced there many people, her relations and servants, to enter the
order too. (32)

On her way to mount Raivataka it began to rain; her clothes being wet,
she entered a cave and waited there in the darkness while it was
raining. (33)

She took off her clothes and was naked as she was born, thus she was
seen by Rathanêmi <span id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_301.md), whose

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (peace of) mind
became (thereby) disturbed; and afterwards she saw him. (34)

She was frightened when she discovered herself alone with the monk;
folding her arms over her breast she sank down trembling. (35)

When the prince, Samudravi*g*aya's son, saw her frightened and
trembling, he spoke the following words: (36)

'I am Rathanêmi, O dear, beautiful, sweetly-speaking lady! Do accept me
for your lover, O slender one <span id="fr_303"></span>[1](#fn_302.md), you
shall have no cause to complain. (37)

'Come, let us enjoy pleasures, for it is a rare chance to be born a
human being; after we have enjoyed pleasures, we shall enter on the path
of the *G*inas.' (38)

When Râ*g*îmatî perceived that Rathanêmi's strength of will was broken,
and temptation had got the better of him, she did not lose her presence
of mind and defended her Self on that occasion. (39)

The daughter of the best king, true to self-control and her vows,
maintained the honour of her clan and family, and her virtue, and spoke
to him: (40)

'If you owned the beauty of Vai*s*rama*n*a <span
id="fr_304"></span>[2](#fn_303.md), the pleasing manners of
Nalakûbara <span id="fr_305"></span>[3](#fn_304.md), if you were like
Purandara <span id="fr_306"></span>[4](#fn_305.md) himself, I should have
no desire for you. (41)

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

'Fie upon you, famous knight, who want to quaff the vomited drink for
the sake of this life; it would be better for you to die <span
id="fr_307"></span>[1](#fn_306). (42.md)

'I am the daughter of the Bhôga-king <span
id="fr_308"></span>[2](#fn_307.md), and you are an Andhakav*ri*sh*n*i;
being born in a noble family let us not become like
Gandhana-snakes <span id="fr_309"></span>[3](#fn_308.md); firmly practise
self-control! (43)

'If you fall in love with every woman you see, you will be without hold
like the Ha*th*a-plant <span id="fr_310"></span>[4](#fn_309.md), driven
before the wind. (44)

'As a herdsman or a keeper of goods does not own the things (he has the
care of), so you will not truly own *S*rama*n*ahood.' (45)

Having heard these well-spoken words of the virtuous lady, he returned
to the Law like an elephant driven by the hook <span
id="fr_311"></span>[5](#fn_310). (46.md)

Protected in thoughts, words, and acts, subduing his senses and keeping
the vows, he practised true *S*rama*n*ahood throughout life. (47)

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

After practising severe austerities both of them became Kêvalins, and
having completely annihilated their Karman, they reached the highest
perfection. (48)

Thus act the enlightened, the wise, the clever ones; they turn from
pleasures as did this best of men <span id="fr_312"></span>[1](#fn_311.md).
(49)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_290"></span>[112:2](sbe4524.htm#fr_291.md) According to the
Brahmanical account Vasudêva lived in Mathurâ. The name given to the
town by the *G*ainas is apparently derived from *S*auri, an epithet of
K*ri*sh*n*a, whose grandfather was *S*ûra. Soriyapura may be
*S*aurikapura or *S*auryapura. The latter rendering adopted by our
commentators is based on a wrong etymology.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[113:1](sbe4524.htm#fr_292.md) Râîmai, Râimaî, and
Râyamatî are the forms of her name in Prâk*ri*t; the spellings
Râ*g*imatî and Râ*g*amatî are also met with in Sanskrit.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[113:2](sbe4524.htm#fr_293.md) Viz. Ugrasêna. He
was placed on the throne by K*ri*sh*n*a on the death of Ka*m*sa, cf.
Vish*n*u Purâ*n*a V, 21. He and Dêvaka were the sons of Âhuka, Ka*m*sa
was a son of Ugrasêna, and Dêvakî a daughter of Dêvaka, loc. cit. IV,
14. According to the legend of K*ri*sh*n*a, as told by the Brahmans and
*G*ainas, *G*arâsandha afterwards repeatedly attacked Mathurâ.
K*ri*sh*n*a therefore built Dvârakâ on the shore of the western ocean,
and sent thither the Yâdava tribe, loc. cit. V, 22 and 23. The events
narrated in the text must be understood to have occurred in Dvârakâ, as
is evident from verse 21.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[113:3](sbe4524.htm#fr_294.md) Gandhahastin, an
elephant of the best class, whose very smell is sufficient, as is
believed, to frighten common elephants, see verse 55.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[113:4](sbe4524.htm#fr_295.md) Dasâra in
Prâk*ri*t. They are a clan descended from Yadu.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[114:1](sbe4524.htm#fr_296.md) In verse 10
Arish*t*anêmi rides on an elephant, but in the sequel he is supposed to
travel in a car. Unless the poet can be charged with having made this
blunder, which I think just possible, verse 10 must be considered a
later addition.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[114:2](sbe4524.htm#fr_297.md) The form of the
verb a*kkh*ahi*m* for a*kkh*anti is worthy of note, because hi*m* as
ending of the third person plural belongs to Apabhra*ms*a. It is
interesting to find a true Apabhra*ms*a form in a text so old as ours,
for it seems to prove that at all times Apabhra*ms*a went along with the
common Prâk*ri*t, a vulgar or low with a high middle-Indian language.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[115:1](sbe4524.htm#fr_298.md) Raivataka is mount
Girnâr in Ka*th*iawâ*d*. The hill is one of the most sacred places of
the *G*ainas, and is covered with temples of the *G*inas. It is also
sacred to the Hindus on account of its connection with the history of
K*ri*sh*n*a. The poetical description of mount Raivataka forms the
subject of the fourth sarga of the *S*i*s*upâlavadha by Mâgha.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[115:2](sbe4524.htm#fr_299.md) The lunar mansion,
the chief star of which is Spica or α Virginis.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[115:3](sbe4524.htm#fr_300.md) The lamentation of
Râ*g*îmatî on her husband's becoming an ascetic forms the subject of a
curious Sanskrit poem called Nêmidûtakâvya, by Vikrama, son of
Saṅgha*n*a, which has been edited in <span id="page_116">p. 116</span>
the Kâvyamâlâ of 1886. It is what is technically called a
samasyâpûra*n*a or gloss. The last line of each stanza is taken from the
Mêghadûta of Kâlidâsa, and the first three lines are added by the poet
to make the whole fit the circumstances of his tale.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[116:1](sbe4524.htm#fr_301.md) Ku*kk*apha*n*aga,
in Sanskrit kûr*k*aphanaka. According to the scholiasts phanaka is a
comb made of bamboo.--I have translated, 'cut off her tresses,' but
literally it is: 'plucked out her hair.' However, I do not think that
women also are to pluck out their hair.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[116:2](sbe4524.htm#fr_302.md) Rathanêmi was her
husband's elder brother. According to a legend told in Haribhadra's
*T*îkâ of the Da*s*avaikâlika Sûtra (see Leumann in the Journal of the
German Oriental Society, vol. 46, p. 597), Rathanêmi fell in love with
Râ*g*îmatî. But that lady in order to make him see his wrong, vomited a
sweet beverage she had drunk, in a cup and offered it him. On his
turning away with disgust she explained to him her meaning: she too had
been vomited, as it were, by Arish*t*anêmi, notwithstanding which he
wanted to have her. She then taught him the *G*aina creed, and he became
a monk.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[117:1](sbe4524.htm#fr_303.md) Suya*n*u = sutanu.
This may, however, be a proper name, a synonym of Râ*g*îmatî, for
according to the Hariva*ms*a 2029 and the Vish*n*u Purâ*n*a IV, 14,
Sutanu was a daughter of Ugrasêna.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[117:2](sbe4524.htm#fr_304.md) Vai*s*rama*n*a is a
Prâk*ri*t spelling for Vai*s*rava*n*a = Kubêra.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[117:3](sbe4524.htm#fr_305.md) Nalakûbara is
Vai*s*rama*n*a's son.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[117:4](sbe4524.htm#fr_306.md) Indra.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[118:1](sbe4524.htm#fr_307.md) The verses 42, 43,
44, 46 have been received in the Da*s*avaikâlika Sûtra II, 7-10, see
Leumann's edition of that Sûtra quoted in the note, p. 116. A metrical
German translation will be found in the same place.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[118:2](sbe4524.htm#fr_308.md) On the Bhôgas see
p. 71, note 2. It is perhaps here misspelt for Bhô*g*a. In the Vish*n*u
Purâ*n*a, Ka*m*sa, Ugrasêna's son, is twice called Bhô*g*arâ*g*a (see
Wilson's translation, ed. Hall, vol. iv, pp. 260, 271), in contradiction
to the common tradition which makes him an Andhaka, compare Pata*ñg*ali
on Pâ*n*ini IV, 1, 114.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[118:3](sbe4524.htm#fr_309.md) There are said to
be two kinds of snakes, the gandhana and the agandhana. The former can
be made to suck the poison from the wound they have inflicted; the other
will rather die than do so. Cf. Leumann, loc. cit., p. 597, note \*.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[118:4](sbe4524.htm#fr_310.md) Pistia Stratiotes,
an aquatic plant.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[118:5](sbe4524.htm#fr_311.md) Dêvêndra here
refers to the story of the Nûpurapa*nd*ita, of which he gives a small
portion in Prâk*ri*t. The whole story 's related in the
Pari*s*ish*t*aparvan of Hêma*k*andra, see the introduction to my edition
of that work in the Bibliotheca Indica.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[119:1](sbe4524.htm#fr_312.md) Compare the last
verse of the Ninth Lecture.
