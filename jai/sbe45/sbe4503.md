# UTTARÂDHYAYANA.

### FIRST LECTURE.

###### ON DISCIPLINE.

I shall explain in due order the discipline of a houseless monk, who has
got rid of all worldly ties. Listen to me. (1)

A monk who, on receiving an order <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_48.md)
from his superior <span id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_49.md), walks up to him,
watching his nods and motions, is called well-behaved. (2)

But a monk who, on receiving an order from his superior, does not walk
up to him, being insubordinate and inattentive, is called ill-behaved.
(3)

As a bitch with sore ears is driven away everywhere,

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

thus a bad, insubordinate, and talkative (pupil) is turned out. (4)

As a pig leaves a trough filled with grain to feed on faeces, so a brute
(of a man) turns away from virtue, and takes to evil ways. (5)

Hearing a man thus compared to a dog and a pig, he who desires his own
welfare, should adhere to good conduct. (6)

Therefore be eager for discipline, that you may acquire righteousness; a
son of the wise <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_50.md), who desires
liberation <span id="fr_52"></span>[2](#fn_51.md), will not be turned away
from anywhere. (7)

One should always be meek, and not be talkative in the presence of the
wise; one should acquire valuable knowledge, and avoid what is
worthless. (8)

When reprimanded a wise man should not be angry, but he should be of a
forbearing mood; he should not associate, laugh, and play with mean men.
(9)

He should do nothing mean <span id="fr_53"></span>[3](#fn_52.md), nor talk
much; but after having learned his lesson, he should meditate by
himself. (10)

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

If he by chance does anything mean, he should never deny it, but if he
has done it, he should say: 'I have done it;' if he has not done it, 'I
have not done it.' (11)

He should not, in every case, wait for the express command (of the
teacher) like an unbroken horse for the whip (of the rider), but like a
broken horse which sees the whip (of the rider) he should commit no evil
act. (12)

Disobedient, rough speaking, ill-behaved pupils will exasperate even a
gentle teacher; but those will soon win even a hot-tempered teacher who
humour him and are polite. (13)

He should not speak unasked, and asked he should not tell a lie; he
should not give way to his anger, and bear with indifference pleasant
and unpleasant occurrences. (14)

Subdue your Self, for the Self is difficult to subdue; if your Self is
subdued, you will be happy in this world and in the next. (15)

Better it is that I should subdue my Self by self-control and penance,
than be subdued by others with fetters and corporal punishment. (16)

He should never do anything disagreeable to the wise <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_53.md), neither in words nor deeds, neither
openly nor secretly. (17)

He should not (sit) by the side of the teacher, nor before him, nor
behind him; he should not touch (the teacher's) thigh with his own, nor
answer his call from the couch. (18)

A well-behaved monk should not sit on his hams <span
id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_54.md),

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

nor cross his arms <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_55.md), nor stretch out
his legs, nor stand (too) close to his teacher. (19)

If spoken to by the superior, he should never remain silent, but should
consider it as a favour; asking for his command <span
id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_56.md), he should always politely approach his
teacher. (20)

If the teacher speaks little or much, he should never grow impatient;
but an intelligent pupil should rise from his seat and answer (the
teacher's) call modestly and attentively. (21)

He should never ask a question when sitting on his stool or his bed, but
rising from his seat <span id="fr_58"></span>[3](#fn_57.md) and coming
near, he should ask him with folded hands. (22)

When a pupil who observes the above rules of conduct, questions the
teacher about the sacred text, its meaning, or both, he should deliver
it according to tradition. (23)

A monk should avoid untruth, nor should he speak positively (about
future things, his plans, &c.); he should avoid sinful speech, and
always keep free from deceit. (24)

He should not tell anything sinful or meaningless <span
id="fr_59"></span>[4](#fn_58.md)

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

or hurtful, neither for his own sake nor for anybody else's, nor without
such a motive. (25).

In barbers' shops <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_59.md) or houses, on the
ground separating two houses, or on the highway a single monk should not
stand with a single woman, nor should he converse with her. (26)

Any instruction the wise ones <span id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_60.md) may
give me in a kind or a rough way, I shall devotedly accept, thinking
that it is for my benefit. (27)

(The teacher's) instruction, his manner of giving it, and his blaming
evil acts are considered blissful by the intelligent, but hateful by the
bad monk. (28)

Wise, fearless monks consider even a rough instruction as a benefit, but
the fools hate it, though it produces patience and purity of mind. (29)

He should occupy a low, firm seat, which does not rock; seldom rising
and never without a cause, he should sit motionless. (30)

At the right time a monk should sally forth, and he should return at the
right time; avoiding to do anything out of time, he should do what is
appropriate for each period of the day. (31)

A monk should not approach (dining people) sitting in a row, but should
collect alms that are freely given; having begged according to the
sanctioned rules, he should eat a moderate portion at the proper time.
(32)

A monk should wait (for his alms) alone, not too far from other monks,
nor too near them, but so that he is not seen by another party; another
monk should not pass him to get the start of him. (33)

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

Neither boldly erect nor humbly bowing down, standing neither too close
by nor too far off, a monk should accept permitted <span
id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_61.md) food that was prepared for somebody
else <span id="fr_63"></span>[2](#fn_62). (34.md)

In a place that is covered above and sheltered on all sides, where there
are no living beings nor seeds, a monk should eat in company, restrained
and undressed. (35)

A monk should avoid as unallowed such food as is well dressed, or well
cooked, or well cut, or such in which is much seasoning, or which is
very rich, or very much flavoured, or much sweetened <span
id="fr_64"></span>[3](#fn_63). (36.md)

(The teacher) takes delight in instructing a clever (pupil), just as the
rider (in managing) a well-broken horse; but he tires to instruct a
foolish (pupil), just as the rider (tires to manage) an unbroken horse.
(37)

(A bad pupil thinks:) 'I get but knocks and boxes on the ear, hard words
and blows;' and he believes a teacher who instructs him well, to be a
malevolent man. (38)

A good pupil has the best opinion (of his teacher), thinking that he
treats him like his son or brother or a near relation <span
id="fr_65"></span>[4](#fn_64.md); but a malevolent pupil imagines himself
treated like a slave. (39)

He should not provoke his teacher's anger, nor

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

should he himself grow angry; he should not offend the teacher nor
irritate him by proclaiming his faults <span
id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_65). (40.md)

Perceiving the teacher's anger one should pacify him by kindness,
appease him with folded hands, and promise not to do wrong again. (41)

He who adopts the conduct which the wise ones <span
id="fr_67"></span>[2](#fn_66.md) have attained by their virtues and always
practised, will not incur blame. (42)

Guessing the teacher's thoughts and the purport of his words, one should
express one's assent, and execute (what he desires to be done). (43)

An excellent pupil needs no express directions, or he is (at least)
quickly directed; he always carries out his duties as he is told. (44)

An intelligent man who has learned (the sacred texts) takes his duties
upon himself <span id="fr_68"></span>[3](#fn_67.md), and he becomes
renowned in the world; as the earth is the dwelling of all beings, so he
will be a dwelling of all duties. (45)

When the worthy teachers, who are thoroughly enlightened and from early
times well versed in conduct <span id="fr_69"></span>[4](#fn_68.md), are
satisfied (with a pupil), they will make over to him their extensive and
weighty <span id="fr_70"></span>[5](#fn_69.md) knowledge of the sacred
texts. (46)

His knowledge will be honoured, his doubts will be removed, he will
gladden the heart of his teacher

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

by his good acts; kept in safety by the performance of austerities and
by meditation, being as it were a great light, he will keep the five
vows. (47)

Honoured by gods, Gandharvas, and men, he will, on leaving this body
which consists of dirt and impurities, become either an eternal
Siddha <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_70.md), or a god of great power and
small imperfections. (48)

Thus I say <span id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_71.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_48"></span>[1:1](sbe4503.htm#fr_49.md) Â*n*â-niddêsa-karê.
Â*gñ*â is the order itself; nirdê*s*a, the assent to it.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[1:2](sbe4503.htm#fr_50.md) The original has the
plural instead of the singular. It takes great liberties in this
respect, and the commentators constantly call to help a va*k*anavyatyaya
or liṅgavyatyaya, exchange of number or gender, as the case may be. It
is impossible in the translation to follow the original in this respect,
and useless to note all such grammatical blunders. The conclusion we may
draw from them is that in the spoken language many grammatical forms
which in the literary language continued to be used, were on the point
of dying out or had already actually become obsolete. I am almost sure
that the vernacular of the time when the Sûtras were composed began to
drop the distinction between the singular and plural in the verb. It
was, however, artificially revived in the literary Mâhârâsh*t*rî of
later days.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[2:1](sbe4503.htm#fr_51.md) Buddhaputta. Buddha is
here and in the sequel explained by â*k*ârya, teacher. The word is in
the crude form, not in the inflected form, as the nominative would not
suit the metre. Liberties of this kind are frequently met with in our
text.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[2:2](sbe4503.htm#fr_52.md) Niôga*tth*î =
niyôgarthin. It is always explained and usually means môkshârthin. But
here and in verse 20 niyôga has perhaps its common meaning: appointment,
order. In that case we must translate: he who waits for an order.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[2:3](sbe4503.htm#fr_53.md) *K*a*nd*âliya,
literally, he should not demean himself like a *K*â*nd*âla. The
commentators, however, divide the word in *k*an*d*a, violent, hot, and
alîka, untrue, false. This explanation is too artificial to be accepted,
though the meaning comes to the same thing.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[3:1](sbe4503.htm#fr_54.md) Buddhâ*n*a*m*, i.e. the
superiors.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[3:2](sbe4503.htm#fr_55.md) Palhatthiyâ =
paryastikâ: so that his clothes cover his knees and shanks.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[4:1](sbe4503.htm#fr_56.md) Pakshapi*nd*a.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[4:2](sbe4503.htm#fr_57.md) Niyâga*tth*î or
niôga*tth*î. The commentator explains it, as in verse 7, by 'desiring
liberation.'

<span id="fn_57"></span>[4:3](sbe4503.htm#fr_58.md) Ukku*d*uô. The
commentator explains it by muktâsana*h*, kâra*n*ata*h*
pâdapu*ñkh*anâdigata*h*.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[4:4](sbe4503.htm#fr_59.md) In illustration of this
the commentator (Dêvêndra) quotes the following verse: êsha bandhyâsutô
yâti khapushpak*ri*ta*s*êkhara*h* \| m*ri*gat*ri*sh*n*âmbhasi snâta*h*
*s*a*s*a*sri*ṅgadhanurdhara*h* \|\| There goes the son of a barren
woman, bearing a chaplet of sky-flowers, having bathed in the water of a
fata morgana, and carrying a bow made of a hare's horn.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[5:1](sbe4503.htm#fr_60.md) Samara, explained by
the commentator barbers' shop or smithy, with the addition that it
includes all places of low people.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[5:2](sbe4503.htm#fr_61.md) Buddhâ*h*.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[6:1](sbe4503.htm#fr_62.md) Phâsuya, translated
prâsuka, and explained: free from living beings.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[6:2](sbe4503.htm#fr_63.md) Paraka*d*a, prepared
for the householder or some other person, but not for the monk himself.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[6:3](sbe4503.htm#fr_64.md) The translation of the
terms in this verse is rather conjectural, notwithstanding the
explanations in the commentary.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[6:4](sbe4503.htm#fr_65.md) I translate according
to the interpretation of the commentator, which is probably right; but
the text sets all rules of grammar at defiance.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[7:1](sbe4503.htm#fr_66.md) Literally, search for
the goad.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[7:2](sbe4503.htm#fr_67.md) Buddha.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[7:3](sbe4503.htm#fr_68.md) Namati, literally, bows
down.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[7:4](sbe4503.htm#fr_69.md) Puvvasa*m*thuya =
pûrvasa*m*stuta. Besides the meaning rendered in my translation the
commentator proposes another: already famous.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[7:5](sbe4503.htm#fr_70.md) A*tth*iya = arthika,
having an object or purpose, viz. môksha; it is therefore frequently
rendered: leading to liberation.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[8:1](sbe4503.htm#fr_71.md) I.e. a liberated or
perfected soul.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[8:2](sbe4503.htm#fr_72.md) Ti bêmi = iti bravîmi.
These words serve to mark the end of every chapter in all canonical
books; compare the Latin dixi.
