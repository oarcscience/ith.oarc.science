### FOURTH CHAPTER.

These (philosophers) who are vanquished (by their passions) cannot help
you in cases where a sinner perishes <span
id="fr_719"></span>[3](#fn_715.md); though having given up their former
occupations they will give advice in worldly matters. (1)

A wise monk who fully appreciates this, should not mix with those
(heretics); without conceit and not attached to them a sage should lead
a life equally removed (from love and hate). (2)

Some say that those who own possessions and engage in undertakings (may
reach perfection); but a monk should take his refuge to those who
neither own possessions nor engage in undertakings. (3)

A wise man should beg food which has been

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

prepared (for somebody else), and he should accept what is freely given
him, without greed and passions; he should abstain from overbearing
behaviour <span id="fr_720"></span>[1](#fn_716). (4.md)

He should know the talk of people: some say things which are the outcome
of a wrong understanding and are but opinions of others repeated. (5)

'The world is boundless and eternal, it exists from eternity and does
not perish <span id="fr_721"></span>[2](#fn_717); (another.md) bold
philosopher <span id="fr_722"></span>[3](#fn_718.md) says that the world is
limited, but eternal. (6)

'Some say that the knowledge (of the highest authority) is unlimited;
but the same bold philosopher says that it is limited in every way <span
id="fr_723"></span>[4](#fn_719).' (7.md)

Some beings have motion, others not; it depends on certain conditions
whether they are in the one state or in the other. (8)

(E. g. big creatures) have one form of bodily existence and then
another <span id="fr_724"></span>[5](#fn_720.md). But all are subject to
pain; hence they should not be killed. (9)

This is the quintessence of wisdom: not to kill anything. Know this to
be the legitimate conclusion

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

from the principle of the reciprocity with regard to non-killing <span
id="fr_725"></span>[1](#fn_721). (10.md)

Living (according to the rules of conduct), and without greed, one
should take care of the highest good <span
id="fr_726"></span>[2](#fn_722.md).

In walking, in sitting and lying down, and in food and drink: with
regard to these three points a monk should always control himself.

And he should leave off pride <span id="fr_727"></span>[3](#fn_723.md),
wrath <span id="fr_728"></span>[4](#fn_724.md), deceit <span
id="fr_729"></span>[5](#fn_725.md), and greed <span
id="fr_730"></span>[6](#fn_726). (11, 12.md)

Possessing the Samitis and being protected by the five Sa*m*varas, a
pious monk should live, till he reaches perfection, as a man free from
fetters among those bound in fetters (viz. the householders). (13)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_715"></span>[246:3](sbe4542.htm#fr_719.md) A various reading
first commented upon by *S*îlâṅka is: bâlâ pa*nd*itamâ*n*i*n*ô, being
ignorant men who fancy themselves learned.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[247:1](sbe4542.htm#fr_720.md) Omâ*n*a = apamâna.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[247:2](sbe4542.htm#fr_721.md) According to
*S*îlâṅka the eternity of things means, with these philosophers, that
one thing always retains the same genus or *g*âti, e.g. that he who was
a man in this life will again be a man in the next.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[247:3](sbe4542.htm#fr_722.md) According to the
commentators Vyâsa is intended. The doctrine referred to in the text is
that of the Purâ*n*as.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[247:4](sbe4542.htm#fr_723.md) The commentators
interpret this verse as if not two philosophical opinions but only one
was spoken of. Unlimited knowledge is according to them different from
omniscience; in the second part of the sentence 'limited' refers to the
sleep of Brahman during which he is unconscious.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[247:5](sbe4542.htm#fr_724.md) Men are some time
embryos, then young men, then old men.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[248:1](sbe4542.htm#fr_725.md) Ahi*m*sâsamaya*m* =
ahi*m*sâsamatâ*m*, viz. as you do not wish to be killed, so others do
not wish to be killed. The last part of the sentence might also be
translated: know this to be the real meaning of the Law (samaya) of
ahi*m*sâ. The same verse recurs I, 11, 10.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[248:2](sbe4542.htm#fr_726.md) Âdâna, right
knowledge, right faith, and right conduct.

<span id="fn_723"></span>[248:3](sbe4542.htm#fr_727.md) Ukkasa = utkarsha,
mâna.

<span id="fn_724"></span>[248:4](sbe4542.htm#fr_728.md) Gala*n*a =
*g*valana, krôdha.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[248:5](sbe4542.htm#fr_729.md) Nûma = mâyâ.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[248:6](sbe4542.htm#fr_730.md) Ma*ggh*attha =
madhyastha, lôbha. Compare the similar expressions in I, 1, 2, 12,
above, [p. 241](sbe4540.htm#page_241.md), notes 1-4, and I, 2, 2, 29,
below, [p. 257](sbe4544.htm#page_257.md).
