### TWELFTH LECTURE <span id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_158.md)

###### HARIKÊ*S*A.

Harikê*s*a-Bala was born in a family of *S*vapâkas (*K*â*nd*âlas); he
became a monk and a sage, possessed of the highest virtues, who had
subdued his senses. (1)

He observed the rules with regard to walking, begging, speaking, easing
nature, and receiving and keeping (of things necessary for a monk) <span
id="fr_160"></span>[2](#fn_159.md) controlled himself, and was always
attentive (to his duty). (2)

He protected from sin his thoughts, speech, and body <span
id="fr_161"></span>[3](#fn_160.md), and subdued his senses.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

Once on his begging tour, he approached the enclosure of a Brahmanical
sacrifice. (3)

When (the priests) saw him coming up, emaciated by austerities, in a
miserable condition, and with the poorest outfit, they laughed at him,
the ruffians. (4)

Stuck up by pride of birth, those killers of animals, who did not subdue
their senses, the unchaste sinners, made the following speech: (5)

'Who is that dandy coming there? he is swarthy, dreadful, with a
turned-up nose, miserably clad, a very devil <span
id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_161.md) of a dirty man, with a filthy cloth put
on his neck? (6)

'Who are you, you monster? or for what purpose have you come here? you
miserably clad devil of a dirty man! go, get away! why stand you there?'
(7)

At this turn the Yaksha, who lived in the Tinduka-tree, had compassion
on the great sage, and making his own body invisible spoke the following
words: (8)

"I am a chaste *S*rama*n*a, controlling myself; I have no property,
nothing belonging to me, and do not cook my food; I have come for food
which is dressed for somebody else at the time when I call. (9)

"You give away, eat, and consume plenty of food; know that I subsist by
begging; let the mendicant get what is left of the rest." (10)

'The dinner has been prepared for Brâhma*n*as, it has been got ready
especially for ourselves and for

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

us exclusively; we shall not give you such food and drink; why stand you
there?' (11)

"The husbandmen throw the corn on high ground and on low ground <span
id="fr_163"></span>[1](#fn_162), hoping (for a return.md). For the like
motive give unto me; I may be the field which may produce merit (as the
return for your benevolence)." (12)

'All the world knows that we are (as it were) the field on which gifts
sown grow up as merit; Brâhma*n*as of pure birth and knowledge are the
blessed fields.' (13)

"Those who are full of anger and pride, who kill, lie, steal, and own
property, are Brâhma*n*as without pure birth and knowledge; they are
very bad fields. (14)

"You are only the bearer of words as it were, you do not understand
their meaning, though you have learned the Vêdas. The saints call at
high and lowly (houses); they are the blessed fields." (15)

'Detractor of the learned doctors, how dare you speak thus in our
presence! This food and drink should rather rot, than we should give it
you, Nirgrantha <span id="fr_164"></span>[2](#fn_163).' (16.md)

"If you do not give me what I ask for, I who observe the Samitis, who am
protected by the Guptis <span id="fr_165"></span>[3](#fn_164.md), who
subdue my senses, what benefit, then, will you gain by your sacrifices?"
(17)

'Are here no Kshattriyas, no priests who tend the fire, no teachers with
their disciples, who will

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

beat him with a stick, or pelt him with a nut, take him by the neck, and
drive him off?' (18)

On these words of the teachers, many young fellows rushed forward, and
they all beat the sage with sticks, canes, and whips. (19)

At that turn king Kausalika's daughter, Bhadrâ, of faultless body, saw
that the monk was beaten, and appeased the angry youngsters. (20)

'He is the very man to whom the king, impelled by the devil (who
possessed me), had given me, but who would not think of me; he is the
sage whom princes and gods adore, who has refused me. (21)

'He is that austere ascetic, of noble nature, who subdues his senses and
controls himself; the chaste man, who would not accept me when my own
father, king Kausalika, gave me to him. (22)

'He is the man of great fame and might, of awful piety and power; do not
injure him who cannot be injured, lest he consume you all by the fire
(of his virtue).' (23)

When the Yakshas heard these well-spoken words of (the Purôhita's) wife
Bhadrâ, they came to the assistance of the sage, and kept the young men
off. (24)

Appearing in the air with hideous shapes, the Asuras beat the people.
When Bhadrâ saw them with rent bodies spitting blood, she spoke again
thus: (25)

'You may as well dig rocks with your nails, or eat iron with your teeth,
or kick fire with your feet, as treat contemptuously a monk. (26)

'Like a poisonous snake is a great sage of severe austerities, of
tremendous piety and power; like

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

a swarm of moths you will rush into a fire, if you beat a monk on his
begging tour. (27)

'Prostrate yourself before him for protection, you together with all of
them, if you want to save your life and your property; for in his wrath
he might reduce the world to ashes.' (28)

When the Brâhma*n*a saw the disciples bowing their back and head, and
holding out their hands, not minding their occupation; with streaming
eyes, spitting blood, looking upwards, their eyes and tongues
protruding, like as many logs of wood, he became heartbroken and
dejected, and together with his wife he appeased the sage: 'Forgive us
our injury and abuse, sir! (29, 30)

'Forgive, sir, these ignorant, stupid boys, that they injured you; sages
are exceedingly gracious, nor are the saints inclined to wrath.' (31)

"There is not the least hatred in me, neither now, nor before, nor in
future. The Yakshas attend upon me, therefore they have beaten the
boys." (32)

'You know the truth and the Law; you are not angry, compassionate sage;
we take refuge at your feet, we together with all of them. (33)

'We worship you, mighty sir; there is nothing in you that we do not
worship; eat this dish of boiled rice seasoned with many condiments.
(34)

'I have got plenty of food; eat it to do us a favour!' The noble (monk)
said 'yes,' and took food and drink after having fasted a whole month.
(35)

At that moment the gods caused a rain of perfumed water and flowers, and
showered down heavenly treasures; they struck the drums, and in the air
they praised the gift. (36)

'The value of penance has become visible, birth

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

appears of no value! Look at the holy Harikê*s*a, the son of a
*S*vapâka, whose power is so great.' (37)

"O Brâhma*n*as, why do you tend the fire, and seek external purity by
water? The clever ones say that external purity which you seek for, is
not the right thing. (38)

"You (use) Ku*s*a-grass, sacrificial poles, straw and wood, you touch
water in the evening and in the morning; thereby you injure living
beings, and in your ignorance you commit sins again and again." (39)

'How should we sacrifice, O monk, and how avoid sinful actions? Tell us,
ascetic, whom the Yakshas hold in honour, what do the clever ones
declare to be the right method of sacrificing?' (40)

"Doing no injury to living beings of the six orders, abstaining from
lying and from taking what is not freely given, renouncing property,
women, pride, and deceit, men should live under self-restraint. (41)

"He who is well protected by the five Sa*m*varas <span
id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_165.md) and is not attached to this life, who
abandons his body <span id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_166.md), who is pure and
does not care for his body, wins the great victory, the best of
offerings." (42)

'Where is your fire, your fireplace, your sacrificial ladle? where the
dried cowdung (used as fuel)? Without these things, what kind of priests
can the monks be? What oblations do you offer to the fire? (43)

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

"Penance is my fire; life my fireplace; right exertion is my sacrificial
ladle; the body the dried cowdung; Karman is my fuel; self-control,
right exertion, and tranquillity are the oblations, praised by the
sages, which I offer." (44)

'Where is your pond, and where the holy bathing-place? how do you make
your ablutions or get rid of impurity? Tell us, O restrained monk whom
the Yakshas hold in honour; we desire to learn it from you.' (45)

"The Law is my pond, celibacy my holy bathing-place, which is not
turbid, and throughout clear for the soul <span
id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_167.md); there I make ablutions; pure, clean,
and thoroughly cooled I get rid of hatred <span
id="fr_169"></span>[2](#fn_168) (or impurity). (46.md)

"The clever ones have discovered such bathing, it is the great bath
praised by the seers, in which the great seers bathe, and, pure and
clean, they obtain the highest place." (47)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_158"></span>[50:1](sbe4514.htm#fr_159.md) The commentators
relate a legend of the principal figure in the following lecture. We may
skip his former births and begin with his last. Near the Ganges lived
Balakôsh*th*a, chief of a *K*â*nd*âla tribe, called Harikê*s*a (the
yellow-haired). With his wife Gaurî he had a son Bala, who in the course
of time became a *G*aina monk and a great *Ri*shi. On his wanderings he
once stayed in the Tinduga-grove near Benares, the presiding deity of
which, a Yaksha, became his most fervent follower. One day Bhadrâ, king
Kausalika's daughter, came to the Yaksha's shrine and paid homage to the
idol. But seeing the dirty monk, she did not conceal her aversion. The
Yaksha, however, to punish her for her want of respect for the holy man,
possessed her. As no physician or conjurer could cure her madness, the
Yaksha, by whom she was possessed, said she would recover only if she
were offered as bride to Bala, the monk. The king agreeing, Bhadrâ
became sound as before and went to the monk to choose him for her
husband. Bala of course refused her. She was then married by the king to
his Purôhita, Rudradêva, whose sacrifice-enclosure is the scene of the
occurrences related in the Twelfth Lecture.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[50:2](sbe4514.htm#fr_160.md) These are the five
Samitis. Compare Bhandarkar, Report on the Search for Sanskrit
Manuscripts for 1883-84, p. 98, note †.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[50:3](sbe4514.htm#fr_161.md) These are the three
Guptis. Compare Bhandarkar, loc. cit. p. 100, note \*.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[51:1](sbe4514.htm#fr_162.md) Pi*s*â*k*a. A full
description of a Pi*s*â*k*a is given in the Uvâsaga Dasâo, § 94 of
Hoernle's edition.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[52:1](sbe4514.htm#fr_163.md) This reminds one of
the biblical parable of the sower.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[52:2](sbe4514.htm#fr_164.md) The word Nirgrantha
has here, besides its common meaning, *G*aina monk, another derived from
its etymological meaning, 'without any tie, without restraint,' i.e.
shameless.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[52:3](sbe4514.htm#fr_165.md) For Samiti and Gupti
see notes [2](#fn_159) and [3](#fn_160) on [p. 50](#page_50.md).

<span id="fn_165"></span>[55:1](sbe4514.htm#fr_166.md) Sa*m*vara is
preventing, by means of the Samitis and Guptis, the âsrava, or flowing
in of the Karman upon the soul. Bhandarkar, loc. cit. p. 106.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[55:2](sbe4514.htm#fr_167.md) This is the
Kâyôtsarga, the posture of a man standing with all his limbs immovable,
by which he fortifies himself against sins, &c.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[56:1](sbe4514.htm#fr_168.md) Attapasannalêsa =
âtmaprasannalê*s*ya, 'in which the Lê*s*yâ is favourable for the soul.'
The Lê*s*yâ is comparable to the subtile body of the orthodox
philosophy. The theory of the Lê*s*yâ forms the subject of the
Thirty-fourth Lecture.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[56:2](sbe4514.htm#fr_169.md) Dôsa, which means
hatred (dvêsha) and impurity (dôsha).
