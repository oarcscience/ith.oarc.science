## TWELFTH LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### THE CREED <span id="fr_936"></span>[2](#fn_929.md).

There are four (heretical) creeds <span id="fr_937"></span>[3](#fn_930.md)
which the disputants severally uphold: 1. the Kriyâvâda, 2. the
Akriyâvâda, 3. the Vinayavâda, and 4. the A*gñ*ânavâda. (1)

The agnostics <span id="fr_938"></span>[4](#fn_931.md), though they
(pretend to) be

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

clever, reason incoherently, and do not get beyond the confusion of
their ideas. Ignorant (teachers) speak to ignorant (pupils), and without
reflection they speak untruth. (2)

Believing truth to be untruth, and calling a bad man good, the various
upholders of Vinaya, asked about it, explain their tenet <span
id="fr_939"></span>[1](#fn_932). (3.md)

Without perceiving the truth they speak thus: this object (viz. Môksha)
is realised by us thus (viz. by Vinaya). The Akriyâvâdins who deny
Karman <span id="fr_940"></span>[2](#fn_933.md), do not admit that the
action (of the soul is transmitted to) the future moments <span
id="fr_941"></span>[3](#fn_934). (4.md)

They become involved in contradiction in their own assertions; they
falter in their speech and are unable to repeat what is said to
them <span id="fr_942"></span>[4](#fn_935). This (their opinion.md) has a
valiant counter-opinion, this (our opinion) has no valiant
counter-opinion; and Karman has six sources <span
id="fr_943"></span>[5](#fn_936). (5.md)

The Akriyâvâdins who do not understand the truth, bring forward various
opinions; many men

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

believing in them will whirl round in the endless Circle of Births. (6)

'There rises no sun, nor does it set; there waxes no moon, nor does it
wane; there are no rivers running, nor any winds blowing; the whole
world is ascertained to be unreal <span
id="fr_944"></span>[1](#fn_937).' (7.md)

As a blind man, though he have a light, does not see colours, &c.,
because he is deprived of his eye(sight), so the Akriyâvâdin, having a
perverted intellect, does not recognise the action (of the soul) though
it does exist. (8)

Many men in this world who have studied astrology, the art of
interpreting dreams, divination from diagrams, augury, divination from
bodily marks, and from portents, and the eight branches (of divination
from omens), know the future <span id="fr_945"></span>[2](#fn_938). (9.md)

(The opponents say that) some forecasts are true, and the prophecies of
others prove wrong; therefore they do not study those sciences, but they
profess to know the world, fools though they be <span
id="fr_946"></span>[3](#fn_939). (10.md)

The (Kriyâvâdins) *S*rama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as understanding the world
(according to their lights), speak thus: misery is produced by one's own
works, not by those of somebody else (viz. fate, creator, &c.) <span
id="fr_947"></span>[4](#fn_940.md). But right knowledge and conduct lead to
liberation. (11)

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

The (Tîrthakaras), being (as it were) the eyes of the world and its
leaders, teach the path which is salutary to men; they have declared
that the world is eternal inasmuch as creatures are (for ever) living in
it, O ye men! (12)

The Râkshasas and the dwellers in Yama's world, the troops <span
id="fr_948"></span>[1](#fn_941.md) of Asuras and Gandharvas, and the
spirits that walk the air, and individual beings <span
id="fr_949"></span>[2](#fn_942.md): they will all be born again and again.
(13)

(The Sa*m*sâra) which is compared to the boundless flood of water, know
it to be impassable and of very long duration on account of repeated
births <span id="fr_950"></span>[3](#fn_943.md). Men therein, seduced by
their senses and by women, are born again and again both (as movable and
immovable beings). (14)

The sinners cannot annihilate their works by new works; the pious
annihilate their works by abstention from works; the wise and happy men
who got rid of the effects of greed, do not commit sins. (15)

They know the past, present, and future ways of the world; they are
leaders of other men, but follow no leader; they are awakened, and put
an end to mundane existence. (16)

Averse to injury of living beings, they do not act, nor cause others to
act. Always restraining themselves,

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

those pious men practise control, and some become heroes through their
knowledge. (17) He regards small beings and large beings, the whole
world as equal to himself; he comprehends the immense world, and being
awakened he controls himself among the careless. (18)

Those who have learned (the truth) by themselves or from others, are
able (to save) themselves and others. One should always honour a man,
who is like a light and makes manifest the Law after having well
considered it. (19)

He who knows himself and the world; who knows where (the creatures) go,
and whence they will not return; who knows what is eternal, and what is
transient; birth and death, and the future existences of men; (20)

He who knows the tortures of beings below (i.e. in hell); who knows the
influx of sin and its stoppage <span id="fr_951"></span>[1](#fn_944.md);
who knows misery and its annihilation,--he is entitled to expound the
Kriyâvâda <span id="fr_952"></span>[2](#fn_945), (21.md)

Being not attached to sounds and colours, indifferent to tastes and
smells, not desiring life nor death, guarded by control, and exempt from
the Circle (of Births). (22)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_929"></span>[315:2](sbe4560.htm#fr_936.md) Samôsara*n*a =
samavasara*n*a. This word and the verb samôsarai are commonly used when
Mahâvîra preaches to a meeting (mêlâpaka) gathered round him.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[315:3](sbe4560.htm#fr_937.md) Compare
Uttarâdhyayana XVIII, 23, above p. 83, note 2.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[315:4](sbe4560.htm#fr_938.md) Annâ*n*iyâ =
a*gñ*ânikâs, the followers of the fourth sect.

<span id="fn_932"></span>[316:1](sbe4560.htm#fr_939.md) Viz. that Môksha is
arrived at through Vinaya, discipline.

<span id="fn_933"></span>[316:2](sbe4560.htm#fr_940.md) Lavâvasaṅkî. Lava
is explained by karman, and avasaṅkî by apasartu*m* *s*îla*m* yêshâ*m*
tê.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[316:3](sbe4560.htm#fr_941.md) The meaning is that
as everything has but a momentary existence, there is no connection
between the thing as it is now, and as it will be in the next moment.
This is a doctrine of the Bauddhas. But the Sâṅkhyas are also reckoned
among the Akriyâvâdins, because, according to them, the âtman does not
act.

<span id="fn_935"></span>[316:4](sbe4560.htm#fr_942.md) *S*îlâṅka in
commenting upon this passage has to say a good deal about the Bauddhas.
It is perhaps of interest that he mentions their 500 *G*âtakas, and not
thirty-four which is the recognised number of Gâtakas according to the
Northern Buddhist. How *S*îlâṅka came to a knowledge of the numbers of
*G*âtakas accepted by the Southern Buddhists, I cannot tell.

<span id="fn_936"></span>[316:5](sbe4560.htm#fr_943.md) Viz. the six
Âsravas.

<span id="fn_937"></span>[317:1](sbe4560.htm#fr_944.md) This is the opinion
of the *S*ûnyavâdins, who are considered to belong to the Akriyâvâdins,
because they deny all actions, even such as are perceived by everybody
(*S*îlâṅka).

<span id="fn_938"></span>[317:2](sbe4560.htm#fr_945.md) This would be
impossible if the whole world was unreal.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[317:3](sbe4560.htm#fr_946.md) A various reading,
commented upon by the scholiasts, runs thus: âha*m*su vi*gg*âpalimokkham
êva, they say 'that one must give up science.'

<span id="fn_940"></span>[317:4](sbe4560.htm#fr_947.md) The Kriyâvâdins
contend, according to *S*îlâṅka, that works alone, by themselves,
without knowledge, lead to Môksha.

<span id="fn_941"></span>[318:1](sbe4560.htm#fr_948.md) Kâya. The
commentators explain this word as denoting the earth-bodies, &c., but
from the context it will be seen that it refers to Asuras and
Gandharvas, and must be translated by 'troops.'

<span id="fn_942"></span>[318:2](sbe4560.htm#fr_949.md) Pu*dh*ô siyâ =
p*ri*thak *s*ritâ*h*; according to *S*îlâṅka, p*ri*thivyâ*s*ritâ*h*.
This expression is generally used to denote the lower order of beings.

<span id="fn_943"></span>[318:3](sbe4560.htm#fr_950.md) To render
bhavagahana.

<span id="fn_944"></span>[319:1](sbe4560.htm#fr_951.md) Âsrava and
sa*m*vara.

<span id="fn_945"></span>[319:2](sbe4560.htm#fr_952.md) It is evident that
the *G*ainas considered themselves Kriyâvâdins. I had overlooked this
passage when penning the note on [p. 83](sbe4520.htm#page_83.md).
