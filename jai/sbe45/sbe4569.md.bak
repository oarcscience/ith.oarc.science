## FIFTH LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### FREEDOM FROM ERROR.

A very clever (monk) who practises the vow of chastity, should not adopt
the following (heretical) doctrines, nor behave badly in this religion.
(1)

He should not believe that (this world) is without beginning or without
end, eternal or not eternal, according to the argumentation (of
heretics) <span id="fr_1194"></span>[1](#fn_1184). (2.md) From these
alternatives you cannot arrive at

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

truth; from these alternatives you are, certainly, led to error. (3)

One should not say: that there will be an end of beings who (know and)
teach the truth <span id="fr_1195"></span>[1](#fn_1185.md); nor that all
beings are not alike, nor that they shall be in (perpetual) bondage, or
(that the prophets are) eternal. (4)

From these alternatives you cannot arrive at the truth, &c. (see verse
3). (5)

One should not say: the guilt of killing small and great animals is the
same, or not the same. (6) From these alternatives, &c. (7)

One should know that those who accept things especially prepared for
them <span id="fr_1196"></span>[2](#fn_1186.md), will be affected by
demerit (in some cases), or will not be affected (where it is allowed by
scripture). (8)

From these alternatives, &c. (9)

One should not maintain the identity of the audârika <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[3](#fn_1187.md), âhârika, and kârma*n*a bodies, nor

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

that everything cannot everywhere come into existence <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[1](#fn_1188), nor that it can. (10.md)

From these alternatives, &c. (11)

Do not maintain that the world does not exist, maintain that it exists.
(12)

Do not maintain that *G*îva and A*g*îva do not exist, but that they
exist. (13)

Do not maintain that Dharma and Adharma do not exist, but that they
exist. (14)

Do not maintain that bondage and liberation do not exist, but that they
exist. (15)

Do not maintain that virtue and vice <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[2](#fn_1189.md) do not exist, but that they exist.
(16)

Do not maintain that Âsrava and the stoppage of Âsrava do not exist, but
that they exist. (17)

Do not maintain that the experiencing of the effect, and the
annihilation of Karman do not exist, but that they exist. (18)

Do not maintain that activity and non-activity do not exist, but that
they exist. (19)

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

Do not maintain that anger and pride do not exist, but that they exist.
(20)

Do not maintain that deceit and greed do not exist, but that they exist.
(21)

Do not maintain that love and hate do not exist, but that they exist.
(22)

Do not maintain that the fourfold Circle of Births does not exist, but
that it exists. (23)

Do not maintain that there are no gods and goddesses, but that there
are. (24)

Do not maintain that there is no such thing as perfection and
non-perfection, but that there is such a thing. (25)

Do not maintain that there is no place exclusively reserved for those
who attain to perfection, but that there is such <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[1](#fn_1190). (26.md)

Do not maintain that there are no pious and wicked men, but that there
are. (27)

Do not maintain that there is no such thing as good and bad, but that
there is good and bad. (28)

The theory will not work that (a man is always) good, or (always) bad.
The wrongly instructed *S*rama*n*as do not comprehend the (soul's)
bondage <span id="fr_1201"></span>[2](#fn_1191) (through Karman). (29.md)

(Do not assert) that everything is imperishable, or full of pains, nor
that criminals should be put to death or not be put to death; one should
not speak in this way. (30)

Do not assert that those men are well-behaved monks who lead a pure
life, and that those others lead an impure life. (31)

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

A wise monk should not say: we get alms (from this householder) or we do
not; but he should improve his chances for final liberation <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[1](#fn_1192). (32.md)

A monk should conform himself to these opinions taught by the *G*inas,
and wander about till he reaches final liberation. (33)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1184"></span>[405:1](sbe4569.htm#fr_1194.md) The *G*ainas
decide all such questions with the help of the syâdvâda, which in an
admirable way removes all difficulties; e.g. the world is eternal as far
as that part is concerned which is <span id="page_406">p. 406</span> the
substratum of the idea (sâmânya) 'world'; it is not eternal as far as
its ever-changing state is meant.

<span id="fn_1185"></span>[406:1](sbe4569.htm#fr_1195.md) *S*âstâra*h*,
teachers, here those who reach perfection. The meaning is that the world
would become empty if all beings should reach perfection. This should
not he maintained, nor the opposite opinion, that some beings are
qualified for Nirvâ*n*a and others not.

<span id="fn_1186"></span>[406:2](sbe4569.htm#fr_1196.md) Ahâkammâ*n*i, see
[p. 131](sbe4526.htm#page_131), note [7](sbe4526.htm#fn_337.md).

<span id="fn_1187"></span>[406:3](sbe4569.htm#fr_1197.md) The *G*ainas
assume that each individual possesses five bodies: (1) audârika, or the
body that is seen; (2) kârma*n*a, receptacle of Karman, it is composed
of Karman particles; (3) tai*g*asa, a body composed of particles of
fire, it causes digestion; (4) âhâraka, a subtile body of the soul, with
which he goes to distant places (e.g. when a *k*aturda*s*apûrvin goes to
the Kêvalin to clear up some doubt); (5) vaikriya, a subtile body which
can be changed at will. All these 'bodies,' except the first, are what
in common language are called spirits or souls. We have here a Hindu
counterpart of the belief in the plurality of souls shared <span
id="page_407">p. 407</span> by many ancient and modern nations. Compare
the following verses quoted in Tylor, Origin of Culture, Chapter XI:

'Bis duo sunt homini, manes, caro, spiritus, umbra:  
   Quattuor haec loci bis duo suscipiunt.  
Terra tegit carnem, tumulum circumvolution umbra  
   Manes Orcus habet, spiritus astra petit.'

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I am inclined to
believe that the idea of the âhâraka and vaikriya *s*arîras is developed
from the popular belief that the soul in sleep leaves the body and
travels far away. Compare also the Sâṅkhya terms vaik*ri*ta and
tai*g*asa, Garbe, Die Sâ*m*khya-Philosophie, pp. 236, 249.

<span id="fn_1188"></span>[407:1](sbe4569.htm#fr_1198.md) According to the
commentator this is said against the Sâṅkhya philosophy, for as
everything is an effect of Prak*ri*ti, and Prak*ri*ti is present
everywhere, everything may come into existence everywhere.

<span id="fn_1189"></span>[407:2](sbe4569.htm#fr_1199.md) Pu*n*yam and
pâpam. The one is the good Karman (*s*ubham karmapudgalam); the other,
the bad.

<span id="fn_1190"></span>[408:1](sbe4569.htm#fr_1200.md) See
Uttarâdhyayana XXXVI, 62, 63, p. 212.

<span id="fn_1191"></span>[408:2](sbe4569.htm#fr_1201.md) Vêra = vaira,
explained karmabandha.

<span id="fn_1192"></span>[409:1](sbe4569.htm#fr_1202.md) Santimagga*m*
*k*a vûhaê = *s*ântimârga*m* *k*a v*rim*hayêt.
