### TENTH LECTURE <span id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_140.md).

###### THE LEAF OF THE TREE.

As the fallow leaf of the tree falls to the ground, when its days are
gone, even so the life of men (will

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

come to its close); Gautama, be careful all the while! (1)

As a dew-drop dangling on the top of a blade of Ku*s*a-grass lasts but a
short time, even so the life of men; Gautama, be careful all the while!
(2)

As life is so fleet and existence so precarious, wipe off the sins you
ever committed; Gautama, &c. (3)

A rare chance, in the long course of time, is human birth for a living
being; hard are the consequences of actions; Gautama, &c. (4)

When the soul has once got into an earth-body <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_141.md), it may remain in the same state as long
as an Asa*m*khya <span id="fr_143"></span>[2](#fn_142); Gautama, &c. (5.md)

When the soul has once got into a water-body, &c. (all as in verse 5).
(6)

When a soul has once got into a fire-body, &c. (all as in verse 5). (7)

When the soul has once got into a wind-body, &c. (all as in verse 5).
(8)

When the soul has once got into a vegetable-body, it remains long in
that state, for an endless time, after which its lot is not much
bettered <span id="fr_144"></span>[3](#fn_143); Gautama, &c. (9.md)

When the soul has once got into a body of a Dvîndriya (i.e. a being
possessing two organs of

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

sense), it may remain in the same state as long as a period called
sa*m*khyêya <span id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_144); Gautama, &c. (10.md)

When the soul has once got into a body of a Trîndriya (i.e. a being
possessing three organs of sense), it, &c. (all as in verse 10). (11)

When the soul has once got into a body of a *K*aturindriya (i.e. a being
possessing four organs of sense), it, &c. (all as in verse 10). (12)

When the soul has once got into a body of a Pa*ñk*êndriya (i.e. a being
possessing five organs of sense), it may remain in the same state as
long as seven or eight births; Gautama, &c. (13)

When the soul has once got into the body of a god or of a denizen of
hell, it may remain in that state one whole life; Gautama, &c. (14)

Thus the soul which suffers for its carelessness, is driven about in the
Sa*m*sâra by its good and bad Karman; Gautama, &c. (15)

Though one be born as a man, it is a rare chance to become an Ârya; for
many are the Dasyus and Mlê*kkh*as; Gautama, &c. (16)

Though one be born as an Ârya, it is a rare chance to possess all five
organs of sense; for we see many who lack one organ or other; Gautama,
&c. (17)

Though he may possess all five organs of sense, still it is a rare
chance to be instructed in the best Law; for people follow heretical
teachers; Gautama, &c. (18)

Though he may have been instructed in the right Law, still it is a rare
chance to believe in it; for many people are heretics; Gautama, &c. (19)

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

Though one believe in the Law, he will rarely practise it; for people
are engrossed by pleasures; Gautama, &c. (20)

When your body grows old, and your hair turns white, the power of your
ears decreases; Gautama, &c. (21)

When your body grows old, and your hair turns white, the power of your
eyes decreases; Gautama, &c. (22)

When your body grows old, and your hair turns white, the power of your
nose decreases. (23)

When your body grows old, and your hair turns white, the power of your
tongue decreases. (24)

When your body grows old, and your hair turns white, the power of your
touch decreases. (25)

When your body grows old, and your hair turns white, all your powers
decrease. (26)

Despondency, the king's evil, cholera, mortal diseases of many kinds
befall you; your body wastes and decays; Gautama, &c. (27)

Cast aside from you all attachments, as the (leaves of) a lotus let drop
off the autumnal <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_145.md) water, exempt
from every attachment, Gautama, be careful all the while! (28)

Give up your wealth and your wife; you have entered the state of the
houseless; do not, as it were, return to your vomit; Gautama, &c. (29)

Leave your friends and relations, the large fortune you have amassed; do
not desire them a second time; Gautama, &c. (30)

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

There is now no *G*ina <span id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_146.md), but there
is a highly esteemed guide to show the way; now being on the right path,
Gautama, be careful all the while! (31)

Now you have entered on the path from which the thorns have been
cleared, the great path; walk in the right path; Gautama, &c. (32)

Do not get into an uneven road like a weak burden-bearer; for you will
repent of it afterwards; Gautama, &c. (33)

You have crossed the great ocean; why do you halt so near the shore?
make haste to get on the other side; Gautama, &c. (34)

Going through the same religious practices as perfected saints <span
id="fr_148"></span>[2](#fn_147.md), you will reach the world of perfection,
Gautama, where there is safety and perfect happiness; Gautama, &c. (35)

The enlightened <span id="fr_149"></span>[3](#fn_148.md) and liberated monk
should control himself, whether he be in a village or a town, and he
should preach to all <span id="fr_150"></span>[4](#fn_149.md) the road of
peace; Gautama, &c. (36)

Having heard the Buddha's <span id="fr_151"></span>[5](#fn_150.md)
well-delivered

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

sermon, adorned by illustrations, Gautama cut off love and hatred and
reached perfection. (37) Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_140"></span>[41:2](sbe4512.htm#fr_141.md) This is a sermon
delivered by Mahâvîra to his disciple Indrabhûti, who belonged to the
Gôtama Gôtra. In the commentary a lengthy legend is given how Gautama
came to want this instruction. As it is not necessary for understanding
the contents of this lecture, I may pass it over.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[42:1](sbe4512.htm#fr_142.md) Verses 5-9 treat of
the êkêndriyas or beings which possess but one organ of sense, that of
touch. A full description of them as well as of the dvîndriyas, &c. is
given in the last lecture.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[42:2](sbe4512.htm#fr_143.md) The periods called
asa*m*khya are measured by utsarpi*n*îs and avasarpi*n*îs which
correspond to the kalpas of the Hindus, but greatly exaggerated. An
asa*m*khya is the longest time (ukkôsa*m* = utkarsha*m*) which a soul
may be doomed to live in earth-bodies; see below, XXXVI, 81 ff.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[42:3](sbe4512.htm#fr_144.md) This is, according
to the commentary, the meaning of duranta.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[43:1](sbe4512.htm#fr_145.md) A sa*m*khi*gg*a,
i.e. sa*m*khyêya, is a period which can be measured by thousands of
years.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[44:1](sbe4512.htm#fr_146.md) This attribute is
here given to 'water,' because in autumn the water becomes pure, and
even the purest water has no hold upon the leaves of a lotus; thus a
saint should give up even the best and dearest attachment.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[45:1](sbe4512.htm#fr_147.md) As this assertion
cannot be put in the mouth of Mahâvîra, this verse must be set down as a
later addition--or perhaps as a blunder of the poet similar to that
noted before, in IX, 42.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[45:2](sbe4512.htm#fr_148.md) This seems,
according to the commentary, to be the meaning of the phrase
akalêvarasê*n*im ûsiyâ. Akalêvara*s*rê*n*î is said to mean as much as
kshapaka*s*rê*n*î.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[45:3](sbe4512.htm#fr_149.md) Buddha.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[45:4](sbe4512.htm#fr_150.md) Bûhaê = v*rim*hayêt;
literally, propagate.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[45:5](sbe4512.htm#fr_151.md) Here the word b u d
d h a is used as a title; but its use is very restricted, scarcely going
beyond that of a common epithet. This is just what we otherwise should
have to assume in order to explain the use by the Bauddhas of that word
to denote the founder of their sect. In the Sûtrak*ri*tâṅga II, 6, 28
Buddha, in the plural, actually denotes the prophets of the Buddhists.
