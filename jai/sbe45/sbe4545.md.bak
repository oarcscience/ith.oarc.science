### THIRD CHAPTER.

If a monk who abstains from actions, suffers pain (for acts done)
through ignorance, that Karman will

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

be annihilated through control. The wise reach (perfection) getting rid
of death. (1)

Those who resist the seductions <span id="fr_761"></span>[1](#fn_755.md)
are placed on a line with those who have crossed the Sa*m*sâra.
Therefore look up (at beatitude as the end in view). Those (virtuous
men) regard pleasures as equal to diseases. (2)

Men of princely rank wear precious things imported by merchants; likened
(to these precious things) are the excellent great vows together with
(the prohibition of) eating at night. (3)

Pleasure-seeking men who are greedy and are absorbed by amusements, are
reckless and like the wretched; they do not know that meditation (has
been enjoined as) a duty. (4)

As a bullock which is hurt and urged on by the driver <span
id="fr_762"></span>[2](#fn_756.md) becomes weak, and at last, when its
strength is exhausted and it is unable to move, sinks down; (5)

So he who knows the pursuit of pleasures, must sooner or later give up
their enjoyment (lest they drag him down <span
id="fr_763"></span>[3](#fn_757).md). He who is still surrounded by pleasant
things <span id="fr_764"></span>[4](#fn_758.md), should not love pleasures,
whether he obtains them, or for some reason or other does not obtain
them. (6)

Lest the lot of the wicked should fall to you, escape (the influence of
the senses), and discipline yourself! The wicked will much and strongly
grieve, groan, and wail. (7)

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

See, life in this world (is transient); though your life lasts a hundred
years, you die as a short-lived man; mind that (your) years swiftly
pass. Nevertheless greedy men are attached to pleasures. (8)

Those who engage in undertakings, who work the perdition of their souls,
and who kill (living beings), will go to the world of the wicked, to the
abode of the Asuras for a long time (to dwell there). (9)

Though life cannot be prolonged, as the saying is <span
id="fr_765"></span>[1](#fn_759.md), still foolish people sin recklessly
(thinking): 'We are only concerned with the present time; who has seen
the next world and returned thence?' (10)

Believe in the words of him who sees (everything), you who are blind, as
it were, you whose sight is blinded, ah, whose sight is obstructed by
your works which result in delusion! (11)

The unhappy again and again suffer from delusion; therefore have done
with praise and honours! A wise ascetic should consider that living
beings are like himself (as regards love of life, aversion to pain,
&c.). (12)

The man also who still lives in the house, should, in accordance with
his creed <span id="fr_766"></span>[2](#fn_760.md), be merciful to living
beings; we are bidden to be fair and equal with all; (thereby even a
householder) goes to the world of the gods. (13)

Being instructed in the creed of the Lord, exert yourself in the truth
(i.e. in control)! A monk who has thoroughly subdued his selfishness
should collect pure alms. (14)

Knowing the truth, one should live up to it,

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

seeking the Law, earnest in the performance of austerities, possessing
the Guptis, being accomplished, one should always exert oneself, intent
on the soul's benefit, and desiring the highest good (viz. liberation).
(15)

The fool thinks that his wealth, cattle, and relations will save him;
they him, or he them. But they are no help, no protection. (16)

When calamity befalls him, or the end of his life draws near, he must go
and come alone; the wise believe that there is nothing to protect him.
(17)

All living beings owe their present form of existence to their own
Karman; timid, wicked, suffering latent misery, they err about (in the
Circle of Births), subject to birth, old age, and death. (18)

He should know that the present time is the best opportunity to mend,
and that an awakening is difficult to obtain. A wise man should be aware
of this <span id="fr_767"></span>[1](#fn_761). The (first.md) *G*ina <span
id="fr_768"></span>[2](#fn_762.md) has said this, and so the remaining ones
(will) say it. (19)

O ye monks, the virtuous (*G*inas) that have been and will be, the
followers of the Law of Kâ*s*yapa <span id="fr_769"></span>[3](#fn_763.md),
they all have commended these virtues. (20)

Do not kill living beings in the threefold way <span
id="fr_770"></span>[4](#fn_764.md), being intent on your spiritual welfare
and abstaining from sins. In this way numberless men have reached

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

perfection, and others, who live now, and who are to come, (will reach
it). (21)

Thus spoke the Arhat G*ñ*ât*ri*putra, the reverend, famous native of
Vai*s*âlî <span id="fr_771"></span>[1](#fn_765.md), who possessed the
highest knowledge and the highest faith, who possessed (simultaneously)
the highest knowledge and faith.

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_755"></span>[258:1](sbe4545.htm#fr_761.md) Vinnava*n*â =
vi*gñ*âpanâ, explained striya*h*.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[258:2](sbe4545.htm#fr_762.md) Instead of 'driver'
and 'bullock' we might translate 'hunter' and 'deer.'

<span id="fn_757"></span>[258:3](sbe4545.htm#fr_763.md) He should not be
engrossed by them as the bullock sinks down beneath its burden.

<span id="fn_758"></span>[258:4](sbe4545.htm#fr_764.md) To render kâmî.

<span id="fn_759"></span>[259:1](sbe4545.htm#fr_765.md) Compare [p.
256](sbe4544.htm#page_256), note [1](sbe4544.htm#fn_744.md).

<span id="fn_760"></span>[259:2](sbe4545.htm#fr_766.md) Ânupûrvyâ.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[260:1](sbe4545.htm#fr_767.md) A various reading
mentioned in the commentary is ahiyâsaê, 'he should bear (all
troubles).'

<span id="fn_762"></span>[260:2](sbe4545.htm#fr_768.md) The whole lecture
is put by the commentators in the mouth of *Ri*shabha.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[260:3](sbe4545.htm#fr_769.md) The first and last
Tîrthakaras belonged to the Kâ*s*yapa Gôtra.

<span id="fn_764"></span>[260:4](sbe4545.htm#fr_770.md) I.e. by your own
acts, by order, and by assent; or by thoughts, words, and acts.

<span id="fn_765"></span>[261:1](sbe4545.htm#fr_771.md) See my remarks in
part i, Introduction, p. xi. This passage in prose appended to the
metrical text seems to contradict the supposition of the commentators
that the whole lecture was pronounced by *Ri*shabha.
