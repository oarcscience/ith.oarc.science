### NINTH LECTURE.

###### THE PRAVRA*G*YÂ OF KING NAMI <span id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_130.md).

After (Nami) had descended from the world of the gods, and had been born
as a man, he put an end to the influence of delusion, and remembered his
former birth. (1)

Remembering his former birth, king Nami

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

became a Svaya*m*sa*m*buddha in the true Law, and placing his son on the
throne he retired from the world. (2)

After having enjoyed, in the company of the beautiful ladies of his
seraglio, excellent pleasures which match those of the heavens, king
Nami became enlightened and gave up his pleasures. (3)

Having given up the town and country of Mithilâ, his army, seraglio, and
all his retinue, the venerable man retired from the world and resorted
to a lonely place. (4)

When the royal Seer Nami retired from the world, at the occasion of his
Pravra*g*yâ there was an uproar in Mithilâ. (5)

To the royal Seer who had reached the excellent stage of Pravra*g*yâ,
*S*akra in the guise of a Brâhma*n*a addressed the following words: (6)

'Why is now Mithilâ <span id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_131.md) full of
uproar? Dreadful noises are heard from palaces and houses.' (7)

On hearing this, the royal Seer Nami, pursuing his reasons and
arguments, answered the king of the gods thus: (8)

'In Mithilâ is the sacred <span id="fr_133"></span>[2](#fn_132.md) tree
Manôrama, full of leaves, flowers, and fruits, which sheds a cool
shadow; this tree is always a favourite resort of many (birds). (9)

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

'Now, as this sacred tree Manôrama is shaken by the storm, the birds,
suffering, destitute of refuge, and miserable, scream aloud.' (10)

On hearing this, the king of gods, pursuing his reasons and arguments,
answered the royal Seer Nami thus: (11)

"This is fire and storm, your palace is on fire! Reverend sir, why do
you not look after your seraglio?" (12)

Nami answered (see verse 8): (13)

'Happy are we, happy live we who call nothing our own; when Mithilâ is
on fire, nothing is burned that belongs to me. (14)

To a monk who has left his sons and wives, and who has ceased to act,
nothing pleasant can occur, nor anything unpleasant. (15)

'There is much happiness for the sage, for the houseless monk, who is
free from all ties, and knows himself to be single and unconnected (with
the rest of the world).' (16)

Indra answered (see verse 11): (17)

"Erect a wall, gates, and battlements; dig a moat; construct
*s*ataghnîs <span id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_133.md): then you will
be <span id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_134) a Kshattriya." (18.md)

Nami answered (see verse 8): (19)

'Making Faith his fortress, Penance and Self-control the bolt (of its
gate), Patience its strong wall, so that guarded in three ways <span
id="fr_136"></span>[3](#fn_135.md) it is impregnable; making Zeal his bow,
its string Carefulness in walking (iriyâ), and its top (where the string
is

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

fastened) Content, he should bend (this bow) with Truth, piercing with
the arrow, Penance, (the foe's) mail, Karman--(in this way) a sage will
be the victor in battle and get rid of the Sa*m*sâra.' (20-22)

Indra answered (see verse 11): (23)

"Build palaces, excellent houses <span id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_136.md),
and turrets; thus you will be a Kshattriya." (24)

Nami answered (see verse 8): (25)

'He who builds his house on the road, will certainly get into trouble;
wherever he wants to go, there he may take up his lodgings.' (26)

Indra answered (see verse 11): (27)

"Punishing thieves and robbers, cut-purses and burglars, you should
establish public safety; thus you will be a Kshattriya." (28)

Nami answered (see verse 8): (29)

'Men frequently apply punishment wrongly: the innocent are put in
prison, and the perpetrator of the crime is set at liberty.' (30)

Indra answered (see verse 11): (31)

"O king, bring into subjection all princes who do not acknowledge you;
thus you will be a true Kshattriya." (32)

Nami answered (see verse 8): (33)

'Though a man should conquer thousands and thousands of valiant (foes),
greater will be his victory if he conquers nobody but himself. (34)

'Fight with your Self; why fight with external foes? He who conquers
himself through himself, will obtain happiness. (35)

'The five senses, anger, pride, delusion, and greed

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --difficult to
conquer is one's self; but when that is conquered, everything is
conquered <span id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_137).' (36.md)

Indra answered (see verse 11): (37)

"Offer great sacrifices, feed *S*rama*n*as and Brâhma*n*as, give alms,
enjoy yourself, and offer sacrifices: thus you will be a true
Kshattriya." (38)

Nami answered: (39)

'Though a man should give, every month, thousands and thousands of cows,
better will be he who controls himself, though he give no alms.' (40)

Indra answered: (41)

"You have left the dreadful â*s*rama (that of the householder) <span
id="fr_139"></span>[2](#fn_138.md) and are wanting to enter another;
(remain what you were), O king, and be content with observing the
Pôsaha-days." (42)

Nami answered: (43)

'If an ignorant man should eat but a blade of Ku*s*a-grass every month,
(the merit of his penance) will not equal the sixteenth part of his who
possesses the Law as it has been taught.' (44)

Indra answered: (45)

"Multiply your gold and silver, your jewels and

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

pearls, your copper, fine robes, and carriages, and your treasury; then
you will be a true Kshattriya." (46)

Nami answered: (47)

'If there were numberless mountains of gold and silver, as big as
Kailâsa, they would not satisfy a greedy man; for his avidity is
boundless like space. (48)

'Knowing that the earth with its crops of rice and barley, with its gold
and cattle, that all this put together will not satisfy one single man,
one should practise austerities.' (49)

Indra answered: (50)

"A miracle! O king, you give up those wonderful pleasures, in search of
imaginary objects; your very hope will cause your ruin." (51)

Nami answered: (52)

'Pleasures are the thorn that rankles, pleasures are poison, pleasures
are like a venomous snake; he who is desirous of pleasures will not get
them, and will come to a bad end at last. (53)

'He will sink through anger; he will go down through pride; delusion
will block up his path; through greed he will incur dangers in both
worlds.' (54)

Throwing off the guise of a Brâhma*n*a, and making visible his true
form, *S*akra saluted him respectfully and praised him with these sweet
words: (55)

"Bravo! you have conquered anger; bravo! you have vanquished pride;
bravo! you have banished delusion; bravo! you have subdued greed. (56)

"Bravo for your simplicity, O saint! bravo for your humility, O saint!
bravo for your perfect patience! bravo for your perfect liberation! (57)

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

"Here (on earth) you are the highest man, Reverend sir, and hereafter
you will be the highest; exempt from all blemishes you will reach
Perfection, a higher state than which there is none in this world." (58)

Thus praising the royal Seer, *S*akra in perfect faith kept his right
side towards him and paid reverence to him, again and again. (59)

After having adored the best sage's feet marked by the *K*akra and the
Aṅku*s*a <span id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_139.md), he flew up through the
air, with his crown and his earrings prettily trembling. (60)

Nami humbled himself; enjoined by *S*akra in person, the king of Vidêha
left the house, and took upon him *S*rama*n*ahood. (61)

Thus act the enlightened, the wise, the clever ones; they turn away from
pleasures, as did Nami, the royal Seer. (62)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_130"></span>[35:2](sbe4511.htm#fr_131.md) The Life of king
Nami and his Bôdhi is told in the commentary. The Prâk*ri*t text of this
romance is printed in my 'Ausgewählte Erzählungen in Mâhârâsh*t*rî,'
Leipzig, 1886, p. 41 ff. Nami is one of the four simultaneous
Pratyêkabuddhas, i.e. one of those saints who reach the highest stage of
knowledge by an effort of their own, not through regular instruction and
religious discipline. The Pratyêkabuddhas or Svaya*m*sa*m*buddhas
(Sahasambuddha in Prâk*ri*t) do not, however, propagate the true Law, as
the Tîrthakaras do. As the legend of Nami is not materially connected
with our text, I need not give an abstract of it here.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[36:1](sbe4511.htm#fr_132.md) The text has
Mahilâê, which is against the metre. The locative makes the construction
needlessly involved.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[36:2](sbe4511.htm#fr_133.md) *K*êiê, *k*aitya.
The commentator interprets it as meaning udyâna, park; but to make good
his interpretation he takes va*kkh*ê for an instrumental plural instead
of a nominative singular. The context itself seems to militate against
this interpretation; for it is natural to say of a tree that it has many
leaves, but it is rather strained to say the same of a park.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[37:1](sbe4511.htm#fr_134.md) An instrument for
defending a town.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[37:2](sbe4511.htm#fr_135.md) Ga*kkh*asi. The
commentator explains this as an imperative, but there is no necessity
for it.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[37:3](sbe4511.htm#fr_136.md) Tigutta, this is a
pun on the three guptis.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[38:1](sbe4511.htm#fr_137.md) Vardhamânag*ri*ha;
the houses which are so called, belong to the best kind, see Varâha
Mihira, B*ri*hat Sa*m*hitâ 53, 36.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[39:1](sbe4511.htm#fr_138.md) The first line of
this verse is in the Âryâ-metre, the second in Anush*t*ubh; the whole
will not construe, but the meaning is clear. There are numerous
instances in which the metre changes in the same stanza from Âryâ to
Anush*t*ubh, and vice versa, so frequent they are that we are forced to
admit the fact that the authors of these metrical texts did not shrink
from taking such liberties.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[39:2](sbe4511.htm#fr_139.md) Ghôrâsama. A *G*aina
author cannot forbear to name things from his religious point of looking
at them. Thus only can it be explained that here Indra is made to apply
to the â*s*rama of the householder an attribute which not he but his
opponent could have used. Our verse is, however, probably only a later
addition, as it has not the burden of the verses put into the mouth of
Indra.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[41:1](sbe4511.htm#fr_140.md) The wheel and the
hook.
