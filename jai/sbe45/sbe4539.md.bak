# SÛTRAK*RI*TÂṄGA.

## FIRST BOOK <span id="fr_674"></span>[1](#fn_670.md).

## FIRST LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### THE DOCTRINE <span id="fr_675"></span>[2](#fn_671.md).

### FIRST CHAPTER.

One should know what causes the bondage of Soul, and knowing (it) one
should remove <span id="fr_676"></span>[3](#fn_672.md) it.

(*G*ambûsvâmin asked Sudharman):

What causes the bondage (of Soul) according to Mahâvîra? and what must
one know in order to remove it? (1)

(Sudharman answered):

He who owns even a small property in living or lifeless things <span
id="fr_677"></span>[4](#fn_673.md), or consents to others holding it, will
not be delivered from misery. (2)

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

If a man kills living beings, or causes other men to kill them, or
consents to their killing them, his iniquity will go on increasing. (3)

A sinner who makes the interests of his kinsmen <span
id="fr_678"></span>[1](#fn_674.md) and companions his own, will suffer
much; for the number of those whose interest he takes to heart
constantly increases. (4)

All this, his wealth and his nearest relations, cannot protect him (from
future misery); knowing (this) and (the value of) life, he will get rid
of Karman. (5)

Some men <span id="fr_679"></span>[2](#fn_675.md), *S*rama*n*as and
Brâhma*n*as, who ignore and deny these true words <span
id="fr_680"></span>[3](#fn_676), adhere (to their own tenets.md), and are
given to pleasures. (6)

Some <span id="fr_681"></span>[4](#fn_677.md) profess (the exclusive belief
in) the five gross elements: earth, water, fire, wind, and air. (7)

'These five gross elements (are the original causes of things), from
them arises another (thing, viz. âtman) <span
id="fr_682"></span>[5](#fn_678.md); for on the dissolution of the (five
elements) living beings cease to exist. (8)

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

'And as the Earth, though it is but one pile, presents many forms, so
the intelligent (principle, viz. the âtman) appears under various forms
as the universe <span id="fr_683"></span>[1](#fn_679).' (9.md)

Thus say some fools. (But how can they explain on their theory that) the
man engaging in undertakings, who has committed a sin, will himself
suffer severe pain. <span id="fr_684"></span>[2](#fn_680)? (10.md)

'Everybody, fool or sage, has an individual soul. These souls exist (as
long as the body), but after death they are no more; there are no souls
which are born again. (11)

'There is neither virtue nor vice, there is no world beyond; on the
dissolution of the body the individual ceases to be.' (12)

'When a man acts or causes another to act, it is not his soul (âtman)
which acts or causes to act <span id="fr_685"></span>[3](#fn_681.md).' Thus
they (viz. the adherents of the Sâṅkhya philosophy) boldly proclaim.
(13)

How can those who hold such opinions explain (the variety of existence
in) the world? They go from darkness to utter darkness, being fools and
engaged in works. (14)

Some <span id="fr_686"></span>[4](#fn_682.md) say that there are five
elements and that

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

the soul is a sixth (substance), but they contend that the soul and the
world (i.e. the five elements) are eternal. (15)

'These (six substances) do not perish neither (without nor with a
cause); the non-existent does not come into existence, but all things
are eternal by their very nature <span id="fr_687"></span>[1](#fn_683.md).'
(16)

Some fools <span id="fr_688"></span>[2](#fn_684.md) say that there are five
skandhas of momentary existence. They do not admit that (the soul) is
different from, nor identical <span id="fr_689"></span>[3](#fn_685.md) with
(the elements), that it is produced from a cause (i.e. the elements),
nor that it is without a cause (i.e. that it is eternal). (17)

The *G*â*n*ayas <span id="fr_690"></span>[4](#fn_686.md) say that there are
four elements: earth, water, fire, and wind, which combined form the
body (or soul?). (18)

(All these heretics say): 'Those who dwell in houses, in woods, or on
hills, will be delivered from all misery if they adopt our creed.' (19)

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

But they do not cross the Flood of Life, who, ignoring the true relation
of things, and not versed in the true Law, hold the above heretical
opinions. (20)

They do not reach the end of the Sa*m*sâra, who, ignoring, &c. (21)

They do not reach the end of transmigration, who, &c. (22)

They do not put an end to birth, who, &c. (23)

They do not put an end to misery, who, &c. (24)

They do not put an end to death, who, &c. (25)

They will again and again experience manifold pains in this ring <span
id="fr_691"></span>[1](#fn_687.md) of the earth, which is full of death,
disease, and old age. (26)

The highest *G*ina, Mahâvîra the *Gñ*ât*ri*putra, has said that they
will undergo births without number, being placed in all sorts of
existences. (27)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_670"></span>[235:1](sbe4539.htm#fr_674.md) *S*rutaskandha. Its
Sanskrit title mentioned by *S*îlâṅka is Gâthâshô*d*a*s*aka, i.e. the
book whose Sixteenth Lecture is called Gâthâ. It is mentioned in the
Uttarâdhyayana XXXI, 13 by the name of the sixteen Gâthas; see above, p,
182.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[235:2](sbe4539.htm#fr_675.md) Samaya. This title
is not found in MSS. at the end of the lecture, but it is given by the
author of the Niryukti (verse 29). The subject of this lecture is more
fully treated in §§ 15-33 of the First Lecture of the Second Book.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[235:3](sbe4539.htm#fr_676.md) Tiu*tt*i*gg*â. The
commentators translate this word trô*t*ayêt, but the true Sanskrit
original is ativartêta, as is evident from the form atiu*tt*anti in I,
2, 22.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[235:4](sbe4539.htm#fr_677.md) Living and lifeless
things as we understand these words, not <span id="page_236">p.
236</span> as the *G*ainas do. The original has: *k*ittamanta*m*
a*k*itta*m* vâ, beings possessed of intellect, and things without
intellect. The latter are, according to *G*aina notions, living beings
*g*îva as well as inanimate matter.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[236:1](sbe4539.htm#fr_678.md) Literally, those in
whose family he is born. *S*îlâṅka, the author of the oldest *T*îkâ on
the Sûtrak*ri*tâṅga, names the Râsh*t*rakû*t*as or Râ*th*ors in order to
illustrate what is meant by family.'

<span id="fn_675"></span>[236:2](sbe4539.htm#fr_679.md) According to
*S*îlâṅka the Bauddhas, Bârhaspatyas, and others are intended.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[236:3](sbe4539.htm#fr_680.md) Grantha, passage in
a book. The verses 2-5 are intended.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[236:4](sbe4539.htm#fr_681.md) They are the
Nâstikas or *K*ârvâkas.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[236:5](sbe4539.htm#fr_682.md) In other words: the
Atman is produced by the elements. But there is, it would seem, but one
Atman, for in verses 11, 12, we have another heretical philosophy which
acknowledged a plurality of transient âtmans.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[237:1](sbe4539.htm#fr_683.md) This is the
doctrine of the Vêdântins.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[237:2](sbe4539.htm#fr_684.md) If there were but
one âtman common to all men, the fruit of works done by one man might
accrue to another. For the âtman is the substratum of merit and demerit.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[237:3](sbe4539.htm#fr_685.md) Though there is no
doubt about the meaning of this passage, still the construction is so
elliptic that I may have failed to understand the connection of the
parts of the sentence.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[237:4](sbe4539.htm#fr_686.md) This is the opinion
expressed by *K*araka and in the early law-books, see Professor Jolly's
paper in the Transactions of the Ninth International Congress of
Orientalists, vol. i, p. 456. *S*îlâṅka ascribes it to the Sâṅkhyas and
*S*aivâdhikârins.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[238:1](sbe4539.htm#fr_687.md) Niyatîbhâvam âgayâ.
Niyatî is explained by nityabhâva.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[238:2](sbe4539.htm#fr_688.md) Viz. the Bauddhas.
The five skandhas are explained in the commentary as follows: 1.
rûpaskandha, or substances and their qualities; 2. vêdanâskandha,
feelings, as pleasure and pain; 3. vi*gñ*ânaskandha, perceptions of the
qualities of things; 4. sa*mgñ*âskandha, perception and knowledge of
things; 5. sa*m*skâraskandha, merit and demerit.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[238:3](sbe4539.htm#fr_689.md) Identical, i.e. a
product of the elements as the *K*ârvâkas maintain.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[238:4](sbe4539.htm#fr_690.md) *G*â*n*aya, which
is explained in the Dîpikâ by *gñ*ânaka = pa*nd*ita*m*manya, denotes the
Bauddhas. I think that the word may be derived from yâna 'vehicle,'
which the Buddhist used to designate the two sections of the church,
viz. the Hînayâna and Mahâyâna schools. The commentator quotes a various
reading: âvarê for *g*â*n*ayâ, and explains it as referring to another
sect of Bauddhas than those spoken of in the preceding verse. *S*îlâṅka
comments on the reading avvarê first, and then on *g*â*n*aya.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[239:1](sbe4539.htm#fr_691.md) *K*akravâla.
