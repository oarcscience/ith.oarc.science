### THIRTIETH LECTURE.

###### THE ROAD OF PENANCE.

Now hear with concentrated mind, how a monk destroys by austerities the
bad Karman which he had acquired by love and hatred. (1)

By abstaining 1. from destroying life; 2. from lying; 3. from taking
anything which is not given; 4. from all sexual indulgence; 5. from
having any property; and 6. from eating at night, the soul becomes free
from Âsravas <span id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_464). (2.md)

By possessing the five Samitis and the three Guptis, by freedom from
passions, by subduing the senses, by vanquishing conceit <span
id="fr_467"></span>[2](#fn_465.md), and by avoiding delusions, the soul
becomes free from Âsravas. (3)

Hear attentively how a monk destroys (the Karman) acquired by love and
hatred in the absence of the above-mentioned (virtues). (4)

As a large tank, when its supply of water has been stopped, gradually
dries up by the consumption of the water and by evaporation, so the
Karman of a monk, which he acquired in millions <span
id="fr_468"></span>[3](#fn_466.md) of births, is annihilated by
austerities, if there is no influx of bad Karman. (5, 6)

Austerities are of two kinds: external and internal;

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

external austerities are of six kinds, and internal are of six
kinds <span id="fr_469"></span>[1](#fn_467). (7.md)

External austerities are:

1\. ana*s*ana, fasting; 2. avamôdarikâ, abstinence <span
id="fr_470"></span>[2](#fn_468.md); 3. bhikshâ*k*aryâ, collecting alms; 4.
rasaparityâga, abstention from dainty food; 5. kâyaklê*s*a,
mortification of the flesh; 6. sa*m*lînatâ, taking care of one's
limbs <span id="fr_471"></span>[3](#fn_469). (8.md)

1\. Fasting is of two kinds: *a*. itvara, temporary, and *b*.
mara*n*akâla, fasting which precedes, and ends with death. Temporary
fasting is either such in which a desire (for food) is present, or such
in which no such desire exists. (9)

*a*. The temporary fasting is briefly of six kinds: 1. in the form of a
line <span id="fr_472"></span>[4](#fn_470.md); 2. in the form of a square;
3. in the form of a cube; 4. of a sixth power; 5. of a twelfth power; 6.
of any arrangement. Temporary fasting (can be practised) for different
objects which one has in mind. (10, 11)

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

*b*. Fasting which is to precede death, is of two kinds with regard to
the motions of the body: with change (of position) and without change.
(12)

And again it is twofold: admitting of relief <span
id="fr_473"></span>[1](#fn_471.md), or not; one may either leave the place
(which one has chosen to die in), or not leave it; in both cases one may
not take any food. (13)

2\. Abstinence is briefly of five kinds: with regard to *a*. substance;
*b*. place; *c*. time; *d*. state of mind; *e*. development. (14)

*a*. He who takes less food than he usually does <span
id="fr_474"></span>[2](#fn_472.md), in the extreme case but one mouthful,
performs abstinence with regard to substance. (15)

*b*. (Place means) a village, a scotfree town <span
id="fr_475"></span>[3](#fn_473.md), a capital, a camp of merchants <span
id="fr_476"></span>[4](#fn_474.md), a mine, a settlement of a wild
tribe <span id="fr_477"></span>[5](#fn_475.md), a place with an earth
wall <span id="fr_478"></span>[6](#fn_476.md), a poor town <span
id="fr_479"></span>[7](#fn_477.md), a town with a harbour <span
id="fr_480"></span>[8](#fn_478.md), a large town <span
id="fr_481"></span>[9](#fn_479.md), an isolated town <span
id="fr_482"></span>[10](#fn_480.md), and an open town <span
id="fr_483"></span>[11](#fn_481). (16.md)

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

In a hermitage, a vihâra <span id="fr_484"></span>[1](#fn_482.md), a
halting-place for procession <span id="fr_485"></span>[2](#fn_483.md), a
resting-place for travellers <span id="fr_486"></span>[3](#fn_484.md), a
station of herdsmen, a camp on high ground, a caravan's camp, a
fortified place of refuge. (17)

In gardens, on roads, in houses--all this is meant by place. In these
and similar places he may (wander about). In this way he performs
abstinence with regard to place. (18)

1\. pê*t*â, 2. ardhapê*t*â, 3. gômûtrikâ, 4. pataṅgavîthikâ, 5.
*s*ambûkâvartta, 6. âyata*m*-gatvâ-pratyâgata <span
id="fr_487"></span>[4](#fn_485). (19.md)

*c*. Abstinence with reference to time (is observed by him) who goes
about in that time of the four Paurushîs of the day (which he selects
for that purpose). (20)

Or if he collects alms in a part of the third Paurushî, or in its last
quarter, then he observes abstinence with reference to time. (21)

*d*. Abstinence with reference to state of mind (is observed by him) who
accepts alms from a woman or man, from an adorned or unadorned person,
from one of any age or dress, of any temper or colour: if that person
does not change his disposition or condition <span
id="fr_488"></span>[5](#fn_486). (22, 23.md)

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

*e*. A monk who observes abstinence according to the particulars which
have been enumerated with regard to substance, place, time, and state of
mind, observes abstinence with regard to development <span
id="fr_489"></span>[1](#fn_487) too. (24.md)

3\. With regard to collecting alms there are the eight principal
ways <span id="fr_490"></span>[2](#fn_488.md) how to collect them; the
seven êsha*n*âs (or modes of begging) and other self-imposed
restrictions. (25)

4\. Abstention from dainty food means abstention from such highly
nourishing <span id="fr_491"></span>[3](#fn_489.md) food and drink as milk,
curds, ghee, &c. (26)

5\. Mortification of the flesh consists in the different postures as
Virâsana, &c., which benefit the soul, and which are difficult to
perform. (27)

6\. Using unfrequented lodgings and beds consists in living and sleeping
in separate and

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

unfrequented places where there are neither women nor cattle. (28)

Thus external austerities have been briefly explained; I shall now
explain internal austerities in due order. (29)

Internal austerities are:

1\. prâya*sk*itta, expiation of sins;

2\. vi*n*aya, politeness;

3\. vaiyâv*ri*tya, serving the Guru;

4\. svâdhyâya, study;

5\. dhyâna, meditation;

6\. vyutsarga <span id="fr_492"></span>[1](#fn_490.md), abandoning of the
body. (30)

1\. Expiation of sins is tenfold, what must be confessed <span
id="fr_493"></span>[2](#fn_491.md), &c.; this is to be strictly observed by
a monk; this is called expiation of sins. (31)

2\. Politeness consists in rising (from one's seat), folding of the
hands, offering of a seat, loving the Guru, and cordial obedience. (32)

3\. There are ten <span id="fr_494"></span>[3](#fn_492.md) kinds of
service, as serving the Â*k*ârya, &c. <span
id="fr_495"></span>[4](#fn_493.md); doing service consists in giving one's
assistance as well as one is able. (33)

4\. Study is fivefold: 1. saying or learning one's lesson; 2.
(questioning the teacher about it); 3. repetition; 4. pondering; 5.
religious discourse. (34)

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

5\. Abstaining to meditate on painful and sinful things <span
id="fr_496"></span>[1](#fn_494.md), one should, with a collected mind,
engage in pure meditations on the Law; this the wise call meditation.
(35)

6\. If a monk remains motionless when lying down, sitting, or standing
upright, this is called abandoning of the body, which is the sixth kind
(of internal austerities). (36)

If a sage truly performs these two kinds of austerities, he will soon be
thoroughly released from the Circle of Births. (37)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_464"></span>[174:1](sbe4532.htm#fr_466.md) Karmôpâdânahêtavas,
that through which the soul becomes affected by Karman.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[174:2](sbe4532.htm#fr_467.md) Agârava = agaurava;

sa*m*v*ri*tya pravartanam, *T*îkâ.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[175:4](sbe4532.htm#fr_472.md) The meaning of this
singular statement is as follows. If four fasts of two, three, four, and
five days are performed in this order, they form a line. If this set of
fasts is four times repeated, each time beginning with a different
number, we get sixteen fasts; they form a square, viz.:

<div align="center">

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 1   | .   | 2   | .   | 3   | .   | 4   |

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The next class
contains 64 fasts, the fourth 4,096, the fifth 16,777,216 fasts. Fasts
of the last class require 700,000 years at least, and must be assumed to
be restricted to former Tîrthakaras, whose lives lasted enormous periods
of time.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[176:1](sbe4532.htm#fr_473.md) Saparikarma =
vaiyâv*ri*tyasahita. This leads to iṅginîmara*n*a and

<span id="fn_472"></span>[176:2](sbe4532.htm#fr_474.md) Thirty-two
mouthfuls is the usual quantity of food of men, twenty-eight that of

<span id="fn_477"></span>[176:7](sbe4532.htm#fr_479.md) Karva*t*a.
According to the dictionary, it means 'market-town;' but the
commentators render it by kunagara, or say that it is
karva*t*a*g*anâvâsa, the dwelling-place of the Karva*t*a people.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[176:8](sbe4532.htm#fr_480.md) Drô*n*amukha, a
town to which there is access by water and land, like Bh*ri*guka*kkh*a
or Tâmralipti.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[176:9](sbe4532.htm#fr_481.md) Pa*tt*ana.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[177:3](sbe4532.htm#fr_486.md) Samâ*g*a.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[177:4](sbe4532.htm#fr_487.md) These are terms for
different kinds of collecting alms; it is called pê*t*â (box), when one
begs successively at four houses forming the corners of an imaginary
square; gômûtrikâ, when he takes the houses in a zigzag line;
pataṅgavîthikâ (cricket's walk), when he goes to houses at a great
distance from one another; *s*ambûkâvartta (the windings of a conch),
when he goes in a spiral line, either toward the centre (abhyantara) or
from the centre outward (bahis); âyata*m*-gatvâ-pratyâgata, when he
first goes straight on and then returns.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[177:5](sbe4532.htm#fr_488.md) I give the
traditional explanation of the verses, as handed <span id="page_178">p.
178</span> down in the commentaries. If we might set it aside, I should
translate: abstinence with reference to disposition is observed by him
who in collecting alms preserves the same disposition, whether he has to
do with a woman or man, &c.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[178:1](sbe4532.htm#fr_489.md) For development
(pa*gg*ava = paryâya) denotes any form or phase of existence which
anything can assume. Therefore all particulars of place, e.g. are
developments of Place. As all restrictions of place, &c., indirectly
diminish the food obtainable by a monk, they also come under the head
Abstinence.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[178:2](sbe4532.htm#fr_490.md) According to the
commentator, these are the six kinds enumerated in verse 29.
Sambûkâvartta is of two kinds, as explained in the note; the eighth kind
is *rig*vî, or the common way of begging. These eight ways have
reference to the houses in which they collect alms. The seven êsha*n*âs
refer to the quality or quantity of the food; their names are given in
the *T*îkâ, partly in Prâk*ri*t, partly in Sanskrit: 1. sa*m*sa*tth*â;
2. asa*m*sa*tth*â; 3. uddha*d*â; 4. alpalêpikâ; 5. udg*ri*hîtâ; 6.
prag*ri*hîtâ; 7. u*ggh*itadharmâ. According to another passage: 1. is
sa*m*sp*ri*sh*t*a, 3. uddhrita, 5. avag*ri*hîta.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[178:3](sbe4532.htm#fr_491.md) Pra*n*îta,
explained push*t*ikara.

<span id="fn_490"></span>[179:1](sbe4532.htm#fr_492.md) Viôsagga, viussaga,
viusagga. It is usually rendered vyutsarga, but the Sanskrit prototype
is vyavasarga, as Leumann has pointed out, l.c., p. 152.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[179:2](sbe4532.htm#fr_493.md) Compare Aupapâtika
Sûtra, ed. Leumann, p. 40.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[179:3](sbe4532.htm#fr_494.md) Ibidem, p. 42.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[179:4](sbe4532.htm#fr_495.md) They are enumerated
in the following Gâthâ: âyariya-uva*ggh*âê
thêra-tavassî-gilâ*n*a-sêhâ*n*a \|
sâhhmmiya-kula-ga*n*a-saṅgha-sa*m*gaya*m* tam iha kâyavva*m*. The ten
persons or body of persons entitled to 'service' are: 1. â*k*ârya; 2.
upâdhyâya; 3. sthavira; 4. tapasvin; 5. glâna; 6. *s*aiksha; 7.
sâdharmika; 8. kula; 9. ga*n*a; 10. saṅgha.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[180:1](sbe4532.htm#fr_496.md) This is the
ârtaraudradhyâna.
