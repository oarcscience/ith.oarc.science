## NINTH LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### THE LAW.

What is the Law that has been preached by the wise Brâhma*n*a <span
id="fr_892"></span>[1](#fn_885) (i.e. Mahâvîra.md)? Learn from me the noble
Law of the *G*inas as it is. (1)

Brâhma*n*as, Kshattriyas, Vai*s*yas, *K*â*nd*âlas, Vukkasas,
hunters <span id="fr_893"></span>[2](#fn_886.md), merchants <span
id="fr_894"></span>[3](#fn_887.md), *S*ûdras, and others who are accustomed
to do acts; (2)

The iniquity <span id="fr_895"></span>[4](#fn_888.md) of all these men who
cling to property goes on increasing; for those who procure themselves
pleasures by sinful acts will not get rid of misery. (3)

After a man has done acts which cause the death of living beings, his
pleasure-seeking relations take possession of his wealth, whilst the
doer of the acts must suffer for them. (4)

'Mother, father, daughter-in-law, brother, wife, and sons will not be
able to help me, when I suffer for my own deeds <span
id="fr_896"></span>[5](#fn_889).' (5.md)

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

Taking to heart this truth from which flow the most important truths, a
monk, without property and without egoism, should follow the teaching of
the *G*inas. (6)

Leaving his wealth, sons, relations, and property, leaving sorrow that
never ceases, (a monk) should wander about without any worldly
interests. (7)

Earth, water, fire, and wind; grass, trees, and corn; oviparous animals,
the two kinds of viviparous <span id="fr_897"></span>[1](#fn_890.md)
animals; beings engendered in fluids and in dirt, and plants; (8)

These six classes of living beings a wise man should know and treat
tenderly, in thoughts, words, and acts; he should neither do actions nor
desire property whereby he might do them any harm. (9)

Untrue speech, sexual intercourse, personal property, taking things that
are not freely given: all these causes of injury to living beings a wise
man should abstain from. (10)

Deceit <span id="fr_898"></span>[2](#fn_891.md), greed <span
id="fr_899"></span>[3](#fn_892.md), anger <span
id="fr_900"></span>[4](#fn_893.md), and pride <span
id="fr_901"></span>[5](#fn_894.md): combat these causes of sin; a wise man
should abstain from them. (11)

Washing, dyeing, making urine, evacuation of the bowels, vomiting,
anointing of the eyes, and whatever is contrary to the rules of
conduct <span id="fr_902"></span>[6](#fn_895.md): from all this a wise man
should abstain. (12)

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

Perfumes, wreaths, bathing, cleansing of the teeth, property, actions
referring to women: from all this a wise man should abstain. (13)

Alms that have been prepared, or bought, or stolen, or brought for the
sake of a monk, or alms that contain particles of the above mentioned,
or such alms as are unacceptable (for one cause or other), from all
these a wise man should abstain. (14)

Invigorating food, anointing of the eyes, greed, damaging others,
washing (one's limbs), (rubbing them with) Lôdhra-powder, &c.: from all
this a wise man should abstain. (15)

Deliberating with laymen, praising their work, answering their
questions, eating the householder's meals: from all this a wise man
should abstain. (16)

He should not learn to play chess <span id="fr_903"></span>[1](#fn_896.md),
he should not speak anything forbidden by the Law; a wise man should
abstain from fights and quarrels. (17)

Shoes, an umbrella, dice, chowries, working for another, helping each
other: from all this a wise man should abstain. (18)

A monk should not void his excrements or urine among plants; he should
never rinse his mouth (even) with distilled water after having removed
(everything endowed with life). (19)

He should never eat or drink out of a householder's vessel; nor wear his
clothes, especially if he

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

is a naked monk: from all this a wise man should abstain. (20)

A stool or bed or a seat in a house, asking of news and recollection (of
past sports): from all this a wise man should abstain. (21)

Fame, glory, and renown; honours and respectful treatment; all pleasures
in the whole world: from all this a wise man should abstain. (22)

A monk (should be content) with such food and drink as will sustain his
life; he should give a portion of it to others: \[from all this a wise
man should abstain <span id="fr_904"></span>[1](#fn_897).\] (23.md)

Thus spoke the Nirgrantha, the great sage Mahâvîra; he who possesses
infinite knowledge and faith has taught the Law and the sacred
texts <span id="fr_905"></span>[2](#fn_898). (24.md)

In speaking (a monk) should use as few words as possible; he should not
delight in another's foibles; he should avoid deceiving speech <span
id="fr_906"></span>[3](#fn_899.md), and should answer after ripe
reflection. (25)

One will repent of having used the third kind of speech <span
id="fr_907"></span>[4](#fn_900.md); a secret should not be made known. This
is the Nirgrantha's commandment. (26)

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

(A monk) should not call one names <span
id="fr_908"></span>[1](#fn_901.md), nor 'friend,' nor by his Gôtra; 'thou,
thou' is vulgar; never address one by 'thou!' (27)

A virtuous monk should never keep company (with the wicked); for thereby
he incurs dangers (for his conduct) disguised as pleasures. A wise man
should be aware of them. (28)

(A monk) should not stay in the house of a householder except by
constraint; nor should he amuse himself too long (by looking) at the
sports of the children of the village <span
id="fr_909"></span>[2](#fn_902). (29.md)

Not desirous of fine things, he should wander about, exerting himself;
not careless in his conduct, he should bear whatever pains he has to
suffer. (30)

If beaten, he should not be angry; if abused, he should not fly into a
passion; with a placid mind he should bear everything and not make a
great noise. (31)

He should not enjoy pleasures though they offer themselves; for thus he
is said (to reach) discernment. He should always practise what is right
to do in the presence of the enlightened ones. (32)

He should obey and serve a wise and pious teacher, (such teachers) as
are heroes (of faith), who search for the benefit of their souls, are
firm in control, and subdue their senses. (33)

These men, who do not see the light (as it were) in domestic life, are
the beloved of the people; these heroes, free from bondage, do not
desire life. (34)

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

They do not long for sensual pleasures, they do not engage in works. All
that (the heretics) always talk about, is opposed to the right faith.
(35)

Excessive pride and deceit, all worldly vanities: all this a wise man
knows and renounces, and thus brings about his final Liberation. (36)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_885"></span>[301:1](sbe4557.htm#fr_892.md) The word brâhma*n*a
(mâha*n*a) is here, as in many other passages, a mere honorific title
which could be rendered by 'ascetic.'

<span id="fn_886"></span>[301:2](sbe4557.htm#fr_893.md) Êsiya.

<span id="fn_887"></span>[301:3](sbe4557.htm#fr_894.md) Vêsiya.

<span id="fn_888"></span>[301:4](sbe4557.htm#fr_895.md) Vêra = vaira.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[301:5](sbe4557.htm#fr_896.md) This verse recurs
in Uttarâdhyayana VI, 3; above, [p. 25](sbe4508.htm#page_25.md).

<span id="fn_890"></span>[302:1](sbe4557.htm#fr_897.md) Pôya*g*arâû =
pôta*g*arâyu, i.e. born alive (as elephants, &c.) and born together with
the chorion (as cows, &c.)

<span id="fn_891"></span>[302:2](sbe4557.htm#fr_898.md) Paliu*ñk*a*n*a =
pariku*ñk*ana, i.e. mâyâ.

<span id="fn_892"></span>[302:3](sbe4557.htm#fr_899.md) Bhaya*n*a =
bha*g*ana, i.e. lôbha.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[302:4](sbe4557.htm#fr_900.md) Tha*nd*illa, i.e.
krôdha.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[302:5](sbe4557.htm#fr_901.md) Ussaya*n*a =
u*kkh*raya, i.e. mâna. These four passions are named here from the way
in which they are supposed to act upon the soul. Similar names occurred
above, [p. 248](sbe4542.htm#page_248.md), notes
[3](sbe4542.htm#fn_723)-[6](sbe4542.htm#fn_726.md).

<span id="fn_895"></span>[302:6](sbe4557.htm#fr_902.md) Palimantha.

<span id="fn_896"></span>[303:1](sbe4557.htm#fr_903.md) Ash*t*âpada. This
does not necessarily, in this place, mean chess-board, but any game
played on a similar chequered board may be intended. The earliest
unmistakable mention of chess, that I have met with, occurs in
Ratnâkara's Haravi*g*aya XII, 9, a mahâkâvya written in the first half
of the ninth century A. D. in Kashmir.--Another explanation of
a*tth*âvaya*m* is arthapadam = artha*s*âstram 'means of acquiring
property.'

<span id="fn_897"></span>[304:1](sbe4557.htm#fr_904.md) The last part of
this verse is here repeated from the preceding ones; but it is quite out
of place here.

<span id="fn_898"></span>[304:2](sbe4557.htm#fr_905.md) Here apparently
ended the original treatise; the following verses are not directly
connected with it.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[304:3](sbe4557.htm#fr_906.md) Mâi*tth*â*n*a*m*,
always rendered mât*ri*sthânam. I think it is a regular corruption for
mâyâsthânam. The second syllable of the word becomes short before two
consonants, and then the ya was changed into i with which it is almost
interchangeable.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[304:4](sbe4557.htm#fr_907.md) The four kinds of
speech are (1) true speech, (2) untrue speech, (3) speech partly true
and partly untrue, (4) speech which is neither true nor untrue, see part
i, p. 150.--Inaccurate statements are intended here.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[305:1](sbe4557.htm#fr_908.md) Hôlâ, which is said
to be a Dê*s*î word of abuse. The same word occurs also in the
Â*k*ârâṅga Sûtra, see part i, p. 151, where I translated it by 'loon.'

<span id="fn_902"></span>[305:2](sbe4557.htm#fr_909.md) According to
*S*îlâṅka: (he should not join) the sports of the children of a village,
nor amuse himself too long.
