## FIFTEENTH LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### THE YAMAKAS <span id="fr_968"></span>[1](#fn_961.md).

What is past, present, and to come, all this is known to the Leader, the
Saviour, who annihilates the hindrances to right faith. (1)

The annihilator of doubt knows the incomparable (Law); he, the expounder
of the incomparable (Law), is not inclined towards this or that
(heretical doctrine). (2).

On this or that (article of the creed he has) the correct opinion; hence
he is rightly called a true (man); he who always possesses the truth, is
kind towards his fellow-creatures. (3)

Towards your fellow-creatures be not hostile: that is the Law of him who
is rich in control; he who is rich in control renounces everything, and
in this (world meditates on the) reflections on life <span
id="fr_969"></span>[2](#fn_962). (4.md)

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

He whose soul is purified by meditating on those reflections is compared
to a ship in water; like a ship reaching the shore he gets beyond
misery. (5)

A wise man gets beyond it who knows the sins of this world; sinful acts
are got rid of by him who does not undertake any new acts. (6)

He who does not undertake new acts does not acquire Karman, and he
verily understands (Karman); understanding it he becomes a Great
Hero <span id="fr_970"></span>[1](#fn_963), who is not born (again.md) and
does not die. (7)

A Great Hero, who has no Karman, does not die.--As the wind extinguishes
a light, (so he puts down) the lovely women in this world. (8)

Those men whom women do not seduce, value Môksha most; those men are
free from bondage and do not desire life. (9)

Turning from worldly life, they reach the goal by pious acts; by their
pious acts they are directed (towards Liberation), and they show the way
to others. (10)

The preaching of the Law (has different effect) on different creatures;
he who is rich in control, is. treated with honour <span
id="fr_971"></span>[2](#fn_964.md), but does not care for it; he exerts
himself, subdues his senses, is firm, and abstains from sexual
intercourse. (i1)

(He should not yield to temptations as a pig which) is decoyed by wild
rice, being proof against sins, and free from faults. Being free from
faults he always

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

subdues his senses, and has reached the incomparable cession of
Karman <span id="fr_972"></span>[1](#fn_965). (12.md)

Knowing the incomparable (control), he should not be hostile towards
anybody, in thoughts, words, or deeds, having eyes (to see everything).
(13)

He truly is the eye of men who (dwells so to speak) on the end <span
id="fr_973"></span>[2](#fn_966) of desire; on its end (i.e. edge.md) glides
the razor, on its end (i.e. rim) rolls the wheel. (14)

Because the wise use the ends (of things, i.e. bad food, &c.), they are
called 'makers of an end' here. Here in the world of men we are men to
fulfil the Law. (15)

In this creed which surpasses the world, (men) become perfected saints
or gods, as I have heard; and I have heard that outside the rank of men
this is not so <span id="fr_974"></span>[3](#fn_967). (16.md)

Some (heretics) have said that they (viz. the gods) put an end to
misery <span id="fr_975"></span>[4](#fn_968); but others (*G*ainas.md) have
repeatedly said that this (human) body is not easily obtained. (17)

To one whose soul has left (human life), it is not easy again to obtain
instruction (in the Law), nor is such a mental disposition which they
declare appropriate for adopting the Law <span
id="fr_976"></span>[5](#fn_969). (18.md)

How can it even be imagined that he should

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

be born again, who professes the pure, complete, unparalleled Law, and
is a receptacle of the unparalleled Law? (19)

How could the wise Tathâgatas be born again, the Tathâgatas who engage
in no undertakings, the supreme, the eyes of the world? (20)

And there has been declared by the Kâ*s*yapa the supreme condition <span
id="fr_977"></span>[1](#fn_970.md), by realising which some happy and wise
men reach excellence. (21)

A wise man who has gained strength (in control) which leads to the
expiation of sins, annihilates his former works, and does not do new
ones. (22)

The Great Hero does no actions which are the effects of former sins. By
his actions he is directed (towards Môksha), abstaining from works which
are entailed by birth <span id="fr_978"></span>[2](#fn_971). (23.md)

That which all saints value highly (viz. control), destroys the thorn
(viz. Karman); practising it some have been liberated, and others have
become gods. (24)

There have been wise men, and there will be pious men, who having come
to the end and made manifest the end of the incomprehensible path, have
been liberated. (25)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_961"></span>[329:1](sbe4563.htm#fr_968.md) This lecture has
been named from its opening words *g*amaîyam, which also means,
consisting of yamakas (compare Journal of the German Oriental Society,
vol. xl, p. 101). For in this lecture each verse or line opens with a
word repeated from the end of the preceding one. This artifice is
technically called *sri*ṅkhala-yamaka, or chain-yam aka, a term which
seems to be contained in another name of our lecture, mentioned by the
author of the Niryukti (verse 28), viz. âdâniya-saṅkaliyâ. For saṅkaliyâ
is the Prâk*ri*t for *sri*ṅkhala (e.g. in our text I, 5, 2, 20), though
*S*îlâṅka here renders it wrongly saṅkalita; and âdâniya by itself is
used as a name of our lecture.

<span id="fn_962"></span>[329:2](sbe4563.htm#fr_969.md) These are the
twelve bhâvanâs or meditations on the vanity of life and the world in
general, and on the excellence of the Law, &c.

<span id="fn_963"></span>[330:1](sbe4563.htm#fr_970.md) Mahâvîra.

<span id="fn_964"></span>[330:2](sbe4563.htm#fr_971.md) Pûya*n*âsaê,
explained by pû*g*anâ-âsvâdaka. I should prefer pû*g*â-nâ*s*aka, who
abolished the worship of gods, in which case the following word a*n*âsaê
= an-â*s*aya might be rendered: he makes no plans.

<span id="fn_965"></span>[331:1](sbe4563.htm#fr_972.md) Sandhipattê. Sandhi
is explained Karmavivaralaksha*n*am bhâvasandhim.

<span id="fn_966"></span>[331:2](sbe4563.htm#fr_973.md) There is a play on
the word 'end' in this and the next verse which to a modern mind savours
more of the absurd than the profound.

<span id="fn_967"></span>[331:3](sbe4563.htm#fr_974.md) Perfection cannot
be obtained by other creatures than men.

<span id="fn_968"></span>[331:4](sbe4563.htm#fr_975.md) I.e. reach final
beatitude.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[331:5](sbe4563.htm#fr_976.md) The words as they
are preserved do not construe; the meaning, however, must have been
about what I have given in the translation.

<span id="fn_970"></span>[332:1](sbe4563.htm#fr_977.md) Viz. control.

<span id="fn_971"></span>[332:2](sbe4563.htm#fr_978.md) *G*a*m*maya*m*. The
commentators explain it yan matam; but I think it is = *g*anma*g*am.
