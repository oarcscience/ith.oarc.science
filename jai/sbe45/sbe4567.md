## THIRD LECTURE,

###### CALLED

###### KNOWLEDGE OF FOOD.

O long-lived (*G*ambûsvâmin)! I (Sudharman) have heard the following
discourse from the Venerable (Mahâvîra). We now come to the Lecture
called 'Knowledge of Food.' The contents of it are as follows:

Here in the East, West, North, and South there are, all in all, in the
world four kinds of seed: seeds generated at the top (of the plant), at
its root, at its knots, at its stem <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[1](#fn_1131.md). According to the seed and place

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (of growth) of
these plants some beings--born in earth, originated in earth, and grown
in earth, having in it their birth, origin, and growth, being impelled
by their Karman, and coming forth in it on account of their Karman,
growing there in particles of earth, the origin of various things--come
forth as trees <span id="fr_1140"></span>[1](#fn_1132). (1.md)

These living beings feed on the liquid substance <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[2](#fn_1133.md) of these particles of earth, the
origin of various things; these beings consume earth-bodies,
water-bodies, fire-bodies, wind-bodies, bodies of plants; they deprive
of life the bodies of manifold movable and immovable beings; the
destroyed bodies which have been consumed before, or absorbed by the
rind, (are) digested and assimilated (by them). And the bodies of these
(trees) which bring forth their different parts, are of manifold
colours, smells, tastes, touches, forms, and arrangement of corporeal
particles <span id="fr_1142"></span>[3](#fn_1134.md).

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

These beings (animating trees) come into existence because of their
Karman; so we are taught (by the Tîrthakaras, &c.) (2)

And again it has been said of old: some beings born in trees, originated
by trees, sprung from trees, (&c., as in § 1, down to) springing from
trees that originated in earth, come forth as trees originated by
trees <span id="fr_1143"></span>[1](#fn_1135.md). These beings feed on the
sap of the trees originated in earth, (&c., all as in § 2, down to the
end). (3)

(In the same way, and in nearly the same words, the offshoots of the
trees mentioned in the preceding paragraph are treated of.) (4)

And again it has been said of old: some beings born in trees, (&c., all
as above, down to) growing in trees, that are originated by trees, come
forth as their roots, bulb, stem, branches, twigs, leaves, flowers,
fruits, and seeds <span id="fr_1144"></span>[2](#fn_1136.md). These beings
feed on the sap of those trees originated by trees, (&c., all as in § 2,
down to) and the bodies of the roots, bulb, stem, &c. are of manifold
colours, (&c., all as in § 2, down to the end). (5)

(The four paragraphs that come next, 6-9, are identical with the
preceding ones, except that 'creeper <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[3](#fn_1137)' is substituted for 'tree.') (6-9.md)

(In the same way 'grass <span id="fr_1146"></span>[4](#fn_1138.md)' is
treated in four paragraphs, but the whole is much abridged; then

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

it is said that 'herbs <span id="fr_1147"></span>[1](#fn_1139.md)' and
'plants <span id="fr_1148"></span>[2](#fn_1140.md)' are to be treated in
four paragraphs each.) (10-15)

And again it has been said of old: some beings born in earth, (&c., all
as in § 1, down to) growing there in particles of earth that are the
origin of various things, come forth as Aya, Kâya, Kuha*n*a, Kandu,
Uvvêhaliya, Nivvêhaliya, Êsava, Sa*kkh*a, *Kh*attaga, Vâsâ*n*iya <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[3](#fn_1141.md). (The rest as in § 2, but substitute
the words Âya, &c. for 'trees.') Here there is only one paragraph, the
remaining three do not apply here <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[4](#fn_1142). (16.md)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

And again it has been said of old: some beings born in water, (&c., all
as in §§ 1-11, substitute only 'water' for 'earth.' Thus we have four
paragraphs for trees, four for creepers, four for grass, four for herbs,
four for plants). (17)

Now it has been said of old: some beings born in water, (&c., all as
above, down to) growing in particles of water that are the origin of
various things, come forth as Udaga, Avaga <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[5](#fn_1143.md), Pa*n*aga, Sêvâla <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[6](#fn_1144.md), Kalambuya <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[7](#fn_1145.md), Kasêruya <span
id="fr_1154"></span>[8](#fn_1146.md), Ka*kkh*abhâ*n*iya, Uppala,

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pauma, Kumuya,
Nali*n*a <span id="fr_1155"></span>[1](#fn_1147.md), Subhagasô*n*iya,
Po*nd*ariya, Mahâpo*nd*ariya, Sayavatta, Sahassavatta, Kalhâra,
Kôka*n*ada, Tâmarasa <span id="fr_1156"></span>[2](#fn_1148.md), as stalks
and fibres of lotus, as Pukkhala <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[3](#fn_1149.md), and Pukkhalatthibhaga. (The rest
similar as in § 2.) (18)

And again it has been said of old: some beings come forth as movable
beings from trees born in earth, from trees originated by trees, from
the roots, (&c., down to) seeds produced by trees, originated by
creepers born on trees, from creepers born on creepers, from the roots,
&c. of creepers born on creepers, from grass <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[4](#fn_1150.md), from herbs <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[4](#fn_1150.md), from plants <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[4](#fn_1150), from Aya, (&c., all down to.md) Kûra
born in earth; from trees born in water (the rest similar as with trees
born in earth), from Udaga, (&c., all down to) Pukkhalatthibhaga born in
water. (19)

These creatures feed on the sap of the trees, creepers, grass, herbs,
plants, be they born in earth or water, on trees or creepers or grass or
herbs or plants; (the sap) of their roots, (&c., all down to) seeds, of
Âyas, &c., of Udakas, &c. And these creatures consume earth-bodies,
(&c., all as in § 2, down to) assimilated by them. And the bodies of
these beings born of trees, creepers, grass, herbs, plants, their roots,
&c., of Âyas, &c., of Udagas, &c., are of manifold colours, (&c., the
rest as in § 2, down to the end). (20)

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

And again it has been said of old: a man and a woman combine in
cohabitation in a cunnus, which was produced by their Karman, and there
they deposit their humours. Therein are born the souls of different men,
viz. of those born in Karmabhûmi <span
id="fr_1161"></span>[1](#fn_1151.md), or in Akarmabhûmi, or in the minor
continents, of Âryas and barbarians, as women or men or eunuchs,
according to the semen and blood of the mother <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[2](#fn_1152.md) and the other circumstances <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[3](#fn_1153.md) (contingent on their coming into
existence). These beings at first feed on the menses of the mother and
the semen of the father, or both combined into an unclean, foul
(substance). And afterwards they absorb with a part (of their bodies)
the essence <span id="fr_1164"></span>[4](#fn_1154.md) of whatever food the
mothers take. Gradually increasing and attaining to the proper
dimensions of a foetus <span id="fr_1165"></span>[5](#fn_1155.md) they come
forth from the womb, some as males, some as females, some as neuters. As
long as they are babies, they suck the mother's milk; but when they grow
older, they eat boiled rice, or gruel, or both movable and immovable
beings. These beings consume earth-bodies, (&c., all as before, down to)
assimilated by them. And the bodies of these men, viz. those born in
Karmabhûmi, or Akarmabhûmi, or in the minor continents, of Âryas and
barbarians, are of manifold

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

colours, (&c., all as in § 2, down to the end). (21)

(This paragraph is nearly identical with the preceding one, but
substitute 'aquatic animals of five organs of sense, viz. fishes, (all
down to) <span id="fr_1166"></span>[1](#fn_1156.md) porpoises,' for
'different men' in the beginning and the end. The following sentence in
the middle is slightly different; it runs thus: 'as long as they are
young, they feed on the mothers’ humours, but when they grow older they
eat plants, or both movable and immovable beings.') (22)

(This paragraph treats of) quadrupeds <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[2](#fn_1157.md), terrestrial animals with five organs
of sense, viz. solidungular animals, biungular animals, multiungular
animals, and animals having toes with nails. (All as in the last
paragraph, only 'as long as they are young, they feed on their mothers’
milk.') (23)

(This paragraph treats of) reptiles moving on the breast, (being)
terrestrial animals with five organs of sense, viz. snakes, huge
snakes <span id="fr_1168"></span>[3](#fn_1158.md), Â*s*âlika, and
dragons <span id="fr_1169"></span>[4](#fn_1159.md). (All as before, but the
following passage is different.) Some bring forth eggs, some bring forth
living young ones; some come out of the egg as males, some as females,
some as neuters. As long as they are young, they live on wind. (The rest
as above.) (24)

(This paragraph treats of) terrestrial animals with five organs of
sense, walking on their arms, viz. iguanas, ichneumons, porcupines,
frogs, chameleons,

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Khôras,
Gharakôillas <span id="fr_1170"></span>[1](#fn_1160.md),
Vissa*m*bharas <span id="fr_1171"></span>[2](#fn_1161.md), rats,
man-gooses, Païlâiyas, cats, *G*ôhas, *K*âuppâiyas <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[3](#fn_1162). (The rest as in the last paragraph..md)
(25)

(This paragraph treats of) aerial animals with five organs of sense:
birds with membranous wings, birds with feathered wings, birds with
wings in the shape of a box, and birds (which sit on) outspread
wings <span id="fr_1173"></span>[4](#fn_1163.md). (All as before; only the
following passage is different): 'As long as they are young, they are
hatched by their mothers’ warmth.' (The rest as above.) (26)

And again it has been said of old: there are beings of manifold birth
and origin, (&c., all as in § 1, down to) growing there on the animate
or inanimate bodies of manifold movable or immovable creatures, come
forth as parasites <span id="fr_1174"></span>[5](#fn_1164.md). These beings
feed on the humours of various movable and immovable creatures, &c. And
the bodies of these movable and immovable parasites are of manifold
colours, (&c., as above). (27)

In the same way vermin generated in filthy substances <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[6](#fn_1165.md) and in the skin of living
animals <span id="fr_1176"></span>[7](#fn_1166.md) are to be treated of.
(28, 29)

And again it has been said of old: there are some beings of manifold
birth and origin, (&c., all as in § 1,

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

down to) growing thereon (or in) the animate or inanimate bodies of
manifold movable or immovable creatures as that (water)-body <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[1](#fn_1167.md), which is produced by wind, condensed
by wind, and carried along by wind; it goes upwards, when there is an
upward wind; it goes downwards, when there is a downward wind; it goes
in a horizontal direction, when there is a horizontal wind; (its
varieties are) hoar-frost, snow, mist, hailstones, dew, and rain. These
beings feed on the humours of these manifold movable and immovable
creatures, &c. And the bodies of these (water-lives, viz.) hoar-frost,
&c., produced by manifold movable or immovable creatures, are of
manifold colours, (&c., as above) <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[2](#fn_1168). (30.md)

And again it has been said of old: some beings, born in water, (&c., all
similar as in § 1, down to) come forth in water(-bodies) in the water
produced by manifold movable or immovable beings. These beings feed on
the humours of the water(-bodies) produced by manifold movable and
immovable creatures. (The rest similar as above.) (31)

And again it has been said of old: some beings, born in water, (&c., all
similar as in § 1, down to) come forth in water-bodies produced by other
water-bodies. These beings feed on the humours of those other
water-bodies produced by water-bodies. (The rest similar as above.) (32)

And again it has been said of old: some beings, born in water, (&c., all
similar as in § 1, down to) come forth as movable creatures in the water

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

produced by water-bodies. These beings feed on the humours of the
water(-bodies) produced by water. (The rest similar as before.) (33)

And again it has been said of old: some beings, of various birth and
origin, (&c., all as in § 1, down to) come forth as fire-bodies in the
manifold animate or inanimate bodies of movable or immovable
creatures <span id="fr_1179"></span>[1](#fn_1169.md). These beings feed on
the manifold movable or immovable creatures. The rest similar as
before.)

The remaining three paragraphs are similar (to those treating of)
water-bodies. (34)

(This paragraph treats of wind-bodies in the same way as the preceding
ones treated of fire-bodies; like it, it consists of four paragraphs).
(35)

And again it has been said of old: some beings, of various birth and
origin, (&c., all as in § 1, down to) come forth, in the manifold
animate and inanimate bodies of movable and immovable creatures <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[2](#fn_1170.md), as earth, gravel, &c. Here the
following verses (from the Uttarâdhyayana XXXVI, 74-77) are to be made
use of:

1\. Earth, gravel, sand, stones, rocks, rock-salt, iron, copper, tin,
lead, silver, gold, and diamond;

2\. Orpiment, vermilion, realgar, Sâsaka, antimony, coral,
Abhrapa*t*ala, Abhravâluka; these are varieties of gross (earth-)bodies,
and precious stones.

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

3\. Hyacinth, natron, Aṅka, crystal, Lôhitâksha, emerald, Masâragalla,
Bhu*g*amô*k*aka, and sapphire;

4\. *K*andana, red chalk, Ha*m*sagarbha, Pulaka, and sulphur;
*K*andraprabha, lapis lazuli, *G*alakânta, and Sûryakânta.

These beings feed on the humours of these manifold movable and immovable
beings. (The rest as above.)

The remaining three paragraphs are similar (to those treating of)
water-bodies. (36)

And again it has been said of old: all sorts of living beings, of
manifold birth, origin, and growth, born in bodies, originated in
bodies, grown in bodies, feeding on bodies, experience their Karman, are
actuated by it, have their form and duration of life determined by
Karman, and undergo changes through the influence of Karman. This you
should know, and knowing it you will be careful and circumspect with
regard to your food, and always exert yourself. (37)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[388:1](sbe4567.htm#fr_1139.md) The commentators
here give the reading of the Nâgâr*g*unîyas: 'the growth of seeds of the
plants is fivefold, viz. they grow from the top (of the plant), its
root, its knots, its stem, and its beads; <span id="page_389">p.
389</span> and some are of a sixth kind called sammûr*kh*ima' (i.e.
those plants which are believed to be originated by the coalescing
particles of the substance in which they grow, e.g. grass springing up
on ground lately cleared by fire).--The various readings of the
Nâgâr*g*unîyas are occasionally quoted in commentaries (see e.g. part i,
p. 32, note 2). But I do not think that it has been satisfactorily made
out who these Nâgâr*g*unîyas were.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[389:1](sbe4567.htm#fr_1140.md) The meaning is,
that souls who on account of their Karman are to be born as trees,
previously are embodied in earth, and thence they are transferred by
their Karman to the seed which brings forth the tree.

<span id="fn_1133"></span>[389:2](sbe4567.htm#fr_1141.md) Si*n*êha,
explained: snigdhabhâva. In the sequel where plants are spoken of, I
shall render this word by 'sap' or 'humours,' as the context may
require.

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[389:3](sbe4567.htm#fr_1142.md) I.e. the food
assimilated by the tree is the material of which its different parts, as
root, stem, leaves, &c., are formed, and these parts are of manifold
form, colours, &c.

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[390:1](sbe4567.htm#fr_1143.md) Apparently trees
sprung from shoots, sprouts, aerial-roots, &c. are meant. They are
considered as a class different from those whose offshoots they are.

<span id="fn_1136"></span>[390:2](sbe4567.htm#fr_1144.md) One soul, *g*îva,
pervades the whole tree; it is the soul of the tree. Separate *g*îvas,
however, reside in the roots, &c.

<span id="fn_1137"></span>[390:3](sbe4567.htm#fr_1145.md) A*ggh*ôruha =
adhyârôha, explained in the Dîpikâ: vallîv*ri*ksha.

<span id="fn_1138"></span>[390:4](sbe4567.htm#fr_1146.md) T*rin*a.

<span id="fn_1139"></span>[391:1](sbe4567.htm#fr_1147.md) Ôsahi = Ôshadhi.

<span id="fn_1140"></span>[391:2](sbe4567.htm#fr_1148.md) Hariya = harita.

<span id="fn_1141"></span>[391:3](sbe4567.htm#fr_1149.md) All the
commentators say about the words Âya, &c. (which offer some various
readings in the MSS.), is that they denote particular plants
(vanaspativi*s*êsha) which must be learned from people (who know them).
I give the words in their Prâk*ri*t form, and do not attempt to
transpose them into Sanskrit.

<span id="fn_1142"></span>[391:4](sbe4567.htm#fr_1150.md) For there are no
Âyas originated by Âyas except through their seed.

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[391:5](sbe4567.htm#fr_1151.md) Avakâ, a grassy
plant growing in marshy land, Blyxa Octandra.

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[391:6](sbe4567.htm#fr_1152.md) *S*aivâla, the
aquatic plant Vallisneria.

<span id="fn_1145"></span>[391:7](sbe4567.htm#fr_1153.md) Kadamba, Nauclea
Kadamba.

<span id="fn_1146"></span>[391:8](sbe4567.htm#fr_1154.md) Ka*s*êru, Scirpus
Kysoor.

<span id="fn_1147"></span>[392:1](sbe4567.htm#fr_1155.md) The last four are
well-known varieties of lotus, called in Sanskrit: utpala, padma,
kumuda, nalina.

<span id="fn_1148"></span>[392:2](sbe4567.htm#fr_1156.md) The Sanskrit of
the last seven items is: pu*nd*arîka, mahâpu*nd*arîka, *s*atapattra,
sahasrapattra, kahlâra, kôkanada, and tâmarasa; they are all varieties
of lotus.

<span id="fn_1149"></span>[392:3](sbe4567.htm#fr_1157.md) Pushkara.

<span id="fn_1150"></span>[392:4](sbe4567.htm#fr_1160.md) This is to be
detailed in the same way as with trees and creepers.

<span id="fn_1151"></span>[393:1](sbe4567.htm#fr_1161.md) Compare note
[1](sbe4538.htm#fn_648), [p. 225](sbe4538.htm#page_225.md).

<span id="fn_1152"></span>[393:2](sbe4567.htm#fr_1162.md) Both are
indicated in the text by bî*g*a. According to *S*îlâṅka, a male will be
produced if the semen is in excess; a female, if the blood; a neuter, if
they are equally balanced.

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[393:3](sbe4567.htm#fr_1163.md) Avakâ*s*a.
According to *S*îlâṅka, a male is produced from the right side of the
womb, a female from the left, a neuter from both together.

<span id="fn_1154"></span>[393:4](sbe4567.htm#fr_1164.md) Ôyam = ô*g*as.

<span id="fn_1155"></span>[393:5](sbe4567.htm#fr_1165.md) Paliyâgam,
explained garbhaparipâka.

<span id="fn_1156"></span>[394:1](sbe4567.htm#fr_1166.md) See
Uttarâdhyayana XXXVI, 173; above, p. 223.

<span id="fn_1157"></span>[394:2](sbe4567.htm#fr_1167.md) Compare
Uttarâdhyayana XXXVI, 180, ibidem.

<span id="fn_1158"></span>[394:3](sbe4567.htm#fr_1168.md) A*g*agara,
literally serpents which devour goats.

<span id="fn_1159"></span>[394:4](sbe4567.htm#fr_1169.md) Mahôraga.
According to the Guzeratî gloss these snakes are a thousand yô*g*anas
long.

<span id="fn_1160"></span>[395:1](sbe4567.htm#fr_1170.md) G*ri*hakôkila,
probably identical with g*ri*hagôlika, a lizard.

<span id="fn_1161"></span>[395:2](sbe4567.htm#fr_1171.md) Vi*s*va*m*bhara
is given in the smaller Petersburg Dictionary as the name of a scorpion
or some similar animal. However, it must denote here some other animal.

<span id="fn_1162"></span>[395:3](sbe4567.htm#fr_1172.md) This may be
*k*atushpâdika, quadruped; but then the word must be taken in a
restricted sense, perhaps, small quadrupeds.

<span id="fn_1163"></span>[395:4](sbe4567.htm#fr_1173.md) See
Uttarâdhyayana XXXVI, 187; above, [p. 224](sbe4538.htm#page_224.md).
Perhaps beetles and butterflies are intended by the two last kinds of
pakshins?

<span id="fn_1164"></span>[395:5](sbe4567.htm#fr_1174.md) A*n*usûya =
anusûta or anusyûta.

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[395:6](sbe4567.htm#fr_1175.md) Durûvasa*m*bhava.

<span id="fn_1166"></span>[395:7](sbe4567.htm#fr_1176.md) Khuruduga.

<span id="fn_1167"></span>[396:1](sbe4567.htm#fr_1177.md) There is
apparently no predicate in this sentence.

<span id="fn_1168"></span>[396:2](sbe4567.htm#fr_1178.md) This paragraph
gives the 'scientific' explanation of the way by which water-bodies or
the bodies of water-lives are produced by wind.

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[397:1](sbe4567.htm#fr_1179.md) E.g. when two
bulls or elephants rush upon one another, sparks of fire are seen
issuing from their horns or teeth. Fire is produced when two pieces of
wood or stone are rubbed one against the other.

<span id="fn_1170"></span>[397:2](sbe4567.htm#fr_1180.md) According to the
commentators, earth-bodies are produced in the shape of precious stones,
in the head of snakes, of pearls in the teeth (sic) of elephants, and so
in reeds, &c.
