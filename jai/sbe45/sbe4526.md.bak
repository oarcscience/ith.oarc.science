### TWENTY-FOURTH LECTURE.

###### THE SAMITIS.

The eight articles <span id="fr_327"></span>[1](#fn_326.md) of the creed
are the Samitis and the Guptis; there are five Samitis and three Guptis.
(1)

The Samitis <span id="fr_328"></span>[2](#fn_327.md) are: 1. îryâ-samiti
(going by paths trodden by men, beasts, carts, &c., and looking
carefully so as not to occasion the death of any living creature); 2.
bhâshâ-samiti (gentle, salutary, sweet, righteous speech); 3.
êsha*n*â-samiti (receiving alms in a manner to avoid the forty-two
faults that are laid down); 4. âdâna-samiti (receiving and keeping of
the things necessary for

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

religious exercises, after having carefully examined them); 5.
u*kk*âra-samiti (performing the operations of nature in an unfrequented
place). The three Guptis (which are here included in the term Samiti in
its wider application) are: 1. mano-gupti (preventing the mind from
wandering in the forest of sensual pleasures by employing it in
contemplation, study, &c.); 2. vâg-gupti (preventing the tongue from
saying bad things by a vow of silence, &c.); 3. kâya-gupti (putting the
body in an immovable posture as in the case of Kâyôtsarga). (2)

The eight Samitis are thus briefly enumerated, in which the whole creed
taught by the *G*inas and set forth in the twelve Aṅgas, is
comprehended. (3)

1\. The walking of a well-disciplined monk should be pure in four
respects: in respect to 1. the cause <span
id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_328.md); 2. the time; 3. the road; 4. the
effort <span id="fr_330"></span>[2](#fn_329). (4.md)

The cause is: knowledge, faith, and right conduct; the time is day-time;
the road excludes bad ways. (5)

The effort is fourfold, viz. as regards: 1. substance, 2. place, 3.
time, and 4. condition of mind. Hear me explain them. (6)

With regard to substance: the (walking monk) should look with his eyes;
with regard to place: the space of a yuga (i.e. four hastas or cubits);
with regard to time: as long as he walks; and with regard to condition
of mind: carefully <span id="fr_331"></span>[3](#fn_330). (7.md)

He walks carefully who pays attention only to

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

his walk and his body (executing it), whilst he avoids attending to the
objects of sense, but (minds) his study, the latter in all five
ways <span id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_331). (8.md)

2\. To give way to: anger, pride, deceit and greed, laughter, fear,
loquacity and slander <span id="fr_333"></span>[2](#fn_332.md); these eight
faults should a well-disciplined monk avoid; he should use blameless and
concise speech at the proper time. (9, 10)

3\. As regards begging <span id="fr_334"></span>[3](#fn_333.md), a monk
should avoid the faults in the search <span
id="fr_335"></span>[4](#fn_334.md), in the receiving <span
id="fr_336"></span>[5](#fn_335.md), and in the use <span
id="fr_337"></span>[6](#fn_336.md) of the three kinds of objects, viz.
food, articles of use, and lodging. (11)

A zealous monk should avoid in the first (i.e. in the search for alms)
the faults occasioned either by the giver (udgama) or by the receiver
(utpâdana); in the second (i.e. in the receiving of alms) the faults
inherent in the receiving; and in the use of the articles received, the
four faults <span id="fr_338"></span>[7](#fn_337). (12.md)

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

4\. If a monk takes up or lays down the two kinds of things belonging to
his general and

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

supplementary <span id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_338.md) outfit, he should
proceed in the following way. (13)

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

A zealous monk should wipe the thing after having inspected it with his
eyes, and then he should take it up or put it down, having the Samiti in
both respects <span id="fr_340"></span>[2](#fn_339). (I 4.md)

5\. Excrements, urine, saliva, mucus, uncleanliness of the body, offals
of food, waste things, his own body (when he is about to die), and
everything of this description (is to be disposed of in the way to be
described). (15)

\[A place may be not frequented and not seen (by people), or not
frequented but seen, or frequented and not seen, or frequented and seen.
(16)\] <span id="fr_341"></span>[3](#fn_340.md)

In a place neither frequented nor seen by other people, which offers no
obstacles to self-control, which is even, not covered with grass or
leaves <span id="fr_342"></span>[4](#fn_341.md), and has

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

been brought into its present condition <span
id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_342.md) not long ago, which is spacious, has an
inanimate surface-layer <span id="fr_344"></span>[2](#fn_343.md), not too
near (the village, &c.), not perforated by holes, and is exempt from
insects and seeds--in such a place he should leave his excrements, &c.
(17, 18)

The five Samitis are thus briefly enumerated, I shall now explain in due
order the three Guptis <span id="fr_345"></span>[3](#fn_344). (19.md)

1\. There is, 1. truth; 2. untruth; 3. a mixture of truth and untruth;
4. a mixture of what is not true, and what is not untrue. The Gupti of
mind refers to all four <span id="fr_346"></span>[4](#fn_345). (20.md)

A zealous monk should prevent his mind from desires for the misfortune
of somebody else <span id="fr_347"></span>[5](#fn_346.md), from thoughts on
acts which cause misery to living beings <span
id="fr_348"></span>[6](#fn_347.md), and from thoughts on acts which cause
their destruction <span id="fr_349"></span>[7](#fn_348). (21.md)

2\. The Gupti of speech is also of four kinds (referring to the four
divisions as in verse 20). (22)

A zealous monk should prevent his speech from (expressing) desires, &c.
(as in verse 21). (23)

3\. In standing, sitting, lying down, jumping, going, and in the use of
his organs, a zealous monk should prevent his body from intimating
obnoxious desires,

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

from doing acts which cause misery to living beings, or which cause
their destruction. (24, 25)

These are the five Samitis for the practice of the religious life, and
the Guptis for the prevention of everything sinful. (26)

This is the essence of the creed, which a sage should thoroughly put
into practice; such a wise man will soon get beyond the Circle of
Births. (27)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_326"></span>[129:1](sbe4526.htm#fr_327.md) The word I have
rendered 'article' is mâyâ, the Sanskrit form of which may be mâtâ or
mâtrâ. The word is derived from the root mâ 'to find room in,' and
denotes that which includes in itself other things, see verse 3. The
word may also mean mât*ri* 'mother,' as Weber understands it. But this
is an obviously intentional double meaning.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[129:2](sbe4526.htm#fr_328.md) The definitions
placed in parentheses in the text are taken from Bhandarkar's Report for
1883-1884, p. 98, note †, p. 100, note \*.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[130:1](sbe4526.htm#fr_329.md) Âlambana, literally
support; explained: supported by which the mind becomes pure.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[130:2](sbe4526.htm#fr_330.md) *G*âya*n*â = yatna;
it consists chiefly in compassion with living creatures (*g*îvadayâ).

<span id="fn_330"></span>[130:3](sbe4526.htm#fr_331.md) Upayukta.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[131:1](sbe4526.htm#fr_332.md) The 'five ways' are
vâ*k*anâ, &c., as explained in the Twenty-ninth Lecture, §§ 39-23,
below, p. 165 f. The commentators supply kuryât 'he should carry on his
study.'

<span id="fn_332"></span>[131:2](sbe4526.htm#fr_333.md) Vikahâ = vikathâ,
which does not occur in common Sanskrit. Perhaps it stands for vikatthâ
'boasting.'

<span id="fn_333"></span>[131:3](sbe4526.htm#fr_334.md) Êsha*n*â.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[131:4](sbe4526.htm#fr_335.md) Gavêsha*n*â.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[131:5](sbe4526.htm#fr_336.md) Graha*n*aisha*n*â.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[131:6](sbe4526.htm#fr_337.md) Paribhôgaisha*n*â.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[131:7](sbe4526.htm#fr_338.md) There are
altogether forty-six faults to be avoided. As they are frequently
alluded to in the sacred texts, a systematical enumeration and
description of them according to the Dîpikâ will be useful.

There are sixteen udgama-dôshas by which food, &c. becomes unfit for a
*G*aina monk:

1\. Âdhâkarmika, the fault inherent in food, &c., which a layman has
prepared especially for religious mendicants of whatever sect.

2\. Auddê*s*ika, is food, &c., which a layman has prepared for a
particular monk.

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

3\. Pûtika, is food, &c., which is pure on the whole, but contains
particles impure on account of the first fault.

4\. Unmi*s*ra, is food, &c., of which a part only had been especially
prepared for the monk in question.

5\. Sthâpanâkarmika, is food, &c., which has been reserved for the monk.

6\. Prâbh*ri*tika, is food, &c., which has been prepared for some
festivity.

7\. Prâdu*h*kara*n*a, when the layman has to light a lamp in order to
fetch the alms for the monk.

8\. Krîta, when he has to buy the things.

9\. Prâmitya, when he has to fetch a ladle (? uddhâraka) in order to
draw out the food, &c.

10\. Parâv*ri*tti, when he replaces bad particles of the food by good
ones, and vice versa.

11\. Adhyâh*ri*ta, when he has to fetch the food, &c., from some
distance.

12\. Udbhinna, when he has to open locks before he gets at the food, &c.

13\. Mâlâh*ri*ta, when he has to take the food, &c., from some raised or
underground place.

14\. Â*kkh*idya, when the food, &c., was taken by force from somebody.

15\. Anis*ri*sh*t*a, when a man gives from a store he possesses in
common with other men, without asking their permission.

16\. Adhyavapûra, when the mendicant calls while the dinner is being
cooked, and for his sake more food is put in the pot on the fire.

(Some of these faults are enumerated in the Aupapâtika Sûtra, § 96,
III.)

There are sixteen utpâdana-dôshas; or such faults as are occasioned by
the monk's using some means to make the layman give him alms:

1\. Dhâtrîkarman, when the monk plays with the layman's children.

2\. Dûtakarman, when he gives him information about what his people are
doing.

3\. Nimitta, when he speaks in praise of almsgiving.

4\. Â*g*îvikâ, when he makes his birth and family known to him.

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

5\. Vapanîka, when he expatiates upon his misery.

6\. *K*ikitsâ, when he cures sick people.

7\. Krôdhapi*nd*a, when he extorts alms by threats.

8\. Mânapi*nd*a, when he tells the layman that he has laid a wager with
other monks that he would get alms from him.

9\. Mâyâpi*nd*a, when he employs tricks or buffoonery in order to
procure alms.

10\. Lôbhapi*nd*a, when he goes begging from a desire of good fare.

11\. Sa*m*stava-pi*nd*a, when he flatters the layman.

12\. Vidyâpi*nd*a, when he makes a show of his learning; or when he
conjures a god from whom to get alms.

13\. Mantradôsha, when he obliges the layman in some way or other.

14\. *K*ûr*n*ayôga, when he makes himself invisible and then takes away
the food, &c.

15\. Yôgapi*nd*a, when he teaches people spells, tricks, &c.

16\. Mûlakarman, when he teaches them how to obviate evils by roots,
charms, &c.

There are ten faults of graha*n*aisha*n*â:

1\. Saṅkita, when a monk accepts alms from a frightened layman.

2\. Mrakshita, when the food is soiled (khara*nt*ita) by animate or
inanimate matter.

3\. Nikshipta, when the food is placed among animate things.

4\. Pihita, when animate food is covered with inanimate matter, and vice
versa.

5\. Sa*m*h*ri*ta, when the layman has to take out the thing to be given
from one vessel and puts it into another.

6\. Dâyaka, when the condition or occupation of the giver forbids
accepting alms from him.

7\. Unmi*s*rita, when the layman mixes up pure with impure food.

8\. Aparita (?), when one joint possessor gives away from the store
against the other's will.

9\. Lipta, when the layman gives food, &c., with a ladle or his hand,
soiled with milk, butter, &c.

10\. *Kh*ardita, when in giving alms he spills milk, &c.

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

There are four faults of paribhôgaisha*n*â:

1\. Sa*m*yô*g*anâ, when the monk puts together the ingredients for a
good meal.

2\. Apramâ*n*a, when he accepts a greater than the prescribed quantity
of food.

3\. Iṅgâla, when he praises a rich man for his good fare, or dhûma, when
he blames a poor man for his bad fare.

4\. Akâra*n*a, when he eats choice food on other occasions than those
laid down in the sacred texts.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[133:1](sbe4526.htm#fr_339.md) See next page.
<span id="page_135">p. 135</span> Aughika and aupagrahika. The former is
explained sâmudâyika, the other denotes such things as are wanted
occasionally only, as a stick. I cannot make out with certainty from the
commentaries whether the broom is reckoned among the former or the
latter.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[134:2](sbe4526.htm#fr_340.md) This means,
according to the commentator, either in taking up or putting down, or
with respect to the ôgha and aupagrahika outfit, or with respect to
substance and condition of mind.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[134:3](sbe4526.htm#fr_341.md) This verse, which
is in a different metre (Âryâ), is apparently a later addition, and has
probably been taken from an old commentary, the *K*ûr*n*i or the
Bhâshya.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[134:4](sbe4526.htm#fr_342.md) A*ggh*usirê =
asushirê, not perforated, not having holes. I translate according to the
author of the Ava*k*ûri. The literal <span id="page_135">p. 135</span>
translation would give a wrong idea, as it would come to the same as the
word bilavar*g*ita in the next verse.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[135:1](sbe4526.htm#fr_343.md) I.e. where the
ground has been cleared not long ago by burning the grass, &c.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[135:2](sbe4526.htm#fr_344.md) Ôgâ*dh*ê, where the
animate ground is covered by at least five digits of inanimate matter.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[135:3](sbe4526.htm#fr_345.md) Viz. of mind (20,
21), of speech (22, 23), and of the body (24, 25).

<span id="fn_345"></span>[135:4](sbe4526.htm#fr_346.md) See part i, p. 150,
note 2.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[135:5](sbe4526.htm#fr_347.md) Sa*m*rambha.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[135:6](sbe4526.htm#fr_348.md) Samârambha.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[135:7](sbe4526.htm#fr_349.md) Ârambha.
