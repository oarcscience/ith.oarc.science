### THIRTY-FIRST LECTURE.

###### MODE OF LIFE <span id="fr_497"></span>[2](#fn_495.md).

I shall declare the mode of life that benefits the soul; by practising
it many souls have crossed the ocean of Sa*m*sâra. (1)

One should desist from one thing, and practise another: desist from
neglect of self-control, and practise self-control. (2)

Love and hatred are two evils which produce bad

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_495"></span>[180:2](sbe4533.htm#fr_497.md) This lecture offers
many difficulties to the translator, as it contains scarcely more than a
dry list of articles of the *G*aina faith. To fully understand or
interpret it would require an accurate knowledge of the complete
religious system of the *G*ainas, to which we can lay no claim at
present. The order in which the articles are given follows the number of
their subdivisions. In some cases the number is not given in the Sûtra,
but is supplied by the commentary.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[181:1](sbe4533.htm#fr_498.md) Compare XIX, 91,
and XXX, 3. Hurtful acts (da*nd*a) are threefold, as referring to
thoughts, words, and acts; conceited acts (gârava), as pride of riches,
of taste (rasa), and of pleasure or fashion (sâtâ); delusive acts
(*s*alya), as mâyâ, nidâna, and mithyâdar*s*ana.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[181:2](sbe4533.htm#fr_506.md) Vikatthâ.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[181:3](sbe4533.htm#fr_500.md) Sa*mgñ*â.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[181:4](sbe4533.htm#fr_501.md) Yatatê 'exerts
himself;' supply 'to avoid, to know, or to do,' as the case may require.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[181:5](sbe4533.htm#fr_502.md) Kriyâ; they are: 1.
kâyikî; 2. adhikara*n*ikî; 3. prâdvêshikî; 4. paritâpanikî, and 5.
prâ*n*âtipâtikî.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[181:6](sbe4533.htm#fr_503.md) On the lê*s*yâs see
Thirty-fourth Lecture, p. 196 ff.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[181:7](sbe4533.htm#fr_504.md) From the
commentaries I learn two more of these six kâra*n*as: vêdana and
vaiyâv*ri*tya. I cannot say which are the remaining three.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[181:8](sbe4533.htm#fr_505.md) They are enumerated
in note  <span id="fr_506"></span>[2](#fn_497.md) on XXX, 25, [p.
178](sbe4532.htm#page_178.md).

<span id="fn_504"></span>[182:1](sbe4533.htm#fr_507.md) Viz. caste, family,
beauty, &c.; see Sûtrak*ri*t. II, 2, 17.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[182:2](sbe4533.htm#fr_508.md) Brahmagupti. This
is of nine kinds.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[182:3](sbe4533.htm#fr_509.md) Bhikshudharma. It
consists of Nos. 46-49, 26, 27, of Lecture XXIX, truth, purity, poverty,
and chastity.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[182:4](sbe4533.htm#fr_510.md) The details given
in the commentary (Dêvêndra) partly differ from the description of the
twelve duties of *S*râvakas, and the ten duties of Bhikshus given by
Bhandarkar from the Kârttikêyânuprêkshâ, see his Report, p. 114 ff.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[182:5](sbe4533.htm#fr_511.md) Paramâdhârmika. My
translation is based on the enumeration of fifteen words, among which
the names of some well-known hells occur.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[182:6](sbe4533.htm#fr_512.md) The sixteen
lectures of the first part of the Sûtrak*ri*tâṅga, the last of which is
called Gâthâ, are meant by the sixteen Gâthâs. The whole book contains
twenty-three lectures as stated in verse 16.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[182:7](sbe4533.htm#fr_513.md) The first
*s*rutaskandha of the *Gñ*âtâdharmakathâ, which contains nineteen
adhyayanas, is intended by *gñ*âtâdhyayana.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[183:1](sbe4533.htm#fr_514.md) *S*abala, because
they 'variegate' the conduct. The actions meant are sitting on an
unwiped seat, &c.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[183:2](sbe4533.htm#fr_515.md) Parîsaha, see
above, [p. 9](sbe4504.htm#page_9.md) ff.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[183:3](sbe4533.htm#fr_516.md) Rûpa. The
twenty-four gods are: ten Bhavanapatis, eight Vyantaras, five
*G*yôtishkas, one Vaimânika; or the 24 prophets.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[183:4](sbe4533.htm#fr_517.md) Bhâvanâ, the
subdivisions of the five great vows, see part i, p. 189 ff.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[183:5](sbe4533.htm#fr_518.md) The
Da*s*â*s*rutaskandha, B*ri*hat Kalpa, and Vyavahâra Sûtras are meant,
which together contain twenty-six uddê*s*as.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[183:6](sbe4533.htm#fr_519.md) I.e. the Â*k*ârâṅga
Sûtra; it now contains but twenty-four lectures, but is said to have
originally contained four more, see part i, introduction, p. xlix f.
These four lectures were: Mahâparinnâ, Ugghâya, A*n*ugghâya, Ârôva*n*â.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[184:1](sbe4533.htm#fr_520.md) The pure operations
of mind, speech, and body.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[184:2](sbe4533.htm#fr_521.md) As far as I can
make out from the enumeration in the commentary, they are articles
regulating the intercourse between monks, especially pupils and teacher.
