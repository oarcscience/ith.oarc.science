### SECOND CHAPTER.

I shall now truly tell you another kind of perpetual suffering, how the
sinners who have committed crimes suffer for the deeds they have done in
their former lives. (1)

Tying their hands and feet the (punishers) cut open their belly with
razors and knives; taking hold of the mangled body of the sinner, they
forcibly tear the skin off his back. (2)

They cut off his arms at the armpits; they force his mouth wide open and
scald it; they yoke the sinner to a car and drive him, and growing
angry <span id="fr_840"></span>[1](#fn_834) they pierce his back with a
goad. (3)

The (sinners) walk over ground burning and glowing like red-hot iron;
scorched they shriek horribly, being urged on with arrows <span
id="fr_841"></span>[2](#fn_835) and put to a red-hot yoke. (4)

The sinners are driven over slippery ground which is like a road of
red-hot iron; in this dreadful place (the ministers of hell) make them
go forward like slaves (beating them) with sticks. (5)

Proceeding in this intolerable (hell) they are crushed by rocks tumbling
down. There is the

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (caldron)
Santâpanî <span id="fr_842"></span>[1](#fn_836), where evildoers suffer
for a long time. (6)

They throw the sinners into caldrons and boil them; scalded they rise
thence again; devilish crows <span id="fr_843"></span>[2](#fn_837) feed
on them and (so do) other beasts having claws devour them. (7)

There is a place of smokeless fire in the form of a pile <span
id="fr_844"></span>[3](#fn_838) where (the sinners) greatly distressed
shriek horribly; head downwards they are lacerated and cut into pieces
with iron knives. (8)

Tied up and skinned they are devoured by steel-nebbed birds; it is the
hell called Sa*mg*îvanî, where life is long, and where men of an evil
mind are tortured. (9)

The (punishers) pierce them with sharp pikes as people do with a
captured pig. Transfixed by a pike the (sinners) shriek horribly;
suffering both (bodily and mentally) they feel nothing but pains. (10)

There is a great place always on fire, where fires burn without fuel;
there for a long time stay the evildoers shrieking aloud. (11)

Setting on fire large piles, they thrust into them (a sinner) who will
cry horribly; as butter thrown in the fire melts, so does the evildoer
there. (12)

And there is an always crowded, hot place which one deserves for one's
great sins, and which is full of misery. There (the punishers) tie (the
sinner's)

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

hands and feet, and belabour him with sticks like an enemy. (13)

They break the sinner's back with a weapon, and smash his skull with
iron clubs; their bodies are split and sawn like a plank; and tortured
with red-hot awls (the sinners) are subjected (to cruelties). (14)

Cruel evildoers <span id="fr_845"></span>[1](#fn_839), urged on with
arrows, and put to work (by the punishers), carry burdens in the way of
elephants; two or three (punishers) get on one (victim) and growing
angry <span id="fr_846"></span>[2](#fn_840) hurt his vital parts. (15)

The sinners are driven over the large, slippery, and thorny ground;
tightly bound with straps <span id="fr_847"></span>[3](#fn_841) they
lose their senses; the revenging (punishers) cut them into pieces <span
id="fr_848"></span>[4](#fn_842), and throw them about like a
bali-sacrifice. (16)

There is a dreadful mountain towering high up in the air, called
Vaitâlika <span id="fr_849"></span>[5](#fn_843), where the evildoers are
tortured for more than a thousand hours. (17)

Tortured, the sinners shriek, suffering day and night; in this horrid,
great hell, which is full of implements of torture, they are put to a
cruel death. (18)

Full of wrath, like their enemies in a former life,

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the punishers)
crush them with hammers and clubs. With mangled bodies, and vomiting
blood, they fall to the ground, head foremost. (19)

There are the ever hungry <span id="fr_850"></span>[1](#fn_844), savage,
always wrathful, great jackals by whom the evildoers bound with shackles
are devoured. (20)

There is the dreadful, slimy river, which is always flowing and full of
molten iron; in this very dreadful river (the sinners) must descend one
by one <span id="fr_851"></span>[2](#fn_845). (21)

These pains are suffered without interruption by the sinner who stays
there for a long time. There is no escape from the torture; he must,
himself and alone, suffer the pains. (22)

Whatever cruelty he has done in a former birth, the same will be
inflicted on him in the Circle of Births. Having been born in an
extremely miserable state of life, the sufferer experiences infinite
pain. (23)

A wise man hearing of these hells should not kill any living being in
the whole world; believing in true doctrines and renouncing all property
he should know the world, but not become a slave to it. (24)

Knowing the endless Circle of Births <span
id="fr_852"></span>[3](#fn_846) with regard to animals, men, and gods,
and the reward they will get; knowing all this, (a wise man) should wait
for his decease, practising meanwhile self-control. (25)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_834"></span>[283:1](sbe4553.htm#fr_840) Ârussa = ârushya,
here and in a similar passage (verse 15) the commentators explain it,
'making him angry, exasperating him.' They have misunderstood raha*m*si
in the second line, rendering it rahasi; it is of course = rathê.

<span id="fn_835"></span>[283:2](sbe4553.htm#fr_841) Usu = ishu,
explained by âravi*s*êsha a kind of awl.'

<span id="fn_836"></span>[284:1](sbe4553.htm#fr_842) Or, it is (the
hell) called Santâpanî. My translation in the text agrees with
*S*îlâṅka's interpretation.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[284:2](sbe4553.htm#fr_843) Compare
Uttarâdhyayana XIX, 58, p. 95.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[284:3](sbe4553.htm#fr_844) Samûsiya*m* nâma.
This might also be rendered, 'called Samu*kkh*rita.' But the
commentators do not take samûsiya for a proper name.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[285:1](sbe4553.htm#fr_845) Ruddaasâhukammî =
raudra-asâdhu-karmâ*n*a*h*. *S*îlâṅka thinks that the ministers of hell
are meant; but then the verse will not construe.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[285:2](sbe4553.htm#fr_846) See note on verse
3.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[285:3](sbe4553.htm#fr_847) Vivaddhatappêhi*m*,
in a marginal gloss, explained: baddhvâ *k*armabandhanai*h*. But it
might also be viv*ri*ddhatâpai*h* under increased tortures.'

<span id="fn_842"></span>[285:4](sbe4553.htm#fr_848) Ko*tt*a =
ku*t*ayitvâ.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[285:5](sbe4553.htm#fr_849) Vêtâliya. The
commentators render it vaikriya 'produced by magic,' and moreover
explain the word as an epithet, not as a proper name.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[286:1](sbe4553.htm#fr_850) A*n*âsiyâ,
ana*s*itâ*h*. This might also be taken as the name of the jackals.

<span id="fn_845"></span>[286:2](sbe4553.htm#fr_851) Êgâyatâ, explained
êkakina*h*.

<span id="fn_846"></span>[286:3](sbe4553.htm#fr_852) *K*auranta.
