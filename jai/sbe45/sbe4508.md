### SIXTH LECTURE.

###### THE FALSE ASCETIC <span id="fr_104"></span>[2](#fn_103).

All men who are ignorant of the Truth are subject to pain; in the
endless Sa*m*sâra they suffer in many ways. (1)

Therefore a wise man, who considers well the ways that lead to
bondage <span id="fr_105"></span>[3](#fn_104) and birth, should

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

himself search for the truth, and be kind towards all creatures. (2)

'Mother, father, daughter-in-law, brother, wife, and sons will not be
able to help me, when I suffer for my own deeds <span
id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_105).' (3)

This truth should be taken to heart <span
id="fr_107"></span>[2](#fn_106) by a man of pure faith; he should
(therefore) cut off greed and love, and not hanker after his former
connections. (4)

Cows and horses, jewels and earrings, cattle, slaves and servants: all
these (possessions) you must give up in order to obtain the power of
changing your form at will. (5) <span id="fr_108"></span>[3](#fn_107)

Everything that happens to somebody, affects him personally; therefore,
knowing the creatures' love of their own self, do not deprive them of
their life, but cease from endangering and combating them. (6)

Seeing that to accept (presents) leads to hell, one should not accept
even a blade of grass; only to preserve one's life <span
id="fr_109"></span>[4](#fn_108) one should eat the food that is put in
one's own alms-bowl. (7)

Here some are of opinion that they will be delivered from all misery by
merely attending the teacher <span id="fr_110"></span>[5](#fn_109),
without abstaining from sins. (8)

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

Acknowledging the truth about bondage and liberation, but talking only,
not acting (in accordance with these tenets), they seek comfort for
themselves in mighty words. (9)

Clever talking will not work salvation; how should philosophical
instruction do it? Fools, though sinking lower and lower through their
sins, believe themselves to be wise men. (to)

They are (going) a long way in the endless Sa*m*sâra; therefore looking
out carefully one should wander about carefully <span
id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_110). (11)

Choosing what is beyond and above (this world, viz. liberation), one
should never desire (worldly objects), but sustain one's body only to be
able to annihilate one's Karman. (12)

Those will reap pains who, in thoughts, words, or acts, are attached to
their body, to colours, and to forms. (13)

Recognising the cause of Karman, one should wander about waiting for
one's death; (knowing) the permitted quantity of food and drink, one
should eat (such food as has been) prepared (by the householders for
their own consumption). (14)

An ascetic should not lay by any store, not even so little as the grease
(sticking to his alms-bowl); but as a bird with its plumage <span
id="fr_112"></span>[2](#fn_111), so he with his alms-bowl should wander
about without desires. (15)

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

Receiving alms in a manner to avoid faults <span
id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_112), and controlling one's self, one should
wander about in a village (&c.) without a fixed residence; careful among
the careless one should beg one's food. (16)

Thus has spoken the Arhat *Gñ*ât*ri*putra, the venerable native of
Vai*s*âlî <span id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_113), who possesses the
highest knowledge and who possesses the highest faith, who possesses (at
the same time) the highest knowledge and the highest faith. (17)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_103"></span>[24:2](sbe4508.htm#fr_104)
Khu*dd*âganiya*nth*i*gg*a*m* = Kshullakanirgranthîyam. Kshullaka
originally means 'small, young,' but I do not see that the contents of
this lecture support this translation, though the commentators would
seem to favour it.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[24:3](sbe4508.htm#fr_105) Dêvêndra here quotes
the following Sanskrit verse: Kalatraniga*d*a*m* dattvâ na
sa*m*tush*t*a*h* pra*g*âpatih \| bhûyô<sup>ऽ</sup>py apatyarûpê*n*a
dadâti gala*sri*ṅkhalam. The creator was not satisfied when he had given
(to man) the wife as a fetter, he added a chain round his neck in the
form of children.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[25:1](sbe4508.htm#fr_106) This verse recurs in
Sûtrak*ri*tâṅga I, 9, 5.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[25:2](sbe4508.htm#fr_107) Sapêhâê pâsê =
svaprêkshayâ pa*s*yêt, he should look at it with his mind or
reflectively. However sapêhâê is usually the absolute participle
samprêkshya. The meaning is the same in both cases.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[25:3](sbe4508.htm#fr_108) Some MSS. insert
here the following verse: 'Movables and immovables, corn, and furniture
can not deliver a man from pain, who is suffering for his deeds.'

<span id="fn_108"></span>[25:4](sbe4508.htm#fr_109) This is according to
the commentators the meaning of the word dôgu*ñkh*î = *g*ugupsin.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[25:5](sbe4508.htm#fr_110) Âyariya*m*
vidittâ*n*a*m*. The commentator makes this out <span id="page_26">p.
26</span> to mean: by learning only what right conduct (â*k*ârikam) is,
without living up to it. But it is obvious that the author intends a
censure upon the *Gñ*ânamârga.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[26:1](sbe4508.htm#fr_111) As usual this phrase
means: one should conduct one's self so as to commit no sin.

<span id="fn_111"></span>[26:2](sbe4508.htm#fr_112) There is a pun in
the original on the word patta, which means plumes (patra) and alms-bowl
(pâtra).

<span id="fn_112"></span>[27:1](sbe4508.htm#fr_113) This is the
êsha*n*âsamiti. On the samitis see below, Twelfth Lecture, 2.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[27:2](sbe4508.htm#fr_114) Vêsaliê =
Vai*s*âlîka. See my remarks on this statement in part i, introduction,
p. xi, and Hoernle's notes in his translation of the Uvâsaga Dasâo, p. 3
ff.
