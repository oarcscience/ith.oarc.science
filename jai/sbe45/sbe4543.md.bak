## SECOND LECTURE <span id="fr_731"></span>[1](#fn_727.md),

###### CALLED

###### THE DESTRUCTION OF KARMAN.

### FIRST CHAPTER.

(*Ri*shabha said to his sons):

Acquire perfect knowledge of the Law! why do you not study it? It is
difficult to obtain instruction in it after this life. The days (that
are gone by) will never return, nor is it easy a second time to obtain
human birth. (1)

See, young and old men, even children in the mother's womb die. As a
hawk catches a quail, so (life) will end when its time is spent <span
id="fr_732"></span>[2](#fn_728). (2.md)

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

(A man) may suffer for the sake of his parents; he will not easily
obtain happiness after this life. A pious man should consider these
causes of danger and cease to act. (3)

For in this world living beings suffer individually for their deeds; for
the deed they have done themselves, they obtain (punishment), and will
not get over it before they have felt it. (4)

Even gods, Gandharvas, Râkshasas, and Asuras; animals who live on earth,
and snakes; kings, common people, merchants, and Brâhma*n*as: they all
must leave their rank and suffer. (5)

Notwithstanding their pleasures and relations, all men must suffer in
due time the fruit of their works; as a cocoa-nut detaching itself from
its stalk (falls down), so (life) will end when its time is spent. (6)

Even a very learned or virtuous man, or a Brâhma*n*a or an ascetic, will
be severely punished for his deed when he is given to actions of
deceit <span id="fr_733"></span>[1](#fn_729). (7.md)

See, those (heretics) who search for the knowledge of truth, but who do
not cross the Sa*m*sâra, talk only about the highest good (without
reaching it).

How will you understand what is near you and what is beyond <span
id="fr_734"></span>[2](#fn_730.md)? In the meanwhile you suffer for your
deeds. (8)

He who walks about naked and lean, he who eats only once after a month,
if he is filled with deceit, will be born an endless number of times.
(9)

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

Man, cease from sins! For the life of men will come to an end <span
id="fr_735"></span>[1](#fn_731.md). Men who are drowned (in lust, as it
were), and addicted to pleasure will, for want of control, be
deluded <span id="fr_736"></span>[2](#fn_732). (10.md)

Exert and control yourself! For it is not easy to walk on ways where
there are minutely small animals. Follow the commandments which the
Arhats have well proclaimed <span id="fr_737"></span>[3](#fn_733). (11.md)

Heroes (of faith) who desist (from sins) and exert themselves aright,
who subdue wrath, fear, &c., will never kill living beings; they desist
from sins and are entirely happy. (12)

It is not myself alone who suffers, all creatures in the world suffer;
this a wise man <span id="fr_738"></span>[4](#fn_734.md) should consider,
and he should patiently bear (such calamities) as befall him, without
giving way to his passions. (13)

As a wall covered with a plastering (of dried cowdung) <span
id="fr_739"></span>[5](#fn_735) is by a shock made thin, so (a monk.md)
should make his body lean by fasting, &c. He should

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

abstain from slaughter of living beings. This is the Law proclaimed by
the Sage. (14)

As a bird covered with dust removes the grey powder by shaking itself,
so a worthy and austere Brâhma*n*a <span
id="fr_740"></span>[1](#fn_736.md), who does penance, annihilates his
Karman. (15)

Young and old people claim a houseless *S*rama*n*a as their own, though
he begs according to the Law, observes the rules of conduct, and
performs austerities. People will even cry themselves hoarse, but they
will not captivate him. (16)

Whatever they will do to move his pity, however they will cry about
their son, they will not captivate a worthy and virtuous monk or make
him return to domestic life. (17)

Though they tempt him with pleasures, and though they should bind him
and carry him home, if he does not care for a (worldly) life, they will
not captivate him or make him return to domestic life. (18)

His father and mother, his children and wife who claim him, will
admonish him: 'See, you are our supporter; care not for the next world
in order to support us.' (19)

Some people are (foolishly) attached to others, and are thereby deluded;
the unrighteous make them adopt unrighteousness, and they exult in their
wickedness. (20)

Therefore a worthy and wise man should be

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

careful, ceasing from sin and being entirely happy. The virtuous heroes
of faith (have chosen) the great road, the right and certain path to
perfection. (21)

He who has entered the road leading to the destruction (of Karman) <span
id="fr_741"></span>[1](#fn_737.md), who controls his mind, speech, and
body, who has given up his possessions and relations and all
undertakings, should walk about subduing his senses. (22)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_727"></span>[249:1](sbe4543.htm#fr_731.md) The name of this
lecture, which occurs in its last line, is vêyâlîya, because, as the
author of the Niryukti remarks, it treats on vidârika, destruction (of
Karman), and because it is composed in the Vaitâlîya metre. For either
word, vaidârika (or rather vaidâlika, cf. karmavidalana) and vaitâlîya
may, in *G*aina Prâk*ri*t, become vêyâlîya or vêtâlîya. A play of words
was apparently intended; it would have been impossible, if both words
had not become identical in sound. We may, therefore, conclude that the
language of the author obeyed the same phonetic laws as the *G*aina
Prâk*ri*t exhibited in our MSS., or in other words, that the text has
been written down in about the same language in which it was originally
composed. The name of the Fifteenth Lecture leads to the same inference;
for it is called *g*amaîya (yamakîya) because each of its verses
contains the verbal ornament called yamaka, and because it opens with
the words *g*am aîya*m* (yad atîtam).

<span id="fn_728"></span>[249:2](sbe4543.htm#fr_732.md) One MS. here
inserts *g*îvâ*n*a *g*iviya*m*, the life of living beings.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[250:1](sbe4543.htm#fr_733.md) Abhinûma.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[250:2](sbe4543.htm#fr_734.md) According to
*S*îlâṅka, this world and the next, or domestic life and monachism, or
the Sa*m*sâra and Môksha are meant by the expression 'what is near you
and what is beyond.'

<span id="fn_731"></span>[251:1](sbe4543.htm#fr_735.md) Paliyantam. Another
explanation of this word, preferred by the commentators, is palyôpamasya
antar: within, i.e. something shorter than a Palyôpamâ.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[251:2](sbe4543.htm#fr_736.md) Or, acquire Karman
which is to result in delusion.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[251:3](sbe4543.htm#fr_737.md) According to the
commentators: practise (control) according to the sâsana (i.e. sûtras);
this has been well declared by the Arhats.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[251:4](sbe4543.htm#fr_738.md) Sahie. This word is
explained sometimes by svahita, intent on his spiritual welfare,
sometimes by hitena *gñ*ânâdinâ sahita*h*, possessed of knowledge, &c. I
translate it 'wise,' and derive the word from Sanskrit sah*ri*daya, the
correct Prâk*ri*t for which would be sahiyae.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[251:5](sbe4543.htm#fr_739.md) Cow-dung is stuck,
in the form of flat round cakes, against a wall to dry there. When the
cakes are dried a little shake is sufficient to make them come down,
whereby the wall will be restored to its original shape and dimensions.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[252:1](sbe4543.htm#fr_740.md) Mâha*n*a =
brâhma*n*a. The commentator derives the word from mâ and root han! The
word is a synonym of muni, with which it frequently occurs in the same
verse and has then been left out in the translation.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[253:1](sbe4543.htm#fr_741.md) Vêyâliya-maggam.
