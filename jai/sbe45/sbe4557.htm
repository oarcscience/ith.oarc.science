<p>What is the Law that has been preached by the wise Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_892"></A><A HREF="#fn_885"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (i.e. Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra)? Learn from me the noble Law of the <I>G</I>inas as it is. (1)</p>  
<p>Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, Kshattriyas, Vai<I>s</I>yas, <I>K</I>&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>&acirc;las, Vukkasas, hunters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_886"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, merchants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_887"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras, and others who are accustomed to do acts; (2)</p>  
<p>The iniquity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_888"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of all these men who cling to property goes on increasing; for those who procure themselves pleasures by sinful acts will not get rid of misery. (3)</p>  
<p>After a man has done acts which cause the death of living beings, his pleasure-seeking relations take possession of his wealth, whilst the doer of the acts must suffer for them. (4)</p>  
<p>'Mother, father, daughter-in-law, brother, wife, and sons will not be able to help me, when I suffer for my own deeds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_889"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.' (5)</p>

<p>Taking to heart this truth from which flow the most important truths, a monk, without property and without egoism, should follow the teaching of the <I>G</I>inas. (6)</p>  
<p>Leaving his wealth, sons, relations, and property, leaving sorrow that never ceases, (a monk) should wander about without any worldly interests. (7)</p>  
<p>Earth, water, fire, and wind; grass, trees, and corn; oviparous animals, the two kinds of viviparous&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> animals; beings engendered in fluids and in dirt, and plants; (8)</p>  
<p>These six classes of living beings a wise man should know and treat tenderly, in thoughts, words, and acts; he should neither do actions nor desire property whereby he might do them any harm. (9)</p>  
<p>Untrue speech, sexual intercourse, personal property, taking things that are not freely given: all these causes of injury to living beings a wise man should abstain from. (10)</p>  
<p>Deceit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, greed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_899"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, anger&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and pride&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>: combat these causes of sin; a wise man should abstain from them. (11)</p>  
<p>Washing, dyeing, making urine, evacuation of the bowels, vomiting, anointing of the eyes, and whatever is contrary to the rules of conduct&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_902"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>: from all this a wise man should abstain. (12)</p>

<p>Perfumes, wreaths, bathing, cleansing of the teeth, property, actions referring to women: from all this a wise man should abstain. (13)</p>  
<p>Alms that have been prepared, or bought, or stolen, or brought for the sake of a monk, or alms that contain particles of the above mentioned, or such alms as are unacceptable (for one cause or other), from all these a wise man should abstain. (14)</p>  
<p>Invigorating food, anointing of the eyes, greed, damaging others, washing (one's limbs), (rubbing them with) L&ocirc;dhra-powder, &amp;c.: from all this a wise man should abstain. (15)</p>  
<p>Deliberating with laymen, praising their work, answering their questions, eating the householder's meals: from all this a wise man should abstain. (16)</p>  
<p>He should not learn to play chess&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_903"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he should not speak anything forbidden by the Law; a wise man should abstain from fights and quarrels. (17)</p>  
<p>Shoes, an umbrella, dice, chowries, working for another, helping each other: from all this a wise man should abstain. (18)</p>  
<p>A monk should not void his excrements or urine among plants; he should never rinse his mouth (even) with distilled water after having removed (everything endowed with life). (19)</p>  
<p>He should never eat or drink out of a householder's vessel; nor wear his clothes, especially if he</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="green">p. 304</font></A></p>  
<p>is a naked monk: from all this a wise man should abstain. (20)</p>  
<p>A stool or bed or a seat in a house, asking of news and recollection (of past sports): from all this a wise man should abstain. (21)</p>  
<p>Fame, glory, and renown; honours and respectful treatment; all pleasures in the whole world: from all this a wise man should abstain. (22)</p>  
<p>A monk (should be content) with such food and drink as will sustain his life; he should give a portion of it to others: [from all this a wise man should abstain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_904"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.] (23)</p>  
<p>Thus spoke the Nirgrantha, the great sage Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra; he who possesses infinite knowledge and faith has taught the Law and the sacred texts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_905"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (24)</p>  
<p>In speaking (a monk) should use as few words as possible; he should not delight in another's foibles; he should avoid deceiving speech&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_906"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and should answer after ripe reflection. (25)</p>  
<p>One will repent of having used the third kind of speech&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_907"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; a secret should not be made known. This is the Nirgrantha's commandment. (26)</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="green">p. 305</font></A></p>  
<p>(A monk) should not call one names&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_908"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, nor <font size="-1" color="green">'</font>friend,' nor by his G&ocirc;tra; 'thou, thou' is vulgar; never address one by 'thou!' (27)</p>  
<p>A virtuous monk should never keep company (with the wicked); for thereby he incurs dangers (for his conduct) disguised as pleasures. A wise man should be aware of them. (28)</p>  
<p>(A monk) should not stay in the house of a householder except by constraint; nor should he amuse himself too long (by looking) at the sports of the children of the village&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_909"></A><A HREF="#fn_902"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. (29)</p>  
<p>Not desirous of fine things, he should wander about, exerting himself; not careless in his conduct, he should bear whatever pains he has to suffer. (30)</p>  
<p>If beaten, he should not be angry; if abused, he should not fly into a passion; with a placid mind he should bear everything and not make a great noise. (31)</p>  
<p>He should not enjoy pleasures though they offer themselves; for thus he is said (to reach) discernment. He should always practise what is right to do in the presence of the enlightened ones. (32)</p>  
<p>He should obey and serve a wise and pious teacher, (such teachers) as are heroes (of faith), who search for the benefit of their souls, are firm in control, and subdue their senses. (33)</p>  
<p>These men, who do not see the light (as it were) in domestic life, are the beloved of the people; these heroes, free from bondage, do not desire life. (34)</p>  
<p>

</p>  
<p><a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="green">p. 306</font></A></p>  
<p>They do not long for sensual pleasures, they do not engage in works. All that (the heretics) always talk about, is opposed to the right faith. (35)</p>  
<p>Excessive pride and deceit, all worldly vanities: all this a wise man knows and renounces, and thus brings about his final Liberation. (36)</p>  
<p>Thus I say.</p>

This does not necessarily, in this place, mean chess-board, but any game played on a similar chequered board may be intended. The earliest unmistakable mention of chess, that I have met with, occurs in Ratn&acirc;kara's Haravi<I>g</I>aya XII, 9, a mah&acirc;k&acirc;vya written in the first half of the ninth century A.
