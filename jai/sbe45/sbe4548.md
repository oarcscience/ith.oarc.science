### THIRD CHAPTER.

As at the time of the battle the coward looks behind him for a ditch,
thicket, or other hiding-place <span id="fr_780"></span>[1](#fn_774),
(thinking that) nobody knows who will win; (1)

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

'A moment's moment will bring the decision <span
id="fr_781"></span>[1](#fn_775); when we lose, we shall fly.' Thus
thinks the coward. (2)

So some *S*rama*n*as, knowing themselves to be weak, have recourse to
worldly sciences <span id="fr_782"></span>[2](#fn_776) when they see
that they will suffer want. (3)

(They say): 'Who knows what will cause my loss of sanctity, women or
water? When we are questioned, we shall speak out (i.e. show our
knowledge). We have no (other) resource (in case of need)!' (4)

They are cautious, like those who look out for a ditch, &c. Those who
doubt (their ability for control) are like men ignorant of the way. (5)

But famous warriors, leaders of heroes at the time of the battle, do not
look behind them; (they think) what if all end with death? (6)

A monk who exerts himself in a similar way, should slip off the ties
that bind him to his house. Putting aside all undertakings, he should
wander about for the welfare of his soul. (7)

Some revile a monk who leads a holy life. But these revilers are far off
from perfection <span id="fr_783"></span>[3](#fn_777). (8)

(The revilers say), 'You live just as the laymen do, being attached to
one another, for (e.g.) you beg alms for a sick man and give it him. (9)

'Therefore you still have an attachment, being obedient to the will of
one another; you have not the purity produced by the right path, and
have not got beyond the Circle of Births.' (10)

Now a monk who knows (the truth about) Môksha

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

should answer them <span id="fr_784"></span>[1](#fn_778): 'You speak
thus, wavering between two ways of life (viz, that of householders and
monks). (11)

'You eat out of the vessels <span id="fr_785"></span>[2](#fn_779) (of
householders, and make them) bring food for a sick brother; you eat
seeds and drink cold water <span id="fr_786"></span>[3](#fn_780), and
what has been especially prepared (for you when sick). (12)

'You are infected by great faults, you are void of discrimination, and
your resolutions are bad. It is not good to scratch a wound too much,
for it will grow worse <span id="fr_787"></span>[4](#fn_781).' (13)

They should be instructed in the truth by one who knows it and is free
from passions <span id="fr_788"></span>[5](#fn_782): 'Yours is not the
right way, you speak and act without consideration. (14)

'This your talk is weak, like the top of a bamboo, (when you say: a sick
brother) may eat the food brought by a householder, but not that brought
by a monk! (15)

'(And when you say that) our religious precepts are wholesome only for
householders (not for monks, we reply that our prophet had) no such
(inconsistent) ideas when he taught (his Law).' (16)

When (these heretics) cannot prove (their assertion) by any arguments
they give up the discussion, and fall back on their bold (assertion).
(17)

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

Overcome by their passions and infected by untruth, (these men) have
recourse to bad language, as the (savage) *T*aṅkana <span
id="fr_789"></span>[1](#fn_783) (when beaten) have recourse to their
hills. (18)

The argumentation of a monk whose mind is at rest <span
id="fr_790"></span>[2](#fn_784) should possess many good qualities. He
should proceed in such a way as not to exasperate his opponent. (19)

Following this Law which has been proclaimed by the Kâ*s*yapa, a sound
monk should carefully attend a sick brother. (20)

Knowing the beautiful Law, a wise and thoroughly restrained monk should
bear all hardships and wander about till he reaches final liberation.
(21)

Thus I say.
