### SIXTEENTH LECTURE.

###### THE TEN CONDITIONS OF PERFECT CHASTITY.

O long-lived (Gambûsvâmin)! I (Sudharman) have heard the following
Discourse from the Venerable (Mahâvîra):

Here <span id="fr_197"></span>[1](#fn_196.md), indeed, the venerable
Sthaviras have declared ten conditions for the realisation of celibacy,
by hearing and understanding which the monks will reach a high degree of
self-discipline, of Sa*m*vara <span id="fr_198"></span>[2](#fn_197.md), and
of contemplation, will be well protected (by the three Guptis), will
guard their senses, guard their chastity, and will thus never be remiss
(in the attendance on their religious duties).

What, then, are those ten conditions for the realisation of celibacy as
declared by the venerable Sthaviras, by hearing and understanding which
the monks will reach a high degree of self-discipline, of

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sa*m*vara, and of
contemplation, will be well protected (by the three Guptis), will guard
their senses, guard their chastity, and will thus never be remiss (in
the attendance on their religious duties)?

These, then, are the ten conditions for the realisation of celibacy, &c.
(all down to) duties.

1\. A Nirgrantha may occupy various places for sleep or rest <span
id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_198.md); but a Nirgrantha should not occupy
places, for sleep or rest, frequented by women, cattle, or eunuchs. The
preceptor has explained the reason for this. If a Nirgrantha occupies
places for sleep or rest, frequented by women, cattle, or eunuchs, then,
though he be chaste, there may arise a doubt with regard to his
chastity, or a sensual desire, or a feeling of remorse, or he will break
the rules, or he will become a slave to passion, or he will acquire a
dangerous illness of long duration, or he will desert the faith which
the Kêvalin has proclaimed. Therefore a Nirgrantha should not occupy
places, for sleep or rest, frequented by women, cattle, or eunuchs.

2\. A Nirgrantha should not converse with women <span
id="fr_200"></span>[2](#fn_199.md). The preceptor has explained the reason
for this. If a Nirgrantha converses with women, &c. (all as above).

3\. A Nirgrantha should not sit together with women on the same seat.
The preceptor has explained the reason for this. If a Nirgrantha sits on
the same seat with women, &c. (all as above).

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

4\. A Nirgrantha should not look at, or contemplate, the charms and
beauties of women. (The rest similar as above.)

5\. A Nirgrantha should not, behind a screen, or curtain, or wall,
listen to the screeching or screaming or singing or laughing or giggling
or crying of women. (The rest similar as above.)

6\. A Nirgrantha should not recall to his memory the pleasure and
amusements which in the past he enjoyed together with women. (The rest
similar as above.)

7\. A Nirgrantha should not eat well-dressed food. (The rest similar as
above.)

8\. A Nirgrantha should not eat or drink to excess. (The rest similar as
above.)

9\. A Nirgrantha should not wear ornaments. The preceptor has explained
the reason for this. If he wears ornaments, or adorns his body, he might
become an object of desire to women. When he is an object of desire to
women, then, &c. (the rest as in 1).

10\. A Nirgrantha should not care for sounds, colours, tastes, smells,
and feelings. (The rest similar as above.)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here are some verses (to the same effect) <span
id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_200.md):

A monk should take up a detached lodging, free from, and not frequented
by women, to preserve his chastity. (1)

A chaste monk should avoid talking with women, which delights the mind
and foments love and passion. (2)

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

A chaste monk should always avoid the company of, and frequent
conversation with women. (3)

A chaste monk should avoid observing the body, limbs, and figure of
women, their pleasant prattle and oglings. (4)

A chaste monk should avoid listening to the screeching, screaming,
singing, laughing, giggling, and crying of women. (5)

A chaste monk should never recall to his mind how he had laughed and
played with women, and had enjoyed them, how they became jealous, and
what tricks he played to frighten them. (6)

A chaste monk should always avoid well-dressed food and drink which will
soon raise his sensuality. (7)

A chaste monk should always eat his food, collected according to the
rules, for the sustenance of life, in the prescribed quantity, and at
the right time; concentrated in his thoughts he should not eat to
excess. (8)

A chaste monk should abstain from ornaments, he should not adorn his
body after the fashion of amorous people. (9)

He should always abstain from the five orders of pleasant things:
sounds, colours, smells, tastes, and feelings of touch. (10)

A lodging frequented by women, their pleasant talk, their company, and
looking at their charms; (11)

Their screeching, screaming, singing, and laughing, eating and sleeping
together with them; well-dressed food and drink, or partaking of them to
excess; (12)

And ornaments and finery <span id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_201.md): these
pleasant things,

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

which are hard to leave, are like the poison Tâlapu*t*a <span
id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_202.md), for a man who seeks after the true
Self. (13)

He should, once for all, abandon pleasant things which are hard to
leave; and concentrated in his thoughts he should avoid whatever casts a
doubt on his chastity. (14)

A monk should be the steadfast charioteer, as it were, of the Law in the
park of the Law <span id="fr_204"></span>[2](#fn_203.md), a vessel of
righteousness, content, restrained, attentive to the duties of a chaste
monk. (15)

The gods, Dânavas, Gandharvas, Yakshas, Râkshasas, and Kinnaras pay
homage to a chaste monk who performs his difficult duties. (16)

This unchangeable, permanent, and eternal Law has been proclaimed by the
*G*inas; through it the Siddhas have reached perfection, and others will
reach it. (17)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_196"></span>[73:1](sbe4518.htm#fr_197.md) The word 'here' is
explained as meaning 'in this religion of the *G*ainas.' See [p.
8](sbe4503.htm#page_8), note [5](sbe4504.htm#fn_74.md).

<span id="fn_197"></span>[73:2](sbe4518.htm#fr_198.md) Sa*m*vara is the
stopping of the âsravas by means of the Samitis and Guptis, see above,
[p. 55](sbe4514.htm#page_55), note [1](sbe4514.htm#fn_165.md).

<span id="fn_198"></span>[74:1](sbe4518.htm#fr_199.md) Literally, beds and
seats.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[74:2](sbe4518.htm#fr_200.md) This might also be
rendered: he should not talk about women.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[75:1](sbe4518.htm#fr_201.md) The preceding part
of this lecture is in prose.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[76:1](sbe4518.htm#fr_202.md) I*tth*a*m* *k*a,
i.e. ish*t*a*m* *k*a. The commentators connect the <span id="page_77">p.
77</span> words with the second part of the sentence. By giving to *k*a
the meaning of api they interpret the two words in question as meaning
'though very pleasant.'

<span id="fn_202"></span>[77:1](sbe4518.htm#fr_203.md) Tâlau*d*a. According
to the Dîpikâ it is a poison which kills by merely touching the palate
(tâlukaspar*s*anamâtrâd êva); but this is a mere guess prompted by a
wrong etymology. Tâlau*d*a stands perhaps for tâlakû*t*a, which may have
been a variant of kâlakû*t*a, the deadly poison swallowed by *S*iva.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[77:2](sbe4518.htm#fr_204.md) Here we have twice
the same word dhammârâmê, which <span id="page_78">p. 78</span> I have
once translated 'park of the Law,' and then 'vessel of righteousness.'
It is obvious that a play on this word is intended, though I may have
failed to hit the meaning of the author.
