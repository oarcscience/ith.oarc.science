### TWENTY-SEVENTH LECTURE.

###### THE BAD BULLOCKS.

There was a Sthavira and Ga*n*adhara <span
id="fr_387"></span>[1](#fn_386.md), the learned sage Garga. This leader of
the Ga*n*a once made the following reflections: (1)

'He who rides in a car, crosses a wilderness; he

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

who rides, as it were, in (the car of) religious exercise, crosses the
Sa*m*sâra. (2)

'But he who puts bad bullocks <span id="fr_388"></span>[1](#fn_387.md)
before his car, will be tired out with beating them; he will feel
vexation, and his goad will be broken (at last). (3)

'(A bad bullock) will bite its mate in the tail; it will wound the
other <span id="fr_389"></span>[2](#fn_388.md); it will break the pin of
the yoke <span id="fr_390"></span>[3](#fn_389.md), or it will leave the
road. (4)

'It will fall down on its side, or sit down, or lie down; it will jump
up or caper, or it will obstinately make for a young cow. (5)

'It will furiously advance with its head lowered for an attack, or
angrily go backward; it will stand still as if dead, or run at full
speed. (6)

'The cursed beast <span id="fr_391"></span>[4](#fn_390.md) will rend
asunder the rope, or in its unruliness break the yoke; and roaring it
will break loose and run off. (7)

'Just as bad bullocks are when put before a car, so are bad pupils when
yoked, as it were, to the car of the Law; they break down through want
of zeal. (8)

'Some attach great importance <span id="fr_392"></span>[5](#fn_391.md) to
their success;

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

some to their good fare; some to their comfort; some nurse their anger.
(9)

'Some are averse to begging; some are afraid of insults and are stuck
up; (how can) I convince them by reasons and arguments <span
id="fr_393"></span>[1](#fn_392) (?) (10.md)

'(A bad pupil) makes objections, and points out (imagined) difficulties;
he frequently acts in opposition to the words of the superiors. (11)

'(He will say if sent to a lady): "She does not know me, she will give
me nothing; I suppose she will be gone out; send some other monk there."
(12)

'If sent on an errand, they do not do what they were bidden <span
id="fr_394"></span>[2](#fn_393.md), but stroll about wherever they like; or
deporting themselves like servants of the king <span
id="fr_395"></span>[3](#fn_394.md), they knit their brows (when speaking to
other people). (13)

'After they have been instructed, admitted into the order, and nourished
with food and drink, they disperse in all directions like geese whose
wings have grown.' (14)

Now this driver (viz. Garga), who had to deal with bad bullocks,
thought: 'What have I to do with bad pupils? I am disheartened. (15)

'As are bad pupils, so are bad bullocks; I shall leave these lazy
donkeys, and shall practise severe austerities.' (16)

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

That noble man, who was full of kindness, grave, and always meditating,
wandered about on the earth, leading a virtuous life. (17)

Thus I say.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_386"></span>[149:1](sbe4529.htm#fr_387.md) Ga*n*a seems to
correspond to the modern Ga*kkh*a; see part i, p. 288, note 2.
Ga*n*adhara, therefore, does not denote here, as usual, a disciple of
Tîrthakara.

<span id="fn_387"></span>[150:1](sbe4529.htm#fr_388.md) Khalu*m*ka =
galiv*ri*shabha. Gali is explained in the dictionaries: a strong but
lazy bull. In verse 16 we meet with galigaddaha = galigardabha, as
synonymous with khalu*m*ka.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[150:2](sbe4529.htm#fr_389.md) The commentator
understands the first line of this verse as having reference to the
angry driver. But though an angry driver will perhaps, for all I know,
put his bullock's tail to his teeth, still it is harder to supply
another subject in the first line than in the second, and in the
following verses.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[150:3](sbe4529.htm#fr_390.md) Samilâ =
yugarandhrakîlaka, Ava*k*ûri.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[150:4](sbe4529.htm#fr_391.md) *Kh*imâla = *g*âra,
see Hêma*k*andra, Dê*s*î Kôsha 3, 27. It is a coarse term, which I
replace by another, though probably the language of our coach-drivers
might supply us with a more idiomatic rendering.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[150:5](sbe4529.htm#fr_392.md) Gârava, cf. [p.
98](sbe4521.htm#page_98), note [2](sbe4521.htm#fn_257.md).

<span id="fn_392"></span>[151:1](sbe4529.htm#fr_393.md) The metre of this
verse seems to have originally been Âryâ, but an attempt has been made
to change it into Anush*t*ubh. We meet here with the interesting form
a*n*usâsammî (read a*n*usasammi) = anu*s*âsmi.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[151:2](sbe4529.htm#fr_394.md) This seems to be
the meaning of the word paliu*mk*anti. The commentators say, after other
explanations, that they pretend not to have met the person to whom they
were sent.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[151:3](sbe4529.htm#fr_395.md) Râ*g*ave*tth*i*m*
va mannantâ; ve*tth*i = vish*t*i, hire.
