### The Alerion

is a heraldic bird, represented as an eaglet displayed, but without beak
or claws. Some writers confound it with the martlet, stating that the
alerion

Heraldic Eagle.](img/18800.jpg.md)

is the same bird with its wings displayed or extended. They are first
found in the arms of Lorraine, which are blazoned *or, on a bend gules,
three Alerions argent*, and are said to be assumed in commemoration of
an extraordinary shot made by Godfrey de Boulogne, "who at one draught
of his bow, shooting against David's Tower in Jerusalem, broched three
feetless birds called Alerions, which the House of Lorraine,

decending from his race, continued to this day." It is impossible, says
Planché, who broached this wonderful story, but it is perfectly evident
that the narrator was the party who drew the longbow, and not the noble
Godfrey.

The letters of the word <span class="smallcaps">Alerion</span> appear to
be merely an anagram formed by the same letters <span
class="smallcaps">Loraine</span>, and may account for the birds on the
shield (probably eaglets) being called alerions.

The eagle displayed and the two-headed eagle are but extreme
conventionalised representations of the natural bird.
