### The Heraldic Dragon

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> mythical dragon is represented in
heraldic art with the huge body of the reptile saurian type covered with
impenetrable mail of plates and scales, a row of formidable spines
extending from his head to his tail, which ends in a great and deadly
sting; his enormous jaws, gaping and bristling with hideous fangs, belch
forth sparks and flame; his round luminous eyes seem to shoot gleaming
fire; from his nose issues a dreadful spike. He is furnished with
sharp-pointed ears and a forked tongue, four sturdy legs terminating in
eagle's feet strongly webbed, clawing and

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

clutching at his prey. Great leathern bat-like wings armed with sharp
hook's points, complete his equipment. The wings are always "endorsed,"
that is, elevated and back to back.

The dragon of our modern books of heraldry is a miserable impostor, a
degenerate representative of those "dragons of the prime, that tore each
other in their slime." It is curious to note in this the gradual
degradation from the magnificent saurian type of the best period of
heraldic art to a form not far removed from that given to an ordinary
four-legged creature covered with plates and scales. His legs are longer
and weaker, his mighty caudal appendage, shrunk to insignificant and
useless<span id="img_09300"></span>

proportion, and most unlike his ancient prototype the crocodile. This
error of our modern heraldic artists displays remarkable lack of proper
knowledge of this mythical creature and his attributes. Such a splendid
creation of the fancy should not be represented in such a weak and
meaningless form by the hands of twentieth-century artists. The ancient
form is infinitely to be preferred as a work of symbolic art.

<span id="img_09400"></span> ![Arms of the City of
London](img/09400.jpg.md)

<span class="smallcaps">Arms of the City of London</span>.—Two dragons
are the supporters of the arms of the City of London, the crest a
dragon's sinister wing. They are thus blazoned: *Argent a cross gules,
in the first quarter, a sword in pale point upwards of the last.
Supporters, on either side a dragon with wings elevated and addorsed,
argent, and charged on the wing with a cross gules*.

The crest is *a dragon's sinister wing charged with a similar cross*.

<span class="smallcaps">The County of Chester</span> has for its
supporters two dragons, each holding an ostrich feather.

Basingstoke, Linlithgow and Dumfries on the town seals have St. Michael
overthrowing the dragon (*see* [p. 72](fsca15.htm#page_72).md).

The dragon appears in various forms in the arms of many towns, and also
in those of some peers.

One of the most extraordinary and elaborate coats of arms of modern
times is that of Viscount Gough. The sinister supporter<span

of the shield is a dragon (intended to represent the device upon a
Chinese flag). *A dragon or, gorged with a mural crown sable, inscribed
with the word "China," and chained gold*.

Examples vary considerably in the form of the dragon, some early
examples represent it to have four legs, others with only two, when it
is properly a wyvern. The pendent "George" in the Order of the Garter
represents it with a body similar to a crocodile, winged and covered
with plates and scales.

A similar device to that of the George noble of Henry VIII. was the St.
George slaying the dragon by Pistrucci, a foreigner employed at the
mint. This handsome reverse, says Mr. Noel Humphrey, "Coin Collector's
Manual," is nearly a copy from a figure in a battle-piece on an antique
gem in the Orleans collection, but several Greek coins might equally
well have furnished the model. Old George III. sovereigns and
five-shilling pieces have

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

this most finely conceived and executed device on the reverse of the
coins. It also appears upon some sovereigns of Queen Victoria.
Prominence is naturally given to the figure of St. George, the dragon in
consequence being diminished in its relative size.
