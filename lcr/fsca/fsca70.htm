<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> heraldic dolphin, as, usually represented by modern heralds, is an ornamental monstrosity bearing but slight resemblance to<A NAME="img_26700"></A>
<TABLE ALIGN="RIGHT"><TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" VALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="img/26700.jpg" ALT="Example&#8212;Dolphin embowed."></TD></TR></TABLE> the natural form of this celebrated historic marine symbol; a nearer resemblance to the natural shape is decidedly preferable. Some of the early heraldic representations, though a little crude, are very characteristic and thoroughly heraldic in treatment, though at the same time very unlike the real dolphin.</p>  
<p>In its series of leaps out of the water the dolphin appears with high arched back, just as we see it represented in antique works; its natural shape, however, is straight, the back being but slightly curved. The broad tail paddle being placed in a horizontal position necessitates an up and down stroke, which makes their swimming to appear</p>  
<p><a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="green">p. 268</font></A></p>  
<p>a series of leaps and divings. Like its near relative the porpoise, it is an air-breathing animal; its apparent gambollings on the water may, therefore, be more truly attributed to its breathing and blowing whilst in pursuit of its prey.</p>  
<p>The Dolphin is generally, if not always, depicted in heraldry <i>embowed</i>, that is, having its back greatly incurvated. In blazon the word <i>Dolphin</i>, alone, implies that its natural position, <i>naiant</i> (swimming) and embowed, is understood, but for the sake of accuracy it is better always to give the description in full, as a doubt may arise as to the omission of a word indicating its position.</p>  
<p><i>Torqued</i>, <i>torquend</i>, <i>torgant</i>, or <i>targant</i>, from the Latin <i>torquere</i>, to twist, are old terms for embowed, or bowed embowed, bent in the form of the letter S, turning contrary ways at each bending; applicable also to serpents.</p>  
<p><i>Hauriant</i>, from the Latin <i>ab hauriendo</i>, is a term applied to fishes generally when placed in an upright position or in pale, as if putting the head above water to get air.</p>

<p><a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="green">p. 269</font></A></p>  
<p>Shell-fish are blazoned <i>erect</i> or <i>upright</i>, the term hauriant being only applicable to fishes with scales and fins.</p>  
<p><i>Urinant</i> (from the Latin <i>urino</i>, to duck or dive under water) signifies borne with the head downwards and the tail erect, the reverse position of hauriant.</p>  
<p>Two dolphins are occasionally borne together, sometimes endorsed, or back to back; sometimes respecting each other.</p>  
<p>As signifying the conquest of the sea, it appears in the shields of many seaport cities. It figures on the well-known bearings of the towns of Brighton, Dunkirk, Poole, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>The Dolphin appears in English heraldry as early as the middle of the thirteenth century. In a roll of arms of that date, a dolphin is given as the coat of Gile de Fiseburn.</p>  
<p>"The Godolphins of Helston," says Miss Millington, "who had estates in that part of the kingdom (Cornwall) at the time of the Conquest, bore <i>argent three dolphins embowed, sable</i>." Similar arms are borne by many English families.</p>  
<p>The Godolphins, Franklins, Franklands, Frenches, Fishers and Kennedys, in many of their branches, bear the dolphin fish as their crest.</p>  
<p>A man playing the harp on a dolphin is the heraldic cognisance of the Walterton family.</p>
