### The Hydra

<span class="small">"*Seven great heads out of his body grew,

 His tail was stretched out in wondrous length*."

The terrible dragon, with one hundred heads, that guarded the golden
apples of the Hesperides, slain by Hercules, was celebrated in classic
mythology; so was the Lernean hydra, a monster of the marshes that
ravaged the country of Lerna in Argolis, destroying both men and beasts.
The number of its heads varies with the poets, though

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

ancient gems usually represent it with seven or nine. Hercules was sent
to kill it as one of his twelve labours. After driving the monster from
its lair with arrows he attacked it with his sword, and in place

of each head he struck off two sprang up. Setting fire to a neighbouring
wood with the firebrands he seared the throat of the Hydra until he at
length succeeded in slaying it. The fable is usually referred to in
illustration of a difficulty which goes on increasing as it is combated.

The Lernean hydra, the watchful dragon of the garden of the Hesperides,
the many-headed Naga or snake of the Hindu religion, are, say learned
writers, only some of the many forms under which the relics of the
ancient serpent-worship exhibited itself.

*A hydra, wings endorsed vert, scaled or*, is the crest of *Barret* of
Avely, Essex. It is also borne by the names *Crespine* and *Downes*.
