### The Chimera

<span class="smallcaps">An</span> imaginary fire-breathing monster of
great swiftness and strength, invented by the ancient Greek poets.
Though mentioned by heraldic authorities, it is not met with in British
coat armour; it is described as having the head, mane and legs of a<span

lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a dragon. From this creature
the term "chimerical" is applied to all such figures as have no other
existence but in the imagination. It is represented upon the coins of
Sycion during the Achæan League.

The origin of the story of the chimera is ascribed to a mountain in
Lycia which had a volcano on its top and nourished lions; the middle
part afforded pasture for goats, and the bottom was infested with
serpents; according to Hesiod it had three heads, that of a lion, a
goat, and a dragon. Bellerophon destroyed the monster by raising himself
in the air on his winged steed Pegasus, and shooting it with his arrows.

 High o’er the rest in arms the graceful Turnus rode;  
 A triple pile of plumes his crest adorned,  
 On which with belching flames chimera burned:  
 The more the kindled combat rises higher,  
 The more with fury burns the blazing fire."

Phillip II. of Spain, after his marriage with Queen Mary of England,
assumed as a device, Bellerophon fighting with the chimera, and the
motto, "Hinc vigilo," the monster being intended by him for a type of
England's heresies which he waited his time to destroy.

The family of *Fada* of Verona have for arms: Gules a winged chimera
argent, the head and breasts carnation (or proper), and the wings and
feet of an eagle. The illustration, however, has the head and breasts of
a woman, and eagle's wings and feet, and makes it a different creature
entirely, and should more properly be blazoned *harpy*.
