### Sea-lion

or *Lion poisson*, a mythical sea-creature, frequently used in heraldry
as an emblem of bold actions achieved on the ocean in the country's

*the top flames issuant proper; on the sinister side a sea-lion erect

When the sea-lion or other compounded creature of this kind is erect, it
should be clearly blazoned as "a sea-lion erect on his tail," to
distinguish it from naiant, the swimming position natural to it.
