### The Cockatrice

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> chimerical creature was said to be
produced from a cock's egg hatched by a serpent; hence its name. It
differs from the wyvern of heraldry only in having a head like that of a
dunghill cock. "This monster is of that nature," says an old writer,
"that its look or breath is said to be deadly poison"; and this, in
addition to the ordinary weapons of offence, would constitute it rather
a difficult creature to be interfered with.

The cockatrice is frequently referred to in the Scriptures as the type
of something evil. "The weaned child shall put his<span

hand on the cockatrice's den" (Isaiah xi. 8), meaning that the most
noxious animal shall not hurt the most feeble of God's creatures.

And Jeremiah viii. 17: "For behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices,
among you which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the
Lord."

The cockatrice is a frequent emblem in heraldry, borne as a charge upon
the shield and also as a supporter. To the mailed draconic form of the
wyvern it had the hideous crested head with livid dangling wattles
similar to the dunghill cock, its round glittering eyes dealing death;
its barbed tongue and serpentine tail, with deadly sting, would no doubt
render it a fearful object to behold, and terrific to its enemies. It is
always borne in profile, the wings endorsed, or back to back, unless
directed otherwise. The tail is frequently nowed, *i.e.*, knotted.

*Sable, a cockatrice or, combed and wattled gules*.—*Bothe*.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

*Sable, a cockatrice, displayed argent, crested, membered and jelloped
gules*.—*Baggine*.

*Jelloped*, *jowlopped*, terms used to describe the comb or crest, and
gills or wattles, when of a different tincture from the body. *Beaked*
and *membered*, in similar manner, have reference to the beak and legs.
