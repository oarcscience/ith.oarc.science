### Griffin or Gryphon

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> griffin, gryfin, or gryphon, as it is
variously termed by old writers, is best known as one of the chimerical
monsters of heraldry—the mediæval representative of the ancient symbolic
creature of Assyria and the East. It may be classed with the dragon,
wyvern, phœnix, sphynx, "gorgons and

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

hydras and chimeras dire," and other imaginary beings, that world of
unreality grown up in the mind of man from the earliest times, the
influence of whose terrors have exercised no little power in the
progress of humanity.

<span id="img_14800"></span> ![A Griffin statant, wings

This favourite bearing was very early adopted in English armory. So
early indeed as 1167 A.D. we find it on a seal of Richard de Redvers,
Earl of Exeter, attached to a charter at Newport, Isle of Wight. It also
appears on a seal of Simon de Montacute (*temp*. Henry III. and Edward
I.). It is one of the principal bearings in heraldry, either charged
upon the shield, as the arms, or as the crest placed upon the helm, also
as supporters to the shield

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

of arms of many noble and eminent families in this country and the
continent.

The *griffin*, "sacred to the sun," combines the bodily attributes of
the "cloud-cleaving eagle" and the "king of beasts," that is, it has the
head, neck, wings, and talons of an eagle, conjoined to the hinder parts
of a lion. It is usually represented with projecting

<span id="img_14900"></span> ![\[left\]A Griffin passant, wings raised.
(Early English.) \[right\] A Griffin segreant, wings displayed.
(German.)](img/14900.jpg.md)

ears, indicating an acute sense of hearing, in addition to its other
supposed extraordinary qualities.

The griffin is rarely borne in other than two positions, viz., *passant*
and *segreant*. The latter term is peculiar to the griffin, and seems to
refer to the expanded wings. When called *segreant* only, it means the
same as rampant applied to a lion. As a crest, it is not unfrequently
borne *sejant*, *i.e.*, sitting. Parts of the creature, as a
*demi-griffin*, *a griffin's head*, &c., are also of common use.

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

The arms of *Trafford*, Lancashire, are: *Argent a griffin segreant
gules*. Motto: *Gripe griffin hold fast*. The supporters of the arms of
Viscount Halifax are two griffins.

Old heralds gravely relate of this creature that when he attains his
full growth he will never be

<span id="img_15000"></span> ![Sleeping Griffin, by John Tenniel, from
Alice in Wonderland.](img/15000.jpg.md)

taken, hence he is a fit emblem of a valiant hero, who, rather than
yield himself to his enemy, exposes himself to the worst of dangers. As
a general symbol in heraldry the griffin expresses strength and
vigilance.

Sir Thomas Browne says it is emblematical of watchfulness, courage,
perseverance and rapidity of execution.

The description of the griffin by the old traveller,

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sir John
Mandeville, is a wonderful record of credulity and belief in the
marvellous; he states it to be a native of "Bacharie, where ben many
griffones, more plentee than in any other countree. Sum men seyn that
they have the body upwards of an egle and benethe as a lyonn, and truly
they seyne soethe that thei ben of that schapp. But one griffoun hath
the body more great and stronger than one hundred egles, such as we have
amonges us. For one griffoun there will be flynge to his nest a great
hors, or two oxen yoked togidre, as thei gon to the plowghe. For he hath
his talouns so longe and so grete and large upon his feet as though thei
were hornes of grete oxen, or of bugles (bulls), or of kygn, so that men
maken cuppes of hem to drynke of, and of hire (their) ribbes and of the
pennes of hire wenges men maken bowes fulle stronge to schote with
arrews and quarell." Gerard Leigh, an old heraldic writer, discoursing
of the griffin, gives his reason for belief, he says, "I thinke they are
of a great hugeness, for I have a *clawe* of one of their pawes, whiche
should shewe them to be as bigge as two lyons."

In the cathedral of Brunswick there is still preserved the horn of some
kind of antelope, brought from the Holy Land as "a griffin's claw," by
Henry the Lion. Three talons of the griffin were preserved at Bayeux,
and fastened on high festival days to the altar, and there seems to be
some curious legend concerning a cup formed of a gryphon's claw
dedicated to St. Cuthbert. A gryphon's egg was also considered

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

a valuable curiosity, being used as a goblet in old times when natural
history was greatly misunderstood and grossly exaggerated. As an example
of the absurd misstatements of the earlier writers and naturalists who
so delighted our wonder-loving forefathers, a writer in the "Museum of
Animated

<span id="img_15200"></span> ![Griffin segreant, German
version.](img/15200.jpg.md)

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nature" refers to
a large species of vulture, the Condor (*Sarcoramphus Gryphus*), which
was painted as rivalling the Rukh of Oriental fable. He adds that "such
descriptions have given place to the moderate details of sober-minded
observers, and we no longer look upon this creature as the winged
guardian of mountain mines within whose depths were entombed 'gems and
barbaric gold,' we no longer imagine it the giant of the winged race,

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

dimming the light of the sun by its widespread pinions, and by the
mighty rushing sound as it sweeps down from some lofty pinnacle or the
upper regions of the sky deafening and stupefying the terror-stricken
beholders."

As the stern avenger of human crimes, the dreaded Nemesis appears in
Roman Art, as a young woman with wings, in a chariot drawn by griffins,
with a whip or sword in her hand. <span id="fr_11"></span>[\*](#fn_11.md)

Smith's "Classical Dictionary" gives the following: "Gryps or gryphus, a
fabulous monster dwelling in the Rhiphæan mountains between the
Hyperboreans and the one-eyed Arimaspians, and guarding the treasures of
the north. The Arimaspians mounted on horseback attempted to steal the
gold, and hence arose the hostility between the horse and the griffin.
The body of the griffin was that of a lion, while the head, fore-feet
and wings were those of an eagle. It is probable that the origin of the
belief in griffins must be looked for in the East, where it seems they
have been very ancient. They are also mentioned among the fabulous
beasts which guarded the gold of India."

The Arimaspians were a one-eyed people of Scythia who adorned their hair
with gold. They were constantly at war with the Gryphons who guarded the
gold mines.

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As when a gryphon, through the wilderness . . .  
 Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stealth  
 Had from his wakeful custody purloined  
 The guarded gold."  
                                         *Paradise Lost*, ii.</span>

</div>

That the form of the griffin must have been a well understood symbol is
evident from the frequency with which it is met in ancient art. Dr.
Schliemann, in his explorations of the ancient city of Mycenæ,

<span id="img_15400"></span> ![Gold Flying Griffin, found by Dr.
Schliemann at Mycenæ.](img/15400.jpg.md)

among other treasures found a gold-winged griffin, about two inches in
length, in one of the sepulchres of the kings (Figure No. 272 in his
book), which in every particular as to shape is identical with the
heraldic griffin of to-day; the same may be said of a coin of Abdera, a
city in Thrace, which bears the device of a griffin. Abdera was a place
of importance when Xerxes invaded Greece B.C. 554.

Herodotus relates that the Teians, dreading the encroachments of the
Persians in Ionia, abandoned their city and founded Abdera in Thrace.
The coinage of the latter place bears the same type (the griffin)as the

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

parent city, but with a slight difference in treatment. This consists in
the form of the wings of the griffin, which are pointed on the coins of
Abdera, while in those of Teos they are rounded. The griffin was sacred
to Apollo, to whom an especial worship was

<span id="img_15500"></span> ![Colossal Griffins,
Burmah.](img/15500.jpg.md)

devoted in most of the Ionian cities, but more particularly in
Teos. <span id="fr_12"></span>[\*](#fn_12.md)

In the *Illustrated London News* of October 21, 1876, is an engraving of
two gigantic wingless griffons, and also a description by the traveller
who visited that strange place. "At Thyetmo, 250 miles up the river
Irrawaddy from Rangoon in British Burmah, are two colossal 'chin thay'
or figures of

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

sacred griffins, standing at the entrance to one of the great pagodas
dedicated to the worship of Gautama Buddha; the outer terraces and steps
of these temples are frequently adorned with such mythical monsters.
Near the ancient ruined city of Paghan, which flourished a thousand
years ago, the bank of the river for a length of eight miles is lined
with the remains of this quaint architecture and sculpture, covering a
space of two miles in breadth from the water's edge. It is not known by
what nation of old times they were constructed, for Burmese history is
apocryphal or at least very obscure."

The symbolic use of images of living creatures was in the instance of
the cherubim permitted under the Mosaic dispensation, and on this will
be found to turn the distinction between the symbolic use and its
forbidden and dangerous use as a supposed means of assisting devotion.
Mr. Henry Hayman in Smith's Dictionary," *s.v.*, "cherub," as quoted by
Tyrwhit, says: On the whole it seems likely that the word 'cherub' meant
not only the composite creature-form of which the man, lion, ox, and
eagle were the elements, but further, some peculiar and mystical form
which Ezekiel, being a priest, would know and recognise as 'the face of
a cherub,' κατ᾽ εξοχήν, but which was kept secret from all others. . . .
Such were probably those on the ark, which when moved was always
covered, though those on the hangings and panels might be of the popular
device. The

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

griffin of northern fable, watching the gold in the wilderness, has been
compared with the cherub both as regards his composite form and his
functions as guardian of a treasure. He goes on to point out the
possible affinity between the Greek root γρυπ, (γρυψ, gryps, griffin),
and the Hebrew and Arabic derivation of the word 'cherub,' which gives
it the original meaning of 'carved image,' and says that though the
exact form is uncertain, it must have borne a general resemblance to the
composite religious figures found upon the monuments of Egypt, Assyria,
Babylonia and Persia."

Mr. Ruskin, <span id="fr_13"></span>[\*](#fn_13.md) describing the
emblematical griffins on the front of the Duomo of Verona, points out
that the Lombard carver was enabled to form so intense a conception,
mainly by the fact that his griffin is a great and profoundly felt
symbolism. Two wheels are under its eagle's wings, which connect it with
the living creatures of the vision of Ezekiel, "where they went the
wheels went by them, and whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went,
and the wheels were lifted up over against them, for the spirit of the
living creatures was in the wheels." The winged shape thus became at
once one of the acknowledged symbols of the divine nature. Elsewhere, we
think in the "Stones of Venice," the connection is pointed out between
the Assyrian and Gothic personations.

Gian-Paolo Baglione (+ 1520), who usurped the

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

sovereignty of Perugia, bore a *silver griffin* on a red field with the
motto, "*Unguibus et rostro atque alis armatus in hostem*" ("Armed
against the enemy with talons and beak and wings"), which means of
defence proved of no avail when he was seized by Pope Leo X., who,
pretending to consult Baglione on affairs of importance, sent him a safe
conduct to Rome, but when he arrived, he caused him to be tortured and
beheaded, and afterwards took possession of his states. This gave
occasion to his enemies to say, "This ugly bird has not used his wings
as at other times, to flee from the snare which has been laid for
him." <span id="fr_14"></span>[\*](#fn_14.md)

In Dante's description of the triumph of the Church, in the Purgatorio,"
we have the mediæval conception of this wondrous creature, the gryphon.
"The mystic shape that joins two natures in one form"—as he is called by
the noble Italian poet—draws the car to which he is harnessed, and

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                               "He above  
Stretched either wing uplifted ’tween the midst  
    .          .          .          .          .  
And out of sight they rode. The members, far  
As he was bird, were golden; white the rest,  
With vermeil interveined."</span>

</div>

And when the eyes of Beatrice

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                "stood Still,  
fix’d toward the gryphon, motionless.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"> As the sun strikes a mirror, even thus  
 Within those orbs the twyfold being shone;  
 For ever varying, in one figure now  
 Reflected, now in other. Reader! muse  
 How wondrous in my sight it seem’d, to mark  
 A thing, albeit steadfast in itself,  
 Yet in its imaged semblance mutable."  
                     Cary's Dante, *Purgatory*, c. xxix.</span>

</div>

"Some commentators of Dante," says M. Dideron, <span
id="fr_15"></span>[\*](#fn_15.md) "have supposed the griffin to be the
emblem of Christ, who, in fact, is one single person with two natures;
of Christ in whom God and man are combined. But in this," says M.
Dideron, "they are mistaken. There is, in the first place, a manifest
impropriety in describing the car as drawn by God as a beast of burden."
"Commentators," it is added, "have been misled by the two-fold nature of
the gryphon, but that difficulty is removed by recollecting that the
Pope resembles the eagle in his spiritual character, and in his temporal
authority the lion. The Pope is one person, but of two natures and two
distinct forms. Thus considered the allegory of Dante becomes clear and
intelligible."

The gryphon is very frequently seen sculptured in Gothic churches, more
especially in those of the Lombard and early Norman style, and is
evidently intended to refer to the union of the divine and human
natures.

A curious example of this compound form of bird

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

and beast occurs on an Italian bronze medal of the fifteenth century,
about 3½ in. in diameter (No. 57.51 in the fine collection in South
Kensington Museum). On one side it bears a portrait of Niccolo Picininus
of

<span id="img_16000"></span> ![Carved panel, a Griffin
segreant.](img/16000.jpg.md)

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Perugia, a
celebrated mercenary soldier—and on the reverse a griffin, the eagle's
head, wings, and feet united to the Roman she-wolf, with Romulus and
Remus suckling. Dante's emblem of the Popedom is here apparently adapted
to the peculiarly Roman national symbol—the nursing mother of nations
and the Catholic religion.
