THE dragon is the most interesting and most frequently seen of all
chimerical figures, and it is a remarkable fact that such a creature
appears at an early period of the world's history to have been known in
the East and in countries widely separated. Long anterior to the dawn of
civilisation in the West of Europe, even in far-off China and Japan in
the extreme East of Asia we find the dragon delineated in very much the
same form in which it appears in our national heraldry.

The ancients conceived it as the embodiment of

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

malignant and destructive power, and with attributes of the most
terrible kind. Classic story makes us acquainted with many dreadful
monsters of the dragon kind, to which reference will afterwards be more
particularly made.

It is often argued that the monsters of tradition are but the
personification of solar influences, storms, the desert wind, the great
deeps, rivers inundating their banks, or other violent phenomena of
nature, and so, no doubt, they are, and have been; but the strange fact
remains that the same draconic form with slight modifications constantly
appears as the type of the thing most dreaded, and instead of melting
into an abstraction and dying out of view, it has remained from age to
age, in form, distinctly a ferocious flying reptile, until in the
opinion of many the tradition has been justified by prosaic science. It
is surprising to find that the popular conception of the dragon—founded
on tradition, passed on through hundreds of generations—not only retains
its identity, but bears a startling resemblance to the original
antediluvian saurians, whose fossil remains now come to light through
geological research, almost proving the marvellous power of tradition
and the veracity of those who passed it on.

Mr. Moncure Conway ("Demonology, or Devil Lore") says: "The opinion has
steadily gained that the conventional dragon is the traditional form of
some huge saurian. It has been suggested that some of those extinct
saurians may have been contemporaneous

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

with the earliest men, and that traditions of conflicts with them,
transmitted orally and pictorially, have resulted in preserving their
forms in fable proximately."

"Among the geological specimens in the British Museum," says Hugh
Miller, "the visitor sees shapes that more than rival in strangeness the
great dragons and griffins of mediæval legends; enormous jaws, bristling
with pointed teeth, gape horrid, in stone, under staring eye-sockets a
foot in diameter; and necks that half equal in length the entire body of
a boa-constrictor. And here we see a winged dragon that, armed with
sharp teeth and strong claws, has careered through the air on leathern
wings like those of a bat." We are also told in the sacred Scriptures by
Moses of "fiery serpents," and by Isaiah of "a fiery flying serpent."
Other monsters—dragons, cockatrices, and some of whose form we have no
conception—are also mentioned. Euripides describes a dragon or snake
breathing forth fire and slaughter, and rowing its way with its wings.
It is evident that such a creature may at one time have existed. Looking
at the widespread belief in dragons, there seems little doubt that the
semi-myth of to-day is the traditional successor of a really
once-existent animal, whose huge size, snake-like appearance, and
possibly dangerous powers of offence made him so terrible that the
earlier races of mankind adopted him unanimously as the most fearful
embodiment of animal ferocity to be found.

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

One of the latest acquisitions in the Natural History Museum, South
Kensington, is the skeleton of that enormous creature the long-limbed
dinosaur (*Diplodicus Carnegii*), recently discovered in America,
eighty-nine feet in length from the head to the tip of the tail, the
huge bulky framework of the monster measuring eleven feet in height at
the shoulder. The enormous length of its neck and tail, with relatively
small head, would indicate it to be an amphibious inhabitant of the
waters, feeding on the vegetation growing in its depths.

Mr. Moncure Conway, in his remarkable work, "Demonology, or Devil Lore,"
describes all intermediate stages between demon and devil under the head
of dragon. This he believes to be the only fabulous form which
accurately describes all the transitions. Throughout all the
representations of the dragon one feature is common, and that is the
idealised serpent. The dragon possesses all the properties of the demon
along with that of harmfulness, but differs from the devil in not having
the desire of doing evil. The dragon in mythology is the combination of
every bad feature in nature, all of which is combined into one horrible
whole. "The modern conventional dragon," says Mr. Conway, "is a terrible
monster. His body is partially green, with memories of the sea and of
slime, and partly brown or dark, with lingering shadows of storm-clouds.
The lightning flames still in his red eyes, and flashes from his
fire-breathing mouth.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The thunderbolt of
Jove, the spear of Woden, are in the barbed point of his tail. His huge
wings—bat-like and spiked—sum up all the mysteries of extinct harpies
and vampires. Spine of crocodile is on his neck, tail of the serpent and
all the jagged ridges of rocks and sharp thorns of jungles bristle round
him, while the ice of glaciers and brassy glitter of sunstrokes are in
his scales. He is ideal of all that is hard, destructive, perilous,
loathsome, horrible in nature; every detail of him has been seen through
and vanquished by man, here or there; but in selection and combination
they rise again as principles, and conspire to form one great
generalisation of the forms of pain, the sum of every creature's worst."

"<span class="smallcaps">The External Forms of Dragons</span> are
greatly dependent on the nature of the country in which they originate.
In the far north, where exist the legends of the swan and pigeon,
maidens and vampires, exists the swan-shaped dragon. As demons of
excessive heat principally existed in the south, so in the north the
great enemy of man was excessive cold. In the northern countries is
found also the serpent element, but as serpents are there frequently
harmless, this feature does not enter much into their composition. The
<span class="smallcaps">Cuttlefish</span> is supposed to have helped in
the formation of the <span class="smallcaps">Hydra</span>, which in its
turn assisted in forming the dragon of the Apocalypse. Assyrian ideas
also seem to have assisted in the pictorial impersonations of the hydra.
This

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

many-headed monster is a representation of a torrent, which being cut
off in one direction breaks out in another. The conflicts of Hercules
with the hydra are repeated in those of the Assyrian Bel with Trinant
(the deep), and also in the contentions of St. Michael with the dragon.
The old dragon myths left in Europe were frequently utilised by the
Christians. Other saints besides St. Michael were invested with the
feats of Hercules; St. Margaret, St. Andrew, and many others are
pictured as trampling dragons under their feet. The Egyptian dragon is
based on the crocodile, and this form being received into Christian
symbolism did greatly away with other pagan monsters. The hideousness of
the crocodile and the alligator could easily be exaggerated so as to
suit the most horrible contortions of the human imagination. Amongst the
most terrible dragons is Typhon, the impersonation of all the terrors of
nature. Son of Tartarus, father of the harpies and of the winds, he
lives in the African deserts; from thence fled in fear, to escape his
terrible breath, all the gods and goddesses. He is coiled in the
whirlwind, and his many heads are symbolical of the tempest, the scrive,
the hurricane, and the tornado."

Under the head of <span class="smallcaps">The Colonial Dragon</span> Mr.
Conway has embodied all the horrors and difficulties with which the
early colonists would be beset. Amongst these he places the <span
class="smallcaps">Gorgon</span> and the <span
class="smallcaps">Chimera</span>. The most widely spread of all is the
last named, and from it is supposed that all Christian and British
dragons

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

are descended. The Christian myth of <span class="smallcaps">St. George
and the Dragon</span> is but a variation of <span
class="smallcaps">Bellerophon and the Chimera</span>, in which the last
has given place to the dragon and the pagan hero to St. George.

"In ancient families there are usually traditions of some far-distant
ancestor having slain a desperate monster. It is always the colonial
dragon that has

<span id="img_06500"></span> ![Japanese Dragon.](img/06500.jpg.md)

been borrowed by poets and romancers. <span class="smallcaps">The
Dragon</span> killed by Guy of Warwick is but another variation of the
chimera. There is again the <span class="smallcaps">Sockburn
Worm</span>, slain by Sir John Conyers for the devouring of the people
of the neighbourhood; the well-known tradition of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lambton Worm</span> is in reality a modification of
the <span class="smallcaps">Aryan Dragon of the Storm Cloud</span>;
smaller than a man's hand he swells out to prodigious dimensions."

A favourite subject for Chinese and Japanese painting and sculpture is a
dragon very much of the

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

same type, and a monstrous representation of a dragon in the form of a
huge Saurian still forms the central object at Japanese festivals.

Among the Chinese the dragon is the representation of sovereignty, and
is the imperial emblem borne upon banners, and otherwise displayed as
the national ensign. To the people of that vast country it represents
everything powerful and imposing; and it plays an important part in many
religious ceremonies and observances. Dr. S. Wells Williams, the eminent
sinalogue, describes the fabulous monster of Chinese imagination in the
following passage: There are three dragons—the *lung* in the sky, the
*li* in the sea, and the *kiau* in the marshes. The first is the only
*authentic* species according to the Chinese; it has the head of a
camel, the horns of a deer, eyes of a rabbit, ears of a cow, neck of a
snake, belly of a frog, scales of a carp, claws of a hawk, and palm of a
tiger. On each side of the mouth are whiskers, and its beard contains a
bright pearl; the breath is sometimes changed into water and sometimes
into fire, and its voice is like the jingling of copper pans. The dragon
of the sea occasionally ascends to heaven in waterspouts, and is the
ruler of all oceanic phenomena." The fishermen and sailors before
venturing away from land or returning to port, burn joss-sticks and beat
gongs to ward off the evil influences of the dragon, and it is
worshipped in a variety of ways. According to a fable current in China,
the Celestial Emperor Hoang-ti was carried up to heaven, along

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

with seventy other persons, by a great dragon; those who were only able
to catch at his moustaches were shaken off and thrown on the ground. It
is still the custom when an emperor dies to say that the dragon has
ascended to heaven. An eclipse the simple

<span id="img_06700"></span> ![JAPANESE IMPERIAL DEVICE. The Dragon, the
Ho-Ho, or Phœnix, and the Chrysanthemum.](img/06700.jpg.md)

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Celestials believe
to be caused by a great dragon that seeks to devour the sun or moon. A
great noise is made by firing guns, beating drums, and the rattling and
jangling of pairs of discordant instruments to frighten the monster
away. A frequent subject of their artists is the dreadful dragon
sprawling through masses of curling clouds in the act of grasping at or
swallowing the great luminary, a subject which no doubt bears a deeper
meaning than we see, and one intimately connected with their mythology.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

In some of their splendid festivals the worship of the dragon is
celebrated with great excitement and furore. On the Canton river a boat
of immense length formed like a dragon in many wondrous folds, rowed by
fifty or more natives, with wild music and dancing, and accompanied by a
crowd of junks; the unfurling of sails and the streaming of flags from
the masts, the beating of drums, the noise and smoke from the firing of
guns, all exhibit the fondness of a people for the pleasures of a
national holiday.

*Dragon's Teeth*.—Cadmus slew the dragon that guarded the well of Ares,
and sowed some of the teeth, from which sprang up the armed men who all
killed each other except five, who were the ancestors of the Thebans.
Those teeth which Cadmus did not sow, came to the possession of Ætes,
King of Colchis; and one of the tasks he enjoined on Jason was to sow
these teeth and slay the armed warriors that rose therefrom. The
frequent allusion to the classic term *dragon's teeth* refers to
subjects of civil strife; whatever rouses citizens to rise in arms.

The mythical dragon has left the lasting impress of his name in various
ways in our language and literature, as in the art of nearly every
country.

☊ *Dragon's Head* and ☋ *Dragon's Tail*.—In astronomy *Nodes* are the
opposite points in which the orbit of a planet, or of a moon, crosses
the ecliptic. The ascending node marked by the character (☊),

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

termed the *Dragon's head*, is where the planet or moon ascends from the
south to the north side of the ecliptic, and the descending node
indicated by the character (☋) the *Dragon's tail* is where it passes
from the north to the south side.

*Draco*, a constellation in the northern hemisphere, representing the
monster that watched the golden apples in the garden of the Hesperides,
slain by Hercules, and set as a constellation in the heavens.

*Draco volens*, a meteor sometimes visible in marshy countries—*Ignus
fatuus*, or will-o’-the-wisp.

*Draco volens*, or flying dragon, a curious class of saurian reptiles
peculiar to the East Indies, having membranous attachments to their
limbs, which give them the appearance of flying as they leap from tree
to tree.

*Dragon's blood*, a vegetable balsam of a dark red colour brought from
India, Africa, and South America. So called from its resemblance to
dried and hardened masses of blood.
