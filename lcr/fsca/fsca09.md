### Mistaken Modern Conception of Angels

<span class="smallcaps">Many</span> poets and artists of modern times
appear to have lost sight of the traditions of sacred art, and in their
endeavours to spiritualise the character of angelic beings have in this
respect been led to portray them as altogether feminine in form and
appearance. This error should be carefully avoided, because in a
spiritual as well as in a human sense the vigorous active principle they
represent, besides having the warrant of Scripture, is more fitly
represented by man than by woman.

Mahomet, who borrowed his ideas mostly from the Christians, in this
instance, possibly to guard his followers from some latent form of
idolatry, said of angels with some show of reason, that "they were too
pure in nature to admit of sex," but to meet the ideas of his followers
he invented another race of celestial beings for the delight and solace
of the faithful in the paradise to which he lured them.

*Ministering Spirits or Guardian Angels*.—These form a frequent theme of
poets and artists. The idea was apparently evolved from the mention of
"ministering spirits" before the throne of God in holy writ, and from
the ecclesiastical legends and traditions of the Christian mythology of
early date, derived from still earlier sources. Thus Milton speaks of—

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                    "one of the Seven  
 Who in God's presence, nearest to the throne  
 Stand ready at command, and are his eyes  
 That run thro’ all the heavens, and down to earth  
 Bear his swift errands."  
                                     *Paradise Lost*, iii.</span>

</div>

According to ancient Jewish belief, each person had his or her guardian
angel, and a spirit could assume the aspect of some visible being:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But she constantly affirmed that it was even so.  
 Then said they, 'It is his angel.'"  
                                  *Acts* xii. 15.</span>

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Brutus as you know was Cæsar's *Angel:*  
 Judge, O ye God, how dearly Cæsar loved him."  
        <span class="smallcaps">Shakespeare</span>, *Julius Cæsar*, Act
iii. sc. 2.</span>

</div>

Spenser finely expresses the idea of the good and evil influences
continually warring unseen about us, and his gratitude for the effective
protection of the guardian spirits:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"How oft do they their silver bowers leave,  
 To come to succour us that succour want!  
 How oft do they with golden pinions cleave  
 The flitting skies, like flying pursuivant,  
 Against fowle fiends to ayde us militant  
 They for us fight, they watch, and dewly ward,  
 And their bright squadrons round about us plant;  
 And all for love, and nothing for reward:  
 O why should heavenly God to men have such regard?</span>

</div>

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

Milton beautifully assumes the pure nature of saintly chastity attended
by ministering spirits:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A thousand liveried angels lackey her,  
 Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt,  
 And in clear dream and solemn vision,  
 Tell her of things that no gross ear can hear;  
 Till oft converse with heavenly habitants  
 Begins to cast a beam on the outward shape."  
                                           "Comus."</span>

</div>

And Scott, in figurative language, apostrophising woman in her higher
and more spiritual sphere, says in "Marmion":

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When pain and anguish wring the brow,  
 A ministering angel thou!"</span>

</div>

Shakespeare expresses a prevailing idea that the pure in heart will
become ministering angels in heaven; Laertes, at the grave of Ophelia,
fiercely thunders forth:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I tell thee, churlish priest,  
 A ministering angel shall my sister be  
 When thou liest howling."</span>

</div>
