<span class="smallcaps">A curious</span> creature of the imagination is
the lamia, of which we are told many fictitious stories. It is said<span

to be "the swiftest of all four-footed creatures, that it is very
treacherous and cruel to men. It is stated to be bred in Lybia, and
sometimes devours its own young." It is represented in an ancient
"Bestiaria" as having the head and breasts of a woman, and the body of a
four-footed animal with flowing tail, the hind feet having divided
hoofs. It is "thought to be the creature mentioned in Isaiah xxxiv.,
called in Hebrew *Lilith*, as also the same which is mentioned in
Lamentations iv."

In Dr. Brewer's "Dictionary of Phrase and Fable," <span
class="smallcaps">Lamia</span> is "a female phantom whose name was used
by the Greeks and Romans as a bugbear to children, from the classic
fable of a Lybian Queen beloved by Jupiter, but robbed of her children
by Juno; and in consequence she vowed vengeance against all children,
whom she delighted to entice and murder." They are again described as
spectres of Africa, who attracted strangers and then devoured them. In
the story of "Machatës and Philemon," a young man is represented

as marrying an Empusa, who sucks his blood at night. Goethe borrowed his
ballad of the "Bride of Corinth" from this tale.

Beyond casual mention this mythical creature does not appear in
heraldry.
