### The Liver (Cormorant)

<span class="smallcaps">Liver</span>, a fabulous bird, supposed to have
given its name to Liverpool and commemorated in the arms of that city.
It is traditionally described as a bird that frequented *the pool*, near
which the town was afterwards founded. The arms granted in 1797 are thus
blazoned: *Argent a cormorant, in the beak a branch of seaweed all
proper, and for crest, on a wreath of the colours, a cormorant, the
wings elevated, in the beak a branch of Laver proper*. It is more than
probable that the bird on the arms suggested the name "Liver" being
applied to it. The fiction naturally arose from the desire to find a
derivation for the name of the town. It is, however, always depicted as
a cormorant. On the shield the bird is always depicted with the wings
*close*, and on the crest the wings are *elevated*.
