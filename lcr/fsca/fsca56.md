resembles *a goat, with the head and horns of a ram*, but has besides
the horns of that beast, *a pair of goat's horns*. It is also mentioned
in Guillim's "Display," where it is said to be a bigenerous beast, of
unkindly procreation, engendered between a goat and a ram, like the
Tityrus, the offspring of a sheep and goat, as noted by Upton.
