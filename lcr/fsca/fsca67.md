### The Sirens of Classical Mythology

<span class="smallcaps">The Sirens</span> (Greek, entanglers) enticed
seamen by the sweetness of their song to such a degree that the
listeners forgot everything and died of hunger. Their names were,
Parthenope, Ligea, and Leucosia.

Parthenope, the ancient name of Neapolis (Naples)

<span id="img_24900"></span> ![Ulysses and the Sirens. Flaxman's
Odyssey.](img/24900.jpg.md)

was derived from one of the sirens, whose tomb was shown in Strabo's
time. Poetic legend states that she threw herself into the sea out of
love for Ulysses, and was cast up on the Bay of Naples.

The celebrated Parthenon at Athens, the beautiful temple of Pallas
Athenæ, so richly adorned with sculptures, likewise derives its name
from this source.

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

Dante interviews the siren in "Purgatorio," xix. 7–33.

Flaxman, in his designs illustrating the "Odyssey," represents the
sirens as beautiful young women seated on the strand and singing.

In the illustration from an ancient Greek vase

<span id="img_25000"></span> ![Ulysses and the Sirens. From a painting
on a Greek vase.](img/25000.jpg.md)

gives a Grecian rendering of the story, and represents the Sirens as
birds with heads of maidens.

The Sirens are best known from the story that Odysseus succeeded in
passing them with his companions without being seduced by their song. He
had the prudence to stop the ears of his companions with wax and to have
himself bound to the mast. Only two are mentioned in Homer, but three or
four are mentioned in later times and introduced into various legends.
Demeter (Ceres)

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

is said to have changed their bodies into those of birds, because they
refused to go to the help of their companion, Persephone, when she was
carried off by Pluto. "They are represented in Greek art like the
harpies, as young women with the wings and feet of birds. Sometimes they
appear altogether like birds, only with human faces; at other times with
the bodies of women, in which case they generally hold instruments of
music in their hands. As their songs are death to those subdued by them
they are often depicted on tombs as spirits of death."

By the fables of the Sirens is represented the ensnaring nature of vain
and deceitful pleasures, which sing and soothe to sleep, and never fail
to destroy those who succumb to their beguiling influence.

Spenser, in the "Faerie Queen," describes a place "where many mermaids
haunt, making false melodies," by which the knight Guyon makes a
somewhat "perilous passage." There were five sisters that had been fair
ladies, till too confident in their skill in music they had ventured to
contend with the Muses, when they were transformed in their lower
extremities to fish:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But the upper half their hue retained still,  
 And their sweet skill in wonted melody;  
 Which ever after they abused to ill  
 To allure weak travellers, whom gotten they did kill."  
                                    Book ii. cant. cxii.</span>

</div>

Shakespeare charmingly pictures Oberon in the moonlight, fascinated by
the graceful form and the

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

melodious strains of the mermaid half reclining on the back of the
dolphin:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"  <span class="smallcaps">Oberon</span>: . . . Thou
rememberest  
 Since once I sat upon a promontory,  
 And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back  
 Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath  
 That the rude sea grew civil at her song  
 And certain stars shot madly from their spheres  
  To hear the sea-maid's music."</span>

</div>

Commentators of Shakespeare find in this passage (and subsequent parts)
certain references to Mary Queen of Scots, which they consider beyond
dispute. She was frequently referred to in the poetry of the time under
this title. She was married to the Dauphin (or Dolphin) of France. The
rude sea means the Scotch rebels, and the shooting stars referred to
were the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, who, with others of
lesser note, forgot their allegiance to Elizabeth out of love to Mary.

"Few eyes," says Sir Thomas Browne, "have escaped the picture of a
mermaid with a woman's head above and a fish's extremity below." In
those old days when reading and writing were rare accomplishments,
pictured signboards served to give "a local habitation and a name" to
hostelries and other places of business and resort. Among the most
celebrated of the old London taverns bearing this sign, <span
id="fr_30"></span>[\*](#fn_30.md) that in Bread Street stands foremost.

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

We find this "Mermayde" mentioned as early as 1464. In 1603 Sir Walter
Raleigh established a literary club in this house, and here Shakespeare,
Ben Jonson, and the choice intellectual spirits of the time used to
meet, and there took place those wit combats which Beaumont has
commemorated and Fuller described. It is frequently alluded to by
Beaumont and Fletcher in their comedies, but best known is that
quotation from a letter of Beaumont to Ben Jonson:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">            "What things have we seen  
 Done at the Mermaid? heard words that have been  
 So nimble and so full of subtle flame,  
 As if that any one from whence they came  
 Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest,  
 And had resolved to live a fool the rest  
 Of his dull life; then when there had been thrown  
 Wit able enough to justify the town  
 For three days past; wit that might warrant be  
 For the whole city to talk foolishly,  
 Till that were cancell’d; and when that was gone,  
 We left an air behind us, which alone  
 Was able to make the next two companies  
 (Right witty, though but downright fools) more wise."</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_30"></span>[252:\*](fsca67.htm#fr_30.md) The sign was also
used by printers: John Rastall, brother-in-law to Sir Thomas More,
"emprynted in the <span id="page_253">p. 253</span> Cheapesyde at the
Sygne of the Mermayde; next to Powlsgate in 1572." Henry Binnemann, the
Queen's printer, dedicated a work to Sir Thomas Gresham, in 1576, at the
sign of the Mermaid, Knightrider Street. A representation of the
creature was generally prefixed to his books.—"History of Sign-boards,"
p. 227.
