### Merman or Triton

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Triton, who boasts his high Neptunian race  
 Sprung from the God by Solace's embrace."  
                                <span class="smallcaps">Camoëns</span>,
"Lusiad."

"Triton his trumpet shrill before them blew  
 For goodly triumph and great jolliment  
 That made the rocks to roar as they were rent."  
                       <span class="smallcaps">Spenser</span>, "Faerie
Queen."  
                      (Procession of the Sea Deities.)

<span class="smallcaps">Triton</span> was the only son of Neptune and
Amphitrite. The poet Apollonius Rhodius describes him as having the
upper parts of the body of a man, while the lower parts were those of a
dolphin.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Later poets and
artists revelled in the conception of a whole race of similar tritons,
who were regarded<span id="img_24000"></span>

as a wanton, mischievous tribe, like the satyrs on land. Glaucus,
another of the inferior deities, is represented as a triton, rough and
shaggy in appearance, his body covered with mussels and seaweed; his
hair and beard show that luxuriance which characterises sea-gods.
Proteus, as shepherd of the seas,<span id="img_24001"></span>

is usually distinguished with a crook. Triton, as herald of Neptune, is
represented always holding, or blowing, his wreathed horn or conch
shell. His mythical duties as attendant on the supreme sea-divinity

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

would, as an emblem in heraldry, imply a similar duty or office in the
bearer to a great naval hero.

<span class="smallcaps">Examples</span>.—The City of Liverpool has for
sinister supporter a *Triton blowing a conch shell and holding a flag in
his right hand*.

<span id="img_24100"></span> ![Mermaid and Triton
supporters.](img/24100.jpg.md)

Lord Lyttelton bears for supporters *two Mermen proper, in their
exterior hands a trident or*.

Ottway, Bart.—Supporters on either side, *a Triton blowing his shell
proper, navally crowned or, across the shoulder a wreath of red coral,
and holding in the exterior hand a trident, point downward*.

*Note*.—In classic story, Triton and the Siren are distinct poetic
creations, their vocation and attributes

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

being altogether at variance—no relationship whatever existing between
them. According to modern popular notions, however, the siren or
mermaid, and triton, or merman as they sometimes term him, appear to be
viewed as male and female of the same creature (in heraldic parlance
baron and femme). They thus appear in companionship as supporters to the
arms of Viscount Hood, and similarly in other achievements.
