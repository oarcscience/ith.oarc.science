### The Royal Tiger

<span class="smallcaps">Next</span> to the lion in power is the tiger,
an animal not possessed of the noble qualities of the lion, being fierce
without provocation, and cruel without cause. The chief difference of
the tiger from every other animal of the mottled kind is in the shape of
the spots on the skin, which run in streaks or bands in the direction of
the ribs. The leopard, panther and the ounce are all, in a certain
degree, marked like this animal, except that the lines are broken by
round

spots, which cover the whole surface of the skin. The use of the *royal
tiger* in modern coats of arms is frequent, and has reference to
services in the East.

Outram, Bart., has for supporters: *two royal Bengal tigers guardant
proper, gorged with a wreath of laurel vert, crowned with an Eastern
crown*.

Note.—In a heraldic description (or blazon as it is termed) it is
necessary for the sake of greater clearness, and to prevent confusion,
to name the older mythical creature the "<span
class="smallcaps">Heraldic Tigre</span>," that it may not be confounded
with its natural representative usually called the "<span
class="smallcaps">Royal Tiger</span>"
