### 5. Footprints on the Sands of …

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Some things people accept; some they reject. Others, they will accept as
long as they have a ready-made answer, but—certain things they simply
don't know what to do about.

</div>

If you look out of your window one morning to find that it has snowed
during the night, you may be happy or you may be sad. If then, while
contemplating this quite natural phenomenon, you perceive upon its
pristine surface a number of marks of regular shape, forming a set of
tracks, the sundry relays, feedbacks, and synapses in your brain may
snap open or shut in ordered patterns, causing you to register almost
subconsciously such concrete items as man, dog, car, snowplow, or
suchlike. You may even go so far as actually to think, saying to
yourself "That's funny, Mary went out already." Foot-tracks are
commonplace, and quite logical, and we consider them as objects. Yet
they are not even quasi-objects; they are entirely negative physically;
are purely subjective concepts; and in almost all cases are ephemeral
things. Nevertheless, they are quite acceptable, provided we have a
ready-made answer for them, ranging from vague terms such as "dog," all
the way to "Mary wearing a particular pair of shoes." When, however, a
set of foot-tracks turns up on snow, or any other surface for that
matter, to which people cannot immediately put a label, they become
quite hysterical, and in their frantic efforts to explain this appalling
thing, they will indulge in the most terrifyingly illogical actions.
They also say the silliest things.

Simple logic demands that a foot or any other print must have been made
by something, and something which must

**MAP III. NORTH AMERICA**

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

This continent should be regarded as reaching from the Arctic Ice-Raft
to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. It is divided into three parts: first,
into a western and an eastern, by the Great Barrier, the dividing line
running roughly down the 110th Meridian. Secondly, the eastern half is
sub-divided latitudinally about the 45th parallel; to the north being
closed forest and tundra; to the south, open forest (parklands) and
prairies. The midwest, southwest, and Mexico are arid and covered with
scrub and desert. The rest is mountainous, and forested almost
exclusively with conifers. In the Mexican Sierras there are some
tropical forests. Along the eastern fringe of the continent lie the
Appalachians, and there is another upland area in Labrador. The valley
of the Mississippi and its tributaries form extensive, swampy
bottomlands.

</div>

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

have been at the point where the imprint was made. But sometimes,
unfortunately for humanity, matters don't always work out that way, in
either one or both of these respects. The second class of problems is
the less awful. For instance, "How on earth did Mary get up on the barn
roof?" may jolt you but can have all sorts of logical explanations. If
one is sufficiently concerned about Mary's welfare, it is the common
practice to investigate these in order of likelihood, starting by asking
Mary, if she is around; and ending by calling in the long-suffering
police if she has disappeared. Even in this class, however, there can be
nasty ones. We once found a set of what looked like our tame porcupine's
tracks, inside an empty cage, which was constructed of heavy wire in the
form of a cube on all six sides, and had a firmly locked door. That took
some investigation and it reduced a number of normally sane citizens to
gibbering idiots in the meantime.

(Said porcupine had once been housed in that cage for an hour or so,
while its own cage was cleaned and repaired, by an assistant who was not
present when the bizarre discovery was made. The earth floor inside the
cage had been wet at the time and the animal had left deep tracks in the
claylike mud. This dried solid. The assistant had then, in accord with
his routine duties, put a 2-inch covering of fresh earth over this. The
night before the uproar there had been about 15

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

minutes of torrential rain, which had washed all this top layer exactly
off the old hardened one and the tracks had appeared looking just as if
they were fresh and, of course, once again in damp earth.)

The more abominable class is that of individual prints or sets of
tracks—and the two items are quite different and should be at all times
most carefully defined by the use of the appropriate term—for which
there is not a ready-made explanation. A *print* (or imprint) is an
individual item such as that of one foot. A set of *tracks* (or a track)
is, on the other hand, a series of prints, either interrupted as in
animals, or continuous as made by wheeled machines, left by some moving
object. There are quite a lot of reports of single prints being found
both in such positions as may be explained—as in a small patch of mud on
a rocky path—but on occasion in places that cannot be explained. These
last are, of course, very unnerving.

*Sasquatch* imprints and tracks, along with those of their relatives or
congeners, by whatever name they were known, were perfectly all right by
the Amerinds because they had just such a ready-made answer, all of
them, as they readily tell one, knowing perfectly well that they were
made by the big, wild, hairy men of the woods: or by their wives and
children. As the Amerinds gave up being Americans and started to become,
or were forced to become sort of bogus Europeans, they forgot to tell
their own children about these personages. The result was that in time
we even have Amerinds becoming for a time slightly disturbed. \[Amerinds
*never* under any conditions become "hysterical."\] When, however, white
men first saw these large ABSM tracks they invariably went into a fairly
advanced trauma. This habit was apparently universal among Europeans and
people of European origin, right up until the time when a ready-made
answer became disseminated—namely, *Sasquatches*, *Oh-Mahs*,
etc.—whereupon a happy reaction set in. This was simply to say: "Oh,
those! Don't worry, they're made by runaway Indians; they have huge
feet, you know, and sometimes grow hair to keep out the cold."
(Amerinds, I should point out here, are either

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

wholly or substantially of Mongoloid ancestry, the group of the human
race that is defined as being the most glabrous \[almost without body
hair\], and having particularly small, neat feet.

It is rather interesting to note in passing that persons of African
ancestry have behaved quite otherwise throughout. They possess ancestors
who have always recognized a nonmaterial world just as widespread and as
real as the material one. This is probably why they are such great
pragmatists. What is more, according to them, entities in both worlds
customarily muck about in the other, so that men's souls can range
around "elsewhere" and *chumbis*—or what we in our innocence call
ghosts, poltergeists, and spirits—can, in their estimation, quite well
leave imprints and foot-tracks. Africans of the Negroid branch of
humanity and their descendants are, therefore, the greatest skeptics
throughout our story, they have never really been interested in or even
much surprised about the matter, for they have a sort of built-in
answer; and while they have always thought Europeans to be stupid for
not carrying on with disembodied entities, they usually think the
Amerinds quite batty for needing an embodied entity to explain these
tracks. The few people of African origin whom I have met in the course
of this business in North America, as well as in Africa appear,
furthermore, to have accepted the physical appearance of ABSMs that they
themselves have witnessed, with the utmost equanimity and simply as
lucky or dangerous happenstances.

I bring all this up now because it has to be aired in any case sooner or
later, and because from now on we are going to have all three major
branches of the human race involved in the matter. Their reactions are
indeed different, whatever anybody may say about generalizations. All
three "races" are present in the United States, where our story now
takes us, and since we are going to follow the foot-tracks of the ABSMs,
clear through this country to tropical America, we are going to have to
be prepared for some real surprises—both ways. You will see what I mean
by this in a minute.

At this point I would ask you to glance at [Maps III](#img_map03.md) and
[XVI](abs22.htm#img_map16.md),

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

before proceeding, because, without some idea of the facts of
vegetational distribution, very little of what I have to say in this and
the next chapter will make much sense. I know by experience that it is
quite all right for me or anybody else to say almost anything about
foreign lands, and the farther away and thus foreign they are, the more
outrageous the claims may be. This is the reason why such a high
percentage of "explorers" are found, on proper investigation (if that is
possible, which it seldom is), to be phonies, even if only mildly and
innocuously so. When, on the other hand, anybody makes even slightly
unusual remarks about the country *in* which he is speaking and to
citizens *of* that country, he is almost certain to be disbelieved,
probably ridiculed, and oftimes harassed for his pains. This applies to
statements as innocent as "You know, the hillbillies down there don't
wear shoes." Try it sometime, *down there*, but don't wait to see what
happens, for you'll have the local State Department on your back if you
have published your statement, and you'll find yourself excluded from
private swimming pools if you have merely said it in family circles.

Since I have a private swimming (duck) pond of my own, and seldom wear
shoes indoors in winter or either in- or out-of-doors throughout the
whole summer and early fall as well as, for other reasons that I will
not go into, I have made a profession of saying things about the country
I am in. I am, in fact and as I said at the outset, a reporter and as I
don't give a damn whether anybody wears shoes or not, nor what their
opinions are on that or any other subject, and am interested only in
facts, I am constantly saying things that annoy people. What I have to
say now is going to annoy some types very much. Moreover, if you haven't
as yet glanced at these maps, you may be so annoyed that you will just
stop reading. I don't want you to do this, but for purely altruistic
reasons—namely that these facts are such fun. To keep you reading,
therefore, let me just tell you that, if you do so, you are going to get
a really good laugh, specifically at the expense of just those people
whom you have always thought were idiots in

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

any case. \[Admittedly, this includes almost everybody other than
yourself, which makes it all the more pleasant.\]

Animals (and ABSMs) take no account of political boundaries even when
they are physically erected by people in the form of barbed-wire fences
or iron curtains. They do, on the other hand, not only take into account
but conform absolutely to certain boundaries and dividing lines set up
by Nature. No animal ever, it seems, transgresses such a boundary and
these boundaries may often be so precise that you can stand with one
foot in one great natural province and the other foot in another. There
are animals that range over more than one and sometimes over half a
dozen provinces. These are called *catholic* species; but most animals
stay within the confines of just one province. Within the provinces,
moreover, there are a number of natural niches or environments. Nature
abhors a vacuum (as we have been repeatedly told) and she fills all her
niches with an appropriate animal species. If any one dies out or is
exterminated, some other animal will come in to inhabit its niche. As an
example, the South American aquatic porcupine called the Coypu
(*Myopotamus coypu*) the fur of which is called *nutria*, was introduced
into North America 50 years ago and immediately started to fill up the
niche previously occupied by the Beaver which had, at that time, been
largely exterminated in this country by fur trappers.

Sometimes a species of animal will introduce itself into an area and do
battle with the established occupants of the particular niche that it
likes. Then again, men have introduced animals from one country to
another and started virtual animal wars, usually with fatal consequences
to one or the other party. In Australia introduced European animals,
like the dog, cat, fox, and rabbit, have committed mass mayhem on the
indigenous fauna: on the other hand, attempts to introduce the pheasant
in certain parts of North America have repeatedly failed. The whys and
the wherefores of these results have proved very puzzling in that there
seemed to be no rhyme or reason for them. There is, nonetheless, a law
governing the matter, and a very precise one. This is a botanical
matter.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

The whole earth is portioned out into different types of plant
growth—different in the way the vegetation grows (in height, density,
and so forth) rather than in what particular types of plants it
contains—and these form great belts around the earth regardless of
oceans, seas, and mountains. These belts, which meander about and
broaden out or wither down sometimes almost to nothing, are also
subdivided into blocks or provinces going from east to west, like the
cross-stripes on a banded snake. Each one of these provinces has its own
history, climate, weather, soils, flora, and fauna. What is more, it has
now been discovered that all faunas are wholly dependent upon vegetation
but not so much upon the constitution of that vegetation as upon the way
in which it grows. Human beings are animals and they conform to these
general principles too, even down to national types. So it seems, do
ABSMs. (For fuller details of all this, see Chapter 18.)

Man, however, is what is called an adaptable animal. He is also
incredibly tough, and can survive in more types of vegetation and in a
wider variety of environments than most animals, being surpassed in this
ability by only a few other animals, such as the spiders and their
allies, which live in water and in air, and range from icecaps to still
hot lava flows, and to the tops of mountains where even plants give up.
Nevertheless, when man comes to settle down and try to earn a living and
breed, even he conforms to the old pattern. Hollanders gyrate to coastal
flats, and Norwegians to warm, wet fiords. However, man *can* survive an
ousting from his natural environment and he has often done so. The
Neanderthalers appear to have been driven back into the hills by the
folk of Cromagnon-culture; and the Jews were blasted all over the lot,
and have survived.

ABSMs, it seems, have also been driven back into certain environments.
By the time my story is told, you will see why I say this and why it
happened. There is nothing mysterious about it. It is simply that ABSMs
are Hominids or, just as every benighted native has always asserted,
*human* rather than animal, and thus are endowed in one degree or
another

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

with human attributes, and most notably their powers of survival, their
adaptability, their toughness, and their acuteness. The Pongids, or
apes, on the other hand, though looking so like humans, are the lousiest
adapters, are completely stuck with their special environments and in
their particular provinces. They can hardly breed outside them, even
with the very best and most modern human medical assistance—as witness
the tiny number of gorillas born in captivity. In other words, about 50
million years ago, Nature started an experiment with a couple of Primate
types now called the Hominid and the Pongid. The first made the grade,
and mostly through the efforts and discoveries of ABSMs; the latter
failed, and are doomed.

If there are ABSMs in North America, as well as Central and South
America (as would appear from what follows), and they are Hominids, they
must have come here from somewhere else, for we can say with almost
absolute certainty that neither Man nor the Hominids was evolved in the
New World. What is more, not so much as a single bone or other
indication has ever been discovered suggesting that either the Pongids
or any of the true Monkeys ever even got here. On the other hand, men
got here, and at a rather early date. Bones of the animals he brought
back from hunting forays have been dated certainly back to before the
last ice-advance; some are claimed to be more than 40,000 years old. We
have not yet obtained the bones of the earliest of these men themselves,
but, if some anthropologists are right, there are some extremely old and
quite primitive stone implements at the lowest levels, and we now know
that a creature (such as East Africa's *Zinjanthropus*) was a toolmaker
but most certainly would be called an ABSM if he were found running
around today. Failure to find the bones of ABSMs is no cause for stating
that they never existed. Tools of the types known as Chellean and
Acheulian have been known from all over southern Europe and Africa since
men started collecting such items, but it was not until the last decade
that we found a single bone of the men who made them—if we have yet done
so, as a matter of fact.

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

However, ABSMs seem once to have roamed much of North America. Why,
then, should those alleged still to do so, although really very hominoid
in form, appear to be without tools, fire, or speech? We have to look at
it this way. They were probably here in the purely "animal" stage of
their development, and they kept coming in waves \[over the Bering
Straits, if you like\] at ever increasingly efficient levels of
toolmaking and development, until they were replaced by their cousins
who were so "*something-or-other*" that we, upon digging up their
remains, call them Men. \[Lots of these came too, making ever better
tools, until the misguided Amerinds made the mistake of tagging along.
At this point we enter history and the domain of other specialities.\]
As brighter and better ABSMs turned up, however, the previous occupants
had to move out into less desirable environments—nasty places like
deserts and mountains—and by the time proper Men arrived, these places
were getting quite crowded. At that point another factor became
operative.

ABSMs, both here and all over the world, had been getting "better"—which
is another way of saying more complicated or mixed up—and, thus, in
certain ways less efficient again. The more complex their culture
became—and don't think that they didn't have a culture for
Nutcracker-Man (*Zinjanthropus*) of 600,000 years ago in East Africa
made splendid tools but had a brain somewhat more paltry than the
average chimp—the more dependent they were upon an easy environment,
which means one where it was easy to obtain a living. Chased out into a
rough one by still more cultured chaps, they began to find the going
very hard. In fact, the more "cultured" they were, the worse they fared
when pushed up into the mountains; and the more advanced they were, the
more easily and rapidly they gave up and became extinct. Thus, we have
the extraordinary spectacle of the more primitive surviving and the more
advanced wilting away. Today, only the most primitive have apparently
survived, and in the remotest and ruggedest places where any other ABSM
less rugged could not get along; where Man, however tough,

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

failed; and where even Modern Man, who has really got somewhere with his
culture, finds it hard going. And just where is this?

The answer is very simple and absolutely definitive. It is what is
called by botanists *The Montane Forests*. This is why I suggested that
you take a look at the maps and see where such forests are, especially
today, on our continent. From these you will note that their
distribution coincides exactly with that of the reports of our ABSMs; as
it does on all the other continents with *their* ABSMs. There is only
one exception, from the botanical point of view, and this I would like
to dispose of forthwith.

The last retreat on land of anything is a forest. In North America
between those latitudes occupied by the United States, most lowland
forests are woodlands, and anything unwanted in them has long ago been
eliminated. \[One can't speak of feral dogs because we introduced
them.\] In Canada, of course, such forests are still virtually
impenetrable. There remain then the montane forests \[which are not
quite the same thing as mere forests on mountains\] and one other type
of vegetational growth. This is what are called technically the
Bottomlands. By this is meant swamps at low level but mostly in river
valleys and deltas, that are covered with a closed-canopy forest of some
kind however short in stature, and which are either flooded all the
time, seasonally, or from time to time, so that they are unpleasant for
man to live in and a lost cause to try and clear, drain, and farm. It so
happens that we have a very great acreage of just such country in the
United States that is tacitly ignored by everybody and frankly unknown
to most. This is concentrated along the Mississippi Valley and up the
valleys of the tributaries of that great river.

The best road maps of the states that straddle these Bottom-lands look
perfectly OK at first sight, being covered with roads of various grades,
having names of counties, townships, and so forth scattered all over
them and seeming, when viewed individually, to be quite consistent with
all other road maps

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

of our country. If, however, you look more carefully at them, take a
pair of dividers, consult the scale at the foot of the map, and then
select your areas carefully you can isolate almost endless parts of the
map that look like this:

<span id="img_09200"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![1050 square miles
in Northern Louisiana](tn/09200.jpg)

1050 square miles in Northern Louisiana  
</span>

This you will not, of course, believe. It will also probably make you
very annoyed. You might therefore assuage your fury by going out and
buying or writing to one of the oil companies to obtain maps of such
states as Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiana, and spend a moment or two with a rectangle
of the dimensions and the scale of the above. It will probably make you
even more angry, but I said that I would name names, even if I am "down
there."

The reason I bring this obnoxious subject up at this time is that,
before we can get back to the main road of our travelogue, there is
something that is really unpleasant that

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

has to be taken care of. This is the "Little Red Men of the Trees." How
aggravating can I get; and how far out on what limb can I wriggle? You
would be surprised indeed; but I warn you in the most friendly fashion,
please don't forget that I am a reporter and, as of now, nothing else.
It is therefore my duty to report to you; so here goes:

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

Dear Sir,

My name is James Meacham, I read the article that you wrote for True
Magazine. <span id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_10.md) I have been planning on
going to California in the same area that your article was about. I was
a little surprised to read about such a creature as an abominable
Snowman living so close to where I intended to visit. I have always
liked to explore places that other people care little about. I would
like to know all you can tell me about this creature if you can tell
anything more than you did in the article. I am sure a man of your
standing must have more information about this subject than was in those
few pages. I will gladly pay the postage on the information you can
send. I cannot offer more because I am not working at the present.

I have met a few strange things in my life; as I am still young, there
are many more I will probably see. I would like to know if you can tell
me anything about a creature that looks like a small ape or a large
monkey that has hair the color of fur a reddish orange color. I saw such
a creature when I was 15. A friend was with me but did not see it.
Whatever it was did not have a tail like a monkey but it did swing like
one by its arms. This may sound like something that I thought I saw but
really didn't which I would believe except for a few details.

I had a .22 calibre semi-automatic with me. I watched this thing for
about 5 minutes so I have to believe it. I put fourteen .22 long-rifle
shells into whatever it was. From where I was standing I couldn't have
missed. We found 1 bullet in the tree trunk so 13 of them hit it. The
part that sounds more impossible is that whatever it was, did not even
move while 13 bullets went into it. If I had missed all 14 bullets would
have gone into the tree trunk.

I have told many people about this but nobody believes it. We found a
few hairs where I had shot, but nothing else except the bullet. There
was not a trace of blood. My partner thinks it was a squirrel but no
squirrel grows that big. If it had been one, 2 of those bullets would
have stopped it dead. Whatever it was did not even move till I headed
for the

</div>

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

tree. It traveled through those trees like an express train. I could
hear the leaves rattle but could not see it.

I searched for it for a long time after that but never saw it again. No
one in that area knows anything about it or has ever seen it. It had a
cry that was enough to drive a person crazy. That was almost 3 years ago
\[19571 and I still wake up in my sleep sometimes when that sound comes
back to me. If you can give me any advice as to what it could have been
I will greatly appreciate it. If I had not shot it myself I would not
believe it, not being able to find any blood. I know you must receive a
lot of letters about this sort of thing, but all I want to know is what
animal in a marsh near Jackson, Tenn. could hold 13 long-rifle shells
without even moving till you start to come after it? That is what
started me looking for things most people think cannot possibly exist.

Yours truly,

James M. Meacham.

</div>

In 1954 a young Orang-utan escaped from a shipment of apes to a
well-known Florida organization, took off into the woods, and has never
been seen again. I refrain from giving further details because the
valuable ape was paid for, but reported as DOA, a trade term for "dead
on arrival," and someone still might get in trouble. The incident is
fairly widely known in certain circles, and has been a perfect nuisance
because when anything like the above is reported, even as far away as
Tennessee, it is immediately dredged up by way of explanation. I suppose
it is just possible that a healthy young *Mia* \[a better name for what
we call the Orang-utan\] could survive a succession of mild Southern
winters and it could travel an enormous distance by trees alone, but
what it would eat during most of the year I don't know. Much more
important is that a lost ape that has once been in captivity for even a
short period would be almost certain to head for the nearest human
habitation the moment it got hungry or saw anything novel that
frightened it. In all the years that I had a zoo, I never knew an
escaped animal \[apart from local fauna, and even many of those\] *not*
to return voluntarily to its own cage during the night. Of course this
"ape" might have escaped from some zoo much nearer the place where this
correspondent said he saw it, but the loss of a $5000 specimen

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

from a zoo would not go unnoticed; though, it must be admitted, it might
well go unreported—to the Directors, that is. There is as much
hanky-panky in the animal business as in any other. An escaped Mia is,
however, I rather think, itself merely an escape mechanism as it is
called, especially when we come to contemplate the following.

From *Hoosier Folklore*, Vol. 5, p. 19, March, 1946:

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

Another type of story that is of much more concern to us here in
Southern Illinois nowadays is the "strange beast" legend.… Every few
years some community reports the presence of a mysterious beast over in
the local creek bottom.

Although it is difficult to determine just where a story of this sort
has its beginning, this one seems to have originated in the Gum Creek
bottom near Mt. Vernon. During the summer of 1941, a preacher was
hunting squirrels in the woods along the creek when a large animal that
looked something like a baboon jumped out of a tree near him. The
preacher struck at the beast with his gun barrel when it walked toward
him in an upright position. He finally frightened it away by firing a
couple of shots into the air.

Later the beast began to alarm rural people by uttering terrorizing
screams mostly at night in the wooded bottom lands along the creeks.
School children in the rural districts sometimes heard it, too, and
hunters saw its tracks.… By early spring of 1942, the animal had local
people aroused to a fighting pitch. About that time, a farmer near
Bonnie reported that the beast had killed his dog. A call went out for
volunteers to join a mass hunt to round up the animal.

The beast must have got news of the big hunt, for reports started coming
in of its appearance in other creek bottoms, some as much as 40 or 50
miles from the original site. A man driving near the Big Muddy River, in
Jackson County, one night saw the beast bound across the road. Some
hunters saw evidence of its presence away over in Okaw. Its rapid
changing from place to place must have been aided considerably by its
ability to jump, for, by this time, reports had it jumping along at from
20 to 40 feet per leap.

It is impossible to say how many hunters and parties of hunters, armed
with everything from shotguns to ropes and nets, went out to look for
the strange beast in the various creek bottoms where it had been seen,
or its tracks had been seen, or its piercing screams had been heard.
Those taking nets and ropes were intent on bringing the creature back
alive.

found, and interest in it dies as mysteriously as it arose in the
beginning.… About 25 years ago, a 'coon hunter from Hecker one night
heard a strange beast screaming up ahead on Prairie du Long Creek.
Hunters chased this phantom from time to time all one winter. Their dogs
would get the trail, then lose it, and they would hear it screaming down
the creek in the opposite direction. It was that kind of creature: you'd
hear it up creek, but when you set out in that direction you'd hear it a
mile down creek.

And again:

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

Dear Mr. Sanderson,

I listened to you on Long John Nebel's program last Thursday and was
very much surprised that you talked about such things as Abominable
Snowmen in America. I am a housewife but I majored in biology, attended
our state university and have an M.A. in plain zoology. My husband is an
experimental chemist employed by … \[company name withheld for obvious
reasons: Author.\] and my eldest son is a technician in the Air Force. I
come from Mississippi but we have resided here (in Kentucky) for ten
years now.

I wonder if you have ever heard of the Little Red Men of the Delta?
Nobody thought anything much of them where I was raised except that one
had better be careful of shooting one because it might be murder, or so
the sheriff might think if anything came of it, but I was surprised to
find that the folks hereabout know it too though they took some years to
talk about it to me. My husband is a New Englander and these folks don't
talk much. They are \[the Little Red Men of the Delta\] said to be about
the size of a ten year old kid and able to climb like monkeys and to
live back from the bayous. They talk a lot but keep out of gunshot range
and mostly go into the water. They are people and the muskrat trappers
say they often wear scraps of discarded lines \[linens?\] old jeans and
such.

If you have heard about them will you talk about them on the air as it
puzzles me that nobody has ever talked about them but everybody in some
places seems to know about them. There was sure nothing in my biology
course about them but there's a lot folks don't know or don't talk about
…

Yours, etc.,  
Mrs. V. K.

</div>

And you can say that again! Plain ordinary citizens just don't talk;
they are born with too much sense. Ridicule is the

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

most dastardly thing and can ruin one's whole life in one small jump. It
takes real guts to come right out and say you've seen the Loch Ness
Monster; and you'd better have private means, if you do. Otherwise,
humanity at large will round on one and jump in unison, and they have a
collective memory that can last for a century. Don't do it, brethren and
sistren! \[That's why I always ask specifically whether I may publish a
name.\]

I could go on quoting tidbits like the above for quite a long time and
give transcripts of some tape recordings that I have but what, frankly,
is the use? No one will believe either the stories or me. Nonetheless, I
would be failing in my duty—which, incidentally, I take very seriously;
and please make no mistake about that—if I did not put this outrageous
matter before the public. Like many other things "reported" it needs,
and can stand, a good airing. I am not saying that there is even so much
as a word of truth in any of it but there it is, and it is no good just
ignoring it. If people "down there" will persist in penning such tripe,
we had better get on with the job of showing it up for what it really
is. But just what is it? You tell me: I am merely reporting, and I have
not yet had the time, money, nor opportunity to go to those particular
places to investigate the matter. Since others apparently have not
either, perhaps it would be better that everyone shut up. Meanwhile,
however, I refuse to just discount everything anybody from the states
listed above says. That would be tantamount to calling them all liars
and idiots; and I know for a fact that they are usually neither. What is
more, that is their country, and I am prepared to accept the fact that
they know more about it than all of us, however whacky what they say may
sound. And then there is the matter of the road maps. Just what is
anyone prepared to swear under oath he knows about the Bottomlands? I
have been a little way into some for brief periods and I must say that I
am not prepared to give out much about them at all—they are far too
vast, complex, and incomprehensible to any "foreigner." The geodeticists
have surveyed them; let them tell us. Their maps are excellent—they are
made from points 60 miles apart and from the air. They show everything!

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

As a sort of parting shot, I quote a newspaper clipping of recent date:

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

MONSTER AROUND

**Reform, Ala.**—A mysterious creature is still roaming the woods around
nearby Clanton. It eats peaches, makes sounds like an elephant, and
leaves footprints like an ape.

</div>

This whole bit is really becoming very difficult because little squibs
like this should not include so many splendid possibilities. Of course
it would eat peaches, who wouldn't? And I must admit that a herd of
elephants in a forest can sound exactly like a troop of chimpanzees
having a ball. But who in Reform, Alabama \[I like that name\] is that
good on the ichnology of the *Anthropoidea*? There is a sort of chatty
approach about this story, giving the impression that among the citizens
of Reform and Clanton there is a considerable understanding about this
beast, and there is definite indication that its presence is not a new
event. In fact then, are the Bottomlands full of runaway apes or do we
have an indigenous and most particular abomination thereabouts? I could
give an opinion but I shall refrain, for it would be even more
loathsome.

Now, and with a certain sense of relief I may say, we can get back on
the straight and narrow path, and pick up our foot-tracks again. These
we first stumbled upon in southern British Columbia at the end of the
*Sasquatch* trail. Thence, they went south over the border and,
willy-nilly we have had to follow. This is going to get us into a most
unpleasant labyrinth. It is, actually, a maze with several alternate
correct routes, all of which cross each other and land us up in
seemingly impossible predicaments. I follow the foot-tracks first.

In progressing in space we have first to retrace our tracks in time to
even earlier than before—to the "49ers," in fact. It was about that date
(1849) that Anglo-Saxon type Americans first descended upon the West in
any substantial masses. It was, of course, the gold that did it.
Actually, this area was the first to be penetrated and colonized by
Europeans on this continent; the Spaniards having made some really
astonishing

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

advances north through it from Mexico. Few people realize that these
intrepid savages in their clanking armor carrying little more than their
lovely and holy crosses, actually got into what is now Canada through
the mountainous third of our country. This area is still giving our
bulldozer operators trouble in crossing from east to west. But, here
again, is another story. The point is that the Spaniards later, and very
sensibly, contracted into the more fertile and pleasant areas and just
left the rest to the benighted Amerinds.

During this long period of some 300 years no less, things went along
much as they had done since the last ice-advance in this area—outside
the Spanish Missions. There were, however, some most agile-minded
priests who interested themselves enormously in the land and took the
Amerinds quite seriously. They left records of some of the legends of
their flocks that make most interesting reading. I have to mention the
fact of the existence of these now because they constitute the earliest
sight of our trail, leading, as always, from the Northlands on toward
the salubrious climes of tropical America. They \[the records\] speak of
great wild men of the dry upland arroyos and massed pinon forests, that
tramped lugubriously about at night scaring adolescent Amerinds and
leaving monstrous footprints on the sands of that time all over the
region. But, after these ecclesiastical indiscretions, there is a
complete blank as far as I know until the 1849 Gold Rush. Then things
began to happen in typically Yankee fashion.

This particular facet or phase of ABSMery has, like the overall picture,
to be tackled in retrospect and in the order of its rediscovery. The
alleged incidents in some cases occurred over a century ago but the
records came to light only in the last few years. They had been lying
buried in newspaper morgues. What actually happened—and this is quite
apart from the reports on individual incidents—is that a whole mass of
Easterners, unacquainted with the Far West, suddenly appeared on the
scene and went barging off into the outlands looking for gold. Prior to
their arrival there had been plenty of people along the coast and idly
dotted about the inner belt of the West, but they had stayed literally
around the water holes in

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

the latter, while they had not gone back inland from the coast in the
more northern and better watered areas—that is from the north end of the
Sacramento Valley to Puget Sound. It was when the Easterners tried to
penetrate these lands of mighty forests and seemingly everlasting
mountain ranges, one behind the other, that things began to happen.
Sometimes, they got a bit out of hand.

We are now back in the montane forests of which we have spoken so
firmly, and we are going to stay in them for a very long time. Before we
go any farther into them, though, I should state a few basic facts. Such
types of forest—and there are actually about a couple of dozen of them
between Alaska and Tierra del Fuego—are well-nigh impenetrable. That is
why not only just substantial parts, but the greater part of them, even
in our own country, are not yet "opened up." This is a loose term; so,
to be more precise, let me give one example of the state of current
affairs in what is just about the *most* accessible of all of them
today. This is the 17,000 square-mile block of territory centered around
the Klamath River area in northern California.

The extent, position, and boundaries of this area may be seen on Map IV.
You may calculate its dimensions for yourself. This I beg of you to do,
rather than writing to me about it.  <span
id="fr_12"></span>[\*](#fn_12.md) Please note also that it starts at the
bottom about Clear Lake which is just 70 miles north of San Francisco,
and it continues on north into Oregon. Actually it is confluent with a
much vaster block in the Cascades, and is nowhere completely cut off (by
farmland or nonforested land) from other lesser blocks in Oregon and
thence on to Washington. I should explain that in delineating these
wilderness blocks I do not consider a road, even a main blacktop, to be
a boundary for it does not deter any living thing that I know of from
passing from one side to the other, provided there is cover on both

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

sides right up to its edges. This great area has been surveyed and there
are maps of it down to very large scale in conformity with the best
series published by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, National Forests, and
other official agencies. There are neat county maps covered with names
and a grid on a scale of 4/10 of an inch to the mile, that look
perfectly splendid at first sight. However, I ran into a Federal agency
surveying party when I was deep in the middle of this block in 1959, and
spent several evenings with the Chief Surveying Officer who told me
things and demonstrated certain facts that, metaphorically speaking,
caused myself and my two traveling partners to lose our eyebrows—upward.

It transpired that this area has only once been "surveyed" and that was
by unofficial surveyors under contract to the U.S. Government, *in the
year 1859!* Further, the survey was ostensibly made on a 1-mile grid;
that is to say the surveyor was supposed to walk a mile north, south,
east, or west, take a fix and drive a stake, and continue doing this
till he reached some previously selected line at the other end that
linked up with the next survey. The original notebooks carried by these
surveyors of 1859, and in which they recorded the facts and figures of
their surveys in the field, a page to a mile, are on file in the Lands
Office in San Francisco. They are a revelation. The surveyor whom we met
told us that in one notebook he had found no less than 23 pages
absolutely blank and without so much as a thumbmark on them, and he told
us that all the books covering this area were like that. He stressed
that this is no deprecation of the early surveyors as, he said, they
actually did a remarkable job on the whole, managing to join up the
surveys to the 60-mile triangulation made from mountaintops (and now
corrected from aerial photography), but he pointed out that the greater
part of the resultant maps are pure conjecture and most of them made by
what surveyors call "camp-surveying." What, of course, happened was that
the country was so rugged and impassable that the surveyors just went in
as far as they could, then came back out, went around to the next
possible entrance, and tried again. When they had enough fixes around
the edges, they just ruled lines

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

connecting what they had, adjusted a bit for error, and then ruled in
the rest of the grid. And this, combined with names given to visible
mountains, ranges, Amerindian settlements in accessible valleys, and
logging operations, filled the whole thing out nicely, so that on paper
it looks almost like the outskirts of San Francisco.

Actually, this great block of territory is quite unknown. Nobody goes
into it much except a short way from its edges, and practically nobody
has gone through it. I interviewed one experienced locally bred woodsman
who took a 3-week summer vacation to attempt this. He did cut across the
southwest corner of the square but was a week late getting back to work.
A friend of mine working in there at the time of writing did come upon a
lone and unknown prospector of the old school some distance in, and he
had a *mule* in there. One "scientist" from a "university" in California
wrote a furious letter after I had published my report on the ABSMery of
this area, stating that he had "collected animals all over every bit of
the area during several seasons" and adding gratuitously that "its
entire fauna has for decades been well known." This is a point at which
I find it very hard to remain civil.

The whole of this country is clothed in a particular kind of montane,
closed-canopy, mixed deciduous-coniferous forest, of magnificent
proportions and containing some of the finest timber in the world. It
grows in three tiers with an undergrowth. The tallest trees such as
Sitka Spruce, and Douglas Fir, run up to 150 to 200 feet and stand
pretty close together. Under them on the upper reaches there is a
closed-canopy of smaller conifers, in the valleys of deciduous trees
such as maples, madroñes, etc., and beneath both of these there is
usually another closed-canopy of large saplings and smaller trees of
mixed constitution. Beneath this again is another layer that is almost
impenetrable, being composed of bushes and the dead branches of the
spruces and firs which are as strong as spring steel even when leafless,
and which persist right down to the ground like a barbed-wire
entanglement. It took me half an hour with a sharp machete to get far
enough from the one road in the country not to be able to talk to my
companions

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

left on that road. I am a fair bushwacker, having been at it all my
life, and I am pencil-thin and thus highly suitable for going through
and under things.

But this is not by any means all. The whole of this country is
constructed like a freshly plowed field on a monstrous scale. While its
mountains and peaks are not high by Western standards they are immensely
steep, and closely packed so that there is practically no horizontal
ground throughout the whole country. The whole thing is a nightmare even
to experienced woodsmen, and something much worse to road builders.

This is the real state of affairs throughout a huge block of territory
within a hundred miles of one of our greatest cities, although almost
everybody in that city would deny it positively, and even the majority
of citizens of Eureka, a large and prosperous community right on its
edge, have no idea of its true nature. Conditions are even more
difficult in other montane areas but from now on I shall simply be
saying of them, as we approach them, that they are either better or
worse than the Klamath. This is going to relieve me of the necessity for
a lot of verbiage. Readers may also find this useful in arguments; while
it will give some sort of key to assess other forests in other lands.
Actually, though, this Klamath forest is just about as difficult as I
have ever run into, and that goes for the tropics too, but it, of
course, pales before the British Columbian vegetation on the grounds of
topography for, whereas we have here to deal only with little mountains,
there we have enormous ones.

It was such topography, moreover, that was tackled by the greenhorns
from the East looking for gold. They didn't get very far, but they did,
according to the older Amerinds still living, and who got it from their
fathers and grandfathers, cause the ABSMs to make a sudden mass
withdrawal into the inner recesses of each of the blocks, at that time.
This interesting information was first given to me by a Mr. Oscar Mack,
doyen of the Yurok clans of the upper Hoopa Valley. The same statement
has cropped up again and again during my investigations all over the
Puget Sound to California area. If, moreover, you look at [Map
I](abs06.htm#img_map01.md) you will note an extremely odd

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

fact. This is that early reports (and of various types) came also from
what is now Idaho in what is called more technically the North Montane
Province. Some very funny things happened there in early days and they
seem still to be happening. Most of them center round the real
wilderness area about the upper Salmon River which flows into the Snake
River as shown on that map. It was in Idaho also that the first
foot-track scare took place.

This is an interesting story in several ways, and has naturally been
received with whoops of joy by the skeptics. The story is from the
*Humboldt Times* of January 3, 1959, and reads:

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

**STORY OF CENTURY OLD BIGFOOT IN IDAHO ADDS COLOR TO LEGEND**: by Betty
Allen, Times Correspondent: Willow Creek—Mrs. Alvin Bortles, Boise,
Idaho, discussed an account of a "Big Foot" who lived prior to 1868 in
the wilderness of Idaho.

The mother of Kenneth Bortles, vice principal of the Hoopa valley high
school, Mrs. Bortles said that mysterious tracks of a tremendous size
and human shape stirred the residents of Idaho in the early days. Just
as with the "Big Foot" tracks of Northern California's Bluff Creek area,
some believed they were genuine, others saw in them a clever hoax.

The "Big Foot" lived in the remote wilderness of Reynold's Canyon now
known as Reynold's Creek. A thousand dollars was offered for him, dead
or alive. Here the likeness to the local "Big Foot" ended for the
"Gigantic Monster," as he was called in Idaho, was a killer. The full
extent of the depredations of this Big Foot were never known, for many
robberies and murders were attributed to him which he probably did not
commit. The sometimes wanton killings that were the work of almost
superhuman strength both with stock and humans, brought about his
downfall. A thousand dollars was offered for Big Foot dead or alive.

John Wheeler, a former army man, set out to collect the reward. In the
year 1868, he came upon Big Foot and shot him 16 times. Both legs and
one arm were broken before he fell to the ground. As he lay there he
asked for a drink of water and, because of his great fear, Wheeler shot
him, breaking his other arm before giving the water to the creature.
Before he died, he told Wheeler that his real name was Starr Wilkerson
and he had been born in the Cherokee nation of a white father. His
mother was part Cherokee and part Negro. Even as a very small boy
everyone had called him "Big Foot" and made fun of him. At the age of

</div>

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

19 the white girl he loved jilted him for another. Gathering a small
band of men about him he killed then, for the sheer love of killing.
Later he killed the girl that he had loved.

The foot length of this great giant of a man was 17½ inches and 18
inches around the ball of the foot. His height was 6 feet, 8 inches,
with a chest measurement of 59 inches, and his weight was estimated at
300 pounds. He was all bone and sinew, no surplus flesh. He was known to
have traveled as far as 60 or 75 miles in a 24-hour period.

Adelaide Hawes gives an account of Starr Wilkerson or "Big Foot" in her
book, The Valley of the Tall Grass, written in 1950.

</div>

I have other old stories from Idaho, mostly of sheep being torn apart
and monstrous human-like footprints by water holes, but nothing ever
came of them. There is one story, however, that has always impressed me.
This is told by none other than Theodore Roosevelt in a book he
published in 1892 entitled *Wilderness Hunter*. Teddy was not a boy to
be taken in by anybody much, and he was a great skeptic and debunker,
especially in the field of wildlife, being the originator of that most
excellent expression of opprobrium, "Nature-Faker." This story seems to
have impressed him not a little and mostly because of the still
noticeable terror of the teller, half a lifetime later. He was an old
man when he talked to Roosevelt and the incident had happened when he
was young. His name was Bauman and he was born in the area on the then
frontier, and had spent all his life as a hunter and trapper.
Roosevelt's account goes as follows:

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

It was told \[to me\] by a grizzled, weather-beaten old mountain hunter,
named Bauman, who was born and had passed all his life on the frontier.
He must have believed what he said, for he could hardly repress a
shudder at certain points of the tales.

When the event occurred Bauman was still a young man, and was trapping
with a partner among the mountains dividing the forks of the Salmon from
the head of Wisdom river. Not having had much luck, he and his partner
determined to go up into a particularly wild and lonely pass through
which ran a small stream said to contain many beaver. The pass had an
evil reputation because the year before a solitary hunter who had
wandered into it was there slain, seemingly by a wild beast, the
half-eaten remains being afterwards found by some mining prospectors who
had passed his camp only the night before.

</div>

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

The memory of this event, however, weighed very lightly with the two
trappers, who were as adventurous and hardy as others of their kind. …
They then struck out on foot through the vast, gloomy forest, and in
about 4 hours reached a little open glade where they concluded to camp,
as signs of game were plenty.

There was still an hour or two of daylight left, and after building a
brush lean-to and throwing down and opening their packs, they started up
stream. …

At dusk they again reached camp. …

They were surprised to find that during their absence something,
apparently a bear, had visited camp, and had rummaged about among their
things, scattering the contents of their packs, and in sheer wantonness
destroying their lean-to. The footprints of the beast were quite plain,
but at first they paid no particular heed to them, busying themselves
with rebuilding the lean-to, laying out their beds and stores, and
lighting the fire.

While Bauman was making ready supper, it being already dark, his
companion began to examine the tracks more closely, and soon took a
brand from the fire to follow them up, where the intruder had walked
along a game trail after leaving the camp.… Coming back to the fire, he
stood by it a minute or two, peering out into the darkness, and suddenly
remarked: "Bauman, that bear has been walking on two legs." Bauman
laughed at this, but his partner insisted that he was right, and upon
again examining the tracks with a torch, they certainly did seem to be
made by but two paws, or feet. However, it was too dark to make sure.
After discussing whether the footprints could possibly be those of a
human being, and coming to the conclusion that they could not be, the
two men rolled up in their blankets, and went to sleep under the
lean-to.

At midnight Bauman was awakened by some noise, and sat up in his
blankets. As he did so his nostrils were struck by a strong, wild-beast
odor, and he caught the loom of a great body in the darkness at the
mouth of the lean-to. Grasping his rifle, he fired at the vague,
threatening shadow, but must have missed, for immediately afterwards he
heard the smashing of the underwood as the thing, whatever it was,
rushed off into the impenetrable blackness of the forest and the night.

After this the two men slept but little, sitting up by the rekindled
fire, but they heard nothing more. In the morning they started out to
look at the few traps they had set the previous evening and put out new
ones. By an unspoken agreement they kept together all day, and returned
to camp towards evening.

On nearing it they saw, hardly to their astonishment, that the lean-to

</div>

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

had been again torn down. The visitor of the preceding day had returned,
and in wanton malice had tossed about their camp kit and bedding, and
destroyed the shanty. The ground was marked up by its tracks, and on
leaving the camp it had gone along the soft earth by the brook, where
the footprints were as plain as if on snow, and, after a careful
scrutiny of the trail, it certainly did seem as if, whatever the thing
was, it had walked off on but two legs.

The men thoroughly uneasy, gathered a great heap of dead logs, and kept
up a roaring fire throughout the night, one or the other sitting on
guard most of the time. About midnight the thing came down through the
forest opposite, across the brook, and stayed there on the hill-side for
nearly an hour. They could hear the branches crackle as it moved about,
and several times it uttered a harsh, grating, long-drawn moan, a
peculiarly sinister sound. Yet it did not venture near the fire.

In the morning the two trappers, after discussing the strange events of
the last 36 hours, decided that they would shoulder their packs and
leave the valley that afternoon.…

All the morning they kept together, picking up trap after trap, each one
empty. On first leaving camp they had the disagreeable sensation of
being followed. In the dense spruce thickets they occasionally heard a
branch snap after they had passed; and now and then there were slight
rustling noises among the small pines to one side of them.

At noon they were back within a couple of miles of camp. In the high,
bright sunlight their fears seemed absurd to the two armed men,
accustomed as they were, through long years of lonely wandering in the
wilderness to face every kind of danger from man, brute, or element.
There were still three beaver traps to collect from a little pond in a
wide ravine near by. Bauman volunteered to gather these and bring them
in, while his companion went ahead to camp and made ready the packs.

On reaching the pond Bauman found 3 beavers in the traps, one of which
had been pulled loose and carried into a beaver house. He took several
hours in securing and preparing the beaver, and when he started
homewards he marked, with some uneasiness how low the sun was getting….

At last he came to the edge of the little glade where the camp lay, and
shouted as he approached it, but got no answer. The camp fire had gone
out, though the thin blue smoke was still curling upwards. Near it lay
the packs wrapped and arranged. At first Bauman could see nobody; nor
did he receive an answer to his call. Stepping forward he again shouted,
and as he did so his eye fell on the body of his friend, stretched

</div>

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

beside the trunk of a great fallen spruce. Rushing towards it the
horrified trapper found that the body was still warm, but that the neck
was broken, while there were four great fang marks in the throat.

The footprints of the unknown beast-creature, printed deep in the soft
soil, told the whole story.

The unfortunate man, having finished his packing, had sat down on the
spruce log with his face to the fire, and his back to the dense woods,
to wait for his companion.… It had not eaten the body, but apparently
had romped and gambolled round it in uncouth, ferocious glee,
occasionally rolling over and over it; and had then fled back into the
soundless depths of the woods.

Bauman, utterly unnerved, and believing that the creature with which he
had to deal was something either half human or half devil, some great
goblin-beast, abandoned everything but his rifle and struck off at speed
down the pass, not halting until he reached the beaver meadows where the
hobbled ponies were still grazing. Mounting, he rode onwards through the
night, until far beyond the reach of pursuit.

</div>

Judged by the time of publication of this story and what the old man
said, this must have taken place in the early 1800's. Conditions changed
radically about those parts in the 1850's, but then, strangely, they
lapsed once more into a form of oblivion and, despite the incredible
advance of civilization and the complete opening up of the whole West,
until it stands today as second to no other area in the Union, parts of
it are really less known now than they were a hundred years ago. I have
observed this strange progress of progress in action in other lands,
notably in the Republic of Haiti. The population of that small Caribbean
country is so enormous that the whole of it, and right up its towering
mountains, is virtually one great garden-city. You can stand anywhere
and spit in three directions and be sure to hit somebody's compound.
When the troubles took place in the 1920's and the American Marines took
over, they built motorable roads in a network all over the country. Then
they left; but at the same time there came the commercial airplane. By
1940 you just couldn't find any of the roads made by the Marines, while
a new network was being built that went roaring straight through the
country from one important center to another. All in between had gone
right

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

back to conditions pertaining before the advent of the Marines, and in
some large areas apparently to those pertaining before Columbus. So also
with great pieces of our own country.

It was during this initial period of lapse, or collapse, that we once
again pick up our tracks. The strangest story is that of Capt. Joseph
Walker, an account of which lies in the files of a paper called the
*Eureka Daily Leader*, dated February 14, 1879. This recounts that this
gentleman, who was then a most renowned mountaineer, trapper, and guide,
due to his many exploits in the Rockies, had recently returned from
investigating a newly opened territory near the mouth of New York Canyon
and had brought to the office of the Leader a slab of sandstone about 20
inches long and 14 inches wide and some 3 inches thick. "On the surface
of this slab of sandstone was imprinted the clear form of a gigantic
footprint \[I am quoting here\], perfect except for the tip of the great
toe. The footprint measured 14½ inches from the end of the heel to the
tip of the toe and was 6 inches wide across the ball of the foot.
Captain Walker related how he had found the slab of sandstone formation
under about 2 feet of sand."

This story has sundry rather odd features. First, a foot 14 ½ inches by
6 inches across the ball is hardly a gigantic foot compared to what is
coming in a moment, but it has a plantar index of 2.42 which is much
wider than a human foot and would give an impression of great size. The
fact that it was impressed in a slab of sandstone might at first sound
more than just suspicious because you can't impress anything into solid
rock—you have to chip it out. However, and this should be borne in mind,
sandstone can form in a matter of days under certain conditions. A
surface of argillaceous sand may dry out under a hot sun and remain
baked to the consistency of pottery for months. If then a flood brings
down a layer of sand or other material and deposits this on top of it
and also immediately dries out, you may get conditions similar to those
that pertained in our Porcupine cage at my zoo. More drying, compression
and the solution and percolation of, say, lime from the covering layer
may then, in only a few years, solidify

the bottom layer and turn it to a sandstone. I have seen car tire tracks
in sandstone so solid you needed a cold chisel to chip it.

Captain Walker was not a man to be fooled either and he retained a high
reputation so that Walker River was named after him by the Federal
Government. He was, in fact, solidly on the right track!

<span id="fn_11"></span>[96:\*](abs09.htm#fr_11.md) This is a funny word.
Does it imply that sometimes it *can* be found?

<span id="fn_12"></span>[100:\*](abs09.htm#fr_12.md) In the article
mentioned above in True Magazine, an extra zero unfortunately became
attached to the area given, a mistake that started with my typing but
went clean through to the published story. This resulted in a deluge of
several thousand letters. But, when it had been corrected, just as many
people wrote scoffing at the true figure. Many of these were
Californians; and some even from the counties concerned!
