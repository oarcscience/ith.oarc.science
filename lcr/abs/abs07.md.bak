### 3. Further Sasquatchery

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

What are you going to do with a new story when you've got one? How do
you know it is not an old one plastered over with new facts?

</div>

Just because I have skipped over some 60 years by the recounting of only
8 stories, is not to be taken to mean that these were the only reports
current during that period. Quite to the contrary, almost every year
somebody or some group of people in southern British Columbia stated
that they had either run into a *Sasquatch*, been chased by one, shot at
one, or seen its foot-tracks. Many of these accounts are from our
friends, the Amerinds, and many of them are not specifically dated. They
begin "Some years ago …" or "Early last year …" but fail to state which
year, or how many years ago. A lot of these have become garbled because
of loose reporting or because they were made to specialists in local
languages, each of which has a different name for its local ABSMs. The
very name, *Sasquatch*, now so widely disseminated and known in Canada,
is actually of partially artificial construction and was first, I
understand, coined by Mr. Burns in an effort to obviate some of this
muddle and to draw attention to the fact that throughout a very wide
area—from the Yukon to California—all the names refer to the same
creature. This name is derived from the Salish Amerindian word for
"wild-men of the woods" which may be transliterated as *Te* *Smai'Etl
Soqwaia'm*, also written as *Sami "Soq"* *wia'm*, the form used by the
Chehalis tribal group. Farther south among the Pugets, the name was
*Hoquiam*, now the name of a flourishing small town on the Chehalis
River south of the Olympic Mountains in Washington State. However, many
of the locals had a habit

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

of prefixing almost everything with a sibilant so that this name also
came as *S'oq'wiam*. In the Cascades the name was *See-ah-tik* but down
around Mt. Shasta it was *See-oh-mah*. In the Klamaths we note that it
is still Oh-Mah among the Hŭppa, while the Yuroks call them
*Toki-mussi*. On Vancouver Island, and north up the inlets of the
mainland, the sound changes to something more like "*Sokqueatl*" or
"*Soss-q'atl*" and it was from this that Mr. Burns derived the
anglicized "*Sasquatch*," or "*Susquotch*" as Americans have usually
written it.

I mentioned above that all these names refer to a single kind of
creature. This is so, as far as the Amerinds are concerned; but, you may
well ask as you read on, how come these creatures are stated to vary so
much in appearance. On analysis, it will be noted that this variation is
almost exclusively in two features—length and quality of hair and its
disposal about the body, and color of skin and fur. Further analysis
will also show that these differences seem to be due to age and sex. The
young ones, like Jacko and the one shot by a local hunter and to be
described in a moment, are said to have had light faces and yet black,
shiny, straight, and apparently orderly hair all over (one imagines like
that of a chimpanzee), but the adults are invariably said to have black
faces and skin, and reddish-brown fur, often shaggy, and sometimes
washed with white or silver-tipped. The matter of long head-hair is
variable but most of the close-up sightings speak of very short
head-hair, no beard, but a curiously forward, upward, and finally
backward curl of longer hair all across the brow like that seen on
certain Spider Monkeys (genus *Ateles*) . I reproduce a photograph of a
sketch that I made under the direction of Mr. Ostman during our
interview, that emphasizes this strange feature. ([See Fig.
41.](abs04.htm#img_pl41).md)

The growth and rearrangement of body hair with age is absolutely
consistent with what is known among other mammals and notably primates
and particularly apes. Further, the changes in color are exactly what we
would expect and are very similar to those to be noted among gorillas
and some gibbons. Baby chimpanzees often start off with faces and

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

This represents an area of some 270,000 square miles. Ninety per cent of
this is uninhabited, despite the enormous conglomeration of the City of
Vancouver, the old capital of Victoria on Vancouver Island, and the
somewhat extensive cultivated areas on that island and about the lower
reaches of the Frazer River from Agassiz west. The coastal plains of
Puget Sound add only 2 per cent. The whole of it, apart from Vancouver
Island, the Frazer delta, and the Puget Sound area, is mightily
mountainous and great parts are not truly explored, though there are now
excellent large-scale maps resultant from aerial surveys. The Olympic
Mountains and the coastal fringe northward around Vancouver Island and
north of the lower Frazer River are clothed in an immensely tall,
several-layered "Rain Forest" with conifers predominating (the largest
trees in the world are found here) and choked with mosses, ferns, and a
broadleafed undergrowth. The other areas are heavily forested but for
their peaks.

</div>

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

hands the color of those of white men but end up with complexions as
dark as Dravidians or Wolofs. Some gorillas develop a distinct gingery
tinge—the "black" of mammalian hair being only melanin, and really a
very dark red—and almost all of them go silvery gray with age. Some
gorilla families have bright red topknots just like some human beings.
Some gibbons vary in a most bewildering way in coat colors. They may be
black, gray, chocolate, white, or beige to start with and throughout
life, or they may change from one color to another with age. Different
races of the different species do all manner of different things in this
respect. It is therefore quite consistent that these large ABSMs should
start off with jet black hair and light skins, and end up hoary old
black-faced creatures with silver-tipped reddish fur. The females might
lack the gray and might be less shaggy. There may also be family
likenesses to start with.

Let us assume that we are now chronologically at the turn of the year
1920 to 1921 but still in British Columbia. As I said in the brief
historical review of world-wide ABSMery, this was a most important date
in that it saw the birth of the term "Abominable Snowman" and really
kicked off the whole

 

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

thing. I have often wondered what would have happened if the Squamish
word for these creatures in their country, instead, had happened to have
been mistranslated as something equally fetching. I suppose we would
then, in time, have witnessed a *New* *York Journal American* Expedition
to Harrison Lakes, and Admiral Byrd flying skin-trophies to Chicago from
the hamlets of the Alaskan panhandle. It is nothing more than a quirk of
history and a series of harmless mistakes that has put Nepal instead of
Vancouver Island on the map in this respect; though it has to be
admitted that Mt. Everest has played its part.

It was about this time, moreover, that an incident is alleged to have
occurred in this area that is in many ways perhaps one of the most
fantastic ABSM stories ever told. It only came to light in 1957 but
concerns happenings alleged to have taken place in 1924 in the mountains
behind Toba Inlet, which is on the coast of British Columbia (see [Map
II](#img_map02).md). It came to light through a letter (written to John
Green, owner of *The Advance*, published in Agassiz, a small town near
Harrison, some 70 miles from Vancouver) by a retired prospector and
lumberman of Swedish origin named Mr. Albert Ostman. This letter was a
result of the publication by Mr. Green of an affidavit sworn to by a Mr.
William Roe (now of Edmonton, Alberta) concerning certain experiences he
had in the year 1955 on Mica Mountain on the Alberta border. (This
latter statement is reproduced in full in the next chapter and concerns
Mr. Roe's meeting with a female *Sasquatch*.) Reading this, Mr. Ostman
apparently decided to break more than a quarter century of silence and
relate what had happened to him. Mr. Ostman now lives at Fort Langley
outside Chilliwack, and John Green, who for years has gathered
information on the *Sasquatches*, sought him out and persuaded him to
write his full story. This Mr. Ostman did—painstakingly, and in two
large notebooks. John Green published this in his newspaper along with a
photostat of a sworn affidavit testifying to its truth by Mr. Ostman.

I had the pleasure of meeting both gentlemen in company

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

with a partner of mine, Robert Christie, who was traveling with me at
the time, and a Mr. and Mrs. René Dahinden. He is Swiss; his wife,
Swedish, as is Mr. Ostman. As I already had Mr. Ostman's story both on
paper and on tape from an interview between him and a reporter from a
local radio station, I confined my questions to trying to recall his
memory about certain zoological or anthropological details. I fully
admit to having loaded these questions with snares and abstruse
technical catches, and to having been rather rough in my approach. I
know that I thereby incensed John Green and the Dahindens, who not only
have a very great affection and respect for Mr. Ostman but feel that,
with his still slight language difficulty, outsiders such as I tend to
rattle him. I do not agree, in that Mr. Ostman has the wisdom of age as
well as long experience, and a sense of humor that cannot be downed; and
I don't think that he was annoyed with me then, or will be hurt if he
reads this. In fact, I felt that he was twinkling at me all the time;
and I fancy that, if he ever thought of me after I left, it was simply
as a "very funny fellow," as he might say. This is more the case since I
went away a very puzzled reporter.

This story, when read cold, sounds utterly preposterous. If one has read
a great deal on ABSMs in general and on the *Sasquatch* in particular it
also, at first, appears highly suspicious because it seems to knit
together just about everything else that has ever been published on the
matter. In fact, given some firsthand experience of the country, I could
have written just that story myself. The world is full of good weavers
of yarns and some of them, who are not professional writers of fiction,
can be so damnably convincing that they have fooled not only the press
but governments and even peoples, if not the whole world. Fabrications,
if well enough done, consistently adhered to, and big enough lies, can,
as has so often been pointed out (e.g. the case of Hitler) be utterly
convincing. However, in technical matters, and most notably in the bio-
logical sciences, there are subjects that just cannot be imagined or
thought up by anybody, unless they have learned of them

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

specifically in advance and, what is much more important, their exact
significance relative to a whole host of other technicalities is
appreciated. Anybody can read everything that has been published on
*Sasquatches* and yet still attribute to them some trivial biological
character that really is *impossible*. In the case of ABSMs there are a
large number of very abstruse matters of this nature that may be slipped
in casually. Only one answer to these can be right, while an endless
string of other answers will be wrong, and conclusively so. I put about
two dozen of such, directly and unexpectedly, to Mr. Ostman and, of all
those for which he had a reply, he did not miss once—not one impossible
answer; not a single uncalled-for elaboration; and not one unrequested
fact that did not have a possible and quite logical place in the general
picture. What is more, when we got off on the sketching of the
creature's head, there emerged several points that were not then in
published *Sasquatch* literature, nor in that on any ABSM, nor even in
textbooks of physical anthropology. Yet, subsequent to that interview,
some of these points (such as the odd head-shape) *have* appeared in the
last type of publication.

This is really rather alarming and has given me many sleepless nights.
Some things I just cannot bring myself to take at their face evaluation;
and, frankly, Mr. Ostman's story was at first one of these. Besides, he
even included some gross fallacies such as that he became poisoned
through eating a broody grouse—an old wives' tale, if ever there was
one. But then, I have to admit to myself now, that this fact is still
believed in parts of his home country—namely, that one does get poisoned
by eating birds taken sitting on eggs—and that he probably believed
this; while he was in poor enough condition at the time of his adventure
to be made sick by almost anything. Also, I ask myself, why tell this
story? Mr. Ostman is not an uneducated country bumpkin. He is well read,
speaks three languages, has traveled quite a lot, lives very much in the
world, and knows quite well what ridicule is, and all about its deadly
efficacy. He is retired, owns his own property, has

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

many friends, and does not need publicity; nor does he welcome it,
though he is extremely long-suffering and most gracious in discussing
his experiences with newsmen and others who call upon him. He never told
his story in his youth for fear of ridicule, knowing what effects it
might have. He doesn't care now: he is still sincerely puzzled; and he
is eager to do anything he can to help clear up the mystery. Mr. Ostman
is, in fact, sick and tired of skeptics.

After a strenuous year on a job, he decided to take a part vacation with
some prospecting on the side. He chose a wild area at the head of this
Toba Inlet which is the first substantial fjord north of Powell River.
This is on the mainland opposite the middle of Vancouver Island. There
was allegedly a lost gold mine thereabouts and he decided to take a
crack at finding it. He hired an old Amerind to take him up the fjord
and he says that he first heard from him on that journey of the
existence of the giant hairy "Wild Men of the Woods." He had supplies
for three weeks, plus rifle, sleeping bag, and other basic equipment.
The local man left him alone on shore and he proceeded inland and found
a good campsite.

This he fixed up very comfortably, making a thick bed of small branches
on which to place his sleeping bag, and hung his supply bags well off
the ground on a pole. The next morning he, nonetheless, found his things
disturbed, though nothing was missing. Being a knowledgeable woodsman,
he assumed that a porcupine was responsible, so the following night he
loaded his rifle and placed it under his bed flap. The next morning he
found, to his dismay, that his packsack still hung from the pole well
off the ground but that its contents had been emptied out and some items
of food taken. Strangely, his salt had not been touched. This surprised
him not a little, because porcupines have an insatiable craving for salt
and always go for it first. At the same time, he did not think that it
was a bear because, although he admits to having been a very heavy
sleeper, bears usually make a great rumpus and smash up everything.
Albert Ostman did not like these events one bit, so he stayed rather
closely around camp in the hopes

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

of catching the marauder in the act. On the third night he took special
precautions; intending to stay awake all night, he did not undress but
merely removed his boots and left them at the bottom of his sleeping
bag, put his geological pick to hand, and took his loaded rifle into the
bag with him. But he did fall asleep.

The next thing he knew he was being picked up like a puppy in a paper
bag, and felt himself heaved, as he at first thought, on to a horse's
back. Bemused and half awake, he tried to get at his knife to cut his
way out of his sleeping bag, but he was wedged down into the bottom in a
sitting position and could not reach it. Then he felt his packsack
bumping against him with the hard cans within clearly discernible by
their sharp impact. As far as I was able to ascertain in my interview
with him, he was completely in the bag, as one might say, and its
opening was being held shut above his head. How he managed to breathe in
such circumstances, and for over an hour, puzzled me until he explained
that he was slung over the back of something walking on two legs and
that its hand was not big enough to go all around the bag-opening. I
never heard Mr. Ostman say that he was scared, but he admits that he was
terribly hot in there and that his cramped legs were extremely painful.
Don't forget, moreover, that he hadn't a clue at that time as to what
was going on or what had got him.

He says that he was carried up hill and down dale, when he was dragged
along the ground, and that his carrier even jog-trotted over level
places. This is some going for anything carrying a man of Ostman's size
plus a knapsack full of supplies and other equipment. But, this is by no
means the strangest part of the proceedings; yet it is still at least
possible. Another aspect seems quite impossible; namely, that Ostman
estimates—and sticks to it—that this trip in the bag took three hours.
In an interview with a commentator from a radio station (a tape of which
I have), but made, of course, a quarter of a century later, he says
thirty miles. Personally, I fail to see how he survived such an ordeal,
stuffed up in a bag, but that is not so much the point: what is are the
time, the distances

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

and the speed of travel implied. These are not easy things to estimate
at the best of times, and they are among the first to become exaggerated
in the mind with the passage of time. I wish that Mr. Ostman had not
tried to give any estimates at such a late date since it causes the
eyebrows of all who read or hear his story to go up sharply.

Anyhow, at the end of what must have been an ordeal, however brief it
really was, he was dumped unceremoniously on the ground. He heard some
voices gibbering but not using true speech as far as he could ascertain.
He apparently got his head out of the bag for air and then tried to
crawl out, but his legs had rather naturally gone numb and it was some
time before he could emerge and rescue his boots. It was still dark and
starting to rain. He then tells, in various characteristic ways, what
happened when it began to dawn and he could see the outlines of four
large creatures on two legs around him. I don't know if his native
Swedish wit got the better of him, but he says that when he could stand
up he asked the somewhat banal question: "What do you chaps want with
me?" I find this most refreshing.

He found that his captors consisted of two big ones (a pair), and two
youngsters, also a male and a female. He stresses that the two latter
seemed thoroughly scared of him, and that the "Old Woman," as he rather
delightfully called the elder female, seemed very peeved with her mate
for dragging such an object home; but, he then goes on to say—and this I
find very interesting, if odd—that the "Old Man" kept gesticulating, and
*telling* the others all about it. In other words, their gibbering *was*
speech. All of them were hairy and without clothing; and Ostman
estimates the "Old Man" to have been between seven and eight feet tall.
When the sun was fully up, they all left him.

He says that he found himself in a ten-acre bowl high in the mountains,
its edges so steep as to be unscalable, and with only one outlet—a
V-shaped cut with walls about twenty feet high and about eight feet wide
at the bottom. It is not quite clear why, at this point, he did not try
to make a break for

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

this gap, but this was possibly because of his still wobbly legs. Later
on, he made several attempts, both frontally at speed and by subtlety,
but the "Old Man" kept a weather eye on him and invariably cut off his
approach, making "*pushing*" motions with his hands, and a sound that
Ostman invariably describes as something like "sooka-sooka." However,
when he first arrived, he moved over to the opposite side of the bowl
and set up camp under two small trees. I find the inventory that he says
he took of his possessions most interesting. Prunes, macaroni, his full
box of rifle cartridges, and his matches were missing; so was his pick.
Otherwise, all was intact. He had an emergency waterproof box of matches
in his pocket but says that there was no dry wood in the valley, which
seems to have been open and grassy with a few scattered junipers. All
his cooking utensils had also been left, but he opened a coffee-can and
went to look for water.

I will now complete the story as best I can from the various versions
that I have heard, though I would stress that Mr. Ostman is remarkably
consistent however many times he tells his story. Each interviewer,
however, manages to ask a new question and elicit from him some scraps
of information that the teller had not thought of or mentioned before.
As I don't know the sequence in which the various versions were
recorded, I have no way of differentiating between inconsistencies and
mere additions. It would seem that Ostman made his first attempt to get
out on the second day but was driven back by the "Old Man." The young
male kept coming closer to him and he finally rolled his empty snuff box
to him. The *Sasquatch* grabbed it, showed it to his sister, and then
took it to his father. Somehow, Ostman got it back, because he used it
later. During the next five days nothing much seems to have occurred
except that the young male gave Ostman some grass with sweet roots to
eat and got some snuff in return, which he chewed. The "Old Man" then
also developed a liking for snuff; and this finally did the trick.

On the seventh day, as far as I can make out, the boy and the "Old Man"
came right up to Ostman and squatted down

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

watching him take a pinch of snuff. Ostman held out the box to him (the
"Old Man") who, instead of taking a pinch in imitation, grabbed the box
and emptied its whole contents into his mouth and swallowed it. In a few
minutes his eyes began to roll, he let out a screech, and grabbed a can
half full of cold coffee and coffee-grounds, which he drank. This made
him worse; and, after rolling about some more, he charged off to the
spring. Ostman gathered up his possessions and made a dash for the
opening in the cliff. The "Old Lady" tried to intercept him and was very
close on his heels, but he fired a shot at the rock above her head and
she fled back again. Ostman found himself in a canyon running south,
down which he made record time, as he put it. Then, he climbed a ridge
and saw Mount Baker way off to the side, so that he knew which way to go
to hit the coast. He was not followed.

He rested for two hours on the ridge, then started down again. That
night he camped near heavy timber and shot a grouse sitting on eggs; he
roasted and ate the bird. The next morning he was very groggy and
stomachically upset, which he attributed to eating the grouse, since it
was his belief that a broody bird was poisonous. Finally, he heard a
motor running and made for it, coming out at an advance logging
operation. The foreman, seeing that he was just about at the end of his
tether, took him in and fed him and let him rest up for a couple of
days. Ostman then made his way down to a camp on the Salmon Arm Branch
of the Sechelt Inlet, where he got a boat back to Vancouver.

This is Mr. Ostman's story and you may make what you will of it. As I
have said, there are some curious discrepancies in it but not even these
are impossibilities, with the exception of the times and the distances
as mentioned above. The grouse, broody or not, could quite well have
upset his stomach. Mr. Ostman seems to be a straightforward and honest
man. But, it is the facts that he gave me about the ABSMs themselves
that go farther than anything else to convince me of the validity of the
whole thing—unless, of course, as I have also said above, he read all of
these elsewhere.

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

His descriptions of the creatures are considerably detailed. What is
more, the sexual and age differences he describes are very reasonable,
and do not in any way insult such variations as found among men or other
primates. Of the adult male, he says that he was about eight feet tall,
barrel-chested, with powerful shoulders and a very pronounced and large
"hump" on his back, causing his head to be carried somewhat forward.
This is exactly in accord with the posture of some sub-hominids as
deducted from the angle at which the condyles are set to the back of the
skull. The biceps were said to be enormous but to taper to the inside of
the elbow; the forearm to be disproportionately (to a human) long but
well proportioned. The hands were wide but the palm long and curved
permanently into "a kind of a scoop"; the fingers short, and the nails
flat, broad, and "shaped like chisels." Mr. Ostman mentioned to me quite
casually that they were copper-colored. This is most significant, as we
shall see later (Chapter 14) . He estimated the neck to be about thirty
inches around. The whole body was covered in hair, somewhat longer on
the head; shorter but thicker in other parts. It covered his ears. Only
the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet, which had pronounced
pads, were naked and a dirty dark gray in color. The "top" (i.e. bridge)
of the nose and eyelids alone were naked. The big male's canine teeth
were longer than the others but not sufficiently so to be called tusks.

The adult female he described as being over seven feet tall and weighing
between 500 and 600 pounds. He said that she could have been anywhere
between forty and seventy years old, using humans as a criterion; but,
she was apparently very ugly, with an enormously wide pelvis that caused
her to walk like a goose. She had long, large, and pendent breasts.

The young male spent the most time near Ostman and was thus most closely
observed. Ostman says that he could have been anywhere from eleven to
eighteen years of age, but was already seven feet tall and weighed about
300 pounds. His chest would have measured between fifty and fifty-five
inches around and his waist some twenty-six to thirty-eight inches:

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

and don't forget that Mr. Ostman was a lumberman and better at
estimating the girth of things (like trees) than the average person. He
had wide jaws and a narrow, sloping forehead. The back of his head, as
in all of them, apparently rose some four or five inches above the
brow-line, and was pointed. Mr. Ostman went to great pains to explain
this, and to get the shape just right, as shown in the sketch that I
made under his direction (see [Fig. 41](abs04.htm#img_pl41).md) The
head-hair was about six inches long; that on the body shorter but much
thicker in some areas.

The young female was very shy; she did not approach Ostman closely but
kept peeking at him from behind the bushes. He could not estimate her
age, but remarks that she was without any visible breast development and
was, in fact, quite flat-chested. Like her mother, she had a very
pronounced up-curled bang across her brow-ridges. This was continuous
from temple to temple. Curiously, no amount of questioning would prompt
Mr. Ostman to elaborate any further on this individual, which may in
part be psychological since it seems to be his conviction that he had
been kidnaped as a potential suitor for her, and I think he has a sort
of subconscious and rather touching modesty about her shyness. Mr.
Ostman maintains a delightful old-world delicacy about the proprieties
and neatly turned aside some purely biological questions with such
noncommittal phrases as "I wouldn't know about that." But he did tell us
of a few most interesting observations on the behavior of the group.

First and foremost was this gibbering in which they indulged. As his
story progresses, it becomes quite clear that he assumed in the end that
they were actually communicating intelligently, since they made a
variety of noises befitting special situations and seemed to discuss the
objects they carried one to the other. There was also the delightful
expression "ook" that the young male made on one occasion. Then, almost
equally significant, was the fact that the old female and the young male
went regularly to gather vegetable foods; the former going out of the
gap and returning with armsful of

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

branches, including fresh spruce and hemlock tips, grasses, and ferns.
These, he told me, she washed and stacked up. She also brought
quantities of a certain kind of "ground nut" of a kind that Mr. Ostman
had often seen in abundance on Vancouver Island. (Shades of Mike King!)
Inquiry elicited the fact that this is a root-nodule of a herbaceous
plant related to the Hemlock of Europe (not the tree called by that name
in this continent), one form of which grows such nutlike growths that
are edible and, in fact, delicious. The young male used also to go every
day and return with bundles of a kind of grass with a "sweet root."

Mr. Ostman stressed the incredible climbing ability of the male
youngster and remarked on the form of his and his father's feet as
having an enormous big toe. At one point he states that, in order to get
a purchase in climbing, all he would need would be to find a resting
place for this toe alone.

One of Mr. Ostman's observations is very peculiar, and is one which can
be taken either as evidence that the whole thing is a wild fabrication
or as glowing testimony to the recorder's veracity and powers of
observation. It brings up some very fundamental matters with regard to
the history of culture among early hominids—if it proves to be true,
that is. This was that, according to Mr. Ostman, the four creatures
slept and lived for the most part under a rock-ledge like the
rock-shelters known to have been favored by many Stone Age men. In this,
which was some ten feet deep and thirty feet wide, he says that they had
regular beds of branches, moss, and dry grass, and that they had
coverlets of woven strips of bark, forming great flattened bags, *and
stuffed with dry grasses and moss*. However, I could not elicit from Mr.
Ostman any facts as to whether he visited the shelter and examined these
objects or, if not, how he knew so much about their construction and
composition. This worried, and still worries, me.

Should such items have existed, combined with the primitive speech, the
collection of food and its washing, we are faced with a pretty problem.
Are we to suppose that, prior to

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

the use of bone and horn tools (such as the little very primitive
Australopithecines of South Africa are now thought to have used) and the
discovery and control of fire, hominids (man or otherwise) went through
a prior period of food-gathering but still knew weaving? This would seem
not to be unreasonable or illogical, though even crude weaving calls for
considerable dexterity. Be it noted at the same time that Orangs,
Chimps, and Gorillas tie true knots when making their sleeping platforms
on occasion, while some Gorillas do so regularly. Weaving in its most
primitive form, moreover, is little further advanced than excessive
knot-tying; besides, some birds do the most incredibly accurate jobs of
weaving, even with different colored wools, on a piece of small-mesh
wire. Also, animals, and particularly the primates, definitely do
communicate. (I may say that even I can speak fairly good Rhesus!)

Thus, there is nothing really outrageous about Mr. Ostman's statements
about these creatures nor about the whole concept of some of the
*Sasquatches* (Neo-Giants, as we shall eventually come to call them)
being food-collectors, with a primitive speech but lacking fire,
clothes, and tools. And, it is even more interesting to note that Mr.
Ostman states clearly that he never saw them bring to their camp, or
eat, any animal food. The most primitive sub-sub-hominids were probably,
like their close congeners (the apes), fruit- and leaf-eaters. Only when
some of them were forced out onto the savannahs, scrublands, and deserts
did they have to take up animal-hunting and become partially or wholly
carnivorous, as, apparently, did the Australopithecines of South Africa.
If the Great Apes, still living today, have continued to be pure
vegetarians, there is no reason why some of the most primitive Hominids
could not also have so continued to be. This gives us a somewhat new
concept of our own background and of the possibilities for ABSMs.

This brings up several questions that, if it were possible, ought to be
discussed concurrently with any straight reportage on the ABSMs
themselves. The details of a report on any such

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

alleged creature cannot be evaluated properly without prior knowledge or
exposition of certain aspects, on the one hand, of vegatology and, on
the other, of palaeanthropology, both physical and cultural. Our whole
outlook on the last of these fields has undergone a complete revolution
in the past two decades. The old idea was that sub-Hominids had bent
knees, a stooped gait, ape-like faces and teeth and tiny brains, and no
"culture" at all, in that they had no speech, no fire, no tools. Then,
it was also previously believed, sub-Men came along that stood more
upright and were bigger-brained and less apelike about the muzzle. These
creatures were assumed to have invented tools by bashing at things with
stones, which often cracked, giving them cutting edges. The usual idea
was that they were hunters and lived in caves, and progressed steadily
toward Man, though taking an inordinately long time about it. Finally,
some of them developed such big brains and pushed-in faces that they
became true Men.

Meantime, their tools got better and better, finer made, and more
diversified. Also, the great growth in certain parts of their brains
made cogent speech possible. Then, the theory went, they somehow got on
to fire and its uses as opposed to its dangers, developed "society,"
developed the art of pottery, and finally realized that from tiny seeds
tall grasses grow, so that they gave up hunting and settled down to
agriculture. And, in time, came the wheel, writing, money, and all the
other improvements that inevitably contributed to their downfall. Be
that as it may, the development of Hominid mentality, as opposed to mere
brain capacity and structure, was not much considered, being assumed
simply to have advanced along with his gray matter, since, it was then
believed, you could not be expected to assess the psychology of any
extinct creature and especially one with a brain no bigger than an
ape's.

The first real break through this massive theoretical structure was
really made by a rather dubious antiquarian named . Mr. Dawson, who
foisted upon science not only the now infamous Piltdown cranium, teeth,
and mandible, but also a

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

fraudulent tool that he himself appears to have made from a
semi-fossilized bone of some elephantine. Piltdown Man never did look
quite right but was fully accepted by physical anthropologists as a very
early and primitive man-thing but with a very large brain. Thus, his
grotesque tool was also accepted. Then, there was also some suspicion
that tools had been found in the same strata in which Dr. DuBois found
his genuine "Apeman" in Java, but the matter was rather hurriedly
suppressed. Acceptance of tools along with sub-Humans finally came with
the diggings in north China that produced Pekin Man. This was rather a
rude shock, but did not grossly disturb the neat historical sequence
then believed in. It simply meant moving tool-making back some way. The
real shocker came with Dr. Raymond Dart's discovery of enormous
quantities of bone and tooth tools most obviously and carefully worked,
which had to have been made by none other than the little
Australopithecines that were at first classed as Apes, and only
grudgingly accepted as most primitive sub-Men after the discovery that
they walked erect. Worse still, there was a strong plea made for
acceptance of the fact that they used fire as well. It then was decided
(by most, but not all, anthropologists) that the Hominids went through
what is called an odontokeratic tool-making phase before they came to
use stones.

This picture has now been considerably muddied by Dr. Leakey's
discoveries of early Chellean Man in East Africa, an appalling-looking
chap with positively immense brow ridges, but who made splendid
hand-axes of stone. Nevertheless, it is only now slowly dawning on
anthropologists that the first tools were more probably sticks, and
otherwise wooden; for the earliest Hominids were definitely vegetarians
and forest dwellers. The bone-tooth toolmakers were carnivorous. The use
of wood implies pulling twigs and branches from trees and the discovery
of the many uses of strips of bark. From this to primitive weaving is
but a step. Thus, it is quite probable that the earliest Hominids were
vegetable gatherers, using sticks and possibly the crudest weaving, and
that they so

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

equipped themselves long before they got around to breaking stones,
using fire, or even developing a true language. It is therefore most
interesting to note, as our story continues, that the only tools ever
reported in use by ABSMs have been sticks.
