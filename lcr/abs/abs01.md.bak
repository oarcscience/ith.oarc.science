### DEDICATION

To Bernard and Monique Heuvelmans

and

My own Alma

And also to the Following

Today finds a surprising host of assorted students in this odd field,
but also a few professional scientists whose labors I would like first
to note, at the same time thanking them for their long-standing
encouragement, constructive criticism, and many forms of direct help,
not only in this book but also in my other studies of similar matters.
In addition to Dr. Bernard Heuvelmans, who has become the doyen of the
whole business, these are most especially Professor W. C. Osman Hill,
presently Prosector of the Zoological Society of London; Professor
George A. Agogino, Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University
of Wyoming; Professor Teizo Ogawa, Department of Anatomy, University of
Tokyo; Professor B. F. Porshnev of the Academy of Sciences of the
U.S.S.R.; Professor Corrado Gini, President of the Institut
International de Sociologie, Rome, Italy; and Dr. John Napier, of the
Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine at the University of London,
England. Dr. Waldimir Tschernezky, of Queen Mary's College, London, has
lent me much invaluable advice; and Dr. Jorge Ibarra, Director of the
National Museum of Guatemala, has pursued more specific details for me
in his country.

There is, then, another category of students not primarily engaged in
scientific pursuits but without whose labors little would be known about
this subject, and without whose generous help this book could not have
been written. This class is headed by Tom Slick, of San Antonio, Texas,
whose work is more fully acknowledged in the course of my story. Next,
J. W. Burns of San Francisco, who has spent over half a lifetime in
pursuit of the *Sasquatches*, and John Green, newspaper publisher of
Agassiz, B.C., on whose shoulders Mr. Bums' mantle has fallen. Then,
there is my old school friend, W. M. (Gerald) Russell, and Peter Byrne,
who separately and together did so much to clarify ABSMery in the
Himalayan region. In the same class is my friend and associate, Kenneth
C. (Cal) Brown.

In still another category is a devoted and more or less dedicated little
band of my immediate associates. Foremost is my wife, who has worked
with me for over a quarter of a century—in the field, in my researches,
and on all my books—doing much more than merely typing and collating
roomfuls of material.

Next, I would like to acknowledge two of the most remarkable young men I
have had the pleasure and honor of meeting in scholarship—Rabbi Yonah N.
Ibn Aharon and Umberto Orsi. Yonah is the recipient of degrees from the
University of Yemen and a philologist of remarkable knowledge and
talents, accredited to the U.N., who obtained his M.A. degree upon
production of the first (and only) Basrai Aramaic Lexicon.

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He is, as detailed
later, conversant with all the basic dialects upon which the larger
number of languages of eastern Eurasia are today founded. Umberto Orsi
has given me vast assistance via his specialty, bibliographical
research. He is not just a literary sleuth, but a true bloodhound when
it comes to rescuing rare items from the mazes of modern libraries.
Without his invaluable assistance I would not have dared to issue this
work. Then, there is Johanna Linch, who somehow reproduced all my maps,
outside of office hours, in just two weeks. Then, too, our good friend,
Raizel Halpins, who gave great help on the manuscript, merely out of
kindness and her interest in the subject.

There come next three new friends who have given their own particular
technical skills to immeasurably further this work, and I don't quite
know how to thank them. They are, first, Ljubica Popovich and Benjamin
Rothberg, both of Philadelphia, who translated some hundred thousand
words of technical material from Russian originals of hitherto
unpublished publications of the Special Commission of the Soviet Academy
of Sciences. Coming after these two stalwarts was Ethel Waugh, who
transcribed their translations from tape recordings—including place
names in goodness knows how many languages. To all of these, and
particularly to Ben Rothberg upon whom the greatest onus devolved, I
hereby give my sincerest thanks. Actually, these three together
accomplished a work of considerable significance to anthropology, which
will, I hope, soon see the light of day in complete and technical form.

I would like to say, also, that I have been the recipient of splendid
guidance and encouragement from the Chilton Company—Book Division, both
as a whole and from all its departments. They have kept a fine old
publishing tradition in a bright new setting—a novel experience, and a
most delightful one to a latter-day writer who has seldom enjoyed such
co-operation in the past.

Finally, there is another army of good people, many named in the body of
the story but many more are not named, who have furthered the cause of
ABSMery generally by coming out with their own stories in face of
ridicule and censure so extreme as sometimes to have resulted in loss of
their jobs. These people are pioneers—if not, on occasion, actually
martyrs —in their pursuit of truth and the disproof of "official"
mendacity, prejudice, and stupidity. I can only pray that one day their
fortitude will be rewarded with full popular and scientific recognition.
