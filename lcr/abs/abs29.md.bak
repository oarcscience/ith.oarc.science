**Appendix D**

**Others Involved**

The known mammalian fauna of the Tibetan Plateau, the Pamirs, and the
Himalayan ranges is very extensive. In the last area we find a
combination of typical Eurasian and Oriental forms, together with
several unique types not found elsewhere. We are concerned, in our
discussion, only with mammals, in that other animals do not have hair;
and it has been hair above all else \[other than footprints and tracks\]
that have been brought forward in exposition of ABSMs; and especially in
these areas. Moreover, for some reason—but one which does not seem quite
logical to me—it has been the larger mammals that have been suggested as
the possible origins of these hairs which have been said to be of
*yetis*.

This actually need not be final for there are many medium-sized and
small mammals the hairs of which are just as long, and sometimes almost
as sturdy as those alleged to be from ABSMs. Some alleged ABSM
remains—i.e. the scalps displayed by Sir Edmund Hillary (see Appendix
E)—have been proved to have been made from the goatlike animal called
the Serow; while some of the Californian hairs have been identified, on
the one hand as those of a Moose \[not found in the area,
incidentally\], and on the other as "those of a large cat" \[i.e. the
belly-hairs from a Puma, *Profelis concolor*\]. Therefore it is of first
importance to list those larger mammals known from the Tibetan and
Himalayan areas that might be used to make "yeti artifacts." The most
outstanding of these are:
