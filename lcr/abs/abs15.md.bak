**11. The Great Mix-Up**

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Sometimes everything—like geography for instance—really does get
involved. Strangely, this is just when people show up at their best.*

</div>

We now turn northward and start climbing, and we are going to need maps
as we never needed them before. The area of the world which we are now
approaching is perhaps the most puzzling and, to us, seemingly the most
mixed-up in the world. The political situation is bad enough (see [Map
IX](#img_map09).md) but the topography is frankly awful, so that even a
physical map is utterly confusing. This confusion, moreover, is worse
confounded by our use of "feet" for measuring altitude. In this area
they just aren't big enough, and maps showing the usual contour changes
of color at 600, 1500, 3000, 12,000, and 18,000 foot levels end up as
one glorious mishmash in which the main and basic features of the land
are obscured. If, however, we do our measuring (and coloring) in meters,
matters become much clearer. I have therefore constructed the map
showing this province ([Map X](#img_map10).md) on the 500 and 5000 meter
contours, with a special shading for one particular area (Tibet) for
reasons that will be explained later (see also [Map
XI](abs16.htm#img_map11).md) . This device brings out at a glance more or
less all that we want to know, and makes it possible to attempt a more
detailed explanation of the more difficult parts. We are now approaching
the summit of our interests and we will have to take our cue from the
mountaineers and initiate what they succinctly refer to as an "attack"
upon the problem. In order to do this we have first to try and sweep
away a whole handful of misconceptions.

The first and most basic of these is to attempt to get rid of

**MAP IX. NORTHERN ORIENTALIA (POLITICAL)**

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

Orientalia is today, from a political point of view, an appalling
hodgepodge. This continent lies to the south of the southeastern end of
Eurasia, all of which is Chinese. (Most countries have for centuries
recognized Tibet as being a part of that hegemony.) To the west, it is
bordered by Iran and Afghanistan, and a thin eastward extension of the
latter separates it from the U.S.S.R. The greater part of it is covered
by India and the two pieces of Pakistan. The eastern half is about
equally divided between southern China proper and eight other sovereign
states—Burma, Thailand, Laos, Viet Min, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaya, and
Indonesia. In addition, there are sundry territories (such as Sarawak)
of other status, and some small colonial possessions. Right in the
middle are the independent kingdom of Nepal, the territory of Sikkim,
and the indeterminate Autonomy of Bhutan. The island of Ceylon is an
independent country; and there are also sundry tiny enclaves, such as
the Portuguese colony of Goa.

</div>

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

the notion that the Orient \[or *Orientalia* as it is better called; see
Chapter 18\], is just a part of Asia. To the contrary, just as what we
call Europe—the boundaries of which have been in dispute throughout
history, and still are—is *not* a separate continent but merely one
large peninsula of a much larger land-mass called Eurasia, so,
conversely is Orientalia not a part of that land-mass but a quite
separate continent. Its climate, past history, geology, and, above all,
its vegetation are quite different from that of Eurasia. Also, it is
almost absolutely separated from Eurasia by a continuous physical
feature that is every bit as divisive as an ocean. This is a tremendous
mountain barrier that runs from Baluchistan in the west to the plains of
Kian-Su in north China in the east. However, here comes the second and
most important point of all.

The mightiest mountain range in the world, the Himalayas, lies well
*south* of this line and is in Orientalia and *not* in Eurasia. Further,
the massif which mounts to the highest peak on land in the world, Mt.
Everest, straddles the division and is north of and *not in the
Himalayas*, as is almost universally supposed. It stands on the equally
vast and high southern rim of Tibet which forms the southern boundary of
Eurasia.

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

Using the 5000-meter contour, we see that between this barrier and the
Himalayas there is really a great gutter at comparatively much lower
level. It is in this gutter that the small state of Nepal lies. Thus,
when we come to the Himalaya province, we must bear in mind that we will
still be in Orientalia, and that we shall continue to be as we approach
Mt. Everest from the south side until we top this Tibetan barrier. This
is frightfully important because the flora and fauna of the
Himalayas—and there is a great deal of vegetative growth forming massed
forests that run up almost to the snow line all over them—is quite
unlike that of Tibet but has relationships with that of the Indo-Chinese
Massif. And this brings us to our third problem.

It will be seen from [Maps X](#img_map10) and [XI](abs16.htm#img_map11.md),
that this Indo-Chinese block terminates abruptly to the north against a
monumental barrier of towering mountain ranges that are confluent with
Tibet. These actually form a small "peninsula" of Eurasia that sticks
down into this part of Orientalia as shown. On an ordinary physical map
it will be seen that the Indo-Chinese block is formed of endless
sub-parallel mountain ranges and strings of ranges, with very narrow
deep valleys between them, running roughly from north to south. These
form fingers going south into the Annams, down central Thailand, and
down the Tenasserim peninsula. There also depends from them the parallel
sub-massif composed of the Naga Hills and the Arakan. In the northwest,
this block is very clearly and widely marked off from the east end of
the Himalayas by a horn of true lowland equatorial forests. This,
contrary to expectation, instead of separating the two upland masses
actually cements them firmly together, from the plant and animal point
of view, for the same forests cover both facing slopes to form a perfect
bridge for both the migrants, emigrants, and immigrants from one side to
the other. To the northeast, affairs are quite different.

Here, there is first, to the north, a small enclave of comparatively
modest uplands running down from the Tibet plateau to the Red Basin of
Szechwan (see [Map X](#img_map10).md). These have a Chinese flora and
fauna. Then, south of these, the Indo-Chinese

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Massif abuts on to
the more modest upland mass of Southern China, from the south of which a
long thin chain of mountains—in Si-Kiang—runs east. This funny little
promontory is rather important because a lot of myth, legend, and
folklore pertaining to ABSMs extends that way. The south China uplands
are of course densely populated and have been for a very long time so
that their vegetative cover is now quite different from that of the
Indo-Chinese Massif. If the two were ever alike is questionable, for the
south China uplands really form quite a separate biotope, or florofaunal
area. The Indo-Chinese province is therefore really rather isolated and
distinct. It is also quite unique in many other ways. Armed with these
facts we may now enter this Indo-Chinese country from the south, and
immediately run into difficulties. This is the country in which the
second largest form of the bovine or ox-cow tribe turned up in 1938—the
Kouprey (*Bos sauveli*)—to the great consternation of established
zoological thinking. It looks like a large edition of the now extinct
Aurochs (*Bos primigenius*) of Europe, with widespreading horns, but the
bulls have large tassels, the strands of which go upward, just short of
the tips of their horns. This was an astonishing discovery in a land
inhabited, and thickly, since most ancient times. Of more interest to
us, however, are the Primates of the area.

These include a lot of strange types. First, it is the headquarters of
the little apes called gibbons, one species of which, the Hoolock
(*Hylobates hooloch*) reaches north and into the Himalayas. Then, there
are also there the Doucs (*Pyagathrix nemaeus* and *nigripes*) which is
one of the most brightly and variegatedly colored of all mammals; and,
the Snub-nosed Monkeys. There are two distinct genera of these, one
found in Tonkin (*Presbytiscus avunculus*); the other being the large
and very extraordinary Rhinopithecus. Of the latter there are three
species: Biet's Monkey (*R. bieti*) from Yunnan which forms a part of
the Indo-Chinese Massif; Brelich's Monkey (*R. brelichi*) a really
enormous form with a large white cape over its shoulders which lives in
the Van Gin Shan mountains in west central China; and the Golden Monkey
(*R. roxellanae*)

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

of the upper end of the Indo-Chinese block and extending up that small
enclave facing the Red Basin mentioned before. This animal is a glowing
metallic gold all over but has a sky-blue face. These monkeys really are
gigantic and look even bigger since they are clothed in long thick fur
that forms a cape.

This is not to say that there are not other monkeys in this province; to
the contrary, there are dozens of Leaf-Monkeys and Langurs, while there
are also lesser Primates. It is, in fact a sort of hotbed of Primates,
in and around which most of the living apes reside, a large proportion
of known fossil Hominids have been found; and quite a "coterie" of
different ABSMs are rumored. Here, what is more, we have a state of
affairs comparable to that which we encountered in Africa, but
compounded, for, in addition to having apes (or Pongids) to contend with
as well as fossil Hominids and alleged ABSMs, we have also lots of large
terrestrial or semi-terrestrial monkeys as well—i.e. the Macaques (which
include the Rhesus) and these Snub-nosed jobs. Nor is that all, for the
local folklore is full of allusions to "men with tails," on the one
hand; and to giant, bipedal monkeys, on the other. This is all very
muddling to the layman but seems also to have thrown the specialists—and
even those few in the field of ABSMery—into confusion. Then lately, the
Chinese have still further muddied the picture by coming up with an
exceedingly ABSM-like race of *people* in Yunnan; while anthropologists
and ethnologists generally have unearthed all kinds of primitive and
most unexpected nations, tribes, and groups in this province.

One of the most extraordinary of these is a group of tribes in the
central mountainous region of this territory, who have very pale
brownish skins, Caucasoid features, and wavy hair. They keep strictly to
themselves and have one curious custom that may be of great significance
to those investigating Malayan folklore where there is said once to have
lived a race of tailed men who had a cutting edge of bone along the
outer (hind) edges of their forearms. These tribesmen possess
practically nothing that is traded from outside but they always

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

carry a large sharp knife of a certain shape; and they always carry this
pointing backward up the arm and with the blade turned outward. With
this they make their way through thick undergrowth at great speed by a
curious down-slashing movement of the arm, so avoiding endless
entanglements with vines by swiping at them.

Straight ABSMery in this province is not extensive until we get to the
extreme northern end of it. In fact it amounts really to some legends
and rumors, except in Yunnan and in northern Burma. Of the first, a
Russian writing in *Tekhnika Molodyzhi* (Vols. 4 and 5, 1959) a science
magazine for the Youth Movement states:

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

In 1954, the Province of Yunnan in China was visited by a representative
of the USSR Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries by the
name of Chekanov. Speaking to Ma-Yao, the assistant chief of the
National Minorities Department of the Kunming City Committee of the
Communist Party of China, he learned that at the beginning of that same
year, 1954, some people had been found in the mountains of Western
Yunnan who in Ma-Yaô s opinion were only at the pre-historic stage of
their development. They led an animal existence, wore no clothes and had
no articulate speech. It seems that Ma-Yao had also mentioned that their
bodies had been covered with hair, and that one of them had been
captured and brought to Kunming.

Chao Kuo-hoi, head teacher of the Yunnan National Minorities Institute
also told Chekanov that the mountains where the people of the Khani
nationality lived in the Hung Ho District were also inhabited by some
strange people who belonged to no nationality whatever, that they wore
no clothes and hid from ordinary people. One of them was captured and
brought to Kunming. When he was dressed in human clothes he seemed quite
satisfied and smiled.

According to what he had heard, Chekanov recalled that this captive wild
man was finally sent to Pekin to be studied by the scientists. All this
evidence, however, stems from people who had only heard about the wild
inhabitants of the mountains from others.

</div>

Of the central area there is not much to be said and actual reports are
neither numerous nor extensive. What there are concern a very large form
of ABSM called locally the *Kung-Lu* or "Mouth-Man." This was first, as
far as I can discover,

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

mentioned by Hassoldt Davis, the well-known American traveler and
author, in his book entitled *Land of the Eye*, which is the account of
the Denis-Roosevelt Asiatic Expedition to Burma, China, India, and the
lost kingdom of Nepal. In this the author says:

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

Jack (John Kenny) was the only one of us who could be called a hunter.
He had shot bear and moose in Maine, and here it was his heart's desire
to try his skill with tiger or Binturong or the Bear Cat (*Artictis*) or
the great rhinoceros which is now found only in this wild corner of
Burma near the Siamese Border. And more exciting even than these was the
report of a creature, the *Kung-Lu* (or Mouth-Man), which had terrified
the people for centuries. The *Kung-Lu*, according to Thunderface, <span
id="fr_31"></span>[\*](#fn_30.md) was a monster that resembled a gorilla, a
miniature King Kong, about 20 feet tall. It lived on the highest
mountains, where its trail of broken trees was often seen, and descended
into the villages only when it wanted meat, human meat. We were told
also that no one in Kensi <span id="fr_32"></span>[†](#fn_31.md) had been
eaten by the *Kung-Lu* for more years than the eldest could remember.

</div>

It is perhaps permissible to speculate on the fact—could it be
coincidence—that Chief Thunderface described a rather typical
*Sasquatch-Oh-Mah* creature? This was my first reaction; and it was a
pretty strong one; but, then, the same thing crops up much more
extensively but with less exaggeration farther north where there are
not, as far as we know, any Amerinds.

There, there is either a similar creature or a closely related one named
the *Tok*, which I am told also means "mouth." My account of this
originally came in the form of a personal communication from a gentleman
who had heard me discussing ABSMs on the air. He gave me the name and
address of a young American, then in the service of his country, who had
been born in the Shan States and brought up there, his

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

parents having been missionaries. In turn, I got in touch with this
young man, whose name I was asked not to publish, and he told me of two
personal encounters—in fact actual physical contacts—with *Toks*, while
he gave me several other reports, and passed me on to others who also in
turn wrote me their stories. All were Americans with much experience of
the country. In the end, it seemed to me that this ABSM may be the same
as the Kung-Lu reported from so much farther south, about which there
is, once again, that most curious detail of all in ABSM reports; namely,
that it, also, attacks *only thin people* and ignores fat ones.

My young American correspondent states that he actually had a *Tok* in
his arms twice and when it broke loose it left handfuls of long, coarse,
shiny black hairs in his hands. The occasions were when it broke into
his family home which was deep in the hill jungles and some distance
from the nearest small, permanent settlement. On both occasions it chose
a bright moonlight night and both times it crashed about apparently
looking for food. Both times the young man tackled it thinking that it
was a native thief or marauder and, being a powerfully built man and an
athlete, and since his parents refused to possess any firearms, he did
so with his bare hands. On each occasion it did not attempt to attack
him in return, but only to flee, and being immensely strong and well
over 6 feet tall it easily broke away, once running straight through a
screen door. As it crossed to the forest in the moonlight, my informant
had a very good look at it. He tells me that it had very wide shoulders,
small head, was covered with jet-black hair, but had straight legs like
a man and very pale soles to its feet. From this correspondent, and some
of those others he put me on to, emerged various local names for this
creature all of which must be translated as "mouth man" or "the man with
the incredibly big mouth."

Hassoldt Davis' *Kung-Lu* is from the southern end of the Indo-Chinese
mountain area, the *Tok* from the northern, where it would seem to merge
with the *Dzu-Teh* of Eastern Tibet (the area that was once called
Sikang) on the one hand, and the *Gin*-*Sung* or Bear-Men of central
China on the

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

other. These areas are all adjacent to the places where the teeth and
bones of *Gigantopithecus* have been unearthed, and if they are all the
same creature, it would bear out Bernard Heuvelmans' theory that they
are indeed *Gigantopithecus*. But we will come to the *Dzu-Teh* and
*Gin-Sung* later. We must now turn aside for a moment to try and clear
up something that is really very puzzling. In doing this, I am going
first to have to jump backward a little and then leap forward right into
the middle of the Himalayas and also into the middle of the
chronological sequence of events there. This I have to do as we will
never make any sense out of the situation in this area unless we get
this sort of "appendage" out of the way.

It begins way down in the plateau of Kontum, in what used to be northern
Indo-China. There, the locals say they have a kind of enormous *monkey*
that walks on its hind legs and which is actually vicious and is quite
willing to attack people. They call it the *Kra-Dhan*. In the
neighboring territory of the Jölong it is called the *Bêć-Boć*
(Bekk-Bok). The mountain people of the south also insist that it is a
*monkey*, and not a man or an ape. This is odd, for there are virtually
tailless monkeys thereabouts, the Stump-tailed Macaques (*Lyssodes*). At
the same time, the locals are equally insistent that these creatures are
not ghosts, departed spirits, demigods, or anything nonmaterial; all of
which, though they often speak of them, they most clearly distinguish
from real physical beings.

There is a report that one of these creatures either committed a murder,
or was responsible for a murder near Konturn in 1943. Unfortunately the
matter was tried by the local native court, of which no records were
sent to the central French authority, while the French Resident of that
area at the time is no longer alive, and the native Commune has been
dispersed since the retirement of the French. This is not by any means
the only report of these *Kra*-*Dhan* to be made to foreigners, and we
have heard of similar entities in areas far to the west of Kontum. There
would be nothing unexpected in reports of an unknown *ape* in this area,
and I

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

personally would not be a bit surprised if someone told me of an alleged
ABSM thereabouts; and for all the same old reasons—ample, unexplored
montane forests; small and isolated human communities; and appropriate
geographical position. But, the insistence on the "monkey" theme is
novel.

Now, as we have said, there have been countless stories throughout the
ages about tailed men. However, I know of only one case of a possible
ABSM ever having been stated to have one. This is one of the most
peculiar of all reports, and is unique in many respects. It happened
right smack in the middle of what has now become virtually traditional
ABSM territory—namely, on the main route to Katmandu, Nepal from the
north. It is alleged to have taken place in June, 1953. Those involved
were two Americans, Dr. George Moore (M.D.) and Dr. George K. Brooks, an
entomologist. The former was Chief of the Public Health Division of the
U.S. Operations Mission, under the Foreign Operations Administration,
and was public health adviser to the Nepalese Government. Dr. Brooks was
on his staff. Dr. Moore had been in the country 2 years. They were
descending the Gosainkund Pass (of some 17,000 feet) on their way back
to Katmandu, the capital, from a trip to the north, and had entered the
upper montane forests, there mostly coniferous, leaving their
pack-carrying porters far behind. There was a thick mist. But it is
better that Dr. Moore tell the incident that then occurred in his own
words. It goes:

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

The forest was deathly still. Fog banks, raw and cold, drifted through
the tall pines and left their boughs dripping and slimy.

Rounding a sharp turn in the trail, Brooks stopped abruptly. He leaned
against a large rock to extract a leech which was on the point of
disappearing over the edge of his boot. I stood there watching Brooks
and fumbling for my pipe when an almost imperceptible movement in a
clump of tall rhododendron caught my eye. Something had moved, I was
sure. There it was again! This time, a few leaves rustled, more than
mere chance could move. Brooks, sensing something was wrong, quickly
forgot about his leech. Almost simultaneously we both slipped our
revolvers out of their holsters. On our right the slope was dangerously
steep. Behind us the slope climbed upward. There was a large boulder by
the side of the

</div>

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

trail and we eased over to it, glad for the protection from the rear it
afforded. We waited, tense and expectant. The stillness was awesome. The
fog and mist seemed to form weird shapes writhing and twisting through
the dense foliage.

Suddenly, from in front of us a raucous scream pierced the air. Another
followed from the right. The ghostly quality of the mist and the
unreality of the situation had a nightmarish tinge.

"God!" Brooks whispered, "what was that?"

My spine was tingling in high gear now. I gripped my .38 S&W more
firmly. About 20 feet away, somewhat in front of our rock, was the clump
of rhododendron where the first scream had come from. We fastened our
gaze on the leaves, trying to peer through them. Another scream broke
the stillness. This time it seemed as though it was behind us.

"Brooks," I managed to whisper, "let's get on this rock in a hurry!"

Brooks did not need a second invitation. In an instant, we had scrambled
on top of the massive boulder. From our new perch, we carefully searched
in all directions for the next move. Our movements must have been
closely watched, for a loud chattering immediately assailed us from the
bushes in front. The angry chatter filled the raw air as new cries
joined in the chorus from all sides. We were definitely surrounded.

Brooks muttered, "Oh my God, how many of them are there? And what are
they?"

We got some idea of what was there when a hideous face thrust apart the
wildly thrashing leaves and gaped at us. It was a face that I shall not
long forget. Grayish skin, beetling black eyebrows, a mouth that seemed
to extend from ear to ear and long, yellowish teeth were shattering
enough. But those eyes … beady, *yellow* eyes that stared at us with
obvious demoniacal cunning and anger. That face! Weird ideas were
beginning to force their way into mind. Perhaps … but no … damn it … it
has to be! This is the Abominable Snowman!

A chill sent gooseflesh along my back. The thought of these creatures
had often been in my mind when we had trekked over the snows and high
place. No European or American had ever proved the existence of the
snowmen, although the natives certainly believed in them. Our boys had
entertained us many an evening around the campfire with horror tales of
the snow beasts, or "*yeti*," as they called them. They told how
solitary travelers had been found torn to bits in the vast reaches of
the mountains; how huge footprints had been found leading away from the
murders. A few Sherpas had even met the monsters face to face and lived
to tell the tale. We considered these accounts unlikely "hill stories,"
although I admit now they had left us somewhat uneasy.

</div>

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

No, I insisted to myself, there is no such creature as an Abominable
Snowman. This face has to be an ape … or a man … or a demon .. or the
SNOWMAN!

A hand pushed through the leaves. Then, a quick movement and a shoulder.
There, before us, appeared the semblance of a body. Sweat was visible on
Brooks' face now as we crouched lower, hugging the rock for what it was
worth. My hands looked white in the semi-darkness.

As the creature emerged through the dark leaves, we strained to make out
his form. I felt blind panic start through me. Then I stopped. "Balls of
fire," I thought, "I've got to get a grip on myself."

The creature was about 5 feet tall, half-crouching on two thin hairy
legs, leering at us in undisguised fury. Claws—or hands—seemed dark,
perhaps black, while his bedraggled, hairy body was gray and thin. It
shuffled along with a stoop the way a neolithic cave man might have
walked. Well-built and sinewy, it could prove to be the most formidable
opponent. Teeth bared, it snarled like an animal. Two long fangs
protruded from its upper lip … Suddenly, a sharp flicking movement
behind it caught our eyes.

"George! A tail! Look there," Brooks cried.

A thousand thoughts raced through my mind at once.

"Well, Brooks," I replied, "this thing could be the Abominable Snowman
but it also could be an ape … a langur ape, perhaps."

Truthfully, I was more concerned with survival than identification. The
band of animals was certainly aggressive, giving every indication that
they meant to destroy us. But I couldn't help thinking about the
creatures themselves. They didn't look like the common langur monkeys
I'd seen in India. At the same time they had apelike characteristics.
Scientific possibilities crowded their way into my mind even as I
checked my revolver for the attack. Higher altitudes, less minerals in
the water could produce less hair. Lack of heavy timber in the high
regions, which would make climbing ability relatively valueless, could
produce an erect species. Mutations—the methods by which new species are
created—have occurred, and are constantly observable in laboratories.
Variations within a single species over a period of time can produce
animals greatly different from the parent strain. I had no time to share
these thoughts with Brooks. The best I could mumble was an unsteady,
"Get ready."

Other figures were approaching now from several directions. We could
make out 6 or 7 of them through the mist. One appeared to be carrying a
baby around its neck. They seemed to mean business as they growled at
each other. The one that had pushed through the foliage first was the
leader. There was little question as to his authority as he led the
attack.

</div>

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Geneva, sans-serif">

"Brooks," I said hurriedly, "let's try firing over their heads to see if
we can scare them. Don't hit them, for heaven's sake, or we may have
them in a frenzy. A wounded animal—if they are animals—won't stop. And
if they are demons, the Sherpas will never forgive us if we kill them.
The Sherpas, superstitious as they are, would rather be killed than
offend their gods, especially here."

"Okay, George, you say when," he replied softly.

We sighted carefully through the fog and waited until the repulsive
faces were about 10 feet away. We squeezed the triggers almost together.
The blast swirled the fog in front of us. Splinters of wood and torn
leaves fell through the foliage. The creatures stopped abruptly.

</div>

The original account, which appeared in the magazine *Sports Afield*,
May, 1957, concludes with quite a long passage relating the purely human
reactions on the part of the author, his companion, and their Sherpa
porters. It is indicated that the latter seem to have assumed that they
had met some *Yetis*—the general Nepalese term now used by the Press—and
they were greatly relieved that their employers had not been harmed.
However, they did not resort to any exaggerated expressions and, it
seems to me at least, they were singularly lacking in observations of
any kind. In fact, I have an impression that they were somewhat
mystified, and perhaps even unbelieving, but too polite to so comment.
The account and the locale do not jibe with anything said by any natives
of ABSMs on either count.

This is one of the most factual reports we have of anything \[be it of
ABSMs or not\] to come out of Nepal as we shall most abundantly see in
the next chapter. Moreover, it was made by a highly trained medical man,
a person of all classes of educated men least likely to panic in face of
bodily abnormality, and who must also have had some training in
comparative anatomy if nothing else. Also, it occurred at less than
11,000 feet so that there cannot be any accusation of mental fatigue
producing illusions that *can* be brought on by very high altitude and
rarefied air if one is not acclimatized to them. In addition, the teller
had a witness of equally high mental caliber and training. Moreover, if
they had wanted to turn the creatures they saw into the traditional
"abominable snowman,"

\[of the giant or *Dzu-Teh*, the bestial or *Meh-Teh*, or even of the
little forest *Teh-lma*, variety\] they could quite well have done so,
simply by neglecting to mention the tails. Tails just don't fit onto
ABSMs.

There are also some extremely pertinent remarks in this account that
have not, as far as I know, been commented upon nor even perhaps
noticed. The first, is the very definite statement that their eyes were
bright *yellow*. Not much is known or recorded about the color of wild
animals' eyes, and quite a number of the stuffed specimens in our great
museums have completely the wrong colored irises. One of my duties when
I was a collector was to record the colors of the eyes of the animals.
No ape has a yellow eye: they all have dark brown eyes; though I have
seen an abnormal chimp with pale gray eyes. Many monkeys, on the other
hand, do have bright yellow eyes—in fact, this color is rather common
among them and it seems to go with lighter coat color. Some of the
Langurs have yellow eyes, as do also at least two of their African
relatives among the Mangabeys (*Cercocebus*) .

Pertinent to this story also, is that I was once "attacked" by a large
band of Red-topped Mangabeys (*C. torquatus*), in a mist, on the ground,
in an upper montane forest, in West Africa. I say "attacked" advisedly
because they ran at me threateningly—and particularly the big males, one
of which I was forced to kill and which proved to be the all-time record
in length for that species \[its skin and skull are in the British
Museum\]. As I could not run away \[which I admit is my natural instinct
and invariable practice in face of any such danger\], due to the density
of the lower-level forest growth under which I had to wriggle along on
my stomach, it was manifest that this action was not concerted or
carried through. The one I shot did come most alarmingly close and was
screaming and grimacing at me, and showing its very long yellow fanglike
canine teeth. When it stood up on its hind legs, it seemed almost to be
looking at me eye for eye, and I thought it was actually going to jump
me. When I shot it, the others just renewed their howling, and they kept
this up for about 10 minutes while rushing at me in simulated onslaught.
Eventually

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I just went away,
backward on my stomach, and left them.

Another point that Dr. Moore makes is the thinness of the animals' legs.
This is a monkey feature, as is also the slimness of their bodies when
they stand up. But most significant of all is that he says that "One
appeared to be carrying a baby around its neck." This is an odd one.
Young baboons and macaques at first hang under their mothers'
bodies—they being quadrupedal—but they later ride astride their mothers'
hind backs, holding on to her back fur. Almost all other monkeys carry
their young in their crooked forearms or in one arm, but some of the
Lutongs (*Trachypithecus*) —very near relatives of the Langurs or
Semnopithecines—wrap them around their necks like feather boas or mink
scarfs, *and especially* when they descend to the ground.

The whole attitude of the creatures in this story seems, indeed, to
savor much more of a kind of monkey than of an ape or sub-hominid. As of
now, I class them as such, but with reservations. Yet, monkey or not, I
feel that the report is the truth and that we have therefore to be
keenly on the lookout for the interjection of "evidence" presented for
the existence of some ABSMs in this area being the result of the
existence of giant monkeys. It is clearly manifest that these creatures,
and such as the *Kra*-*Dhan*, actually have nothing to do with ABSMs.
They, like the local bears, are just another side issue, and a
complication. And this brings up the next of our problems in this
mixed-up area. This is the *known* fauna. The trouble here is that none
of the people who have been to the Himalayas seem ever to have known
anything of what *is* known of the mammalian fauna of the region, while
most of those who really do know that fauna are few and far between;
either in museums or zoos in Europe or America, and almost none have
ever been near the Himalayas. There is thus a most appalling muddle as
to just what mammals do live there and which don't.

The worst confusion is over the bears. There are representatives of
three genera of bears actually known to live in the Himalayas—the
Himalayan or Moon Bear (*Selenarctos*), black with a white V-collar; the
Sloth-Bear (*Melursus*), a

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

strange aberrant type with a long nose, which eats mostly insects and
honey; and the Brown or Dish-faced Bears (*Ursus*). Of the last, three
species, sub-species, or races distinguished by color, have been
recorded. These have been called the Red Bear, the Blue Bear, and the
Isabelline Bear. There is an appalling muddle over the scientific names
of these, apart from the Red Bear, which everybody agrees is not red and
is simply a local variety of *Ursus arctos*, the Brown Bear of the rest
of Eurasia. There is a name, *Ursus isabellinus*, which was once
bestowed upon an almost white specimen of Brown Bear from the Karakoram,
but which was jauntily and popularly called the "Snow Bear." Later,
bluish-gray pelted specimens appeared from other localities and were
either so called, or named *Ursus pruinosus* or *Ursus arctos
pruinosus*. Some were creamy, others almost white, but most were gray.
Nobody today is prepared or can say just how many races of Brown Bears
there are in the Himalaya range of mountains, nor what their exact
ranges are; whether they are full species, sub-species, or merely races;
nor even whether they breed true. In other words, this "Isabelline Bear"
is a lovely bogey to be waved at people who are not only not specialists
in zoology, but particularly not specialists in mammals—and Oriental
mammals at that! In my opinion the thing is a myth, just like our North
American so-called "Grizzly Bear" which is and can be any Dish-faced
Bear \[as opposed to one of our Black Bears\] that happens to have a
grizzled pelage. One almost white specimen of a bear was killed in
Tibet, and immediately called an Isabelline Bear but turned out to be an
albino Himalayan Black (*Selenarctos*) not a Brown Bear (*Ursus*) at
all.

But this is not all. While most bears can stand up on their hind legs
for brief periods and can wobble along for a short distance on two legs,
they happen to have a certain most peculiar feature. This has already
been most ably demonstrated by Dr. Bernard Heuvelmans, and is that all
bears are pigeon-toed and thus leave tracks that look as if they were
bipedal, but walked with their feet put on backward. The toes point a
little inward, the heels outward; in men, it is the other way, except
for the Amerinds and some others who often walk

The eastern half of Orientalia is also enormously complex from the
topographical and phytogeographical points of view. Its central core is
the huge Indochinese Peninsula—a vast mass of mountain ranges running
from north to south—that lies between the Indian and the Chinese
lowlands. This abuts southward onto a vast lowland which constitutes
Thailand. From this depends the Malay Peninsula. Around it lie a diadem
of islands, starting with the Andamans and Nicobars in the Bay of Bengal
on the west; encompassing the greater Indonesian islands of Sumatra,
Java, and Borneo on the south; and continuing on via Palawan to the
Philippines and Formosa (Taiwan) on the east. Between and among these
are literally hundreds of thousands of other smaller islands; plus
another string along the coast, terminating in Hainan. The southeastern
end of the continent is "Wallace's Line"—running between the
Philippines, Borneo, and Java on the one hand, and the Celebes and the
Australoid islands on the other.

absolutely straight ahead. Apart from this, nobody, and least of all a
"native," could ever mistake a bear's track, or print, for that of a
man, and even more especially that of an "abominable snowman." In bears,
the middle toe is the longest, the *outer* one the largest; they leave
claw marks in any material into which they sink lower than the hairline
on their feet. Finally, they cannot go on their hind legs on anything
but level, unencumbered ground, and even then, only for short distances.
Bear tracks have been mistaken for ABSM tracks *but* ABSM tracks have
never been mistaken for bear tracks. Bears as an explanation of ABSM
tracks, have also been brought up in North, Central, and South America,
and in Malaya and Sumatra where species of bears do exist. However, they
have not, of course, been able to be used in Ethiopian Africa where this
group of animals has never been found or reported. (See Appendix B for
tracks.) When it comes to animals that could possibly be the origin of
Himalayan ABSM reports, the bears are not alone. However, all other
kinds of animals so far suggested as being the true origin of ABSMs are
absolutely ridiculous. Several have been suggested, such as Langur
Monkeys of the species *Semnopithecus* *entellus*, which happens to be a
purely Indian form, the Giant Panda,

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

wolves, the snow-leopard, and even large birds! But when it comes to
candidates for scalps and hairs, the list is very much greater. \[I
append a list of the larger mammals found in that area and in Tibet as
Appendix D.\]

In leaving the Indo-Chinese province we omitted to stress one point;
this was, simply, that its northern part is a meeting place of three
outstanding ABSM areas. Each of these appear to have different
indigenous kinds. These are of the usual four main forms—namely, a
giant, a *Meh-Teh*, a human type, and a pigmy. There is evidence of a
very manlike, man-sized one in the south, as we have seen (*vide*: in
Malaya); to the north in the eastern end of Tibet and the eastern
Eurasian area generally there is a very large one, the *Dzu-Teh*, *Tok*,
*Kung-Lu*, or bearlike *Gin-Sung*, Mountain Man of the Chinese; in the
west \[that is to say in the Himalayas themselves\] there are two kinds;
first there is the little 4-foot tall *Teh-lma* of the lower montane
forests; and secondly, the heavy-set *Meh-Teh* (the original Abominable
Snowman) with a conical head, and very large and widely separated first
*and* second toes, which often treks over snow-covered passes from one
valley to another. The giant, with almost human-type feet, is *not*
found in the Himalayas nor along the Tibetan barrier but is confined to
the mountains between Tibet, China, and Burma.
