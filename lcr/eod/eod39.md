*Evolution of the Dragon*, by G. Elliot Smith, \[1919\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

#### ARTEMIS AND THE GUARDIAN OF THE PORTAL.

Sir Gardner Wilkinson states (see text-figure, [p.
179](eod38.htm#page_179), *b*.md) that "a basket of sycamore figs" was
originally the hieroglyphic sign for a woman, a goddess, or a mother.
Later on ([p. 199](eod40.htm#page_199).md) I shall refer to the possible
bearing of this Egyptian idea upon the origin of the Hebrew word for
mandrakes and the allusion to "a basket of figs" in the Book of
Jeremiah.

The life-giving powers attributed to "love-apples" and the association
of these ideas with the fig-tree may have facilitated the transference
of these attributes of "apples" to those actually growing upon a tree.

We know that Aphrodite was intimately associated, not only with
"love-apples," but also with real apples. The sun-god Apollo's connexion
with the apple-tree, which Dr. Rendel Harris, with great daring, wants
to convert into an identity of name, was probably only one of the
results of that long series of confusions between the Great

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mother (Hathor)
and the Sun-god (Horus), to which I have referred in my discussion of
the dragon-story.

But when Apollo's form emerges more clearly he is associated not with
Aphrodite but with Artemis, whom Dr. Rendel Harris has shown to be
identified with the mugwort, *Artemisia*. The association of the goddess
with this plant is probably related to the identification of Sekhet with
the marsh-plants of the Egyptian Delta and of Hathor and Isis with the
lotus and other water plants. Any doubt as to the reality of these
associations and Egyptian connexions is banished by the evidence of
Artemis's male counterpart Apollo Hyakinthos and his relations to the
sacred lily and other water plants. <span
id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_337.md) Artemis was a gynæcological specialist:
for she assisted women not only in childbirth and the expulsion of the
placenta, but also in cases of amenorrhœa and affections of the uterus.
She was regarded as the goddess of the portal, not merely of
birth, <span id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_338.md) but also of gold and
treasure, of which she possessed the key, and of the year (January).

This brings us back to the guardianship of gold and treasures which
plays so vital a part in the evolution of the Mediterranean goddesses.
For, like the story of the dog and the mandrake, it emphasizes the
conchological ancestry of these deities and their connexion with the
guardians of the subterranean palaces where pearls are found. But
Artemis was not only the opener of the treasure-houses, but she also
possessed the secret of the philosopher's stone: she could transmute
base substances into gold, <span id="fr_339"></span>[3](#fn_339.md) for was
she not the offspring of the Golden Hathor? To open the portal either of
birth or wealth she used her magic wand or key. As *Nūb*, the lady of
gold, the Great Mother could not only change other substances into gold,
but she was also the guardian of the treasure house of gold, pearls, and
precious stones. Hence she could grant riches. Elsewhere in this chapter
([p. 221](eod43.htm#page_221).md) I shall explain how the goddess came to
be identified with gold.

Just as Hathor, the Eye of Re, descended to provide the elixir of youth
for the king who was the sun-god, so Artemis is described as

travelling through the air in a car drawn by two serpents <span

Artemis was a moon-goddess closely related to Britomartis and Diktynna,
the Cretan prototype of Aphrodite. These goddesses afforded help to
women in childbirth and were regarded as guardians of the portal. The
goddess of streams and marshes was identified with the mugwort
(*Artemisia*), which was hung above the door in the place occupied at
other times by the winged disk, the thunder-stone, or a crocodile
(dragon). As the guardian of portals Artemis's magic plant could open
locks and doors. As the giver of life she could also withhold the vital
essence and so cause disease or death; but she possessed the means of
curing the ills she inflicted. Artemis, in fact, like all the other
goddesses, was a witch.

In former lectures <span id="fr_342"></span>[3](#fn_342.md) I have often
discussed the remarkable feature of Egyptian architecture, which is
displayed in the tendency to exaggerate the door-posts and lintels,
until in the New Empire the great temples become transformed into little
more than monstrously overgrown doorways or pylons. I need not emphasize
again the profound influence exerted by this line of development upon
the Dravidian temples of India and the symbolic gateways of China and
Japan.

This significance of gates was no doubt suggested by the idea that they
represented the means of communication between the living and the dead,
and, symbolically, the portal by which the dead acquired a rebirth into
a new form of existence. It was presumably for this reason that the
winged disk as a symbol of life-giving, was placed above the lintels of
these doors, not merely in Egypt, Phœnicia, the Mediterranean Area, and
Western Asia, but also in America, <span id="fr_343"></span>[4](#fn_343.md)
and in modified forms in India, Indonesia, Melanesia, Cambodia, China,
and Japan.

The discussion (Chapter II) of the means by which the winged disk came
to acquire the power of life-giving, "the healing in its wings," will
have made it clear that the sun became accredited with these virtues
only when it assumed the place of the other "Eye of Re," the Great
Mother. In fact, it was a not uncommon practice in Egypt

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

to represent the eyes of Re or of Horus himself in place of the more
usual winged disk. In the Ægean area the original practice of
representing the Great Mother was retained long after it was superseded
in Egypt by the use of the winged disk (the sun-god).

Over the lintel of the famous "Lion Gate" at Mycenæ, instead of the
winged disk, we find a vertical pillar to represent the Mother Goddess,
flanked by two lions which are nothing more than other representatives
of herself ([Fig. 26](#img_fig26).md).

In his "Mycenæan Tree and Pillar Cult," Sir Arthur Evans has shown that
all possible transitional forms can be found (in Crete and the Ægean
area) between the representation of the actual goddess and her pillar-
and tree-manifestations, until the stage is reached where the sun itself
appears above the pillar between the lions. <span
id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_344.md) In the large series of seals from
Mesopotamia and Western Asia which have been described in Mr. William
Hayes Ward's monograph, <span id="fr_345"></span>[2](#fn_345.md) we find
manifold links between both the Egyptian and the Minoan cults.

The tree-form of the Great Mother there becomes transformed into the
"tree of life" and the winged disk is perched upon its summit. Thus we
have a duplication of the life-giving deities. The "tree of life" of the
Great Mother surmounted by the winged disk which is really her surrogate
or that of the sun-god, who took over from her the power of life-giving
(Figs. [25](#img_fig25) and [26](#img_fig26).md).

In an interesting Cretan sarcophagus from Hagia Triada <span
id="fr_346"></span>[3](#fn_346.md) the life-giving power is *tripled*.
There is not only the tree representing the Great Mother herself; but
also the double axe (the winged-disk homologue of the sun-god); and the
more direct representation of him as a bird perched upon the axe ([Fig.
25](#img_fig25), *f*.md).

The identification of the Great Mother with the tree or pillar seems
also to have led to her confusion with the pestle with which the
materials for her draught of immortality was pounded. She was also the
bowl or mortar in which the pestle worked. <span
id="fr_347"></span>[4](#fn_347.md)

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

As the Great Mother became confused with the pestle, so, "the
Soma-plant, whose stalks are crushed by the priests to make the
Soma-libation, becomes in the Vedas itself the Crusher or Smiter, by a
very characteristic and frequent Oriental conceit in accordance with
which the agent and the person or thing acted on are identified". <span
id="fr_348"></span>[1](#fn_348.md)

"The pressing-stones by means of which Soma is crushed typify
thunderbolts." "In the *Rig-Veda*, we read of him \[Soma\] as
*jyotih-rathah*, *i.e.* 'mounted on a car of light' (IX, 5, 86, verse
43); or again: 'Like a hero he holds weapons in his hand … mounted on a
chariot' (IX, 4, 76, verse 2)"—(p. 171).

"Soma was the giver of power, of riches and treasures, flocks and herds,
but above all, the giver of immortality" (p. 140).

Sir Arthur Evans is of opinion "that in the case of the Cypriote
cylinders the attendant monsters and, to a certain extent, the symbolic
column itself, are taken from an Egyptian solar cycle, and the inference
has been drawn that the aniconic pillars among the Mycenæans of Cyprus
were identified with divinities having some points in common with the
sun-gods Ra, or Horus, and Hathor, the Great Mother" (*op. cit.*, pp. 63
and 64).

In attempting to find some explanation of how the tree or pillar of the
goddess came to be replaced in the Indian legend by Mount Meru, the
possibility suggests itself whether the aniconic form of the Great
Mother placed between two relatively diminutive hills may not have
helped, by confusion, to convert the cone itself into a yet bigger hill,
which was identified with Mount Meru, the summit of which in other
legends produced the *amrita* of the gods, either in the form of the
soma plant that grew upon its heights, or the rain clouds which
collected there. But, as the subsequent argument will make clear, the
real reason for the identification of the Great Mother with a mountain
was the belief that the sun was born from the splitting of the eastern
mountain, which thus assumed the function of the sun-god's mother.
Possibly the association of the tops of mountains with cloud-and
rain-phenomena and the gods that controlled them played some part in the

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

development of the symbolism of mountains. \[When I referred (in Chapter
II, [p. 98](eod22.htm#page_98).md) to the fact that what Sir Arthur Evans
calls "the horns of consecration" was primarily the split mountain of
the dawn, I was not aware that Professor Newberry ("Two Cults of the Old
Kingdom," Annals of *Archæology and Anthropology*, Liverpool, Vol. I,
1908, p. 28) had already suggested this identification.\]

In the Egyptian story the god Re instructed the Sekti of Heliopolis to
pound the materials for the food of immortality. In the Indian version,
the gods, aware of their mortality, desired to discover some elixir
which would make them immortal. To this end, Mount Meru \[the Great
Mother\] was cast into the sea \[of milk\]. Vishnu, in his second
*avatar* as a tortoise <span id="fr_349"></span>[1](#fn_349.md) supported
the mountain on his back; and the Nâga serpent Vasuki was then twisted
around the mountain, the gods seizing its head and the demons his tail
twirled the mountain until they had churned the amrita or water of life.
Wilfrid Jackson has called attention to the fact that this scene has
been depicted, not only in India and Japan, but also in the Precolumbian
*Codex Cortes* drawn by some Maya artist in Central America. <span
id="fr_350"></span>[2](#fn_350.md)

The horizon is the birthplace of the gods; and the birth of the deity is
depicted with literal crudity as an emergence from the portal between
its two mountains. The mountain splits to give birth to the sun-god,
just as in the later fable the parturient mountain produced the
"ridiculous mouse" (Apollo Smintheus). The Great Mother is described as
giving birth—"the gates of the firmament are undone for Teti himself at
break of day" \[that is when the sun-god is born on the horizon\]. "He
comes forth from the Field of Earu" (Egyptian Pyramid Texts—Breasted's
translation).

In the domain of Olympian obstetrics the analogy between birth and the
emergence from the door of a house or the gateway of a temple is a
common theme of veiled reference. Artemis, for instance, is a goddess of
the portal, and is not only a helper in childbirth, but also grows in
her garden a magical herb which is capable of opening locks. This
reputation, however, was acquired not merely by reason of her skill in
midwifery, but also as an outcome of the legend <span
id="fr_351"></span>[3](#fn_351.md) of the treasure-house of pearls which
was under the guardianship of the great “giver

(*a*) An Egyptian picture of Hathor between the mountains of the horizon
(on which trees are growing) (after Budge, "Gods of the Egyptians," Vol.
II, p. 101). \[This is a part only of a scene in which the goddess Nut
is giving birth to the sun, whose rays illuminate Hathor on the horizon,
as Sothis, the "Opener of the Way" for the sun.\]

(*b*) The mountains of the horizon supporting a cow's head as a
surrogate of Hathor, from a stele found at Teima in Northern Arabia, now
in the Louvre (after Sir Arthur Evans, *op. cit.*, p. 39). This
indicates the identity of what Evans calls "the horns of consecration"
and the "mountains of the horizon," and also suggests how confusion may
have arisen between the mountains and the cow's horns.

(*c*) The Mesopotamian sun-god Shamash rising between the Eastern
Mountains, the Gates of Dawn (Ward, *op. cit.*, p. 373).

(*d*) The familiar Egyptian representation of the sun rising between the
Eastern Mountains (the splitting of the mountain giving birth to "the
ridiculous mouse"—Smintheus). The *ankh* (life-sign) below the sun is
the determinative of the act of giving birth or life. The design is
heraldically supported by the Great Mother's lionesses.

(*e*) Part of the design from a Mycenæan vase from Old Salamis (after
Evans, p. 9). The cow's head and the Eastern Mountains are shown
alongside one another, each of them supporting the Double Axe
representing the god.

(*f*) Part of the design from a lentoid gem from the Idæan Cave, now in
the Candia Museum (after Evans, Fig. 25). If this design be compared
with the Egyptian picture (*a*), it will be seen that Hathor's place is
taken by the tree-form of the Great Mother, and the trees which in the
former (*a*) are growing upon the Eastern Mountains are now placed
alongside the "horns". In the complete design (*vide* Evans, *op. cit.*,
p. 44) a votary is represented blowing a conch-shell trumpet to animate
the deity in the sacred tree.

(*g*) The Eastern Mountains supporting the pillar-form of the goddess
(after Evans, Fig. 66).

(*h*) Another Mycenæan design comparable with (*e*).

(*l*) Design from a signet-ring from Mycenæ (after Evans, Fig. 34). If
this be compared with the Egyptian picture (*a*) it will be noted that
the Great Mother is now replaced by a tree: the Eastern Mountains by
bulls, from whose backs the trees of the Eastern Mountains are
sprouting. This design affords interesting corroboration of the
suggestion that the Eastern Mountains may be confused with the cow's
head (see *b* and *e*) or with the cow itself. Newberry (*Annals of
Archæology and Anthropology*, Liverpool, Vol. I, p. 28) has called
attention to the intimate association (in Protodynastic Egypt) of the
Eastern Mountains, the Bull and the Double Axe—a certain token of
cultural contact with Crete.

(*k*) The famous sculpture above the Lion Gate at Mycenæ. The pillar
form of the Great Mother heraldically supported by her
lioness-*avatars*, which correspond to the cattle of the design (1) and
the Eastern Mountains of (*a*). The use of this design above the lintel
of the gate brings it into homology with the Winged Disk. The Pillar
represents the Goddess, as the Disk represents her Egyptian locum
tenens, Horus; her destructive representatives (the lionesses)
correspond to the two uræi of the Winged Disk design.

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

of life” and of which she kept the magic key. She was in fact the
feminine form of Janus, the doorkeeper who presided over all beginnings,
whether of birth, or of any kind of enterprise or new venture, or the
commencement of the year (like Hathor). Janus was the guardian of the
door of Olympus itself, the gate of rebirth into the immortality of the
gods.

The ideas underlying these conceptions found expression in an endless
variety of forms, material, intellectual, and moral, wherever the
influence of civilization made itself felt. I shall refer only to one
group of these expressions that is directly relevant to the
subject-matter of this book. I mean the custom of suspending or
representing the life-giving symbol above the portal of temples and
houses. Thus the plant peculiar to Artemis herself, the mugwort or
Artemisia, was hung above the door, <span
id="fr_352"></span>[1](#fn_352.md) just as the winged disk was sculptured
upon the lintel, or the thunder-stone was placed above the door of the
cowhouse <span id="fr_353"></span>[2](#fn_353.md) to afford the protection
of the Great Mother's powers of life-giving to her own cattle.

In the Pyramid Texts the rebirth of a dead pharaoh is described with
vivid realism and directness. "The waters of life which are in the sky
come. The waters of life which are in the earth come. The sky burns for
thee, the earth trembles for thee, before the birth of the god. The two
hills are divided, the god comes into being, the god takes possession of
his body. The two hills are divided, this Neferkere comes into being,
this Neferkere takes possession of his body. Behold this Neferkere—his
feet are kissed by the pure waters which are from Atum, which the
phallus of Shu made, which the vulva of Tefnut brought into being. They
have come, they have brought for thee the pure waters from their
father." <span id="fr_354"></span>[3](#fn_354.md)

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

The Egyptians entertained the belief <span
id="fr_355"></span>[1](#fn_355.md) that the sun-god was born of the
celestial cow Mehetwēret, a name which means "Great Flood," and is the
equivalent of the primeval ocean Nun. In other words the celestial cow
Hathor, the embodiment of the life-giving waters of heaven and earth, is
the mother of Horus. So also Aphrodite was born of the "Great Flood"
which is the ocean.

In his report upon the hieroglyphs of Beni Hasan, <span
id="fr_356"></span>[2](#fn_356.md) Mr. Griffith refers to the picture of "a
woman of the marshes," which is read *sekht*, and is "used to denote the
goddess Sekhet, the goddess of the marshes, who presided over the
occupations of the dwellers there. Chief among these occupations must
have been the capture of fish and fowl and the culture and gathering of
water-plants, especially the papyrus and the lotus". Sekhet was in fact
a rude prototype of Artemis in the character depicted by Dr. Rendel
Harris." <span id="fr_357"></span>[3](#fn_357.md)

It is perhaps not without significance that the root of a marsh plant,
the *Iris pseudacorus* <span id="fr_358"></span>[4](#fn_358.md) is regarded
in Germany as a luck-bringer which can take the place of the
mandrake. <span id="fr_359"></span>[5](#fn_359.md)

The Great Mother wields a magic wand which the ancient Egyptian scribes
called the "Great Magician". It was endowed with the two-fold powers of
life-giving and opening, which from the beginning were intimately
associated the one with the other from the analogy of the act of birth,
which was both an opening and a giving of life. Hence the "magic wand"
was a key or "opener of the ways," wherewith; at the ceremonies of
resurrection, the mouth was opened for speech and the taking of food, as
well as for the passage of the breath of life, the eyes were opened for
sight, and the ears for hearing. Both the physical act of opening (the
"key" aspect) as well as the vital aspect of life-giving (which we may
call the "uterine" aspect) were implied in this symbolism. Mr. Griffith
suggests that the form of the magic wand may have been derived from that
of a conventionalized

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

picture of the uterus, <span id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_360.md) in its
aspect as a giver of life. But it is possible also that its other
significance as an "opener of the ways" may have helped in the confusion
of the hieroglyphic uterus-symbol with the key-symbol, and possibly also
with double-axe symbol which the vaguely defined early Cretan
Mother-Goddess wielded. For, as we have already seen (*supra*, [p.
122](eod25.htm#page_122).md), the axe also was a life-giving divinity and a
magic wand ([fig. 8](#img_19100).md).

In his chapter on "the Origin of the Cult of Artemis," Dr. Rendel Harris
refers to the reputation of Artemis as the patron of travellers, and to
Parkinson's statement: "It is said of Pliny that if a traveller binde
some of the hearbe \[Artemisia\] with him, he shall feele no weariness
at all in his journey" (p. 72). Hence the high Dutch name *Beifuss* is
applied to it.

<span id="img_19100"></span> ![Fig. 8.](img/19100.jpg.md)

(*a*) "Ceremonial forked object," or "magic wand," used in the ceremony
of "opening the mouth," possibly connected with (*b*) (a bicornuate
uterus), according to Griffith ("Hieroglyphics," p. 60).

(*c*) The Egyptian sign for a key.

(*d*) The double axe of Crete and Egypt.

The left foot of the dead was called "the staff of Hathor" by the
Egyptians; and the goddess was said "to make the deceased's legs to
walk". <span id="fr_361"></span>[2](#fn_361.md)

It was a common practice to tie flowers to a mummy's feet, as I
discovered in unwrapping the royal mummies. According to Moret (*op.
cit.*) the flowers of Upper and Lower Egypt were tied under the king's
feet at the celebration of the Sed festival.

Mr. Battiscombe Gunn (quoted by Dr. Alan Gardiner) states that the
familiar symbol of life known as the *ankh* represents the string of a
sandal. <span id="fr_362"></span>[3](#fn_362.md)

It seems to be worth considering whether the symbolism of the
sandal-string may not have been derived from the life-girdle, which in

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

ancient Indian medical treatises was linked in name with the female
organs of reproduction and the pubic bones. According to Moret (*op.
cit.*, p. 91) a girdle furnished with a tail was used as a sign of
consecration or attainment of the divine life after death. Jung (*op.
cit.*, p. 270), who, however, tries to find a phallic meaning in all
symbolism, claims that reference to the foot has such a significance.

Ascent of Olympus," p. 80. In the building up of the idea of rebirth the
ancients kept constantly before their minds a very concrete picture of
the actual process of parturition and of the anatomy of the organs
concerned in this physiological process. This is not the place to enter
into a discussion of the anatomical facts represented in the symbolism
of the "giver of life" presiding over the portal and the "two hills"
which are divided at the birth of the deity: but the real significance
of the primitive imagery cannot be wholly ignored if we want to
understand the meaning of the phraseology used by the ancient writers.
