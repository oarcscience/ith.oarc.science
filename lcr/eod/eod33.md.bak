#### THE ORIGIN OF CLOTHING.

The cowry and its surrogates were supposed to be potent to confer
fertility on maidens; and it became the practice for growing girls to
wear a girdle on which to suspend the shells as near as possible to the
organ their magic was supposed to stimulate. Among many peoples <span
id="fr_263"></span>[2](#fn_263.md) this girdle was discarded as soon as the
girls reached maturity.

This practice probably represents the beginning of the history of
clothing; but it had other far-reaching effects in the domain of belief.

It has often been claimed that the feeling of modesty was not the reason
for the invention of clothing, but that the clothes begat modesty. <span
id="fr_264"></span>[3](#fn_264.md) This doctrine contains a certain element
of truth, but is by no means the whole explanation. For true modesty is
displayed by people who have never worn clothes.

Before mankind could appreciate the psychological fact that the wearing
of clothing might add to an individual's allurement and enhance her
sexual attractiveness, some other circumstances must have been
responsible for suggesting the experiments out of which this empirical
knowledge emerged. The use of a girdle (*a*) as a protection against
danger to life, and (I) as a means of conferring fecundity on

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

girls <span id="fr_265"></span>[1](#fn_265.md) provided the circumstances
which enabled men to discover that the sexual attractiveness of maidens,
which in a state of nature was originally associated with modesty and
coyness, was profoundly intensified by the artifices of clothing and
adornment.

Among people (such as those of East Africa and Southern Arabia) in which
it was customary for unmarried girls to adorn themselves with a girdle,
it is easy to understand how the meaning of the practice underwent a
change, and developed into a device for enhancing their charms and
stimulating the imaginations of their suitors. Out of such experience
developed the idea of the magical girdle as an allurement and a
love-provoking charm or philtre. Thus Aphrodite's girdle acquired the
reputation of being able to *compel* love. When Ishtar removed her
girdle in the under-world reproduction ceased in the world. The Teutonic
Brunhild's great strength lay in her girdle. In fact magic virtues were
conferred upon most goddesses in every part of the world by means of a
cestus of some sort. <span id="fr_266"></span>[2](#fn_266.md) But the
outstanding

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

feature of Aphrodite's character as a goddess of love is intimately
bound up with these conceptions which developed from the wearing of a
girdle of cowries.

In the Biblical narrative, after Adam and Eve had eaten the forbidden
fruit, "the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were
naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons,"
or, as the Revised Version expresses it, "girdles". The girdle of
fig-leaves, however, was originally a surrogate of the

<span id="img_15500"></span> ![FIG. 4.TWO REPRESENTATIONS OF ASTARTE
(QETESH).](img/15500.jpg.md)

(*a*) The mother-goddess standing upon a lioness (which is her Sekhet
form): she is wearing her girdle, and upon her head is the moon and the
cow's horns, conventionalized so as to simulate the crescent moon. Her
hair is represented in the conventional form which is sometimes used as
Hathor's symbol. In her hands are the serpent and the lotus, which again
are merely forms of the goddess herself.

(*b*) Another picture of Astarte (from Roscher's "Lexikon") holding the
papyrus sceptre which at times is regarded as an animate form of the
mother-goddess herself and as such a thunder weapon.

girdle of cowries: it was an amulet to give fertility. The consciousness
of nakedness was part of the knowledge acquired as *the result* of the
wearing of such girdles (and the clothing into which they developed),
and was not originally the motive that impelled our remote ancestors to
clothe themselves.

The use of fig-leaves for the girdle in Palestine is an interesting
connecting link between the employment of the cowry and the mandrake for
similar purposes in the neighbourhood of the Red Sea and in Cyprus and
Syria respectively (*vide infra*).

In Greece and Italy, the sweet basil has a reputation for magical

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

properties analogous to those of the cowry. Maidens collect the plant
and wear bunches of it upon their body or upon their girdles; while
married women fix basil upon their heads. <span
id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_267.md) It is believed that the odour of the
plant will attract admirers: hence in Italy it is called *Bacia-nicola*,
"Kiss me, Nicholas". <span id="fr_268"></span>[2](#fn_268.md)

In Crete it is a sign of mourning presumably because its life-prolonging
attributes, as a means of conferring continued existence to the dead,
have been so rationalized in explanation of its use at funerals.

On New Year's day in Athens boys carry a boat and people remark, "St.
Basil is come from Cæsarea".

<span id="fn_263"></span>[153:2](eod33.htm#fr_263.md) See Jackson, *op.
cit.*, pp. 139 *et seq*.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[153:3](eod33.htm#fr_264.md) For a discussion of
this subject see the chapter on "The Psychology of Modesty and
Clothing," in William I. Thomas's "Sex and Society," Chicago, 1907; also
S. Reinach, "Cults, Myths, and Religions," p. 177; and Paton, "The
Pharmakoi and the Story of the Fall," *Revue Archéol.*, Série IV, T. IX,
1907, p. 51.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[154:1](eod33.htm#fr_265.md) It is important to
remember that shell-girdles were used by both sexes for general
life-giving and luck-bringing purposes, in the funerary ritual of both
sexes, in animating the dead or statues of the dead, to attain success
in hunting, fishing, and head-hunting, as well as in games. Thus men
also at times wore shells upon their belts or aprons, and upon their
implements and fishing nets, and adorned their trophies of war and the
chase with them. Such customs are found in all the continents of the Old
World and also in America, as, for example, in the girdles of *Conus*-
and *Oliva*-shells worn by the figures sculptured upon the Copan stelæ.
See, for example, Maudslay's pictures of stele N, Plate 82 (Biologia
Centrali-Americana; Archæology) *inter alia*. But they were much more
widely used by women. not merely by maidens, but also by brides and
married women, to heighten their fertility and cure sterility, and by
pregnant women to ensure safe delivery in child-birth. It was their
wider employment by women that gives these shells their peculiar
cultural significance.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[154:2](eod33.htm#fr_266.md) Witness the
importance of the girdle in early Indian and American sculptures: in the
literature of Egypt, Babylonia, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean
area. For important Indian analogies and Egyptian parallels see Moret,
"Mystères Égyptiens," p. 91, especially note 3. The magic girdle assumed
a great variety of forms as the number of surrogates of the cowry
increased. The mugwort (Artemisia) of Artemis was worn in the girdle on
St. John's Eve (Rendel Harris, *op. cit.*, p. 91): the people of Zante
use vervain in the same way; the people of France (Creuse et Corrères)
rye-stalks; Eve's fig-leaves; in Vedic India the initiate wore the
"cincture of Munga's herbs"; and Kali had her girdle of hands. Breasted,
("Religion and Thought in Ancient Egypt," p. 29) says: "In the oldest
fragments we hear of Isis the great, who *fastened on the girdle* in
Khemmis, when she brought her \[censer\] and burned incense before her
son Horus".

<span id="fn_267"></span>[156:1](eod33.htm#fr_267.md) This distinction
between the significance of the amulet when worn on the girdle and on
the head (in the hair), or as a necklace or bracelet, is very
widespread. On the girdle it *usually* has the significance of
stimulating the individual's fertility: worn elsewhere it was intended
to ward off danger to life, *i.e.* to give good luck. An interesting
surrogate of Hathor's distinctive emblem is the necklace of golden
apples worn by a priestess of Apollo (Rendel Harris, *op. cit.*, p. 42).
