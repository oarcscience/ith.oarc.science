THE JOHN RYLANDS FACSIMILES. A series of reproductions of some of the
more interesting and important of the rarer books in the possession of
the library. The volumes consist of minutely accurate facsimiles of the
works selected, preceded by bibliographical introductions.

1476. ... With an introduction by Henry Guppy. 1909. 8vo, pp. 36, 8. 3s.
6d. *net*.

An oration, pronounced by John Russell, Chancellor of England, on the
investiture of Charles, Duke of Burgundy, with the Order of the Garter,
in February, 1469, at Ghent.

For many years the copy now in the John Rylands Library was considered
to be unique. Until 1807 it lay buried and unnoticed in the heart of a
volume of manuscripts, with which it had evidently been bound up by
mistake. Since then, another copy has been discovered in the library at
Holkam Hall, the seat of the Earl of Leicester.

<span id="page__006"></span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2\. A BOOKE IN ENGLYSH METRE, of the Great Marchaunt man called "Dives
Pragmaticus" … 1563.... With an introduction by Percy E. Newbery; and
remarks on the vocabulary and dialect with a glossary by Henry C. Wyld.
1910. 4to, pp. xxxviii, 16, 5s. *net*.

<span id="img_3star"></span> ![](img/3star.jpg) <span class="small">The
tract here reproduced is believed to be the sole surviving copy of a
quaint little primer which had the laudable object of instructing the
young in the names of trades, professions, ranks, and common objects of
daily life in their own tongue.</span>

3\. A LITIL BOKE the whiche traytied and reherced many gode thinges
necessaries for the .. . Pestilence … made by the ... Bisshop of
Arusiens… \[London\], \[1485?\] …With an introduction by Guthrie Vine.
1910. 4to, pp. xxxvi, 18. 5s. *net*.

<span id="img_3star"></span> ![](img/3star.jpg)

Of this little tract, consisting of nine leaves, written by Benedict
Kanuti, or Knutsson, Bishop of Västerås, three separate editions are
known, but only one copy of each, and an odd leaf are known to have
survived.

There is no indication in any edition of the place of printing, date or
name of printer, but they are all printed in one of the five types
employed by William de Machlinia, who printed first in partnership with
John Lettou and afterwards alone in the City of London, at the time when
William Caxton was at the most active period of his career at
Westminster.

WOODCUTS OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY IN THE JOHN RYLANDS LIBRARY.
Reproduced in facsimile. With an introduction and descriptive notes by
Campbell Dodgson M.A. Folio. Ten plates, of which two are in colour, and
16 pp. of text, in a portfolio. 7s. 6d. *net*.

<span id="img_3star"></span> ![](img/3star.jpg) Two of these woodcuts
are of exceptional interest and importance, and have been known and
celebrated for a century and a half, but have not hitherto been
reproduced in a satisfactory manner by any of the modern
photo-mechanical processes. The two woodcuts referred to represent "St.
Christopher" and "The Annunciation," the former of which has acquired a
great celebrity by reason of the date (1423) which it bears, and which,
until recently, gave to it the unchallenged position of the first dated
woodcut.

THE ODES AND PSALMS OF SOLOMON. Facsimile in collotype of the original
Syriac manuscript in the John Rylands Library, accompanied by a
typographical reprint or transliteration of the text, a revised
translation in English Versicles, and an exhaustive introduction dealing

Museum, the accessory patristic testimonies, and a summary of the most
important criticisms that have appeared since its first publication in
1909. By J. Rendel Harris, M.A., D.Litt., etc., Hon. Fellow of Clare
College, Cambridge, and Alphonse Mingana, D.D. 2 vols. 4to.
