| Fig. 18.—(*a*) The Archaic Egyptian slate palette of Narmer showing, perhaps, the earliest design of Hathor (at the upper corners of the palette) as a woman with cow's horns and ears (compare Flinders Petrie "The Royal Tombs of the First Dynasty," Part I, 1900, Plate XXVII, Fig., 71). The pharaoh is wearing a belt from which are suspended four cow-headed Hathor figures in place of the cowry-amulets of more primitive peoples. This affords corroboration of the view that Hathor assumed the functions originally attributed to the cowry-shell. (*b*) The king's sporran, where Hathor-heads (*H*) take the place of the cowries of the primitive girdle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [150](eod32.htm#img_fig18.md)             |

| Fig. 6.—(*a*) Picture of a bowl of water—the hieroglyphic sign equivalent to *hm* (the word *hmt* means "woman"—Griffith, "Beni Hasan," Part III, Plate VI, Fig. 88 and p. 29). (*b*) "A basket of sycamore figs"—Wilkinson's "Ancient Egyptians," Vol. I, p. 323. (*c*) and (*d*) are said by Wilkinson to be hieroglyphic signs meaning "wife" and are apparently taken from (*b*). But (*c*) is identical with (*i*), which, according to Griffith (p. 14), represents a bivalve shell (g, from Plate III, Fig. 3), more usually placed obliquely (*h*). The varying conventionalizations of (*a*) or (*b*) are shown in (*d*), (*e*), and (*f*) (Griffith, Hieroglyphics," p. 34). (*k*) The sign for a lotus leaf, which is a phonetic equivalent of the sign (*h*), and, according to Griffith ("Hieroglyphics," p. 26), "is probably derived from the same root, on account of its shell-like outline". (*l*) The hieroglyphic sign for a pot of water in such words as *Nu* and *Nut*. (in) A "pomegranate" (replacing a bust of Tanit) upon a sacred column at Carthage (Arthur J. Evans, "Mycenæan Tree and Pillar Cult," p. 46). (*n*) The form of the body of an octopus as conventionalized on the coins of Central Greece (compare Fig. 24 (*d*)) | [179](eod38.htm#img_17900.md)             |
| Fig. 7.—(*a*) An Egyptian design representing the sun-god Horus emerging from a lotus, representing his mother Hathor (Isis). (*b*) Papyrus sceptre often carried by goddesses and animistically identified with them either as an instrument of life-giving or destruction.
