#### THE MANDRAKE.

We have now given reasons for believing that the personification of the
mandrake was in some way brought about by the transference to the plant
of the magical virtues that originally belonged to the cowry shell.

The problem that still awaits solution is the nature of the process by
which the transference was effected.

When I began this investigation the story of the Destruction of Mankind
(see Chapter II) seemed to offer an explanation of the confusion.
Brugsch, Naville, Maspero, Erman, and in fact most Egyptologists, seemed
to be agreed that the magical substance from which the Egyptian elixir
of life was made was the mandrake. As there was no hint <span
id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_363.md) in the Egyptian story of the derivation
of its reputation from the fancied likeness to the human form, its
identification with Hathor seemed to be merely another instance of those
confusions with which the pathway of mythology is so thickly strewn. In
other words, the plant seemed to have been used merely to soothe the
excited goddess: then the other properties of "the food of the gods," of
which it was an ingredient, became transferred to the mandrake, so that
it acquired the reputation of being a "giver of life" as well as a
sedative. If this had been true it would have been a simple process to
identify this "giver of life" with the goddess herself in her rôle as
the "giver of life," and her cowry-ancestor which was credited with the
same reputation.

But this hypothesis is no longer tenable, because the word *d’d’*
(variously transliterated *doudou* or *didi*), which Brugsch <span
id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_364.md) and his followers interpreted as
"mandragora," is now believed to have another meaning.

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

In a closely reasoned memoir, Henri Gauthier <span
id="fr_365"></span>[1](#fn_365.md) has completely demolished Brugsch's
interpretation of this word. He says there are numerous instances of the
use of *d’d’* (which he transliterates *doudouiou*) in the medical
papyri. In the Ebers papyrus "*doudou* d’Eléphantine broyé" is
prescribed as a remedy for external application in diseases of the
heart, and as an astringent and emollient dressing for ulcers. He says
the substance was brought to Elephantine from the interior of Africa and
the coasts of Arabia.

Mr. F. Ll. Griffith informs me that Gauthier's criticism of the
translation "mandrakes" is undoubtedly just: but that the substance
referred to was most probably "red ochre" or "hæmatite". <span
id="fr_366"></span>[2](#fn_366.md)

The relevant passage in the Story of the Destruction of Mankind (in Seti
I’s tomb) will then read as follows: "When they had brought the red
ochre, the Sekti of Heliopolis pounded it, and the priestesses mixed the
pulverized substance with the beer, so that the mixture resembled human
blood".

I would call special attention to Gauthier's comment that the
blood-coloured beer "had some magical and marvellous properly which is
unknown to us". <span id="fr_367"></span>[3](#fn_367.md)

In his dictionary Brugsch considered the determinative <span
id="img_19300"></span> ![](img/19300.jpg) to refer to the fruits of a
tree which he called "apple tree," on the supposed analogy with the
Coptic <span id="img_19301"></span> ![](img/19301.jpg), *fructus
aulumnalis*, *pomus*, the Greek ὀπώρα; and he proposed to identify the
supposed fruit, then transliterated *doudou*, with the Hebrew *doudaïm*,
and translate it *poma amatoria*, mandragora, or in German, *Alraune*.
This interpretation was adopted by most scholars until Gauthier raised
objections to it.

As Loret and Schweinfurth have pointed out, the mandrake is not found in
Egypt, nor in fact in any part of the Nile Valley. <span
id="fr_368"></span>[4](#fn_368.md) But what is more significant, the Greeks
translated the Hebrew

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

*dūdā’im* by μανδράγορας and the Copts did not use the word <span
id="img_19301"></span> ![](img/19301.jpg) in their translations, but
either the Greek word or a term referring to its sedative and soporific
properties. Steindorff has shown (*Zeitsch. f. Ægypt. Sprache*, Bd.
XXVII, 1890, p. 60) that the word in dispute would be more correctly
transliterated "*didi*" instead of "*doudou*".

Finally, in a letter Mr. Griffith tells me the identification of *didi*
with the Coptic <span id="img_19301"></span> ![](img/19301.jpg), "apple
(?)" is philologically impossible.

Although this red colouring matter is thus definitely proved not to be
the fruit of a plant, there are reasons to suggest that when the story
of the Destruction of Mankind spread abroad—and the whole argument of
this book establishes the fact that it did spread abroad—the substance
*didi* was actually confused in the Levant with the mandrake. We have
already seen that in the Delta a prototype of Artemis was already
identified with certain plants.

In all probability *didi* was originally brought into the Egyptian
legend merely as a surrogate of the life-blood, and the mixture of which
it was an ingredient was simply a restorer of youth to the king. But the
determinative (in the tomb of Seti I)—a little yellow disc with a red
border, which misled Naville into believing the substance to be yellow
berries—may also have created confusion in the minds of ancient
Levantine visitors to Egypt, and led them to believe that reference was
being made to their own yellow-berried drug, the mandrake. Such an
incident might have had a two-fold effect. It would explain the
introduction into the Egyptian story of the sedative effects of *didi*,
which would easily be rationalized as a means of soothing the maniacal
goddess; and in the Levant it would have added to the real properties of
mandrake <span id="fr_369"></span>[1](#fn_369.md) the magical virtues which
originally belonged to *didi* (and blood, the cowry, and water).

In my lecture on "Dragons and Rain Gods" (Chapter II) I explained that
the Egyptian story of the Destruction of Mankind is merely one version
of a saga of almost world-wide currency. In many of the non-Egyptian
versions <span id="fr_370"></span>[2](#fn_370.md) the rôle of *didi* in the
Egyptian story is taken

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

by some *vegetable* product of a *red* colour; and many of these
versions reveal a definite confusion between the red fruit and the red
clay, thus proving that the confusion of *didi* with the mandrake is no
mere hypothetical device to evade a difficulty on my part, but did
actually occur.

In the course of the development of the Egyptian story the red clay from
Elephantine became the colouring matter of the Nile flood, and this in
turn was rationalized as the blood or red clay into which the bodies of
the slaughtered enemies of Re were transformed, <span
id="fr_371"></span>[1](#fn_371.md) and the material out of which the new
race of mankind was created. <span id="fr_372"></span>[2](#fn_372.md) In
other words, the new race was formed of *didi*. There is a widespread
legend that the mandrake also is formed from the substance of dead
bodies <span id="fr_373"></span>[3](#fn_373.md)

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

often represented as innocent or chaste men wrongly killed, just as the
red clay was the substance of mankind killed to appease Re's wrath, "the
blood of the slaughtered saints". <span id="fr_374"></span>[1](#fn_374.md)

But the original belief is found in a more definite form in the ancient
story that "the mandrake was fashioned out of the same earth whereof God
formed Adam" <span id="fr_375"></span>[2](#fn_375.md) In other words the
mandrake was part of the same substance as the earth *didi*. <span
id="fr_376"></span>[3](#fn_376.md)

Further corroboration of this confusion is afforded by a story from
Little Russia, quoted by de Gubernatis. <span
id="fr_377"></span>[4](#fn_377.md) If bryony (a widely recognized surrogate
of mandrake) be suspended from the girdle all the dead Cossacks (who,
like the enemies of Re in the Egyptian story, had been killed and broken
to pieces in the earth) will come to life again. *Thus we have positive
evidence of the homology of the mandrake with red clay or hematite*.

The transference to the mandrake of the properties of the cowry (and the
goddesses who were personifications of the shell) and blood (and its
surrogates) was facilitated by the manifold homologies of the Great
Mother with plants. We have already seen that the goddess was identified
with: (*a*) incense-trees and other trees, such as the sycamore, which
played some definite part in the burial ceremonies, either by providing
the divine incense, the materials for preserving the body, or for making
coffins to ensure the protection of the dead, and so make it possible
for them to continue their existence; and (*b*) the

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

lotus, the lily, the iris, and other marsh plants, <span
id="fr_378"></span>[1](#fn_378.md) for reasons that I have already
mentioned (p. 184).

The Babylonian poem of Gilgamesh represents one of the innumerable
versions of the great theme which has engaged the attention of writers
in every age and country attempting to express the deepest longings of
the human spirit. It is the search for the elixir of life. The object of
Gilgamesh's search is a magic *plant* to prolong life and restore youth.
The hero of the story went a voyage by water in order to obtain what
appears to have been a marsh plant called *dittu* <span
id="fr_379"></span>[2](#fn_379.md) The question naturally arises whether
this Babylonian story and the name of the plant played any part in
Palestine in blending the Egyptian and Babylonian stories and confusing
the Egyptian elixir of life, the red earth *didi*, with the Babylonian
elixir, the plant *dittu?*

In the Babylonian story a serpent-demon steals the magic plant, just as
in India *soma*, the food of immortality, is stolen. In Egypt Isis
steals Re's name, <span id="fr_380"></span>[3](#fn_380.md) and in Babylonia
the Zu bird steals the tablets of

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

destiny, the *logos*. In Greek legend apples are stolen from the garden
of Hesperides. Apples are surrogates of the mandrake and *didi*.

We have now seen that the mandrake is definitely a surrogate (*a*) of
the cowry and a series of its shell-homologues, and (*b*) of the red
substance in the Story of the Destruction of Mankind.

There still remain to be determined (*i*) the means by which the
mandrake became identified with the goddess, (ii) the significance of
the Hebrew word *dūdā-īm*, and (iii) the origin of the Greek word
*mandragora*.

The answer to the first of these three queries should now be obvious
enough. As the result of the confusion of the life-giving magical
substance *didi* with the sedative drug, mandrake, the latter acquired
the reputation of being a "giver of life" and became identified with the
"giver of life," the Great Mother, the story of whose exploits was
responsible for the confusion.

The erroneous identification of *didi* with the mandrake was originally
suggested by Brugsch from the likeness of the word (then transliterated
doudou) with the Hebrew word *dūdā-īm* in Genesis, usually translated
"mandrakes". I have already quoted the opinion of Gauthier and Griffith
as to the error of such identification. But the evidence now at our
disposal seems to me to leave no doubt as to the reality of the
confusion of the Egyptian red substance with the mandrake. This
naturally suggests the possibility that the similarity of the sounds of
the words *may* have played some part in creating the confusion: but it
is impossible to admit this as a factor in the development of the story,
because the Hebrew word probably arose out of the identification of the
mandrake with the Great Mother and not by any confusion of names. In
other words the similarity of the names of these homologous substances
is a mere coincidence.

Dr. Rendel Harris claims (and Sir James Frazer seems to approve of the
suggestion) that the Hebrew word *dūdā-īm* was derived from *dōdīm*,
"love"; and, on the strength of this derivation, he soars into a lofty
flight of philological conjecture to transmute *dōdīm* into *Aphrodite*,

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "love" into the
"goddess of love". It would be an impertinence on my part to attempt to
follow these excursions into unknown heights of cloudland.

But my colleagues Professor Canney and Principal Bennett tell me that
the derivation of *dūdā-īm* from *dōdīm* is improbable; and the former
authority suggests that *dūdā-īm* may be merely the plural of *dūd*, a
"pot". <span id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_381.md) Now I have already
explained how a pot came to symbolize a woman or a goddess, not merely
in Egypt, but also in Southern India, and in Mycenæan Greece, and, in
fact, the Mediterranean generally. <span id="fr_382"></span>[2](#fn_382.md)
Hence the use of the term *dūd* for the mandrake implies either (*a*) an
identification of the plant with the goddess who is the giver of life,
or (*b*) an analogy between the form of the mandrake-fruit and a pot,
which in turn led to it being called a pot, and from that being
identified with the goddess. <span id="fr_383"></span>[3](#fn_383.md)

I should explain that when Professor Canney gave me this statement

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

he was not aware of the fact that I had already arrived at the
conclusion that the Great Mother was identified with a pot and also with
the mandrake; but in ignorance of the meaning of the Hebrew words I had
hesitated to equate the pot with the mandrake. As soon as I received his
note, and especially when I read his reference to the second meaning,
"basket of figs," in Jeremiah, I recalled Mr. Griffith's discussion of
the Egyptian hieroglyphic ("a pot of water") for woman, wife, or
goddess, and the claim made by Sir Gardner Wilkinson that this manner of
representing the word for "wife" was apparently taken from a
conventionalized picture of "a basket of sycamore figs". <span
id="fr_384"></span>[1](#fn_384.md) The interpretation has now clearly
emerged that the mandrake was called *dūdā’īm* by the Hebrews because it
was identified with the Mother Pot. The symbolism involved in the use of
the Hebrew word also suggests that the inspiration may have come from
Egypt, where a woman was called "a pot of water" or "a basket of figs".

When the mandrake acquired the definite significance as a symbol of the
Great Mother and the power of life-giving, its fruit, "the love apple,"
became the quintessence of vitality and fertility. The apple and the
pomegranate became surrogates of the "love apple," and were graphically
represented in forms hardly distinguishable from pots, occupying places
which mark them out clearly as homologues of the Great Mother
herself. <span id="fr_385"></span>[2](#fn_385.md)

But once the mandrake was identified with the Great Mother in the Levant
the attributes of the plant were naturally acquired from her local
reputation there. This explains the pre-eminently conchological aspect
of the magical properties of the mandrake and the bryony.

I shall not attempt to refer in detail to the innumerable stories of red
and brown apples, of rowan berries, and a variety of other red fruits
that play a part in the folk-lore of so many peoples, such as *didi*
played in the Egyptian myth. These fruits can be either elixirs of life
and food of the gods, or weapons for overcoming the dragon as Hathor
(Sekhet) was conquered by her sedative draught. <span
id="fr_386"></span>[3](#fn_386.md)

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

In his account of the peony, Pliny ("Nat. Hist.," Book XXVIII, Chap. LX)
says it has "a stem two cubits in length, accompanied by two or three
others, and of a reddish colour, with a bark like that of the laurel....
the seed is enclosed in capsules, *some being red* and some black … it
has an *astringent taste*. The leaves of the female plant *smell like
myrrh*". Bostock and Riley, from whose translation I have made this
quotation, add that in reality the plant is destitute of smell. In the
Ebers papyrus *didi* was mixed with incense in one of the
prescriptions; <span id="fr_387"></span>[1](#fn_387.md) and in the Berlin
medical papyrus it was one of the ingredients of a fumigation used for
treating heart disease. If my contention is justified, it may provide
the explanation of how the confusion arose by which the peony came to
have attributed to it a "smell like myrrh".

Pliny proceeds: "Both plants \[*i.e.* male and female\] grow in the
woods, and they should always be taken up at night, it is said; as it
would be dangerous to do so in the day-time, the woodpecker of Mars
being sure to attack the person so engaged. <span
id="fr_388"></span>[2](#fn_388.md) It is stated also that the person, while
taking up the root, runs great risk of being attacked with \[prolapsus
ani\]. … Both plants are used <span id="fr_389"></span>[3](#fn_389.md) for
various purposes: the red seed, taken in red wine, about fifteen in
number, arrest menstruation; while the black seed, taken in the same
proportion, in either raisin or other wine, are curative of diseases of
the uterus." I refer to these red-coloured beverages and their
therapeutic use in women's complaints to suggest the analogy with that
other red drink administered to the Great Mother, Hathor.

In his essay, "Jacob and the Mandrakes," <span
id="fr_390"></span>[4](#fn_390.md) Sir James Frazer has called attention to
the homologies between the attributes of the peony and the mandrake and
to the reasons for regarding the former as Aelian's *aglaophotis*.

Pliny states("Nat. Hist.," Book XXIV, Chap. CII) that the *aglaophotis* 

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "is found growing
among the marble quarries of Arabia, on the side of Persia," just as the
Egyptian *didi* was obtained near the granite quarries at Aswan. "By
means of this plant \[aglaophotis\], according to Democritus, the Magi
can summon the deities into their presence when they please," just as
the users of the conch-shell trumpet believed they could do with this
instrument. I have already ([p. 196](#page_196).md) emphasized the fact
that all of these plants, mandrake, bryony, peony, and the rest, were
really surrogates of the cowry, the pearl, and the conch-shell. The
first is the ultimate source of their influence on womankind, the second
the origin of their attribute of *aglaophotis*, and the third of their
supposed power of summoning the deity. The attributes of some of the
plants which Pliny discusses along with the peony are suggestive. Pieces
of the root of the *achaemenis* (? perhaps *Euphorbia antiquorum* or
else a night-shade) taken in wine, torment the guilty to such an extent
in their dreams as to extort from them a confession of their crimes. He
gives it the name also of "hippophobas," it being an especial object of
terror to mares. The complementary story is told of the mandrake in
mediæval Europe. The decomposing tissues of the body of an innocent
victim on the gallows when they fall upon the earth can become
reincarnated in a mandrake—the *main de gloire* of old French writers.

Then there is the plant *adamantis*, grown in Armenia and Cappadocia,
which when *presented to a lion makes the beast fall upon its back*, and
drop its jaws. Is this a distorted reminiscence of the
lion-manifestation of Hathor who was calmed by the substance *didi?* A
more direct link with the story of the destruction of mankind is
suggested by the account of the *ophiusa*, "which is found in
Elephantine, an island of Ethiopia". This plant is of a livid colour,
and hideous to the sight. Taken by a person in drink, it inspires such a
horror of serpents, which his imagination continually represents as
menacing him that he commits suicide at last: hence it is that persons
guilty of sacrilege are compelled to drink an infusion of it (Pliny,
"Nat. Hist.," XXIV, 102). I am inclined to regard this as a variant of
the myth of the Destruction of Mankind in which the "snake-plant" from
Elephantine takes the place of the uraei of the Winged Disk Saga, and
punishes the act of sacrilege by driving the delinquent into a state of
delirium tremens.

The next problem to be considered is the derivation of the word

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

*mandragora*. Dr. Mingana tells me it is a great puzzle to discover any
adequate meaning. The attempt to explain it through the Sanskrit *mand*,
"joy," "intoxication," or *mantasana*, "sleep," "life," or *mandra*,
"pleasure," or *mantara*, "paradise tree," and *agru*, "unmarried,
violently passionate," is hazardous and possibly far-fetched.

The Persian is *mardumgiah*, "man-like plant".

The Syro-Arabic word for it is *Yabrouh*, Aramaic *Yahb-kouh*, "giver of
life". This is possibly the source of the Chinese *Yah-puh-lu* (Syriac
*ya-bru-ha*) and *Yah-puh-lu-Yak*. The termination *Yak* is merely the
Turanian termination meaning "diminutive".

The interest of the Levantine terms for the mandrake lies in the fact
that they have the same significance as the word for pearl, *i.e.*
"giver of life". This adds another argument (to those which I have
already given) for regarding the mandrake as a surrogate of the pearl.
But they also reveal the essential fact that led to the identification
of the plant with the Mother-Goddess, which I have already discussed.

In Arabic the mandrake is called *abou ruhr*, "father of life," *i.e.*
"giver of life". <span id="fr_391"></span>[1](#fn_391.md)

In Arabic *margan* means "coral" as well as "pearl". In the
Mediterranean area coral is explained as a new and marvellous plant
sprung from the petrified blood-stained branches on which Perseus hung
the bleeding head of Medusa. Eustathius ("Comment. ad Dionys. Perieget."
1097) derives κορἁλιον from κόρη, personifying the monstrous virgin: but
Chæroboscos claims that it comes from κόρη and ἄλιον, because it is a
maritime product used to make ornaments for maidens. In any case coral
is a "giver of life" and as such identified with a maiden, <span
id="fr_392"></span>[2](#fn_392.md) as the most potential embodiment of
life-giving force. But this specific application of the word for "giver
of life" was due to the fact that in all the Semitic languages, as well
as in literary references in the Egyptian Pyramid Texts, this phrase was
understood as a reference to the female organs of reproduction. The

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

same *double entendre* is implied in the use of the Greek word for "pig"
and "cowry," these two surrogates of the Great Mother, each of which can
be taken to mean the "giver of life" or the "pudendum muliebre".

Perhaps the most plausible suggestion that has been made as to the
derivation of the word "mandragora" is Delâtré s claim <span
id="fr_393"></span>[1](#fn_393.md) that it is compounded of the words
*mandros*, "sleep," and *agora*, "object or substance," and that
mandragora means "the sleep-producing substance".

This derivation is in harmony with my suggestion as to the means by
which the plant acquired its magical properties. The sedative substance
that, in the Egyptian hieroglyphs (of the Story of the Destruction of
Mankind), was represented by yellow spheres with a red covering was
confused in Western Asia with the yellow-berried plant which was known
to have sedative properties. Hence the plant was confused with the
mineral and so acquired all the magical properties of the Great Mother's
elixir. But the Indian name is descriptive of the actual properties of
the plant and is possibly the origin of the Greek word.

Another suggestion that has been made deserves some notice. It has been
claimed that the first syllable of the name is derived from the Sanskrit
*mandara*, one of the trees in the Indian paradise, and the instrument
with which the churning of the ocean was accomplished. <span
id="fr_394"></span>[2](#fn_394.md) The mandrake has been claimed to be the
tree of the Hebrew paradise; and a connexion has thus been instituted
between it and the *mandara*. This hypothesis, however, does not offer
any explanation of how either the mandrake or the *mandara* acquired its
magical attributes. The Indian tree of life was supposed to "sweat"
*amrita* just as the incense trees of Arabia produce the divine
life-giving incense.

But there are reasons <span id="fr_395"></span>[3](#fn_395.md) for the
belief that the Indian story of the churning of the sea of milk is a
much modified version of the old Egyptian story of the pounding of the
materials for the elixir of life. The *mandara* churn-stick, which is
often supposed to represent the

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

phallus, <span id="fr_396"></span>[1](#fn_396.md) was originally the tree
of life, the tree or pillar which was animated by the Great Mother
herself. <span id="fr_397"></span>[2](#fn_397.md) So that the mandara is
homologous with the *mandragora*. But so far as I am aware, there is no
adequate reason for deriving the latter word from the former.

The derivation from the Sanskrit words *mandros* and *agora* seems to
fit naturally into the scheme of explanation which I have been
formulating.

In the Egyptian story the Sekti of Heliopolis pounded the *didi* in a
mortar to make "the giver of life," which by a simple confusion might be
identified with the goddess herself in her capacity as "the giver of
life". This seems to have occurred in the Indian legend. Lakshmi, or
Sri, was born at the churning of the ocean. Like Aphrodite, who was born
from the sea-foam churned from the ocean, Lakshmi was the goddess of
beauty, love, and prosperity.

Before leaving the problems of mandrake and the homologous plants and
substances, it is important that I should emphasize the rôle of blood
and blood-substitutes, red-stained beer, red wine, red earth, and red
berries in the various legends. These life-giving and death-dealing
substances were all associated with the colour red, and the destructive
demons Sekhet and Set were given red forms, which in turn were
transmitted to the dragon, and to that specialized form of the dragon
which has become the conventional way of representing Satan.

\[The whole of the mandrake legend spread to China and became attached
to the plants *ginseng* and *shang luh*—see de Groot, Vol. II, p. 316
*et seq*.; also Kumagusu Minakata, *Nature*, Vol. LI, April 25, 1895, p.
608, and Vol. LIV, Aug. 13, 1896, p. 343. The

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

fact that the Chinese make use of the Syriac word *yabruha* (*vide
supra*) suggests the source of these Chinese legends.\]

nature for minimizing the significance of the geographical question.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[194:1](eod40.htm#fr_369.md) For the therapeutic
effects of mandrake see the *British Medical Journal*, 15 March, 1890,
p. 620.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[194:2](eod40.htm#fr_370.md) Even in Egypt itself
*didi* may be replaced by fruit in the more specialized variants of the
Destruction of Mankind. Thus, in the Saga of the Winged Disk, Re is
reported to have said to Horus: "Thou didst put grapes in the water
which cometh forth from Edfu". Wiedemann ("Religion of the Ancient
Egyptians," p. 70) interprets this as meaning: "thou didst cause <span
id="page_195">p. 195</span> the red blood of the enemy to flow into it".
But by analogy with the original version, as modified by Gauthier's
translation of *didi*, it should read: "thou didst make the water
blood-red with grape-juice"; or perhaps be merely a confused jumble of
the two meanings.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[195:1](eod40.htm#fr_371.md) In the Babylonian
story of the Deluge "Ishtar cried aloud like a woman in travail, the
Lady of the gods lamented with a loud voice (saying): The old race of
man hath been turned back into clay, because I assented to an evil thing
in the council of the gods, and agreed to a storm which hath destroyed
my people that which I brought forth" (King, "Babylonian Religion," p.
134).

The Nile god, Knum, Lord of Elephantine, was reputed to have formed the
world of alluvial soil. The coming of the waters from Elephantine
brought life to the earth.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[195:2](eod40.htm#fr_372.md) In the Babylonian
story, Bēl "bade one of the gods cut off his head and mix the earth with
the blood that flowed from him, and from the mixture he directed him to
fashion men and animals" (King, "Babylonian Religion," p. 56). Bēl
(Marduk) represents the Egyptian Horus who assumes his mother's rôle as
the Creator. The red earth as a surrogate of blood in the Egyptian story
is here replaced by earth *and* blood.

But Marduk created not only men and animals but heaven and earth also.
To do this he split asunder the carcase of the dragon which he had
slain, the Great Mother Tiamat, the evil *avatar* of the Mother-Goddess
whose mantle had fallen upon his own shoulders. In other words, he
created the world out of the substance of the "giver of life" who was
identified with the red earth, which was the elixir of life in the
Egyptian story. This is only one more instance of the way in which the
same fundamental idea was twisted and distorted in every conceivable
manner in the process of rationalization. In one version of the Osirian
myth Horus cut off the head of his mother Isis and the moon-god Thoth
replaced it with a cow's head, just as in the Indian myth Ganesa's head
was replaced by an elephant's.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[195:3](eod40.htm#fr_373.md) See Frazer, *op.
cit.*, p. 9.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[196:1](eod40.htm#fr_374.md) Compare with this the
story of Picus the giant who fled to Kirke's isle and there was slain by
Helios, the plant μῶλυ springing from his blood (A. B. Cook, "Zeus," p.
241, footnote 15). For a discussion of *moly* see Andrew Lang's "Custom
and Myth".

<span id="fn_375"></span>[196:2](eod40.htm#fr_375.md) Frazer, p. 6.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[196:3](eod40.htm#fr_376.md) In Socotra a tree
(dracæna) has been identified with the dragon, and its exudation,
"dragon's blood," was called cinnabar, and confused with the mineral
(red sulphide of mercury), or simply with red ochre. In the Socotran
dragon-myth the elephant takes the hero's rôle, as in the American
stories of Chac and Tlaloc (see Chapter II). The word *kinnabari* was
applied to the thick matter that issues from the dragon when crushed
beneath the weight of the dying elephant during these combats (Pliny,
XXXIII, 28 and VIII, 12). The dragon had a passion for elephant's blood.
Any thick red earth attributed to such combats was called *kinnabari*
(Schoff, *op. cit.*, p. 137). This is another illustration of the
ancient belief in the identification of blood and red ochre.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[196:4](eod40.htm#fr_377.md) "Mythologie des
Plantes," Vol. II, p. 101.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[197:1](eod40.htm#fr_378.md) In an interesting
article on "The Water Lilies of Ancient Egypt" (*Ancient Egypt*, 1917,
Part I, p. 1) Mr. W. D. Spanton has collected a series of illustrations
of the symbolic use of these plants. In view of the fact that the
papyrus- and lotus-sceptres and the lotus-designs played so prominent a
part in the evolution of the Greek thunder-weapon, it is peculiarly
interesting to find (in the remote times of the Pyramid Age) lotus
designs built up into the form of the double-axe (Spanton's Figs. 28 and
29) and the classical *keraunos* (his Fig. 19).

<span id="fn_379"></span>[197:2](eod40.htm#fr_379.md) The Babylonian magic
plant to prolong life and renew youth, like the red mineral *didi* of
the Egyptian story. It was also "the plant of birth" and "the plant of
life".

<span id="fn_380"></span>[197:3](eod40.htm#fr_380.md) Müller, Quibell,
Maspero, and Sethe regard the "round cartouche," which the divine falcon
often carries in place of the *ankh*-symbol of life, as a representation
of the royal name (R. Weill, "Les Origines de l’Egypte pharaonique,"
*Annales du Musée Guimet*, 1908, p. 111). The analogous Babylonian sign
known as "the rod and ring" is described by Ward (oh. cit., p. 413) as
"the emblem of the sun-god's supremacy," a "symbol of majesty and power,
like the tablets of destiny".

As it was believed in Egypt and Babylonia that the possession of a name
"was equivalent to being in existence," we can regard the object carried
by the hawk or vulture as a token of the giving of life and the
controlling of destiny. It can probably be equated with the "tablets of
destiny" so often mentioned in the Babylonian stories, which the bird
god *Zu* stole from Bēl and was compelled by the sun-god to restore
again. Marduk was given the power to destroy or to create, *to speak the
word of command* and to control fate, to wield the invincible weapon and
to be able to render objects invisible. This form of the weapon, "the
word" or *logos*, <span id="page_198">p. 198</span> like all the other
varieties of the thunder-weapon, could "become flesh," in other words,
be an animate form of the god.

In Egyptian art it is usually the hawk of Horus (the homologue of
Marduk) which carries the "round cartouche," which is the logos, the
tablets of destiny.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[199:1](eod40.htm#fr_381.md) I quote Professor
Canney's notes on the word *dūdā-īm* (Genesis xxx. 14) verbatim: "The
*[Encyclopædia](errata.htm#8) Biblica* says (s.v. 'Mandrakes'.md): 'The
Hebrew name, *dūdā’im*, was no doubt popularly associated with *dōdīm*,
‏דּוֹדִים‎, "love"; but its real etymology (like that of μανδράγορας) is
obscure'.

.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .

"The same word is translated 'mandrakes' in Song of Songs vii. 13.

"Dūdā’īm occurs also in Jeremiah xxiv, 1, where it is usually translated
'baskets' ('baskets of figs'). Here it is the plural of a word *dūd*,
which means sometimes a 'pot' or 'kettle,' sometimes a 'basket'. The
etymology is again doubtful.

I should imagine that the words in Jeremiah and Genesis have somehow or
other the same etymology, and that *dūdā-īm* in Genesis has no real
connexion with *dōdīm* 'love'.

The meaning 'pot' (*dūd*, plur. *dūdā-īm*) is probably more original
than 'basket'. Does *dūdā-īm* in Genesis and Song of Songs denote some
kind of pot or caldron-shaped flower or fruit?"

<span id="fn_382"></span>[199:2](eod40.htm#fr_382.md) The Mother Pot is
really a fundamental conception of all religious beliefs and is almost
worldwide in its distribution.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[199:3](eod40.htm#fr_383.md) The fruit of the
lotus (which is a form of Hathor) assumes a form (Spanton, *op. cit.*,
Fig. 51) that is identical with a common Mediterranean symbol of the
Great Mother, called "pomegranate" by Sir Arthur Evans (see my
[text-fig. 6](eod38.htm#img_17900), [p. 179](eod38.htm#page_179), *m*.md),
which is a surrogate of the apple and mandrake. The likeness to the
Egyptian hieroglyph for a jar of water ([text-fig.
6](eod38.htm#img_17900), *l*.md) and the goddess *Nu* of the fruit of the
poppy (which was closely associated with the mandrake by reason of its
soporific properties) may have assisted in the transference of their
attributes. The design of the water-plant ([text-fig.
7](eod38.htm#img_17900), *d*.md) associated with the Nile god may have
helped such a confusion and exchange.

the Ancient Egyptians," revised and abridged, 1890, Vol. I, p. 323.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[200:2](eod40.htm#fr_385.md) See, for example, Sir
Arthur Evans, "Mycenæan Tree and Pillar Worship," Fig. 27, p. 46.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[200:3](eod40.htm#fr_386.md) In a Japanese
dragon-story the dragon drinks "sake" from pots set out on the shore (as
Hathor drank the *didi* mixture from pots associated <span
id="page_201">p. 201</span> with the river); and the intoxicated monster
was then slain. From its tail the hero extracted a sword (as in the case
of the Western dragons), which is now said to be the Mikado's state
sword.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[201:2](eod40.htm#fr_388.md) Compare the
dog-incident in the mandrake story.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[201:3](eod40.htm#fr_389.md) Bostock and Riley add
the comment that "the peony has no medicinal virtues whatever".

British Academy*, Vol. VIII, 1917, p. 16 (in the reprint).

<span id="fn_391"></span>[203:1](eod40.htm#fr_391.md) I am indebted to Dr.
Alphonse Mingana for this information. But the philological question is
discussed in a learned memoir by the late Professor P. J. Veth, "De Leer
der Signatuur," *Internationales Archiv für Ethnographie*, Leiden, Bd.
VII, 1894, pp. 75 and 105, and especially the appendix, p. 199 *et
seq*., "De Mandragora, Naschrift op het tweede Hoofdstuk der
Verhandeling over de Leer der Signatur".

<span id="fn_392"></span>[203:2](eod40.htm#fr_392.md) Like the *Purpura*
and the *Pterocera*, the bryony and other shells and plants.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[204:1](eod40.htm#fr_393.md) Larousse, Article
"Mandragore".

<span id="fn_394"></span>[204:2](eod40.htm#fr_394.md) I have already
referred to another version of the churning of the ocean in which Mount
Meru was used as a churn-stick and identified with the Great Mother, of
whom the *mandara* was also an *avatar*.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[204:3](eod40.htm#fr_395.md) Which I shall discuss
in my forthcoming book on "The Story of the Flood".

<span id="fn_396"></span>[205:1](eod40.htm#fr_396.md) The phallic
interpretation is certainly a secondary rationalization of an incident
which had no such implication originally.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[205:2](eod40.htm#fr_397.md) The "tree of the
knowledge of good and evil" (Genesis ii. 17) produced fruit the eating
of which opened the eyes of Adam and Eve, so that they realized their
nakedness: they became conscious of sex and made girdles of fig-leaves
(*vide supra*, [p. 155](eod33.htm#page_155).md). In other words, the tree
of life had the power of love-provoking like the mandrake. In
Henderson's "Celtic Dragon Myth" (p. xl) we read: "The berries for which
she \[Medb\] craved were from the Tree of Life, the food of the gods,
the eating of which by mortals brings death," and further: "The berries
of the rowan tree are the berries of the gods" (p. xliii). I have
already suggested the homology between these red berries, the mandrake,
and the red ochre of Hathor's elixir. Thus we have another suggestion of
the identity of the tree of paradise and the mandrake.
