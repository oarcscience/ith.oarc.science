#### GOLD AND THE GOLDEN APHRODITE.

The evidence which has been collected by Mr. Wilfrid Jackson seems to
suggest that the shell-cults originated in the neighbourhood of the Red
Sea.

With the introduction of the practice of wearing shells on girdles

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

and necklaces and as hair ornaments the time arrived when people living
some distance from the sea experienced difficulty in obtaining these
amulets in quantities sufficient to meet their demands. Hence they
resorted to the manufacture of imitations of these shells in clay and
stone. But at an early period in their history the inhabitants of the
deserts between the Nile and the Red Sea (Hathor's special province)
discovered that they could make more durable and attractive models of
cowries and other shells by using the plastic yellow metal which was
lying about in these deserts unused and unappreciated. This practice
first gave to the metal gold an arbitrary value which it did not possess
before. For the peculiar life-giving attributes of the shells modelled
in the yellow metal came to be transferred to the gold itself. No doubt
the lightness and especially the beauty of such gold models appealed
to<span id="img_22200"></span>

the early Egyptians, and were in large measure responsible for the hold
gold acquired over mankind. But this was an outcome of the empirical
knowledge gained from a practice that originally was inspired purely by
cultural and not æsthetic motives. The earliest Egyptian hieroglyphic
sign for gold was a picture of a necklace of such amulets; and this
emblem became the determinative of the Great Mother Hathor, not only
because she was originally the personification of the life-giving
shells, but also because she was the guardian deity both of the Eastern
wadys where the gold was found and of the Red Sea coasts where the
cowries were obtained. Hence she became the "Golden Hathor," the
prototype of the "Golden Aphrodite".

It is a significant token of the influence of these Egyptian incidents
upon the history of the Ægean that among the earliest gold ornaments
found by Schliemann at Troy were a series of crude representations of
cowries worn as pendants to a hair ornament. <span
id="fr_435"></span>[1](#fn_435.md)

It is hardly necessary to insist upon the vast influence upon the
history of civilization which this arbitrary value of gold has been
responsible for exerting. For more than fifty centuries men have been

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

searching for the precious metal, and have been spreading abroad
throughout the world the elements of our civilization. It has been not
only the chief factor in bringing about the contact of peoples <span
id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_436.md) and incidentally in building up our
culture, but it has been the cause, directly or indirectly, of most of
the warfare which has afflicted mankind. Yet these mighty forces were
let loose upon the world as the result of the circumstance that early
searchers for an elixir of life used the valueless metal to make
imitations of their shell amulets!

The identification of gold with cowries may not have been the primary
reason for the invention of gold currency. In fact, Professor Ridgeway
has called attention to certain historical events which in his opinion
forced men to convert their jewellery into coinage. But the fact that
cowries were the earliest form of currency may have prepared the way for
the recognition of the use of gold for a similar purpose. Moreover, we
know that long before a real gold currency came into being rings of gold
were in Egypt a form of tribute and a sign of wealth. Cowries acquired
their significance as currency as the result of incidents in some
respects analogous to those which impelled the early Egyptians to make
gold models of the shells. In places in Africa far removed from the sea
where the practice has grown up of offering vast numbers of cowries to
brides on the occasion of their marriage (as fertility amulets) or of
putting the shells in the grave (to secure for the dead fresh vital
energy), the people offered their most treasured possessions, such as
their cattle, in exchange for the amulets which were believed to confer
such priceless social and religious boons. Cattle were therefore given
in exchange for cowries, or the shells were used for the
[purchase](errata.htm#10.md) of wives. When the new significance as
currency developed a remarkable confusion occurred. In many places
cowries were placed in the mouth of the dead to confer the breath of
life: but when the cowries acquired the new meaning as currency, the
people who had lost all knowledge of the original significance of this
practice explained the cowries as money with which to pay Charon's fare
to the other world. Then, in many places, the cowry was replaced by an
actual metallic coin. Most scholars fall into the same error as these
ancient rationalists,

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

and accept their explanation of the *obolus* as though it were the real
meaning of the act.

Another result of the use of gold models of shells as life-giving
amulets was that the metal also acquired the reputation of being a giver
of life, <span id="fr_437"></span>[1](#fn_437.md) which originally belonged
merely to the shell or the imitation of its form, whatever the substance
used for making the model.

Thus gold came to share the same magical reputation as the cowry and the
pearl. It was also put to the same use: it was buried with the dead to
confer a continuation of existence.

Not only was Hathor called Nūb, *i.e.* "gold" or the golden Hathor: but
the place where the funerary statue was made ("born") in Egypt was
called the "House of Gold" and personified as a goddess who gave rebirth
to the dead (Alan Gardiner, "The Tomb of Amenemhēt," p. 95; and A. M.
Blackman, *Journal of Egyptian Archæology*, Vol. IV, p. 127).

When ancient prospectors from the South exploited the rivers of
Turkestan for alluvial gold and fresh water pearls, incidentally they
also collected pebbles of jade for the purpose of making seals. The
local inhabitants confused the properties of the stone with the magical
reputation of the gold and the pearls. One outcome of this jade-fishing
in Turkestan was the transference of the credit of life-giving to jade.
Prospectors searching for these precious materials gradually made their
way east past Lob Nor, and eventually discovered the deposits of gold
and jade in the Shensi province. Thus jade became the nucleus around
which the distinctive civilization of China became crystallized. It
played an obtrusive part not only in attracting men from the West and in
determining the locality where the germs of Western civilization were
planted in China, but also in giving Chinese culture its distinctive
shape.

"The ancient Chinese, wishing to facilitate the resurrection of the
dead, surrounded them with jade, gold, pearls, timber, and other things
imbued with influences emitted from the heavens, or, in other words,
with such objects as are pervaded with vital energy derived from the
Yang matter of which the heavens are the principal depository" (De
Groot, *op. cit.*, p. 316).

By a similar process diamonds acquired the same reputation in India when
searchers after gold discovered the precious metal in Hyderabad,

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

and the diamonds of Golconda came to be accredited with life-giving
powers. <span id="fr_438"></span>[1](#fn_438.md)

According to the beliefs of the Indians "the Nâga owns riches, the water
of life, and a jewel that restores the dead to life".

Thus gold, pearls, jade, and diamonds in course of time acquired the
reputation of elixirs of life, but the hold they established upon
mankind was due to the fact (*a*) that the amulets made of these
materials made a strong appeal to the æsthetic sense, and (*b*) the
arbitrary value assigned to them made them desirable objects to search
for.

In his "Mycenæan Tree and Pillar Cult" (1901) Sir Arthur Evans gives
cogent reasons for the view that at the time when Mycenæan influence was
powerful in Cyprus "the 'golden Aphroditê' of the Egyptians seems to
play a much more important part than any form of Astarte or Mylitta" (p.
52). "The Cypriote parallels will be found to have a fundamental
importance as demonstrating in detail that these \['a simple form of the
palmette pillar, approaching a fleur-de-lys in outline,' in association
with its guardian monsters\] are in fact taken over from the cult of
Mentu-Ra, the Warrior Sun-god of Egypt, of Hathor, and of Horus" (p.
52).

<span id="fn_435"></span>[222:1](eod44.htm#fr_435.md) So far as I am aware
the fact that these objects were intended to represent cowries does not
appear to have been recognized hitherto. I am indebted to Mr. Wilfrid
Jackson for calling my attention to the figures 685 and 832 in
Schliemann's "Ilios" (1880), and for identifying the objects.
