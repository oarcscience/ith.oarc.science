#### THE MOON AND THE SKY-WORLD.

There are reasons for believing that the chief episodes in Aphrodite's
past point to the Red Sea for their inspiration, though many other
factors, due partly to local circumstances and partly to contact with
other civilizations, contributed to the determination of the traits of
the Mediterranean goddess of love. In Babylonia and India there are very
definite signs of borrowing from the same source. It is important,
therefore, to look for further evidence to Arabia as the obvious bond of
union both with Phœnicia and Babylonia.

The claim made in Roscher's *Lexicon der Mythologie* that the Assyrian
Ishtar, the Phœnician Ashtoreth (Astarte), the Syrian Atargatis
(Derketo), the Babylonian Belit (Mylitta) and the Arabian Ilat (Al-ilat)
were all moon-goddesses has given rise to much rather aimless
discussion, for there can be no question of their essential homology
with Hathor and Aphrodite. Moreover, from the beginning, all
goddesses—and especially this most primitive stratum of fertility
deities—were for obvious reasons intimately associated with the
moon. <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94.md) But the cyclical periodicity
of the moon which suggested the analogy with the similar physiological
periodicity of women merely explains the association of the moon with
women. The influence of the moon upon dew and the tides, perhaps,
suggested its controlling power over water and emphasized the
life-giving function which its association with women had already
suggested. For reasons which have been explained already, water was
associated more especially with fertilization by the male. Hence the
symbolism of the moon came to include the control of both the male and
the female processes of reproduction. <span
id="fr_95"></span>[2](#fn_95.md)

The literature relating to the development of these ideas with reference

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

to the moon has been summarized by Professor Hutton Webster. <span
id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96.md) He shows that "there is good reason for
believing that among many primitive peoples the moon, rather than the
sun, the planets or any of the constellations, first excited the
imagination and aroused feelings of superstitious awe or of religious
veneration".

Special attention was first devoted to the moon when agricultural
pursuits compelled men to measure time and determine the seasons. The
influence of the moon on water, both the tides and dew, brought it
within the scope of the then current biological theory of fertilization.
This conception was powerfully corroborated by the parallelism of the
moon's cycles and those of womankind, which was interpreted by regarding
the moon as the controlling power of the female reproductive functions.
Thus all of the earliest goddesses who were personifications of the
powers of fertility came to be associated, and in some cases identified,
with the moon.

In this way the animation and deification of the moon was brought about:
and the first sky deity assumed not only all the attributes of the
cowry, *i.e.* the female reproductive functions, but also, as the
controller of water, many of those which afterwards were associated with
Osiris. The confusion of the male fertilizing powers of Osiris with the
female reproductive functions of Hathor and Isis may explain 'how in
some places the moon became a masculine deity, who, however, still
retained his control over womankind, and caused the phenomena of
menstruation by the exercise of his virile powers. <span
id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_97.md) But the moon-god was also a measurer of
time and in this aspect was specially personified in Thoth.

The assimilation of the moon with these earth-deities was probably
responsible for the creation of the first sky-deity. For once the
conception developed of identifying a deity with the moon, and the
Osirian beliefs associated with the deification of a dead king grew up,
the moon became the impersonation of the spirit of womankind, some
mortal woman who by death had acquired divinity.

After the idea had developed of regarding the moon as the spirit

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

of a dead person, it was only natural that, in course of time, the sun
and stars should be brought within the scope of the same train of
thought, and be regarded as the deified dead. When this happened, the
sun not unnaturally soon leapt into a position of pre-eminence. As the
moon represented the deified female principle the sun became the
dominant male deity Re. The stars also became the spirits of the dead.

Once this new conception of a sky-world was adumbrated a luxuriant crop
of beliefs grew up to assimilate the new beliefs with the old, and to
buttress the confused mixture of incompatible ideas with a complex
scaffolding of rationalization.

The sun-god Horus was already the son of Osiris. Osiris controlled not
only the river and the irrigation canals, but also the rain-clouds. The
fumes of incense conveyed to the sky-gods the supplications of the
worshippers on earth. Incense was not only "the perfume that deifies,"
but also the means by which the deities and the dead could pass to their
doubles in the newly invented sky-heaven. The sun-god Re was represented
in his temple not by an anthropoid statue, but by an obelisk, <span
id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_98.md) the gilded apex of which pointed to heaven
and "drew down" the dazzling rays of the sun, reflected from its
polished surface, so that all the worshippers could see the
manifestations of the god in his temple.

These events are important, not only for creating the sky-gods and the
sky-heaven, but possibly also for suggesting the idea that even a mere
pillar of stone, whether carved or uncarved, upon which no attempt had
been made to model the human form, could represent the deity, or rather
could become the "body" to be animated by the god. <span
id="fr_99"></span>[2](#fn_99.md) For once it was admitted, even in the home
of these ancient ideas concerning the animation of statues, that it was
not essential for the idol to be shaped into human form, the way was
opened for less cultured peoples, who had not acquired the technical
skill to carve statues, simply to erect stone pillars or unshaped masses
of stone or

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

wood for their gods to enter, when the appropriate ritual of animation
was performed. <span id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100.md)

This conception of the possibility of gods, men, or animals dwelling in
stones spread in course of time throughout the world, but in every place
where it is found certain arbitrary details of the methods of animating
the stone reveal the fact that all these legends must have been derived
from the same source.

The complementary belief in the possibility of the petrifaction of men
and animals has a similarly extensive geographical distribution. The
history of this remarkable incident I shall explain in the lecture on
"Dragons and Rain Gods" (Chapter II.). <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_94"></span>[56:1](eod14.htm#fr_94.md) I am not concerned here
with the explanation of the means by which their home became transferred
to the planet Venus.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[56:2](eod14.htm#fr_95.md) In his discussion of the
functions of the Fravashis in the Iranian Yasht, the late Professor
Moulton suggested the derivation of the word from the Avestan root
*var*, "to impregnate," so that *fravaŝi* might mean "birth-promotion".
But he was puzzled by a reference to water. "Less easy to understand is
their intimate connexion with the Waters" ("Early Religious Poetry of
Persia," pp. 142 and 143). But the Waters were regarded as fertilizing
agents. This is seen in the Avestan Anahita, who was "the presiding
genie of Fertility and more especially of the Waters" (W. J.
Phythian-Adams, "Mithraism," 1915, p. 13).

<span id="fn_96"></span>[57:1](eod14.htm#fr_96.md) "Rest Days," New York,
1916, pp. 124 *et seq*.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[57:2](eod14.htm#fr_97.md) Wherever these deities
of fertility are found, whether in Egypt, Babylonia, the Mediterranean
Area, Eastern Asia, and America, illustrations of this confusion of sex
are found. The explanation which Dr. Rendel Harris offers of this
confusion in the case of Aphrodite seems to me not to give due
recognition to its great antiquity and almost world-wide distribution.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[58:1](eod14.htm#fr_98.md) L. Borchardt, "Das
Re-heiligtum des Königs Ne-woser-re".

For a good exposition of this matter see A. Moret, "Sanctuaires de
l’ancien Empire Égyptien," *Annales du Musée Guimet*, 1912, p. 265.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[58:2](eod14.htm#fr_99.md) It is possible that the
ceremony of erecting the *dad* columns may have played some part in the
development of these beliefs. (On this see A. Moret, "Mystères
Égyptiens," 1913, pp. 13-17.)

<span id="fn_100"></span>[59:1](eod14.htm#fr_100.md) Many other factors
played a part in the development of the stories of the birth of
ancestors from stones. I have already referred to the origin of the idea
of the cowry (or some other shell) as the parent of mankind. The place
of the shell was often taken by roughly carved stones, which of course
were accredited with the same power of being able to produce men, or of
being a sort of egg from which human beings could be hatched. It is
unlikely that the finding of fossilized animals played any leading rôle
in the development of these beliefs, beyond affording corroborative
evidence in support of them after other circumstances had been
responsible for originating the stories. The more circumstantial
Oriental stories of the splitting of stones giving birth to heroes and
gods may have been suggested by the finding in pebbles of fossilized
shells—themselves regarded already as the parents of mankind. But such
interpretations were only possible because all the predisposing
circumstances had already prepared the way for the acceptance of these
specific illustrations of a general theory.

These beliefs may have developed before and quite independently of the
ideas concerning the animation of statues; but if so the latter event
would have strengthened and in some places become merged with the other
story.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[59:2](eod14.htm#fr_101.md) For an extensive
collection of these remarkable petrifaction legends in almost every part
of the world, see E. Sidney Hartland's "The Legend of Perseus,"
especially Volumes I and III. These distinctive stories will be found to
be complexly interwoven with all the matters discussed in this address.
