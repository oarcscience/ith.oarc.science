#### APPENDIX C.

Prof. Barton's statement (*supra*, [p. 64](eod16.htm#page_64).md) is
typical of a widespread misapprehension, resulting from the confusion
between sexual relations and the giving of life. At first primitive
people did not realize that the manifestations of the sex instinct had
anything whatever to do with reproduction. They were aware of the fact
that women gave birth to children; and the organ concerned in this
process was regarded as the giver of life, the creator. The apotheosis
of these powers led to the conception of the first deity. But it was
only secondarily that these life-giving attributes were brought into
association with the sexual act and the masculine powers of
fertilization. Much confusion has been created by those writers who see
manifestations of the sexual factor and phallic ideas in every aspect of
primitive religion, where in most cases only the power of life-giving
plays a part.
