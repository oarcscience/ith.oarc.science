#### SHARKS AND DRAGONS.

When the life-giving attributes of water were confused with the same
properties with which shells had independently been credited

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

long before, the shell's reputation was rationalized as an expression of
the vital powers of the ocean in which the mollusc was born. But the
same explanation was also extended to include fishes, and other denizens
of the water, as manifestations of similar divine powers. In the lecture
on "Dragons and Rain Gods" I referred to the identification of Ea, the
Babylonian Osiris, with a fish ([p. 105](eod23.htm#page_105).md). When the
value of the pearl as the giver of life impelled men to incur any risks
to obtain so precious an amulet, the chief dangers that threatened
pearl-fishers were due to sharks. These came to be regarded as demons
guarding the treasure-houses at the bottom of the sea. Out of these
crude materials the imaginations of the early pearl-fishers created the
picture of wonderful submarine palaces of Nâga kings in which vast
wealth, not merely of pearls, but also of gold, precious stones, and
beautiful maidens (all of them "givers of life," *vide infra*, p. 224),
were placed under the protection of shark-dragons. <span
id="fr_272"></span>[1](#fn_272.md) The conception of the pearl (which is a
surrogate of the life-giving Great Mother) guarded by dragons is linked
by many bonds of affinity with early Erythræan and Mediterranean
beliefs. The more usual form of the story, both in Southern Arabian
legend and in Minoan and Mycenæan art, represents the Mother Goddess
incarnate in a sacred tree or pillar with its protecting dragons in the
form of serpents or lions, or a variety of dragon-surrogates, either
real animals, such as deer or cattle, or composite monsters ([Fig.
26](eod39.htm#img_fig26)). <span id="fr_273"></span>[2](#fn_273.md)

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

There are reasons for believing that these stories were first invented
somewhere on the shores of the Erythræan Sea, probably in Southern
Arabia. The animation of the incense-tree by the Great Mother, for the
reasons which I have already expounded, <span
id="fr_274"></span>[1](#fn_274.md) formed the link of her identification
with the pearl, which probably acquired its magical reputation in the
same region.

"In the Persian myth, the white Haoma is a divine tree, growing in the
lake Vourukasha: the fish Khar-mâhî circles protectingly around it and
defends it against the toad Ahriman. It gives eternal life, children to
women, husbands to girls, and horses to men. In the Minôkhired the tree
is called 'the preparer of the corpse'" (Spiegel, "Eran.
Altertumskunde," II, 115—quoted by Jung, "Psychology of the
Unconscious," p. 532). The idea of guarding the divine tree <span
id="fr_275"></span>[2](#fn_275.md) by dragons was probably the result of
the transference to that particular surrogate of the Great Mother of the
shark-stories which originated from the experiences of the seekers after
pearls, her other representatives.

There are many other bits of corroborative evidence to suggest

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

that these shell-cults and the legends derived from them were actually
transmitted from the Red Sea to the Eastern Mediterranean. Nor is it
surprising that this should have happened, when it is recalled that
Egyptian sailors were trafficking in both seas long before the Pyramid
Age, and no doubt carried the beliefs and the legends of one region to
the other. I have already referred to the adoption in the Mediterranean
area of the idea of the dragon-protectors of the tree- and pillar-forms
of the Great Mother, and suggested that this was merely a garbled
version of the pearl-fisher's experience of the dangers of attacks by
sharks. But the same legends also reached the Levant in a less modified
form, and then underwent another kind of transformation (and confusion
with the tree-version) in Cyprus or Syria.

As the shark would be a not wholly appropriate actor in the
Mediterranean, its rôle is taken by its smaller Selachian relative, the
dog-fish. In the notes on Pliny's Natural History, Dr. Bostock and Mr.
H. T. Riley <span id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_276.md) refer to the habits of
dog-fishes ("Canes marini"), and quote from Procopius ("De Bell. Pers."
B. I, c. 4) the following "wonderful story in relation to this subject":
"Sea-dogs are wonderful admirers of the pearl-fish, and follow them out
to sea. … A certain fisherman, having watched for the moment when the
shell-fish was deprived of the attention of its attendant sea-dog, …
seized the shell-fish and made for the shore. The sea-dog, however, was
soon aware of the theft, and making straight for the fisherman, seized
him. Finding himself thus caught, he made a last effort, and threw the
pearl-fish on shore, immediately on which he was torn to pieces by its
protector." <span id="fr_277"></span>[2](#fn_277.md)

Though the written record of this story is relatively modern the
incident thus described probably goes back to much more ancient times.
It is only a very slightly modified version of an ancient narrative of a
shark's attack upon a pearl-diver.

For reasons which 1 shall discuss in the following pages, the rôle of
the cowry and pearl as representatives of the Great Mother was in the
Levant assumed by the mandrake, just as we have already seen the
Southern Arabian conception of her as a tree adopted in Mycenæan lands.
Having replaced the sea-shell by a land plant it became necessary,

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

in adapting the legend, to substitute for the "sea-dog" some land
animal. Not unnaturally it became a dog. Thus the story of the dangers
incurred in the process of digging up a mandrake assumed the well-known
form. <span id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_278.md) The attempt to dig up the
mandrake was said to be fraught with great danger. The traditional means
of circumventing these risks has been described by many writers, ancient
and modern, and preserved in the folk-lore of most European and western
Asiatic countries. The story as told by Josephus is as follows: "They
dig a trench round it till the hidden part of the root is very small,
then they tie a dog to it, and when the dog tries hard to follow him
that tied him, this root is easily plucked up, but the dog dies
immediately, as it were, instead of the man that would take the plant
away". <span id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_279.md) Thus the dog takes the
place of the dog-fish when the mandrake becomes the pearl's surrogate.
The only discrepancy between the two stories is the point to which
Josephus calls specific attention. For instead of the dog killing the
thief, as the shark (dogfish) kills the stealer of pearls, the dog
becomes the victim as a substitute for the man. As Josephus remarks,
"the dog dies immediately, as it were, instead of the man that would
take the plant away". This distortion of the story is true to the
traditions of legend-making. The dog-incident is so twisted as to be
transformed into a device for plucking the dangerous plant without risk,

It is quite possible that earlier associations of the dog with the Great
Mother may have played some part in this transference of meaning, if
only by creating confusion which made such rationalization necessary. I
refer to the part played by Anubis in helping Isis to collect the
fragments of Osiris; and the role played by Anubis, and his Greek
*avatar* Cerberus, in the world of the dead. Whether the association of
the dog-star Sirius with Hathor had anything to do with the confusion is
uncertain. <span id="fr_280"></span>[3](#fn_280.md)

There was an intimate association of the dog with the goddess of

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

the underworld (Hecate) and the ritual of rebirth of the dead. <span
id="fr_281"></span>[1](#fn_281.md) Perhaps the development of the story of
the underworld-goddess Aphrodite's dog and the mandrake may have been
helped by this survival of the association of Isis with Anubis, even if
there is not a more definite causal relationship between the
dog-incidents in the various legends.

The divine dog Anubis is frequently represented in connexion with the
ritual of rebirth, <span id="fr_282"></span>[2](#fn_282.md) where it is
shown upon a standard in association with the placenta. The hieroglyphic
sign for the Egyptian word *mes*, "to give birth," consists of the skins
of three dogs (or jackals, or foxes). The three-headed dog Cerberus that
guarded the portal of Hades may possibly be a distorted survival of this
ancient symbolism of the three-fold dog-skin as the graphic sign for the
act of emergence from the portal of birth. Elsewhere (p. 223) in this
lecture I have referred to Charon's *obolus* as a surrogate of the
life-giving pearl or cowry placed in the mouth of the dead to provide
"vital substance". Rohde <span id="fr_283"></span>[3](#fn_283.md) regards
Charon as the second Cerberus, corresponding to the Egyptian dog-faced
god Anubis: just as Charon received his *obolus*, so in Attic custom the
dead were provided with μελιτοῦτια, the object of which is usually said
to be to pacify the dog of hell.

What seems to link all these fantastic beliefs and customs with the
story of the dog and the mandrake is the fact that they are closely
bound up with the conception of the dog as the guardian of hidden
treasure.

The mandrake story may have arisen out of a mingling of these two
streams of legend—the shark (dog-fish) protecting the treasures at the
bottom of the sea, and the ancient Egyptian beliefs concerning the
dog-headed god who presides at the embalmer's operations and
superintends the process of rebirth.

The dog of the story is a representative of the dragon guarding the
goddess in the form of the mandrake, just as the lions over the gate at
Mycenæ heraldically support her pillar-form, or the serpents in Southern
Arabia protect her as an incense tree. Dog, Lion, and

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Serpent in these
legends are all representatives of the goddess herself, *i.e.* merely
her own *avatars* ([Fig. 26](eod39.htm#img_fig26).md).

At one time I imagined that the rôle of Anubis as a god of embalming and
the restorer of the dead was merely an ingenuous device on the part of
the early Egyptians to console themselves for the depredations of
jackals in their cemeteries. For if the jackal were converted into a
life-giving god it would be a comforting thought to believe that the
dead man, even though devoured, was "in the bosom of his god" and
thereby had attained a rebirth in the hereafter. In ancient Persia
corpses were thrown out for the dogs to devour. There was also the
custom of leading a dog to the bed of a dying man who presented him with
food, just as Cerberus was given honey-cakes by Hercules in his journey
to hell. But I have not been able to obtain any corroboration of this
supposition. It is a remarkable coincidence that the Great Mother has
been identified with the necrophilic vulture as Mut; and it has been
claimed by some writers <span id="fr_284"></span>[1](#fn_284.md) that, just
as the jackal was regarded as a symbol of rebirth in Egypt and the dead
were exposed for dogs to devour in Persia, so the vulture's
corpse-devouring habits may have been primarily responsible for
suggesting its identification with the Great Mother and for the motive
behind the Indian practice of leaving the corpses of the dead for the
vultures to dispose of. <span id="fr_285"></span>[2](#fn_285.md) It is not
uncommon to find, even in English cathedrals, recumbent statues of
bishops with dogs as footstools. Petronius ("Sat.," c. 71) makes the
following statement: "valde te rogo, ut secundum pedes statuae meae
catellam pingas—ut mihi contingat tuo beneficio post mortem
vivere". <span id="fr_286"></span>[3](#fn_286.md) The belief in the dog's
service as a guide to the dead ranges from Western Europe to Peru.

To return to the story of the dog and the mandrake: no doubt the demand
will be made for further evidence that the mandrake actually assumed the
rôle of the pearl in these stories. If the remarkable

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

repertory of magical properties assigned to the mandrake <span
id="fr_287"></span>[1](#fn_287.md) be compared with those which developed
in connexion with the cowry and the pearl, <span
id="fr_288"></span>[2](#fn_288.md) it will be found that the two series are
identical. The mandrake also is the giver of life, of fertility to
women, of safety in childbirth; and like the cowry and the pearl it
exerts these magical influences only if it be worn in contact with the
wearer's skin. <span id="fr_289"></span>[3](#fn_289.md) But the most
definite indication of the mandrake's homology with the pearl is
provided by the legend that "it shines by night". Some scholars, <span
id="fr_290"></span>[4](#fn_290.md) both ancient and modern, have attempted
to rationalize this tradition by interpreting it as a reference to the
glow-worms that settle on the plant! But it is only one of many
attributes borrowed by the mandrake from the pearl, which was credited
with this remarkable reputation only when early scientists conceived the
hypothesis that the gem was a bit of moon substance.

As the memory of the real history of these beliefs grew dim, confusion
was rapidly introduced into the stories. I have already explained how
the diving for pearls started the story of the great palace of treasures
under the waters which was guarded by dragons. As the pearl had the
reputation of shining by night, it is not surprising that it or some of
its surrogates should in course of time come to be credited with the
power of "revealing hidden treasures," the treasures which in the
original story were the pearls themselves. Thus the magic fern-seed and
other treasure-disclosing vegetables <span
id="fr_291"></span>[5](#fn_291.md) are surrogates of the mandrake, and like
it derive their magical properties directly or indirectly from the
pearl.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

The fantastic story of the dog and the mandrake provides the most
definite evidence of the derivation of the mandrake-beliefs from the
shell-cults of the Erythræan Sea. There are many other scraps of
evidence to corroborate this. I shall refer here only to one of these.
"The discovery of the art of purple-dyeing has been attributed to the
Tyrian tutelary deity Melkart, who is identified with Baal by many
writers. According to Julius Pollux ('Onomasticon,' I, iv.) and Nonnus
('Dionys.,' XL, 306) Hercules (Melkart) was walking on the seashore
accompanied by his dog and a Tyrian nymph, of whom he was enamoured. The
dog having found a *Murex* with its head protruding from its shell,
devoured it, and thus its mouth became stained with purple. The nymph,
on seeing the beautiful colour, bargained with Hercules to provide her
with a robe of like splendour." <span id="fr_292"></span>[1](#fn_292.md)
This seems to be another variant of the same story.

for example, Shinji Nishimura, "The Hisago-Bune," Tokio, 1918, published
by the Tokio Society of Naval Architects, p. 18, where the dragon is
identified with the *wani*, which can be either a crocodile or a shark);
in Oceania (L. Frobenius, "Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes," Bd. I.,
1904, and C. E. Fox and F. H. Drew, "Beliefs and Tales of San

Honduras," *Nineteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American
Ethnology*, 1897-8, Part II, p. 661) the dragon assumes the form of a
shark, a crocodile, or a variety of other animals.

"Mycenæan Tree and Pillar Cult," *op. cit. supra:* W. Hayes Ward, "The
Seal Cylinders of Western Asia," *op. cit.:* and Robertson Smith, "The
Religion of the Semites," p. 133: "In [Hadramaut](errata.htm#7.md) it is
still dangerous to touch the sensitive mimosa, because the spirit that
resides in the plant will avenge the injury". When men interfere with
the incense trees it is reported: "the demons of the place flew away
with doleful cries in the shape of white serpents, and the intruders
died soon afterwards".

<span id="fn_274"></span>[159:1](eod35.htm#fr_274.md) Vide *supra*, [p.
38](eod11.htm#page_38.md).

<span id="fn_275"></span>[159:2](eod35.htm#fr_275.md) In Western mythology
the dragon guarding the fruit-bearing tree of life is also identified
with the Mother of Mankind (Campbell, "Celtic Dragon Myth," pp. xli and
18). Thus the tree and its defender are both surrogates of the Great
Mother. When Eve ate the apple from the tree of Paradise she was
committing an act of cannibalism, for the plant was only another form of
herself. Her "sin" consisted in aspiring to attain the immortality which
was the exclusive privilege of the gods. This incident is analogous to
that found in the Indian tales where mortals steal the amrita. By Eve's
sin "death came into the world" for the paradoxical reason that she had
eaten the food of the gods which gives immortality. The punishment meted
out to her by the Almighty seems to have been to inhibit the life-giving
and birth-facilitating action of the fruit of immortality, so that she
and all her progeny were doomed to be mortal and to suffer the pangs of
child-bearing.

There was a widespread belief among the ancients that ceremonies in
connexion with the gods must (to be efficacious) be done in the reverse
of the usual human way (Hopkins, "Religions of India," p. 201). So also
an act which gives immortality to the gods, brings death to man.

The full realization of the fact that man was mortal imposed upon the
early theologians the necessity of explaining the immortality of the
gods. The elixir of life was the food of the gods that conferred eternal
life upon them. By one of those paradoxes so dear to the maker of myths
this same elixir brought death to man.
