#### APHRODITE AS THE THUNDER-STONE.

As a surrogate of the Great Mother, the Eye of Re, the thunder-weapon
was also identified with any of her varied manifestations.

The thunderbolt is one of the manifestations of the life-giving and
death-dealing Divine Cow, and therefore is able specially to protect
mundane cows. <span id="fr_439"></span>[2](#fn_439.md)

There are numerous hints in the ancient literature of other countries in
confirmation of the association of the Great Mother with "falling
stars". "In a fragment of Sanchoniathon, Astarte, travelling about the
habitable world, is said to have found a star falling through the air,
which she took up and consecrated." <span
id="fr_440"></span>[3](#fn_440.md)

Aphrodite also was looked upon as a meteoric stone that fell from

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

the moon. In the "Iliad," Zeus is said to have sent Athena as a
meteorite from heaven to earth. <span id="fr_441"></span>[1](#fn_441.md)

The association of Aphrodite with meteoric stones and the ancient belief
that they fell from the moon serve to confirm the identification of
these life-giving and death-dealing objects with the pearl and the
thunderbolt. In Southern India the goddesses may be represented either
by small stones or by pots of water, usually seven in number. During the
ceremony around the stone-form of the goddess the *kappu-karan* runs
thrice around the stone, as the mandrake-digger does around the plant.
The *pujari* who represents the goddess is painted like a leopard
(Hathor's lioness) and kills the sacrificial sheep. The goddess (like
Hathor) is supposed to drink the blood of the sacrificial victims
(Whitehead, *op. cit.*, pp. 164-8).

Many factors played a part in the development of the beliefs about the
origin of mankind from stones, with which the identification of the
thunderbolt with the winged disk plays a part.

The idea that the cowry was the giver of life and the parent of men was
also transferred to crude stone imitations of the shell. Perhaps the
belief in such stones as creators of human beings may have been
reinforced by finding actual fossilized shells within pebbles. <span
id="fr_442"></span>[2](#fn_442.md)

A further corroboration of this theory was provided when the pearl came
to be regarded as the quintessence of the life-giving substance of
shells and as a little particle of moon-substance which fell as a drop
of dew into the gaping oyster. Perry (*op. cit.*, p. 78) refers to an
Indonesian belief among the Tsalisen that their ancestors came out of
the moon; and the chief of this people has a spherical stone which is
said to represent the moon.

This association of the moon with round stones may be connected with the
identification of the sun (as the winged disk) with a stone axe,

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

when they came to be regarded as alternative weapons for the destruction
or the creation of men. Perry records a story of a rock being lowered
down from the sun, from which it was born, and out of a cleft in it man
and woman emerged, as they were believed to have been born from the
cleft in the cowry.

Then there are the Egyptian beliefs concerning stone statues, obelisks,
or even unshaped blocks of stone which could be animated by human beings
or gods. <span id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_443.md)

The cycle of these stories was completed when the "Eye of Re"
slaughtered the enemies of the god and they became identified with the
followers of Set, "creatures of stone". Thus the evil eye petrified
rebellious men: and so was launched upon its course the peculiar group
of legends which in time encircled the world.

It is particularly significant that in Indonesia, in association with
these ideas about stone-origins and petrifaction, Perry (p. 133) found
also the clear-cut belief that the thunder-weapon was a stone, or the
tooth of a cloud-dragon in the sky.

In Indonesia also petrifaction, thunder-stones, rain, floods, lightning,
and an arrow shot to the accompaniment of thunder and lightning were the
punishments traditionally assigned for certain offences, such as incest
and laughing at animals.

The same people who introduced into the Malay Archipelago these
characteristic fragments of the dragon-myth also believed that certain
animals were impersonations of their gods: they also brought stories of
incestuous unions on the part of their deities and rulers. To laugh at
their sacred animals, or to imitate privileged customs permitted to
their deities, but not to ordinary mortals, merited the same sort of
punishments as were meted out to those other rebels against the ruling
class and the gods in the home of these beliefs. <span
id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_444.md)

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

To laugh at the divine animals, or to commit incest, which was a divine
prerogative, was analogous to "the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost,"
which in the New Testament is proclaimed an unpardonable offence, and in
pagan legend was punished by the divine wrath, thunder, lightning, rain,
floods, or petrifaction being the avenging instruments. Œdipus put out
his own eyes to forestall the traditional wrath of the gods.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[226:2](eod45.htm#fr_442.md) Striking examples of
these stories about birth from split stones have been given by Perry,
"Megalithic Culture of Indonesia," Chapter X, and de Groot's "Religious
System of China". It is possible that the double meaning of the Egyptian
word set, as "stone" and "mountain" played a part in originating these
stories. I have already quoted from the Pyramid Texts the account of the
daily birth of the sun-god by a splitting of the "mountain" of the dawn.
By a pun on this word the god's origin might have been interpreted as
having taken place from a split "stone". The fact that the Great Mother
was identified with a "mountain" (*set*) may also have facilitated the
homology with the of the other meaning of *set*, *i.e.* "a stone".

<span id="fn_443"></span>[227:1](eod45.htm#fr_443.md) "Incense and
Libations".

<span id="fn_444"></span>[227:2](eod45.htm#fr_444.md) As the character and
attributes of the early goddesses became more complex, and contradictory
traits were more sharply contrasted, the inevitable tendency developed
to differentiate the goddesses themselves, and provide distinctive names
for the new personalities thus split off from the common parent. We see
this in Egypt in the case of Hathor and Sekhet, and in Babylonia in
Ishtar and Tiamat. But the process of specialization and differentiation
might even involve a change of sex. There can be no doubt that the *god*
Horus was originally a differentiation of certain of the aspects of the
sky-goddess Hathor, at first as a brother "Eye". But as the king Horus
was the son of Osiris (as the dead king), when the confusion of the
attributes <span id="page_228">p. 228</span> of Osiris and Hathor—the
actual father and the divine mother of Horus—made their marriage
inevitable, the maternal relationship of the goddess to her "brother"
was emphasized. But as the Great Mother, Hathor was the parent of the
universe, and the mother not only of Horus but also of his father
Osiris. This complicated rationalization made Hathor the sister, mother,
and grandmother of Horus, and was responsible for originating the belief
in the incestuous practices of the divine family. When the royal family
assumed the rôle of gods and goddesses they were bound by these
traditions (which had their origin purely in theological sophistry) and
were driven to indulge in actual incest, as we know from the records of
the Egyptian royal family and their imitators in other countries. But
incest became a royal and divine prerogative which was sternly forbidden
to mere mortals and regarded as a peculiarly detestable sin.
