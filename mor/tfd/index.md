# Tenderfoot Days

### George Robert Bird

#### \[1918\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a memoir by a non-Mormon about his experiences in the
prospecting camps of Utah at the turn of the 19th century. It was
donated to sacred-texts by the anonymous volunteer who goes by the name
of 'Some Dude'. This is a first-person perspective by an outsider to the
then newly minted state of Utah, which gives both a sympathetic account
of the Mormons, while bringing up some darker aspects about their
history. He also presents a stereotypical portrayal of the Native
Americans of the region. As always, we encourage readers to consider the
historical context in which this book was written, as well as retain a
critical point of view.
