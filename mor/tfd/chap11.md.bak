# CHAPTER XI

# THE CREED THAT CAUSED THE DEED

*"So many gods, so many creeds! So many paths that wind and wind, When
just the art of being kind Is all this sad world needs."*

*Ella Wheeler Wilcox*

THE shot does not leave the gun unless there is a powder charge behind
it. The things which I have noted before and behind the Curtain of
Events in Utah, could not arise without a sufficient cause.  
  
That cause is found in the creed of the people who settled the Territory
while yet a wilderness, the hunting ground of nomadic Indians.  
  
A history of world populations records the shedding of much human blood
at the behest of creeds. It is the easy mistake of earnest faith to
follow the path of intemperate zeal. Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Greece, and
Rome, as nations, saw the priests of religion offering the blood of
human beings to the gods, on splendidly built , altars. The same is true
of the New World. Cortez and his men-at-arms, great shedders of human
blood, beheld the Aztecs of Anahuac, ancient Mexico, offering human
sacrifices at the altars' steps; yet these Spaniards in the retreat of
"Noche Triste," the Doleful Night, shed as much blood of the Aztecs as
religion had done in a score of years; since that older Doleful Night,
when Caiphas, the High Priest, spoke concerning Jesus of Nazareth, "It
is expedient that one man die for the people."  
  
In every land and clime, human blood has been offered in religious
sacrifice. In Jewish ancient days, in Classic days, in the days of Nero,
in those of the Inquisition, in Auto-da-Fe's, on St. Bartholomew's Eve
in Paris, at Smithfield fires in London, in Protestant and Catholic
revenges, in Florida and Louisiana,-on to the days of the Missouri
mob-violence, when the two Mormon Smiths fell, the holocaust of blood
for religion's sake was continuous, until the slaughter in the lonely
wastes of Southern Utah showed the error of it all.  
  
To use a theologic term, the Mormon creed is Anthropomorphic. It teaches
a materialized Deity with body, parts and passions as a man. Here we
have the key to this creed of strangely mixed theory and practice. I do
not go into the matter of the credibility and genuineness of the Mormon
books of belief. A war of words has raged since 1827, and there is no
need of another syllable on the thread-bare subject. What I say here I
have gathered from the printed sermons of such leaders as Brigham Young,
Orson Pratt, Heber C. Kimball, Orson Hyde, and Lorenzo Snow; all
discourses published by the press of the Mormon Church, between 1855 and
1860, in Salt Lake City. In these discourses I found the doctrines
really preached to, and accepted by, the people. These rough, and often
rude, pulpit teachings were subsequently withdrawn by the Church
authorities at Salt Lake, and at the time of my sojourn in Utah, it was
difficult to purchase the volumes. However, a friend of mine in Provo, a
county seat overlooking Lake Utah, loaned four of the volumes to me for
examination, but would not sell them at any price, and after returning
them I was unable to secure other copies. As I remember these sermons to
the people, they seemed to teach that Adam was the only God of this
world; and he was also the God of Jesus Christ. It was admitted that
Christ had a previous era before appearing in this world, and that he is
to have a future era of Millennial Triumph in Salt Lake City. This is
affirmed with strength.  
  
There is a strong tinge of Millennialism and of modern Russellism in
these teachings. But Christ is as God to Joseph Smith, and so this first
prophet of the Faith called the Church he established "The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints." Now follows the nut of all this. It
is this. That Joseph Smith is the god of this generation of men, and so
the Latter Day Saint regards his assassination with the same feeling
that orthodox Christians regard the crucifixion of Christ by the Jews.  
  
According to these sermons, Joseph Smith, when living in Wayne County,
New York State, was visited by the angel Moroni, son of the prophet
Mormon, who revealed to him the ancient history of America. He showed
him the written plates, whose hieroglyphics were interpreted by the
stones, called the Urim and Thum-mim.  
  
He learned that America was first peopled by Noah, and later by the
family of Lehi, a remnant of the Jews who had escaped from captivity m
the days of King Zedekiah. These came across to Chili, and then traveled
north by the Pacific coast, and so became the progenitors of the
Red-men. Eras of faith and apostasy followed to the year before Christ
500, when the prophet Mormon was slain, and these record plates were
hidden in the hill Cumorah in Wayne County, there to remain until time
was ripe to reveal them to Joseph Smith by the visit of the angel
Moroni. This angel further revealed that this book of Mormon was to be
added to the scriptures of the Old and New Testament. The Faith, founded
on the whole of these books, was to be preached until the Millennial
Dawn of Christ's Triumph. This Triumph should be reached in the interior
of North America, in the tops of the mountains. Moreover this Latter Day
Faith was to be the recipient of everyday revelation from Heaven to its
leaders. As an organization, it was to include all the ancient orders of
priesthood.  
  
It had two kinds of priesthood: The Melchi-zedek, which included the
Prophet, the First Patriarch, the Twelve Apostles, the Seventy
Councillors, and the whole body of the High Priests; and the Aaronic
priesthood which included the Bishops, Lower order of priests, the
Elders, Deacons, and Ward Teachers without number.  
  
When I was a resident of Utah, it was claimed that there were 7,234
religious offices in the Church, whose membership was then estimated at
100,000 people. This creed claimed to possess the powers of revelation,
inspiration, miracles, prophecy, visions, tongues, and healing gifts.
All these were in active use, and all this was supposed to be resident
in Salt Lake City in the Church, called the "Latter Day Saints."  
  
You can see at once how unlike any other new western city this one was.
It was another Jerusalem brought down to date. Welded to these strange
doctrines and excessive claims, were the following very practical, and
sensible teachings:-  
  
"We believe in being honest, virtuous, and upright; in doing good to all
men, and that an idle or lazy person cannot be a Christian nor have
salvation." You see in this the powder that had explosive force enough
to make a telling shot, with the multitude of half taught and visionary
people found all over the world of to-day.  
  
There is no place here for the grafter, the boodler, the promoter, the
liar, the bum and the tramp. In fact I did not find that type of
humanity among the Mormons. I had to go into the gentile mining camps to
come across that kind of human trash. If my reader wants a full,
detailed account of this strange faith, let him read one of the many
worthy and competent authors who go into this subject exhaustively, such
as Burton, Robinson, Dickson and Stenhouse.  
  
Polygamy, so prominent, when I was in Utah, was really an afterthought
of this faith, and came into prominence through Brigham Young, as a new
revelation in 1857.  
  
The two Smiths, Joseph and Hyrum, the martyrs to Missourian violence,
did not proclaim polygamy or practice it, if their family descendants
are to be credited. The Josephite branch of the Mormon Church repudiates
the doctrine, and the practice to this day.  
  
So much in the Bible seems to condone if not permit polygamy from the
days of Abraham, the father of the Jewish race, with his Hagar as well
as Sarah for a wife; to the times of Jacob-and his concubines with two
sisters for wives. Then uxorious David and his still more wived son
Solomon, whose glory so much bespoken was not seemingly dimmed by his
harem of one thousand concubines.  
  
It is not to be wondered at, that a certain type of mankind should
revive the polygamy of the ancient world, give it standing by claiming a
revelation permitting it among the faithful, in order to build up Zion
with a seed of true believers.  
  
It was not so difficult for a born leader and master of assemblies like
Brigham Young to rivet this practice on a credulous people. He saw if he
succeeded in getting a good many good people and leading men committed
to this practice, that he had them bound tight in a bundle of life from
which there was no escape and which would make them stick together
against all opposition.  
  
He saw how it would make the people singular, and keep them intact from
the seductions of the world. He saw that it would prevent the social
evil of great cities, and, as a matter of fact, Utah had no white
slavers in those days.  
  
He knew the Moslem element was strong in many men, that a sensualistic
God and carnal pleasures as a reward would win with such men, where the
more spiritual and monastic teachings of historic Christianity failed.  
  
So with these factors at work, and the apparent sanction of Old
Testament scripture, to give authority to a new revelation, Brigham
Young, a genius for religious leadership, proclaimed polygamy as a
doctrine of the Latter Day Church.  
  
*Yet polygamy has its horrors, and they were constantly out-cropping in
domestic circles.*  
  
I will relate a few instances that came under my eyes.  
  
While staying in American Fork, I met Professor Orbs, of the town
schools. This school covered the educational ground from the elementary
to the academic. It was all under one roof. The higher branches were but
poorly attended. The young men and young women could not come regularly
to the school, since their services were more needed in the homes and
the fields. Orbs was a scholar, and a graduate of old Bowdoin College.
After the Civil War was over, he went west like many of the enterprising
young men of that period. He was finally invited to teach in Utah
Territory, and was offered a principalship by the Mormon church
authorities. He was not then an announced convert, and his wife, to whom
he had been married only a few years, made him promise solemnly never to
become a Mormon. On his agreeing to this, his wife consented to go to
the Territory.  
  
When I knew them, they had been in the Territory some ten years, and
Professor Orbs was ranking high among the Mormons as one of them. He had
not kept faith with his wife, and she was full of fears about the
future. They then had four children.  
  
Mrs. Orbs came to me one day in great mental distress.  
  
"My husband is really going into polygamy."  
  
The tears were in both eyes and voice.  
  
"He promised me years ago never to do it. Now the Church authorities
have pursuaded him. He says it is a step up, and will better his
finances. Oh! will you not go and see him; urge him to give up this
thing?"  
  
"He is not sincere in thinking it his duty, is he?"  
  
"He says he is, but the girl he is going to take is but eighteen, and
has been one of his scholars. She thinks it is a promotion to be a wife
of a professor."  
  
I did all that I could to comfort the poor lady and promised to see her
husband. I did this some days later. He was quite abrupt with me, and
said:  
  
"I think that this is no matter of yours. Our Church believes in plural
marriage. It is my own matter."  
  
I could see at a glance he was fully committed to grieve his wife. It
was the old incentive. A new young wife was attractive to a middle-aged
man. He was ready to put aside his promise, the society of his faithful
wife, the children she had raised in their home. The rosy young girl,
offered him by the Church, was irresistible to a mind coarsened by the
Mormon inoculation.  
  
The next I knew of him was a new house he had built for the new wife,
adjoining his family home. He left for Salt Lake City, and the Endowment
House, where he went through the ritual of taking another wife, and
returned with her, and the Church's approval of living his religion.  
  
His wife was broken-hearted, and the condolences of other polygamous
women did not give her any comfort, since she was not of Mormon stock,
and kept intact her old Eastern views of life.  
  
Eliza Snow came down with several of her associates. She was the great
woman of this social horror. In public she spoke eloquently in its
favor. Quoted the Old Testament times, and characters. She trotted out
Abraham, Jacob, David and Solomon, all men approved of God she said, and
whose polygamous children became the ancestors of Israel.  
  
"There is a higher exaltation for the women who aid in building up Zion;
who do their zealous part to populate this territory for the Saints.  
  
"We must occupy the land. We must keep out the Gentiles. We must give
him no place of rest for the sole of his foot. Women only fulfill their
end when they bear many children. Children are the great asset of the
Church. It is the prophecy of the scripture that 'in Zion the streets
shall be full of boys and girls playing.' "  
  
Such teaching as this was given to, and received by, a great audience in
every town on Eliza Snow's tour, in the interests of polygamy. I was
surprised at the audiences she drew.  
  
My early opinion, that all women were opposed instinctively to this
doctrinal horror, was upset when I heard these leaders, among the women
of the territory, thus advocating polygamous marriages. They were women
of good education and were apparently refined, both in their manner of
speech and dress.  
  
I felt sure that if it had not been received so meekly, and willingly by
the women of the Church, and if it had been stoutly and socially
resisted by them as a body, that the practice of polygamy would never
have existed in the Mormon Church.  
  
That Church would then have stood on the same basis for criticism as
those other religious denominations of America, that meet with no overt
opposition or persecution. By this doctrine it stands alone, singular,
as an anachronism; as a reversion to the type of Old Testament days, and
is unfit for a place in these later days of higher ideals for women.  
  
While I was in San Pete County, I called at the residence of the Bishop
of Mount Pleasant. It was not a pleasant errand I was on. It was to make
complaint of the hoodlumism of the youth, supposed to be under his
control, in stone throwing at the hall where the Liberal school, and its
meetings were held.  
  
The Bishop was not an imposing sight. There was nothing stately about
him, nor did he wear anything like canonical robes, such as we associate
with the historic bishop. He was in his shirt sleeves with slop pants
and was carrying swill for his pigs. He was evidently an industrious
man, a practical character. He had need to be. His house was wide and
big in style, since his family was large. He had five wives and fifteen
children, and there was, of course, a financial side to this
establishment, which made the Bishop a rustler.  
  
While I talked, I stood before the front porch, which was a long, low
screened affair, shadowing the whole front of the house. There were dark
shadowy corners in it, but not sufficiently dark to hide the array of
womankind seated along its length. Five women occupied as many chairs,
all busy with their hands at woman's tasks. All, did I say? No, I must
omit the fifth, the youngest looking, who had nothing to do but look
about. She also was the best dressed. She evidently was . the favorite
wife of the Bishop.  
  
The oldest woman was grey, with eyes that had in them a look of shyness,
as well as pain. What a history those eyes had seen in that household.
She was the wife of the Bishop's youth, and by her age she must have
seen something of the earlier history of the territory.  
  
The other three women were stout and healthy looking and graded in their
ages from the first to the last wife; for no new wife, added to the
Mormon household, is older than her predecessor on the polygamous list.
This is so common, that it is of the nature of a rule. It is the way
also of human nature, the way of the world, and may I say, the way of
foolish womankind; for without woman's consent, this matrimonial horror
could not exist in a land of laws and freedom.  
  
The wonder to me was the placidity of these wives. The situation was
accepted. What Moslem ideas were growing up among the younger
generation, as they advanced in years and became familiar with such a
scene as I have described. They had to recognize, from their infancy
almost, the many mothers of a Mormon home. There was no fear of racial
suicide in these houses. Children were all around, playing in the dust,
before their homes, or out on the squares or streets of the town, in
fact visible everywhere.  
  
The advocates of polygamy claim that for health and growth they outdo
the children of monogamy, since they say that the mothers have more time
and leisure to fulfill their maternity.  
  
It is a subject that has its physical and medical side, as well as its
sociological one, but hardly fit for discussion in a popular book for
all sorts of readers. I must say that I never saw healthier, sturdier
young ones than the Utah children.  
  
Of course the splendid climate and the air of these valleys, sheltered
from the chilly blasts of the eastern Rockies, with easy temperatures
and generous sunlight, accounted for much of the rude health that I
saw.  
  
Also the outdoor life and the frugal food, due to limited circumstances,
together with the active labor in the gardens and the field, from early
childhood, wrote health on the cheeks, put good blood into the arteries,
and a firelight and snap into their eyes. Yet I also saw how this
anomalous state of matrimony coarsened the speech and habits of young
Utah, both girls as well as boys.
