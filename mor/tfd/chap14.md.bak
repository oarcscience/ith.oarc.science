# CHAPTER XIV

# THE OLD PROSPECTOR

*"Riches certainly make themselves wings"*

*Proverbs*

THE prospector is the man that makes mining possible. It is his
enterprise, his everlasting faith in prospects, his nerve and calm
courage, that does the trick. He casts a charm about lone grey hills
whose land value is about "two bits" per square mile, the price of a
California miner's drink. He rambles in the chaparral, sage brush; and
is familiar with the owl's hoot, the coyote's howl, and the rattler's
hiss. But he enjoys his tin can repast, over a stick fire, amid such
scenes; since he lives expectant that a stumble of his foot may unearth
rich rock, that will give rise to a camp to be known by his name as the
discoverer. Red Dick was such a man. I met him on the slope of the
Little Cottonwood Canyon one hot afternoon in July. In midsummer the
granite walls of this canyon absorb the sun's rays, and the flinty rocks
reflect this heat from side to side. The bed of the canyon is at furnace
heat during mid-day, only cooling with the evening breeze.  
  
Red Dick was wiping the sweat from a very rubicund face with an old red
kerchief, which he wore loose about his lean red neck: the red flannel
shirt tucked into his old pants accentuated his color characteristics,
and the afternoon's heat. He was spitting and swearing, when I came up
to him, on the trail to Alta City. His bottle was broken, for a slip
from his hand just as he lifted it, had let it fall on a sharp flint at
his feet. I saw disappointment on the face of a thirsty and bibulous
man. It was not water he had lost, but the favorite old rye whiskey in
common use, and this gave greater volubility to his strong words. Strong
waters always beget words under the stress of excitement.  
  
"Say, Stranger, this is tough luck! Lost my drink just at the lip!"  
  
He eyed me anxiously, with the evident hope that I had something
stimulating hidden in my pocket. Well, I had. It was not whiskey for I
cannot drink the stuff. I wonder that so many men like its flavour. But
I like wine, for my ancestors all drank it at meals, and I had been
accustomed to its use, in that way, from the days of my youth. I always
thought of wine, beer, or ale as a beverage to be used as one uses milk,
tea, coffee, or water to quench thirst agreeably.  
  
It was not a temperance age or locality, and a strong drink was
something everybody took, or expected to take on a suitable occasion.
What I had was a flask of wine, some old Port, as a cordial for the body
when overtaxed or chilled.  
  
"Here is something as good as what you have lost," I handed my flask to
him, with a smile. He eyed it and myself, and grinned in a friendly way.
Next he tilted it to his dry mouth, and shut his eyes while its contents
gurgled down his long red throat, his Adam's apple working vigorously.
He was a gentleman, he knew when to stop. He took a good drink as he
knew' I wished him to, but he left me half the contents, wiped the flask
with his sleeve, and handed it back.  
  
"Good stuff if it is wine! It hit the right spot at this pertickeler
time."  
  
I saw that he was a character, and was a promising find for a good
story, so I set out to interview him, like a reporter.  
  
As to outfit, he was evidently down to bedrock. A miner in luck is well,
though roughly dressed. This man had no coat, a very dirty shirt and
hat; while his overalls were held up by one lone suspender. His boots,
of course, were well down at the heel, and almost open at the toes. Held
by a thin rope across his chest, his bundle of blankets hung under his
arm. They were as well worn as his clothes. He had tobacco and a pipe,
for these implements of the solitary came into sight straightway after
the drink, and he filled up and asked for a match. Soon the smoke was
on, and I saw that he was ready for a yarn, and so at it I went.  
  
"Yes, I'm down, but I'm not out, pardner! You can see that without my
saying it. I've been down many a time, but never quite out. Some day
I'll finish in luck or out of it; for this life is a strange deal to
some of us. Say! I've known the day when I wore good clothes like yours.
I got a bit of an education to start with, so I knew something about
chemicals and assay work. Yes! I'm an old Californian, and just missed
being a forty-niner. I was on the American River back of Sacramento, in
the early days, and panned out a heap of gold dirt in those placer
diggin's. Yes! I struck it rich there, but lost most of my pile when I
visited Frisco with a bunch of the boys. But I had a good time, you
bet!  
  
"No! never thought, in those days, of settling down, or going into
business. You see! those times were pretty free, and the dust came easy
from the sands and rocks. We thought it would never let up, but just go
on that way; so what was the use of saving the dust? Well! once I did
buy a place. A poor fellow had made a farm out of some flat bottom land
on the Yuba River near Marysville. He wanted to go East to see his
folks, as he was on his last legs, being a one-lunger. I had coin then,
and he hit me in a soft spot I have at times. So I bought him out. You
never saw a feller so glad as this poor guy, when he had my wad.  
  
"Well! I had a ranch on my hands, and a mighty fine vineyard too. I had
stock and tools; a house and barn. In fact the whole outfit was there.
The boys plagued me to marry a widow who had five kids of her own. She
kept a feeding house in Marysville, and the boys said it was a duty I
owed society to hitch up with her. Well! I didn't do it. I wasn't a
marrying sort in those days. I might have done it once back where I came
from. I ain't going to say where that was. That's all closed,-final. But
she was cattish, and turned me down in a pet. So I felt very sore, and I
ain't got over it yet.  
  
"My ranch was a bother to me, for I didn't know a thing about farming. I
like roving, and this thing called for settling down. What d'ye think
settled it? The Yuba River!  
  
"There came a flood such as you don't often see. The whole Sacramento
Valley looked like a lake for weeks, and my ranch was washed clean off
the earth by the time the water went down. You never saw such rain,
about like it was when Noah went into the ark. Of course my ground
showed up after the freshit, but there wasn't a thing on it, but mud and
rocks, with some stranded logs and timber. House, vineyard, crops, stock
all gone. So I let it slide, since the Yuba River had changed its
course, and ran partly over my land.  
  
"I wasn't pertickler sorry for I itched to get at a pick again. So the
old life went on. Flush one year and busted the next. Went with the rush
to every new diggin's, till I got the rhumaticks bad and had to quit for
a time.  
  
"Well! I set up a sort of resort at Stockton, which I bought with some
coin I had left. I fed the travellers on the road to the mines. I
liquored them at a bar, and let them gamble in my back room. You bet I
was popular. This sort of thing did for a while, till a town fire burned
out the whole side of the street, and my outfit went up in smoke.  
  
"No insurance? Of course not. We weren't that careful in those days.
Bedrock again. Then I joined a band of rangers to run out the cattle
thieves, and greaser bandits, which were playing hob with the valley
folks. In one hot scrimmage I got a ball in the thigh that stopped horse
riding for good, and brought back my old rhumatiks.  
  
"I was in a hospital in Frisco for about five months, with one thing and
another. The Doc treated me fine, but shot an awful lot of stuff into my
stummick in that length of time.  
  
"I came out thin as a lath, but full of go. I went mining again, this
time in quartz rock, on the Mother Lode, at Sonora town. It was shaft
sinking, and I worked for pay, not for prospects. I kept right poor, for
it always took the whole of my wages to live. D'ye notice that's the way
with a salary man, he can't save a bean, for the life of him?  
  
"Think of old age? No, never crossed my mind once 'til one day in a
barber shop I saw I was gettin' grey and bald. You see I come of a stock
that frosts early at top.  
  
"Then came the Colorado rush, and it carried me right off my feet so to
speak. A mining rush always took with me. I joined a party of surveyors,
and we put through the desert for Denver. If I was a writer I could fill
a book with stuff about that trip. I tell you we saw some awful things;
but to go on with this truthful yarn, pard-ner, I prospected at Fairplay
and Cripple Creek. But, Lord! it wasn't like the old diggin's on the
Feather and Yuba Rivers above Marysville. No?  
  
Californey's the mining ground for me. It took just four years to get
foot-loose, and back to the coast; as far as this derned Mormon country.
Say! I've just left them Emma Mine fellers, they are sports, all right;
but no good at cheating, like them Yankee sharpers that sold them that
salted claim at such a Bonanza figure. Yes! I'm on my way to Frisco, but
I'm to try Bingham on this lap. Anything doing over there, pardner?"  
  
I have put his story in, almost without a break, but I had to question
him, at times, to keep him going, in my endeavor to get his life
story.  
  
He was evidently nearing the age of sixty, and I suppose, this old
prospector would go on in his way of life, till some day he would go
over the "divide," with about the same possessions he had when he came
into this strange life.  
  
Looking at it in a broad spirit, would he not be as well-to-do, as the
man of millions, who, in dying, leaves his wealth behind for his sons to
squander, or his relatives to fight over?  
  
Rolling stones gather no moss was written on his face, and would be the
fitting epitaph over his worn body, when it occupied the only piece of
ground that he would own, when-Life's fitful dream was over.  
  
We exchanged a few things. He gave me some odd specimens out of his
pocket, and I gave him a few supplies from my travelling bag; for I was
horseback, riding old Blueskin, a veteran canyon horse, on my way to
Alta City.  
  
The last I saw of him was his ragged hat, bobbing above some rocky
points, as he swung around a bend in the trail, going down hill to the
valley below, like a thousand more men of this strange, strident, virile
breed of prospectors. He was a fair type of a set of men without whom
the great Rocky West could not have been opened to settlement,
railroads, and commerce.  
  
It was a long uphill ride to Alta City, with frowning walls high on
either hand. Turn after turn was passed, till at last we struck the snow
level, a little short of nine thousand feet altitude. I stopped awhile
at a wayside restaurant, kept by a dapper little woman and her midget of
a husband. She gave me a meal for a dollar,-one egg, two soda biscuits,
a dab of butter, two "corn pancakes with a little syrup in a dirty
glass, a cup of coffee-of rather a washy kind-for my outlay. She said
"vittles was dear as freight was high."  
  
She was proud of her husband, dubbed him "her man," and asked me if I
did not think him a "proper sort," as he went out the back to hack at
some sticks for the fire. He seemed so obedient that the big black cigar
in his mouth looked out of place. She said that it was his "only
failing," and that a man ought to have some bad habits to make him "real
nice."  
  
Refreshed, and my horse fed at about the same cost as for my own food, I
left the happy couple of this upper world life to their restaurant and
its charms. By nightfall, I reached the camp, just as the lights began
to sparkle in the windows of the buildings along the one main street.  
  
I had a letter to an ex-Mormon elder. He was in business, carrying
everything in his store that could be wanted in such a place. He slept
in a little recess at the rear of the store; where he had an equally
small kitchen. I know that we two barely found room to sit down at a
table, hinged to the wall. He was hospitable and said I could sleep on a
shelf about three feet wide, under some blankets. He started supper,
first wiping out his frying pan with some old copies of the *Salt Lake
Tribune*. He said that it was sanitary, and beat a dish cloth, since you
could use the paper afterward to start a fire. He pounded some tough
meat tender, he slushed his knives and forks in some hot but greasy
water, and laid them wet by equally wet plates which had been washed in
the same manner as the knives and forks. He put on a whole roll of
butter and a lot of sad looking soda biscuits. Meanwhile the meat
frizzled and some potatoes boiled. We had coffee out of a big black can,
that had stood heat and smoke of many fires, but as it was strong and
hot, it went down. He had some condensed milk, then a new thing, and of
which he was very proud. Brown sugar did the sweetening. Being polite, I
ate as he did, and made no comments. Still I enjoyed this evening meal
more than I did the mid-day dinner at the restaurant on Main street the
next day; for I unfortunately passed through the kitchen at the wrong
moment, wishing to dry a couple of handkerchiefs at the big stove.
Looking around I was in time to see the Chinese cook in the pantry
making biscuits, and spraying the nicely assorted nascent bread with his
mouth in Chinese laundry style.  
  
That let me out. I never touched biscuit-bread again in that camp, or in
any other. I had either pancakes or loaf bread. Still John did this in a
most innocent, matter-of-fact manner that made me certain that it was
the procedure in the preparation of biscuit, by all such oriental
cooks.  
  
My host of the evening was a bright and clever man. He had a fine mind,
and so as we got onto the subject of the Mormons and his departure from
them, we had a good talk on philosophy. He was an advocate of the old
idea of holding your life views of religion, or aught else that was
metaphysical, in an exoteric manner to suit the multitude, and an
esoteric manner to suit yourself. That meant if it were popular and
profitable, go with the majority externally, but mentally hold your own
view internally and subjectively. In fact, be a hypocrite if necessary,
but do not give yourself away, if you change your opinion.  
  
"Well if this is right?" I said, "why did you leave the Mormons?"  
  
"Well, I joined them because I had to; it was policy and it was safe.
You understand that I left because I could leave them safe, since Uncle
Sam was here, and I did not like their views."  
  
"Oh! You left them because of polygamy, I suppose."  
  
"No. I could be a polygamist, if it paid to go into that condition; but
not if I had to face poverty and feed a lot of mouths. It's not a moral
question with me at all. Some are born to be polygamous, and it is safer
for them and their morals to have several wives. No! I saw more money in
these mines, and no way of making it if I stayed under the great Co-op.
I am running a Co-op of my own right here."  
  
"Well! when you get rich, what then?"  
  
"The world is wide, and I will find a nicer nest than rough camps and
these loud-mouthed miners. There are Art and Literary centers in Europe
where one could live, if one had money."  
  
This educated freethinker had some willowy principles as the outcome of
his hankey-pankey playing with this "exoteric" and "esoteric" philosophy
applied to common every-day life.  
  
Coming down from this mining aerie is no tax on heart, but it is upon
the heels, I left my old horse, Blueskin for his owner to bring down
later, and took the trail afoot, since I had to connect with the
narrow-gauge railroad at the depot eight miles below. At first over the
snow it was easy going. Although it was June there was snow at this
altitude, but as soon as I passed below the snow line, I struck the ties
of the tram-cars. Mules took the place of the locomotive, as the grade
was five hundred feet to the mile, too steep for steam. The mule cars
had gone already and I soon got into trouble with my heels. I had to
hurry, and so it was pound-pound steadily down grade, my heels hitting
the ties at every step. I forgot the consequences of such foot-work.
Eight miles of this at top-speed and I made the train. I also made some
"tender-feet" too. The next day I was on my back, due to contracted
lumbar muscles, from this severe jarring of the heels upon the ties. The
boys in camp laughingly called it a tenderloin spine. It was three days
before I could walk erect.  
  
While in Alta City I heard of a miner's easy death. He was a veteran,
and was ascending to his work at one of the highest mines in the range.
The trail was long and winding, and the air was thin at that great
height. Out of breath, he sat to rest on a jutting rock, a short
distance below the mine tunnel. From weariness he sighed, and as he did
so he expired. His breath came out, but none returned.  
  
"His heart but once heaved, and forever grew still."  
  
This camp has suffered from snowslides. A wholesale tragedy of this kind
occurred the winter before my arrival. The food and ammunition for the
mines, in the winter go up the trail- on pack mules or freight sleds.
This is slow climbing. It is along a trail constantly covered by heavy
snows, and swept by avalanches from higher points. The trail is too
narrow to allow a team to turn round, and there are only occasional
places where the width permits teams to pass each other. There is no
chance to increase speed beyond an unsteady plod. In March a surface
thaw had occurred, due to a wandering Chinook wind from Oregon. A heavy
frost had followed. Then on this slippery surface a heavy coat of snow
had fallen when Old Winter had shouted "I've not done with that camp
yet." A heavy deposit resting on such a slippery surface needed only a
jar to start a slide. It was this oft recurring condition that gave to
the gulch, where this tragedy happened, the name of "Dead Man's Gulch."
Nineteen freight sleds, with as many men and teams, were slowly passing
the mouth of this gulch. The leading teamster was watching the crest of
the gulch, and saw the first signs of a slide, "the snow-smoke."
Instantly he yelled, "A slide! A slide! Whip up, Boys!" Whips cracked
and mules struggled forward, the drivers looking up, with no more time
than for a look. With an increasing roar, the whole slope seemed to
start to life, and swept downward. Snow, rocks, trees, mixed in wildest
tumult, formed an awful front which swept on, and over the trail. A
moment later nothing was left of the long line of freighters but the
leading team. The driver was the only living one to see this slide pile
up in the bottom of the canyon, the avalanche missing him by a few
yards. With his heart in his mouth, he pushed on, to Alta City, to
report the loss of all the others. Buried a hundred feet deep they were
hidden until the July sun, melting the snow, exposed the wreck of men,
animals, and goods.  
  
Another danger beset the traveller in this canyon. Near the entrance,
and where the junction of the locomotive railroad and the mule
tram-cars  
  
occurred, was a mass of giant granite blocks fallen from the towering
cliffs. Some were as big as a house, others sharp-pointed like a tooth,
while more looked like huge pieces of cube sugar, so square were they.
These being accessible to the railroad, they were being worked up by the
masons for the walls of the Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City. Asleep on
these blocks and about the crevasses were hosts of great rattle snakes,
so numerous that in the heat of summer you could detect their peculiar
odor as you passed by. A notice, with the legend "Be careful," was
erected here for the safety of all travellers. A good deal of revolver
practice took place here; the miners' enjoying the sport of shooting off
the heads of these reptiles as they lay sunning themselves on the rocks.
I have seen the stage driver, with his skill-ful whip, almost cut off
the heads of some rattlers near-by as we passed up the grade.
