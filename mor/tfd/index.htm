This is a memoir by a non-Mormon about his experiences in the
prospecting camps of Utah at the turn of the 19th century.
It was donated to sacred-texts by the anonymous volunteer who
goes by the name of 'Some Dude'.
This is a first-person perspective by an outsider to the then newly
minted state of Utah, which gives both a sympathetic account of
the Mormons, while bringing up some darker aspects about their history.
He also presents a stereotypical portrayal of the Native Americans
of the region.
As always, we encourage readers to consider the historical
context in which this book was written,
as well as retain a critical point of view.
