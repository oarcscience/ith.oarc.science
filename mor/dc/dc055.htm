<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_55:2">55:2</A></FONT></span> And then thou shalt be ordained by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., to be an elder unto this church, to preach repentance and remission of sins by way of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_55:3">55:3</A></FONT></span> And on whomsoever you shall lay your hands, if they are contrite before me, you shall have power to give the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_55:5">55:5</A></FONT></span> And again, verily I say unto you, for this cause you shall take your journey with my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, that you may be planted in the land of your inheritance to do this work.</p>
