### 45. Revelation through Joseph Smith to the Church, Kirtland, Ohio, March 7, 1831. * History of the Church* 1:158-63.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:1">45:1</span></span> Hearken, O
ye people of my church, to whom the kingdom has been given; hearken ye
and give ear to him who laid the foundation of the earth, who made the
heavens and all the hosts thereof, and by whom all things were made
which live, and move, and have a being.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:2">45:2</span></span> And again I
say, hearken unto my voice, lest death shall overtake you; in an hour
when ye think not the summer shall be past, and the harvest ended, and
your souls not saved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:3">45:3</span></span> Listen to
him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause
before him—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:4">45:4</span></span> Saying:
Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom
thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the
blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:5">45:5</span></span> Wherefore,
Father, spare these my brethren that believe on my name, that they may
come unto me and have everlasting life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:6">45:6</span></span> Hearken, O
ye people of my church, and ye elders listen together, and hear my voice
while it is called today, and harden not your hearts;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:7">45:7</span></span> For verily
I say unto you that I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the
light and the life of the world—a light that shineth in darkness and the
darkness comprehendeth it not.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:8">45:8</span></span> I came unto
mine own, and mine own received me not; but unto as many as received me
gave I power to do many miracles, and to become the sons of God; and
even unto them that believed on my name gave I power to obtain eternal
life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:9">45:9</span></span> And even so
I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world, to be a light to
the world, and to be a standard for my people, and for the Gentiles to
seek to it, and to be a messenger before my face to prepare the way
before me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:10">45:10</span></span>
Wherefore, come ye unto it, and with him that cometh I will reason as
with men in days of old, and I will show unto you my strong reasoning.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:11">45:11</span></span>
Wherefore, hearken ye together and let me show unto you even my
wisdom—the wisdom of him whom ye say is the God of Enoch, and his
brethren,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:12">45:12</span></span> Who were
separated from the earth, and were received unto myself—a city reserved
until a day of righteousness shall come—a day which was sought for by
all holy men, and they found it not because of wickedness and
abominations;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:13">45:13</span></span> And
confessed they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:14">45:14</span></span> But
obtained a promise that they should find it and see it in their flesh.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:15">45:15</span></span>
Wherefore, hearken and I will reason with you, and I will speak unto you
and prophesy, as unto men in days of old.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:16">45:16</span></span> And I
will show it plainly as I showed it unto my disciples as I stood before
them in the flesh, and spake unto them, saying: As ye have asked of me
concerning the signs of my coming, in the day when I shall come in my
glory in the clouds of heaven, to fulfil the promises that I have made
unto your fathers,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:17">45:17</span></span> For as ye
have looked upon the long absence of your spirits from your bodies to be
a bondage, I will show unto you how the day of redemption shall come,
and also the restoration of the scattered Israel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:18">45:18</span></span> And now
ye behold this temple which is in Jerusalem, which ye call the house of
God, and your enemies say that this house shall never fall.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:19">45:19</span></span> But,
verily I say unto you, that desolation shall come upon this generation
as a thief in the night, and this people shall be destroyed and
scattered among all nations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:20">45:20</span></span> And this
temple which ye now see shall be thrown down that there shall not be
left one stone upon another.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:21">45:21</span></span> And it
shall come to pass, that this generation of Jews shall not pass away
until every desolation which I have told you concerning them shall come
to pass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:22">45:22</span></span> Ye say
that ye know that the end of the world cometh; ye say also that ye know
that the heavens and the earth shall pass away;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:23">45:23</span></span> And in
this ye say truly, for so it is; but these things which I have told you
shall not pass away until all shall be fulfilled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:24">45:24</span></span> And this
I have told you concerning Jerusalem; and when that day shall come,
shall a remnant be scattered among all nations;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:25">45:25</span></span> But they
shall be gathered again; but they shall remain until the times of the
Gentiles be fulfilled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:26">45:26</span></span> And in
that day shall be heard of wars and rumors of wars, and the whole earth
shall be in commotion, and men's hearts shall fail them, and they shall
say that Christ delayeth his coming until the end of the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:27">45:27</span></span> And the
love of men shall wax cold, and iniquity shall abound.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:28">45:28</span></span> And when
the times of the Gentiles is come in, a light shall break forth among
them that sit in darkness, and it shall be the fulness of my gospel;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:29">45:29</span></span> But they
receive it not; for they perceive not the light, and they turn their
hearts from me because of the precepts of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:30">45:30</span></span> And in
that generation shall the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:31">45:31</span></span> And there
shall be men standing in that generation, that shall not pass until they
shall see an overflowing scourge; for a desolating sickness shall cover
the land.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:32">45:32</span></span> But my
disciples shall stand in holy places, and shall not be moved; but among
the wicked, men shall lift up their voices and curse God and die.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:33">45:33</span></span> And there
shall be earthquakes also in divers places, and many desolations; yet
men will harden their hearts against me, and they will take up the
sword, one against another, and they will kill one another.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:34">45:34</span></span> And now,
when I the Lord had spoken these words unto my disciples, they were
troubled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:35">45:35</span></span> And I
said unto them: Be not troubled, for, when all these things shall come
to pass, ye may know that the promises which have been made unto you
shall be fulfilled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:36">45:36</span></span> And when
the light shall begin to break forth, it shall be with them like unto a
parable which I will show you—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:37">45:37</span></span> Ye look
and behold the fig-trees, and ye see them with your eyes, and ye say
when they begin to shoot forth, and their leaves are yet tender, that
summer is now nigh at hand;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:38">45:38</span></span> Even so
it shall be in that day when they shall see all these things, then shall
they know that the hour is nigh.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:39">45:39</span></span> And it
shall come to pass that he that feareth me shall be looking forth for
the great day of the Lord to come, even for the signs of the coming of
the Son of Man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:40">45:40</span></span> And they
shall see signs and wonders, for they shall be shown forth in the
heavens above, and in the earth beneath.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:41">45:41</span></span> And they
shall behold blood, and fire, and vapors of smoke.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:42">45:42</span></span> And
before the day of the Lord shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and
the moon be turned into blood, and the stars fall from heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:43">45:43</span></span> And the
remnant shall be gathered unto this place;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:44">45:44</span></span> And then
they shall look for me, and, behold, I will come; and they shall see me
in the clouds of heaven, clothed with power and great glory; with all
the holy angels; and he that watches not for me shall be cut off.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:45">45:45</span></span> But
before the arm of the Lord shall fall, an angel shall sound his trump,
and the saints that have slept shall come forth to meet me in the cloud.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:46">45:46</span></span>
Wherefore, if ye have slept in peace blessed are you; for as you now
behold me and know that I am, even so shall ye come unto me and your
souls shall live, and your redemption shall be perfected; and the saints
shall come forth from the four quarters of the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:47">45:47</span></span> Then
shall the arm of the Lord fall upon the nations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:48">45:48</span></span> And then
shall the Lord set his foot upon this mount, and it shall cleave in
twain, and the earth shall tremble, and reel to and fro, and the heavens
also shall shake.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:49">45:49</span></span> And the
Lord shall utter his voice, and all the ends of the earth shall hear it;
and the nations of the earth shall mourn, and they that have laughed
shall see their folly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:50">45:50</span></span> And
calamity shall cover the mocker, and the scorner shall be consumed; and
they that have watched for iniquity shall be hewn down and cast into the
fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:51">45:51</span></span> And then
shall the Jews look upon me and say: What are these wounds in thine
hands and in thy feet?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:52">45:52</span></span> Then
shall they know that I am the Lord; for I will say unto them: These
wounds are the wounds with which I was wounded in the house of my
friends. I am he who was lifted up. I am Jesus that was crucified. I am
the Son of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:53">45:53</span></span> And then
shall they weep because of their iniquities; then shall they lament
because they persecuted their king.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:54">45:54</span></span> And then
shall the heathen nations be redeemed, and they that knew no law shall
have part in the first resurrection; and it shall be tolerable for them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:55">45:55</span></span> And Satan
shall be bound, that he shall have no place in the hearts of the
children of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:56">45:56</span></span> And at
that day, when I shall come in my glory, shall the parable be fulfilled
which I spake concerning the ten virgins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:57">45:57</span></span> For they
that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy
Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived—verily I say unto
you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide
the day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:58">45:58</span></span> And the
earth shall be given unto them for an inheritance; and they shall
multiply and wax strong, and their children shall grow up without sin
unto salvation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:59">45:59</span></span> For the
Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he
will be their king and their lawgiver.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:60">45:60</span></span> And now,
behold, I say unto you, it shall not be given unto you to know any
further concerning this chapter, until the New Testament be translated,
and in it all these things shall be made known;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:61">45:61</span></span> Wherefore
I give unto you that ye may now translate it, that ye may be prepared
for the things to come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:62">45:62</span></span> For
verily I say unto you, that great things await you;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:63">45:63</span></span> Ye hear
of wars in foreign lands; but, behold, I say unto you, they are nigh,
even at your doors, and not many years hence ye shall hear of wars in
your own lands.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:64">45:64</span></span> Wherefore
I, the Lord, have said, gather ye out from the eastern lands, assemble
ye yourselves together ye elders of my church; go ye forth into the
western countries, call upon the inhabitants to repent, and inasmuch as
they do repent, build up churches unto me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:65">45:65</span></span> And with
one heart and with one mind, gather up your riches that ye may purchase
an inheritance which shall hereafter be appointed unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:66">45:66</span></span> And it
shall be called the New Jerusalem, a land of peace, a city of refuge, a
place of safety for the saints of the Most High God;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:67">45:67</span></span> And the
glory of the Lord shall be there, and the terror of the Lord also shall
be there, insomuch that the wicked will not come unto it, and it shall
be called Zion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:68">45:68</span></span> And it
shall come to pass among the wicked, that every man that will not take
his sword against his neighbor must needs flee unto Zion for safety.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:69">45:69</span></span> And there
shall be gathered unto it out of every nation under heaven; and it shall
be the only people that shall not be at war one with another.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:70">45:70</span></span> And it
shall be said among the wicked: Let us not go up to battle against Zion,
for the inhabitants of Zion are terrible; wherefore we cannot stand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:71">45:71</span></span> And it
shall come to pass that the righteous shall be gathered out from among
all nations, and shall come to Zion, singing with songs of everlasting
joy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:72">45:72</span></span> And now I
say unto you, keep these things from going abroad unto the world until
it is expedient in me, that ye may accomplish this work in the eyes of
the people, and in the eyes of your enemies, that they may not know your
works until ye have accomplished the thing which I have commanded you;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:73">45:73</span></span> That when
they shall know it, that they may consider these things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:74">45:74</span></span> For when
the Lord shall appear he shall be terrible unto them, that fear may
seize upon them, and they shall stand afar off and tremble.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45:75">45:75</span></span> And all
nations shall be afraid because of the terror of the Lord, and the power
of his might. Even so. Amen.
