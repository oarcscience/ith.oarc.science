### 111. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Salem, Massachusetts, August 6, 1836. * History of the Church* 2:465-66.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_111:1">111:1</span></span> I, the
Lord your God, am not displeased with your coming this journey,
notwithstanding your follies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_111:2">111:2</span></span> I have
much treasure in this city for you, for the benefit of Zion, and many
people in this city, whom I will gather out in due time for the benefit
of Zion, through your instrumentality.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_111:3">111:3</span></span>
Therefore, it is expedient that you should form acquaintance with men in
this city, as you shall be led, and as it shall be given you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_111:4">111:4</span></span> And it
shall come to pass in due time that I will give this city into your
hands, that you shall have power over it, insomuch that they shall not
discover your secret parts; and its wealth pertaining to gold and silver
shall be yours.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_111:5">111:5</span></span> Concern
not yourselves about your debts, for I will give you power to pay them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_111:6">111:6</span></span> Concern
not yourselves about Zion, for I will deal mercifully with her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_111:7">111:7</span></span> Tarry in
this place, and in the regions round about;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_111:8">111:8</span></span> And the
place where it is my will that you should tarry, for the main, shall be
signalized unto you by the peace and power of my Spirit, that shall flow
unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_111:9">111:9</span></span> This
place you may obtain by hire. And inquire diligently concerning the more
ancient inhabitants and founders of this city;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_111:10">111:10</span></span> For
there are more treasures than one for you in this city.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_111:11">111:11</span></span>
Therefore, be ye as wise as serpents and yet without sin; and I will
order all things for your good, as fast as ye are able to receive them.
Amen.
