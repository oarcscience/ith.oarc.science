### 118. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Far West, Missouri, July 8, 1838. * History of the Church* 3:46-47.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_118:1">118:1</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord: Let a conference be held immediately; let the
Twelve be organized; and let men be appointed to supply the place of
those who are fallen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_118:2">118:2</span></span> Let my
servant Thomas remain for a season in the land of Zion, to publish my
word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_118:3">118:3</span></span> Let the
residue continue to preach from that hour, and if they will do this in
all lowliness of heart, in meekness and humility, and long-suffering, I,
the Lord, give unto them a promise that I will provide for their
families; and an effectual door shall be opened for them, from
henceforth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_118:4">118:4</span></span> And next
spring let them depart to go over the great waters, and there promulgate
my gospel, the fulness thereof, and bear record of my name.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_118:5">118:5</span></span> Let them
take leave of my saints in the city of Far West, on the twenty-sixth day
of April next, on the building-spot of my house, saith the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_118:6">118:6</span></span> Let my
servant John Taylor, and also my servant John E. Page, and also my
servant Wilford Woodruff, and also my servant Willard Richards, be
appointed to fill the places of those who have fallen, and be officially
notified of their appointment.
