### 114. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Far West, Missouri, April 17, 1838. * History of the Church* 3:23.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_114:1">114:1</span></span> Verily
thus saith the Lord: It is wisdom in my servant David W. Patten, that he
settle up all his business as soon as he possibly can, and make a
disposition of his merchandise, that he may perform a mission unto me
next spring, in company with others, even twelve including himself, to
testify of my name and bear glad tidings unto all the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_114:2">114:2</span></span> For
verily thus saith the Lord, that inasmuch as there are those among you
who deny my name, others shall be planted in their stead and receive
their bishopric. Amen.
