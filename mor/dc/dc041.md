### 41. Revelation through Joseph Smith to the Church, Kirtland, Ohio, February 4, 1831. * History of the Church* 1:146-47.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41:1">41:1</span></span> Hearken and
hear, O ye my people, saith the Lord and your God, ye whom I delight to
bless with the greatest of all blessings, ye that hear me; and ye that
hear me not will I curse, that have professed my name, with the heaviest
of all cursings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41:2">41:2</span></span> Hearken, O
ye elders of my church whom I have called, behold I give unto you a
commandment, that ye shall assemble yourselves together to agree upon my
word;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41:3">41:3</span></span> And by the
prayer of your faith ye shall receive my law, that ye may know how to
govern my church and have all things right before me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41:4">41:4</span></span> And I will
be your ruler when I come; and behold, I come quickly, and ye shall see
that my law is kept.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41:5">41:5</span></span> He that
receiveth my law and doeth it, the same is my disciple; and he that
saith he receiveth it and doeth it not, the same is not my disciple, and
shall be cast out from among you;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41:6">41:6</span></span> For it is
not meet that the things which belong to the children of the kingdom
should be given to them that are not worthy, or to dogs, or the pearls
to be cast before swine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41:7">41:7</span></span> And again,
it is meet that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., should have a house
built, in which to live and translate.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41:8">41:8</span></span> And again,
it is meet that my servant Sidney Rigdon should live as seemeth him
good, inasmuch as he keepeth my commandments.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41:9">41:9</span></span> And again,
I have called my servant Edward Partridge; and I give a commandment,
that he should be appointed by the voice of the church, and ordained a
bishop unto the church, to leave his merchandise and to spend all his
time in the labors of the church;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41:10">41:10</span></span> To see to
all things as it shall be appointed unto him in my laws in the day that
I shall give them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41:11">41:11</span></span> And this
because his heart is pure before me, for he is like unto Nathanael of
old, in whom there is no guile.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41:12">41:12</span></span> These
words are given unto you, and they are pure before me; wherefore, beware
how you hold them, for they are to be answered upon your souls in the
day of judgment. Even so. Amen.
