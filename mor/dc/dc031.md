### 31. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Thomas B. Marsh, September 1830. * History of the Church* 1:115-17.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31:1">31:1</span></span> Thomas, my
son, blessed are you because of your faith in my work.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31:2">31:2</span></span> Behold, you
have had many afflictions because of your family; nevertheless, I will
bless you and your family, yea, your little ones; and the day cometh
that they will believe and know the truth and be one with you in my
church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31:3">31:3</span></span> Lift up
your heart and rejoice, for the hour of your mission is come; and your
tongue shall be loosed, and you shall declare glad tidings of great joy
unto this generation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31:4">31:4</span></span> You shall
declare the things which have been revealed to my servant, Joseph Smith,
Jun. You shall begin to preach from this time forth, yea, to reap in the
field which is white already to be burned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31:5">31:5</span></span> Therefore,
thrust in your sickle with all your soul, and your sins are forgiven
you, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your back, for the laborer
is worthy of his hire. Wherefore, your family shall live.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31:6">31:6</span></span> Behold,
verily I say unto you, go from them only for a little time, and declare
my word, and I will prepare a place for them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31:7">31:7</span></span> Yea, I will
open the hearts of the people, and they will receive you. And I will
establish a church by your hand;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31:8">31:8</span></span> And you
shall strengthen them and prepare them against the time when they shall
be gathered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31:9">31:9</span></span> Be patient
in afflictions, revile not against those that revile. Govern your house
in meekness, and be steadfast.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31:10">31:10</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you that you shall be a physician unto the church, but not unto
the world, for they will not receive you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31:11">31:11</span></span> Go your
way whithersoever I will, and it shall be given you by the Comforter
what you shall do and whither you shall go.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31:12">31:12</span></span> Pray
always, lest you enter into temptation and lose your reward.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31:13">31:13</span></span> Be
faithful unto the end, and lo, I am with you. These words are not of man
nor of men, but of me, even Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, by the will of
the Father. Amen.
