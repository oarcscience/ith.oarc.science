### 130. Instructions given by Joseph Smith, Ramus, Illinois, April 2, 1843. * History of the Church* 5:323-25.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:1">130:1</span></span> When the
Savior shall appear we shall see him as he is. We shall see that he is a
man like ourselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:2">130:2</span></span> And that
same sociality which exists among us here will exist among us there,
only it will be coupled with eternal glory, which glory we do not now
enjoy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:3">130:3</span></span> John
14:23—The appearing of the Father and the Son, in that verse, is a
personal appearance; and the idea that the Father and the Son dwell in a
man's heart is an old sectarian notion, and is false.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:4">130:4</span></span> In answer
to the question—Is not the reckoning of God's time, angel's time,
prophet's time, and man's time, according to the planet on which they
reside?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:5">130:5</span></span> I answer,
Yes. But there are no angels who minister to this earth but those who do
belong or have belonged to it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:6">130:6</span></span> The
angels do not reside on a planet like this earth;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:7">130:7</span></span> But they
reside in the presence of God, on a globe like a sea of glass and fire,
where all things for their glory are manifest, past, present, and
future, and are continually before the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:8">130:8</span></span> The place
where God resides is a great Urim and Thummim.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:9">130:9</span></span> This
earth, in its sanctified and immortal state, will be made like unto
crystal and will be a Urim and Thummim to the inhabitants who dwell
thereon, whereby all things pertaining to an inferior kingdom, or all
kingdoms of a lower order, will be manifest to those who dwell on it;
and this earth will be Christ's.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:10">130:10</span></span> Then
the white stone mentioned in Revelation 2:17, will become a Urim and
Thummim to each individual who receives one, whereby things pertaining
to a higher order of kingdoms will be made known;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:11">130:11</span></span> And a
white stone is given to each of those who come into the celestial
kingdom, whereon is a new name written, which no man knoweth save he
that receiveth it. The new name is the key word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:12">130:12</span></span> I
prophesy, in the name of the Lord God, that the commencement of the
difficulties which will cause much bloodshed previous to the coming of
the Son of Man will be in South Carolina.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:13">130:13</span></span> It may
probably arise through the slave question. This a voice declared to me,
while I was praying earnestly on the subject, December 25th, 1832.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:14">130:14</span></span> I was
once praying very earnestly to know the time of the coming of the Son of
Man, when I heard a voice repeat the following:

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:15">130:15</span></span> Joseph,
my son, if thou livest until thou art eighty-five years old, thou shalt
see the face of the Son of Man; therefore let this suffice, and trouble
me no more on this matter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:16">130:16</span></span> I was
left thus, without being able to decide whether this coming referred to
the beginning of the millennium or to some previous appearing, or
whether I should die and thus see his face.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:17">130:17</span></span> I
believe the coming of the Son of Man will not be any sooner than that
time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:18">130:18</span></span>
Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will
rise with us in the resurrection.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:19">130:19</span></span> And if
a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his
diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage
in the world to come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:20">130:20</span></span> There
is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this
world, upon which all blessings are predicated—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:21">130:21</span></span> And
when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law
upon which it is predicated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:22">130:22</span></span> The
Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also;
but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage
of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130:23">130:23</span></span> A man
may receive the Holy Ghost, and it may descend upon him and not tarry
with him.
