### 79. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Hiram, Ohio, March 1832. * History of the Church* 1:257.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_79:1">79:1</span></span> Verily I
say unto you, that it is my will that my servant Jared Carter should go
again into the eastern countries, from place to place, and from city to
city, in the power of the ordination wherewith he has been ordained,
proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_79:2">79:2</span></span> And I will
send upon him the Comforter, which shall teach him the truth and the way
whither he shall go;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_79:3">79:3</span></span> And
inasmuch as he is faithful, I will crown him again with sheaves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_79:4">79:4</span></span> Wherefore,
let your heart be glad, my servant Jared Carter, and fear not, saith
your Lord, even Jesus Christ. Amen.
