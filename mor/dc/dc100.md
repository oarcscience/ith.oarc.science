### 100. Revelation to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, Perrysburg, New York, October 12, 1833. * History of the Church* 1:416, 419-21.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:1">100:1</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord unto you, my friends Sidney and Joseph, your
families are well; they are in mine hands, and I will do with them as
seemeth me good; for in me there is all power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:2">100:2</span></span>
Therefore, follow me, and listen to the counsel which I shall give unto
you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:3">100:3</span></span> Behold,
and lo, I have much people in this place, in the regions round about;
and an effectual door shall be opened in the regions round about in this
eastern land.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:4">100:4</span></span>
Therefore, I, the Lord, have suffered you to come unto this place; for
thus it was expedient in me for the salvation of souls.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:5">100:5</span></span>
Therefore, verily I say unto you, lift up your voices unto this people;
speak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts, and you shall not
be confounded before men;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:6">100:6</span></span> For it
shall be given you in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye
shall say.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:7">100:7</span></span> But a
commandment I give unto you, that ye shall declare whatsoever thing ye
declare in my name, in solemnity of heart, in the spirit of meekness, in
all things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:8">100:8</span></span> And I
give unto you this promise, that inasmuch as ye do this the Holy Ghost
shall be shed forth in bearing record unto all things whatsoever ye
shall say.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:9">100:9</span></span> And it is
expedient in me that you, my servant Sidney, should be a spokesman unto
this people; yea, verily, I will ordain you unto this calling, even to
be a spokesman unto my servant Joseph.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:10">100:10</span></span> And I
will give unto him power to be mighty in testimony.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:11">100:11</span></span> And I
will give unto thee power to be mighty in expounding all scriptures,
that thou mayest be a spokesman unto him, and he shall be a revelator
unto thee, that thou mayest know the certainty of all things pertaining
to the things of my kingdom on the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:12">100:12</span></span>
Therefore, continue your journey and let your hearts rejoice; for
behold, and lo, I am with you even unto the end.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:13">100:13</span></span> And now
I give unto you a word concerning Zion. Zion shall be redeemed, although
she is chastened for a little season.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:14">100:14</span></span> Thy
brethren, my servants Orson Hyde and John Gould, are in my hands; and
inasmuch as they keep my commandments they shall be saved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:15">100:15</span></span>
Therefore, let your hearts be comforted; for all things shall work
together for good to them that walk uprightly, and to the sanctification
of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:16">100:16</span></span> For I
will raise up unto myself a pure people, that will serve me in
righteousness;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100:17">100:17</span></span> And all
that call upon the name of the Lord, and keep his commandments, shall be
saved. Even so. Amen.
