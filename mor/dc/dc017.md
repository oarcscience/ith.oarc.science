### 17. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, Fayette, New York, June 1829. * History of the Church* 1:52-57.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_17:1">17:1</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you, that you must rely upon my word, which if you do with full
purpose of heart, you shall have a view of the plates, and also of the
breastplate, the sword of Laban, the Urim and Thummim, which were given
to the brother of Jared upon the mount, when he talked with the Lord
face to face, and the miraculous directors which were given to Lehi
while in the wilderness, on the borders of the Red Sea.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_17:2">17:2</span></span> And it is
by your faith that you shall obtain a view of them, even by that faith
which was had by the prophets of old.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_17:3">17:3</span></span> And after
that you have obtained faith, and have seen them with your eyes, you
shall testify of them, by the power of God;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_17:4">17:4</span></span> And this
you shall do that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., may not be destroyed,
that I may bring about my righteous purposes unto the children of men in
this work.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_17:5">17:5</span></span> And ye
shall testify that you have seen them, even as my servant Joseph Smith,
Jun., has seen them; for it is by my power that he has seen them, and it
is because he had faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_17:6">17:6</span></span> And he has
translated the book, even that part which I have commanded him, and as
your Lord and your God liveth it is true.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_17:7">17:7</span></span> Wherefore,
you have received the same power, and the same faith, and the same gift
like unto him;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_17:8">17:8</span></span> And if you
do these last commandments of mine, which I have given you, the gates of
hell shall not prevail against you; for my grace is sufficient for you,
and you shall be lifted up at the last day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_17:9">17:9</span></span> And I,
Jesus Christ, your Lord and your God, have spoken it unto you, that I
might bring about my righteous purposes unto the children of men. Amen.
