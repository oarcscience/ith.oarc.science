### 37. Revelation to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, near Fayette, New York, December 1830. * History of the Church* 1:139.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_37:1">37:1</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you that it is not expedient in me that ye should translate any
more until ye shall go to the Ohio, and this because of the enemy and
for your sakes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_37:2">37:2</span></span> And again,
I say unto you that ye shall not go until ye have preached my gospel in
those parts, and have strengthened up the church whithersoever it is
found, and more especially in Colesville; for, behold, they pray unto me
in much faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_37:3">37:3</span></span> And again,
a commandment I give unto the church, that it is expedient in me that
they should assemble together at the Ohio, against the time that my
servant Oliver Cowdery shall return unto them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_37:4">37:4</span></span> Behold,
here is wisdom, and let every man choose for himself until I come. Even
so. Amen.
