### 74. Revelation to Joseph Smith, Hiram, Ohio, January 1832. * History of the Church* 1:242.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_74:1">74:1</span></span> For the
unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife
is sanctified by the husband; else were your children unclean, but now
are they holy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_74:2">74:2</span></span> Now, in the
days of the apostles the law of circumcision was had among all the Jews
who believed not the gospel of Jesus Christ.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_74:3">74:3</span></span> And it came
to pass that there arose a great contention among the people concerning
the law of circumcision, for the unbelieving husband was desirous that
his children should be circumcised and become subject to the law of
Moses, which law was fulfilled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_74:4">74:4</span></span> And it came
to pass that the children, being brought up in subjection to the law of
Moses, gave heed to the traditions of their fathers and believed not the
gospel of Christ, wherein they became unholy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_74:5">74:5</span></span> Wherefore,
for this cause the apostle wrote unto the church, giving unto them a
commandment, not of the Lord, but of himself, that a believer should not
be united to an unbeliever; except the law of Moses should be done away
among them,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_74:6">74:6</span></span> That their
children might remain without circumcision; and that the tradition might
be done away, which saith that little children are unholy; for it was
had among the Jews;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_74:7">74:7</span></span> But little
children are holy, being sanctified through the atonement of Jesus
Christ; and this is what the scriptures mean.
