### 16. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Peter Whitmer, Jr., Fayette, New York, June 1829. * History of the Church* 1:51.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_16:1">16:1</span></span> Hearken, my
servant Peter, and listen to the words of Jesus Christ, your Lord and
your Redeemer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_16:2">16:2</span></span> For behold,
I speak unto you with sharpness and with power, for mine arm is over all
the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_16:3">16:3</span></span> And I will
tell you that which no man knoweth save me and thee alone—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_16:4">16:4</span></span> For many
times you have desired of me to know that which would be of the most
worth unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_16:5">16:5</span></span> Behold,
blessed are you for this thing, and for speaking my words which I have
given unto you according to my commandments.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_16:6">16:6</span></span> And now,
behold, I say unto you, that the thing which will be of the most worth
unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people, that you may
bring souls unto me, that you may rest with them in the kingdom of my
Father. Amen.
