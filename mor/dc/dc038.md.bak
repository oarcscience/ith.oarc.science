### 38. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Fayette, New York, January 2, 1831. * History of the Church* 1:140-43.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:1">38:1</span></span> Thus saith
the Lord your God, even Jesus Christ, the Great I AM, Alpha and Omega,
the beginning and the end, the same which looked upon the wide expanse
of eternity, and all the seraphic hosts of heaven, before the world was
made;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:2">38:2</span></span> The same
which knoweth all things, for all things are present before mine eyes;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:3">38:3</span></span> I am the
same which spake, and the world was made, and all things came by me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:4">38:4</span></span> I am the
same which have taken the Zion of Enoch into mine own bosom; and verily,
I say, even as many as have believed in my name, for I am Christ, and in
mine own name, by the virtue of the blood which I have spilt, have I
pleaded before the Father for them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:5">38:5</span></span> But behold,
the residue of the wicked have I kept in chains of darkness until the
judgment of the great day, which shall come at the end of the earth;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:6">38:6</span></span> And even so
will I cause the wicked to be kept, that will not hear my voice but
harden their hearts, and wo, wo, wo, is their doom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:7">38:7</span></span> But behold,
verily, verily, I say unto you that mine eyes are upon you. I am in your
midst and ye cannot see me;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:8">38:8</span></span> But the day
soon cometh that ye shall see me, and know that I am; for the veil of
darkness shall soon be rent, and he that is not purified shall not abide
the day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:9">38:9</span></span> Wherefore,
gird up your loins and be prepared. Behold, the kingdom is yours, and
the enemy shall not overcome.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:10">38:10</span></span> Verily I
say unto you, ye are clean, but not all; and there is none else with
whom I am well pleased;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:11">38:11</span></span> For all
flesh is corrupted before me; and the powers of darkness prevail upon
the earth, among the children of men, in the presence of all the hosts
of heaven—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:12">38:12</span></span> Which
causeth silence to reign, and all eternity is pained, and the angels are
waiting the great command to reap down the earth, to gather the tares
that they may be burned; and, behold, the enemy is combined.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:13">38:13</span></span> And now I
show unto you a mystery, a thing which is had in secret chambers, to
bring to pass even your destruction in process of time, and ye knew it
not;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:14">38:14</span></span> But now I
tell it unto you, and ye are blessed, not because of your iniquity,
neither your hearts of unbelief; for verily some of you are guilty
before me, but I will be merciful unto your weakness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:15">38:15</span></span>
Therefore, be ye strong from henceforth; fear not, for the kingdom is
yours.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:16">38:16</span></span> And for
your salvation I give unto you a commandment, for I have heard your
prayers, and the poor have complained before me, and the rich have I
made, and all flesh is mine, and I am no respecter of persons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:17">38:17</span></span> And I
have made the earth rich, and behold it is my footstool, wherefore,
again I will stand upon it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:18">38:18</span></span> And I
hold forth and deign to give unto you greater riches, even a land of
promise, a land flowing with milk and honey, upon which there shall be
no curse when the Lord cometh;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:19">38:19</span></span> And I
will give it unto you for the land of your inheritance, if you seek it
with all your hearts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:20">38:20</span></span> And this
shall be my covenant with you, ye shall have it for the land of your
inheritance, and for the inheritance of your children forever, while the
earth shall stand, and ye shall possess it again in eternity, no more to
pass away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:21">38:21</span></span> But,
verily I say unto you that in time ye shall have no king nor ruler, for
I will be your king and watch over you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:22">38:22</span></span>
Wherefore, hear my voice and follow me, and you shall be a free people,
and ye shall have no laws but my laws when I come, for I am your
lawgiver, and what can stay my hand?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:23">38:23</span></span> But,
verily I say unto you, teach one another according to the office
wherewith I have appointed you;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:24">38:24</span></span> And let
every man esteem his brother as himself, and practise virtue and
holiness before me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:25">38:25</span></span> And again
I say unto you, let every man esteem his brother as himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:26">38:26</span></span> For what
man among you having twelve sons, and is no respecter of them, and they
serve him obediently, and he saith unto the one: Be thou clothed in
robes and sit thou here; and to the other: Be thou clothed in rags and
sit thou there—and looketh upon his sons and saith I am just?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:27">38:27</span></span> Behold,
this I have given unto you as a parable, and it is even as I am. I say
unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:28">38:28</span></span> And
again, I say unto you that the enemy in the secret chambers seeketh your
lives.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:29">38:29</span></span> Ye hear
of wars in far countries, and you say that there will soon be great wars
in far countries, but ye know not the hearts of men in your own land.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:30">38:30</span></span> I tell
you these things because of your prayers; wherefore, treasure up wisdom
in your bosoms, lest the wickedness of men reveal these things unto you
by their wickedness, in a manner which shall speak in your ears with a
voice louder than that which shall shake the earth; but if ye are
prepared ye shall not fear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:31">38:31</span></span> And that
ye might escape the power of the enemy, and be gathered unto me a
righteous people, without spot and blameless—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:32">38:32</span></span>
Wherefore, for this cause I gave unto you the commandment that ye should
go to the Ohio; and there I will give unto you my law; and there you
shall be endowed with power from on high;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:33">38:33</span></span> And from
thence, whosoever I will shall go forth among all nations, and it shall
be told them what they shall do; for I have a great work laid up in
store, for Israel shall be saved, and I will lead them whithersoever I
will, and no power shall stay my hand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:34">38:34</span></span> And now,
I give unto the church in these parts a commandment, that certain men
among them shall be appointed, and they shall be appointed by the voice
of the church;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:35">38:35</span></span> And they
shall look to the poor and the needy, and administer to their relief
that they shall not suffer; and send them forth to the place which I
have commanded them;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:36">38:36</span></span> And this
shall be their work, to govern the affairs of the property of this
church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:37">38:37</span></span> And they
that have farms that cannot be sold, let them be left or rented as
seemeth them good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:38">38:38</span></span> See that
all things are preserved; and when men are endowed with power from on
high and sent forth, all these things shall be gathered unto the bosom
of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:39">38:39</span></span> And if ye
seek the riches which it is the will of the Father to give unto you, ye
shall be the richest of all people, for ye shall have the riches of
eternity; and it must needs be that the riches of the earth are mine to
give; but beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:40">38:40</span></span> And
again, I say unto you, I give unto you a commandment, that every man,
both elder, priest, teacher, and also member, go to with his might, with
the labor of his hands, to prepare and accomplish the things which I
have commanded.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:41">38:41</span></span> And let
your preaching be the warning voice, every man to his neighbor, in
mildness and in meekness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38:42">38:42</span></span> And go ye
out from among the wicked. Save yourselves. Be ye clean that bear the
vessels of the Lord. Even so. Amen.
