### 11. Revelation through Joseph Smith to his brother Hyrum Smith, Harmony, Pennsylvania, May 1829. * History of the Church* 1:39-46.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:1">11:1</span></span> A great and
marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:2">11:2</span></span> Behold, I
am God; give heed to my word, which is quick and powerful, sharper than
a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and marrow;
therefore give heed unto my word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:3">11:3</span></span> Behold, the
field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap let
him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts,
that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the
kingdom of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:4">11:4</span></span> Yea,
whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:5">11:5</span></span> Therefore,
if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will knock it shall be
opened unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:6">11:6</span></span> Now, as you
have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my commandments, and seek to
bring forth and establish the cause of Zion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:7">11:7</span></span> Seek not
for riches but for wisdom; and, behold, the mysteries of God shall be
unfolded unto you, and then shall you be made rich. Behold, he that hath
eternal life is rich.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:8">11:8</span></span> Verily,
verily, I say unto you, even as you desire of me so it shall be done
unto you; and, if you desire, you shall be the means of doing much good
in this generation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:9">11:9</span></span> Say nothing
but repentance unto this generation. Keep my commandments, and assist to
bring forth my work, according to my commandments, and you shall be
blessed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:10">11:10</span></span> Behold,
thou hast a gift, or thou shalt have a gift if thou wilt desire of me in
faith, with an honest heart, believing in the power of Jesus Christ, or
in my power which speaketh unto thee;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:11">11:11</span></span> For,
behold, it is I that speak; behold, I am the light which shineth in
darkness, and by my power I give these words unto thee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:12">11:12</span></span> And now,
verily, verily, I say unto thee, put your trust in that Spirit which
leadeth to do good—yea, to do justly, to walk humbly, to judge
righteously; and this is my Spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:13">11:13</span></span> Verily,
verily, I say unto you, I will impart unto you of my Spirit, which shall
enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:14">11:14</span></span> And then
shall ye know, or by this shall you know, all things whatsoever you
desire of me, which are pertaining unto things of righteousness, in
faith believing in me that you shall receive.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:15">11:15</span></span> Behold, I
command you that you need not suppose that you are called to preach
until you are called.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:16">11:16</span></span> Wait a
little longer, until you shall have my word, my rock, my church, and my
gospel, that you may know of a surety my doctrine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:17">11:17</span></span> And then,
behold, according to your desires, yea, even according to your faith
shall it be done unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:18">11:18</span></span> Keep my
commandments; hold your peace; appeal unto my Spirit;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:19">11:19</span></span> Yea,
cleave unto me with all your heart, that you may assist in bringing to
light those things of which has been spoken—yea, the translation of my
work; be patient until you shall accomplish it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:20">11:20</span></span> Behold,
this is your work, to keep my commandments, yea, with all your might,
mind and strength.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:21">11:21</span></span> Seek not
to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall
your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and
my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:22">11:22</span></span> But now
hold your peace; study my word which hath gone forth among the children
of men, and also study my word which shall come forth among the children
of men, or that which is now translating, yea, until you have obtained
all which I shall grant unto the children of men in this generation, and
then shall all things be added thereto.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:23">11:23</span></span> Behold
thou art Hyrum, my son; seek the kingdom of God, and all things shall be
added according to that which is just.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:24">11:24</span></span> Build
upon my rock, which is my gospel;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:25">11:25</span></span> Deny not
the spirit of revelation, nor the spirit of prophecy, for wo unto him
that denieth these things;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:26">11:26</span></span>
Therefore, treasure up in your heart until the time which is in my
wisdom that you shall go forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:27">11:27</span></span> Behold, I
speak unto all who have good desires, and have thrust in their sickle to
reap.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:28">11:28</span></span> Behold, I
am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I am the life and the light of the
world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:29">11:29</span></span> I am the
same who came unto mine own and mine own received me not;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_11:30">11:30</span></span> But
verily, verily, I say unto you, that as many as receive me, to them will
I give power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on my
name. Amen.
