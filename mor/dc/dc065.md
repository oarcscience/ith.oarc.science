### 65. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Hiram, Ohio, October 1831. * History of the Church* 1:218.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_65:1">65:1</span></span> Hearken,
and lo, a voice as of one sent down from on high, who is mighty and
powerful, whose going forth is unto the ends of the earth, yea, whose
voice is unto men—Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths
straight.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_65:2">65:2</span></span> The keys of
the kingdom of God are committed unto man on the earth, and from thence
shall the gospel roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone
which is cut out of the mountain without hands shall roll forth, until
it has filled the whole earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_65:3">65:3</span></span> Yea, a
voice crying—Prepare ye the way of the Lord, prepare ye the supper of
the Lamb, make ready for the Bridegroom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_65:4">65:4</span></span> Pray unto
the Lord, call upon his holy name, make known his wonderful works among
the people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_65:5">65:5</span></span> Call upon
the Lord, that his kingdom may go forth upon the earth, that the
inhabitants thereof may receive it, and be prepared for the days to
come, in the which the Son of Man shall come down in heaven, clothed in
the brightness of his glory, to meet the kingdom of God which is set up
on the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_65:6">65:6</span></span> Wherefore,
may the kingdom of God go forth, that the kingdom of heaven may come,
that thou, O God, mayest be glorified in heaven so on earth, that thine
enemies may be subdued; for thine is the honor, power and glory, forever
and ever. Amen.
