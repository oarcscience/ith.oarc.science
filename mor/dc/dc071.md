### 71. Revelation to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, Hiram, Ohio, December 1, 1831. * History of the Church* 1:238-39.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_71:1">71:1</span></span> Behold,
thus saith the Lord unto you my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney
Rigdon, that the time has verily come that it is necessary and expedient
in me that you should open your mouths in proclaiming my gospel, the
things of the kingdom, expounding the mysteries thereof out of the
scriptures, according to that portion of Spirit and power which shall be
given unto you, even as I will.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_71:2">71:2</span></span> Verily I
say unto you, proclaim unto the world in the regions round about, and in
the church also, for the space of a season, even until it shall be made
known unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_71:3">71:3</span></span> Verily this
is a mission for a season, which I give unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_71:4">71:4</span></span> Wherefore,
labor ye in my vineyard. Call upon the inhabitants of the earth, and
bear record, and prepare the way for the commandments and revelations
which are to come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_71:5">71:5</span></span> Now, behold
this is wisdom; whoso readeth, let him understand and receive also;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_71:6">71:6</span></span> For unto
him that receiveth it shall be given more abundantly, even power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_71:7">71:7</span></span> Wherefore,
confound your enemies; call upon them to meet you both in public and in
private; and inasmuch as ye are faithful their shame shall be made
manifest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_71:8">71:8</span></span> Wherefore,
let them bring forth their strong reasons against the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_71:9">71:9</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord unto you—there is no weapon that is formed against
you shall prosper;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_71:10">71:10</span></span> And if
any man lift his voice against you he shall be confounded in mine own
due time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_71:11">71:11</span></span>
Wherefore, keep my commandments; they are true and faithful. Even so.
Amen.
