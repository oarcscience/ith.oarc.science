### 95. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Kirtland, Ohio, June 1, 1833. * History of the Church* 1:350-52.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:1">95:1</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord unto you whom I love, and whom I love I also chasten
that their sins may be forgiven, for with the chastisement I prepare a
way for their deliverance in all things out of temptation, and I have
loved you—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:2">95:2</span></span> Wherefore,
ye must needs be chastened and stand rebuked before my face;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:3">95:3</span></span> For ye have
sinned against me a very grievous sin, in that ye have not considered
the great commandment in all things, that I have given unto you
concerning the building of mine house;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:4">95:4</span></span> For the
preparation wherewith I design to prepare mine apostles to prune my
vineyard for the last time, that I may bring to pass my strange act,
that I may pour out my Spirit upon all flesh—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:5">95:5</span></span> But behold,
verily I say unto you, that there are many who have been ordained among
you, whom I have called but few of them are chosen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:6">95:6</span></span> They who
are not chosen have sinned a very grievous sin, in that they are walking
in darkness at noon-day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:7">95:7</span></span> And for
this cause I gave unto you a commandment that you should call your
solemn assembly, that your fastings and your mourning might come up into
the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, which is by interpretation, the creator
of the first day, the beginning and the end.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:8">95:8</span></span> Yea, verily
I say unto you, I gave unto you a commandment that you should build a
house, in the which house I design to endow those whom I have chosen
with power from on high;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:9">95:9</span></span> For this is
the promise of the Father unto you; therefore I command you to tarry,
even as mine apostles at Jerusalem.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:10">95:10</span></span>
Nevertheless, my servants sinned a very grievous sin; and contentions
arose in the school of the prophets; which was very grievous unto me,
saith your Lord; therefore I sent them forth to be chastened.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:11">95:11</span></span> Verily I
say unto you, it is my will that you should build a house. If you keep
my commandments you shall have power to build it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:12">95:12</span></span> If you
keep not my commandments, the love of the Father shall not continue with
you, therefore you shall walk in darkness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:13">95:13</span></span> Now here
is wisdom, and the mind of the Lord—let the house be built, not after
the manner of the world, for I give not unto you that ye shall live
after the manner of the world;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:14">95:14</span></span>
Therefore, let it be built after the manner which I shall show unto
three of you, whom ye shall appoint and ordain unto this power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:15">95:15</span></span> And the
size thereof shall be fifty and five feet in width, and let it be
sixty-five feet in length, in the inner court thereof.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:16">95:16</span></span> And let
the lower part of the inner court be dedicated unto me for your
sacrament offering, and for your preaching, and your fasting, and your
praying, and the offering up of your most holy desires unto me, saith
your Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95:17">95:17</span></span> And let
the higher part of the inner court be dedicated unto me for the school
of mine apostles, saith Son Ahman; or, in other words, Alphus; or, in
other words, Omegus; even Jesus Christ your Lord. Amen.
