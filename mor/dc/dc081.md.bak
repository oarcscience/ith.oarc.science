### 81. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Hiram, Ohio, March 1832. * History of the Church* 1:257-58.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_81:1">81:1</span></span> Verily,
verily, I say unto you my servant Frederick G. Williams: Listen to the
voice of him who speaketh, to the word of the Lord your God, and hearken
to the calling wherewith you are called, even to be a high priest in my
church, and a counselor unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_81:2">81:2</span></span> Unto whom I
have given the keys of the kingdom, which belong always unto the
Presidency of the High Priesthood:

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_81:3">81:3</span></span> Therefore,
verily I acknowledge him and will bless him, and also thee, inasmuch as
thou art faithful in counsel, in the office which I have appointed unto
you, in prayer always, vocally and in thy heart, in public and in
private, also in thy ministry in proclaiming the gospel in the land of
the living, and among thy brethren.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_81:4">81:4</span></span> And in
doing these things thou wilt do the greatest good unto thy fellow
beings, and wilt promote the glory of him who is your Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_81:5">81:5</span></span> Wherefore,
be faithful; stand in the office which I have appointed unto you; succor
the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble
knees.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_81:6">81:6</span></span> And if thou
art faithful unto the end thou shalt have a crown of immortality, and
eternal life in the mansions which I have prepared in the house of my
Father.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_81:7">81:7</span></span> Behold, and
lo, these are the words of Alpha and Omega, even Jesus Christ. Amen.
