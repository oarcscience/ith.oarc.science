### 73. Revelation to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, Hiram, Ohio, January 10, 1832. * History of the Church* 1:241-42.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_73:1">73:1</span></span> For verily,
thus saith the Lord, it is expedient in me that they should continue
preaching the gospel, and in exhortation to the churches in the regions
round about, until conference;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_73:2">73:2</span></span> And then,
behold, it shall be made known unto them, by the voice of the
conference, their several missions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_73:3">73:3</span></span> Now, verily
I say unto you my servants, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, saith
the Lord, it is expedient to translate again;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_73:4">73:4</span></span> And,
inasmuch as it is practicable, to preach in the regions round about
until conference; and after that it is expedient to continue the work of
translation until it be finished.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_73:5">73:5</span></span> And let
this be a pattern unto the elders until further knowledge, even as it is
written.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_73:6">73:6</span></span> Now I give
no more unto you at this time. Gird up your loins and be sober. Even so.
Amen.
