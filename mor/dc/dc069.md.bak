### 69. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Hiram, Ohio, November 1831. * History of the Church* 1:234-35.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_69:1">69:1</span></span> Hearken
unto me, saith the Lord your God, for my servant Oliver Cowdery's sake.
It is not wisdom in me that he should be entrusted with the commandments
and the moneys which he shall carry unto the land of Zion, except one go
with him who will be true and faithful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_69:2">69:2</span></span> Wherefore,
I, the Lord, will that my servant, John Whitmer, should go with my
servant Oliver Cowdery;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_69:3">69:3</span></span> And also
that he shall continue in writing and making a history of all the
important things which he shall observe and know concerning my church;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_69:4">69:4</span></span> And also
that he receive counsel and assistance from my servant Oliver Cowdery
and others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_69:5">69:5</span></span> And also,
my servants who are abroad in the earth should send forth the accounts
of their stewardships to the land of Zion;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_69:6">69:6</span></span> For the
land of Zion shall be a seat and a place to receive and do all these
things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_69:7">69:7</span></span>
Nevertheless, let my servant John Whitmer travel many times from place
to place, and from church to church, that he may the more easily obtain
knowledge—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_69:8">69:8</span></span> Preaching
and expounding, writing, copying, selecting, and obtaining all things
which shall be for the good of the church, and for the rising
generations that shall grow up on the land of Zion, to possess it from
generation to generation, forever and ever. Amen.
