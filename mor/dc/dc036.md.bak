### 36. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Edward Partridge, near Fayette, New York, December 1830. * History of the Church* 1:131.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_36:1">36:1</span></span> Thus saith
the Lord God, the Mighty One of Israel: Behold, I say unto you, my
servant Edward, that you are blessed, and your sins are forgiven you,
and you are called to preach my gospel as with the voice of a trump;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_36:2">36:2</span></span> And I will
lay my hand upon you by the hand of my servant Sidney Rigdon, and you
shall receive my Spirit, the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which shall
teach you the peaceable things of the kingdom;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_36:3">36:3</span></span> And you
shall declare it with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna, blessed be the name
of the most high God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_36:4">36:4</span></span> And now
this calling and commandment give I unto you concerning all men—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_36:5">36:5</span></span> That as
many as shall come before my servants Sidney Rigdon and Joseph Smith,
Jun., embracing this calling and commandment, shall be ordained and sent
forth to preach the everlasting gospel among the nations—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_36:6">36:6</span></span> Crying
repentance, saying: Save yourselves from this untoward generation, and
come forth out of the fire, hating even the garments spotted with the
flesh.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_36:7">36:7</span></span> And this
commandment shall be given unto the elders of my church, that every man
which will embrace it with singleness of heart may be ordained and sent
forth, even as I have spoken.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_36:8">36:8</span></span> I am Jesus
Christ, the Son of God; wherefore, gird up your loins and I will
suddenly come to my temple. Even so. Amen.
