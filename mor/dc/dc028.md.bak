### 28. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Oliver Cowdery, Fayette, New York, September 1830. * History of the Church* 1:109-11.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:1">28:1</span></span> Behold, I
say unto thee, Oliver, that it shall be given unto thee that thou shalt
be heard by the church in all things whatsoever thou shalt teach them by
the Comforter, concerning the revelations and commandments which I have
given.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:2">28:2</span></span> But,
behold, verily, verily, I say unto thee, no one shall be appointed to
receive commandments and revelations in this church excepting my servant
Joseph Smith, Jun., for he receiveth them even as Moses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:3">28:3</span></span> And thou
shalt be obedient unto the things which I shall give unto him, even as
Aaron, to declare faithfully the commandments and the revelations, with
power and authority unto the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:4">28:4</span></span> And if thou
art led at any time by the Comforter to speak or teach, or at all times
by the way of commandment unto the church, thou mayest do it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:5">28:5</span></span> But thou
shalt not write by way of commandment, but by wisdom;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:6">28:6</span></span> And thou
shalt not command him who is at thy head, and at the head of the church;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:7">28:7</span></span> For I have
given him the keys of the mysteries, and the revelations which are
sealed, until I shall appoint unto them another in his stead.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:8">28:8</span></span> And now,
behold, I say unto you that you shall go unto the Lamanites and preach
my gospel unto them; and inasmuch as they receive thy teachings thou
shalt cause my church to be established among them; and thou shalt have
revelations, but write them not by way of commandment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:9">28:9</span></span> And now,
behold, I say unto you that it is not revealed, and no man knoweth where
the city Zion shall be built, but it shall be given hereafter. Behold, I
say unto you that it shall be on the borders by the Lamanites.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:10">28:10</span></span> Thou
shalt not leave this place until after the conference; and my servant
Joseph shall be appointed to preside over the conference by the voice of
it, and what he saith to thee thou shalt tell.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:11">28:11</span></span> And
again, thou shalt take thy brother, Hiram Page, between him and thee
alone, and tell him that those things which he hath written from that
stone are not of me and that Satan deceiveth him;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:12">28:12</span></span> For,
behold, these things have not been appointed unto him, neither shall
anything be appointed unto any of this church contrary to the church
covenants.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:13">28:13</span></span> For all
things must be done in order, and by common consent in the church, by
the prayer of faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:14">28:14</span></span> And thou
shalt assist to settle all these things, according to the covenants of
the church, before thou shalt take thy journey among the Lamanites.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:15">28:15</span></span> And it
shall be given thee from the time thou shalt go, until the time thou
shalt return, what thou shalt do.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28:16">28:16</span></span> And thou
must open thy mouth at all times, declaring my gospel with the sound of
rejoicing. Amen.
