### 103. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Kirtland, Ohio, February 24, 1834. * History of the Church* 2:36-39.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:1">103:1</span></span> Verily I
say unto you, my friends, behold, I will give unto you a revelation and
commandment, that you may know how to act in the discharge of your
duties concerning the salvation and redemption of your brethren, who
have been scattered on the land of Zion;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:2">103:2</span></span> Being
driven and smitten by the hands of mine enemies, on whom I will pour out
my wrath without measure in mine own time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:3">103:3</span></span> For I
have suffered them thus far, that they might fill up the measure of
their iniquities, that their cup might be full;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:4">103:4</span></span> And that
those who call themselves after my name might be chastened for a little
season with a sore and grievous chastisement, because they did not
hearken altogether unto the precepts and commandments which I gave unto
them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:5">103:5</span></span> But
verily I say unto you, that I have decreed a decree which my people
shall realize, inasmuch as they hearken from this very hour unto the
counsel which I, the Lord their God, shall give unto them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:6">103:6</span></span> Behold
they shall, for I have decreed it, begin to prevail against mine enemies
from this very hour.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:7">103:7</span></span> And by
hearkening to observe all the words which I, the Lord their God, shall
speak unto them, they shall never cease to prevail until the kingdoms of
the world are subdued under my feet, and the earth is given unto the
saints, to possess it forever and ever.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:8">103:8</span></span> But
inasmuch as they keep not my commandments, and hearken not to observe
all my words, the kingdoms of the world shall prevail against them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:9">103:9</span></span> For they
were set to be a light unto the world, and to be the saviors of men;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:10">103:10</span></span> And
inasmuch as they are not the saviors of men, they are as salt that has
lost its savor, and is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out
and trodden under foot of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:11">103:11</span></span> But
verily I say unto you, I have decreed that your brethren which have been
scattered shall return to the lands of their inheritances, and shall
build up the waste places of Zion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:12">103:12</span></span> For
after much tribulation, as I have said unto you in a former commandment,
cometh the blessing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:13">103:13</span></span> Behold,
this is the blessing which I have promised after your tribulations, and
the tribulations of your brethren—your redemption, and the redemption of
your brethren, even their restoration to the land of Zion, to be
established, no more to be thrown down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:14">103:14</span></span>
Nevertheless, if they pollute their inheritances they shall be thrown
down; for I will not spare them if they pollute their inheritances.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:15">103:15</span></span> Behold,
I say unto you, the redemption of Zion must needs come by power;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:16">103:16</span></span>
Therefore, I will raise up unto my people a man, who shall lead them
like as Moses led the children of Israel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:17">103:17</span></span> For ye
are the children of Israel, and of the seed of Abraham, and ye must
needs be led out of bondage by power, and with a stretched-out arm.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:18">103:18</span></span> And as
your fathers were led at the first, even so shall the redemption of Zion
be.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:19">103:19</span></span>
Therefore, let not your hearts faint, for I say not unto you as I said
unto your fathers: Mine angel shall go up before you, but not my
presence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:20">103:20</span></span> But I
say unto you: Mine angels shall go up before you, and also my presence,
and in time ye shall possess the goodly land.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:21">103:21</span></span> Verily,
verily I say unto you, that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun. is the man to
whom I likened the servant to whom the Lord of the vineyard spake in the
parable which I have given unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:22">103:22</span></span>
Therefore let my servant Joseph Smith, Jun. say unto the strength of my
house, my young men and the middle aged—Gather yourselves together unto
the land of Zion, upon the land which I have bought with money that has
been consecrated unto me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:23">103:23</span></span> And let
all the churches send up wise men with their moneys, and purchase lands
even as I have commanded them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:24">103:24</span></span> And
inasmuch as mine enemies come against you to drive you from my goodly
land, which I have consecrated to be the land of Zion, even from your
own lands after these testimonies, which ye have brought before me
against them, ye shall curse them;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:25">103:25</span></span> And
whomsoever ye curse, I will curse, and ye shall avenge me of mine
enemies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:26">103:26</span></span> And my
presence shall be with you even in avenging me of mine enemies, unto the
third and fourth generation of them that hate me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:27">103:27</span></span> Let no
man be afraid to lay down his life for my sake; for whoso layeth down
his life for my sake shall find it again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:28">103:28</span></span> And
whoso is not willing to lay down his life for my sake is not my
disciple.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:29">103:29</span></span> It is
my will that my servant Sidney Rigdon shall lift up his voice in the
congregations in the eastern countries, in preparing the churches to
keep the commandments which I have given unto them concerning the
restoration and redemption of Zion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:30">103:30</span></span> It is
my will that my servant Parley P. Pratt and my servant Lyman Wight
should not return to the land of their brethren, until they have
obtained companies to go up unto the land of Zion, by tens, or by
twenties, or by fifties, or by an hundred, until they have obtained to
the number of five hundred of the strength of my house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:31">103:31</span></span> Behold
this is my will; ask and ye shall receive; but men do not always do my
will.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:32">103:32</span></span>
Therefore, if you cannot obtain five hundred, seek diligently that
peradventure you may obtain three hundred.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:33">103:33</span></span> And if
ye cannot obtain three hundred, seek diligently that peradventure ye may
obtain one hundred.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:34">103:34</span></span> But
verily I say unto you, a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall not
go up unto the land of Zion until you have obtained a hundred of the
strength of my house, to go up with you unto the land of Zion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:35">103:35</span></span>
Therefore, as I said unto you, ask and ye shall receive; pray earnestly
that peradventure my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., may go with you, and
preside in the midst of my people, and organize my kingdom upon the
consecrated land, and establish the children of Zion upon the laws and
commandments which have been and which shall be given unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:36">103:36</span></span> All
victory and glory is brought to pass unto you through your diligence,
faithfulness, and prayers of faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:37">103:37</span></span> Let my
servant Parley P. Pratt journey with my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:38">103:38</span></span> Let my
servant Lyman Wight journey with my servant Sidney Rigdon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:39">103:39</span></span> Let my
servant Hyrum Smith journey with my servant Frederick G. Williams.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_103:40">103:40</span></span> Let my
servant Orson Hyde journey with my servant Orson Pratt, whithersoever my
servant Joseph Smith, Jun., shall counsel them, in obtaining the
fulfilment of these commandments which I have given unto you, and leave
the residue in my hands. Even so. Amen.
