### 13. Ordination of Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery to the Aaronic Priesthood on the banks of the Susquehanna River near Harmony, Pennsylvania, May 15, 1829. * History of the Church* 1:39-42.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_13:1">13:1</span></span> Upon you my
fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of
Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the
gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of
sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth, until the sons
of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.
