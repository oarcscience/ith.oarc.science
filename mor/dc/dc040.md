Saints*, at Intangible Textual Heritage

### 40. Revelation to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, Fayette, New York, January 1831. * History of the Church* 1:145.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40:1">40:1</span></span> Behold,
verily I say unto you, that the heart of my servant James Covill was
right before me, for he covenanted with me that he would obey my word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40:2">40:2</span></span> And he
received the word with gladness, but straightway Satan tempted him; and
the fear of persecution and the cares of the world caused him to reject
the word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40:3">40:3</span></span> Wherefore
he broke my covenant, and it remaineth with me to do with him as seemeth
me good. Amen.
