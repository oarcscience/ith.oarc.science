### 129. Instructions given by Joseph Smith, Nauvoo, Illinois, February 9, 1843. * History of the Church* 5:267.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_129:1">129:1</span></span> There are
two kinds of beings in heaven, namely: Angels, who are resurrected
personages, having bodies of flesh and bones—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_129:2">129:2</span></span> For
instance, Jesus said: *Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not* *flesh
and bones, as ye see me have.*

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_129:3">129:3</span></span> Secondly:
the spirits of just men made perfect, they who are not resurrected, but
inherit the same glory.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_129:4">129:4</span></span> When a
messenger comes saying he has a message from God, offer him your hand
and request him to shake hands with you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_129:5">129:5</span></span> If he be
an angel he will do so, and you will feel his hand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_129:6">129:6</span></span> If he be
the spirit of a just man made perfect he will come in his glory; for
that is the only way he can appear—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_129:7">129:7</span></span> Ask him
to shake hands with you, but he will not move, because it is contrary to
the order of heaven for a just man to deceive; but he will still deliver
his message.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_129:8">129:8</span></span> If it be
the devil as an angel of light, when you ask him to shake hands he will
offer you his hand, and you will not feel anything; you may therefore
detect him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_129:9">129:9</span></span> These are
three grand keys whereby you may know whether any administration is from
God.
