### 115. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Far West, Missouri, April 26, 1838. * History of the Church* 3:23-25.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:1">115:1</span></span> Verily
thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and also my
servant Sidney Rigdon, and also my servant Hyrum Smith, and your
counselors who are and shall be appointed hereafter;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:2">115:2</span></span> And also
unto you, my servant Edward Partridge, and his counselors;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:3">115:3</span></span> And also
unto my faithful servants who are of the high council of my church in
Zion, for thus it shall be called, and unto all the elders and people of
my Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, scattered abroad in all
the world;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:4">115:4</span></span> For thus
shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:5">115:5</span></span> Verily I
say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a
standard for the nations;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:6">115:6</span></span> And that
the gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her stakes, may
be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when
it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:7">115:7</span></span> Let the
city, Far West, be a holy and consecrated land unto me; and it shall be
called most holy, for the ground upon which thou standest is holy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:8">115:8</span></span>
Therefore, I command you to build a house unto me, for the gathering
together of my saints, that they may worship me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:9">115:9</span></span> And let
there be a beginning of this work, and a foundation, and a preparatory
work, this following summer;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:10">115:10</span></span> And let
the beginning be made on the fourth day of July next; and from that time
forth let my people labor diligently to build a house unto my name;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:11">115:11</span></span> And in
one year from this day let them re-commence laying the foundation of my
house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:12">115:12</span></span> Thus
let them from that time forth labor diligently until it shall be
finished, from the corner stone thereof unto the top thereof, until
there shall not anything remain that is not finished.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:13">115:13</span></span> Verily
I say unto you, let not my servant Joseph, neither my servant Sidney,
neither my servant Hyrum, get in debt any more for the building of a
house unto my name;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:14">115:14</span></span> But let
a house be built unto my name according to the pattern which I will show
unto them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:15">115:15</span></span> And if
my people build it not according to the pattern which I shall show unto
their presidency, I will not accept it at their hands.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:16">115:16</span></span> But if
my people do build it according to the pattern which I shall show unto
their presidency, even my servant Joseph and his counselors, then I will
accept it at the hands of my people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:17">115:17</span></span> And
again, verily I say unto you, it is my will that the city of Far West
should be built up speedily by the gathering of my saints;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:18">115:18</span></span> And
also that other places should be appointed for stakes in the regions
round about, as they shall be manifested unto my servant Joseph, from
time to time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_115:19">115:19</span></span> For
behold, I will be with him, and I will sanctify him before the people;
for unto him have I given the keys of this kingdom and ministry. Even
so. Amen.
