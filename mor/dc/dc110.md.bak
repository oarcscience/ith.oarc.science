### 110. Visions given to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the temple at Kirtland, Ohio, April 3, 1836. * History of the Church* 2:435-36.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:1">110:1</span></span> The veil
was taken from our minds, and the eyes of our understanding were opened.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:2">110:2</span></span> We saw
the Lord standing upon the breastwork of the pulpit, before us; and
under his feet was a paved work of pure gold, in color like amber.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:3">110:3</span></span> His eyes
were as a flame of fire; the hair of his head was white like the pure
snow; his countenance shone above the brightness of the sun; and his
voice was as the sound of the rushing of great waters, even the voice of
Jehovah, saying:

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:4">110:4</span></span> I am the
first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your
advocate with the Father.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:5">110:5</span></span> Behold,
your sins are forgiven you; you are clean before me; therefore, lift up
your heads and rejoice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:6">110:6</span></span> Let the
hearts of your brethren rejoice, and let the hearts of all my people
rejoice, who have, with their might, built this house to my name.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:7">110:7</span></span> For
behold, I have accepted this house, and my name shall be here; and I
will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:8">110:8</span></span> Yea, I
will appear unto my servants, and speak unto them with mine own voice,
if my people will keep my commandments, and do not pollute this holy
house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:9">110:9</span></span> Yea the
hearts of thousands and tens of thousands shall greatly rejoice in
consequence of the blessings which shall be poured out, and the
endowment with which my servants have been endowed in this house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:10">110:10</span></span> And the
fame of this house shall spread to foreign lands; and this is the
beginning of the blessing which shall be poured out upon the heads of my
people. Even so. Amen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:11">110:11</span></span> After
this vision closed, the heavens were again opened unto us; and Moses
appeared before us, and committed unto us the keys of the gathering of
Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten
tribes from the land of the north.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:12">110:12</span></span> After
this, Elias appeared, and committed the dispensation of the gospel of
Abraham, saying that in us and our seed all generations after us should
be blessed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:13">110:13</span></span> After
this vision had closed, another great and glorious vision burst upon us;
for Elijah the prophet, who was taken to heaven without tasting death,
stood before us, and said:

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:14">110:14</span></span> Behold,
the time has fully come, which was spoken of by the mouth of
Malachi—testifying that he \[Elijah\] should be sent, before the great
and dreadful day of the Lord come—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:15">110:15</span></span> To turn
the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the children to the
fathers, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_110:16">110:16</span></span>
Therefore, the keys of this dispensation are committed into your hands;
and by this ye may know that the great and dreadful day of the Lord is
near, even at the doors.
