### 87. Revelation and prophecy on war, given through Joseph Smith, December 25, 1832. * History of the Church* 1:301-2.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_87:1">87:1</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord concerning the wars that will shortly come to pass,
beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina, which will eventually
terminate in the death and misery of many souls;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_87:2">87:2</span></span> And the
time will come that war will be poured out upon all nations, beginning
at this place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_87:3">87:3</span></span> For behold,
the Southern States shall be divided against the Northern States, and
the Southern States will call on other nations, even the nation of Great
Britain, as it is called, and they shall also call upon other nations,
in order to defend themselves against other nations; and then war shall
be poured out upon all nations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_87:4">87:4</span></span> And it
shall come to pass, after many days, slaves shall rise up against their
masters, who shall be marshaled and disciplined for war.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_87:5">87:5</span></span> And it
shall come to pass also that the remnants who are left of the land will
marshal themselves, and shall become exceedingly angry, and shall vex
the Gentiles with a sore vexation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_87:6">87:6</span></span> And thus,
with the sword and by bloodshed the inhabitants of the earth shall
mourn; and with famine, and plague, and earthquake, and the thunder of
heaven, and the fierce and vivid lightning also, shall the inhabitants
of the earth be made to feel the wrath, and indignation, and chastening
hand of an Almighty God, until the consumption decreed hath made a full
end of all nations;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_87:7">87:7</span></span> That the
cry of the saints, and of the blood of the saints, shall cease to come
up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, from the earth, to be avenged
of their enemies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_87:8">87:8</span></span> Wherefore,
stand ye in holy places, and be not moved, until the day of the Lord
come; for behold, it cometh quickly, saith the Lord. Amen.
