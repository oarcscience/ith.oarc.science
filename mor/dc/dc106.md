### 106. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Kirtland, Ohio, November 25, 1834. * History of the Church* 2:170-71.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_106:1">106:1</span></span> It is my
will that my servant Warren A. Cowdery should be appointed and ordained
a presiding high priest over my church, in the land of Freedom and the
regions round about;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_106:2">106:2</span></span> And
should preach my everlasting gospel, and lift up his voice and warn the
people, not only in his own place, but in the adjoining counties;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_106:3">106:3</span></span> And
devote his whole time to this high and holy calling, which I now give
unto him, seeking diligently the kingdom of heaven and its
righteousness, and all things necessary shall be added thereunto; for
the laborer is worthy of his hire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_106:4">106:4</span></span> And
again, verily I say unto you, the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, and
it overtaketh the world as a thief in the night—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_106:5">106:5</span></span>
Therefore, gird up your loins, that you may be the children of light,
and that day shall not overtake you as a thief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_106:6">106:6</span></span> And
again, verily I say unto you, there was joy in heaven when my servant
Warren bowed to my scepter, and separated himself from the crafts of
men;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_106:7">106:7</span></span>
Therefore, blessed is my servant Warren, for I will have mercy on him;
and, notwithstanding the vanity of his heart, I will lift him up
inasmuch as he will humble himself before me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_106:8">106:8</span></span> And I
will give him grace and assurance wherewith he may stand; and if he
continue to be a faithful witness and a light unto the church I have
prepared a crown for him in the mansions of my Father. Even so. Amen.
