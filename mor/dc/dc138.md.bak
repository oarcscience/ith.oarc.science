### 138. A vision given to President Joseph F. Smith, Salt Lake City, Utah, October 3, 1918.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:1">138:1</span></span> On the
third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I sat in my
room pondering over the scriptures;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:2">138:2</span></span> And
reflecting upon the great atoning sacrifice that was made by the Son of
God, for the redemption of the world;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:3">138:3</span></span> And the
great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father and the Son in the
coming of the Redeemer into the world;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:4">138:4</span></span> That
through his atonement, and by obedience to the principles of the gospel,
mankind might be saved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:5">138:5</span></span> While I
was thus engaged, my mind reverted to the writings of the apostle Peter,
to the primitive saints scattered abroad throughout Pontus, Galatia,
Cappadocia, and other parts of Asia, where the gospel had been preached
after t he crucifixion of the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:6">138:6</span></span> I opened
the Bible and read the third and fourth chapters of the first epistle of
Peter, and as I read I was greatly impressed, more than I had ever been
before, with the following passages:

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:7">138:7</span></span> "For
Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that
he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened
by the Spirit:

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:8">138:8</span></span> "By which
also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:9">138:9</span></span> "Which
sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in
the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is,
eight souls were saved by water." (1 Peter 3:18-20.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:10">138:10</span></span> "For
for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that
they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according
to God in the spirit." (1 Peter 4:6.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:11">138:11</span></span> As I
pondered over these things which are written, the eyes of my
understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me,
and I saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:12">138:12</span></span> And
there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of the
spirits of the just, who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus
while they lived in mortality;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:13">138:13</span></span> And who
had offered sacrifice in the similitude of the great sacrifice of the
Son of God, and had suffered tribulation in their Redeemer's name.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:14">138:14</span></span> All
these had departed the mortal life, firm in the hope of a glorious
resurrection, through the grace of God the Father and his Only Begotten
Son, Jesus Christ.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:15">138:15</span></span> I
beheld that they were filled with joy and gladness, and were rejoicing
together because the day of their deliverance was at hand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:16">138:16</span></span> They
were assembled awaiting the advent of the Son of God into the spirit
world, to declare their redemption from the bands of death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:17">138:17</span></span> Their
sleeping dust was to be restored unto its perfect frame, bone to his
bone, and the sinews and the flesh upon them, the spirit and the body to
be united never again to be divided, that they might receive a fulness
of joy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:18">138:18</span></span> While
this vast multitude waited and conversed, rejoicing in the hour of their
deliverance from the chains of death, the Son of God appeared, declaring
liberty to the captives who had been faithful;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:19">138:19</span></span> And
there he preached to them the everlasting gospel, the doctrine of the
resurrection and the redemption of mankind from the fall, and from
individual sins on conditions of repentance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:20">138:20</span></span> But
unto the wicked he did not go, and among the ungodly and the unrepentant
who had defiled themselves while in the flesh, his voice was not raised;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:21">138:21</span></span> Neither
did the rebellious who rejected the testimonies and the warnings of the
ancient prophets behold his presence, nor look upon his face.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:22">138:22</span></span> Where
these were, darkness reigned, but among the righteous there was peace;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:23">138:23</span></span> And the
saints rejoiced in their redemption, and bowed the knee and acknowledged
the Son of God as their Redeemer and Deliverer from death and the chains
of hell.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:24">138:24</span></span> Their
countenances shone, and the radiance from the presence of the Lord
rested upon them, and they sang praises unto his holy name.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:25">138:25</span></span> I
marveled, for I understood that the Savior spent about three years in
his ministry among the Jews and those of the house of Israel,
endeavoring to teach them the everlasting gospel and call them unto
repentance;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:26">138:26</span></span> And
yet, notwithstanding his mighty works, and miracles, and proclamation of
the truth, in great power and authority, there were but few who
hearkened to his voice, and rejoiced in his presence, and received
salvation at his ha nds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:27">138:27</span></span> But his
ministry among those who were dead was limited to the brief time
intervening between the crucifixion and his resurrection;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:28">138:28</span></span> And I
wondered at the words of Peterwwherein he said that the Son of God
preached unto the spirits in prison, who sometime were disobedient, when
once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noahwand how it was
possible for him to preach to those spirits and perform the necessary
labor among them in so short a time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:29">138:29</span></span> And as
I wondered, my eyes were opened, and my understanding quickened, and I
perceived that the Lord went not in person among the wicked and the
disobedient who had rejected the truth, to teach them;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:30">138:30</span></span> But
behold, from among the righteous, he organized his forces and appointed
messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to
go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in
darkness, even t o all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel
preached to the dead.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:31">138:31</span></span> And the
chosen messengers went forth to declare the acceptable day of the Lord
and proclaim liberty to the captives who were bound, even unto all who
would repent of their sins and receive the gospel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:32">138:32</span></span> Thus
was the gospel preached to those who had died in their sins, without a
knowledge of the truth, or in transgression, having rejected the
prophets.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:33">138:33</span></span> These
were taught faith in God, repentance from sin, vicarious baptism for the
remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:34">138:34</span></span> And all
other principles of the gospel that were necessary for them to know in
order to qualify themselves that they might be judged according to men
in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:35">138:35</span></span> And so
it was made known among the dead, both small and great, the unrighteous
as well as the faithful, that redemption had been wrought through the
sacrifice of the Son of God upon the cross.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:36">138:36</span></span> Thus
was it made known that our Redeemer spent his time during his sojourn in
the world of spirits, instructing and preparing the faithful spirits of
the prophets who had testified of him in the flesh;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:37">138:37</span></span> That
they might carry the message of redemption unto all the dead, unto whom
he could not go personally, because of their rebellion and
transgression, that they through the ministration of his servants might
also hear his words .

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:38">138:38</span></span> Among
the great and mighty ones who were assembled in this vast congregation
of the righteous were Father Adam, the Ancient of Days and father of
all,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:39">138:39</span></span> And our
glorious Mother Eve, with many of her faithful daughters who had lived
through the ages and worshiped the true and living God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:40">138:40</span></span> Abel,
the first martyr, was there, and his brother Seth, one of the mighty
ones, who was in the express image of his father, Adam.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:41">138:41</span></span> Noah,
who gave warning of the flood; Shem, the great high priest; Abraham, the
father of the faithful; Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, the great law-giver of
Israel;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:42">138:42</span></span> And
Isaiah, who declared by prophecy that the Redeemer was anointed to bind
up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the
opening of the prison to them that were bound, were also there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:43">138:43</span></span>
Moreover, Ezekiel, who was shown in vision the great valley of dry
bones, which were to be clothed upon with flesh, to come forth again in
the resurrection of the dead, living souls;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:44">138:44</span></span> Daniel,
who foresaw and foretold the establishment of the kingdom of God in the
latter days, never again to be destroyed nor given to other people;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:45">138:45</span></span> Elias,
who was with Moses on the Mount of Transfiguration;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:46">138:46</span></span> And
Malachi, the prophet who testified of the coming of Elijahwof whom also
Moroni spake to the Prophet Joseph Smith, declaring that he should come
before the ushering in of the great and dreadful day of the Lordwwere
also ther e.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:47">138:47</span></span> The
Prophet Elijah was to plant in the hearts of the children the promises
made to their fathers,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:48">138:48</span></span>
Foreshadowing the great work to be done in the temples of the Lord in
the dispensation of the fulness of times, for the redemption of the
dead, and the sealing of the children to their parents, lest the whole
earth be smitten w ith a curse and utterly wasted at his coming.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:49">138:49</span></span> All
these and many more, even the prophets who dwelt among the Nephites and
testified of the coming of the Son of God, mingled in the vast assembly
and waited for their deliverance,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:50">138:50</span></span> For the
dead had looked upon the long absence of their spirits from their bodies
as a bondage.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:51">138:51</span></span> These
the Lord taught, and gave them power to come forth, after his
resurrection from the dead, to enter into his Father's kingdom, there to
be crowned with immortality and eternal life,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:52">138:52</span></span> And
continue thenceforth their labor as had been promised by the Lord, and
be partakers of all blessings which were held in reserve for them that
love him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:53">138:53</span></span> The
Prophet Joseph Smith, and my father, Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, John
Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and other choice spirits who were reserved to
come forth in the fulness of times to take part in laying the
foundations of the great latter-day work,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:54">138:54</span></span>
Including the building of the temples and the performance of ordinances
therein for the redemption of the dead, were also in the spirit world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:55">138:55</span></span> I
observed that they were also among the noble and great ones who were
chosen in the beginning to be rulers in the Church of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:56">138:56</span></span> Even
before they were born, they, with many others, received their first
lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the
due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the
souls of men .

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:57">138:57</span></span> I
beheld that the faithful elders of this dispensation, when they depart
from mortal life, continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel
of repentance and redemption, through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten
Son of God , among those who are in darkness and under the bondage of
sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:58">138:58</span></span> The
dead who repent will be redeemed, through obedience to the ordinances of
the house of God,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:59">138:59</span></span> And
after they have paid the penalty of their transgressions, and are washed
clean, shall receive a reward according to their works, for they are
heirs of salvation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138:60">138:60</span></span> Thus
was the vision of the redemption of the dead revealed to me, and I bear
record, and I know that this record is true, through the blessing of our
Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, even so. Amen.
