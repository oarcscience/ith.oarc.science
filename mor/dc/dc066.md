### 66. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Orange, Ohio, October 25, 1831. * History of the Church* 1:219-21.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_66:1">66:1</span></span> Behold,
thus saith the Lord unto my servant William E. McLellin—Blessed are you,
inasmuch as you have turned away from your iniquities, and have received
my truths, saith the Lord your Redeemer, the Savior of the world, even
of as many as believe on my name.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_66:2">66:2</span></span> Verily I
say unto you, blessed are you for receiving mine everlasting covenant,
even the fulness of my gospel, sent forth unto the children of men, that
they might have life and be made partakers of the glories which are to
be revealed in the last days, as it was written by the prophets and
apostles in days of old.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_66:3">66:3</span></span> Verily I
say unto you, my servant William, that you are clean, but not all;
repent, therefore, of those things which are not pleasing in my sight,
saith the Lord, for the Lord will show them unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_66:4">66:4</span></span> And now,
verily, I, the Lord, will show unto you what I will concerning you, or
what is my will concerning you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_66:5">66:5</span></span> Behold,
verily I say unto you, that it is my will that you should proclaim my
gospel from land to land, and from city to city, yea, in those regions
round about where it has not been proclaimed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_66:6">66:6</span></span> Tarry not
many days in this place; go not up unto the land of Zion as yet; but
inasmuch as you can send, send; otherwise, think not of thy property.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_66:7">66:7</span></span> Go unto the
eastern lands, bear testimony in every place, unto every people and in
their synagogues, reasoning with the people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_66:8">66:8</span></span> Let my
servant Samuel H. Smith go with you, and forsake him not, and give him
thine instructions; and he that is faithful shall be made strong in
every place; and I, the Lord, will go with you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_66:9">66:9</span></span> Lay your
hands upon the sick, and they shall recover. Return not till I, the
Lord, shall send you. Be patient in affliction. Ask, and ye shall
receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_66:10">66:10</span></span> Seek not
to be cumbered. Forsake all unrighteousness. Commit not adultery—a
temptation with which thou hast been troubled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_66:11">66:11</span></span> Keep
these sayings, for they are true and faithful; and thou shalt magnify
thine office, and push many people to Zion with songs of everlasting joy
upon their heads.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_66:12">66:12</span></span> Continue
in these things even unto the end, and you shall have a crown of eternal
life at the right hand of my Father, who is full of grace and truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_66:13">66:13</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord your God, your Redeemer, even Jesus Christ. Amen.
