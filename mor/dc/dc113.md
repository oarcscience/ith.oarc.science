### 113. Joseph Smith's answers to questions on the writings of Isaiah, March 1838. * History of the Church* 3:9-10.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_113:1">113:1</span></span> Who is
the Stem of Jesse spoken of in the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th verses of
the 11th chapter of Isaiah?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_113:2">113:2</span></span> Verily
thus saith the Lord: It is Christ.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_113:3">113:3</span></span> What is
the rod spoken of in the first verse of the 11th chapter of Isaiah, that
should come of the Stem of Jesse?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_113:4">113:4</span></span> Behold,
thus saith the Lord: It is a servant in the hands of Christ, who is
partly a descendant of Jesse as well as of Ephraim, or of the house of
Joseph, on whom there is laid much power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_113:5">113:5</span></span> What is
the root of Jesse spoken of in the 10th verse of the 11th chapter?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_113:6">113:6</span></span> Behold,
thus saith the Lord, it is a descendant of Jesse, as well as of Joseph,
unto whom rightly belongs the priesthood, and the keys of the kingdom,
for an ensign, and for the gathering of my people in the last days.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_113:7">113:7</span></span> Questions
by Elias Higbee: What is meant by the command in Isaiah, 52d chapter,
1st verse, which saith: Put on thy strength, O Zion—and what people had
Isaiah reference to?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_113:8">113:8</span></span> He had
reference to those whom God should call in the last days, who should
hold the power of priesthood to bring again Zion, and the redemption of
Israel; and to put on her strength is to put on the authority of the
priesthood, which she, Zion, has a right to by lineage; also to return
to that power which she had lost.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_113:9">113:9</span></span> What are
we to understand by Zion loosing herself from the bands of her neck; 2d
verse?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_113:10">113:10</span></span> We are
to understand that the scattered remnants are exhorted to return to the
Lord from whence they have fallen; which if they do, the promise of the
Lord is that he will speak to them, or give them revelation. See the
6th, 7th, and 8th verses. The bands of her neck are the curses of God
upon her, or the remnants of Israel in their scattered condition among
the Gentiles.
