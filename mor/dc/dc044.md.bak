### 44. Revelation to Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, Kirtland, Ohio, February 1831. * History of the Church* 1:157.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_44:1">44:1</span></span> Behold,
thus saith the Lord unto you my servants, it is expedient in me that the
elders of my church should be called together, from the east and from
the west, and from the north and from the south, by letter or some other
way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_44:2">44:2</span></span> And it
shall come to pass, that inasmuch as they are faithful, and exercise
faith in me, I will pour out my Spirit upon them in the day that they
assemble themselves together.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_44:3">44:3</span></span> And it
shall come to pass that they shall go forth into the regions round
about, and preach repentance unto the people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_44:4">44:4</span></span> And many
shall be converted, insomuch that ye shall obtain power to organize
yourselves according to the laws of man;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_44:5">44:5</span></span> That your
enemies may not have power over you; that you may be preserved in all
things; that you may be enabled to keep my laws; that every bond may be
broken wherewith the enemy seeketh to destroy my people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_44:6">44:6</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you, that ye must visit the poor and the needy and administer
to their relief, that they may be kept until all things may be done
according to my law which ye have received. Amen.
