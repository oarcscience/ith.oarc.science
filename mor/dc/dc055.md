### 55. Revelation through Joseph Smith to William W. Phelps, Kirtland, Ohio, June 1831. * History of the Church* 1:184-86.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_55:1">55:1</span></span> Behold,
thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant William, yea, even the Lord of
the whole earth, thou art called and chosen; and after thou hast been
baptized by water, which if you do with an eye single to my glory, you
shall have a remission of your sins and a reception of the Holy Spirit
by the laying on of hands;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_55:2">55:2</span></span> And then
thou shalt be ordained by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., to
be an elder unto this church, to preach repentance and remission of sins
by way of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living
God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_55:3">55:3</span></span> And on
whomsoever you shall lay your hands, if they are contrite before me, you
shall have power to give the Holy Spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_55:4">55:4</span></span> And again,
you shall be ordained to assist my servant Oliver Cowdery to do the work
of printing, and of selecting and writing books for schools in this
church, that little children also may receive instruction before me as
is pleasing unto me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_55:5">55:5</span></span> And again,
verily I say unto you, for this cause you shall take your journey with
my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon, that you may be
planted in the land of your inheritance to do this work.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_55:6">55:6</span></span> And again,
let my servant Joseph Coe also take his journey with them. The residue
shall be made known hereafter, even as I will. Amen.
