### 54. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Newel Knight, Kirtland, Ohio, June 1831. * History of the Church* 1:180-81.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_54:1">54:1</span></span> Behold,
thus saith the Lord, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end,
even he who was crucified for the sins of the world—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_54:2">54:2</span></span> Behold,
verily, verily, I say unto you, my servant Newel Knight, you shall stand
fast in the office whereunto I have appointed you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_54:3">54:3</span></span> And if your
brethren desire to escape their enemies, let them repent of all their
sins, and become truly humble before me and contrite.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_54:4">54:4</span></span> And as the
covenant which they made unto me has been broken, even so it has become
void and of none effect.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_54:5">54:5</span></span> And wo to
him by whom this offense cometh, for it had been better for him that he
had been drowned in the depth of the sea.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_54:6">54:6</span></span> But blessed
are they who have kept the covenant and observed the commandment, for
they shall obtain mercy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_54:7">54:7</span></span> Wherefore,
go to now and flee the land, lest your enemies come upon you; and take
your journey, and appoint whom you will to be your leader, and to pay
moneys for you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_54:8">54:8</span></span> And thus
you shall take your journey into the regions westward, unto the land of
Missouri, unto the borders of the Lamanites.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_54:9">54:9</span></span> And after
you have done journeying, behold, I say unto you, seek ye a living like
unto men, until I prepare a place for you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_54:10">54:10</span></span> And
again, be patient in tribulation until I come; and, behold, I come
quickly, and my reward is with me, and they who have sought me early
shall find rest to their souls. Even so. Amen.
