### 67. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Hiram, Ohio, November 1831. * History of the Church* 1:224-25.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:1">67:1</span></span> Behold and
hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have assembled yourselves
together, whose prayers I have heard, and whose hearts I know, and whose
desires have come up before me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:2">67:2</span></span> Behold and
lo, mine eyes are upon you, and the heavens and the earth are in mine
hands, and the riches of eternity are mine to give.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:3">67:3</span></span> Ye
endeavored to believe that ye should receive the blessing which was
offered unto you; but behold, verily I say unto you there were fears in
your hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did not receive.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:4">67:4</span></span> And now I,
the Lord, give unto you a testimony of the truth of these commandments
which are lying before you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:5">67:5</span></span> Your eyes
have been upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and his language you have
known, and his imperfections you have known; and you have sought in your
hearts knowledge that you might express beyond his language; this you
also know.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:6">67:6</span></span> Now, seek
ye out of the Book of Commandments, even the least that is among them,
and appoint him that is the most wise among you;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:7">67:7</span></span> Or, if
there be any among you that shall make one like unto it, then ye are
justified in saying that ye do not know that they are true;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:8">67:8</span></span> But if ye
cannot make one like unto it, ye are under condemnation if ye do not
bear record that they are true.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:9">67:9</span></span> For ye know
that there is no unrighteousness in them, and that which is righteous
cometh down from above, from the Father of lights.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:10">67:10</span></span> And
again, verily I say unto you that it is your privilege, and a promise I
give unto you that have been ordained unto this ministry, that inasmuch
as you strip yourselves from jealousies and fears, and humble yourselves
before me, for ye are not sufficiently humble, the veil shall be rent
and you shall see me and know that I am—not with the carnal neither
natural mind, but with the spiritual.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:11">67:11</span></span> For no
man has seen God at any time in the flesh, except quickened by the
Spirit of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:12">67:12</span></span> Neither
can any natural man abide the presence of God, neither after the carnal
mind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:13">67:13</span></span> Ye are
not able to abide the presence of God now, neither the ministering of
angels; wherefore, continue in patience until ye are perfected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_67:14">67:14</span></span> Let not
your minds turn back; and when ye are worthy, in mine own due time, ye
shall see and know that which was conferred upon you by the hands of my
servant Joseph Smith, Jun. Amen.
