### 94. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Kirtland, Ohio, May 6, 1833. * History of the Church* 1:346-47.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:1">94:1</span></span> And again,
verily I say unto you, my friends, a commandment I give unto you, that
ye shall commence a work of laying out and preparing a beginning and
foundation of the city of the stake of Zion, here in the land of
Kirtland, beginning at my house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:2">94:2</span></span> And behold,
it must be done according to the pattern which I have given unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:3">94:3</span></span> And let the
first lot on the south be consecrated unto me for the building of a
house for the presidency, for the work of the presidency, in obtaining
revelations; and for the work of the ministry of the presidency, in all
things pertaining to the church and kingdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:4">94:4</span></span> Verily I
say unto you, that it shall be built fifty-five by sixty-five feet in
the width thereof and in the length thereof, in the inner court.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:5">94:5</span></span> And there
shall be a lower court and a higher court, according to the pattern
which shall be given unto you hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:6">94:6</span></span> And it
shall be dedicated unto the Lord from the foundation thereof, according
to the order of the priesthood, according to the pattern which shall be
given unto you hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:7">94:7</span></span> And it
shall be wholly dedicated unto the Lord for the work of the presidency.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:8">94:8</span></span> And ye
shall not suffer any unclean thing to come in unto it; and my glory
shall be there, and my presence shall be there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:9">94:9</span></span> But if
there shall come into it any unclean thing, my glory shall not be there;
and my presence shall not come into it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:10">94:10</span></span> And
again, verily I say unto you, the second lot on the south shall be
dedicated unto me for the building of a house unto me, for the work of
the printing of the translation of my scriptures, and all things
whatsoever I shall command you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:11">94:11</span></span> And it
shall be fifty-five by sixty-five feet in the width thereof and the
length thereof, in the inner court; and there shall be a lower and a
higher court.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:12">94:12</span></span> And this
house shall be wholly dedicated unto the Lord from the foundation
thereof, for the work of the printing, in all things whatsoever I shall
command you, to be holy, undefiled, according to the pattern in all
things as it shall be given unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:13">94:13</span></span> And on
the third lot shall my servant Hyrum Smith receive his inheritance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:14">94:14</span></span> And on
the first and second lots on the north shall my servants Reynolds Cahoon
and Jared Carter receive their inheritances—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:15">94:15</span></span> That they
may do the work which I have appointed unto them, to be a committee to
build mine houses, according to the commandment, which I, the Lord God,
have given unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:16">94:16</span></span> These two
houses are not to be built until I give unto you a commandment
concerning them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94:17">94:17</span></span> And now I
give unto you no more at this time. Amen.
