### 119. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Far West, Missouri, July 8, 1838. * History of the Church* 3:44.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_119:1">119:1</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord, I require all their surplus property to be put into
the hands of the bishop of my church in Zion,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_119:2">119:2</span></span> For the
building of mine house, and for the laying of the foundation of Zion and
for the priesthood, and for the debts of the Presidency of my Church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_119:3">119:3</span></span> And this
shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_119:4">119:4</span></span> And after
that, those who have thus been tithed shall pay one-tenth of all their
interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever,
for my holy priesthood, saith the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_119:5">119:5</span></span> Verily I
say unto you, it shall come to pass that all those who gather unto the
land of Zion shall be tithed of their surplus properties, and shall
observe this law, or they shall not be found worthy to abide among you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_119:6">119:6</span></span> And I say
unto you, if my people observe not this law, to keep it holy, and by
this law sanctify the land of Zion unto me, that my statutes and my
judgments may be kept thereon, that it may be most holy, behold, verily
I say unto you, it shall not be a land of Zion unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_119:7">119:7</span></span> And this
shall be an ensample unto all the stakes of Zion. Even so. Amen.
