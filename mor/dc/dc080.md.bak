### 80. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Hiram, Ohio, March 1832. * History of the Church* 1:257.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80:1">80:1</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Stephen Burnett: Go ye, go ye
into the world and preach the gospel to every creature that cometh under
the sound of your voice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80:2">80:2</span></span> And
inasmuch as you desire a companion, I will give unto you my servant Eden
Smith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80:3">80:3</span></span> Wherefore,
go ye and preach my gospel, whether to the north or to the south, to the
east or to the west, it mattereth not, for ye cannot go amiss.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80:4">80:4</span></span> Therefore,
declare the things which ye have heard, and verily believe, and know to
be true.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80:5">80:5</span></span> Behold,
this is the will of him who hath called you, your Redeemer, even Jesus
Christ. Amen.
