### 62. Revelation through Joseph Smith, on the bank of the Missouri River Chariton, Missouri, August 13, 1831. * History of the Church* 1:205-6.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_62:1">62:1</span></span> Behold, and
hearken, O ye elders of my church, saith the Lord your God, even Jesus
Christ, your advocate, who knoweth the weakness of man and how to succor
them who are tempted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_62:2">62:2</span></span> And verily
mine eyes are upon those who have not as yet gone up unto the land of
Zion; wherefore your mission is not yet full.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_62:3">62:3</span></span>
Nevertheless, ye are blessed, for the testimony which ye have borne is
recorded in heaven for the angels to look upon; and they rejoice over
you, and your sins are forgiven you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_62:4">62:4</span></span> And now
continue your journey. Assemble yourselves upon the land of Zion; and
hold a meeting and rejoice together, and offer a sacrament unto the Most
High.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_62:5">62:5</span></span> And then
you may return to bear record, yea, even altogether, or two by two, as
seemeth you good, it mattereth not unto me; only be faithful, and
declare glad tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, or among the
congregations of the wicked.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_62:6">62:6</span></span> Behold, I,
the Lord, have brought you together that the promise might be fulfilled,
that the faithful among you should be preserved and rejoice together in
the land of Missouri. I, the Lord, promise the faithful and cannot lie.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_62:7">62:7</span></span> I, the
Lord, am willing, if any among you desire to ride upon horses, or upon
mules, or in chariots, he shall receive this blessing, if he receive it
from the hand of the Lord, with a thankful heart in all things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_62:8">62:8</span></span> These
things remain with you to do according to judgment and the directions of
the Spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_62:9">62:9</span></span> Behold, the
kingdom is yours. And behold, and lo, I am with the faithful always.
Even so. Amen.
