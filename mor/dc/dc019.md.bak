### 19. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Martin Harris, Manchester, New York, March 1830. * History of the Church* 1:72-74.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:1">19:1</span></span> I am Alpha
and Omega, Christ the Lord; yea, even I am he, the beginning and the
end, the Redeemer of the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:2">19:2</span></span> I, having
accomplished and finished the will of him whose I am, even the Father,
concerning me—having done this that I might subdue all things unto
myself—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:3">19:3</span></span> Retaining
all power, even to the destroying of Satan and his works at the end of
the world, and the last great day of judgment, which I shall pass upon
the inhabitants thereof, judging every man according to his works and
the deeds which he hath done.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:4">19:4</span></span> And surely
every man must repent or suffer, for I, God, am endless.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:5">19:5</span></span> Wherefore,
I revoke not the judgments which I shall pass, but woes shall go forth,
weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth, yea, to those who are found on
my left hand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:6">19:6</span></span>
Nevertheless, it is not written that there shall be no end to this
torment, but it is written *endless* *torment.*

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:7">19:7</span></span> Again, it
is written *eternal damnation;* wherefore it is more express than other
scriptures, that it might work upon the hearts of the children of men,
altogether for my name's glory.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:8">19:8</span></span> Wherefore,
I will explain unto you this mystery, for it is meet unto you to know
even as mine apostles.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:9">19:9</span></span> I speak
unto you that are chosen in this thing, even as one, that you may enter
into my rest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:10">19:10</span></span> For,
behold, the mystery of godliness, how great is it! For, behold, I am
endless, and the punishment which is given from my hand is endless
punishment, for Endless is my name. Wherefore—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:11">19:11</span></span> Eternal
punishment is God's punishment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:12">19:12</span></span> Endless
punishment is God's punishment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:13">19:13</span></span>
Wherefore, I command you to repent, and keep the commandments which you
have received by the hand of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., in my name;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:14">19:14</span></span> And it is
by my almighty power that you have received them;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:15">19:15</span></span> Therefore
I command you to repent—repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth,
and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore—how sore
you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know
not.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:16">19:16</span></span> For
behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not
suffer if they would repent;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:17">19:17</span></span> But if
they would not repent they must suffer even as I;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:18">19:18</span></span> Which
suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble
because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and
spirit—and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:19">19:19</span></span>
Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my
preparations unto the children of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:20">19:20</span></span>
Wherefore, I command you again to repent, lest I humble you with my
almighty power; and that you confess your sins, lest you suffer these
punishments of which I have spoken, of which in the smallest, yea, even
in the least degree you have tasted at the time I withdrew my Spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:21">19:21</span></span> And I
command you that you preach naught but repentance, and show not these
things unto the world until it is wisdom in me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:22">19:22</span></span> For they
cannot bear meat now, but milk they must receive; wherefore, they must
not know these things, lest they perish.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:23">19:23</span></span> Learn of
me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you
shall have peace in me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:24">19:24</span></span> I am
Jesus Christ; I came by the will of the Father, and I do his will.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:25">19:25</span></span> And
again, I command thee that thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife; nor
seek thy neighbor's life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:26">19:26</span></span> And
again, I command thee that thou shalt not covet thine own property, but
impart it freely to the printing of the Book of Mormon, which contains
the truth and the word of God—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:27">19:27</span></span> Which is
my word to the Gentile, that soon it may go to the Jew, of whom the
Lamanites are a remnant, that they may believe the gospel, and look not
for a Messiah to come who has already come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:28">19:28</span></span> And
again, I command thee that thou shalt pray vocally as well as in thy
heart; yea, before the world as well as in secret, in public as well as
in private.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:29">19:29</span></span> And thou
shalt declare glad tidings, yea, publish it upon the mountains, and upon
every high place, and among every people that thou shalt be permitted to
see.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:30">19:30</span></span> And thou
shalt do it with all humility, trusting in me, reviling not against
revilers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:31">19:31</span></span> And of
tenets thou shalt not talk, but thou shalt declare repentance and faith
on the Savior, and remission of sins by baptism, and by fire, yea, even
the Holy Ghost.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:32">19:32</span></span> Behold,
this is a great and the last commandment which I shall give unto you
concerning this matter; for this shall suffice for thy daily walk, even
unto the end of thy life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:33">19:33</span></span> And
misery thou shalt receive if thou wilt slight these counsels, yea, even
the destruction of thyself and property.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:34">19:34</span></span> Impart a
portion of thy property, yea, even part of thy lands, and all save the
support of thy family.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:35">19:35</span></span> Pay the
debt thou hast contracted with the printer. Release thyself from
bondage.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:36">19:36</span></span> Leave thy
house and home, except when thou shalt desire to see thy family;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:37">19:37</span></span> And speak
freely to all; yea, preach, exhort, declare the truth, even with a loud
voice, with a sound of rejoicing, crying—Hosanna, hosanna, blessed be
the name of the Lord God!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:38">19:38</span></span> Pray
always, and I will pour out my Spirit upon you, and great shall be your
blessing—yea, even more than if you should obtain treasures of earth and
corruptibleness to the extent thereof.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:39">19:39</span></span> Behold,
canst thou read this without rejoicing and lifting up thy heart for
gladness?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:40">19:40</span></span> Or canst
thou run about longer as a blind guide?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_19:41">19:41</span></span> Or canst
thou be humble and meek, and conduct thyself wisely before me? Yea, come
unto me thy Savior. Amen.
