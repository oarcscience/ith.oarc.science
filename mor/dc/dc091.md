### 91. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Kirtland, Ohio, March 9, 1833. * History of the Church* 1:331-32.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_91:1">91:1</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord unto you concerning the Apocrypha—There are many
things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated
correctly;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_91:2">91:2</span></span> There are
many things contained therein that are not true, which are
interpolations by the hands of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_91:3">91:3</span></span> Verily, I
say unto you, that it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be
translated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_91:4">91:4</span></span> Therefore,
whoso readeth it, let him understand, for the Spirit manifesteth truth;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_91:5">91:5</span></span> And whoso
is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_91:6">91:6</span></span> And whoso
receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited. Therefore it is not
needful that it should be translated. Amen.
