### 43. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Kirtland, Ohio, February 1831.* History of the Church* 1:154-56.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:1">43:1</span></span> O hearken,
ye elders of my church, and give ear to the words which I shall speak
unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:2">43:2</span></span> For behold,
verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have received a commandment for
a law unto my church, through him whom I have appointed unto you to
receive commandments and revelations from my hand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:3">43:3</span></span> And this ye
shall know assuredly—that there is none other appointed unto you to
receive commandments and revelations until he be taken, if he abide in
me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:4">43:4</span></span> But verily,
verily, I say unto you, that none else shall be appointed unto this gift
except it be through him; for if it be taken from him he shall not have
power except to appoint another in his stead.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:5">43:5</span></span> And this
shall be a law unto you, that ye receive not the teachings of any that
shall come before you as revelations or commandments;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:6">43:6</span></span> And this I
give unto you that you may not be deceived, that you may know they are
not of me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:7">43:7</span></span> For verily
I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me shall come in at the gate
and be ordained as I have told you before, to teach those revelations
which you have received and shall receive through him whom I have
appointed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:8">43:8</span></span> And now,
behold, I give unto you a commandment, that when ye are assembled
together ye shall instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to
act and direct my church, how to act upon the points of my law and
commandments, which I have given.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:9">43:9</span></span> And thus ye
shall become instructed in the law of my church, and be sanctified by
that which ye have received, and ye shall bind yourselves to act in all
holiness before me—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:10">43:10</span></span> That
inasmuch as ye do this, glory shall be added to the kingdom which ye
have received. Inasmuch as ye do it not, it shall be taken, even that
which ye have received.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:11">43:11</span></span> Purge ye
out the iniquity which is among you; sanctify yourselves before me;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:12">43:12</span></span> And if ye
desire the glories of the kingdom, appoint ye my servant Joseph Smith,
Jun., and uphold him before me by the prayer of faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:13">43:13</span></span> And
again, I say unto you, that if ye desire the mysteries of the kingdom,
provide for him food and raiment, and whatsoever thing he needeth to
accomplish the work wherewith I have commanded him;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:14">43:14</span></span> And if ye
do it not he shall remain unto them that have received him, that I may
reserve unto myself a pure people before me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:15">43:15</span></span> Again I
say, hearken ye elders of my church, whom I have appointed: Ye are not
sent forth to be taught, but to teach the children of men the things
which I have put into your hands by the power of my Spirit;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:16">43:16</span></span> And ye
are to be taught from on high. Sanctify yourselves and ye shall be
endowed with power, that ye may give even as I have spoken.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:17">43:17</span></span> Hearken
ye, for, behold, the great day of the Lord is nigh at hand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:18">43:18</span></span> For the
day cometh that the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven; the
heavens shall shake and the earth shall tremble, and the trump of God
shall sound both long and loud, and shall say to the sleeping nations:
Ye saints arise and live; ye sinners stay and sleep until I shall call
again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:19">43:19</span></span> Wherefore
gird up your loins lest ye be found among the wicked.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:20">43:20</span></span> Lift up
your voices and spare not. Call upon the nations to repent, both old and
young, both bond and free, saying: Prepare yourselves for the great day
of the Lord;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:21">43:21</span></span> For if I,
who am a man, do lift up my voice and call upon you to repent, and ye
hate me, what will ye say when the day cometh when the thunders shall
utter their voices from the ends of the earth, speaking to the ears of
all that live, saying—Repent, and prepare for the great day of the Lord?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:22">43:22</span></span> Yea, and
again, when the lightnings shall streak forth from the east unto the
west, and shall utter forth their voices unto all that live, and make
the ears of all tingle that hear, saying these words—Repent ye, for the
great day of the Lord is come?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:23">43:23</span></span> And
again, the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven, saying: Hearken, O
ye nations of the earth, and hear the words of that God who made you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:24">43:24</span></span> O, ye
nations of the earth, how often would I have gathered you together as a
hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:25">43:25</span></span> How oft
have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants, and by the
ministering of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice of
thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of
tempests, and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by
the voice of famines and pestilences of every kind, and by the great
sound of a trump, and by the voice of judgment, and by the voice of
mercy all the day long, and by the voice of glory and honor and the
riches of eternal life, and would have saved you with an everlasting
salvation, but ye would not!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:26">43:26</span></span> Behold,
the day has come, when the cup of the wrath of mine indignation is full.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:27">43:27</span></span> Behold,
verily I say unto you, that these are the words of the Lord your God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:28">43:28</span></span>
Wherefore, labor ye, labor ye in my vineyard for the last time—for the
last time call upon the inhabitants of the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:29">43:29</span></span> For in
mine own due time will I come upon the earth in judgment, and my people
shall be redeemed and shall reign with me on earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:30">43:30</span></span> For the
great Millennium, of which I have spoken by the mouth of my servants,
shall come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:31">43:31</span></span> For Satan
shall be bound, and when he is loosed again he shall only reign for a
little season, and then cometh the end of the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:32">43:32</span></span> And he
that liveth in righteousness shall be changed in the twinkling of an
eye, and the earth shall pass away so as by fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:33">43:33</span></span> And the
wicked shall go away into unquenchable fire, and their end no man
knoweth on earth, nor ever shall know, until they come before me in
judgment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:34">43:34</span></span> Hearken
ye to these words. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world.
Treasure these things up in your hearts, and let the solemnities of
eternity rest upon your minds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43:35">43:35</span></span> Be sober.
Keep all my commandments. Even so. Amen.
