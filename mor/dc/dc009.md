### 9. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Oliver Cowdery, Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829. * History of the Church* 1:37-38.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:1">9:1</span></span> Behold, I say
unto you, my son, that because you did not translate according to that
which you desired of me, and did commence again to write for my servant,
Joseph Smith, Jun., even so I would that ye should continue until you
have finished this record, which I have entrusted unto him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:2">9:2</span></span> And then,
behold, other records have I, that I will give unto you power that you
may assist to translate.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:3">9:3</span></span> Be patient,
my son, for it is wisdom in me, and it is not expedient that you should
translate at this present time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:4">9:4</span></span> Behold, the
work which you are called to do is to write for my servant Joseph.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:5">9:5</span></span> And, behold,
it is because that you did not continue as you commenced, when you began
to translate, that I have taken away this privilege from you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:6">9:6</span></span> Do not
murmur, my son, for it is wisdom in me that I have dealt with you after
this manner.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:7">9:7</span></span> Behold, you
have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you,
when you took no thought save it was to ask me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:8">9:8</span></span> But, behold,
I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must
ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom
shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:9">9:9</span></span> But if it be
not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor
of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong;
therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you
from me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:10">9:10</span></span> Now, if you
had known this you could have translated; nevertheless, it is not
expedient that you should translate now.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:11">9:11</span></span> Behold, it
was expedient when you commenced; but you feared, and the time is past,
and it is not expedient now;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:12">9:12</span></span> For, do you
not behold that I have given unto my servant Joseph sufficient strength,
whereby it is made up? And neither of you have I condemned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:13">9:13</span></span> Do this
thing which I have commanded you, and you shall prosper. Be faithful,
and yield to no temptation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_9:14">9:14</span></span> Stand fast
in the work wherewith I have called you, and a hair of your head shall
not be lost, and you shall be lifted up at the last day. Amen.
