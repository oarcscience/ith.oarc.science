### 33. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Ezra Thayre and Northrop Sweet, Fayette, New York, October 1830. * History of the Church* 1:126-27.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:1">33:1</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you, my servants Ezra and Northrop, open ye your ears and
hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, whose word is quick and
powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of the
joints and marrow, soul and spirit; and is a discerner of the thoughts
and intents of the heart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:2">33:2</span></span> For verily,
verily, I say unto you that ye are called to lift up your voices as with
the sound of a trump, to declare my gospel unto a crooked and perverse
generation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:3">33:3</span></span> For behold,
the field is white already to harvest; and it is the eleventh hour, and
the last time that I shall call laborers into my vineyard.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:4">33:4</span></span> And my
vineyard has become corrupted every whit; and there is none which doeth
good save it be a few; and they err in many instances because of
priestcrafts, all having corrupt minds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:5">33:5</span></span> And verily,
verily, I say unto you, that this church have I established and called
forth out of the wilderness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:6">33:6</span></span> And even so
will I gather mine elect from the four quarters of the earth, even as
many as will believe in me, and hearken unto my voice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:7">33:7</span></span> Yea,
verily, verily, I say unto you, that the field is white already to
harvest; wherefore, thrust in your sickles, and reap with all your
might, mind, and strength.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:8">33:8</span></span> Open your
mouths and they shall be filled, and you shall become even as Nephi of
old, who journeyed from Jerusalem in the wilderness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:9">33:9</span></span> Yea, open
your mouths and spare not, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your
backs, for lo, I am with you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:10">33:10</span></span> Yea, open
your mouths and they shall be filled, saying: Repent, repent, and
prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for the
kingdom of heaven is at hand;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:11">33:11</span></span> Yea,
repent and be baptized, every one of you, for a remission of your sins;
yea, be baptized even by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and
of the Holy Ghost.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:12">33:12</span></span> Behold,
verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and remember that
they shall have faith in me or they can in nowise be saved;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:13">33:13</span></span> And upon
this rock I will build my church; yea, upon this rock ye are built, and
if ye continue, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:14">33:14</span></span> And ye
shall remember the church articles and covenants to keep them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:15">33:15</span></span> And whoso
having faith you shall confirm in my church, by the laying on of the
hands, and I will bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost upon them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:16">33:16</span></span> And the
Book of Mormon and the holy scriptures are given of me for your
instruction; and the power of my Spirit quickeneth all things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:17">33:17</span></span>
Wherefore, be faithful, praying always, having your lamps trimmed and
burning, and oil with you, that you may be ready at the coming of the
Bridegroom—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33:18">33:18</span></span> For
behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that I come quickly. Even so.
Amen.
