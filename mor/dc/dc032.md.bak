### 32. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Parley P. Pratt and Ziba Peterson, October 1830. * History of the Church* 1:118-20.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_32:1">32:1</span></span> And now
concerning my servant Parley P. Pratt, behold, I say unto him that as I
live I will that he shall declare my gospel and learn of me, and be meek
and lowly of heart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_32:2">32:2</span></span> And that
which I have appointed unto him is that he shall go with my servants,
Oliver Cowdery and Peter Whitmer, Jun., into the wilderness among the
Lamanites.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_32:3">32:3</span></span> And Ziba
Peterson also shall go with them; and I myself will go with them and be
in their midst; and I am their advocate with the Father, and nothing
shall prevail against them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_32:4">32:4</span></span> And they
shall give heed to that which is written, and pretend to no other
revelation; and they shall pray always that I may unfold the same to
their understanding.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_32:5">32:5</span></span> And they
shall give heed unto these words and trifle not, and I will bless them.
Amen.
