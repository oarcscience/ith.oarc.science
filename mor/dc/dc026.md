### 26. Revelation to Joseph Smith, Oliver Cowdery, and John Whitmer, Harmony, Pennsylvania, July 1830. See * History of the Church* 1:104.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_26:1">26:1</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you that you shall let your time be devoted to the studying of
the scriptures, and to preaching, and to confirming the church at
Colesville, and to performing your labors on the land, such as is
required, until after you shall go to the west to hold the next
conference; and then it shall be made known what you shall do.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_26:2">26:2</span></span> And all
things shall be done by common consent in the church, by much prayer and
faith, for all things you shall receive by faith. Amen.
