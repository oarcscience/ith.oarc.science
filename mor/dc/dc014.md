### 14. Revelation through Joseph Smith to David Whitmer, Fayette, New York, June 1829. * History of the Church* 1:48-50.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_14:1">14:1</span></span> A great and
marvelous work is about to come forth unto the children of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_14:2">14:2</span></span> Behold, I
am God; give heed to my word, which is quick and powerful, sharper than
a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and marrow;
therefore give heed unto my word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_14:3">14:3</span></span> Behold, the
field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap let
him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts,
that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the
kingdom of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_14:4">14:4</span></span> Yea,
whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_14:5">14:5</span></span> Therefore,
if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will knock it shall be
opened unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_14:6">14:6</span></span> Seek to
bring forth and establish my Zion. Keep my commandments in all things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_14:7">14:7</span></span> And, if you
keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life,
which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_14:8">14:8</span></span> And it
shall come to pass, that if you shall ask the Father in my name, in
faith believing, you shall receive the Holy Ghost, which giveth
utterance, that you may stand as a witness of the things of which you
shall both hear and see, and also that you may declare repentance unto
this generation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_14:9">14:9</span></span> Behold, I
am Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, who created the heavens and
the earth, a light which cannot be hid in darkness;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_14:10">14:10</span></span>
Wherefore, I must bring forth the fulness of my gospel from the Gentiles
unto the house of Israel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_14:11">14:11</span></span> And
behold, thou art David, and thou art called to assist; which thing if ye
do, and are faithful, ye shall be blessed both spiritually and
temporally, and great shall be your reward. Amen.
