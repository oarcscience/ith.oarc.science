*Doctrine and Covenants of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day
Saints*, at Intangible Textual Heritage

### 136. The word and will of the Lord given through President Brigham Young, Winter Quarters, Omaha Nation, West Bank of the Missouri River near Council Bluffs, Iowa. *Journal History of the Church*, January 14, 1847.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:1">136:1</span></span> The Word
and Will of the Lord concerning the Camp of Israel in their journeyings
to the West:

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:2">136:2</span></span> Let all
the people of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and those
who journey with them, be organized into companies, with a covenant and
promise to keep all the commandments and statutes of the Lord our God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:3">136:3</span></span> Let the
companies be organized with captains of hundreds, captains of fifties,
and captains of tens, with a president and his two counselors at their
head, under the direction of the Twelve Apostles.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:4">136:4</span></span> And this
shall be our covenant—that we will walk in all the ordinances of the
Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:5">136:5</span></span> Let each
company provide themselves with all the teams, wagons, provisions,
clothing, and other necessaries for the journey, that they can.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:6">136:6</span></span> When the
companies are organized let them go to with their might, to prepare for
those who are to tarry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:7">136:7</span></span> Let each
company, with their captains and presidents, decide how many can go next
spring; then choose out a sufficient number of able-bodied and expert
men, to take teams, seeds, and farming utensils, to go as pioneers to
prepare for putting in spring crops.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:8">136:8</span></span> Let each
company bear an equal proportion, according to the dividend of their
property, in taking the poor, the widows, the fatherless, and the
families of those who have gone into the army, that the cries of the
widow and the fatherless come not up into the ears of the Lord against
this people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:9">136:9</span></span> Let each
company prepare houses, and fields for raising grain, for those who are
to remain behind this season; and this is the will of the Lord
concerning his people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:10">136:10</span></span> Let
every man use all his influence and property to remove this people to
the place where the Lord shall locate a stake of Zion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:11">136:11</span></span> And if
ye do this with a pure heart, in all faithfulness, ye shall be blessed;
you shall be blessed in your flocks, and in your herds, and in your
fields, and in your houses, and in your families.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:12">136:12</span></span> Let my
servants Ezra T. Benson and Erastus Snow organize a company.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:13">136:13</span></span> And let
my servants Orson Pratt and Wilford Woodruff organize a company.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:14">136:14</span></span> Also,
let my servants Amasa Lyman and George A. Smith organize a company.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:15">136:15</span></span> And
appoint presidents, and captains of hundreds, and of fifties, and of
tens.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:16">136:16</span></span> And let
my servants that have been appointed go and teach this, my will, to the
saints, that they may be ready to go to a land of peace.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:17">136:17</span></span> Go thy
way and do as I have told you, and fear not thine enemies; for they
shall not have power to stop my work.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:18">136:18</span></span> Zion
shall be redeemed in mine own due time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:19">136:19</span></span> And if
any man shall seek to build up himself, and seeketh not my counsel, he
shall have no power, and his folly shall be made manifest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:20">136:20</span></span> Seek
ye; and keep all your pledges one with another; and covet not that which
is thy brother's.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:21">136:21</span></span> Keep
yourselves from evil to take the name of the Lord in vain, for I am the
Lord your God, even the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of
Isaac and of Jacob.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:22">136:22</span></span> I am he
who led the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; and my arm is
stretched out in the last days, to save my people Israel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:23">136:23</span></span> Cease
to contend one with another; cease to speak evil one of another.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:24">136:24</span></span> Cease
drunkenness; and let your words tend to edifying one another.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:25">136:25</span></span> If thou
borrowest of thy neighbor, thou shalt restore that which thou hast
borrowed; and if thou canst not repay then go straightway and tell thy
neighbor, lest he condemn thee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:26">136:26</span></span> If thou
shalt find that which thy neighbor has lost, thou shalt make diligent
search till thou shalt deliver it to him again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:27">136:27</span></span> Thou
shalt be diligent in preserving what thou hast, that thou mayest be a
wise steward; for it is the free gift of the Lord thy God, and thou art
his steward.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:28">136:28</span></span> If thou
art merry, praise the Lord with singing, with music, with dancing, and
with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:29">136:29</span></span> If thou
art sorrowful, call on the Lord thy God with supplication, that your
souls may be joyful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:30">136:30</span></span> Fear
not thine enemies, for they are in mine hands and I will do my pleasure
with them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:31">136:31</span></span> My
people must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to receive
the glory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion; and he that will
not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:32">136:32</span></span> Let him
that is ignorant learn wisdom by humbling himself and calling upon the
Lord his God, that his eyes may be opened that he may see, and his ears
opened that he may hear;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:33">136:33</span></span> For my
Spirit is sent forth into the world to enlighten the humble and
contrite, and to the condemnation of the ungodly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:34">136:34</span></span> Thy
brethren have rejected you and your testimony, even the nation that has
driven you out;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:35">136:35</span></span> And now
cometh the day of their calamity, even the days of sorrow, like a woman
that is taken in travail; and their sorrow shall be great unless they
speedily repent, yea, very speedily.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:36">136:36</span></span> For
they killed the prophets, and them that were sent unto them; and they
have shed innocent blood, which crieth from the ground against them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:37">136:37</span></span>
Therefore, marvel not at these things, for ye are not yet pure; ye can
not yet bear my glory; but ye shall behold it if ye are faithful in
keeping all my words that I have given you, from the days of Adam to
Abraham, from Abraham to Moses, from Moses to Jesus and his apostles,
and from Jesus and his apostles to Joseph Smith, whom I did call upon by
mine angels, my ministering servants, and by mine own voice out of the
heavens, to bring forth my work;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:38">136:38</span></span> Which
foundation he did lay, and was faithful; and I took him to myself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:39">136:39</span></span> Many
have marveled because of his death; but it was needful that he should
seal his testimony with his blood, that he might be honored and the
wicked might be condemned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:40">136:40</span></span> Have I
not delivered you from your enemies, only in that I have left a witness
of my name?

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:41">136:41</span></span> Now,
therefore, hearken, O ye people of my church; and ye elders listen
together; you have received my kingdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136:42">136:42</span></span> Be
diligent in keeping all my commandments, lest judgments come upon you,
and your faith fail you, and your enemies triumph over you. So no more
at present. Amen and Amen.
