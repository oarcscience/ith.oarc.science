### 23. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Manchester, New York, April 1830, to Oliver Cowdery, Hyrum Smith, Samuel H. Smith, Joseph Smith, Sr., and Joseph Knight, Sr. * History of the Church* 1:80.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_23:1">23:1</span></span> Behold, I
speak unto you, Oliver, a few words. Behold, thou art blessed, and art
under no condemnation. But beware of pride, lest thou shouldst enter
into temptation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_23:2">23:2</span></span> Make known
thy calling unto the church, and also before the world, and thy heart
shall be opened to preach the truth from henceforth and forever. Amen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_23:3">23:3</span></span> Behold, I
speak unto you, Hyrum, a few words; for thou also art under no
condemnation, and thy heart is opened, and thy tongue loosed; and thy
calling is to exhortation, and to strengthen the church continually.
Wherefore thy duty is unto the church forever, and this because of thy
family. Amen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_23:4">23:4</span></span> Behold, I
speak a few words unto you, Samuel; for thou also art under no
condemnation, and thy calling is to exhortation, and to strengthen the
church; and thou art not as yet called to preach before the world. Amen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_23:5">23:5</span></span> Behold, I
speak a few words unto you, Joseph; for thou also art under no
condemnation, and thy calling also is to exhortation, and to strengthen
the church; and this is thy duty from henceforth and forever. Amen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_23:6">23:6</span></span> Behold, I
manifest unto you, Joseph Knight, by these words, that you must take up
your cross, in the which you must pray vocally before the world as well
as in secret, and in your family, and among your friends, and in all
places.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_23:7">23:7</span></span> And,
behold, it is your duty to unite with the true church, and give your
language to exhortation continually, that you may receive the reward of
the laborer. Amen.
