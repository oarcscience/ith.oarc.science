### 126. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Nauvoo, Illinois, July 9, 1841. * History of the Church* 4:382.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_126:1">126:1</span></span> Dear and
well-beloved brother, Brigham Young, verily thus saith the Lord unto
you: My servant Brigham, it is no more required at your hand to leave
your family as in times past, for your offering is acceptable to me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_126:2">126:2</span></span> I have
seen your labor and toil in journeyings for my name.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_126:3">126:3</span></span> I
therefore command you to send my word abroad, and take especial care of
your family from this time, henceforth and forever. Amen.
