### 21. Revelation to Joseph Smith, Fayette, New York, April 6, 1830. * History of the Church* 1:74-79.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_21:1">21:1</span></span> Behold,
there shall be a record kept among you; and in it thou shalt be called a
seer, a translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of
the church through the will of God the Father, and the grace of your
Lord Jesus Christ,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_21:2">21:2</span></span> Being
inspired of the Holy Ghost to lay the foundation thereof, and to build
it up unto the most holy faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_21:3">21:3</span></span> Which
church was organized and established in the year of your Lord eighteen
hundred and thirty, in the fourth month, and on the sixth day of the
month which is called April.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_21:4">21:4</span></span> Wherefore,
meaning the church, thou shalt give heed unto all his words and
commandments which he shall give unto you as he receiveth them, walking
in all holiness before me;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_21:5">21:5</span></span> For his
word ye shall receive, as if from mine own mouth, in all patience and
faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_21:6">21:6</span></span> For by
doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea,
and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you,
and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_21:7">21:7</span></span> For thus
saith the Lord God: Him have I inspired to move the cause of Zion in
mighty power for good, and his diligence I know, and his prayers I have
heard.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_21:8">21:8</span></span> Yea, his
weeping for Zion I have seen, and I will cause that he shall mourn for
her no longer; for his days of rejoicing are come unto the remission of
his sins, and the manifestations of my blessings upon his works.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_21:9">21:9</span></span> For,
behold, I will bless all those who labor in my vineyard with a mighty
blessing, and they shall believe on his words, which are given him
through me by the Comforter, which manifesteth that Jesus was crucified
by sinful men for the sins of the world, yea, for the remission of sins
unto the contrite heart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_21:10">21:10</span></span> Wherefore
it behooveth me that he should be ordained by you, Oliver Cowdery mine
apostle;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_21:11">21:11</span></span> This
being an ordinance unto you, that you are an elder under his hand, he
being the first unto you, that you might be an elder unto this church of
Christ, bearing my name—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_21:12">21:12</span></span> And the
first preacher of this church unto the church, and before the world,
yea, before the Gentiles; yea, and thus saith the Lord God, lo, lo! to
the Jews also. Amen.
