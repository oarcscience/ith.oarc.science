### 60. Revelation through Joseph Smith, in Jackson County, Missouri, August 8, 1831. * History of the Church* 1:201-2.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:1">60:1</span></span> Behold,
thus saith the Lord unto the elders of his church, who are to return
speedily to the land from whence they came: Behold, it pleaseth me, that
you have come up hither;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:2">60:2</span></span> But with
some I am not well pleased, for they will not open their mouths, but
they hide the talent which I have given unto them, because of the fear
of man. Wo unto such, for mine anger is kindled against them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:3">60:3</span></span> And it
shall come to pass, if they are not more faithful unto me, it shall be
taken away, even that which they have.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:4">60:4</span></span> For I, the
Lord, rule in the heavens above, and among the armies of the earth; and
in the day when I shall make up my jewels, all men shall know what it is
that bespeaketh the power of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:5">60:5</span></span> But,
verily, I will speak unto you concerning your journey unto the land from
whence you came. Let there be a craft made, or bought, as seemeth you
good, it mattereth not unto me, and take your journey speedily for the
place which is called St. Louis.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:6">60:6</span></span> And from
thence let my servants, Sidney Rigdon, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver
Cowdery, take their journey for Cincinnati;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:7">60:7</span></span> And in this
place let them lift up their voice and declare my word with loud voices,
without wrath or doubting, lifting up holy hands upon them. For I am
able to make you holy, and your sins are forgiven you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:8">60:8</span></span> And let the
residue take their journey from St. Louis, two by two, and preach the
word, not in haste, among the congregations of the wicked, until they
return to the churches from whence they came.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:9">60:9</span></span> And all
this for the good of the churches; for this intent have I sent them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:10">60:10</span></span> And let
my servant Edward Partridge impart of the money which I have given him,
a portion unto mine elders who are commanded to return;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:11">60:11</span></span> And he
that is able, let him return it by the way of the agent; and he that is
not, of him it is not required.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:12">60:12</span></span> And now I
speak of the residue who are to come unto this land.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:13">60:13</span></span> Behold,
they have been sent to preach my gospel among the congregations of the
wicked; wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, thus: Thou shalt not
idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not
be known.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:14">60:14</span></span> And after
thou hast come up unto the land of Zion, and hast proclaimed my word,
thou shalt speedily return, proclaiming my word among the congregations
of the wicked, not in haste, neither in wrath nor with strife.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:15">60:15</span></span> And shake
off the dust of thy feet against those who receive thee not, not in
their presence, lest thou provoke them, but in secret; and wash thy
feet, as a testimony against them in the day of judgment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:16">60:16</span></span> Behold,
this is sufficient for you, and the will of him who hath sent you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_60:17">60:17</span></span> And by
the mouth of my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., it shall be made known
concerning Sidney Rigdon and Oliver Cowdery. The residue hereafter. Even
so. Amen.
