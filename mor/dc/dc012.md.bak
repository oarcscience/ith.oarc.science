### 12. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Joseph Knight, Sr., Harmony, Pennsylvania, May 1829. * History of the Church* 1:47-48.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_12:1">12:1</span></span> A great and
marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_12:2">12:2</span></span> Behold, I
am God; give heed to my word, which is quick and powerful, sharper than
a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and marrow;
therefore, give heed unto my word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_12:3">12:3</span></span> Behold, the
field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap let
him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts,
that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the
kingdom of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_12:4">12:4</span></span> Yea,
whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_12:5">12:5</span></span> Therefore,
if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will knock it shall be
opened unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_12:6">12:6</span></span> Now, as you
have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my commandments, and seek to
bring forth and establish the cause of Zion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_12:7">12:7</span></span> Behold, I
speak unto you, and also to all those who have desires to bring forth
and establish this work;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_12:8">12:8</span></span> And no one
can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love,
having faith, hope, and charity, being temperate in all things,
whatsoever shall be entrusted to his care.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_12:9">12:9</span></span> Behold, I
am the light and the life of the world, that speak these words,
therefore give heed with your might, and then you are called. Amen.
