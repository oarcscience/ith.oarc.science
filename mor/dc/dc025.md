### 25. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Harmony, Pennsylvania, July 1830. See * History of the Church* 1:103-4.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:1">25:1</span></span> Hearken
unto the voice of the Lord your God, while I speak unto you, Emma Smith,
my daughter; for verily I say unto you, all those who receive my gospel
are sons and daughters in my kingdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:2">25:2</span></span> A
revelation I give unto you concerning my will; and if thou art faithful
and walk in the paths of virtue before me, I will preserve thy life, and
thou shalt receive an inheritance in Zion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:3">25:3</span></span> Behold, thy
sins are forgiven thee, and thou art an elect lady, whom I have called.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:4">25:4</span></span> Murmur not
because of the things which thou hast not seen, for they are withheld
from thee and from the world, which is wisdom in me in a time to come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:5">25:5</span></span> And the
office of thy calling shall be for a comfort unto my servant, Joseph
Smith, Jun., thy husband, in his afflictions, with consoling words, in
the spirit of meekness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:6">25:6</span></span> And thou
shalt go with him at the time of his going, and be unto him for a
scribe, while there is no one to be a scribe for him, that I may send my
servant, Oliver Cowdery, whithersoever I will.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:7">25:7</span></span> And thou
shalt be ordained under his hand to expound scriptures, and to exhort
the church, according as it shall be given thee by my Spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:8">25:8</span></span> For he
shall lay his hands upon thee, and thou shalt receive the Holy Ghost,
and thy time shall be given to writing, and to learning much.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:9">25:9</span></span> And thou
needest not fear, for thy husband shall support thee in the church; for
unto them is his calling, that all things might be revealed unto them,
whatsoever I will, according to their faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:10">25:10</span></span> And
verily I say unto thee that thou shalt lay aside the things of this
world, and seek for the things of a better.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:11">25:11</span></span> And it
shall be given thee, also, to make a selection of sacred hymns, as it
shall be given thee, which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:12">25:12</span></span> For my
soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous
is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their
heads.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:13">25:13</span></span>
Wherefore, lift up thy heart and rejoice, and cleave unto the covenants
which thou hast made.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:14">25:14</span></span> Continue
in the spirit of meekness, and beware of pride. Let thy soul delight in
thy husband, and the glory which shall come upon him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:15">25:15</span></span> Keep my
commandments continually, and a crown of righteousness thou shalt
receive. And except thou do this, where I am you cannot come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_25:16">25:16</span></span> And
verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my voice unto all. Amen.
