### 8. Revelation through Joseph Smith to Oliver Cowdery, Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829. * History of the Church* 1:36-37.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8:1">8:1</span></span> Oliver
Cowdery, verily, verily, I say unto you, that assuredly as the Lord
liveth, who is your God and your Redeemer, even so surely shall you
receive a knowledge of whatsoever things you shall ask in faith, with an
honest heart, believing that you shall receive a knowledge concerning
the engravings of old records, which are ancient, which contain those
parts of my scripture of which has been spoken by the manifestation of
my Spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8:2">8:2</span></span> Yea, behold,
I will tell you in your mind and in your heart, by the Holy Ghost, which
shall come upon you and which shall dwell in your heart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8:3">8:3</span></span> Now, behold,
this is the spirit of revelation; behold, this is the spirit by which
Moses brought the children of Israel through the Red Sea on dry ground.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8:4">8:4</span></span> Therefore
this is thy gift; apply unto it, and blessed art thou, for it shall
deliver you out of the hands of your enemies, when, if it were not so,
they would slay you and bring your soul to destruction.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8:5">8:5</span></span> Oh, remember
these words, and keep my commandments. Remember, this is your gift.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8:6">8:6</span></span> Now this is
not all thy gift; for you have another gift, which is the gift of Aaron;
behold, it has told you many things;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8:7">8:7</span></span> Behold, there
is no other power, save the power of God, that can cause this gift of
Aaron to be with you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8:8">8:8</span></span> Therefore,
doubt not, for it is the gift of God; and you shall hold it in your
hands, and do marvelous works; and no power shall be able to take it
away out of your hands, for it is the work of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8:9">8:9</span></span> And,
therefore, whatsoever you shall ask me to tell you by that means, that
will I grant unto you, and you shall have knowledge concerning it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8:10">8:10</span></span> Remember
that without faith you can do nothing; therefore ask in faith. Trifle
not with these things; do not ask for that which you ought not.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8:11">8:11</span></span> Ask that
you may know the mysteries of God, and that you may translate and
receive knowledge from all those ancient records which have been hid up,
that are sacred; and according to your faith shall it be done unto you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_8:12">8:12</span></span> Behold, it
is I that have spoken it; and I am the same that spake unto you from the
beginning. Amen.
