### 68. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Hiram, Ohio, November 1831. * History of the Church* 1:227-29.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:1">68:1</span></span> My servant,
Orson Hyde, was called by his ordination to proclaim the everlasting
gospel, by the Spirit of the living God, from people to people, and from
land to land, in the congregations of the wicked, in their synagogues,
reasoning with and expounding all scriptures unto them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:2">68:2</span></span> And,
behold, and lo, this is an ensample unto all those who were ordained
unto this priesthood, whose mission is appointed unto them to go forth—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:3">68:3</span></span> And this is
the ensample unto them, that they shall speak as they are moved upon by
the Holy Ghost.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:4">68:4</span></span> And
whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be
scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord,
shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the
power of God unto salvation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:5">68:5</span></span> Behold,
this is the promise of the Lord unto you, O ye my servants.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:6">68:6</span></span> Wherefore,
be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will
stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I
am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to
come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:7">68:7</span></span> This is the
word of the Lord unto you, my servant Orson Hyde, and also unto my
servant Luke Johnson, and unto my servant Lyman Johnson, and unto my
servant William E. McLellin, and unto all the faithful elders of my
church—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:8">68:8</span></span> Go ye into
all the world, preach the gospel to every creature, acting in the
authority which I have given you, baptizing in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:9">68:9</span></span> And he that
believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not
shall be damned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:10">68:10</span></span> And he
that believeth shall be blest with signs following, even as it is
written.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:11">68:11</span></span> And unto
you it shall be given to know the signs of the times, and the signs of
the coming of the Son of Man;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:12">68:12</span></span> And of as
many as the Father shall bear record, to you shall be given power to
seal them up unto eternal life. Amen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:13">68:13</span></span> And now,
concerning the items in addition to the covenants and commandments, they
are these—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:14">68:14</span></span> There
remain hereafter, in the due time of the Lord, other bishops to be set
apart unto the church, to minister even according to the first;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:15">68:15</span></span> Wherefore
they shall be high priests who are worthy, and they shall be appointed
by the First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood, except they be
literal descendants of Aaron.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:16">68:16</span></span> And if
they be literal descendants of Aaron they have a legal right to the
bishopric, if they are the firstborn among the sons of Aaron;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:17">68:17</span></span> For the
firstborn holds the right of the presidency over this priesthood, and
the keys or authority of the same.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:18">68:18</span></span> No man
has a legal right to this office, to hold the keys of this priesthood,
except he be a literal descendant and the firstborn of Aaron.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:19">68:19</span></span> But, as a
high priest of the Melchizedek Priesthood has authority to officiate in
all the lesser offices he may officiate in the office of bishop when no
literal descendant of Aaron can be found, provided he is called and set
apart and ordained unto this power, under the hands of the First
Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:20">68:20</span></span> And a
literal descendant of Aaron, also, must be designated by this
Presidency, and found worthy, and anointed, and ordained under the hands
of this Presidency, otherwise they are not legally authorized to
officiate in their priesthood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:21">68:21</span></span> But, by
virtue of the decree concerning their right of the priesthood descending
from father to son, they may claim their anointing if at any time they
can prove their lineage, or do ascertain it by revelation from the Lord
under the hands of the above named Presidency.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:22">68:22</span></span> And
again, no bishop or high priest who shall be set apart for this ministry
shall be tried or condemned for any crime, save it be before the First
Presidency of the church;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:23">68:23</span></span> And
inasmuch as he is found guilty before this Presidency, by testimony that
cannot be impeached, he shall be condemned;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:24">68:24</span></span> And if he
repent he shall be forgiven, according to the covenants and commandments
of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:25">68:25</span></span> And
again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion, or in any of her
stakes which are organized, that teach them not to understand the
doctrine of repentance, faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and
of baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands,
when eight years old, the sin be upon the heads of the parents.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:26">68:26</span></span> For this
shall be a law unto the inhabitants of Zion, or in any of her stakes
which are organized.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:27">68:27</span></span> And their
children shall be baptized for the remission of their sins when eight
years old, and receive the laying on of the hands.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:28">68:28</span></span> And they
shall also teach their children to pray, and to walk uprightly before
the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:29">68:29</span></span> And the
inhabitants of Zion shall also observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:30">68:30</span></span> And the
inhabitants of Zion also shall remember their labors, inasmuch as they
are appointed to labor, in all faithfulness; for the idler shall be had
in remembrance before the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:31">68:31</span></span> Now, I,
the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there
are idlers among them; and their children are also growing up in
wickedness; they also seek not earnestly the riches of eternity, but
their eyes are full of greediness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:32">68:32</span></span> These
things ought not to be, and must be done away from among them;
wherefore, let my servant Oliver Cowdery carry these sayings unto the
land of Zion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:33">68:33</span></span> And a
commandment I give unto them—that he that observeth not his prayers
before the Lord in the season thereof, let him be had in remembrance
before the judge of my people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:34">68:34</span></span> These
sayings are true and faithful; wherefore, transgress them not, neither
take therefrom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_68:35">68:35</span></span> Behold, I
am Alpha and Omega, and I come quickly. Amen.
