### 93. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Kirtland, Ohio, May 6, 1833. * History of the Church* 1:343-46.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:1">93:1</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh
his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my
voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I
am;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:2">93:2</span></span> And that I
am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:3">93:3</span></span> And that I
am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:4">93:4</span></span> The Father
because he gave me of his fulness, and the Son because I was in the
world and made flesh my tabernacle, and dwelt among the sons of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:5">93:5</span></span> I was in
the world and received of my Father, and the works of him were plainly
manifest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:6">93:6</span></span> And John
saw and bore record of the fulness of my glory, and the fulness of
John's record is hereafter to be revealed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:7">93:7</span></span> And he bore
record, saying: I saw his glory, that he was in the beginning, before
the world was;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:8">93:8</span></span> Therefore,
in the beginning the Word was, for he was the Word, even the messenger
of salvation—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:9">93:9</span></span> The light
and the Redeemer of the world; the Spirit of truth, who came into the
world, because the world was made by him, and in him was the life of men
and the light of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:10">93:10</span></span> The
worlds were made by him; men were made by him; all things were made by
him, and through him, and of him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:11">93:11</span></span> And I,
John, bear record that I beheld his glory, as the glory of the Only
Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, even the Spirit of
truth, which came and dwelt in the flesh, and dwelt among us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:12">93:12</span></span> And I,
John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but received
grace for grace;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:13">93:13</span></span> And he
received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace,
until he received a fulness;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:14">93:14</span></span> And thus
he was called the Son of God, because he received not of the fulness at
the first.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:15">93:15</span></span> And I,
John, bear record, and lo, the heavens were opened, and the Holy Ghost
descended upon him in the form of a dove, and sat upon him, and there
came a voice out of heaven saying: This is my beloved Son.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:16">93:16</span></span> And I,
John, bear record that he received a fulness of the glory of the Father;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:17">93:17</span></span> And he
received all power, both in heaven and on earth, and the glory of the
Father was with him, for he dwelt in him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:18">93:18</span></span> And it
shall come to pass, that if you are faithful you shall receive the
fulness of the record of John.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:19">93:19</span></span> I give
unto you these sayings that you may understand and know how to worship,
and know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name,
and in due time receive of his fulness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:20">93:20</span></span> For if
you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, and be
glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you
shall receive grace for grace.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:21">93:21</span></span> And now,
verily I say unto you, I was in the beginning with the Father, and am
the Firstborn;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:22">93:22</span></span> And all
those who are begotten through me are partakers of the glory of the
same, and are the church of the Firstborn.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:23">93:23</span></span> Ye were
also in the beginning with the Father; that which is Spirit, even the
Spirit of truth;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:24">93:24</span></span> And truth
is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to
come;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:25">93:25</span></span> And
whatsoever is more or less than this is the spirit of that wicked one
who was a liar from the beginning.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:26">93:26</span></span> The
Spirit of truth is of God. I am the Spirit of truth, and John bore
record of me, saying: He received a fulness of truth, yea, even of all
truth;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:27">93:27</span></span> And no
man receiveth a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:28">93:28</span></span> He that
keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is
glorified in truth and knoweth all things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:29">93:29</span></span> Man was
also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was
not created or made, neither indeed can be.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:30">93:30</span></span> All truth
is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for
itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:31">93:31</span></span> Behold,
here is the agency of man, and here is the condemnation of man; because
that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them, and
they receive not the light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:32">93:32</span></span> And every
man whose spirit receiveth not the light is under condemnation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:33">93:33</span></span> For man
is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably
connected, receive a fulness of joy;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:34">93:34</span></span> And when
separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:35">93:35</span></span> The
elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of God,
even temples; and whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy that
temple.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:36">93:36</span></span> The glory
of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:37">93:37</span></span> Light and
truth forsake that evil one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:38">93:38</span></span> Every
spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man
from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before
God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:39">93:39</span></span> And that
wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience,
from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:40">93:40</span></span> But I
have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:41">93:41</span></span> But
verily I say unto you, my servant Frederick G. Williams, you have
continued under this condemnation;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:42">93:42</span></span> You have
not taught your children light and truth, according to the commandments;
and that wicked one hath power, as yet, over you, and this is the cause
of your affliction.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:43">93:43</span></span> And now a
commandment I give unto you—if you will be delivered you shall set in
order your own house, for there are many things that are not right in
your house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:44">93:44</span></span> Verily, I
say unto my servant Sidney Rigdon, that in some things he hath not kept
the commandments concerning his children; therefore, first set in order
thy house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:45">93:45</span></span> Verily, I
say unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., or in other words, I will call
you friends, for you are my friends, and ye shall have an inheritance
with me—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:46">93:46</span></span> I called
you servants for the world's sake, and ye are their servants for my
sake—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:47">93:47</span></span> And now,
verily I say unto Joseph Smith, Jun.—You have not kept the commandments,
and must needs stand rebuked before the Lord;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:48">93:48</span></span> Your
family must needs repent and forsake some things, and give more earnest
heed unto your sayings, or be removed out of their place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:49">93:49</span></span> What I
say unto one I say unto all; pray always lest that wicked one have power
in you, and remove you out of your place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:50">93:50</span></span> My
servant Newel K. Whitney also, a bishop of my church, hath need to be
chastened, and set in order his family, and see that they are more
diligent and concerned at home, and pray always, or they shall be
removed out of their place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:51">93:51</span></span> Now, I
say unto you, my friends, let my servant Sidney Rigdon go on his
journey, and make haste, and also proclaim the acceptable year of the
Lord, and the gospel of salvation, as I shall give him utterance; and by
your prayer of faith with one consent I will uphold him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:52">93:52</span></span> And let
my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Frederick G. Williams make haste
also, and it shall be given them even according to the prayer of faith;
and inasmuch as you keep my sayings you shall not be confounded in this
world, nor in the world to come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93:53">93:53</span></span> And,
verily I say unto you, that it is my will that you should hasten to
translate my scriptures, and to obtain a knowledge of history, and of
countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man, and all this for the
salvation of Zion. Amen.
