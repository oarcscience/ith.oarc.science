### 22. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Manchester, New York, April 1830. * History of the Church* 1:79-80.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:1">22:1</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you that all old covenants have I caused to be done away in
this thing; and this is a new and an everlasting covenant, even that
which was from the beginning.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:2">22:2</span></span> Wherefore,
although a man should be baptized an hundred times it availeth him
nothing, for you cannot enter in at the strait gate by the law of Moses,
neither by your dead works.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:3">22:3</span></span> For it is
because of your dead works that I have caused this last covenant and
this church to be built up unto me, even as in days of old.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_22:4">22:4</span></span> Wherefore,
enter ye in at the gate, as I have commanded, and seek not to counsel
your God. Amen.
