### 75. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Amherst, Ohio, January 25, 1832. * History of the Church* 1:242-45.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:1">75:1</span></span> Verily,
verily, I say unto you, I who speak even by the voice of my Spirit, even
Alpha and Omega, your Lord and your God—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:2">75:2</span></span> Hearken, O
ye who have given your names to go forth to proclaim my gospel, and to
prune my vineyard.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:3">75:3</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you that it is my will that you should go forth and not tarry,
neither be idle but labor with your might—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:4">75:4</span></span> Lifting up
your voices as with the sound of a trump, proclaiming the truth
according to the revelations and commandments which I have given you.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:5">75:5</span></span> And thus,
if ye are faithful ye shall be laden with many sheaves, and crowned with
honor, and glory, and immortality, and eternal life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:6">75:6</span></span> Therefore,
verily I say unto my servant William E. McLellin, I revoke the
commission which I gave unto him to go unto the eastern countries;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:7">75:7</span></span> And I give
unto him a new commission and a new commandment, in the which I, the
Lord, chasten him for the murmurings of his heart;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:8">75:8</span></span> And he
sinned; nevertheless, I forgive him and say unto him again, Go ye into
the south countries.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:9">75:9</span></span> And let my
servant Luke Johnson go with him, and proclaim the things which I have
commanded them—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:10">75:10</span></span> Calling
on the name of the Lord for the Comforter, which shall teach them all
things that are expedient for them—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:11">75:11</span></span> Praying
always that they faint not; and inasmuch as they do this, I will be with
them even unto the end.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:12">75:12</span></span> Behold,
this is the will of the Lord your God concerning you. Even so. Amen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:13">75:13</span></span> And
again, verily thus saith the Lord, let my servant Orson Hyde and my
servant Samuel H. Smith take their journey into the eastern countries,
and proclaim the things which I have commanded them; and inasmuch as
they are faithful, lo, I will be with them even unto the end.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:14">75:14</span></span> And
again, verily I say unto my servant Lyman Johnson, and unto my servant
Orson Pratt, they shall also take their journey into the eastern
countries; and behold, and lo, I am with them also, even unto the end.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:15">75:15</span></span> And
again, I say unto my servant Asa Dodds, and unto my servant Calves
Wilson, that they also shall take their journey unto the western
countries, and proclaim my gospel, even as I have commanded them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:16">75:16</span></span> And he
who is faithful shall overcome all things, and shall be lifted up at the
last day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:17">75:17</span></span> And
again, I say unto my servant Major N. Ashley, and my servant Burr Riggs,
let them take their journey also into the south country.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:18">75:18</span></span> Yea, let
all those take their journey, as I have commanded them, going from house
to house, and from village to village, and from city to city.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:19">75:19</span></span> And in
whatsoever house ye enter, and they receive you, leave your blessing
upon that house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:20">75:20</span></span> And in
whatsoever house ye enter, and they receive you not, ye shall depart
speedily from that house, and shake off the dust of your feet as a
testimony against them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:21">75:21</span></span> And you
shall be filled with joy and gladness; and know this, that in the day of
judgment you shall be judges of that house, and condemn them;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:22">75:22</span></span> And it
shall be more tolerable for the heathen in the day of judgment, than for
that house; therefore, gird up your loins and be faithful, and ye shall
overcome all things, and be lifted up at the last day. Even so. Amen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:23">75:23</span></span> And
again, thus saith the Lord unto you, O ye elders of my church, who have
given your names that you might know his will concerning you—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:24">75:24</span></span> Behold, I
say unto you, that it is the duty of the church to assist in supporting
the families of those, and also to support the families of those who are
called and must needs be sent unto the world to proclaim the gospel unto
the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:25">75:25</span></span>
Wherefore, I, the Lord, give unto you this commandment, that ye obtain
places for your families, inasmuch as your brethren are willing to open
their hearts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:26">75:26</span></span> And let
all such as can obtain places for their families, and support of the
church for them, not fail to go into the world, whether to the east or
to the west, or to the north, or to the south.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:27">75:27</span></span> Let them
ask and they shall receive, knock and it shall be opened unto them, and
be made known from on high, even by the Comforter, whither they shall
go.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:28">75:28</span></span> And
again, verily I say unto you, that every man who is obliged to provide
for his own family, let him provide, and he shall in nowise lose his
crown; and let him labor in the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:29">75:29</span></span> Let every
man be diligent in all things. And the idler shall not have place in the
church, except he repent and mend his ways.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:30">75:30</span></span>
Wherefore, let my servant Simeon Carter and my servant Emer Harris be
united in the ministry;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:31">75:31</span></span> And also
my servant Ezra Thayre and my servant Thomas B. Marsh;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:32">75:32</span></span> Also my
servant Hyrum Smith and my servant Reynolds Cahoon;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:33">75:33</span></span> And also
my servant Daniel Stanton and my servant Seymour Brunson;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:34">75:34</span></span> And also
my servant Sylvester Smith and my servant Gideon Carter;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:35">75:35</span></span> And also
my servant Ruggles Eames and my servant Stephen Burnett;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_75:36">75:36</span></span> And also
my servant Micah B. Welton and also my servant Eden Smith. Even so.
Amen.
