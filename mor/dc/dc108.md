### 108. Revelation through Joseph Smith, Kirtland, Ohio, December 26, 1835. * History of the Church* 2:345.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_108:1">108:1</span></span> Verily
thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Lyman: Your sins are forgiven
you, because you have obeyed my voice in coming up hither this morning
to receive counsel of him whom I have appointed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_108:2">108:2</span></span>
Therefore, let your soul be at rest concerning your spiritual standing,
and resist no more my voice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_108:3">108:3</span></span> And arise
up and be more careful henceforth in observing your vows, which you have
made and do make, and you shall be blessed with exceeding great
blessings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_108:4">108:4</span></span> Wait
patiently until the solemn assembly shall be called of my servants, then
you shall be remembered with the first of mine elders, and receive right
by ordination with the rest of mine elders whom I have chosen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_108:5">108:5</span></span> Behold,
this is the promise of the Father unto you if you continue faithful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_108:6">108:6</span></span> And it
shall be fulfilled upon you in that day that you shall have right to
preach my gospel wheresoever I shall send you, from henceforth from that
time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_108:7">108:7</span></span>
Therefore, strengthen your brethren in all your conversation, in all
your prayers, in all your exhortations, and in all your doings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_108:8">108:8</span></span> And
behold, and lo, I am with you to bless you and deliver you forever.
Amen.
