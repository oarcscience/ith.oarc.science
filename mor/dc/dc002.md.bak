### 2. Words of Moroni to Joseph Smith, Manchester, New York, September 21, 1823. * History of the Church* 1:12.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2:1">2:1</span></span> Behold, I
will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet,
before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2:2">2:2</span></span> And he shall
plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers,
and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2:3">2:3</span></span> If it were
not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.
