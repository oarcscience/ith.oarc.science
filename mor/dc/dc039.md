### 39. Revelation through Joseph Smith to James Covill, Fayette, New York, January 5, 1831. * History of the Church* 1:143-45.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:1">39:1</span></span> Hearken and
listen to the voice of him who is from all eternity to all eternity, the
Great I AM, even Jesus Christ—

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:2">39:2</span></span> The light
and the life of the world; a light which shineth in darkness and the
darkness comprehendeth it not;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:3">39:3</span></span> The same
which came in the meridian of time unto mine own, and mine own received
me not;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:4">39:4</span></span> But to as
many as received me, gave I power to become my sons; and even so will I
give unto as many as will receive me, power to become my sons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:5">39:5</span></span> And verily,
verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth my gospel receiveth me; and he
that receiveth not my gospel receiveth not me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:6">39:6</span></span> And this is
my gospel—repentance and baptism by water, and then cometh the baptism
of fire and the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which showeth all
things, and teacheth the peaceable things of the kingdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:7">39:7</span></span> And now,
behold, I say unto you, my servant James, I have looked upon thy works
and I know thee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:8">39:8</span></span> And verily
I say unto thee, thine heart is now right before me at this time; and,
behold, I have bestowed great blessings upon thy head;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:9">39:9</span></span>
Nevertheless, thou hast seen great sorrow, for thou hast rejected me
many times because of pride and the cares of the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:10">39:10</span></span> But,
behold, the days of thy deliverance are come, if thou wilt hearken to my
voice, which saith unto thee: Arise and be baptized, and wash away your
sins, calling on my name, and you shall receive my Spirit, and a
blessing so great as you never have known.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:11">39:11</span></span> And if
thou do this, I have prepared thee for a greater work. Thou shalt preach
the fulness of my gospel, which I have sent forth in these last days,
the covenant which I have sent forth to recover my people, which are of
the house of Israel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:12">39:12</span></span> And it
shall come to pass that power shall rest upon thee; thou shalt have
great faith, and I will be with thee and go before thy face.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:13">39:13</span></span> Thou art
called to labor in my vineyard, and to build up my church, and to bring
forth Zion, that it may rejoice upon the hills and flourish.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:14">39:14</span></span> Behold,
verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou art not called to go into the
eastern countries, but thou art called to go to the Ohio.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:15">39:15</span></span> And
inasmuch as my people shall assemble themselves at the Ohio, I have kept
in store a blessing such as is not known among the children of men, and
it shall be poured forth upon their heads. And from thence men shall go
forth into all nations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:16">39:16</span></span> Behold,
verily, verily, I say unto you, that the people in Ohio call upon me in
much faith, thinking I will stay my hand in judgment upon the nations,
but I cannot deny my word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:17">39:17</span></span> Wherefore
lay to with your might and call faithful laborers into my vineyard, that
it may be pruned for the last time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:18">39:18</span></span> And
inasmuch as they do repent and receive the fulness of my gospel, and
become sanctified, I will stay mine hand in judgment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:19">39:19</span></span>
Wherefore, go forth, crying with a loud voice, saying: The kingdom of
heaven is at hand; crying: Hosanna! blessed be the name of the Most High
God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:20">39:20</span></span> Go forth
baptizing with water, preparing the way before my face for the time of
my coming;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:21">39:21</span></span> For the
time is at hand; the day or the hour no man knoweth; but it surely shall
come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:22">39:22</span></span> And he
that receiveth these things receiveth me; and they shall be gathered
unto me in time and in eternity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:23">39:23</span></span> And
again, it shall come to pass that on as many as ye shall baptize with
water, ye shall lay your hands, and they shall receive the gift of the
Holy Ghost, and shall be looking forth for the signs of my coming, and
shall know me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39:24">39:24</span></span> Behold, I
come quickly. Even so. Amen.
