### 48. Revelation through Joseph Smith to the Church, Kirtland, Ohio, March, 1831.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_48:1">48:1</span></span> It is
necessary that ye should remain for the present time in your places of
abode, as it shall be suitable to your circumstances.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_48:2">48:2</span></span> And
inasmuch as ye have lands, ye shall impart to the eastern brethren;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_48:3">48:3</span></span> And
inasmuch as ye have not lands, let them buy for the present time in
those regions round about, as seemeth them good, for it must needs be
necessary that they have places to live for the present time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_48:4">48:4</span></span> It must
needs be necessary that ye save all the money that ye can, and that ye
obtain all that ye can in righteousness, that in time ye may be enabled
to purchase land for an inheritance, even the city.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_48:5">48:5</span></span> The place
is not yet to be revealed; but after your brethren come from the east
there are to be certain men appointed, and to them it shall be given to
know the place, or to them it shall be revealed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_48:6">48:6</span></span> And they
shall be appointed to purchase the lands, and to make a commencement to
lay the foundation of the city; and then shall ye begin to be gathered
with your families, every man according to his family, according to his
circumstances, and as is appointed to him by the presidency and the
bishop of the church, according to the laws and commandments which ye
have received, and which ye shall hereafter receive. Even so. Amen.
