### 99. Revelation through Joseph Smith to John Murdock, August 1832, Hiram, Ohio.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_99:1">99:1</span></span> Behold,
thus saith the Lord unto my servant John Murdock—thou art called to go
into the eastern countries from house to house, from village to village,
and from city to city, to proclaim mine everlasting gospel unto the
inhabitants thereof, in the midst of persecution and wickedness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_99:2">99:2</span></span> And who
receiveth you receiveth me; and you shall have power to declare my word
in the demonstration of my Holy Spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_99:3">99:3</span></span> And who
receiveth you as a little child, receiveth my kingdom; and blessed are
they, for they shall obtain mercy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_99:4">99:4</span></span> And whoso
rejecteth you shall be rejected of my Father and his house; and you
shall cleanse your feet in the secret places by the way for a testimony
against them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_99:5">99:5</span></span> And behold,
and lo, I come quickly to judgment, to convince all of their ungodly
deeds which they have committed against me, as it is written of me in
the volume of the book.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_99:6">99:6</span></span> And now,
verily I say unto you, that it is not expedient that you should go until
your children are provided for, and sent up kindly unto the bishop of
Zion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_99:7">99:7</span></span> And after a
few years, if thou desirest of me, thou mayest go up also unto the
goodly land, to possess thine inheritance;

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_99:8">99:8</span></span> Otherwise
thou shalt continue proclaiming my gospel until thou be taken. Amen.
