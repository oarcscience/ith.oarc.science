<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_129:1">129:1</A></FONT></span> There are two kinds of beings in heaven, namely: Angels, who are resurrected personages, having bodies of flesh and bones&#8212;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_129:2">129:2</A></FONT></span> For instance, Jesus said: <i>Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not</i> <i>flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</i></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_129:3">129:3</A></FONT></span> Secondly: the spirits of just men made perfect, they who are not resurrected, but inherit the same glory.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_129:4">129:4</A></FONT></span> When a messenger comes saying he has a message from God, offer him your hand and request him to shake hands with you.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_129:5">129:5</A></FONT></span> If he be an angel he will do so, and you will feel his hand.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_129:6">129:6</A></FONT></span> If he be the spirit of a just man made perfect he will come in his glory; for that is the only way he can appear&#8212;</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_129:7">129:7</A></FONT></span> Ask him to shake hands with you, but he will not move, because it is contrary to the order of heaven for a just man to deceive; but he will still deliver his message.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_129:8">129:8</A></FONT></span> If it be the devil as an angel of light, when you ask him to shake hands he will offer you his hand, and you will not feel anything; you may therefore detect him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_129:9">129:9</A></FONT></span> These are three grand keys whereby you may know whether any administration is from God. </p>
