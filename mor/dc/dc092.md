### 92. Revelation to Joseph Smith, Kirtland, Ohio, March 15, 1833. * History of the Church* 1:333.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_92:1">92:1</span></span> Verily,
thus saith the Lord, I give unto the united order, organized agreeable
to the commandment previously given, a revelation and commandment
concerning my servant Frederick G. Williams, that ye shall receive him
into the order. What I say unto one I say unto all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_92:2">92:2</span></span> And again,
I say unto you my servant Frederick G. Williams, you shall be a lively
member in this order; and inasmuch as you are faithful in keeping all
former commandments you shall be blessed forever. Amen.
