# Pearl of Great Price: Moses: Chapter 6

<span id="v1">  1 And Adam hearkened unto the voice of God, and called
upon his sons to repent.</span>  
<span id="v2">  2 And Adam knew his wife again, and she bare a son, and
he called his name Seth. And Adam glorified the name of God; for he
said: God hath appointed me another seed, instead of Abel, whom Cain
slew.</span>  
<span id="v3">  3 And God revealed himself unto Seth, and he rebelled
not, but offered an acceptable sacrifice, like unto his brother Abel.
And to him also was born a son, and he called his name Enos.</span>  
<span id="v4">  4 And then began these men to call upon the name of the
Lord, and the Lord blessed them;</span>  
<span id="v5">  5 And a book of remembrance was kept, in the which was
recorded, in the language of Adam, for it was given unto as many as
called upon God to write by the spirit of inspiration;</span>  
<span id="v6">  6 And by them their children were taught to read and
write, having a language which was pure and undefiled.</span>  
<span id="v7">  7 Now this same Priesthood, which was in the beginning,
shall be in the end of the world also.</span>  
<span id="v8">  8 Now this prophecy Adam spake, as he was moved upon by
the Holy Ghost, and a genealogy was kept of the children of God. And
this was the book of the generations of Adam, saying: In the day that
God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;</span>  
<span id="v9">  9 In the image of his own body, male and female, created
he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when
they were created and became living souls in the land upon the footstool
of God.</span>  
<span id="v10">  10 And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years, and
begat a son in his own likeness, after his own image, and called his
name Seth.</span>  
<span id="v11">  11 And the days of Adam, after he had begotten Seth,
were eight hundred years, and he begat many sons and daughters;</span>  
<span id="v12">  12 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred
and thirty years, and he died.</span>  
<span id="v13">  13 Seth lived one hundred and five years, and begat
Enos, and prophesied in all his days, and taught his son Enos in the
ways of God; wherefore Enos prophesied also.</span>  
<span id="v14">  14 And Seth lived, after he begat Enos, eight hundred
and seven years, and begat many sons and daughters.</span>  
<span id="v15">  15 And the children of men were numerous upon all the
face of the land. And in those days Satan had great dominion among men,
and raged in their hearts; and from thenceforth came wars and bloodshed;
and a man's hand was against his own brother, in administering death,
because of secret works, seeking for power.</span>  
<span id="v16">  16 All the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve
years, and he died.</span>  
<span id="v17">  17 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan. And
Enos and the residue of the people of God came out from the land, which
was called Shulon, and dwelt in a land of promise, which he called after
his own son, whom he had named Cainan.</span>  
<span id="v18">  18 And Enos lived, after he begat Cainan, eight hundred
and fifteen years, and begat many sons and daughters. And all the days
of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he died.</span>  
<span id="v19">  19 And Cainan lived seventy years, and begat
Mahalaleel; and Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and
forty years, and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of Cainan
were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.</span>  
<span id="v20">  20 And Mahalaleel lived sixty-five years, and begat
Jared; and Mahalaleel lived, after he begat Jared, eight hundred and
thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of
Mahalaleel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he
died.</span>  
<span id="v21">  21 And Jared lived one hundred and sixty-two years, and
begat Enoch; and Jared lived, after he begat Enoch, eight hundred years,
and begat sons and daughters. And Jared taught Enoch in all the ways of
God.</span>  
<span id="v22">  22 And this is the genealogy of the sons of Adam, who
was the son of God, with whom God, himself, conversed.</span>  
<span id="v23">  23 And they were preachers of righteousness, and spake
and prophesied, and called upon all men, everywhere, to repent; and
faith was taught unto the children of men.</span>  
<span id="v24">  24 And it came to pass that all the days of Jared were
nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.</span>  
<span id="v25">  25 And Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begat
Methuselah.</span>  
<span id="v26">  26 And it came to pass that Enoch journeyed in the
land, among the people; and as he journeyed, the Spirit of God descended
out of heaven, and abode upon him.</span>  
<span id="v27">  27 And he heard a voice from heaven, saying: Enoch, my
son, prophesy unto this people, and say unto them÷Repent, for thus saith
the Lord: I am angry with this people, and my fierce anger is kindled
against them; for their hearts have waxed hard, and their ears are dull
of hearing, and their eyes cannot see afar off;</span>  
<span id="v28">  28 And for these many generations, ever since the day
that I created them, have they gone astray, and have denied me, and have
sought their own counsels in the dark; and in their own abominations
have they devised murder, and have not kept the commandments, which I
gave unto their father, Adam.</span>  
<span id="v29">  29 Wherefore, they have foresworn themselves, and, by
their oaths, they have brought upon themselves death; and a hell I have
prepared for them, if they repent not;</span>  
<span id="v30">  30 And this is a decree, which I have sent forth in the
beginning of the world, from my own mouth, from the foundation thereof,
and by the mouths of my servants, thy fathers, have I decreed it, even
as it shall be sent forth in the world, unto the ends thereof.</span>  
<span id="v31">  31 And when Enoch had heard these words, he bowed
himself to the earth, before the Lord, and spake before the Lord,
saying: Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a
lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I
thy servant?</span>  
<span id="v32">  32 And the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I
have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. Open thy mouth, and
it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance, for all flesh is in
my hands, and I will do as seemeth me good.</span>  
<span id="v33">  33 Say unto this people: Choose ye this day, to serve
the Lord God who made you.</span>  
<span id="v34">  34 Behold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore all thy
words will I justify; and the mountains shall flee before you, and the
rivers shall turn from their course; and thou shalt abide in me, and I
in you; therefore walk with me.</span>  
<span id="v35">  35 And the Lord spake unto Enoch, and said unto him:
Anoint thine eyes with clay, and wash them, and thou shalt see. And he
did so.</span>  
<span id="v36">  36 And he beheld the spirits that God had created; and
he beheld also things which were not visible to the natural eye; and
from thenceforth came the saying abroad in the land: A seer hath the
Lord raised up unto his people.</span>  
<span id="v37">  37 And it came to pass that Enoch went forth in the
land, among the people, standing upon the hills and the high places, and
cried with a loud voice, testifying against their works; and all men
were offended because of him.</span>  
<span id="v38">  38 And they came forth to hear him, upon the high
places, saying unto the tent-keepers: Tarry ye here and keep the tents,
while we go yonder to behold the seer, for he prophesieth, and there is
a strange thing in the land; a wild man hath come among us.</span>  
<span id="v39">  39 And it came to pass when they heard him, no man laid
hands on him; for fear came on all them that heard him; for he walked
with God.</span>  
<span id="v40">  40 And there came a man unto him, whose name was
Mahijah, and said unto him: Tell us plainly who thou art, and from
whence thou comest?</span>  
<span id="v41">  41 And he said unto them: I came out from the land of
Cainan, the land of my fathers, a land of righteousness unto this day.
And my father taught me in all the ways of God.</span>  
<span id="v42">  42 And it came to pass, as I journeyed from the land of
Cainan, by the sea east, I beheld a vision; and lo, the heavens I saw,
and the Lord spake with me, and gave me commandment; wherefore, for this
cause, to keep the commandment, I speak forth these words.</span>  
<span id="v43">  43 And Enoch continued his speech, saying: The Lord
which spake with me, the same is the God of heaven, and he is my God,
and your God, and ye are my brethren, and why counsel ye yourselves, and
deny the God of heaven?</span>  
<span id="v44">  44 The heavens he made; the earth is his footstool; and
the foundation thereof is his. Behold, he laid it, an host of men hath
he brought in upon the face thereof.</span>  
<span id="v45">  45 And death hath come upon our fathers; nevertheless
we know them, and cannot deny, and even the first of all we know, even
Adam.</span>  
<span id="v46">  46 For a book of remembrance we have written among us,
according to the pattern given by the finger of God; and it is given in
our own language.</span>  
<span id="v47">  47 And as Enoch spake forth the words of God, the
people trembled, and could not stand in his presence.</span>  
<span id="v48">  48 And he said unto them: Because that Adam fell, we
are; and by his fall came death; and we are made partakers of misery and
woe.</span>  
<span id="v49">  49 Behold Satan hath come among the children of men,
and tempteth them to worship him; and men have become carnal, sensual,
and devilish, and are shut out from the presence of God.</span>  
<span id="v50">  50 But God hath made known unto our fathers that all
men must repent.</span>  
<span id="v51">  51 And he called upon our father Adam by his own voice,
saying: I am God; I made the world, and men before they were in the
flesh.</span>  
<span id="v52">  52 And he also said unto him: If thou wilt turn unto
me, and hearken unto my voice, and believe, and repent of all thy
transgressions, and be baptized, even in water, in the name of mine Only
Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth, which is Jesus Christ, the
only name which shall be given under heaven, whereby salvation shall
come unto the children of men, ye shall receive the gift of the Holy
Ghost, asking all things in his name, and whatsoever ye shall ask, it
shall be given you.</span>  
<span id="v53">  53 And our father Adam spake unto the Lord, and said:
Why is it that men must repent and be baptized in water? And the Lord
said unto Adam: Behold I have forgiven thee thy transgression in the
Garden of Eden.</span>  
<span id="v54">  54 Hence came the saying abroad among the people, that
the Son of God hath atoned for original guilt, wherein the sins of the
parents cannot be answered upon the heads of the children, for they are
whole from the foundation of the world.</span>  
<span id="v55">  55 And the Lord spake unto Adam, saying: Inasmuch as
thy children are conceived in sin, even so when they begin to grow up,
sin conceiveth in their hearts, and they taste the bitter, that they may
know to prize the good.</span>  
<span id="v56">  56 And it is given unto them to know good from evil;
wherefore they are agents unto themselves, and I have given unto you
another law and commandment.</span>  
<span id="v57">  57 Wherefore teach it unto your children, that all men,
everywhere, must repent, or they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of
God, for no unclean thing can dwell there, or dwell in his presence;
for, in the language of Adam, Man of Holiness is his name, and the name
of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man, even Jesus Christ, a righteous
Judge, who shall come in the meridian of time.</span>  
<span id="v58">  58 Therefore I give unto you a commandment, to teach
these things freely unto your children, saying:</span>  
<span id="v59">  59 That by reason of transgression cometh the fall,
which fall bringeth death, and inasmuch as ye were born into the world
by water, and blood, and the spirit, which I have made, and so became of
dust a living soul, even so ye must be born again into the kingdom of
heaven, of water, and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by blood, even the
blood of mine Only Begotten; that ye might be sanctified from all sin,
and enjoy the words of eternal life in this world, and eternal life in
the world to come, even immortal glory;</span>  
<span id="v60">  60 For by the water ye keep the commandment; by the
Spirit ye are justified, and by the blood ye are sanctified;</span>  
<span id="v61">  61 Therefore it is given to abide in you; the record of
heaven; the Comforter; the peaceable things of immortal glory; the truth
of all things; that which quickeneth all things, which maketh alive all
things; that which knoweth all things, and hath all power according to
wisdom, mercy, truth, justice, and judgment.</span>  
<span id="v62">  62 And now, behold, I say unto you: This is the plan of
salvation unto all men, through the blood of mine Only Begotten, who
shall come in the meridian of time.</span>  
<span id="v63">  63 And behold, all things have their likeness, and all
things are created and made to bear record of me, both things which are
temporal, and things which are spiritual; things which are in the
heavens above, and things which are on the earth, and things which are
in the earth, and things which are under the earth, both above and
beneath: all things bear record of me.</span>  
<span id="v64">  64 And it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with
Adam, our father, that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away
by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was
laid under the water, and was brought forth out of the water.</span>  
<span id="v65">  65 And thus he was baptized, and the Spirit of God
descended upon him, and thus he was born of the Spirit, and became
quickened in the inner man.</span>  
<span id="v66">  66 And he heard a voice out of heaven, saying: Thou art
baptized with fire, and with the Holy Ghost. This is the record of the
Father, and the Son, from henceforth and forever;</span>  
<span id="v67">  67 And thou art after the order of him who was without
beginning of days or end of years, from all eternity to all
eternity.</span>  
<span id="v68">  68 Behold, thou art one in me, a son of God; and thus
may all become my sons. Amen.</span>
