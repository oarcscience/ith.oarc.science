<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">CHAPTER VI</h1>
<h1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE GOAL-AND AFTER</h1>
<p ALIGN="left">Here we were then (as I saw the situation) assured of our statehood, 
rid of polygamy, relieved of religious control in politics, and free to devote our 
energies to the development of the land and the industries and the business of the 
community. The persecutions that our people had borne had schooled them to co-operation. 
They were ready, helping one another, to advance together to a common prosperity. 
They were under the leadership chiefly of the man who had guided them out of a most 
desperate condition of oppression toward the freedom of sovereign self-government. 
In that progress he had saved everything that was worthy in the Mormon communism; 
he had discarded much that was a curse. I knew that he had no thought but for the 
welfare of the people; and with such a man, leading such a following, we seemed 
certain of a future that should be an example to the world.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">But both the Church and the people had been involved in debt 
by confiscation and proscription; and it was necessary now to free ourselves financially. 
This work my father undertook in behalf of the Presidency-for the President of the 
Mormon Church is not only the Prophet, Seer and Revelator of God to the faithful; 
he is also &quot;the trustee in trust&quot; of all the Church&#39;s material property. He is the 
controller, almost the owner, of everything it owns. He is as sacred in his financial 
as in his religious absolutism. He is accountable to no-one. The Church auditors, 
whom he appoints, concern themselves merely with the details of bookkeeping. The 
millions of dollars that are paid to him, by the people in tithes, are used by him 
as he sees fit to use them; and the annual contributors to this &quot;common fund&quot; would 
no more question his administration of it than they would question the ways of divinity.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">In the early days there had been a strongly animating idea that 
among the divinely-authorized duties of leadership was the obligation to develop 
the natural resources of the country in order to meet the people&#39;s needs. As the 
immigrants poured into Utah, these needs increased; and the Church leaders used 
the Church funds to develop coal and iron mines, support salt gardens, build a railway, 
establish a sugar factory (for which the people, through the legislature, voted 
a bounty), conduct a beach resort, and aid a hundred other enterprises that promised 
to be for the public good. These undertakings were not financed for profit. They 
were semi-socialistic in their establishment and half-benevolent in their administration.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">But during &quot;the days of the raid&quot; they were neglected, because 
the Church was involved in debt. And now it became pressingly necessary to obtain 
money to restore the moribund industries and to meet the payments that were continually 
falling due upon loans made to the Presidency. President Woodruff called on me to 
aid in the work. So I came into touch with a development of events that did not 
seem to me, then, of any great importance; yet it drew as its consequence a connection 
between the Mormon Church and the great financial &quot;interests&quot; of the East-a connection 
that is one of the strong determining causes of the perversion of government and 
denial of political liberty in Utah today.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I wish, here, simply to foreshadow this connection. It will reappear 
in the story again and again; and it is necessary to have the significance of the 
recurrence understood in advance. But, at the time of which I write, there was no 
more than an innocent approach on our part to Eastern financiers to obtain money 
for the Church and to concentrate our debts in the hands of two or three New York 
banks.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">For example, the Church had loaned to, or endorsed for, the Utah 
Sugar Company to the amount of $325,000; and my father had personally endorsed the 
general obligations for this and other sums, although he owned only $5,000 of the 
company&#39;s stock. He supported the factory with his personal credit and assumed the 
risk of loss (without any corresponding possibility of gain) in order to benefit 
the whole people by encouraging the beet sugar industry. A vain attempt had been 
made to sell the bonds in New York. Finally, the Church bought all the bonds of 
the company for $325,000 (of a face value of $400,000), and we sold them, for the 
Church, to Mr. Joseph Bannigan, the &quot;rubber king,&quot; of Providence, Rhode Island, 
for $360,000, with the guarantee of the First Presidency, the trustee of the Church, 
and myself.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Similarly, the First Presidency led in building an electric power 
plant in Ogden, after Chas. K. Bannister, a great engineer, and myself had persuaded 
the members of the Presidency that the work would benefit the community. The bonds 
of this company, too, were bought by Mr. Bannigan, with the guarantee of the trustee 
of the Church, the Presidency and myself. Both the power plant and the sugar factory 
were financially successful. They performed a large public service beneficently. 
The fact that Mr. Bannigan held their bonds was no detriment to their work and wrought 
no injury to the people.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I single out these two enterprises because Joseph F. Smith has 
since sold the power plant to the &quot;Harriman interests,&quot; and the control of the sugar 
factory to the sugar trust; and he has explained that in making the sales he merely 
followed my father&#39;s example and mine in selling the bonds to Mr. Bannigan. The 
power plant is now a part of the merger called the Utah Light and Railway Company, 
which has a monopoly right in all the streets of Salt Lake City and its suburbs, 
besides owning the electric power and light plants of Salt Lake City and Ogden, 
the gas plants of both these cities, and the natural gas wells and pipe lines supplying 
them. The Mormon people whose tithes aided these properties-whose good-will maintained 
them-whose leaders designed them as a community work for a community benefit-these 
people are now being mercilessly exploited by the Eastern &quot;interests&quot; to whom the 
Prophet of the Church has sold them bodily. The difference between selling the bonds 
of the sugar company to Bannigan, in order to raise money to support the factory, 
and selling half the stock to the sugar trust, in order to make a monopoly profit 
out of the Mormon consumers of sugar, has either not occurred to Smith or has been 
divinely waived by him.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">However, this is by the way and in advance of my story. In 1894 
we had no more fear of the Eastern money power than we had of the return of the 
Church to politics or to polygamy. Throughout 1893 and 1894 I was engaged in the 
work of re-establishing the Church&#39;s business affairs with my father and a sort 
of finance committee of which the other two members were Colonel N. W. Clayton, 
of Salt Lake City, and Mr. James Jack, the cashier of the Church. In the summer 
of 1894 I heard various rumors that when Utah should gain its statehood, my father 
would probably be a candidate for the United States Senate. Since this would be 
a palpable breach of the Church&#39;s agreement to keep out of politics, I took occasion-one 
day, on a railroad journey-to ask him if he intended to be a candidate.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He told me that he was being urged to stand for the Senatorship, 
but that for his part he had no desire to do so; and he asked me what I thought 
about it. I replied that if I had felt it was right for him to take the office and 
he desired it, I would walk barefoot across the continent to aid him. But I reminded 
him of the pledges which he and I had made repeatedly-on our own behalf, in the 
name of his associates in leadership, and on the honor of the Mormon people-to subdue 
thereafter the causes of the controversy that had divided Mormon and Gentile in 
Utah. He replied with an emphatic assurance of his purpose to keep those pledges, 
and dismissed the subject with a finality that left no doubt in my mind.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I know that he might have desired the Senatorship as a public 
vindication, since, in the old days of quarrel, he had been legislated out of his 
place in the House of Representatives; and, for the first and only time in my life, 
I undertook to philosophize some comfort for him-out of the fact that to the position 
of authority which he held in Utah a Senator-ship was a descent. He replied dryly: 
&quot;I understand, my son-perfectly.&quot; The fact was that he needed no comfort from me 
or any other human being. He seemed all-sufficient to himself, because of the abiding 
sense he had of the constant presence of God and his habit of communing with that 
Spirit, instead of seeking human intercourse or earthly counsel. He did not need 
my affection. He did not need, much less seek, the approbation of any man. In the 
events to which this conversation was a prelude, he acted without explaining himself 
to me or to anyone else, and apparently without caring in the slightest what my 
opinion or any other man&#39;s might be of his course or of the motives that prompted 
it.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Some months later, in the office of the Presidency (at a business 
meeting with him, Colonel Clayton and Joseph F. Smith), I excused myself from attending 
any further sittings of the committee for that day, because I had to go to Provo 
to receive the Republican nomination for Congress.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">My father said: &quot;I am sorry to hear it. I thought Judge Zane-or 
someone else-would be nominated. I wished you to be free to help with these business 
matters. Why have you not consulted us?&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I reminded him that I had told him, some weeks before, that I 
expected to be nominated for Congress this year-and that I was practically certain, 
if elected, of going to the Senate when we were granted statehood. &quot;I talked with 
you, then, as my father,&quot; I said. &quot;But I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll remember that I have not 
consulted you as a leader of the Church, or any of your colleagues as leaders of 
the Church, on the subject of partisan politics since the People&#39;s Party was dissolved.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">He accepted this mild declaration of political independence without 
protest, and I went to Provo, happily, a free man. The Republicans nominated me 
by acclamation, and the chairman of the committee that came to offer me the nomination 
was Colonel Wm. Nelson, then managing editor of the <i>Salt Lake Tribune,</i> a 
Gentile, a former leader of the Liberal Party, an opponent of Mormonism as practised, 
who had fought the Church hierarchy for years. Here was a new evidence that we were 
now beyond the old quarrels-a further guarantee that we were prepared to take our 
place among the states of the Union, free of parochialism and its sectarian enmities.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The campaign gave every proof of such political emancipation. 
The people divided, on national party lines, as completely as any American community 
in my experience. The Democrats, having nominated Joseph L. Rawlins, had the prestige 
that he had gained in helping to pass the Enabling Act; a Democratic administration 
was in power in Washington; Apostle Moses Thatcher, Brigham H. Roberts, and other 
members of the Church inspired the old loyalty of the Mormons for the Democracy. 
But the Republicans had been re-enforced by the dissolution of the Liberal Party, 
whose last preceding candidate (Mr. Clarence E. Alien) went on the stump for us. 
The Smith jealousy of Moses Thatcher divided the Church influence; and though charges 
of ecclesiastical interference were made on both sides, such interference was personal 
rather than official. Mr. Rawlins was defeated, and I was elected delegate in Congress 
from the territory-with the United States Senatorship practically assured to me.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">In the spring of 1895 the constitutional convention at Salt Lake 
City formulated a provisional constitution for the new Utah; and, in the Fall of 
the year, a general election was held to adopt this constitution and to elect officers 
who should enter upon their duties as soon as Utah became a state. The election 
was marked by a most significant and important incident.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The Democrats, in their convention, nominated for Congress, Brigham 
H. Roberts, one of the first seven &quot;presidents of the seventy,&quot; and for the United 
States Senate, Joseph L. Rawlins and Apostle Moses Thatcher. Immediately, at a priesthood 
meeting of the hierarchy, Joseph F. Smith denounced the candidacies of Roberts and 
Thatcher; and the grounds for the denunciation were subsequently stated in the &quot;political 
manifesto&quot; of April, 1896, in which the First Presidency announced, as a rule of 
the Church, that no official of the Church should accept a political nomination 
until he had obtained the permission of the Church authorities and had learned from 
them whether he could &quot;consistently with the obligations already entered into with 
the Church, take upon himself the added duties and labors and responsibilities of 
the new position.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">This action, I knew, was the result of the old jealousy of Thatcher 
which the Smiths had so long nursed. But it was also in line with the Church&#39;s pledge, 
to keep its leaders out of politics. By it, the hierarchy bound themselves and set 
the people free. The leaders, thereafter, according to their own &quot;manifesto,&quot; could 
not enter politics without the consent of their quorums; and, therefore, by any 
American doctrine, they could not enter politics at all. Thatcher and Roberts revolted 
against the inhibition as an infringement of their rights as citizens, and it was 
so construed by the whole Democratic party; but everyone knew that a Mormon apostle 
had no rights as a citizen that were not second to his Church allegiance, and the 
political manifesto simply made public the fact of such subservience, authoritatively. 
We Republicans welcomed it, with our eyes on the future freedom of politics in Utah; 
Thatcher and Roberts refused to accept the dictation of their quorums, and what 
was practically an &quot;edict of apostasy&quot; went out against them. They were defeated. 
The Republican candidates (Heber M. Wells, as governor, and Clarence E. Alien, as 
member of Congress) were elected. Thatcher, subsequently refusing to accept the 
&quot;political manifesto,&quot; was deposed from his apostolic authority, and deprived of 
all priesthood in the Church. Roberts recanted and was reconciled with the hierarchy.[<a name="text1" href="#foot1">1</a>]</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The Republicans elected forty-three out of sixty-three members 
of the legislature, and everyone of these had been pledged to support me, for the 
United States Senate, either by his convention, or by letter to me, or by a promise 
conveyed to me by friends; and none of these pledges had I solicited.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The rumors of my father&#39;s candidacy now became more general-although 
he was a Democrat, although the new &quot;political manifesto&quot; bound him, although it 
was doubtful whether the Senate would allow him to be seated. Two influences were 
urging his election. One was the desire of the Smith faction to have the First Councillor 
break the ice at Washington for Apostle John Henry Smith, who was ambitious to be 
a Senator and was disqualified by the fact that he was a Church leader and a polygamist. 
The other was the desire of some Eastern capitalists to have my father&#39;s vote in 
the Senate to aid them in the promotion of a railroad from Salt Lake City to Los 
Angeles. A preliminary agreement for the construction of the road had already been 
signed by men who represented that they had close affiliations with large steel 
interests in the East, as one party, and my father as business representative of 
a group of associates, including the Presidency of the Church. The Church&#39;s interest 
in the project was communistic, and so was my father&#39;s. But his vote and influence 
in the Senate would be valuable to the promotion of the undertaking, and he had 
received written assurances from Republican leaders, senators and politicians, that 
if he were elected he would be allowed his seat.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">As a result of our Republican success in the two political campaigns 
that had just ended, I felt that I represented the independent votes of both Mormons 
and Gentiles; and I decided to confront the First Presidency (as such a representative) 
and try to make them declare themselves in the matter of my father&#39;s candidacy. 
Not that I thought his candidacy would be so vitally important-for I did not then 
believe the Church authorities had power to sway the legislature away from its pledges. 
But every day, at home or abroad, I was being asked: &quot;Are you <i>sure</i> that the 
Church&#39;s retirement from politics is sincere?&quot; My friends were accepting my word, 
and I wished to add certainty to assurance that the Church leaders intended to fulfil 
the covenant of their personal honor and respect the constitution of the state by 
keeping out of politics.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Without letting them know why I wished to see them, I procured 
an appointment for the interview. When we were all seated at the table I explained: 
&quot;I&#39;m going to Washington to attend to my duties as delegate in Congress. Before 
I return, Utah will be admitted to statehood, and the legislature will have to elects 
two United States Senators. As you all know, I&#39;ve been a candidate for one of these 
places. It has been assured to me by the probably unanimous vote of the Republican 
caucus when it shall convene. I laid my clenched hand on the table, knuckles down, 
with a calculated abruptness. &quot;The first senatorship from Utah is <i>there</i>&quot; 
I said. &quot;If it&#39;s to be disturbed by any ecclesiastical direction, I want to know 
it <i>now</i>, so that the men who are supporting me may be aware of what they must 
encounter if they persist in their support. I ask you, as the Presidency of the 
Church: what are you going to do about the Senatorship?&quot; And I opened my hand and 
left it lying open before them, for their decision.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">It was evident enough, from their expressions, that this was 
a degree of boldness to which they were unaccustomed. It was evident also that they 
were unprepared to reply to me. My father remained silent, with his usual placidity, 
waiting for the others to fail to take the initiative. President Woodruff blinked, 
somewhat bewildered, looking at my hand as if the sight of its emptiness and the 
assumption of what it held, confused him. Joseph F. Smith, frowning, eyed it askance 
with a darting glance, apparently annoyed by the mute insolence of its demand for 
a decision which he was not prepared to make.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">My father, at length, looking at me imperturbably, asked: &quot;Are 
you inquiring of our personal view in this matter, Frank?&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The question contained, of course, a tacit allusion to my refusal 
to consult the Church leaders about politics. I answered: &quot;No, sir. I already have
<i>your</i> personal view. That is the only personal view I have ever asked concerning 
the Senatorship. And I have purposely refrained from any allusions to it of late, 
with you, because I wished to lay it before the Presidency, as a body, formally, 
in order that there might be no possible misunderstanding.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&quot;In that case,&quot; he said, &quot;the matter rests with President Woodruff.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">The President, thus forced to an explanation, made a very characteristic 
one. Several of the Church&#39;s friends in the East, he said, had urged father&#39;s name 
for the Senatorship, but it was impossible to see how he could be spared from the 
affairs of the priesthood. Zion needed him-and so forth.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Apparently, to President Woodruff, the question of the Senatorship 
was resolvable wholly upon Church considerations. His mind was so filled with zealous 
hope for the advancement of &quot;the Kingdom of God on Earth,&quot; that he seemed quite 
unaware of the political aspects of the case, the violation of the Church&#39;s pledge, 
and the difficulties in the Senate that would surely attend upon my father&#39;s election.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">In the general discussion that ensued, both Joseph F. Smith and 
my father spoke of the appeal that had been made to them on behalf of the business 
interests of the community, with which the financial interests of the East were 
now eager to co-operate. But both followed the President&#39;s example in dismissing 
the possibility of the First Councillor&#39;s candidacy as infringing upon his duties 
in the Church. I pointed out to them that such a candidacy would be considered a 
breach of faith, that it would raise a storm of protest. They accepted the warning 
without comment, as if, having decided against the candidacy, they did not need 
to consider such aspects of it. I kept my hand open before them until my father 
said, with some trace of amusement: &quot;You&#39;d better take up that Senatorship, Frank. 
I think you&#39;re entitled to it.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I took it up, satisfied that there would be no more Church interference 
in the matter. The decision seemed to me final and momentous. I felt that the new 
Utah had faced the old and had been assured of independence.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">About this same time (although I cannot place it accurately in 
my recollection), President Woodruff, speaking from the pulpit, declared that it 
was the right of the priesthood of God to rule in all things on earth, and that 
they had in no wise relinquished any of their authority. The sermon raised a dangerous 
alarm in Salt Lake City, and I was immediately summoned from Ogden (by a messenger 
from Church headquarters) to see the proprietor and the editor of the <i>Salt Lake 
Tribune</i>-which paper, it was feared, might oppose Utah&#39;s admission to statehood, 
construing President Woodruff&#39;s remarks to mean that the Church&#39;s political covenants 
were to be broken.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I found Mr. P. H. Lannan, the proprietor of the paper, anxious, 
indignant and ready to denounce the Church and fight against the admission to statehood. 
&quot;When I heard of that sermon,&quot; he said, &quot;my heart went into my boots. We Gentiles 
have trusted everything to the promises that have been made by the leaders of the 
Church. If the <i>Tribune</i> had not supported the movement for statehood, the 
Gentiles would never have taken the risk. I feel like a man who has sold his brethren 
into slavery.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I assured him (as I was authorized to do) that President Woodruff 
was not speaking for our generation of the Mormon people nor for his associates 
in the leadership of the Church. I pleaded that it was the privilege of an old man 
(and President Woodruff was nearly ninety) to dream again the visions of his youth; 
his early life had been spent in the belief that a Kingdom of God was to be set 
up in the valleys of the mountains, governed by the priesthood and destined to rule 
all the nations of the earth; he had planted the first flag of the country over 
the|Salt Lake Valley; he was still living in days that had passed for all but him, 
and cherishing hopes that he alone had not abandoned. But if the <i>Tribune</i> 
and the Gentiles would be magnanimous in this matter, they would add to the gratitude 
that already bound the younger generations of the Church to the fulfilment of its 
political promises.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">Mr. Lannan responded instantly to the appeal to his generosity, 
and after consultation with the editor-in-chief (Judge C. C. Goodwin) and the managing 
editor (Colonel Wm. Nelson) the <i>Tribune</i> continued to trust in Mormon good 
faith.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I reported the result of my conference to Church headquarters. 
The news was received with relief and gratitude. And, in a long conversation with 
the authorities, I was told that it would be incumbent on us of the younger generation 
to see that all the Church&#39;s covenants to the nation should be scrupulously observed.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I accepted my part of the charge with a light heart, and late 
in November, 1895, I took train for Washington for convening of Congress. Of the 
incidents of my brief services as delegate I shall write nothing here, since those 
incidents were merely introductory to matters which I shall have to consider later. 
But I was greeted with a great deal of cordiality by the Republicans who credited 
me with having brought a state and its national representation into the Republican 
party, and they assured me that my own political future would be as bright as that 
of my native state!</p>
<p ALIGN="left">President Cleveland, on January 4, 1896, proclaimed Utah a sovereign 
state of the Union, and its admission to statehood ended, of course, my service 
as a territorial delegate.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I stood beside his desk in the White House to see him sign the 
proclamation-the same desk at which he had received me, some eight years before, 
when I came beseeching him to be merciful to the proscribed people whose freedom 
he was now announcing. Perhaps the manumission that he was granting, gave a benignity 
to his face. Perhaps the emotion in my own mind transfigured him to me. But I saw 
smiles and pathos in the ruggedness of his expression of congratulation as he said 
a few words of hope that Utah would fulfil every promise made, on her behalf, by 
her own people, and every happy expectation that had been entertained for her by 
her friends. His enormous rigid bulk, a little bowed now by years of service, seemed 
softened, as his face was, to the graciousness of clement power. He gave me the 
pen with which he had signed the paper, and dismissed me to some of the happiest 
hours of my life. I walked out of the White House dispossessed of office, but now, 
at last, a citizen of the Republic. I stood on the steps of the White House, to 
look at the city through whose streets I had so many times wandered in a worried 
despair, and I saw them with an emotion I would not dare transcribe. I do not know 
that the sun was really shining, but in my memory the scene has taken on all the 
accumulated brightnesses of all the radiant days I ever knew in Washington. And 
I remember that I saw the Washington Monument and the Capitol with a sense of almost 
affectionate <i>personal</i> possession!</p>
<p ALIGN="left">In an excited exultation I went to thank the men who had helped 
us in the House and the Senate-to wire jubilant messages home-to send Governor Wells 
the pen with which the President had signed his proclamation, and to procure from 
friends in the War Department the first two flags that had been made with forty-five 
stars-the star of Utah the forty-fifth. Wherever I went, some sinister aspect seemed 
to have gone out of things; and I remember that I enjoyed so much the sense of their 
new inhostility, that I planned to delay my return to Utah until I had made a pilgrimage 
to every spot in Washington where I had despaired of our future.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">All this may seem almost sentimental to you, who perhaps accept 
your citizenship as an unregarded commonplace of natural right. But, for me, the 
freeing of our people was an emancipation to be compared only to the enfranchisement 
of the Southern slaves-and greater even than <i>that</i>, for we had come from citizenship 
in the older states, and we could appreciate our deprivation, smart under our ostracism, 
and resent the rejection that set us apart from the rest of the nation as an inferior 
people unfit for equal rights.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I sat down to my dinner, that evening, with the appetite that 
comes from a day of fasting and emotional excitement; and I recall that I was planning 
a visit of self-congratulation to Arlington, for the morrow, when one of the hotel 
bell-boys brought me a telegram. I opened it eagerly-to enjoy the expected message 
of felicitation from home.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">It was in cipher, and that fact gave me a pause of doubt, since 
the days of political mysteries and their cipher telegrams were over for us, thank 
God! It was signed with President Woodruff&#39;s cipher name.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I went to my room to translate it, and I did not return to my 
dinner. The message read: &quot;It is the will of the Lord that your father shall be 
elected Senator from Utah.&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="left">I do not need to explain all the treacherous implications of 
that announcement. As soon as I had recovered my breath, I wired back, for such 
interpretation as they should choose to give: &quot;God bless Utah. I am coming home,&quot;-and 
packed my trunk, for trouble.</p>
