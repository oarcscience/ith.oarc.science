This is a memoir of Frank J. Cannon (1859-1933). Although born into a
prominent Mormon family, Cannon was a freethinker and a progressive. He
recounts an insiders' view of the painful process by which the Mormon
church and the state of Utah became integrated into the United States.
He played an active role in this history, lobbying for statehood both in
the halls of Washington D.C. and in the inner councils of the Mormon
church. This work is highly critical of the Mormon hierarchy, the
conformist and inward-looking aspects of Mormon society, and of
polygamy. However, he also praises the social programs of the Church.
This is an important source document for the history of the Mormon
people and the state of Utah.
