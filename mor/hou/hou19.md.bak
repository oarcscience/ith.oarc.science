    <span class="smallcaps">Of</span> the twenty-five or thirty thousand
latter-day saints gathered in the valley of the Great Salt Lake at the
close of the year 1852, less than one third came from Nauvoo; nearly
seven thousand proselytes had arrived from various parts of Europe, and
the remainder consisted principally of converts made in the United
States. <span id="fr_562"></span>[1](#fn_562.md) As to the number of those
who

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

had been baptized into the faith in various paris of the world, and were
waiting for means or opportunity to emigrate, there are no reliable
data; but they probably amounted to not less than 150,000, and possibly
to a larger number.

    Thus within little more than twenty years the church of Jesus Christ
of latter-day saints had increased from a handful to an army. And theirs
was a new religion, a new revelation, not an ancient faith; they chose
for their proselytizing efforts civilized rather than savage fields. In
their missionary adventures no sect was ever more devoted, more
self-sacrificing, or more successful. The catholic friars in their
new-world excursions were not more indifferent to life, wealth, health,
and comfort, not more indifferent to scorn and insult, not more filled
with high courage and lofty enthusiasm, than were the Mormon elders in
their old-world enterprises. In all their movements they were
circumspect, moderate, studying the idiosyncrasies of the several
nations in which they labored, and careful about running unnecessarily
counter to their prejudices.

    On reaching the scene of his labors, the missionary earned his daily
bread by some trade or handicraft, not even refusing domestic service,
in order to provide for his wants, and meanwhile studying the language
of the people among whom he lived. Many were cast into dungeons, where
they were forced to live on bread and water; many travelled on foot from
district to district, with no other food than the roots which they dug
near the wayside; many journeyed under the rays of a tropical sun, the
water trickling from the rocks and the berries hanging from the bushes
forming at times their only sustenance. <span
id="fr_563"></span>[2](#fn_563.md)

    The term of their labors had no certain limit, depending entirely on
the will of the first presidency. For the more distant missions it was
seldom less than two years or more than six. They must remain at

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

their post until ordered home; and when recalled, they were often forced
to earn by their own labor the means of crossing seas and deserts.
Restored at length to their families, they were ready to set forth at a
day's notice to new fields of labor; and for all this self-denial they
sought no earthly reward, esteeming it as their greatest privilege thus
to give proof of their unfailing devotion to the church.

    One of the first Mormon missions of which we have any record was
sent forth in October 1830, in which year, as will be remembered, it was
ordered that Pratt, Cowdery, Whitmer, and Peterson should go and preach
the gospel to the Lamanites. During their progress they labored for a
season among the Wyandots in western Ohio. Thence they journeyed to
Cincinnati, but meeting there with little success, proceeded to St
Louis, preaching at several points on their way to large congregations.
Starting forth westward early in the spring, they travelled for 300
miles through the snow, sometimes knee-deep, their food being corn bread
and raw frozen pork. After a journey of 1,500 miles, occupying about
four months, they reached Independence, having preached the gospel to
thousands of the gentiles, baptizing and confirming many hundreds, and
establishing several churches. <span id="fr_564"></span>[3](#fn_564.md)

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

    For twenty-five years Parley labored at intervals as a missionary in
various parts of the Union, <span id="fr_565"></span>[4](#fn_565.md) and in
1845 was appointed president of the churches in New England and the
middle states. During his

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

career he made several thousand proselytes, and wheresoever he set foot,
seldom failed of success.

    "Of all the places in which the English language is spoken," writes
Parley in 1838, "I find the city of New York to be the most difficult as
to access to the minds or attention of the people. From July to January
we preached, advertised, printed, published, <span
id="fr_566"></span>[5](#fn_566.md) testified, visited, talked, prayed, and
wept in vain." Elijah Fordham was with him, and for several weeks only
six proselytes were made, of whom two or three sometimes met in a small
upper room in an obscure street.

    Sorely discouraged, the two elders invited their converts to a last
prayer-meeting, intending to set forth for New Orleans. Each prayed in
turn, when suddenly the room was filled with the holy spirit, and all
began to prophesy and speak in tongues. "They should tarry in the city
and go not thence as yet; for the Lord had many people in that city, and
he had now come by the power of his holy spirit to gather them into his
fold."

    Among the converts was a chairmaker, named David Rogers, who now
fitted up a large chamber at his own expense and invited the elders to
preach. The room was crowded at the first meeting, and soon afterward
the elders were ministering at fifteen different places throughout the
city, all of which were crowded, sometimes preaching twice a day almost
every day in the week, besides visiting from house to house. <span
id="fr_567"></span>[6](#fn_567.md)

    Mention has already been made of the labors of Brigham Young and
other missionaries in various

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

parts of the United States. To relate them in detail for each succeeding
year would more than occupy the space alotted to this volume, and for
further particulars I refer the reader to the note subjoined. <span
id="fr_568"></span>[7](#fn_568.md) It

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

remains only to add that, throughout the Union, the Mormons were less
successful in making proselytes than in some other parts of the world,
especially in Great Britain and northern Europe.

 

    In the year 1833, Orson Pratt was sent as a missionary to southern
Canada, and <span id="fr_569"></span>[8](#fn_569.md) about the same date
Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon organized a church near Hamilton. In
1836, Parley Pratt, brother to Orson, being then one of the twelve, was
sent to Upper Canada <span id="fr_570"></span>[9](#fn_570.md) to preach and
establish a church; and from this ministry it was foretold that the
gospel should spread into England. With him went Brother Nickerson, who
parted company at Hamilton. Left alone, knowing no one, having no money,
what should he do? His destination was Toronto; fare by steamer two
dollars; it would be a tedious journey on foot. He entered his closet
and prayed to the Lord, then stepped out upon the street and began
chatting with the people. Presently he was accosted by a stranger who
asked his name, and whither he was going, and if he did not want money.
Parley answered, explaining his position, whereupon the stranger gave
him ten dollars, and a letter of introduction to John Taylor, a merchant
of Toronto, where he arrived the same day. He was kindly received by Mr
and Mrs

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Taylor, but they
could give him no direct encouragement; he took tea with them, and then
sought lodgings at a public house. In the morning he visited the
clergymen of the place, none of whom would open to him their dwellings
or places of worship. Then he applied to the sheriff for the use of the
court-house, then to the authorities for a public room in the
market-place, and with no better result. The prospect was dark,
considering the prophecies concerning this mission. Again and again he
tried with no better success. His resources were exhausted; he could do
nothing more; he must depart.

    He retired to a grove just outside the town and prayed. His heart
was very heavy. He returned to the house of John Taylor, where he had
left his handful of baggage, and bade his friends farewell. Mr Taylor
was touched with pity, and held him for a moment in conversation, during
which a Mrs Walton entered and began talking in an adjoining room with
Mrs Taylor, who spoke of Parley's failure, saying: "He may be a man of
God, and I am sorry to have him depart." The visitor was at once deeply
interested. "Indeed," she said, "I feel that it is so, and that I was
directed hither by the spirit of the Lord. I am a widow; but I have a
spare room and bed, and food in plenty. My son will come and guide him
to my house, which shall be his home; and there are two large rooms to
preach in." Parley gladly accepted the offer. His labors were
thenceforth attended with success. Mrs Walton soon received baptism; a
friend of hers, a poor widow, was miraculously cured of blindness, and
many in consequence believed.

    There was a Mr Patrick, a wealthy and influential man, whose custom
it was every sabbath to hold in his house a meeting, wherein were
discussed questions concerning salvation, without regard to doctrine or
dogma. Both John Taylor and Mrs Walton were in the habit of attending
these meetings, the former frequently taking a part in the discussions.
On one occasion

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Parley attended,
and was invited to speak, but declined, preferring to give a special
call, which he did. At the appointed hour the rooms were filled; at the
close of a powerful discourse another meeting was called for, and then
another. Taylor became more and more interested; he once accompanied
Parley into the country where he had promised to preach; at length, with
Mrs Taylor, he was baptized. Thus was a shining light brought into the
church, a branch of which was now established in Toronto, and was the
forerunner of the mission work in Great Britain. <span
id="fr_571"></span>[10](#fn_571.md)

    During the year 1837, Heber C. Kimball and Orson Hyde, of the quorum
of the twelve, accompanied by Willard Richards, were placed at the head
of a mission to England, the members of which were drawn from elders of
the church in Canada, and several of whom were English, or had friends
in England. The elders chosen were Joseph Fielding, Isaac Russell, John
Goodson, and John Snider. <span id="fr_572"></span>[11](#fn_572.md) Taking
ship for Liverpool, where they arrived on the 20th of July, <span
id="fr_573"></span>[12](#fn_573.md) apostles Kimball, Hyde, and Willard
Richards landed without the means of paying for their first night's
lodging; but the remainder of the party furnishing the funds, all
secured apartments in the same dwelling, and two days later took coach
for Preston. Here at Vauxhall Chapel, then in charge of the Rev. James
Fielding, brother to Elder Fielding, the doctrines of Mormonism were
first proclaimed in Great Britain, Kimball giving a brief account of the
origin of the church, and of the teachings of the book of Mormon.

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

    The work prospered, and within a few months about 1,500 converts
were made, <span id="fr_574"></span>[13](#fn_574.md) not only at Preston,
but also at Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, and as we shall see later, in
Glasgow and in the south of Wales. In April 1840, when was held, at
Preston, the first council of the twelve in a foreign land, Brigham
Young, who arrived in England during this year, <span
id="fr_575"></span>[14](#fn_575.md) being elected their president, the
church claimed in the British Islands nearly 2,000 proselytes, <span
id="fr_576"></span>[15](#fn_576.md) in April 1841 more than 6,000, <span
id="fr_577"></span>[16](#fn_577.md) and at the close of 1852 more than
32,000. According to a statistical report of the church throughout the
United Kingdom for the half-year ending December 31, 1852, there were at
that date 742 branches, 17 of the quorum of seventies, 10 high-priests,
1,913 priests, 2,752 elders, 1,446 teachers, and 856

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

deacons. <span id="fr_578"></span>[17](#fn_578.md) It is worthy of note
that the number of members at this date was about the same as is stated
in the report dated June 1, 1851, <span id="fr_579"></span>[18](#fn_579.md)
no interval of this length having previously occurred during which the
number of proselytes was not largely increased. Meanwhile, however, the
number of branches had increased by 100, and during the last half of the
year 1852 more than 2,000 members had emigrated.

    Manchester conference, with its starved factory operatives, heads
the list with 3,282 members, and those who have visited any of the great
manufacturing towns of Lancashire, where in winter men, women, and
children may be seen hastening from their ill-drained hovels through the
snow and slush of the dark streets to the cotton-mill, returning
exhausted with toil to their supper of bread and tea, will not wonder
that these hapless human beings were glad to exchange their hard lot for
the plenty of the promised land. In London the number of proselytes was
2,464, in Birmingham 1,883, in Norwich 1,061, and in Liverpool 1,041. In
no other town or city does the number amount to one thousand, though
most of the shires of England are represented in the list of branches.

    At this period the British Islands were justly termed the stronghold
of Mormonism; and that Mormon missionaries made in that country a deep
and abiding impression is shown by the fact that their 32,000
proselytes, nearly all of them being mechanics, laborers, or factory
operatives, expended of their scant earnings nearly one dollar per
capita a year for the purchase of Mormon books, periodicals, and
insignia. <span id="fr_580"></span>[19](#fn_580.md)

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In later-years a
strong reaction set in, the members of the church at the close of 1878
mustering only 2,904, the number of branches having decreased to

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 98, of priests to
182, of elders to 521, of teachers to 105; and of deacons to 128. <span
id="fr_581"></span>[20](#fn_581.md)

    In Wales and Scotland the Mormons were at first no less successful,
the number of proselytes at the close of 1852 being in the former
country nearly 5,000, <span id="fr_582"></span>[21](#fn_582.md) and in the
latter more than 3,000; <span id="fr_583"></span>[22](#fn_583.md) but in
these countries also a reaction occurred, the number of Welsh members at
the close of 1878 having fallen to 325 and of Scotch to 351. <span
id="fr_584"></span>[23](#fn_584.md) In Ireland, as in other catholic
countries, their missionaries were regarded with little favor, the
converts mustering in 1852 only 245, though between 1846 and 1852
Ireland was passing through the years of her sorest tribulation, and
those of her people who accepted Mormonism

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

had an opportunity, as we shall see later, of improving their
condition. <span id="fr_585"></span>[24](#fn_585.md)

    In British India, <span id="fr_586"></span>[25](#fn_586.md) Ceylon,
British Guiana, at the cape of Good Hope, in the West Indies, <span
id="fr_587"></span>[26](#fn_587.md) in Australia, Tasmania, New
Zealand, <span id="fr_588"></span>[27](#fn_588.md) Malta, and Gibraltar,
there were also branches of the church, though in none of the British
colonies were the missionaries received so cordially as in the mother
country.

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

    In France and Germany few proselytes were made. In the former
country there were, in June 1850, branches of the church at Paris,
Boulogne, Calais, and Havre; but the total number of members was
probably little more than a hundred. <span
id="fr_589"></span>[28](#fn_589.md) In Germany the Mormons were even less
successful. In 1853 Elder Carn, who, two years before, had been
imprisoned and afterward expelled from the confederation for preaching
Mormonism, applied at Berlin for permission to hold meetings. The answer
was that he must leave the city immediately under pain of
transportation. <span id="fr_590"></span>[29](#fn_590.md) In Holland, <span
id="fr_591"></span>[30](#fn_591.md) Denmark, <span
id="fr_592"></span>[31](#fn_592.md) Scandinavia, <span
id="fr_593"></span>[32](#fn_593.md)

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Iceland, <span
id="fr_594"></span>[33](#fn_594.md) where was published *The Voice of
Joseph*, <span id="fr_595"></span>[34](#fn_595.md) in Italy,
Switzerland, <span id="fr_596"></span>[35](#fn_596.md) in Mexico, <span
id="fr_597"></span>[36](#fn_597.md) in Chili, in China, in Siam, <span
id="fr_598"></span>[37](#fn_598.md) in the Sandwich and Society
islands, <span id="fr_599"></span>[38](#fn_599.md)

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

and even in Jerusalem, was the Mormon gospel preached. <span
id="fr_600"></span>[39](#fn_600.md)

 

    It may be stated in general terms that the success of Mormon
evangelism has been the most pronounced in countries where the climate
is harsh, where wages are low, and the conditions of life severe, where
there is freedom of conscience, and where there is a large class of
illiterate men and women, prone to superstition and fanaticism.
Elsewhere no lasting impression has been made. Thus for many years the
stronghold of Mormonism was, as we have seen, in England, while in the
British colonies, where for the most part food is cheap, labor is in
demand at living rates, and the people are somewhat more enlightened
than in the mother country, missionaries have met with little
encouragement. In Norway, Sweden, and Denmark large numbers of
proselytes have also been baptized; but in central and southern Europe,
with the exception perhaps of Switzerland, the results have been meagre,
and accomplished with great effort. The Scandinavian and British
missions, the former including Denmark, claimed, at the close of 1878,
nearly 8,000 members of the church; <span
id="fr_601"></span>[40](#fn_601.md) and it is probable that in other parts
of Europe there could not be

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

found more than 2,000 or 3,000 additional members. If to these figures
be added 15,000 converts distributed throughout the United States, 4,000
in British America, 3,000 in the Sandwich and Society islands, and
perhaps 2,000 elsewhere in the world, we have a total of 35,000
latter-day saints scattered among the gentiles; and estimating the
population of Utah at 140,000, a total of 175,000 professing the Mormon
faith. <span id="fr_602"></span>[41](#fn_602.md)

    Of the present population of Utah, about one third are of foreign
birth, and at least another third of foreign parentage, converts having
been gathered to Zion as speedily as the means could be furnished, from
the earliest days of Mormon evangelism.

    Between 1837 and 1851 about 17,000 proselytes set sail from
England, <span id="fr_603"></span>[42](#fn_603.md) among them a
considerable percentage belonging to other nationalities. In the latter
year, not more than 3,000 persons arrived in the valley of the Great
Salt Lake, including converts from the United States; although at this
time it was published in American and copied in European papers that
proselytes by the hundred thousand were on their way. In 1852
immigration was on a somewhat larger scale. <span
id="fr_604"></span>[43](#fn_604.md) During a single month 352 converts

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

took ship from Liverpool, of whom 108 were laborers, the remainder being
farmers, joiners, shoemakers, rope-makers, watch-makers, engine-makers,
weavers, tailors, masons, butchers, bakers, painters, potters, dyers,
iron-moulders, glass-cutters, nail-makers, basket-makers, sawyers,
gun-makers, saddlers, miners, smiths, and shipwrights. <span
id="fr_605"></span>[44](#fn_605.md) Of the total emigration between 1850
and 1854, it was estimated that 28 per cent were laborers, 14 per cent
miners, and about 27 per cent mechanics, among every two hundred being
found one domestic servant, a shepherd, and a printer, and among every
five hundred a schoolmaster, with here and there a university graduate,
usually of no occupation, a dancing-master, a doctor, a dentist, and a
retired or cashiered army officer. <span
id="fr_606"></span>[45](#fn_606.md) For each emigrant as he arrived was
apportioned an allotment of ground, and thus all became landed
proprietors; though few brought with them capital, save the ability to
labor, and many had not the means wherewith to pay for their passage.

 

    On October 6, 1849, was organized at Salt Lake City the Perpetual
Emigration Fund Company, for the purpose of aiding the poor to remove
from Europe and the United States. <span
id="fr_607"></span>[46](#fn_607.md) The company has continued

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

in operation for nearly forty years, and through it fifty thousand
persons have been assisted in removing to Utah. "The fund was gotten
up," says Woodruff, "on the principle of perpetual succession, to
continue increasing on condition of the people acting honestly, and in
accordance with their covenants repaying the amounts…which had been
advanced. <span id="fr_608"></span>[47](#fn_608.md) The sum thus loaned was
usually refunded as soon as possible, for this obligation was held
sacred by most of the saints, some working out their indebtedness at the
public ateliers of the tithing office, and receiving meanwhile half the
value of their labor, besides being supplied with food. There were many,
however, who neglected or were unable to pay the advance, the amount due
to the funds increasing gradually, until, in 1880, it had reached, with
interest, $1,604,000. At the jubilee conference, held in April of this
year, one half of the debt was remitted in favor of the most worthy and
needy of the assisted emigrants. <span id="fr_609"></span>[48](#fn_609.md)

 

    On the 1st of May, 1852, Samuel W. Richards was placed in charge of
the British mission, and on September 30th was appointed agent of the
emigration company. During this and the following year emigration
parties were organized with better system, and the benefits of the fund
extended to larger numbers than during any previous period. On July 17,
1852, was published in the *Millennial Star* the seventh general epistle
of the twelve. "Finally, brethren, fear God;

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

work righteousness, and come home speedily. Prepare against another
season to come by tens of thousands; and think not that your way is
going to be opened to come in chariots, feasting on the fat of all
lands. We have been willing to live on bread and water, and many times
very little bread too, for years, that we might search out and plant the
saints in a goodly land. This we have accomplished, through the blessing
of our heavenly father; and we now invite you to a feast of fat things,
to a land that will supply all your wants with reasonable labor;
therefore let all who can procure a bit of bread, and one garment on
their back, be assured there is water plenty and pure by the way, and
doubt no longer, but come next year to the place of gathering, and even
in flocks, as doves fly to their windows before a storm."

    These words were repeated by hundreds of elders throughout the
United Kingdom, and no second invitation was needed. Men offered
themselves by thousands, begging for passage to the land of the saints,
promising to walk the entire way from St Louis to Salt Lake City, and to
assist in hauling the provisions and baggage. To meet this demand, it
was determined to despatch emigrants for the ensuing season at the low
rate of £10 sterling per capita for the entire journey, <span
id="fr_610"></span>[49](#fn_610.md) including provisions, and nearly one
thousand persons availed themselves of the opportunity. There were now
four classes of emigrants: first, those assisted from the fund by order
from Salt Lake City; second, assisted emigrants selected in Great
Britain; third, the £10 emigrants; fourth, emigrants who paid all their
own expenses and sent forward money to procure teams. <span
id="fr_611"></span>[50](#fn_611.md) The entire outlay

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

for the season's emigration was not less than £30,000. A year or two
later it was found necessary to increase the minimum charge from £10 to
£13, on account of the greater cost of provisions, wagons, and cattle,
caused by the California emigration.

    Of emigrant travel by sea and land we have interesting records.
Excepting perhaps some parts of Soudan, there were, at this date, few
places in the world more difficult to reach than the valley of the Great
Salt Lake. After arriving at New Orleans, a journey of more than three
thousand miles awaited the emigrants by way of St Louis and Council
Bluffs, from which latter point they must proceed in wagons or on foot
across the wilderness, travelling in this primitive fashion for three
weary months before reaching their destination. Of all the thousands who
set forth on this toilsome pilgrimage, few failed to reach the city of
the saints, the loss of life, whether of man or beast, being very much
below that which was suffered by parties bound for the gold-fields of
California. While at sea, every provision was made for their health and
comfort, and after reaching Council Bluffs none were allowed to start
until their outfit was complete and their party fully organized.

    The Liverpool manager of one of the New Orleans packet lines speaks
in the highest terms of his intercourse with the Mormons during the year
1850. He states that they were generally intelligent and well behaved,
and many of them highly respectable. After mentioning the vocations of
the emigrants, he declares that the precautions taken for the
preservation of order, decency, and cleanliness on board were admirable,
and well worthy of imitation; and that from his observation of the
slovenly and dirty habits of other classes of emigrants, it would not
only conduce to their comfort and health, but would absolutely save the
lives of many if similar regulations were introduced. <span
id="fr_612"></span>[51](#fn_612.md)

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>

    The Mormons objected to take passage in ships which carried other
emigrants; or, if they embarked in such vessels, it was always arranged
that a partition should be built to separate them from the gentiles. The
dietary was on a scale <span id="fr_613"></span>[52](#fn_613.md) that gave
to most of them better fare than that to which they had before been
accustomed. Many of the vessels chartered for New Orleans were of large
tonnage, some of them carrying as many as a thousand passengers. When on
board, the brethren were divided into wards, each with its bishop and
two councillors, who were implicitly obeyed. The centre of the ship was
occupied by married couples, single men being placed in the bow and
single women in the stern. Strict discipline was enforced on the
voyage. <span id="fr_614"></span>[53](#fn_614.md) Divine service was held
each day, morning and evening, when the weather was favorable, and on
Sundays an awning was spread over the main deck, and spare spars so
arranged as to furnish seats. Among many of the companies were excellent
choirs, which rendered the church music; and during the passage there
were frequent entertainments, concerts, and dance-parties, in which the
captain and officers of the ship participated.

    After landing, the same organization was maintained. Remaining for a
few days at New Orleans, the emigrants were conveyed in companies by
steamer to St Louis, and thence proceeded to Council Bluffs. <span
id="fr_615"></span>[54](#fn_615.md) Here

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

they rested for a time to recruit themselves and their cattle, and those
who were without funds worked for the means wherewith to continue their
journey, or waited until supplied with money from the emigration fund.

    When the brethren were ready to set forth for Salt Lake City, they
were divided into companies of ten, fifty, and a hundred, and the order
of march was the same as that adopted in 1848, during the migration from
Nauvoo. For every party of ten, a wagon, two oxen, two milch cows, and a
tent were provided. Each wagon was examined by one of the bishops, and
none were allowed to start that did not contain the requisite quantity
of provisions <span id="fr_616"></span>[55](#fn_616.md) and ammunition. All
who were capable of bearing arms were required to carry a rifle or
musket. Any surplus means that the members might possess was invested in
breadstuffs, groceries, dry goods, clothing, cattle, seeds, or
implements.

    Of the journey of the emigrant trains from Council Bluffs to the
city of the saints, little remains to be said, as mention of this matter
has been made in a previous chapter. To each emigrant as he travelled
his wagon served for bedroom, parlor, and kitchen, and sometimes even as
a boat in which to convey his effects over river or swamp. The average
day's journey did not exceed thirteen miles, though the trains were in
motion almost from sunrise until even-fall, a halt being made for the
mid-day meal, and in order to give the cattle time to graze. Many of the
caravans consisted of several hundred wagons, some of them drawn by six
or eight oxen, and with every company went large bands of
live-stock. <span id="fr_617"></span>[56](#fn_617.md) The procession, as it
moved

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

slowly along with its endless train of vehicles and its hundreds of
cattle, sheep, horses, and mules, formed a picturesque and motley
spectacle. Among the members of the party were to be found the New
England man with his stock of trading goods, the southerner with his
colored attendant, the Englishman with his box of mechanic's tools, the
Dane, the Swiss, and the Scandinavian with their implements of
agriculture. There were few trades and few nationalities not
represented, and few professions save that of the lawyer. Among the
proselytes were university graduates, physicians, ministers, army and
navy officers, school-masters, merchants, storekeepers, and even
pawnbrokers. Yet amidst all this heterogeneous gathering, throughout all
the hardships and privations of the march, there was little strife or
discord; and never did it happen, as was often the case with parties
bound for the gold-fields, that a Mormon company broke up into fragments
through the dissension of its members. <span
id="fr_618"></span>[57](#fn_618.md)

    Those who set forth early in the season—not later than the middle of
June—seldom met with any serious disaster; and it was recommended that
none should leave Council Bluffs after that time of year, on account of
the severe snow-storms that sometimes prevailed in the mountains during
autumn. In October 1849, for instance, while crossing Rocky Ridge, near
the summit of South Pass, a party in charge of George A. Smith, the
prophet's cousin, encountered a storm, in which more than sixty of their
cattle perished. Toward night on the 2d a strong wind set in from the
north-east, accompanied with driving snow. The company encamped on a
branch of the Sweetwater,

<span id="page_422">p. 422</span>

driving their cattle into a willow copse near by, as to build a corral
was impossible. The wind freshened into a gale, and then into a
hurricane, howling incessantly for thirty-six hours, and drifting the
snow in every direction. For two nights women and children lay under
their frail covering, exposed to the blast, with no food but a morsel of
bread or biscuit. Tents and wagon-tops were blown away, and the wagons
buried almost to the tops of their wheels in the snow-drifts. No fires
could be lighted; little food could be had; no aid was nigh; and now, in
this wintry solitude, though within a few days' march of the valley, the
saints expected no other fate than to leave their bodies a prey to the
wolves and the vultures.

    At length the storm abated, and making their way toward the willow
copse, the men found nearly half their cattle lying stiff amid the
snow-banks, while others died from the effects of the storm. Not a human
life was lost, however, though in this neighborhood many a grave was
passed, some of friends near and dear, some of gold-seekers, whose
bodies had been disinterred and half devoured by the wolves, and some of
their persecutors in Illinois and Missouri, whose bones lay bleaching in
the sun, a head-board with name, age, and date of decease being all that
remained to mark their resting-place. <span
id="fr_619"></span>[58](#fn_619.md)

 

    Until the year 1856 the poorer classes of emigrants were supplied
with ox-teams for the overland portion of the trip, the total cost of
the journey from Liverpool, including provisions, never exceeding sixty
dollars. There were thousands of converts in Europe, however,

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

who were anxious to be gathered unto Zion, but could not command even
this sum, and measures were now considered whereby the expense could be
reduced. After much discussion, it was decided that parties should cross
the plains with hand-carts, in which they were to carry their baggage,
wagons being provided only for tents, extra provisions, and those who
were unable to walk. Instructions to this effect were issued from
Brigham Young, September 30, 1855, and in a general epistle of the
twelve, dated October 29th, a circular being published in Liverpool
about four months later by the presidency of the British Isles, in which
the rate of passage was fixed at £9 sterling per capita. <span
id="fr_620"></span>[59](#fn_620.md) "The Lord, through his prophet, says of
the poor, 'Let them come on foot, with hand-carts or wheelbarrows; let
them gird up their loins, and walk through, and nothing shall hinder
them.'"

    Iowa City was selected as the point of outfit, and there the
hand-carts were built. They were of somewhat primitive fashion, the
shafts being about five feet long and of hickory or oak, with
cross-pieces, one of them serving for handle, forming the bed of the
cart, under the centre of which was a wooden axle-tree, the wheels being
also of wood, with a light iron band, and the entire weight of the
vehicle about sixty pounds. <span id="fr_621"></span>[60](#fn_621.md)
Better carts were provided in subsequent years. When the hand-cart
emigrants, about thirteen hundred in number, set forth from Liverpool,
they were assured that everything would be provided for them on their
arrival at Iowa City; but on reaching that point many of them were
delayed for weeks until the carts were built. Three companies started
early in the season and made the journey without mishap. <span
id="fr_622"></span>[61](#fn_622.md) The next company, under Captain James
G. Willie,

<span id="page_424">p. 424</span>

was not in motion until the middle of July, and the last that season,
under Captain Edward Martin, not until the end of that month. They were
divided, as usual, into hundreds, Willie's company being somewhat below
that number; and for each hundred were furnished twenty hand-carts, five
tents, three or four milch cows, and a wagon with three yoke of oxen to
convey the provisions and tents, the quantity of clothing and bedding
being limited to seventeen pounds per capita, and the freight of each
cart, including cooking utensils, being about one hundred pounds.

    Willie's company reached Winter Quarters, or Florence, as it was now
termed, near the middle of August, and here a meeting was held to decide
whether they should continue their journey or encamp for the winter.
They had yet more than a thousand miles to travel, and with their utmost
effort could not expect to arrive in the valley until late in November.
The matter was left with the elders, all of whom, except one named Levi
Savage, counselled them to go forward and trust in the Lord, who would
surely protect his people. Savage declared that they should trust also
to such common sense as the Lord had given them. From his certain
knowledge, the company, containing as it did so large a number of the
aged and infirm, of women and children, could not cross the mountains
thus late in the season, without much suffering, sickness, and death. He
was overruled and rebuked for want of faith. "Brethren and sisters," he
replied, "what I have said I know to be true; but seeing you are to go
forward, I will go with you. May God in his mercy preserve us."

    The company set forth from Florence on the 18th, and on each
hand-cart was now placed a ninety-eight-pound sack of flour, as the
wagons could not carry the entire load. At first they travelled about
fifteen miles a day, although delays were caused by the breaking of
wheels and axles, the heat and aridity of the plains and mountain
country speedily making many of the cart-wheels rickety, and unable to
sustain their

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

burdens without frequent repairs. Some shod the axles of their carts
with old leather, others with tin from the plates and kettles of their
mess outfit; and for grease they used their allowance of bacon, and even
their soap, of which they had but little. On reaching Wood River, the
cattle stampeded, <span id="fr_623"></span>[62](#fn_623.md) and thirty head
were lost, the remainder being only sufficient to allow one yoke to each
wagon. The beef cattle, milk cows, and heifers were used as draught
animals, but were of little service, and it was found necessary to place
another sack of flour on each hand-cart. The issue of beef was then
stopped, the cows gave no milk, and the daily ration was reduced to a
pound of flour, with a little rice, sugar, coffee, and bacon, an
allowance which only furnished breakfast for some of the men, who fasted
for the remainder of the day.

    While encamped on the north fork of the Platte, the emigrants were
overtaken by F. D. Richards, W. H. Kimball, G. D. Grant, and a party of
elders, returning from foreign missions, who gave them what
encouragement they could. "Though it might storm on their right and on
their left, the Lord would keep open their way before them, and they
would reach Zion in safety." After camping with them for one night, the
elders went on their way, promising to leave provisions for them at Fort
Laramie if possible, and to send aid from Salt Lake City. On reaching
Laramie no provisions were found, and rations were again reduced, men
able to work receiving twelve ounces of flour daily, women and old men
nine ounces, and children from four to eight ounces.

    As the emigrants travelled along the banks of the Sweetwater, the
nights became severe, and their bed-covering was now insufficient.
Before them were the mountains, clad almost to the base with snow, where
already the storms of winter were gathering. Gradually the old and
infirm began to droop, and soon deaths became frequent, the companies
seldom leaving

<span id="page_426">p. 426</span>

their camping-ground without burying one or more of the party. Then
able-bodied men began to succumb, a few of them continuing to pull their
carts until the day before they died, and one or two even on the day of
their death. On the morning when the first snowstorm occurred, the last
ration of flour was issued, and a march of sixteen miles was before them
to the nearest camping-ground on the Sweetwater. The task seemed
hopeless; but at noon a wagon drove up, containing Joseph A. Young and
Stephen Taylor, from Salt Lake City, who told them that a train of
supplies was on the way, and would reach them in a day or two. Young and
Taylor immediately went on to meet Martin's company, which it was feared
was even in worse plight than that of Captain Willie. Thus encouraged,
the emigrants pushed forward, and by doubling their teams, while the
strongest of the party helped the weak to drag along their carts, all
reached the camping-ground, though some of the cattle perished, and
during the night five persons died of cold and exhaustion.

    In the morning the snow was a foot deep; and now there remained only
two barrels of biscuit, a few pounds of sugar and dried apples, and a
quarter of a sack of rice. Two of the disabled cattle were killed, their
carcasses issued for beef, and on this and a small dole of biscuit the
emigrants were told that they must subsist until supplies reached them,
the small remnant of provisions being reserved for the young children
and the sick. It was now decided to remain in camp, while Captain Willie
with one of the elders went in search of the supply trains. The small
allowance of beef and biscuit was consumed the first day, and on the
second day more cattle were killed and eaten without biscuit. On the
next day there was nothing to eat, for no more cattle could be spared,
and still the supplies came not, being delayed by the same storm which
the emigrants had encountered. During these three

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

days many died and numbers sickened, some expiring in the arms of those
who were themselves almost at the point of death, mothers clasping with
their dying clutch the remnants of their tattered clothing around the
wan forms of their perishing infants, and, most pitiful sight of all,
strong men begging for the morsel of food that had been set apart for
the sick and helpless.

    It was now the evening of the third day, and the sun was sinking
behind the snow-clad ranges, which could be traced far to the west amid
the clear, frosty atmosphere of the desert. There were many who, while
they gazed on this scene, did not expect to see the light of another
day, and there were many who cared no longer for life, having lost all
that makes life precious. They retired to their tents, and commending
themselves to their maker, lay down to rest, perchance to die. But
presently a shout of joy was raised, as from an eminence near the
western portion of the camp covered wagons were seen approaching, with
Willie at their head. In charge of the train were Kimball and Grant, who
distributed to the companies about half of their provisions, together
with a quantity of warm clothing, blankets, and buffalo-robes, the
remainder being sent forward under charge of Grant for the use of
Martin's company, while Kimball now took command of Willie's detachment.

    But the troubles of the hand-cart emigrants were not yet at an end.
Some were already beyond all human aid; some had lost their reason, and
around others the blackness of despair had gathered, all efforts to
rouse them from their stupor being unavailing. Each day the weather grew
colder, and many were frost-bitten, losing fingers, toes, or ears, one
sick man who held on to the wagon-bars, to avoid jolting, having all his
fingers frozen. At a camping-ground on Willow Creek, a tributary of the
Sweetwater, fifteen corpses were buried, thirteen of them being

<span id="page_428">p. 428</span>

frozen to death. Near South Pass another company of the brethren met
them, with supplies from Salt Lake City, and from the trees near their
camp several quarters of fat beef were suspended—"a picture," says
Chislett, who had charge of one of the companies, "that far surpassed
the paintings of the ancient masters." From this point warmer weather
prevailed, and fresh teams from the valley constantly met them,
distributing provisions sufficient for their needs, and then travelling
eastward to meet Martin's company.

    On reaching Salt Lake City on the 9th of November, it was found that
sixty-seven out of a total of four hundred and twenty had died on the
journey. Of the six hundred emigrants included in Martin's detachment,
which arrived three weeks later, a small percentage perished, the storm
which overtook Willie's party on the Sweetwater reaching them on the
North Platte. There they encamped, and waited about ten days for the
weather to moderate. Their rations were reduced to four ounces of flour
per head per day, for a few days, until relief came. On arriving at Salt
Lake, the survivors were received with the utmost kindness, arrangements
being made with the bishops of wards to provide for those who had no
relatives in the territory; and throughout the settlements, wherever it
was known that a family had crossed the plains with the hand-cart
companies, that alone was sufficient to insure for them substantial aid
from the brethren. <span id="fr_624"></span>[63](#fn_624.md)

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span>

    There remains yet one more incident in the story of the hand-cart
emigration. On arrival at Devil's Gate on the Sweetwater, twenty men,
belonging to Martin's company, were left in charge of stock,
merchandise, and baggage, with orders to follow in the spring. The snow
fell deep, and many of the cattle were devoured by the wolves, while
others perished from cold. The rest were slaughtered, and on their
frozen carcasses the men subsisted, their small stock of flour and salt
being now exhausted. Game was scarce in the neighborhood, and with their
utmost care the supply of food could not hold out until spring. Two of
the men, with the only horses that remained, were sent to Platte Bridge
to obtain supplies; but the animals were lost, and they returned
empty-handed. Presently the meat was all consumed; and then their only
resource was the hides, which were cut into small pieces and soaked in
hot water, after the hair had been removed. When the last hides had been
eaten, nothing remained but their boot-tops and the scraps of leather
around their wagons, even the neck-piece of a buffalo skin which had
served as door-mat being used for food. Thus they kept themselves alive
until spring, when they subsisted on thistle roots and wild garlic,
until at length relief came from Salt Lake City.

    Even the worst enemies of Brigham Young admit that he was in no
sense to blame for this disaster, and that he spared no effort to
prevent it. When tidings of the emigrants’ condition arrived in Salt
Lake City, he at once suspended all other business, <span
id="fr_625"></span>[64](#fn_625.md) and declared that nothing more should
be done until every available team was sent to their relief. He himself
set

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

the example by sending several of his best teams laden with provisions
and clothing, other large supplies being forwarded by Heber C. Kimball
and the more wealthy of the elders. Each one contributed according to
his means, those who had no teams furnishing apparel, bedding, and food,
and this at a time when, as will presently appear, the territory was
almost in a state of famine, on account of a second plague of
grasshoppers.

    The catastrophe was due mainly to the error in starting so late in
the season from Iowa City, and to the fact that the companies did not
contain a sufficient number of able-bodied men in proportion to the
infirm, the women, and children. <span id="fr_626"></span>[65](#fn_626.md)
Moreover, the winter was one of the earliest and most severe that has
ever been known in Utah. The hand-cart scheme was perfectly feasible, if
carried out under proper management, as was proved by the success of the
first companies, and, in the spring of 1857, by a party of seventy-four
missionaries, who accomplished the trip to the Missouri in forty-eight
days, or less than half the time needed when the journey was made by
wagon. <span id="fr_627"></span>[66](#fn_627.md)

    After the hand-cart disaster, and perhaps partly on account of the
reports sent home by the survivors, there was a gradual diminution in
the rate of emigration, though with many fluctuations. In 1876 only
1,184 proselytes were despatched from Liverpool, this being one of the
smallest movements recorded. In 1877 the number increased to 1,479, and
in 1878 to 1,864, but in 1879 fell off to 1,456, about 55 per cent of
the emigrants for the last of these years being of

<span id="page_431">p. 431</span>

British nationality, and 35 per cent Swedish, Norwegian, and
Danish. <span id="fr_628"></span>[67](#fn_628.md) In the church records,
the total emigration from foreign countries, between 1840 and 1883, is
stated at 78,219 souls, or an average of nearly 2,000 a year, the
proselytes taking passage in companies of from 12 to 800 in 243
different vessels, all of which reached their destination in
safety. <span id="fr_629"></span>[68](#fn_629.md) Probably the main cause
of the decrease in emigration during later years was the advance in the
rate of fare, which in 1878 was fixed at £14-14, a sum for which passage
could be secured to almost any portion of the world.

    Between 1850 and 1856 the movement appears to have reached its
culmination, proselytes being gathered by the thousand to the promised
land, and thousands more preparing to follow. The elders were exhorted
to "thunder the word of the almighty to the saints to arise and come to
Zion." <span id="fr_630"></span>[69](#fn_630.md) The brethren were
commanded to shake from their feet the dust of Babylon and hasten to the
holy city. "Every saint who does not come home," says the sixth general
epistle of the twelve, <span id="fr_631"></span>[70](#fn_631.md) "will be
afflicted by the devil." "Every particle of our means that we use in
Babylon," remarks Elder Erastus Snow, <span
id="fr_632"></span>[71](#fn_632.md) "is a loss to ourselves; and it is so
much means expended upon Babylon that shall perish." "O ye poor and
oppressed saints!" writes Elder Samuel Richards, "and ye rich ones too,
in these lands, do not your bosoms burn with the good spirit of God,
which fills his saints always with a desire to congregate together, and
become a holy and

<span id="page_432">p. 432</span>

peculiar people? Do you not long to gather to your brethren and sisters
in the heights of Zion, where sinners cannot dwell? Do you not fondly
wish to assemble with the elders of Israel in the sacred resting-places
of the excellent of the earth, and there inherit the earth and enjoy the
bountiful blessings of a munificent creator?"

    Such sayings, freely circulated among the toiling myriads of Europe,
where for twelve and fifteen hours a day men worked for a wage barely
sufficient to supply their needs, were not without effect. Under such
conditions, a new religion, which promised to exchange the penury and
drudgery of its converts for plenty and moderate labor, could not fail
to receive a hearing. Moreover, the story of the prophet's assassination
and of the expulsion from Illinois was yet fresh in the minds of the
people. The saints were still looked upon as martyrs, and as martyrs
who, having boldly launched forth into an untrodden wilderness, had at
length established for themselves an abiding-place, and now stretched
forth the hand of christian fellowship to the weary and heavy-laden in
all the earth. Never since the founding of the sect was their cause held
in more esteem; never had they dwelt together in more perfect harmony,
less disturbed by outside influences, or less mindful of the events that
were transpiring in the great world beyond. The years that had elapsed
since their departure from Nauvoo had witnessed the rise and fall of an
empire, the crash of a throne, the great revolutions in the world of
science and the world of commerce. But, except so far as they seemed to
fulfil the predictions of their seer, all these matters concerned them
less than did the building of a sawmill or a nail-factory in the land of
which their prophet had foretold: "And they who are in the north
countries shall come in remembrance before the Lord,…and a highway shall
be made in the midst of the great deep,…and in the barren deserts there
shall

<span id="page_433">p. 433</span>

come forth pools of living water; and the parched ground shall no longer
be a thirsty land." <span id="fr_633"></span>[72](#fn_633.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_562"></span>[397:1](hou19.htm#fr_562.md) The pioneer band
included, as we have seen, 143 members. Parley Pratt's companies, which
arrived in Sept. 1847, mustered 1,540. In August 1848 the inhabitants at
Salt Lake City were estimated at nearly 1,800, and there were at this
date no other settlements with any considerable population. The
emigrants from Winter Quarters during the autumn of this year numbered
2,393, and in 1849, 1,400. Smaller bands arrived from time to time, but
with the close of the latter year the migration from Nauvoo practically
came to an end. The number of Mormons from Nauvoo gathered in the valley
at this date may be roughly estimated at not more than 8,000, for there
were still large numbers scattered throughout the western states.
According to the statistics of emigration from Great Britain and Europe,
in *Linforth's Route from Liverpool*, 14-15, 2,877 proselytes left the
United Kingdom between 1846 and 1849. This would make a total of 10,877.
As the reader will remember, the entire population is stated at 11,380
in the *U.S. Census Rept* of 1850. Add to this number 3,714 emigrants
who arrived from Great Britain and Europe between 1850 and 1852, as
reported in Linforth's tables, we have a total of 15,094. The remainder
were not all converts from the U.S., for there was a considerable number
of persons who were not Mormons, probably 500 in all.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[399:3](hou19.htm#fr_564.md) *The Autobiography of
Parley Parker Pratt, one of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, embracing his Life, Ministry, and Travels,
with Extracts, in Prose and Verse, from his Miscellaneous Writings,
Edited by his son Parley P. Pratt*, New York, 1874, is one of the most
valuable works extant on the subject of Mormon missions. The author
relates in simple phrase the hardships, persecutions, and adventures
which he and other missionaries encountered in various parts of the
United States, and though probably he makes the most of them, there can
be little doubt that so far his narrative is in the main reliable.
Chosen a member of the first quorum in 1835, he was on terms of intimacy
with Joseph and Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and others
of the church dignitaries, and as the editor remarks, his history,
therefore, was so interwoven with that of the church, that many of the
most interesting sketches of church history will be found therein.' In
the autobiography, which covers a period of twenty years, from his early
boyhood to his betrayal into the hands of his enemies, of which more
hereafter, is an account of his life and travels, his missionary labors,
and the labors of those with whom he was associated, together with some
of his miscellaneous writings in prose and verse. Other works of this
author are: *An Appeal to the Inhabitants of the State of New York*, a
pamphlet <span id="page_400">p. 400</span> of six pages calling for help
and deliverance from the persecutions of the people of the United
States, particularly from their enemies in Missouri; *Letter to Queen
Victoria* is a dissertation on the fundamental principles of the faith,
dated Manchester, May 22, 1841. *The Fountain of Knowledge* is a short
essay on the scriptures. *Immortality and Eternal Life of the Material
Body* is an attempt to prove the proposition as named. *Intelligence and
Affection* comprises a few pages on these qualities in man, more
particularly in regard to their immortality. The above five pamphlets,
besides being published separately, were issued as one pamphlet at
Nauvoo. The third son of Jared and Charity Pratt, Parley, was born at
Burlington, Otsego co., N.Y., his ancestors being among the earliest
settlers at Hartford, Conn., in 1839, and probably among the party that
accompanied Thomas Hooker from Newtown, now Cambridge, Mass., in 1836.
Of his conversion to Mormonism I have already spoken, and of the leading
incidents in his life and the manner of his death mention is made
elsewhere. One of those who set forth from Nauvoo in Feb. 1846, he was
sent from Winter Quarters, as will be remembered, during the same year,
on a mission to England. But for this circumstance his *Autobiography*
would probably have included a complete and reliable account of the
great Mormon exodus, and one that would have been a most valuable
addition to the records of the latter-day saints. Parley was a man of
many miracles and visions. In fact, with him all was miraculous; the
voice of nature was the voice of God, and in one current ran revelation
and human happenings. He was miraculously directed in the first instance
to the book of Mormon and Joseph Smith. Myriads of false spirits were
rebuked by him and driven back into the darkness. During an illness he
had a dream. 'I thought I saw myself dressed in a clean and beautiful
linen robe, white as snow,' on which was written the words 'holy
prophet' and 'new Jerusalem.' At the elder's conference in Missouri,
February 1832, he was obliged to keep his bed, as he had not yet
recovered from his illness. At the close of it, he says, 'I requested
the elders to lay their hands on me and pray. They did so. I was
instantly healed.' Again, when detained by a severe fever, he whispered
to Brother Murdock to lay hands on him unobserved while giving him
water. I drank of it, he says, 'bounded on my feet, dressed myself, put
on my shoes and hat, and told him I was ready to start.' Still
travelling with Murdock, he was again taken ill, and again miraculously
cured. While engaged in fencing and ploughing six acres for wheat, he
heard a voice at night saying, Parley, Parley!' I answered, 'Here am I.'
Said the voice, 'Cease splitting rails, for the Lord hath prepared you
for a greater work.' He dreamed one night, during the troubles in
Missouri, of an attack by enemies at a distance, and learned afterward
that the vision was true. About to set out from Kirtland on a mission to
Canada in April 1836, being in debt and deeply depressed, his wife sick
and childless, Heber C. Kimball and other elders, filled with the spirit
of prophecy, entered his house late one night and said: 'Brother Parley,
thy wife shall be healed from this hour, and shall bear a son, and his
name snail be Parley, and he shall be a chosen instrument in the hands
of the Lord to inherit the priesthood and to walk in the steps of his
father.' Instances might be multiplied. Scores of sick women and
children in obedience to the command, 'In the name of Jesus Christ, be
thou made whole,' arose and walked.

Canada, north of Vermont, the first sermon, so far as is known, that was
ever delivered in the British dominions. *Utah Pioneers, 33d Ann*., 25.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[403:9](hou19.htm#fr_570.md) After retiring to
rest on a certain evening in April 1835 he was aroused by Heber C.
Kimball, who, being filled with the spirit of prophecy, said: 'Thou
shalt go to Upper Canada, even to the city of Toronto, the capital, and
there thou shalt find a people prepared for the fulness of the gospel,
and they shall receive thee.' *Pratt's Autobiog*., 141-2.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[405:10](hou19.htm#fr_571.md) After ministering at
Toronto and its neighborhood for about two months, the apostle announced
that he must return toKirtland, and, as he relates, on the eve of his
departure several hundred dollars were placed in his hands, though he
had asked no one for money, and none knew that the main reason for
returning was to arrange for the payment of his debts. Parley again
visited Toronto in April 1836, and labored there until spring of the
following year. *Id*., 166. In 1841, elders Morrison and Bates were
preaching near Kingston. *Times and Seasons*, ii. 415. About two years
later, Ben. Brown and Jesse W. Crosby preached in Montreal and Quebec.

Progress, and Travels*, 30-1. In *Tullidge's Women*, 246, it is stated
that 2,000 were baptized within eight months. This is probably
exaggerated. The first converts, nine in number, were baptized in the
Ribble, July 30, 1837. Names given in *Id*., 241.

*Patrick Hearty*, together with Parley and Orson Pratt, Geo. A. Smith,
Heber C. Kimball, and Reuben Hodlock. Brigham left his home in Montrose
on Sept. 14, 1839. Being in feeble health, he was carried to the house
of Heber C. Kimball, where he remained until the 18th, when they set
forth together. Mrs Mary Ann Young was left with an infant only ten days
old, and the youngest child of Mrs Kimball, who was then sick with
chills and fever, was only three weeks old. Heber, who was also
suffering from ague, relates that when he took leave of his family, it
seemed as if his very heart would melt within him. 'This is pretty
tough, is it not?' he remarked to Brigham. 'Let us rise up and give them
a cheer.' They arose, and swinging their hats, cried, 'Hurrah, hurrah,
hurrah for Israel!' Neither were in condition to travel, and both were
almost penniless. Arriving at Kirtland, which place they visited on
their way, Brigham had one New York shilling left, and Heber claims that
meanwhile the necessary funds had been supplied by some heavenly
messenger. The vessel sailed on the 19th of March, and reached Liverpool
on the 6th of April, the tenth anniversary of the organization of the
church. Brigham left the ship in company with Heber and Parley, and when
he landed shouted with a loud voice, 'Hosanna!' On the next day they
went to Preston by rail. *Hist. B. Young*, MS.; *Young's Jour*., in
*Millennial Star*, xxv. 711-12; *Times and Seasons*, ii. 223; *Whitney's
Woman's Exper*., MS. A parting hymn, composed by Parley a few days
before the vessel sailed, will be found in *Pratt's Autobiog*., 332, and
*Times and Seasons*, i. 111. On Dec. 8, 1839, elders Hiram Clark, Alex.
Wright, and Sam. Mulliner had arrived at Preston, and on Jan. 13, 1840,
elders Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, and Theodore Turley. *Id*., iii.
884.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[406:15](hou19.htm#fr_576.md) In the *Millennial
Star*, i. 20, is a list of most of the towns in which branches were
established, with the number of members in each.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[406:16](hou19.htm#fr_577.md) In *Id*., i. 302,
the number is given at 5,814, besides 800 who had emigrated to America
during that season. These figures include the Welsh, Irish, Scotch, and
Manx converts.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[407:17](hou19.htm#fr_578.md) During that term
3,400 persons had been baptized, 85 had emigrated, and 234 had died.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[407:19](hou19.htm#fr_580.md) In the *Millennial
Star*, xiii. 208, it is stated that, between May 30 and June 16, 1851,
£255–8–1 was received, or at the rate of about 80 cents *per capita* for
that period. In *Ibid*. we have a list of £1,965–2–1¾ due from the
various conferences for books, badges, etc.

    The first number of the *Millennial Star* was published in May 1840,
some few weeks after the arrival of Brigham Young and his party, Parley
P. <span id="page_408">p. 408</span> Pratt being the first editor.
Issued originally as a monthly, and afterward as a bi-monthly and then
as a weekly periodical, the circulation at one time teached 22,000
copies. *Richards’ Bibliog. of Utah*, MS., 8-9. But for this publication
and the *Frontier Guardian*, it would be impossible to fill the gap
which occurs in the records of the Mormon people between Feb. 15, 1846,
the date of the last issue of the *Times and Seasons*, and June 15,
1850, when appeared the first number of the *Deseret News*. For
conferences at which reports were received as to the condition of the
church branches at Manchester and elsewhere in 1840-1, see *Millennial

Young and his associates ended in Eng., and soon afterward they returned
home, first sending an epistle to the church in Great Britain, and
leaving Parley in charge. For text of epistle, see *Millenial Star*, i.
309-12. Brigham, Heber, O. Pratt, Woodruff, Taylor, Smith, and Richards
left for New York on the ship *Rochester*, on Apr. 20, 1841. Young
arrived in Nauvoo July 1st. *Tullidge's Life of Young*, 99-100. Parley
remained at the head of affairs until Oct. 29, 1842, when he sailed for
the U.S. on the *Emerald*, arriving in New Orleans early in Jan. 1843,
leaving Thomas Ward to succeed him, with Lorenzo Snow and Hiram Clark as
assistants. During Parley's administration, several parties of emigrants
were sent to the U.S. *Pratt's Autobiog*., 359, 361. The *Times and
Seasons* of Feb. 1, 1843, announces Pratt's arrival at Nauvoo. In June
1843, Elder Reuben Hadlock was appointed president of the English
mission, *Id*., iv. 232; and again in 1846, *Millennial Star*, vii. 42,
where the name is spelled Hedlock. Ward was associated with Hedlock in
the presidency. *Id*., v. 140, 142. In 1846-7 Orson Hyde was president
of the European mission. *Richards’ Narr*., MS., 27. For 1879, 32

of 1846 John Taylor, Parley Pratt, and Orson Hyde were ordered to
proceed to England, the saints being then encamped at Council Bluffs.
Procuring a flat-bottomed boat, they voyaged down the Missouri River to
Fort Leavenworth, where they met with some of the battalion men, and
thence took the steamer for St Louis. From that city they reached
England by way of New York, Parley, however, returning to Council Bluffs
and Winter Quarters with money contributed by the saints in the eastern
states for the assistance of their families and brethren, joining his
comrades later. The missionaries visited the various churches in
England, <span id="page_409">p. 409</span> Scotland, and Wales, and were
well received. Taylor relates that the converts were in the habit of
getting up tea-parties, at which he was often requested to sing, one of
the songs composed by himself being 'The Upper California, O that's the
land for me!' He also states that a marked feeling among the English was
the desire to emigrate. *Reminiscences*, MS., 18-19.

there. Jas Burnhaul reported front Wrexham on Dec. 23, 1840, that there
were about 100 saints in that neighborhood. On Feb. 10, 1841, the 2
churches had an aggregate membership of 150. *Utah Pioneers, 33d Ann*.,

*Times and Seasons*, iv. 232. Mackay, *The Mormons*, 247, says that
Mormonism was not preached in Dublin till 1850, but this statement is
doubtful. In Sept. 1840 Taylor visited the Isle of Man, accompanied by
Hiram Clark and one or two brethren from Liverpool. *Utah Pioneers, 33d
Ann*., 26. Taylor remained but a short time, being replaced by J.
Blakeslee in Nov. A church was organized at Douglas. Clark returned to

that the law extended toleration to all religious sects, and soon
afterward held a meeting; but a mob gathered round the hall where
service was being held and threatened to tear it down, as they had heard
that the elders were polygamists. Two of the missionaries were shot at
while making their escape from the island. *Smith's Rise, Progress, and

organized a church of 9 members at Montipeer township. *Times and
Seasons*, vi. 989. In March 1852 Jno. Murdock and Chas W. Wandell had
organized a church with a membership of 36 at Sydney. Early in 1853
Augustus Farnham, Wm Hyde, Burr Frost, Josiah W. Fleming, and others
landed at Sydney, and afterward extended their labors to Van Dieman's
Land and New Zealand. *Utah Pioneers, 33d Ann*., 26. *Smith's Rise,

in the above countries is given in *Utah Pion*., 26, and *Smith's Rise,
Progress, and Travels*, 34-6. In 1852 the Australian missions were
prosperous. *Deseret News*, May 28, 1853. In later years they were less
successful. On the 6th of April, 1876, Elder Croxall writes from Sidney
that the brethren are working faithfully in Australia, but meet with
little encouragement *Millennial Star*, xxxviii. 381. In this year there
were four Mormon missionaries at Christ Church, and one at Wellington,
N.Z. There were also two or more at Hobart Town, Tasmania. *Id*., 379,

*Joseph Smith the Prophet* were published in Danish, bringing his
history up to the time of the first publication of the book of Mormon.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[411:32](hou19.htm#fr_593.md) By order of Apostle
Snow, who had charge of the Scandinavian mission, Elder John Forsgren
proceeded to northern Sweden in 1850, where, at Geffie, he baptized 20
persons, but was sent out of the country by the authorities. In 1851
Elder Peterson was ordered to Norway, and organized a branch at Bergen.
*Utah Pioneers, 33d Ann*., 27. In 1879 the work had so greatly increased
that 23 missionaries were appointed for Scandinavia. A list of them is
given in *Millennial Star*, xli. 692-3. At the close of 1878 there were
in this mission 40 branches, 467 elders, and 4,158 members of the

their present position and prospects in Utah Territory, together with
American Exiles' Memorial to Congress, by Lorenzo Snow, one of the
Twelve Apostles, Liverpool and London, 1852, abbreviated from the
Italian edition*, was published for general circulation in various
languages, and is a well-written historical sketch, admirably adapted to
the purpose. Besides the expulsion from Missouri and Illinois, a general
view of their 'location, settlements, and government in Upper
California' is well presented. There is also an account of the
missionary labors of the ciders in the United States, Canada, England,
Wales, Scotland, and elsewhere.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[412:35](hou19.htm#fr_596.md) Branches of the
church were established in Switzerland, under the direction of Lorenzo
Snow, about the year 1850. *Utah Pioneers, 33d Ann*., 28. Soon afterward
Elder T. B. H. Stenhouse published at Geneva a volume, entitled *Le
Reflecteur*, and organized a branch of the church in the French quarter
of that city. *Richards’ Bibliog. of Utah*, MS., 11. In 1856-7 Elder
Jno. L. Smith published two volumes of a monthly periodical styled *Der

he and his fellow-missionaries were hard at work. About this time Jones
preached at the theatre in the city of Chihuahua, but was ill received.
*Millennial Star*, xxxviii. 381, 509. Portions of the book of Mormon
were translated into Spanish for the use of Mexicans, and entitled

1844 Addison Pratt was stationed on the island of Tooboui, Society
group, where he had organized a church with about a dozen members. At
the same time, Noah Rogers and Benj. F. Grouard were stationed at
Tahiti, but met with little success. In Oct. Rogers went to the island
of Huahiae. *Millennial Star*, v. 178-9, vi. 5-6, <span id="page_413">p.

B. Lewis as a donation to the mission. One of their number, K. F. Hanks,
died on the voyage and was buried at sea. They baptized over 1,200
natives. Other missionaries at these islands were Jas S. Brown, Alva
Hanks, and one Whittaker; but all were expelled by the French in 1851.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[413:39](hou19.htm#fr_600.md) Orson Hyde was
appointed by a general conference held at Nauvoo Apr. 6, 1840, to a
mission to the Jews in London, Amsterdam, Constantinople, and Jerusalem.
He arrived in the last-mentioned city Oct. 24, 1841, and returned to
Nauvoo in 1842. *Utah Pioneers, 33d Ann*., 26. By his own efforts, he
raised the money for his passage, often suffering great privation during
his labors, his only food at times being snails. Of Jewish descent, he
stirred up his unbelieving race in the towns to which he was sent to a
livelier faith in the promises of their gathering, and consecrated their
land anew to their restoration, when the glory of their latter house
should be greater than the glory of their former house. *Richards’ Utah
Miscell*., MS., 18. See also *Smith's Rise, Progress, and Travels*, 31;

is given in *Millennial Star*, xli, 110-11.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[414:41](hou19.htm#fr_602.md) Remy, *Jour. to
G. S. L. City*, ii. 212-13, gives a table of the approximate number of
Mormons in each country in 1859. The total is 186,000, of whom 80,000
were in Utah, 40,000 in other states and territories, 32,000 in England
and Scotland, 8,000 in British America, 5,000 in Norway, Sweden, and
Denmark, and 7,000 in the Sandwich and Society islands. His figures are
at least 20 per cent too high. The entire population of Utah, for
instance, was not more than 60,000 at this date. A writer in the *Hist.
Mag*., March 1859, p. 85, places the total at 126,000, of whom 38,000
were residents of Utah. Add 20,000 more for Utah, and we have a total of
146,000 which may be accepted approximately as the correct figures.
Other estimates differ widely, the Mormons themselves, in an official
statement published in the *Deseret News*, in 1856, claiming 480,000
members of the church in all parts of the world. See *American Almanac*,
1858, 338.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[414:42](hou19.htm#fr_603.md) Linforth gives the
number despatched by the British agency between 1840 and 1852 at 11,296.
*Route from Liverpool*, 15. The first vessel sent from England was the
*North America*, which sailed TJune 16, 1840. The ship started on
another voyage Sept. 8th of the same year. In *Burton's City of the
Saints*, 361-2, is a list of vessels that sailed between 1851 and 1861.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[414:43](hou19.htm#fr_604.md) Estimated by Ezra T.
Benson at 10,000 souls. It was probably less than half that number. The
census of 1850 places the population of the territory at a little over
11,000; the reports of the bishops of wards at the Oct. conference in
1853, as given in *Richards’ Hist. Incidents of Utah*, MS., 39, at
18,206.

Emigrating Fund*, MS. On Sunday Sept. 9, 1849, it was voted that a
perpetual fund be instituted in aid of the poor among the latter-day
saints, and that Willard Snow, John D. Lee, Lorenzo Snow, Franklin D.
Richards, and John S. Fullmer be appointed a committee. At a general
conference of the church, held Oct. 6th and 7th, it was ordered that the
committee should raise funds for this purpose, to be placed in charge of
Edward Hunter, and that the control of the funds be under the direction
of the first presidency. On Sept. 15th Brigham Young was chosen
president and Willard Richards was afterward appointed secretary. *Utah
Early Records*, MS., 95, 97, 113, 114. The company was incorporated by
the provisional government of the state of Deseret, Sept. 14, 1850, and
the act of incorporation was made legal Oct. 4, 1851, and amended and
confirmed by the same body Jan. 12, 1856. The company began rendering
material aid on the 13th of March, 1850. On Sept. 3, 1852, the first
company of emigrants assisted by this fund arrived at S. L. City in
charge of Abraham O. Smoot. *Richards’ Hist. Incidents of Utah*, MS.,

thus helped arrive here, they will give their obligations to the church
to refund the amount of what they have received as soon as circumstances
will admit,…the funds to be appropriated as a loan rather than a gift.'
*Hist. B. Young*, MS., 1849, 152-3. Immigrants nearly all came to Salt

from Liverpool*, 12. In the *Millennial Star*, xv. 618, is a notice that
the first ship of the season would sail early in Jan. 1853. Each
application must be accompanied by a statement of the name, age,
occupation, and nativity of the applicant, and by a deposit of £1.
Parties were to provide their own bedding and cooking utensils.
Richards, *Narr*., MS., 32, remarks that vessels from New Orleans could
be chartered at low rates, as they could seldom obtain return freight.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[417:50](hou19.htm#fr_611.md) At this date the
price of a team, including wagon, two yoke of oxen, and two milch cows,
was about £40. *Linforth's Route from Liverpool*, 12.

committeemen) to see that no improprieties occurred among the people, or
between our people and the sailors.' *Richards’ Narr*., MS., 31. In 1855
the line of route was changed to Philadelphia and New York, and thence
to Cincinnati. *Richards’ Incidents in Utah Hist*., MS., 6.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[419:52](hou19.htm#fr_613.md) For each adult,
weekly, 2½ lbs bread or biscuit, 1 lb. wheat flour, 5 lbs oatmeal, 2 lbs
rice, ½ lb. sugar, 2 oz. tea, 2 oz. salt. Three quarts of water were
allowed per diem. *Linforth's Route from Liverpool*, 20. Twenty pounds
of breadstuffs per capita and an allowance of butter and cheese were
provided by the Mormon superintendent. *Mackay, The Mormons*, 270. Meat
was often issued in lieu of meal or bread.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[419:53](hou19.htm#fr_614.md) All were required to
be in their berths at 8 o'clock, and before 7 the beds were made and the
decks swept. *Mackay, The Mormons*, 272.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[419:54](hou19.htm#fr_615.md) In the *Deseret

from St Louis, with a list of those who were killed by the accident.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[420:55](hou19.htm#fr_616.md) For those assisted
by the emigration fund in 1853 was supplied for each wagon 1,000 lbs of
flour, 50 lbs each of sugar, rice, and bacon, 30 of beans, 20 of dried
apples or peaches, 25 of salt, 5 of tea, a gallon of vinegar, and 10
bars of soap. *Linforth's Route from Liverpool*, 19.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[420:56](hou19.htm#fr_617.md) Describing one of
these trains which he encountered in the valley of the Weber on Sept. 2,
1850, Capt. Stunsbury says: 'Ninety-five wagons were met to-day
containing the advance of the Mormon emigration to the Valley of the
Salt Lake. Two large flocks of sheep were driven before the train; and
geese <span id="page_XXX">p. XXX</span> and turkeys had been conveyed in
coops the whole distance without apparent damage…The appearance of this
train was good, most of the wagons having from three to five yoke of
cattle, and all in fine condition. The wagons swarmed with women and
children, and I estimated the train at one thousand head of cattle, 100
head of sheep, and 500 human souls.' *Exped. to G. S. Lake*, 223.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[422:58](hou19.htm#fr_619.md) In a letter dated
Muddy Fork—930 miles from Winter Quarters—Oct. 18, 1849, and published
in the *Frontier Guardian*, Dec. 26th, of that year, George A. Smith
writes: 'Among others we noticed at the South Pass of the Rocky
Mountains the grave of one E. Dodd, of Gallatin, Mo., died on the 19th
of July last of typhus fever. The wolves had completely disinterred him.
The clothes in which he had been buried lay strewed around. His under
jawbone lay in the grave, with the teeth complete, the only remains
discernable of him. It is believed he was the same Dodd that took an
active part, and a prominent mobocrat, in the murder of the saints at
Haun's Mills, Mo. If so, it is a righteous retribution.'

<span id="fn_622"></span>[423:61](hou19.htm#fr_622.md) The first arrived
Sept. 26th, and were met by the first presidency and a large number of
the citizens, with an escort of cavalry and the bands of the Nauvoo
legion. *Deseret News*, Oct. 6, 1856.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[425:62](hou19.htm#fr_623.md) At this point the
country was alive with buffaloes.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[428:63](hou19.htm#fr_624.md) My account of the
hand-cart emigration is taken principally from Mr Chislett's narrative
in *Stenhouse's Rocky Mountain Saints*, 312-338. The story as told in
*Stenhouse's Tell It All*, 206-36, though it claims to have been written
by one of the women of the party, and perhaps was so written, is merely
an adaptation of the above. Another version will be found in *Young's
Wife No. 19*, 206-21. For other mention of the hand-cart emigration, see
*Siskiyou Co. Affairs*, MS., 18; *Paddock's La Tour*, 345; *Deseret

Alta*, Nov. 12, 13, 1856; *S. F. Bulletin*, Jan. 12, 1857. In hundreds
of newspapers and magazines appeared grossly exaggerated descriptions of
this disaster, of which the following, taken from the *Or. Statesman*,
June 15, 1857, may serve as a specimen: 'Of the 2,500 persons who
started from the frontier, only about 200 frost-bitten, starving, and
emaciated beings lived to tell the tale of their sufferings. The
remaining 2,300 perished on the way of hunger, cold, and fatigue.' The
emigrants <span id="page_XXX">p. XXX</span> were happy and content,
until winter overtook them in the mountains, singing as they journeyed,
one of their songs commencing:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

'We're going to Zion with our carts,  
And the spirit of God within our hearts;'

</div>

the chorus of another, sung to the tune of 'A little more cider:'

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Hurrah for the camp of Israel!  
Hurrah for the hand-cart scheme!  
Hurrah! Hurrah! ’tis better far  
Than wagon and ox-team.'

</div>

<span id="fn_625"></span>[429:64](hou19.htm#fr_625.md) The October
conference was then in session.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[430:65](hou19.htm#fr_626.md) It was from Iowa

    Among the Mormon works largely circulated throughout the British
Isles and Europe was one published in 1852, and entitled *The Government
of God, by John Taylor, one of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.* In a preface by James Linforth, the
writer states that it had been the author's intention to superintend the
publication of this work, an 8vo volume of 118 pages, in person; but the
cares pretaining to his missionary labors and literary work, then more
urgently needed, prevented him. He therefore, on his departure for Salt
Lake City in the spring of 1852, left with Mr Linforth the manuscript,
the printing of which was superintended by him. As a dissertation on a
general and abstract subject, it probably has not its equal in point of
ability within the whole range of Mormon literature. The style is lofty
and clear, and every page betokens the great learning of the author. As
a student of ancient and modern history, theologian, and moral
philosopher, President Taylor is justly entitled to the front rank;
while his proficiency in foreign languages and his knowledge of men and
of practical affairs rendered his services no less important as manager
abroad than as executive officer at home.

    I will here begin the biographical notices of the leading men of
Utah, and of some of the pioneers, carrying the same along in the notes
to the end of the volume as I have done in other cases in my historical
works. The lives of some have already been fully given; and in regard to
some of the others who have not yet finished playing their part in the
history of the country, their biographies will be given here but
partially, and finished as the work proceeds.

    First after Joseph Smith and Brigham Young should be mentioned John
Taylor, third president of the entire church. A native of Milnthorpe,
England, where he was born in November 1808, Taylor emigrated in 1829 to
Toronto, Canada, to which city his father had removed two years before.
Here, joining a methodist society, he searched the scriptures earnestly,
and became convinced that the churches had fallen from grace and were
corrupt. With prayer and fasting he besought the Lord that if there were
a true church on earth he would send a messenger to him. Shortly
afterward he was visited by Parley P. Pratt, to whom he gave but a cool
reception, as many evil reports concerning Mormonism were then current.
But after close scrutiny, he and several of his friends believed and
were baptized. In 1838 it was ordered by revelation that he should be
appointed an apostle, and after the schism of that year he filled the
vacancy in the quorum caused by the apostasy of John Boynton. In 1840 he
arrived in England as a missionary, his labors extending to Ireland and
to the Isle of Man, where he was the first to preach the doctrines of
Mormonism. While on a visit to Scotland, he corrected the proof-sheets
of the book of Mormon, and helped to prepare a hymn-book for the use of
converts in the British Islands. He also wrote several pamphlets in
reply to charges against the church. Returning to America in 1841, in
company with Brigham Young, he proceeded to Nauvoo, where he was
selected one of a committee to petition congress for a redress of
wrongs, and presented the petition. He also purchased and took charge of
the *Times and Seasons,* at the request of the prophet, the last three
volumes being published under his direction, and was chosen a member of
the city council, a regent of the university, and judge-advocate of the
Nauvoo legion. He was firmly attached to the prophet, and at Carthage
jail, as we have seen, almost lost his life in attempting to save him.
After the expulsion he went, with others of the twelve, to Winter
Quarters, where he assisted in organizing the Mormon battalion. At this
juncture he was again ordered to England, in company with Parley P.
Pratt and Orson Hyde, and returning the following spring, accompanied
Pratt's companies to Salt Lake City. In October 1849 he was sent as a
missionary to France, where he published a monthly paper, styled <span
id="page_434">p. 434</span> *L'Etoile du Deseret.* Before leaving Europe
he translated the book of Mormon into the French language, and preached
the gospel of the saints at Hamburg, where under his direction the same
work was translated into German, and where he also published a monthly
paper named *Zion's Panier.* Returning to Salt Lake City in 1852, he was
elected, two years afterward, a member of the legislature, but resigning
this office, went as a missionary to New York, where he superintended
the affairs of the church in the eastern states, and established a
journal, the first number of which appeared Feb. 17, 1855, under the
title of *The Mormon,* the paper being discontinued in 1857, when Taylor
was recalled at the outbreak of the Utah war. After that date, his
labors were mainly confined to the territory, where he was partly
engaged in literary work for the church, serving also for a brief term
as probate judge of Utah county, and for several terms as a member of
the Utah legislature and speaker of the house. In Oct. 1880 he was
appointed, as we shall see later, president of the church of Jesus
Christ of latter-day saints. Further details as to his early career will
be found in *Hist. B. Young,* MS.; *Woodruffs Journal,* MS.; *Richards’
Narr.,* MS., and many other manuscripts and books.

    George Q. Cannon, a native of Liverpool, England, was trained in the
Mormon faith, his parents having been converted in 1839, when he was
twelve years of age, through the preaching of John Taylor, who some time
before had married his father's sister. A short time before the
assassination of Joseph Smith the family arrived at Nauvoo, where George
found employment as a printer in the office of the *Times and Seasons*
and *Nauvoo Neighbor.* In 1847 he set out for S. L. City with Parley
Pratt's companies, and for two years was engaged in farming,
house-building, and other labor incidental to new settlements. In the
autumn of 1849 he went to California in company with Chas C. Rich, and
there worked in the gold mines until the summer of 1850, when he was
sent on a mission to the Sandwich Islands. On arriving at Honolulu he
began to study the Hawaiian language, which he mastered in six weeks,
and then travelled and preached among the natives, organizing several
branches of the church. In 1854 he returned to Salt Lake City, and the
following year went as a missionary to California, where he established
and edited a newspaper called the *Western Standard.* When news arrived
of the Utah war, he again returned to the valley, and during the exodus
of 1858 took charge of the press and printing materials of the *Deseret
News,* which were conveyed to Fillmore City. In October 1859 he was
chosen an apostle to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Parley
Pratt, and was afterward appointed president of the European mission. In
1862 he was ordered to Washington to support the claims of Utah to
admission as a state, of which more later. After the adjournment of
congress he repaired to England, where he labored until August 1864,
13,000 converts being forwarded to Zion during this period. Being then
summoned home, he was elected a member of the legislative council, and
was for three years private secretary to Brigham Young. In 1867 he
became editor and publisher of the *Deseret News,* which was then a
semiweekly paper, and started the *Deseret Evening News,* which was
issued daily, his connection with the latter continuing until the autumn
of 1872, when he was chosen delegate to congress. In 1880 Mr Cannon was
appointed first councillor to President John Taylor. For further
particulars, see authorities before quoted; also *Sala's America
Revisited,* 302; *Reno Daily Gazette,* Jan. 24, 1882.

    Joseph F., the son of Hyrum Smith, who with his brother, the
prophet, was assassinated at Carthage jail, was born at Far West, Mo.,
in 1838. After passing his early youth among the vicissitudes attending
the expulsion from Nauvoo and the colonization of Utah, he was ordered,
when 16 years of age, to proceed as a missionary to the Sandwich
Islands, where he labored earnestly and with marked success. 'By the
blessing of the almighty,' he writes, 'I acquired the language of the
islanders, and commenced my labors, preaching, baptizing, etc., among
the natives, in one hundred days after my arrival at Honolulu.' At the
beginning of the Utah war he returned to S. L. City and served in the
militia up to the time when Johnston's army entered <span
id="page_435">p. 435</span> the valley. In 1860 he was sent on mission
work to England, where he remained till 1863, being again ordered, the
following year, to the Sandwich Islands in company with A. L. Smith, L.
Snow, E. T. Benson, and W. W. Cluff. Returning in 1865, he was soon
after elected an apostle and a member of the legislature, in which
latter capacity he served until 1872. In 1874 and 1875 he presided over
the British mission, and in 1880 was chosen second councillor to
President Taylor. For additional items, see above authorities.

    Wilford, the third son of Aphek and Beulah Thompson Woodruff, was
born at Farmington (now Avon), Conn., in March 1807, his ancestors for
at least three generations being residents of that neighborhood. In 1632
he was converted to Mormonism, together with his brother Azmon, and soon
afterward cast in his lot at Kirtland, where, for a time, he was the
guest of Joseph Smith. Two years later he started on a missionary tour
in company with an elder named Brown, journeying on foot through
southern Missouri, northern Arkansas, and western Tennessee. In 1837 he
was appointed a member of the first quorum of the seventies, and in
April of this year, was married to Phoebe W. Carter at the house of
Joseph Smith. In 1839 he was chosen an apostle, and soon afterward was
sent on a mission to England, where, in a few months, he and his
fellow-missionaries baptized more than 1,800 proselytes, their success
being so remarkable as to alarm the orthodox clergy, who brought the
matter before the notice of parliament. In 1841 he was shipwrecked at
Lake Michigan while on his way to Nauvoo, but escaped with his life and
reached that city in October. A few weeks before the assassination of
Joseph and Hyrum Smith, he was again ordered to England as a missionary,
returning in 1846, when he crossed the plains with the pioneer band. In
1848 we find him once more a missionary, this time in the eastern
states, whence he returned to Salt Lake City in 1850, being elected in
December of that year a senator for the provisional state of Deseret.
After that date he became one of the foremost men in Utah, the church
annals being largely compiled from his records. In his public career he
is regarded as one of the founders of the territory; his apostolic
labors have earned for him among the saints the title of 'Wilford the
faithful.' *Woodruff's Leaves from Journal,* 1-96; *Millennial Star,*
xxvii. passim; *Times and Seasons,* v. 692; *Deseret News,* July 7, 14,
1858.

    Among the pioneers was Willard Richards, born at Hopkinton,
Middlesex county, Mass., on the 24th of June, 1804. Under the
instruction of his parents, Joseph and Rhoda Richards, he applied
himself during his youth to the study of theology, but could not discern
in the doctrines of any of the sects around him the fulness of truth. In
1835 he obtained a copy of the book of Mormon, and reading it through
twice in ten days, became convinced of its divine authenticity. At this
date he was practising medicine at Boston, but at once resolved to
remove to Kirtland, where a year later he was baptized and ordained an
elder by his cousin, Brigham Young. Proceeding on a mission to England,
he labored successfully, and in April 1840 was chosen by revelation one
of the twelve. Returning to America, he was appointed historian and
general recorder to the church, which offices he held until his decease
in March 1854. He was an intimate friend of the prophet's, and, as will
be remembered, was present at his assassination in Carthage jail. In
1848, after the return of the pioneer band, he was appointed second
councillor to the president. He was also editor of the *Deseret News,*
the official organ of the church, and wrote most of the general epistles
of the twelve to the brethren throughout the world. After the
organization of the state of Deseret he was made secretary of state, and
afterward presided over the council of the legislative assembly. The
last occasion on which he left his house was for the purpose of
addressing the council at the close of its session. 'I will go and
perform this duty,' he said, 'if, like John Quincy Adams, I die in the
attempt; but no one knows the aggravated extent of my bodily malady.
Death stares me in the face, waiting for his prey.' Further particulars
will be found in *The Millennial ,Star,* xxvii. 118-20, 133-6, 150-2,
165-6; <span id="page_436">p. 436</span> *Linforth's Route from
Liverpool,* 75-6; *Deseret News,* March 16, 1854, June 23, 30, 1858,

    Franklin Dewey Richards, nephew to Willard, was born at Richmond,
Berkshire co., Mass., on April 2, 1821. After receiving a common-school
education, he was employed at farm labor, or at his father's trade—that
of carpenter. His attention was first called to Mormonism during a visit
of Brigham to the house of his grandfather, Joseph Richards. On the 3d
of June, 1838, he relates that after being baptized and anointed with
oil, he was cured, by the efficacy of prayer, of a severe sickness. In
October following, he set forth for Far West, but finding that Gen.
Clark had issued an order requiring all Mormons to leave the state, he
went to St Louis, where he found employment. In the spring of 1840 he
attended a conference at Nauvoo, and was soon afterward sent as a
missionary to Indiana, where he established a church. After some further
missionary work in the United States, he repaired to Nauvoo where he
married, and by great self-denial obtained the means of building a brick
house in the eastern part of the city. This he sold before the expulsion
for two yoke of oxen and an old wagon. In the spring of 1844 he was
ordered with several others to proceed on a mission to England, but
after reaching New York he heard of the assassination of the prophet,
and returned to Nauvoo. In 1845 he assisted at the completion of the
temple, working as a carpenter and painter. When the first bands of the
saints crossed the Mississippi in Feb. 1856, Mr Richards accompanied
them as far as their camping-ground on Sugar Creek, where he bade adieu
to his wife and family, and soon afterward sailed for Liverpool in
company with Parley P. Pratt and others. Of further incidents in his
life, I shall have occasion to speak elsewhere.

    Heber Chase Kimball was a native of Sheldon, Vt, where he was born
in 1801. When ten years of age his family removed to West Bloomfield,
N.Y., in which town he afterward worked as a blacksmith in his father's
shop. In 1820, his father having lost his property, he was compelled to
seek his own livelihood, and after suffering much hardship, found
employment with his brother, who was a potter by trade, and removed with
him to Mendon. He was converted to Mormonism by the preaching of Phiheas
H. Young, and in 1832 was baptized, and soon afterward ordained an
Elder. In Sept. of this year he went to Kirtland with Brigham and Joseph
Young, and there met the prophet. In 1835 he was chosen a member of the
first quorum of the twelve, and from that date until the expulsion from
Nauvoo his time was mainly spent in missionary labors in the eastern
states and in England. Returning from Salt Lake City to Winter Quarters
with the main body of the pioneers, he was appointed first councillor to
the president, which office he held until his decease, in June 1868. On
the organization of the state of Deseret, he was elected
lieutenant-governor and chief justice, and later became president of the
council of the legislative assembly. A man of singular generosity,
integrity, and purity of heart, there are few whose names are held in
more esteem among the latter-day saints than that of President Kimball.

    In March 1850 occurred the decease of Oliver Cowdery, at Richmond,
Ray co., Mo. His connection with the church from its earliest days, and
the part which he took in the translation of the book of Mormon, have
already been mentioned. He was cut off, as we have seen, in 1838, but in
1848 was rebaptized. 'His relation of events,' remarks S. W. Richards,
'was of no ordinary character, maintaining unequivocally all those
written testimonies he had furnished to the church in earlier days.
Moroni, Peter, James, and John, and other heavenly messengers who had
ministered to him in connection with the prophet, Joseph Smith, were
familiarly but sacredly spoken of.' After his second conversion he
devoted the brief remainder of his life entirely to the cause of the
church, declaring his willingness to go forth among the nations and bear
testimony of that which had been revealed to him—a testimony which none
but he could bear. *Contributor,* 1884, p. 446.
