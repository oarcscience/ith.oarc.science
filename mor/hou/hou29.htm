<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> all the stages of her existence, Utah has been constantly expanding, her growth, far from depleting her resources, only adding to her strength. Originally one of the most barren spots on the face of nature, with nothing to attract even attention, the land has become as fruitful a field, and her people as busy a commonwealth, as can be found, with few exceptions, elsewhere on the Pacific slope. With her unkindly soil, her extremes of temperature, the thermometer varying between 110&deg; above and 20&deg; below zero,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1148"></A><A HREF="#fn_1148"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> her slight and uncertain rainfall, without foliage, except such as was found here and there in narrow, rock-ribbed gorges, with fuel almost inaccessible at points where habitation was possible, with no nearer sources of general supply than the small and scattered communities on the Pacific coast, and with all sources of supply often practically cut off&#8212;amid this forbidding and</p>

<p>inhospitable region, the Mormons built up their settlements, which, nevertheless, grew with a steady and stalwart growth. As year followed year, the magic wand of progress touched into life these barren and sand-girt solitudes, and in their place sprang up a country teeming with the wealth of gardens and granaries, of mines and mills, of farms and factories. To show how this has been accomplished, and more especially to explain the industrial and social condition of the people during the first years of the present decade, will be my task in the concluding chapters of this volume.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the close of 1883 the population of Utah was estimated at 178,121, of whom 92,081 were males, 86,040 females, 123,506 of native and 54,615 of foreign birth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1149"></A><A HREF="#fn_1149"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> In 1880 there were 14,550 persons employed in agriculture, 4,149 in trade, and 10,212 miners, mechanics, and factory operatives; though notwithstanding the industrial activity of the settlers, the percentage of bread-winners was smaller than in any state or territory of the union with the exception of West Virginia, this fact being due mainly to the large proportion of women and young children. A noteworthy feature in the community was the small amount of debt, crime, and pauperism, the entire public debt, city, county, and territorial, being in 1879 only $116,251, and the number of criminals and paupers being, as elsewhere noticed, much below the average throughout the United States.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1150"></A><A HREF="#fn_1150"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> The death-rate for a series of years averaged about sixteen per thousand, though for 1880 it was somewhat higher on account of the prevalence of diphtheria.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1151"></A><A HREF="#fn_1151"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the progress of settlement up to the close of 1862 mention has already been made.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1152"></A><A HREF="#fn_1152"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> At that date nearly all the available land in Utah had been taken up, and in 1883 colonies had been pushed forward into adjoining territories, until they extended from north to south in an unbroken line of about 1,000 miles, all of them under the religious and political control of the Mormon priesthood.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1153"></A><A HREF="#fn_1153"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Paris is said to be France, so it has been said of Salt Lake City that it is Utah, for there the commerce,</p>  
<p><a name="page_695"><font size="1" color="green">p. 695</font></A></p>  
<p>arts, industries, and interests of the territory are mainly centred. In 1883 the capital contained a fixed population of about 25,000, its corporate limits including about fifty square miles,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1154"></A><A HREF="#fn_1154"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> divided into five municipal and twenty-one ecclesiastical wards. The city was well supplied with all modern comforts and conveniences, including gas and electric lights,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1155"></A><A HREF="#fn_1155"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> street-railroads,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1156"></A><A HREF="#fn_1156"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> hotels,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1157"></A><A HREF="#fn_1157"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> markets, libraries, theatres,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1158"></A><A HREF="#fn_1158"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> clubs, and saloons, where men might drink, smoke, and discuss politics and religion. Through all the streets, which were about double the usual width, ran the limpid waters of City Creek, the Jordan, Red Butte,</p>

<p>and Emigration ca&ntilde;ons,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1159"></A><A HREF="#fn_1159"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> cooling the air, cleansing the thoroughfares, and giving life to verdure. The adjacent lands were cultivated, and most of the houses were surrounded with orchards, so that in early summer Zion wore the appearance of Eden in bloom. The flowers were full of beauty and fragrance, surpassing, if possible, in this respect, the ancient towns of Mexico, or the modern capital in the days of Cort&eacute;s.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the temple and the tabernacle, Salt Lake City thus far had little to boast of in the way of architecture, nor was that little interesting. The temple, when finished, was to cost several millions,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1160"></A><A HREF="#fn_1160"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> and the walls of gray granite, more than six feet in thickness, with a length of 200 and a width of 100 feet, were to reach a height of 100 feet.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1161"></A><A HREF="#fn_1161"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> It was determined that this building should be of elegant design, magnificent proportions, and unique pattern, a marvel of beauty, strength, and solidity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1162"></A><A HREF="#fn_1162"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> As a structure in which a vast assemblage can see and hear, the new tabernacle, west of the temple, completed in 1870, is a remarkable edifice. It is elliptical in shape, with a primitive diameter of 233 feet, a conjugate of 133 feet, and a height of 70 feet, its huge dome-shaped, or as some term it, dish-cover roof of heavy, bolted lattice-work resting on sandstone pillars.</p>

<p>Its seating capacity is about 9,000,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1163"></A><A HREF="#fn_1163"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> and in the building are twenty doors, some nine feet in width, and all of them opening outward, so that in case of fire a full congregation can make its exit in three or four minutes. As was the case in the old tabernacle,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1164"></A><A HREF="#fn_1164"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> the acoustic properties are remarkably good, and it is said that one standing in the east end of the gallery and uttering a few words in his lowest tone can be distinctly heard in the amphitheatre where the church dignitaries are seated, at the opposite end of the building.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1165"></A><A HREF="#fn_1165"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the site of the old tabernacle now stands the new assembly hall,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1166"></A><A HREF="#fn_1166"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A> which is also the stake house for the Salt Lake stake of Zion. It is built of rough-hewn granite, the rock being taken from the same quarry that supplies material for the temple, and with frescoed ceiling, representing important events in church history. Though church-like in appearance, it is considered one of the most sightly structures in the city.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1167"></A><A HREF="#fn_1167"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> Of the endowment house and other buildings on temple block mention has been made elsewhere.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On South Temple street is the museum, where are specimens of home art, in painting and sculpture, also home products and manufactures, as in cotton, wool, silk, cloth, paper; gold and silver bullion and coins, with samples of the ores and minerals of Utah;</p>

<p>petrifactions, fossils, and obsidian; Indian weapons, scalps, ornaments, pottery, wampum, and the boat in which Kit Carson crossed the waters of great Salt Lake&#8212;the first craft launched by white man into the Dead Sea of the West.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1168"></A><A HREF="#fn_1168"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other prominent buildings in Salt Lake City, and many points of interest within easy reach of the capital, as Great Salt Lake, the mineral springs, Fort Douglas, Parley's park, the Cottonwoods, Ensign and Twin peaks, Echo ca&ntilde;on, American Fork ca&ntilde;on&#8212;the so called Yosemite of Utah&#8212;have been described for the most part in other portions of this volume, and in many of the countless volumes that have been written concerning the Mormons.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to see Salt Lake City at its best, one should stroll about three o'clock in the afternoon through Main and Temple streets, which are to this city what Market and Kearny streets are to San Francisco. At that time the spacious sidewalks are crowded with well-dressed women passing to and fro among the shops, prominent among which stands out the Zion's co&ouml;perative store, or, as it is usually termed, "Zion's Co&ouml;p." In no part of the city, or elsewhere in Utah, are there signs of abject poverty, and there are few beggars, tramps, or drones, the idle and dissolute being discountenanced by the community.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1169"></A><A HREF="#fn_1169"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not communists, the elements of socialism enter strongly into all their relations, public and private, social, commercial, and industrial, as well as religious and political. This tends to render them exclusive, independent of the gentiles and their government, and even in some respects antagonistic to them. They have assisted each other until nine out of ten own their farms, while commerce and manufacturing are to a large extent co&ouml;perative. The rights of property are respected; but while a Mormon may sell his farm to a gentile, it would not be deemed good fellowship for him to do so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salt Lake county contained, in 1883, nearly one fifth of the population of Utah, the eastern side of the valley, where the streams of the Wasatch Mountains are utilized for irrigation, being the principal farming section; while the western portion, in the neighborhood of the Oquirrh Range, was but sparsely settled. In this county were found, with the exception perhaps of coal, nearly all the minerals that contribute to the wealth of communities. Alta, the mining town of Little Cottonwood, contained a considerable population until the spring of 1878, when it was almost destroyed by fire. Bingham, about thirty miles south-west of the capital, was surrounded by productive mines; and Sandy, where the Bingham ca&ntilde;on and Cottonwood ores were forwarded for sampling, was a thriving village.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1170"></A><A HREF="#fn_1170"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the establishment and progress of other settlements, up to the close of 1862, mention has already been made.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1171"></A><A HREF="#fn_1171"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A> Davis county, north of Salt Lake, was settled by quiet pastoral and agricultural communities of the old-fashioned type. Farmington, Centreville, Kaysville,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1172"></A><A HREF="#fn_1172"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A> and the three towns named Bountiful,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1173"></A><A HREF="#fn_1173"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A> were, in 1886, reasonably prosperous, resembling somewhat small English villages, except for the fact that no ale-houses were to be seen in their midst.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ogden, or, as it was sometimes erroneously called, Junction City, the site of which was purchased, as the reader will remember, in 1848, for some $2,000 or $3,000, ranked in 1883 next to Salt Lake City in population.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1174"></A><A HREF="#fn_1174"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A> In the centre of a network of railroads and of a prosperous agricultural region, with excellent</p>

<p>manufacturing facilities, and with many of the attractions and conveniences of modern cities, including a theatre&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1175"></A><A HREF="#fn_1175"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A> and one of the best hotels in the country, with gentile churches and schools, both protestant and catholic, the western terminus of the Union Pacific was probably the most cosmopolitan town in Utah.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1176"></A><A HREF="#fn_1176"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A> Among the other settlements of Weber county the most prominent were North Ogden,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1177"></A><A HREF="#fn_1177"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A> Harrisville, Huntsville,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1178"></A><A HREF="#fn_1178"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A> Lynne,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1179"></A><A HREF="#fn_1179"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A> Slaterville, Uintah, Plain City, Hooperville, and West Weber.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1180"></A><A HREF="#fn_1180"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Cache county were added to the settlements already mentioned Richmond, a farming town&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1181"></A><A HREF="#fn_1181"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A> on the line of the Utah and Northern railroad; Lewiston on the west bank of Bear River, opposite Richmond; Benson, eight miles south-west of Logan; and Newton, a thriving village a little to the north-west of the same town.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1182"></A><A HREF="#fn_1182"><FONT SIZE="1">35</FONT></A> The corner-stones of the Logan temple were laid in 1877, its site being chosen by Brigham a few weeks before his death. The structure is of stone, painted and plastered in variegated tints, and capped with an iron roof.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1183"></A><A HREF="#fn_1183"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich, or as it was first termed Richland, county, in the north-eastern corner of the territory, was organized in 1864, being carved out of Cache county,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1184"></A><A HREF="#fn_1184"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A> Randolph, the county seat, near its centre, and surrounded with excellent pasture-land, Garden City at its extreme north-west, and Woodruff&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1185"></A><A HREF="#fn_1185"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A> on Bear River, being now the principal settlements. The limits of Summit county on the south were extended in 1872 by an act of the Utah legislature, and in 1886 it was bounded on the north by Wyoming and Morgan county, and on the south, east, and west by Uintah, Wasatch, Morgan, and Salt Lake counties. In 1883 Park City, the centre of supply for the Ontario and other mines, was the most considerable town.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1186"></A><A HREF="#fn_1186"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A></p>

The site of the former was remarkably picturesque.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1187"></A><A HREF="#fn_1187"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A> Tooele and Grantsville, in Tooele county, south of Box Elder, had each in 1880 a population of about 1,200, and Corinne, incorporated in 1870, about 400.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1188"></A><A HREF="#fn_1188"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A> Nephi, the county seat of Juab county,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1189"></A><A HREF="#fn_1189"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A> contained in 1880 a thriving population of about 2,500, most of them farmers, though the manufacturing interests of this town were not inconsiderable, the Tintic mines furnishing a market for surplus lumber and produce.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1190"></A><A HREF="#fn_1190"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A></p>

<p>inhabitants of Provo, the county seat, built up a settlement that ranked among the leading towns of Utah, with handsome public and private buildings, a theatre, a large tabernacle, and, as will presently be mentioned, the largest woollen-mill in the territory. Prominent among its industries was the drying of fruit, of which several hundred tons were forwarded yearly to market.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1195"></A><A HREF="#fn_1195"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A> In 1883 the other principal towns were fairly prosperous, several of them, as Payson,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1196"></A><A HREF="#fn_1196"><FONT SIZE="1">49</FONT></A> Spanish Fork,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1197"></A><A HREF="#fn_1197"><FONT SIZE="1">50</FONT></A> and Springville,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1198"></A><A HREF="#fn_1198"><FONT SIZE="1">51</FONT></A> having wealth and population sufficient to support a number of schools and churches, a theatre,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1199"></A><A HREF="#fn_1199"><FONT SIZE="1">52</FONT></A> and the inevitable young men's and young women's mutual improvement associations.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1200"></A><A HREF="#fn_1200"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A></p>

In Garfield county, below the junction of the Green and Grand rivers, is first encountered the weird scenery of the Colorado. Toward the south and in San Juan county the traveller, standing on the cliffs that overhang its banks, after making his way over leagues of sandstone, where there is no blade of grass or drop of water, sees below him the stream which Captain C&aacute;rdenas discovered in 1540,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1203"></A><A HREF="#fn_1203"><FONT SIZE="1">56</FONT></A> still gliding peaceably, after a lapse of more than three centuries, through valleys as yet untrodden by man.

<p>of the finest in existence.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1208"></A><A HREF="#fn_1208"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A> Ephraim City, incorporated in 1868,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1209"></A><A HREF="#fn_1209"><FONT SIZE="1">62</FONT></A> contained in 1883 about 2,500 inhabitants, and rivalled the county seat in aggregate wealth, all its citizens being men of means, though none very rich. Among other towns and villages may be mentioned Spring City, nine miles north-east of Ephraim, incorporated in 1870; Mount Pleasant, second to Manti in population, incorporated in 1868; and Fairview, in the northern section of the county, incorporated in 1872, with an area of twenty square miles.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1210"></A><A HREF="#fn_1210"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1864 Albert Lewis and ten other citizens from Manti pitched their tents on a spot later forming a portion of Main street in Richfield, Sevier county, Lewis soon afterward building a hut of cottonwood logs, cedar posts, and mud. During this and the following year it is related that 600 bushels of wheat were harvested from 10 acres of land. In 1865, the settlement being then re&euml;nforced, a canal was made, eleven miles in length, tapping the waters of the Sevier. In this year, also, Sevier county was organized.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1211"></A><A HREF="#fn_1211"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A> After the cessation of Indian raids in 1865-6, of which mention has already been made, other portions were occupied, several villages, among them Salina, Glenwood, Vermilion, and Joseph, being built on the banks of the river.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parowan, the seat of Iron county, south of Sevier, had in 1883 a population of 800, the leading interests being farming and lumbering. Cedar City had about the same number,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1212"></A><A HREF="#fn_1212"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A> and Summit, six miles south-west of Parowan, and Kanarra, formerly in Washington</p>

In Kane county, south of Iron, the first settlement, named Kanab, was established in 1870.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1213"></A><A HREF="#fn_1213"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A> St George, the county seat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1214"></A><A HREF="#fn_1214"><FONT SIZE="1">67</FONT></A> of Washington, and a few miles north of the Arizona line, was in 1886 one of the principal cities in southern Utah, and though built on alkaline sands and artificial soil, was one of the garden spots of the country. In its suburbs was a temple built of red sandstone, and dedicated in 1875, its baptismal font being presented by Brigham.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1215"></A><A HREF="#fn_1215"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In common with all the leading towns of Utah, St George was well supplied with schools, containing in 1883 no less than five school-houses, one of which belonged to the presbyterian mission. At that date there were in the territory 411 district schools,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1216"></A><A HREF="#fn_1216"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A> and the total expenditure for school purposes was in 1879 about $293,500, or some $6 per capita of the school children,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1217"></A><A HREF="#fn_1217"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A> the term lasting on an average little more than four months in the year.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the establishment of schools belonging to other religious denominations, or as they were usually termed in Utah, mission schools, educational results were more satisfactory, and if much was professed, much was actually taught.

<p>episcopal church, the Salt Lake seminary, established by the methodists in 1870, and others founded later by various denominations,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1218"></A><A HREF="#fn_1218"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A> received so much of patronage that it became necessary for the Mormons to bestir themselves in the matter, and there was afterward more efficiency in the school system, private institutions being also founded by the saints, among them the academy at Provo,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1219"></A><A HREF="#fn_1219"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A> and the Brigham Young college at Logan.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1220"></A><A HREF="#fn_1220"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many years a great advantage to Mormon as against gentile schools was the fact that they were allowed to use their meeting-houses for public school purposes. In 1880, when the legislature passed an act creating school districts,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1221"></A><A HREF="#fn_1221"><FONT SIZE="1">74</FONT></A> and authorized a tax for the erection and repair of school buildings, these meeting-houses were constituted legal district schools, though retained for religious purposes, the gentiles, none of whose children, with rare exceptions, attended them, being also axed for this purpose. Hence, legal conflicts arose, the decision of the courts being that Mormon school trustees could not collect such taxes</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The University of Deseret, founded, as we have seen, in 1850, and incorporated the same year,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1223"></A><A HREF="#fn_1223"><FONT SIZE="1">76</FONT></A> the curriculum of which was to include all living languages and sciences, had but a nominal existence until 1869. At the former date there were no efficient private schools in the territory, no public-school law had as yet been passed by the legislature, and there were few competent teachers. As the university</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the autumn of 1867 an educational institute was established by the board, and conducted at the council-house, mainly as a commercial academy,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1229"></A><A HREF="#fn_1229"><FONT SIZE="1">82</FONT></A> until 1869, when classical, scientific, and normal departments were added, though at this date it was in fact rather a high-school than a university.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1230"></A><A HREF="#fn_1230"><FONT SIZE="1">83</FONT></A> Students of</p>

<p>both sexes were admitted, the total attendance in 1870 being 546,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1231"></A><A HREF="#fn_1231"><FONT SIZE="1">84</FONT></A> while in 1884 the number was but 298, the decrease being due to want of sufficient appropriations, suitable buildings,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1232"></A><A HREF="#fn_1232"><FONT SIZE="1">85</FONT></A> and preparatory schools. In 1882 the university included an academic, a normal, and a preparatory department. In the first the courses included elementary mathematics, a little Greek and Latin, and a smattering of ancient, medi&aelig;val, modern, and natural history, physical science, political economy, logic, and English literature. On completing any one course, and keeping only three terms, the student was entitled to a certificate of graduation. In the normal department the curriculum, apart from the theory of teaching, was about the same as in the junior classes of a San Francisco high-school, and in the preparatory department almost identical with the subjects usually taught in the lower grades of a grammar-school.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1233"></A><A HREF="#fn_1233"><FONT SIZE="1">86</FONT></A> Although the standard is somewhat low, it is probable that in the University of Deseret more has been accomplished, at an average cost for each pupil of $50 or $60 a year per capita, than in many similar institutions, where the pretensions were greater and the expense in proportion.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1234"></A><A HREF="#fn_1234"><FONT SIZE="1">87</FONT></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a meeting of the board of regents, held in October 1853, Parley P. Pratt, Heber C. Kimball, and George D. Watt were appointed a committee to prepare a small school-book in characters founded on some new system of orthography, whereby the spelling and pronunciation of the English language might be made uniform and easily acquired. A further object was exclusiveness, a separate people wishing to have a separate language, and perhaps in time an independent literature. After some previous discussion, it was agreed that each regent should prepare an alphabet of his own contrivance and present it to the board. Parley Pratt was in favor of adopting one in which each letter should represent a single sound, but as some of the letters represent no sound except when in combination with other letters, and others are of uncertain sound, depending on such combination, the task would seem a difficult one. Finally, at a session held in December of this year, characters were adopted, under the style of the Deseret alphabet, the number of letters, or rather sounds, being thirty-two, of which the so-called vocal sounds were eleven, including six long, with short sounds to correspond, four double and one aspirate, and twenty-one articulate sounds. Thus the long sound of the letter <i>e</i> in meter was represented by a character resembling the Greek <i>sigma</i> reversed, the double sound of <i>woo</i> in wood by one resembling <i>omega</i>, the aspirate by <i>phi</i>, and the articulate sound of <i>f</i> by <i>rho</i>. While these characters are apparently borrowed from the Greek, this is also the case in the plates</p>

<p>from which the book of Mormon is said to have been translated, where the letters <i>pi</i>, <i>rho</i>, <i>tau</i>, <i>phi</i>, <i>chi</i>, some of them as in manuscript, and others as in printed Greek, can be distinctly traced.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type was ordered, and with a view to durability, made so as to contain neither the top nor tail extensions of the letters. At a meeting of the board of regents, held in March 1854, some of it was presented to the members; and between that date and 1869 were published in the Deseret alphabet a primer, the book of Mormon, and the first book of Nephi. Some attempt was made to introduce into the public schools books thus printed, but without success. The tailless characters, and the monotonous evenness of the lines, made the words difficult to distinguish, and it was found impossible to insure uniform pronunciation and orthography. Within a few years the alphabet fell into disuse, and is now remembered only as a curiosity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1235"></A><A HREF="#fn_1235"><FONT SIZE="1">88</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the university may also be mentioned its library, containing at the close of 1875 about 10,000 volumes, later reserved for the use of students, but for many years open to the public.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1236"></A><A HREF="#fn_1236"><FONT SIZE="1">89</FONT></A> The territorial library, for which, as we have seen, an appropriation was made by congress in 1850, further grants being made by the Utah legislature from time to</p>

At the same date the masonic library, established in 1873, contained nearly 6,000 volumes, the odd-fellows&#8217; about 1,500, and there were smaller libraries in connection with various literary, benefit, secret, and mutual improvement societies.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1238"></A><A HREF="#fn_1238"><FONT SIZE="1">91</FONT></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like citizens of the United States elsewhere, the settlers of Utah have always been patrons of newspapers&#8212;and except that their columns are cumbered with church matters, interesting only to the saints, their journals compare very favorably with others published on the Pacific slope. The news is fairly reliable, but the editorial and other comments must be taken at the reader's own valuation. In freedom from journalistic scandal-mongering, they certainly rank among the foremost, and if sometimes dull, they are never silly or obscene. As a rule, the Mormon journals are less rabid in politics and religion than the gentile newspapers. Of several of the former mention has already been made. In 1867 was first published and issued daily the <i>Deseret Evening News</i>, the weekly having been first issued in 1850. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> first appeared on the 4th of July, 1864, under the parentage of T.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;H. Stenhouse,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1239"></A><A HREF="#fn_1239"><FONT SIZE="1">92</FONT></A> and in 1869 was removed to Ogden, where it expired during that year. The <i>Juvenile Instructor</i>, an illustrated Sunday-school periodical published semi-weekly at Salt Lake City, was established by George Q. Cannon, the first number appearing January 1, 1866. <i>The Salt Lake Daily Herald</i> came into existence in June 1870,</p>

<p>Edward L. Sloan being the first editor. The <i>Woman's Exponent</i>, a semi-monthly woman's-rights paper, was first issued June 1, 1872, under the care of Mrs Louise L. Green Richards, and afterward transferred to Mrs Emeline B. Wells. The <i>Salt Lake Daily Times</i>, a theatrical and advertising sheet of which John C. Graham was editor and proprietor, commenced December 24, 1875, and in March 1881 its publication ceased. The first number of <i>Tullidge's Quarterly Magazine</i> appeared in October 1880. This publication is embellished with steel engravings, and has been favorably received, not only in Utah, but in the eastern states and in England. Considerable sums have been subscribed for the publication therein of city and county histories.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Ogden Junction</i> was first issued as a semiweekly in charge of F. D. Richards on the 1st of January 1870. Mr Richards associated with himself C. W. Penrose, to whom he resigned the editorship, subsequent editors being John Nicholson, Joseph Hall, and Leo Haefli. Soon after its first appearance the paper became a daily and its name was changed to the <i>Ogden Herald</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1240"></A><A HREF="#fn_1240"><FONT SIZE="1">93</FONT></A> The <i>Provo Daily Times</i>, which started into being August 1, 1873, has had a varied experience, being successively called the <i>Provo Tri-Weekly Times</i>, the <i>Utah County Times</i>, the <i>Utah County Advertiser</i>, and the <i>Territorial Inquirer</i>, the last being its present name.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1241"></A><A HREF="#fn_1241"><FONT SIZE="1">94</FONT></A> The <i>Beaver Enterprise</i> was instituted early in 1874, Joseph Field being editor; the <i>Southern Utonian</i> was also published at Beaver City in March 1881, with F.

In addition to the above, and to those already mentioned, numerous daily, weekly, monthly, semi-weekly, and semi-monthly publications were issued at the capital and elsewhere in the territory, some of them having but an ephemeral existence, and some being in existence to-day.

There were also 1,131 in California, 451 in Wyoming, 554 in Montana, 394 in Iowa, 208 in Nebraska, and 260 in New York. These are probably below the actual figures at that date, and certainly much below the figures for 1885. The Bannack stake, in the Snake River country, Idaho, alone contained, for instance, on January 31, 1885, 1,770 souls, being divided into eight wards&#8212;Louisville, Menan, Lyman, Rexburg, Teton, Wilford, Parker, and Salem. The first Mormon who visited the Snake River country with a view to settlement was John R. Poole of Ogden, who went there in Feb. 1879, and on his return reported favorably to Franklin D. Richards. The first family to settle there was that of Jos. C. Fisher, who in March 1879 located at Cedar Buttes Island, being joined soon afterward by Poole and others. <i>Ricks, Banaack Stake</i>, MS., passim. For account of Mormons in Oneida co., see <i>Silver City Avalanche</i>, Sept. 17, 1870, March 27, 1875; in Bear Lake Valley, <i>Bois&eacute; City Statesman</i>, Oct. 16, 1879; for agitation on the polygamy question in Idaho, <i>Id</i>., Sept. 3, 1870, Dec. 6, 19, 1879; <i>Ogden Freeman</i>, Feb. 28, 1879. The first attempt to settle the country bordering on the Little Colorado in Arizona was made in 1873, but the party returned, discouraged by the forbidding aspect of the place. Some three years later missionaries were ordered to make permanent settlements in this region, and at a meeting held at Salt Lake City in January 1876, companies were organized and captains appointed for this purpose. The first teams arrived at the Sunset crossing of the Little Colorado on the 23d of March, and after the brethren had explored the neighborhood, W. C. Allen and his company resolved to form a settlement about 20 miles to the south-east of the crossing, to be named after the captain; Geo. Lake and his band settled on the opposite side of the river, two miles to the south-west of Allen, on a spot which they called Obed, near which were springs and meadow-land; Lot Smith and his company formed a colony three miles north-east of the crossing, at a place which was called Sunset, and Jesse O. Ballinger, with his party, settled about four miles north of the crossing on the west side of the river, the settlement being named Ballinger. The brethren proceeded to plough, construct dams, and put in crops, but encountered many difficulties, the river-bottom being treacherous and full of quicksands. At Obed chills and fever prevailed, the settlers being forced to abandon the place and join the other colonies. In November 1877 a number of proselytes arrived from the southern states in a destitute condition; but <a name="page_694"><font size="1" color="green">p. 694</font></A> though all the camps were scantily supplied, their wants were at once relieved. During this season sufficient grain had been raised to last with economy until the following harvest, and meanwhile other settlements had been started, one 25 miles up the river from Allen, to which was given the name of Woodruff, and one 50 miles south of Woodruff, which was called Forest Dale, the name Ballinger being now changed to Brigham City, and Allen to St Joseph. In this year, also, the colonies of eastern Arizona were divided into two presidencies, those on the Little Colorado being west of the dividing line. According to a stake report, dated Aug. 31, 1878, there were at Sunset 114 souls, at Brigham City 230, at St Joseph and Woodruff each 67, and including other small settlements, a total of 587. The harvest of 1878 was severely damaged by floods, but that of 1879 was a bountiful one. In 1880 the crops again suffered from excessive rains and freshets. <i>Settlements on the Little Colorado</i>. MS. The St Joseph stake at Pima, Ar., was organized in Feb. 1883, the place being first settled in 1879 by families from eastern Arizona. St David was founded in 1878, Philemon C. Merrill being the first settler; Curtis in 1881 by the Curtis family; Graham, so named from the peak a few miles to the south, in 1881; Thatcher, named after Apostle Moses Thatcher, in 1882, by John M. Moody; Central, in the same year, by Joseph Cluff and others; McDonald, named in honor of A. F. McDonald, president of the Maricopa stake, by Henry J. Horne and others; Layton, named after President C. Layton, by John and Adam Welker, Ben. Peel, and a few others. All these settlements are in Arizona. The Mesa settlement, belonging to the Maricopa stake, was founded by companies from Bear Lake co., <i>Id</i>., and S. L. co., Utah. Leaving S. L. City immediately after the death of Brigham Young, they reached Salt River in Jan. 1878, and soon afterward began the construction of a canal to the present site of the town. After a year's labor, only a small stream of water was obtained, barely sufficient for planting gardens, as the ditch was cut through a very difficult formation. The settlers persevered, however, their labors diminishing as their numbers increased, and in 1885 a canal had been built carrying 5,000 inches of water, at a cost of $43,000. Lehi, formerly Jonesville, also near Salt River, was founded in 1877 by a party of 71 settlers. In the autumn of this year a few members of the company became dissatisfied with the location, and set forth for San Pedro River, where they founded the settlement of St David, so named by Prest A. F. McDonald after David Patten, whom the Mormons regard as a martyr. <i>Maricopa Stake</i>, MS. In the Gila Valley the settlers bought squatter claims of Mexicans, and in 1885 had constructed over 60 miles of canals from 8 to 16 feet wide, besides a number of smaller ditches. The soil is a fertile, sandy loam, producing two crops or more a year, excellent for grapes and fruit, and of fair quality for all farm products. Sorghum produces three cuttings from one planting, and lucern is cut five or six times a year. Not more than five per cent of the land is arable, the remainder being grazing-land. <i>Martineau's Settlements in Arizona</i>, MS. For monogamic settlements in Montana, see <i>Galveston News</i>, Dec. 1, 1884. In the fall of 1877 Elder John Morgan led a colony of saints from the southern states to Pueblo, Colorado, where they wintered. In March of the following year, James G. Stuart, being ordered to visit the colonists, found them living as best they could, and working at whatever they could find to do. Mainly through the elder's efforts, two settlements were founded, to which were afterward given the names of Ephraim and Manassa. <i>Stuart's Colonization in Colorado</i>, MS. In 1884 the Mormons established a colony at Las Cruces, Sonora, Mex. At the same time their leaders issued a proclamation stating that no general migration to Mexico was intended.

Mr Smith is now one of the principal farmers in Davis co. Among other prominent men in that county may be mentioned the following: Joseph Barton, a native of St Helens, Lancashire, England, settled at Kaysville, his present home, in 1862, being then only 14 years of age. In 1869 he was elected county surveyor, and since that date has held the appointments of city recorder of Kaysville, county clerk, and prosecuting attorney, the last two of which offices he filled in 1885. In 1884 he was a member of the territorial legislature, and almost throughout his career in Utah has occupied positions of trust, though they have come to him unsought, and somewhat against his will. N.T. Porter, a native of Vermont, was one of the first settlers in Centreville, where he took up his abode in 1849, after suffering all the hardships of the expulsion, and of a long residence at Winter Quarters. Jos. Egbert, a native of Salina co., Ind., was a pioneer, sharing the blanket of Orson Pratt during the jonrney, and driving the first team that entered the valley. John R. Baines of Kaysville, a native of Bedfordshire, England, arrived in Utah with a capital of l0 cents, and afterward accumulated a fortune of $100,000 by farming and traffic. The president of the Davis stake was W. R. Smith, who was for several years a member of the legislature, and for nine years probate judge. He was born in Ontario, Canada.</P>

In 1885 he was the owner of several blocks of business buildings, and was worth about $150,000, being at that date a member of the territorial legislature. In 1880 the city and county built a bridge over the Weber, at a cost of $16,000, and in the same year the city constructed a reservoir on Court-house hill to collect the waters of several small springs which were conveyed in pipes to Main street. <i>Stanford's Ogden</i>, MS., 15-16.

In 1877 an attempt was made to have the book of Mormon printed in Pitman's phonoype, and Orson Pratt started for England for this purpose, but returned at the death of Brigham in August of that year. No further effort was made.</P>

Mr Stevens, a native of Somersetshire, England, came to Utah in 1863, settling two years later at North Ogden, where, and at Ogden City, he has ever since been actively engaged in business. Among other ventures, he has been largely interested in the shipment of produce to the eastern states, forwarding as many as 470 car-loads in a single year. To his enterprise the terminus of the Union Pacific is in no small degree indebted for its recent growth.</P>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with Utah literature may be mentioned Eliza R. Snow, the sister of Apostle Lorenzo Snow, and the second of the seven children of Oliver Snow, a native of Mass., and a farmer by occupation, though one much occupied by public business and holding many responsible positions. While still almost a young girl, Sister Snow commenced writing for various publications, under an assumed signature, and later in life published nine volumes, two of them being of poetry, and several reaching a second edition. Miss Snow was baptized as a Mormon in 1835, and the following year removed to Kirtland, residing in the family of Joseph Smith and teaching his children. After a brief residence at Adam-on-Diahman and Quincy, she repaired to Nauvoo, and, at the expulsion, crossed the Mississippi with the first parties, reaching the valley of Great Salt Lake with Parley P. Pratt's companies. <i>Snow's Autobiog</i>., MS., passim; <i>Richards&#8217; Narr</i>., MS., 116-7; <i>Tullidge's Mag</i>., 116-17.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the press of Utah may be mentioned Chas W. Penrose, who was called to the ministry at the London conference of 1850, being then only in his 18th year. Mr Penrose commenced his literary career as a contributor to the <i>Millennial Star</i>, of which he was editor about 1867, having before that date passed several years in Utah, where, however, he found little encouragement as a journalist. Returning in 1870, he was appointed to the editorial charge of the <i>Ogden Junction</i>, which position he filled for seven years, after which he became editor of the <i>Deseret News</i>. In 1876 he was elected member of the legislature for Weber co., in which body he was for several sessions a tireless worker. Among the measures that he introduced was one to remove the political disabilities of women, which passed both houses, but failed to receive the governor's signature. <i>Tullidge's Mag</i>., ii. 27-30.</P>
