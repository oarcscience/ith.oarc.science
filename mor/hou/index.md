One of the problems with literature about and by Mormons, is that, *pro*
or *con*, there are very few texts without an extreme point of view.
This is one of the few comprehensive histories of 19th century Mormonism
which was written with a center of gravity close to what we moderns call
a 'neutral point of view.' Written by (or under the aegis of) H.H.
Bancroft, the foremost historian of the Western US, this massive book
tells the story of the settlement of what would become the state of
Utah. This is, naturally, closely bound up with the saga of the Mormon
persecution and exodus.

This book draws on a huge library of contemporary sources, which
Bancroft assembled with the help of an army of assistants. Every
statement of fact, every incident mentioned, is backed up in the
extensive footnotes, some stretching across five or six pages. Bancroft
is not afraid to deal with touchy subjects such as the Mountain Meadows
massacre, polygamy, and the quirks of the Mormon leaders. Despite the
neutral stance, Bancroft is not unsympathetic to the Mormons. He praises
them as industrious, sober, and law-abiding people (and to document
that, he carefully adds a huge footnote with a compiled table of crime
statistics, broken down by Mormon/non-Mormon!).

There are also many points of general interest here, such as how Utah
happened to be the first US territory to let women vote, the story of
the Deseret alphabet, and how some seagulls saved the pioneers from
starving. His review of the polygamy issue is extremely relevant to the
debate over acceptable forms of marriage today. This book is required
reading if you want to understand the background of the Mormons. Both
Mormon and 'Gentile' will find a lot to like in this volume.
