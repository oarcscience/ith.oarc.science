    <span class="smallcaps">In</span> 1860 the principal route from the
Missouri to Utah was still the old emigrant-road which had been mainly
used during the Utah and California migrations, and which was traversed
by the army of Utah in 1857. Between Utah and California there were
three principal lines of travel—the northern, the central, and the
southern. The first skirted the upper edge of Great Salt Lake, and
thence after crossing an intervening stretch of desert followed the
valleys of the Humboldt and Carson rivers, being, in fact, almost
identical with the Frémont route of 1845. Notwithstanding its length, it
was still preferred by travellers, as pasture and water were fairly
plentiful, and only two small tracts of desert land were met with. <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[1](#fn_1327.md) The central, better known to the
settlers of Utah by the name of Egan's and to the California-bound
emigrants as the Simpson route, though the two were by no means
coincident, varied but a few miles from the fortieth parallel until
reaching the

<span id="page_752">p. 752</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hastings pass in
the Humboldt Mountains, where it branched off in a south-westerly
direction toward Carson lake and river, and from Carson City south to
Genoa. <span id="fr_1328"></span>[2](#fn_1328.md) The southern route was by
way of the Sevier, Santa Clara, and Virgen rivers, striking the Frémont
trail near Las Vegas, thence partly across desert tracts to the junction
of Indian River and the Colorado, and from that point to San
Bernardino. <span id="fr_1329"></span>[3](#fn_1329.md) On neither of the
last two were grass and water abundant, but the southern route had the
advantage of being rarely blocked with snow, except for the portion of
it that lay between Salt Lake and the Rio Virgen.

    At the close of 1883 there were more than 3,000 miles of common
roadway in Utah, <span id="fr_1330"></span>[4](#fn_1330.md) and 1,143 miles

<span id="page_753">p. 753</span>

of railroad, <span id="fr_1331"></span>[5](#fn_1331.md) of which 297
belonged to the Union Pacific, 150 to the Central Pacific, 386 to the
Denver and Rio Grande, 280 to the Utah Central, and 30 to the Sanpete
Valley.

    In 1854, as we have seen, a memorial was addressed to congress by
the territorial legislature, urging the construction of an overland
railroad. In 1860 a second memorial was presented, to the same
purport, <span id="fr_1332"></span>[6](#fn_1332.md) and though neither of
them was regarded, none rejoiced more heartily over the advent of the
railroad than did the settlers of Utah. They felt now strong enough to
have let in on them the advancing tide of civilization without being
swept away by it. Brigham had long foreseen that the railroad would
bring with it a new and manifest destiny to his people. Being himself a
man of destiny, he quickly adapted himself to the altered condition of
affairs, and declared that he believed in it. As all Utah believed in
Brigham, it followed that his people would do their utmost to help it to
completion. They were for the most part too poor to subscribe money, but
whatever of aid or material their land and labor could supply was
cheerfully furnished.

    In May 1868 a contract was made between Brigham

<span id="page_754">p. 754</span>

and a superintendent of construction on the Union Pacific, for grading
and other work on the road between the head of Echo cañon and the
terminus of the line, yet to be located. At Weber cañon, through which
point it entered the valley, there was much tunnelling, blasting, and
mason-work to be done, including the heavy stone-work of the bridge
abutments. The contract amounted to about $1,000,000, gave employment to
500 or 600 men, and, according to its terms, <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[7](#fn_1333.md) eighty per cent of the payments were
to be made monthly as the work progressed, and the remainder when it was
completed and accepted. As soon as the contract was closed, the
superintendent urged that the work be commenced immediately, promising
that if men and teams were collected he would have the line surveyed and
made ready for them within a few days. On this understanding, workmen
were concentrated at various points on the line, but weeks passed, and
still the line was not surveyed. Many of the sub-contractors were thus
compelled to wait until the cost of their operations was largely
increased by the severity of the weather, and to incur debt from
bankers, merchants, and farmers, who supplied them with funds, goods,
grain, and material, thinking that the money due from the promoters of
the Union Pacific would be promptly paid; but the payments were not made
as specified.

    Notwithstanding these drawbacks, the contracts were faithfully
executed, and it was acknowledged by all railroad men that nowhere on
the line could the grading compare in completeness and finish with the
work done by the people of Utah. Before the last tie was laid, <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[8](#fn_1334.md) all the contracts with the Union and

<span id="page_755">p. 755</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Central Pacific,
including forty miles of road between Ogden and the promontory, had been
completed and accepted; but on the 10th of May, 1869, it was claimed by
the saints that the former company was indebted to them in the sum of
$1,000,000, and the two companies about $1,250,000. Toward the close of
the year John Taylor, Joseph A. Young, and John Sharp <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[9](#fn_1335.md) went eastward, with a view to bringing
the

<span id="page_756">p. 756</span>

matter to an issue, and so vigorously and adroitly did they press their
claim, that, in the absence of funds, rolling stock and material to the
value of $600,000 were assigned to them in payment.

    On the 17th of May, one week after the completion of the
transcontinental railroad, ground was broken near the Weber River for a
line between Ogden and Salt Lake City, to be named the Utah
Central. <span id="fr_1336"></span>[10](#fn_1336.md) The road was built and
equipped mainly with the material and rolling stock transferred from the
Union Pacific; for even at this date there was little money in Utah,
mining and traffic being as yet undeveloped, and the entire floating
currency of the community was probably less than $5,000,000. This, the
pioneer line of Utah, is the only one which has preserved its original
identity, and that it has done so is perhaps due to the fact that it
forms the main connecting link between the route of transcontinental
traffic and the principal distributing point for the country.

    In May 1871 ground was broken at Salt Lake City for the Utah
Southern, <span id="fr_1337"></span>[11](#fn_1337.md) the line being pushed
forward at intervals both north and south through some of the richest
lands in Utah, until, in June 1879, its northern terminus was at
Provo, <span id="fr_1338"></span>[12](#fn_1338.md) and its southern limit
at Juab, 105 miles south of the capital. <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[13](#fn_1339.md) Later

<span id="page_757">p. 757</span>

during this year the Utah Southern Extension was commenced at the latter
point, completed during the following spring as far as Milford, <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[14](#fn_1340.md) and a few weeks later to Frisco, the
location of the Horn Silver mine, its distance from Juab being 138
miles. <span id="fr_1341"></span>[15](#fn_1341.md) In 1881 both these lines
were incorporated with the Utah Central. <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[16](#fn_1342.md)

    The Utah and Northern was organized in 1871, ground being broken at
Brigham City in September of that year, and the road completed to Logan
at the close of January 1873, and to Franklin, Idaho, by way of Ogden,
early in the following year. <span id="fr_1343"></span>[17](#fn_1343.md)
The means for building this line were raised by the people of northern
Utah with great difficulty, and after being maintained for years, first
at a loss and then with meagre returns, it was sold to the Union Pacific
for an insignificant sum, in February 1877, <span
id="fr_1344"></span>[18](#fn_1344.md) extended through Idaho into western
Montana, and in 1883 had become one of its most profitable branches.

    During Emery's administration a bill passed the legislature
authorizing the counties of Salt Lake, Davis, Summit, and Tooele to
issue bonds for the purpose of constructing a road from Coalville to

<span id="page_758">p. 758</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Salt Lake City,
the main object being to obtain a supply of coal at cheaper rates than
was charged for fuel taken from the Wyoming mines of the Union Pacific.
The bill was vetoed by the governor; but in 1880 an effort was made to
build the line by private enterprise, among the subscribers being many
who could ill afford such a venture. Like others of the Utah lines, it
was thus commenced on a slender capital, but through the aid of wealthy
stockholders in the Ontario mine, it was completed as, far as Park City,
a distance of twenty-five miles from Coalville. Soon afterward a
parallel branch, named the Echo and Park City, was built by the Union
Pacific, and in 1883 the control of the former, which was known as the
Utah Eastern, fell into the hands of the latter. <span
id="fr_1345"></span>[19](#fn_1345.md)

    The Salt Lake and Western, fifty-seven miles in length, and later a
branch of the Union Pacific, was built in 1874-5 from Lehi junction, a
mile north of Lehi City, to the Tintic mines. It was at first intended
to push the line through to California, tapping some of the rich mining
districts of Nevada; but this project was abandoned. In 1883 it was used
mainly for hauling gold, silver, and iron ore. <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[20](#fn_1346.md) the Utah and Nevada, first named the
Salt Lake, Sevier Valley, and Pioche Railroad, was commenced in 1872,
the intention being to build the line through the mining and
agricultural lands of the Sevier Valley as far as Pioche, in
south-eastern Nevada. After some twenty miles had been completed, work
was abandoned in 1873, but resumed later, and the road completed as far
as Stockton, in Tooele county, its terminus in 1883, at which date it
was also under control of the Union Pacific. On account of the failure
of the Pioche mines, and for other reasons, there seems little prospect
of the original project being executed. The Sanpete Valley Railroad,
built in 1880, between Nephi, in Juab

<span id="page_759">p. 759</span>

county, and Wales, in Sanpete county, its length being thirty miles, was
constructed by an English company for the purpose of securing a market
for the output of its coal mines. <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[21](#fn_1347.md)

    The Denver and Rio Grande Western, the Utah division of the Denver
and Rio Grande system of railroads, first began work here in 1881, and
in 1883 had 386 miles of road in operation, running through Emery, Utah,
Salt Lake, Davis, and a portion of Weber counties, with branch lines
named the Little Cottonwood and Bingham Cañon, the former running east
into the Wasatch Mountains and the latter west into the Oquirrh Range,
both being built solely to facilitate mining operations. <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[22](#fn_1348.md) Ninety miles of the Denver and Rio
Grande Western were built entirely by local enterprise, including fifty
miles of the main line extending through Spanish Fork cañon, completed
by the citizens of Springville, and first known as the Utah and Pleasant
Valley Railroad. <span id="fr_1349"></span>[23](#fn_1349.md)

    During the years immediately preceding the completion of the
overland railroad, the imports of Utah seldom exceeded 12,000 tons,
while the exports were of trifling amount. Commerce with the east and
west was entirely insignificant, supplies being drawn mainly from St
Louis and San Francisco, and paid for in part with the money received
for surplus grain, stock, and garden produce from passing emigrants,
who, together with the soldiery and the stage lines, furnished almost

<span id="page_760">p. 760</span>

the principal cash receipts of Utah. <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[24](#fn_1350.md) In 1871 the volume of domestic
imports and exports had increased to 80,000 tons, and since that date
has averaged about 125,000 tons, of which two thirds were imports, and
nearly one half consisted of material needed for mining operations.

    The total value of imports for 1882 was estimated at $11,410,000,
and of exports at $11,525,000, the chief items among the former being
dry goods, groceries, clothing, lumber and other building material,
agricultural implements, leather and leathern manufactures; among the
latter, gold, silver, lead, copper matte, live-stock, beef, wool, hides,
pelts, furs, and tallow, <span id="fr_1351"></span>[25](#fn_1351.md) the
exports of metals alone amounting to $9,000,000. The shipment of iron
ore and charcoal to Utah, which at one time were important factors in
the imports, has now practically ceased; but the territory must always
import more or less of lumber, agricultural implements, wagons, and
furniture; for there are no hard or finishing woods of native growth,
and lumber of good quality cut from native timber is scarce and
difficult to obtain. Imports of leathern and woollen goods will
doubtless decrease with the growth of manufactures, though for reasons
that are explained elsewhere, the leather produced in Utah is of
inferior quality.

    While Utah could without difficulty produce a large surplus of many
agricultural products, distance from market and an exorbitant freight
tariff make it almost impossible for her to compete with the Pacific and
western states. Several efforts have been made in this direction, but
the results were not satisfactory, and it is doubtful whether Utah has
yet sent away in all more than 1,000,000 bushels of grain. The
experiment

<span id="page_761">p. 761</span>

was first tried on a large scale in 1878, when a ship was laden at San
Francisco with 64,000 bushels of Utah wheat, the cargo being sold before
the vessel put to sea. A few months later a ship was chartered for
England with 78,000 bushels, <span id="fr_1352"></span>[26](#fn_1352.md)
but though a small profit was realized, it was not sufficient to
encourage further operations.

    If to the $11,410,000 of imports there be added 25 per cent as the
profits of jobbers and retailers, we have a total of about $14,250,000,
which represents approximately the general business of Utah. It is
worthy of note that while this large amount of business is transacted,
the average number of failures for the eight years ending 1883 did not
exceed fourteen, with liabilities averaging about $11,000. <span
id="fr_1353"></span>[27](#fn_1353.md) The credit of Utah merchants is for
the most part exceptionally good; not that they are considered more
upright than other merchants, but because a very large proportion of
cash is now employed in their transactions; and while many import on a
small scale, the bulk of the business is done by a few large firms,
which trade on a sufficient capital and do not require much credit.

    In 1883 it was estimated that the Zion's Coöperative Mercantile
Institution, with its 800 stockholders, its cash capital of $1,000,000,
its surplus of $150,000, and its branches at Ogden and Logan, imported
at least one third of all the merchandise consumed in Utah. Soon after
this association was established, coöperative stores were opened in
every large town, and in nearly every village and farming settlement,
all of them purchasing from the so-called parent institution, and
through its agency disposing of the produce received in barter. Every
one who could purchase or earn a share of stock contributed his labor or
capital, and though many of them succumbed through opposition or
over-anxiety to disburse

<span id="page_762">p. 762</span>

large dividends, it is probable that at least two thirds of the settlers
patronize them at this day. <span id="fr_1354"></span>[28](#fn_1354.md)

    The progress and development of trade in Utah froth the days of
1848, when probably the entire cash capital of the community did not
amount to $3,000, present some interesting and anomalous features. At
first, as we have seen, the Mormons desired to avoid all traffic with
the outside world; but as emigrants passed over their roads and through
their settlements, goods were exchanged with advantage to both sides. It
was not until two years after the pioneers entered the valley that the
first store was opened at an adobe house, in the seventeenth ward of
Salt Lake City, by the firm of Livingston & Kinkead, <span
id="fr_1355"></span>[29](#fn_1355.md) whose stock was worth some $20,000.
In 1850 the firm of Holliday & Warner established a branch of their
business in the capital, through their agent, William H. Hooper, who
opened a store in a building erected for school purposes, on the block
occupied by Brigham Young, thence removing to the structure later
occupied by the museum. <span id="fr_1356"></span>[30](#fn_1356.md)

    Soon the unerring scent of commerce discovered the direction which
business must take, and Main

<span id="page_763">p. 763</span>

street, then dubbed Whiskey street, the denizens of which were often
rebuked in the tabernacle for their iniquities, rapidly became the
business quarter of the city, John and Enoch Reese, the third firm in
historic date, building a store on the ground later occupied by the
express office, and J M. Horner & Co., the fourth, occupying a portion
of the premises of the *Deseret News*. <span
id="fr_1357"></span>[31](#fn_1357.md) Among the men who had become
prominent at the time of the Utah war were Gilbert & Gerrish and William
Nixon, the latter being still termed the father of Utah merchants. <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[32](#fn_1358.md)

    Before the Utah war and for several years afterward, internal trade
was conducted mainly by barter and the due-bill system. At this period
the settlers had little use for money, and preferred taking in exchange
for their commodities something that they could eat, or drink, or wear,
and which could not be had at home. Thus scores of well-to-do farmers,
with families to clothe and educate, while living in greater comfort
perhaps than those of the western or Pacific states, seldom possessed a
dollar in coin. Should one of them, for instance, require clothing for
wife or child, he consulted the store-keeper, who agreed, perhaps, to
supply him for so many loads of wood. If he should have no spare wood,
he searched out some neighbor who had a surplus and offered him its
equivalent in butter or poultry. Perhaps, however, this neighbor did not
need butter or poultry, but required a few loads of gravel or adobes. In
that case the farmer must find some one who was willing to exchange

<span id="page_764">p. 764</span>

for his poultry or butter, gravel or adobes, which he delivered in
return for wood, hauled the wood to the store, and thus, at length, wife
and child were clad. For the tuition of his children he would pay,
perhaps, so many dozens of eggs per quarter; for admission to the
theatre, a score of cabbages; for the services of a laborer or mechanic,
a certain number of watermelons per day; and his tithes were usually,
but not always, paid in kind.

    In this primitive fashion, until the advent of the railroad, trade
was for the most part conducted in Utah; and notwithstanding the wisdom
and economic system of their rulers, there were times, as will be
remembered, when the settlers were really needy. The country was
relieved only by a train of fortunate, or as the settlers believed
providential, circumstances. These were, first, the presence of the army
of Utah, which after disbursing large sums among the community sold them
its substance at nominal rates; second, the arrival of a second army
under Colonel Connor, with the interchange of traffic and demand for
labor thereby occasioned; third, the needs of the overland mail and
telegraph lines.

    In part through such adventitious aid, the merchants of Utah,
putting forth their might, built up a commerce as wonderful in its
growth and development as that of any of the states on the Atlantic or
Pacific seaboard. As early as 1864 there were several houses in Salt
Lake City that purchased in New York, St Louis, or Chicago goods to the
value of $250,000 or more at a time, among them being William
Jennings, <span id="fr_1359"></span>[33](#fn_1359.md) Godbe & Mitchell, the
Walker Brothers,

<span id="page_765">p. 765</span>

and Kimball & Lawrence, than whom few firms throughout the United
States, outside, perhaps, of Boston, ranked higher as to commercial
integrity. After the founding of Zion's Coöperative Mercantile
Institution, mentioned elsewhere, and the development of its banking
system, the trade and commerce of Utah assumed a more homogeneous
character. <span id="fr_1360"></span>[34](#fn_1360.md)

 

    In 1883 there were twelve private and five national banks in
operation in Utah, of which six were at the capital, three at Ogden, two
at Logan, and one each at the several towns of Provo, Corinne, St
George, Richfield, Silver Reef, and Park City. Their aggregate paid-up
capital was estimated at $1,000,000, their loans at $3,000,000, their
deposits at $3,500,000, and the amount of their exchange business at
from $12,000,000 to $15,000,000. <span
id="fr_1361"></span>[35](#fn_1361.md)

<span id="page_766">p. 766</span>

    At this date there were some fifty insurance agencies having
business with Salt Lake City and Ogden, their risks on buildings
amounting to $500,000, and on merchandise in stock to $3,500,000. <span
id="fr_1362"></span>[36](#fn_1362.md)

    Thus with her 1,143 miles of railroad, her agricultural and
stock-raising interests, now valued at $12,000,000 a year, her
manufactures at $5,000,000, her mining output at $7,000,000 or
$8,000,000, her commerce at $23,000,000, and her seventeen national and
commercial banks, it will be seen that Utah compares

<span id="page_767">p. 767</span>

not unfavorably with the states of the Pacific slope. She is practically
free from debt, and nowhere is taxation lighter or more equitably
adjusted. In 1865, as we have seen, the territorial and county taxes
were not allowed in any case to exceed one per cent of the assessed
value of property, while for school purposes they seldom exceeded one
fourth of one per cent. <span id="fr_1363"></span>[37](#fn_1363.md) In 1883
the rate was but six mills on the dollar for both territorial and school
purposes, <span id="fr_1364"></span>[38](#fn_1364.md) counties being
allowed discretion as to their rate of levy, provided that it should
never exceed six mills on the dollar. <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[39](#fn_1365.md) Cities were limited to five mills on
the dollar for municipal expenses, and five mills for the making and
repair of streets. The assessed value of all property in the territory
was, in 1883, $30,834,425, <span id="fr_1366"></span>[40](#fn_1366.md) and
this was considerably less than 50 per cent of the real value, the total
revenue from territorial and school tax being $185,000, <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[41](#fn_1367.md) or little more than $1 per capita of
the population. That this sum was expended economically for the public
benefit is shown by the number of public buildings, roads, bridges, and
other improvements in the cities and counties of Utah. <span
id="fr_1368"></span>[42](#fn_1368.md)

<span id="page_768">p. 768</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This amount does
not of course include the income from tithes, which in 1880 was
estimated at $458,000, <span id="fr_1369"></span>[43](#fn_1369.md) a sum
not larger in proportion to population than is expended for religious
and charitable purposes in other states and territories of the union.

    The receipts of the United States internal revenue from Utah were
for 1883 about $48,000, and for the twenty preceding years averaged
about $40,000. Neither tobacco nor spirituous liquors were manufactured
in the country, though 230,000 cigars and some 18,000 barrels of malt
liquors made during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1883, yielded
revenue to the amount of $18,097. Apart from these items, most of the
internal revenue receipts were derived from license taxes. <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[44](#fn_1370.md)

 

    The United States land-office at Salt Lake City was opened in the
year 1869. Up to the 31st of March, 1884, the total payments made
through this office were $831,209.08, this amount representing almost
the entire sum paid for lands disposed of by government. During this
period 6,388 homestead entries were made, covering an area of 844,159
acres, and 2,773 final proofs. The number of mineral-land entries was
1,023, and their area 8,656 acres; of coal-land entries 72, with an area
of 10,423 acres. <span id="fr_1371"></span>[45](#fn_1371.md)

<span id="page_769">p. 769</span>

    The receipts of the post-office at Salt Lake City for the year
ending March 31, 1884, amounted to $39,294, and the expenses to $12,871,
leaving a surplus in this department of $26,423. The first post-office
was established in March 1849, letters being usually delivered before
that date at the conclusion of divine service on the sabbath at the
several places of worship. Of mail contracts and services up to the
close of 1856 mention has already been made. <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[46](#fn_1372.md) At that date, it will be remembered,
there was a monthly service, when not interrupted by severity of weather
or unforeseen casualties, connecting eastward with Independence and
westward with Sacramento. After the reopening of postal communication,
interrupted by the Utah war, there was little regard to regularity or
promptness in the delivery of the mails, letters and papers being often
lost, mail-bags wetted, thrown carelessly to the ground, and sometimes
purposely destroyed.

<span id="page_770">p. 770</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> As for magazines
and newspapers, the saints considered themselves fortunate if they
received them four months after date. The establishment of the pony
express in 1860, and the persistence with which the Mormons advertised
their grievances, improved matters considerably; and with the building
of railroads, lines of postal route were of course established
throughout the territory. In 1879 there were 109 routes, the subsidies
for which amounted to nearly $200,000 <span
id="fr_1373"></span>[47](#fn_1373.md) and about 200 postmasters, whose
compensation varied from 18 cents to $2,800 a year. <span
id="fr_1374"></span>[48](#fn_1374.md)

    On October 18, 1861, a message from Brigham Young was received by
the president of the Pacific Telegraph Company at Cleveland, Ohio, of
which the following is a portion: "Utah has not seceded, but is firm for
the constitution and laws of our once happy country." <span
id="fr_1375"></span>[49](#fn_1375.md) The message was courteously answered.
the same day Secretary and Acting Governor Frank Fuller thus saluted
President Lincoln: "Utah, whose citizens strenuously resist all
imputations of disloyalty, congratulates the president upon the
completion of an enterprise which spans a continent…May the whole system
speedily thrill with the quickened pulsations

<span id="page_771">p. 771</span>

of the heart, as the parricide hand is palsied, treason is punished, and
the entire sisterhood of states join hands in glad reunion around the
national fireside." The president answered: "The government reciprocates
your congratulations." <span id="fr_1376"></span>[50](#fn_1376.md) In the
autumn of this year the line was completed westward to California. <span
id="fr_1377"></span>[51](#fn_1377.md) The charge for messages to New York
was in 1861 at the rate of $7.50 for 10 words, as against $1.50 in
1880. <span id="fr_1378"></span>[52](#fn_1378.md)

    At the former date Brigham had already resolved to connect the
leading settlements of Utah by means of a home telegraph system. It was
not, however, until the autumn of 1865 that the matter was brought
prominently before the people. They responded cheerfully and promptly,
as they ever did to his behests, contributing funds and labor, and about
a year later the Deseret Telegraph Co. was in operation, the line
opening for business in December 1866, connecting first with Ogden, and
soon afterward with Brigham City and Logan, its northern terminus. In
January 1867, 500 miles of wire had been laid, extending northward to
Cache Valley and southward to St George, with a branch line running
through Sanpete Valley. <span id="fr_1379"></span>[53](#fn_1379.md) During
this month the company was organized under charter from the legislature,
with a capital of $500,000. <span id="fr_1380"></span>[54](#fn_1380.md) The
line was afterward continued

<span id="page_772">p. 772</span>

through Sevier county to Monroe, and from Toquerville to the Kanab
country in south-eastern Utah, to Tintic, Cottonwood, and Bingham, and
to Pioche and other towns in south-eastern Nevada. In 1880 it had been
further extended to Paris, Idaho, to the mining towns of Frisco, Silver
City, and Alta, and toward the south-east as far as Ordenville, touching
Arizona in its route. At this date there were 955 miles of pole line,
1,130 of wire, and 68 offices in operation. The capital stock was held
entirely by Mormons, and though much of the route lay through a sparsely
settled country, where the expenses were out of all proportion to the
receipts, the enterprise was self-supporting. <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[55](#fn_1381.md)

    In 1882 there were 2,647 miles of telegraph and 600 of telephone
wire, with 560 instruments in Utah, <span
id="fr_1382"></span>[56](#fn_1382.md) and communication with the adjacent
states and territories was being rapidly pushed forward.

 

    The people of the United States seem now determined that polygamy
shall be suppressed. During the years 1885-7, fines and imprisonments
were of constant occurrence, and hundreds of heads of families went into
hiding. Some voluntarily came forward, gave themselves up, and stood
their trial. Whether or not the system is destined thus to be wholly
rooted out, it is impossible to say. But in answer to the

<span id="page_773">p. 773</span>

oft-repeated accusations of those who regard the Mormons merely as an
ulcer in the body politic, there are many points which to the impartial
observer would seem worthy of being noted in their favor. Laying aside
the questions of religion and polygamy, we find recorded in their annals
one of the greatest achievements of modern times, and one that sheds a
lustre on the dark cloud which, to gentile gaze, hangs like a
funeral-pall over the genius of this singular and long-suffering
community. Driven from Far West, from Kirtland, from Nauvoo, they found
at length, amid the farthest west, an abiding-place—one then as remote
from civilization as the wilds of Senegambia. There, within forty years,
has been established a thriving community; there has been built one of
the most sightly capitals west of the Mississippi, an oasis amid the
great American desert, and with hundreds of settlements depending upon
it. There farms and orchards, flocks and herds, factories and
warehouses, cover the formerly unpeopled solitude, abandoned but a few
decades ago to the savage, the coyote, and the wolf. The men and women
who compose this community, drawn for the most part from the lower
strata of European society, have not been slow to learn the practical
lessons which their church has taught them; to learn how to exercise
forethought, frugality, and other qualities which lead to success in
life. <span id="fr_1383"></span>[57](#fn_1383.md)

Simpson of the topographical engineers received instructions from Gen.
Johnson to explore the great basin, with a view to find a direct wagon
route from Camp Floyd to Genoa, in Carson Valley· An account of the
expedition will be found in his *Rept Explor. Gt Basin*. For about 300
miles his route was identical with Egan's, except for a few unimportant
deviations; but soon after reaching Ruby Valley it tended more toward
the south. Egan's line was preferred, however, as on the one taken by
Simpson grass and water were scarce. Howard Egan, a major in the Nauvoo
legion, and a well-known guide and mountaineer, was for some years
engaged in driving stock to Cal. in the service of Livingston & Kinkead,
and afterward became a mail agent. *Burton's City of the Saints*, 550.

bridges, for which see *Utah Jour. Legisl*. and *Utah Laws*, passim. In

<span id="fn_1331"></span>[753:5](hou31.htm#fr_1331.md) In 1860 there was a
weekly stage to S. L. City, conducted by Russell & Waddell, who during
the same year started a pony express. In 1861 they were bought out by
Ben Holliday, and in that or the following year a daily line was
established to S. L. City. In 1866 Wells, Fargo, & Co. purchased
Holliday's interest, believing that the railroad would not be completed
for six or seven years. They lost by the transaction, among their
purchases being $70,000 worth of new coaches which they never used, and
afterward sold to Gilmer & Salisbury for one fourth of the cost. John T.
Gilmer commenced staging in 1859 under Russell & Waddell. In 1864 he was
appointed division agent at Bitter Creek by Ben Holliday. About 1876 he
began mining in the Black Hills, Utah, and afterward in Nev., Id.,
Ariz., and Cal. He was also connected with the Stewart mine in Bingham
cañon, and others. In 1884 he was conducting a staging business in Utah,
Id., Ariz., and Cal. *Gilmer's Mails and Staging in Utah*, MS.

opening of the railroad will be found in almost every book that treats

S. L. City on the completion of the railroad, see *Deseret News*, May

account of which is given in *Id*., March 8, 1869; *Tullidge's Mag*., i.
476-7. <span id="page_755">p. 755</span> In 1868 Gen. Connor built and
launched a small steamer, named the *Kate Connor*, for carrying railroad
ties and telegraph poles from the southern to the northern shore of the
G. S. Lake. *Res. and Attract. of Utah*, 63. The ties were for the Union
Pacific. This appears to have been the first steamer that navigated the
lake, though in the *S. F. Bulletin*, July. 29, 1856, it is stated that
there was one at that date. In 1869 an excursion steamer was built, and
in 1870 a boat costing $45,000, first named the *City of Corinne* and
then the *General Garfield*. In 1879 the latter was still used mainly
for excursions, as there was little freight to be had. At this date
there was a considerable yachting fleet on the lake, the first, and for
some years the only yacht, being built by the Walker Bros. For
description of excursions on G. S. Lake in 1879, see *Marshall's Through
Amer*., 191; for navigation on the Colorado in 1865, *Austin Reese River

<span id="fn_1335"></span>[755:9](hou31.htm#fr_1335.md) Bishop Sharp, known
in Utah also as the railroad bishop, was born in 1820 at the Devon
iron-works, Scotland, and when eight years of age went to work in a
coal-pit. In 1847, being then a coal-miner in Clackmannanshire, he was
converted to Mormonism, and the following year sailed for New Orleans
with his two brothers, who had also joined the faith. They reached S. L.
City in 1850. Here Sharp was first employed in quarrying stone for the
tabernacle and tithing-office, and was soon afterward made
superintendent of the quarry. In 1854 he was ordained a bishop, and ten
years later was appointed assistant superintendent of public works. When
the contract was made with the Union Pacific by Brigham, as above
mentioned, Sharp was one of the principal sub-contractors. In 1871 he
became superintendent of the Utah Central, and in 1873 president, having
previously been elected vice-president of the Utah Southern. While
employed as purchasing agent for the latter company in the eastern
states, he became associated with the directors of the Union Pacific, by
whom he was afterward elected a member of the board. Among those who
were awarded contracts by the Central Pacific was Lorin Farr, who, with
Benson and West as partners, graded 200 miles of the road, Aaron F. Farr
being employed as superintendent. Lorin Farr also took an active part in
the building of the Utah Central and Utah Northern, of which more later,
and was one of the prime movers in bringing the Denver and Rio Grande
into Ogden. In 1868 he built the Ogden woollen-mills in conjunction with
Randall Pugsley and Neil, and for 20 years was mayor of that city. Aaron
F. Farr was for six years probate judge of Weber co., and was elected a
member of the Utah legislature.

    In connection with the Central Pacific may be mentioned the name of
James Forbes, their agent at Ogden between 1869 and 1884, and in
connection with the Union Pacific, A. G. Fell, at the latter date
superintendent of division in the same city. Forbes, a native of Conn.,
came to Cal. when 16 years of age, and after being engaged in mining for
several years, was appointed agent for the C. P. R. R. at Elko, Nev.,
soon after the line was opened, removing thence to Utah a few months
later. Fell, a native of Ontario, Can., and in 1867 employed in the
train-despatcher's office at Montreal, also removed to Utah in 1867.

    Joshua R. Nichols, appointed assist super. U. P. R. R. in July 1869,
says <span id="page_XXX">p. XXX</span> that for three months after that
date no director or manager dare travel on the line without a
body-guard. *Nichols' Mining Mach*., MS.

Christ. Layton, forming the board of directors. The original capital was
$1,500,000, divided into 15,000 shares of $100 each. It does not appear
that the directors had much faith in the undertaking, for none of them,
except Brigham, subscribed for more than twenty shares, while Layton
took only 10, and Little 5 shares. For celebration when ground was

down. In the *Deseret News* of Sept. 28, 1854, it is stated that Capt.
Grant of Fort Hall was the first outsider who brought goods to the Utah
market for sale, offering sugar and coffee at $1 a pint, calico at 50 to
75 cents a yard, and other articles in proportion. Livingston & Kinkead,
who came with the intention of trading for five years, realizing a
certain net profit, and then returning to Egypt, which they did, sold
coffee and sugar at 40 cents a pound (a little more than a pint), calico
at 25 cents a yard, etc. At this date there were few eastern, or, as
they were termed, states goods in the market; and if we can believe
*Beadle's Life in Utah*, 197, the firm took in $10,000 in gold the first
day their store was opened. As this amount then probably represented
almost the entire floating capital of the Mormons, the statement must be
taken for what it is worth.

<span id="fn_1356"></span>[762:30](hou31.htm#fr_1356.md) In 1851 David
Smith and E. N. Cook, bound for Oregon with a large band of stock from
St Joseph, stopped at Salt Lake City for three weeks, trading dry goods,
etc., for additional cattle. *Clark's Sights*, MS., 11.

<span id="fn_1357"></span>[763:31](hou31.htm#fr_1357.md) Horner & Co.
reduced the price of sugar to three pounds for $1, whereupon Livingston
& Kinkead sold it at 30 ccnts a pound, calico at 18 3/4 cents a yard,
and marked all their goods 25 per cent below former prices, giving a
guarantee never to exceed these rates. *Deseret News*, Sept. 28, 1854.
In 1855, however, coffee and moist sugar were still selling at 40 cents
per lb., and domestics at 25 cents a yard, tea being worth $2.25 per
lb., flour $6.25 per 100 lbs., bacon and cheese each 30 cents, and
butter 36 to 40 cents. *Chandler's Visit to S. Lake*, 345. Horner & Co.
continued but a short time in business, being succeeded by Hooper &
Williams.

<span id="fn_1358"></span>[763:32](hou31.htm#fr_1358.md) Gilbert & Gerrish
were a gentile firm, and William Nixon was a Mormon of English descent,
who began his commercial career at St Louis. Among his pupils were the
Walker brothers.

<span id="fn_1359"></span>[764:33](hou31.htm#fr_1359.md) Isaac, the father
of William Jennings, a wealthy butcher of Yardley, Worcester, England,
was better known to fame as one of the claimants in the Jennings
chancery suit, in which millions of pounds were at stake; but though he
proved himself a lawful claimant, his efforts won for him no substantial
result. In 1847 William Jennings, then some 14 years of age, took ship
for New York, where, during the ensuing winter, he was employed by a
pork-packer at a wage of $6 a week. After some adventures, being at one
time robbed of his all and glad to find work as a journeyman butcher,
and on another occasion attacked with cholera, which left him with a
shattered constitution and $200 in debt, he chanced to make the
acquaintance of a catholic <span id="page_765">p. 765</span> priest,
from whom he borrowed $50. With this capital Jennings made his first
real start in life, and turning every dollar to account, soon paid off
his debt and laid the basis of his fortune. In 1851 we find him at St
Joseph, where he was married to Jane Walker, a Mormon emigrant girl. In
the autumn of 1852 he arrived at Salt Lake City, having first invested
all his means in three wagon-loads of groceries, from which he realized
a considerable profit. Joining the church, he engaged in business as a
butcher, and in 1855-6 as a tanner, boot and shoe manufacturer, and
saddle and harness maker. In 1856 he was sent on a mission to Carson
Valley, and, returning in the summer of 1857, commenced business some
three years later as a dry-goods merchant in Salt Lake City, soon
becoming the leading business man in Utah. In 1864 his purchases in New
York and St Louis amounted to $500,000, and in Salt Lake City to
$350,000, his business thereafter averaging about $2,000,000 per annum.
Mr Jennings assisted in organizing the Utah Central R. R., of which he
became vice-president, and succeeded Brigham as president of the Utah
Southern. He was also one of the founders and directors of the Deseret
National Bank, and a member of the legislature under Governor Doty.

<span id="fn_1360"></span>[765:34](hou31.htm#fr_1360.md) Until the advent
of the railroad, the prices of all commodities continued extremely high.
At a convention held at the Bowery, S. L. City, Oct. 4, 1864, the price
of flour was fixed at $12 her 100 lbs of wheat corn and beans at $5, $4,
and $10 per bushel respectively, of pork at 30 cents, and of dried
apples at 75 cents per lb., all in gold. *Deseret News*, Oct. 19, 1864.
Bowles says that in June of the following year lumber was worth $100 per
thousand feet, sugar 75 to 85 cents, coffee $1 to $1.10 and tea 3.50 to
$5 per lb. *Across the Continent*, 101-2. These prices were in currency.

<span id="fn_1361"></span>[765:35](hou31.htm#fr_1361.md) *Utah Gazetteer*,
1884, 115. The firm of Hooper, Eldredge, & Co.—W. H. Hooper, H. S.
Eldredge, and L. S. Hills—commenced business at S. L. City May 1, 1869,
with a capital of $40,000. They were succeeded by the Bank of Deseret,
incorporated under territorial law Sept. 1, 1871, with a capital of
$100,000, Brigham Young being president, H. S. Eldredge vice-president,
and W. H. Hooper, W. Jennings, F. Little, and J. Sharp the remaining
directors. L. S. Hills was cashier. this institution was again succeeded
by the Deseret National Bank, organized under the act of Nov. 1, 1872,
<span id="page_763">p. 763</span> with a capital of $200,000, and with
the same directors and officials, its deposits in 1880 being about
$500,000. the Walker Bros' bank was established in 1871, the firm having
at that date large deposits of cash and bullion to their credit,
notwithstanding the losses caused by the coöperative movement and by the
opposition of the church dignitaries. *Walker's Merchants and Miners of
Utah*, MS., 4. The remaining banks at S. L. City in 1873 were those of
Jones & Co., McCornick & Co., Wells, Fargo, & Co., and the Zion's
Savings Bank, the last having a capital of $50,000, and of which John
Taylor was president.

    The Ogden banks were the Commercial National Bank, the Utah National
Bank of Ogden, and the First National, of which last H. S. Eldredge was
president in 1885. The business of the Commercial National was purchased
from J. M. Langsdorf and H. O. Harkness, the former organizing the firm
of J. W. Guthrie & Co. at Corinne in 1874. J. M. Langsdorf, a native of
Pittsburg, Pa, came to Utah in 1869. His first occupation was to sweep
out the bank at Corinne, of which he was soon made book-keeper, and
afterward manager. *Langsdorf's Stock-raising in Weber Co*., MS. Guthrie
& Co.'s business afterward fell into the hands of R. M. Dooly, by whom
the Utah National Bank of Ogden was organized in 1883. Dooly, a native
of Ill., came to Cal. in 1872, removing to Utah the following year, and
being employed by Wells, Fargo, & Co. until Oct. 1881. In 1878 he was
married to Mary Eliza Helfrich, a native of Grass Valley, Cal. *Dooly's
Ogden Banks*, MS. Among the bankers of Ogden may also be mentioned
Watson N. Shilling, a native of Ohio, where he was born in 1840.
Removing to Michigan when he was twelve years of age, he enlisted in
1861 in the 1st Michigan cavalry, serving throughout the war, and being
mustered out, in 1865, at Fort Collins, Col. Two years later he
proceeded to Oneida co., Id., where he engaged in farming, trading, and
stock-raising, and where in 1884 he still retained his interests, his
residence in Ogden being mainly with a view to the education of his
family. In 1883 he was a delegate to the national republican convention,
throwing in his influence to secure the nomination of Blaine. *Utah
Biog. Sketches*, MS., 56. The Logan banks were those of Charles Frank
and Thatcher Bros & Co., the latter having a capital of $75,000. The
bank at Provo was named the First National, its capital being $50,000,
with A. O. Smoot as president; the one at St George was conducted by
Woolley, Lund, & Judd; the one at Richfield by Jas M. Peterson; and the
one at Silver Reef by R. T. Gillespie. For further particulars

Ogden opened the first fire-insurance agency in Utah. Mr Daul, a native

for the most part employed as a missionary until 1873.

<span id="fn_1367"></span>[767:41](hou31.htm#fr_1367.md) Mines and mining
products were exempt, though machinery and improvements were liable to
taxation. The county assessors were allowed to make their own standard,
the result being that the tax was but 20 to 50 per cent of the cash
valuation. Thus a steer was valued in one county at $15, in another at
$6 or $8, whereas the cash value of cattle was in 1883 $25 to $30 per
head. Roads bonded at $20,000 per mile were assessed at about $2,000,
and others in the same proportion, the rate never exceeding one sixth of
the indebtedness.

Returning to Utah in 1857, he took an active part in promoting the home
industries of the territory; he was also travelling agent of the church,
assisted in emigration matters, temple building, the coöperative
movement, and was, in brief, one of Brigham's most trustworthy agents.

Taylor was president, Dan. H. Wells vice-president, Jas Jack treasurer,
and W. B. Dougall secretary, all of them being directors. The other
members of the board were John Sharp, F. Little, Ed. Hunter, H. P.
Kimball, and Geo. Reynolds. Musser having resigned the superintendency
in 1876, Dougall was appointed in his stead. *Id*. In 1878 the wires

<span id="fn_1383"></span>[773:57](hou31.htm#fr_1383.md) I give herewith
some further biographical notices. Orson Hyde, a native of Oxford,
Conn., was born in 1805, commenced life by working in an iron-foundery
for six dollars a month, afterward serving for a year or two as clerk to
the firm of Gilbert & Whitney of Kirtland. While at Kirtland, Hyde, who
was then a stanch methodist, and a class-leader in a camp-meeting at
that point, heard that a golden bible had been dug out of a rock in the
state of New York. A few months later he was converted to Mormonism, and
set forth as a missionary, being a member of the English mission of
1837, when he was accompanied by Heber C. Kimball, Willard Richards, and
others. In 1840 he went to Jerusalem, where he held service at the mount
of Olives, and consecrated the holy land, being appointed to this duty
by the prophet, who declared him to be of the house of Judah. After the
prophet's assassination, he again proceeded, in company with Parley
Pratt and John Taylor, to Great Britain, where he set the churches in
order, having now been chosen one of the twelve. He arrived at Winter
Quarters a few weeks after the departure of the pioneer band, and on
their return labored to reorganize the first presidency, Brigham Young
being appointed Joseph's successor, partly by his efforts. After the
saints were gathered in Utah, he <span id="page_774">p. 774</span>
remained in that territory as presiding apostle at various settlements,
maintaining robust health until about his 70th year, and continuing to
labor in the ministry until his decease in November 1878. For further
details, see *Autobiog. of Mrs M. A. P. Hyde,* MS., 4; *Hyde's Travels

    Edward Hunter, a native of Newtown, Pa, was descended on the
father's side from John Hunter, who served as lieutenant of cavalry
under William III. at the battle of the Boyne, his mother's lineage
being traced back to one Robert Owen, a Welsh quaker, who, refusing to
take the oath of allegiance after the restoration in 1685, was
imprisoned, and afterward emigrating to America, purchased an estate
near Philadelphia. On his father's death, Edward, who was then only 22
years of age, was offered his position as justice of the peace, but
refused it on account of his youth. A few years afterward he purchased a
farm in Chester co., Pa, where he was visited by three Mormon elders,
who were invited to make his house their home, though he had not yet
joined the faith. In 1839 he entertained as his guest the prophet
Joseph, who was then returning from his errand to Washington. In the
following year he was baptized by Orson Hyde, then on his way to
Jerusalem. In the summer of 1841 he proceeded to Nauvoo and purchased a
farm from the prophet, contributing the first year no less than $15,000
to the church. In 1847 he entered the valley of Great Salt Lake with the
first companies that followed the pioneers, and on the death of Newel K.
Whitney was appointed presiding bishop of the church.

    Of the early career of Franklin D. Richards mention has already been
made in these pages. In March 1869 he was appointed probate judge of
Weber co., and removed with his family to Ogden, his sons Franklin S.
and Charles being in 1885 prosecuting attorney, and county clerk and
recorder. With the advent of the railroad Ogden was clearly destined to
become a city second in importance only to the capital, and one that
must soon contain a large gentile element, whereby the commercial and
political control of northern Utah would be imperilled. At this
juncture, also, it became advisable that the Weber stake should be
raised to the dignity of an apostolic see, and for the purpose no better
selection could have been made than that of Franklin D. Richards.
Brought into contact with the business world during the many years when
he directed the immense European migration to Utah, a man without
political ambition, kindly, placable, and tolerant, his administration
was no less acceptable to the gentile than to the Mormon community. At
the close of 1855, though at that date in his 65th year, he still
discharged his manifold duties with all the vigor of a man yet in the
prime of life, and throughout his long career he has made not a single
enemy. As I have already stated, I am under deep obligations to Mr
Richards for his kindness in furnishing much valuable material for this
volume that would else have been inaccessible.

    Lorenzo Snow, a native of Mantua, Ohio, but of New England
parentage, first made the acquaintance of the Latter-day Saints while
visiting his sisters at Kirtland, Lorenzo having just completed his
course at Oberlin college. Convinced of the truth of their doctrines, he
was baptized, ordained an elder, and scut forth to preach. As a
missionary, none remained longer in the field, or travelled more, his
journeys between 1836 and 1872 extending over 150,000 miles. In Feb.
1846 he crossed the Mississippi in company with the twelve, being
himself ordained an apostle some three years later. When Box Elder co.
was organized, he was made president of the stake at Brigham City, and
afterward member of the council for Box Elder and Weber, both of which
positions he held for many years. He was an active promoter of the
coöperative movement, establishing in 1863-4 a coöperative store, and
afterward a tannery, a woollen factory, and several coöperative farms,
the employés having the privilege of counting the value of their labor
as so much capital <span id="page_775">p. 775</span> invested in the
concern. In the *Biography and Family Records of Lorenzo Snow, Written
and Compiled by his Sister, Eliza R. Snow Smith* (S. L. City, 1884), we
have an account of his travels and missionary labors, together with a
description of various incidents in the early career of the saints. The
book was written, however, as the authoress states, for the purpose of
being handed down in lineal descent from generation to generation, to be
preserved as a family memorial.

    Erastus Snow, who, with Orson Pratt, was, as the reader will
remember, the first of the pioneer band that entered the valley of Great
Salt Lake, joined the Mormon church in 1833, and two years afterward was
ordained an elder, though at this time only 17 years of age. Bidding
adieu to his parents at St Johnsbury, Vt—his birthplace—he journeyed to
Kirtland, and thenceforward became prominently identified with the
church, sharing in all its tribulations. In the winter of 1848-9 he was
chosen an apostle, filling, with Lorenzo Snow, F. D. Richards, and C. C.
Rich, the vacancies caused by the reorganization of the first
presidency, and the apostasy of Lyman Wight. Soon afterward he was sent
on a mission to Scandinavia, and through the branches of the church
which he established in that country it has been claimed that nearly
20,000 converts were gathered into the fold. After the close of his
missionary career his labors were directed to the founding and
development of various settlements in southern Utah, over which he
presided as their spiritual head, being also a member of council in the
territorial legislature.

    Like Heber C. Kimball, Charles Coulson Rich came of puritan stock,
though a native of Kentucky, where he was born in 1809 He was baptized
into the church in 1832, receiving his endowments at Kirtland, where he
was ordained a high-priest by Hyrum Smith. Moving to Far West in 1836,
he rendered good service during the persecutions in Missouri, being
afterward forced, to rice for his life through the wilderness, and
making his way to Nauvoo, where he was appointed a member of the high
council. In the winter of 1816-7 he was president of the stake at Mount
Pisgah, and set forth from Winter Quarters in June of the latter year in
charge of a company of saints. In 1849 he was chosen an apostle, and set
out on a mission to California, returning in Nov. 1850, and the
following year taking charge of the San Bernardino colony. His first
mission to Europe was in 1860, when he labored for two years in England,
again reaching Zion in 1863, when he settled in Bear Lake Valley, where
he resided for the most part until his decease in 1883, serving for
several terms as a member of the legislature. *Contributor.* Dec. 1883,
114-15.

    Albert Carrington, a native of Royalton, Vt, and a graduate of
Dartmouth college, joined the Mormon church in Wiota, Wis., in 1841, and
removed to Nauvoo in 1844, a few weeks before the prophet's
assassination. A member of the pioneer band, he returned with Brigham
Young to gather up the main body of the saints, and journeyed with them
to the valley in 1848. After the admission of Utah as a territory, he
was several times elected a member of the council until 1868, when he
was sent to England to preside over the European missions. For twenty
years, when not on some mission, he acted as private secretary to
Brigham, and his ability gained for him among anti-Mormons the sobriquet
of 'The Mormon Wolsey.' In 1870 he was ordained an apostle, and for
several years afterward presided over the British mission.

    Elias Smith, nephew to Joseph Smith, the prophet's father, was born
at Royalton, Vt, near the birthplace of the former. Joining the Mormon
faith in 1834, being then 30 years of age, he removed in 1836 to
Kirtland, and thence to Nauvoo, where he was business manager of the
*Times and Seasons* and *Nauvoo Neighbor,* filling the same position on
the staff of the *Deseret News* after his arrival in Salt Lake City. In
185l he was appointed probate judge of Salt Lake county, which office he
retained for many years; and throughout his public career it may be said
that he was almost without an enemy; in such respect were his decisions
held, both in law and in equity, while his private life was also beyond
reproach.

    In connection with the judiciary of Utah may be mentioned Alexander
<span id="page_776">p. 776</span> Pyper, a native of Ayrshire, Scotland,
who in 1874 was appointed police court judge of Salt Lake City. His
administration of justice was somewhat in contrast with that which
prevailed in the third judicial district, James B. McKean being in
office during the same year. At that date the questions asked by the
prosecuting attorney of jurors and applicants for citizenship were of
such a nature that they frequently excluded persons who were not
polygamists but simply believed in the Mormon faith, among them being,
'Are you a Mormon?' 'Have you been through the Mormon Endowment House?'
'Do you believe that polygamy is a divine revelation?' 'My education and
religion,' remarked Judge Pyper, 'have taught me to deal fairly and
justly toward all men, under the law, irrespective of their conditions
or opinions.'

    David O. Calder, a native of Thurso, Caithness, Scotland, joined the
Mormon church in 1840, and in 1851 started for Utah, accompanied by his
mother and her family. A man of excellent business ability, his talents
were quickly recognized. In 1857 he was appointed chief clerk to the
trustee in trust of the church, and in that position organized a system
of accounts and records in all the departments of the church. Between
1859 and 1870 he held office as territorial treasurer, and after a visit
to his native country, where he also labored as a missionary, was chosen
business manager and managing editor of the *Deseret News,* and a
director of Zion's Coöperative Mercantile Institute, which latter
position he held until his decease in July 1884.

    Among the presidents of the Utah stake of Zion may be mentioned
Harvey Harris Cluff, a native of Kirtland, whose ancestors settled at
Durham, N. H., a few years after the arrival of the *Mayflower,* and
whose father, David Cluff, served in the American army during the war of
1812. Removing from Durham to Ohio in 1830, David and his family joined
the Mormon faith, and proceeding thence to Nauvoo, shared in all the
hardships of the exodus, arriving in the autumn of 1850 in the valley of
Great Salt Lake, where they cast in their lot at Provo. On the 6th of
October, 1856, when Brigham Young announced before a general conference
of the church the threatened disaster to the hand-cart emigrants, Harvey
Cluff, then only in his twentieth year, was one of the first who
volunteered to go to their aid. On this occasion he states that the
provisions and clothing furnished before nightfall were more than
sufficent to lead 22 teams. In 1859 Mr Cluff was elected city
councillor, and in 1875, after his missionary labors, principally in
Europe and the Sandwich Islands, was ordained bishop, and assigned two
years later to the charge of the fourth ward of Provo City. *Biog.*
