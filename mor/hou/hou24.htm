<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the disputes between Governor Cumming and General Johnston, the latter being aided, as we have seen, by the federal judges, there was constant fear that the troops would come into collision with the territorial militia. Though the Mormon authorities had no cause for complaint as to the conduct of the soldiery, they regarded their presence as a menace, and condemned the proceedings of the general and the judges as a personal insult to the governor.</p>  
<p>After the arrival of the army, Brigham never appeared in public without a body-guard of his own intimate friends;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_876"></A><A HREF="#fn_876"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and for many months he attended no public assemblies. At the door of his residence sentries kept watch by day, and at night a strong guard was stationed within its walls. Nor were these precautions unnecessary. About the end of March 1859 a writ was issued for his apprehension on a groundless charge of complicity in forging notes on</p>

<p><a name="page_573"><font size="1" color="green">p. 573</font></A></p>  
<p>the United States treasury.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_877"></A><A HREF="#fn_877"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The officers deputed to make the arrest repaired to the governor's quarters and besought his co&ouml;peration, but were promptly refused, Cumming protesting against the measure as an unjustifiable outrage,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_878"></A><A HREF="#fn_878"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> whereupon they returned in discomfiture to Camp Floyd.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the trouble was not yet ended. In May, Judge Sinclair was to open his court at Salt Lake City, and threatened to station there a detachment of troops. On Sunday the 17th of April it was reported that two regiments were on their way to the city for the purpose of making arrests, whereat General Wells at once ordered out the militia, and within a few hours five thousand men were under arms.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_879"></A><A HREF="#fn_879"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> It was now expected</p>

<p>and almost hoped that the Nauvoo legion would measure its strength with the army of Utah, but by a little timely forbearance on both sides the threatened encounter was averted. Soon afterward the judges were instructed as to their duty in an official letter from the attorney-general, and were ordered to confine themselves within their official sphere, which was to try causes, and not to intermeddle with the movements of the troops&#8212;the latter responsibility resting only with the governor. "In a territory like Utah," he remarked, "the person who exercises this power can make war and peace when he pleases, and holds in his hands the issues of life and death for thousands. Surely it was not intended to clothe each one of the judges, as well as the marshal and all his deputies, with this tremendous authority. Especially does this construction seem erroneous when we reflect that these different officers might make requisitions conflicting with one another, and all of them crossing the path of the governor."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_880"></A><A HREF="#fn_880"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> The judges were superseded a few months later;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_881"></A><A HREF="#fn_881"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and thus the matter was finally set at rest, the action of the governor being sustained, although he became so unpopular with the cabinet that for a time his removal was also under consideration.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_882"></A><A HREF="#fn_882"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> Though his resignation was not demanded,</p>

<p>he set forth from Salt Lake City in May 1861, about two months before his term of office expired. He had entered that city amid a forced display of welcome, but he left it with the sincere regrets of a people whose hearts he had won by kind treatment.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_883"></A><A HREF="#fn_883"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1860 most of the troops were removed to Mexico and Arizona, and about a year later, war between north and south being then almost a certainty, the remainder of the army was ordered to the eastern states. The government stores at Camp Floyd, valued at $4,000,000, were sold at extremely low prices, greatly to the relief of the saints, who could now purchase provisions, clothing, wagons, live-stock, and other articles of which they were in need, at their own rates. Flour, which had cost the nation $570 per ton, sold for less than $11 per ton, and other stores in the same proportion; the entire proceeds of the sale did not exceed $100,000, or little more than two per cent of the outlay; and of this sum $40,000 was contributed by Brigham.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_884"></A><A HREF="#fn_884"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>

<p>merchants of Salt Lake City laid the basis of their fortunes; to the rest of the community its main benefit was that it gave them a good supply of warm clothing at cheap rates. For years afterward the members of the Nauvoo legion were attired in military uniforms, which now took the place of the sombre gray clothing that the saints were accustomed to wear. The ammunition and spare arms were destroyed, some of the cannon being exploded and others thrown into wells, though the latter were recovered by the Mormons, and are still used on the 4th and 24th of July, and other of their festivities.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_885"></A><A HREF="#fn_885"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have now arrived at a period in the history of Utah when it may be of interest to give a brief description of the industrial and social condition of the Mormons. Between the years 1850 and 1862 they had increased in number from 11,380 to about 65,000, a gain that has seldom been equalled in any of the states or territories of the republic.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_886"></A><A HREF="#fn_886"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> They were a very healthy community, the number of deaths recorded in the census report for the year ending June 1860 being little more than nine per thousand,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_887"></A><A HREF="#fn_887"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> though this is doubtless a mistake, the actual death rate being probably at least twelve per thousand.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_888"></A><A HREF="#fn_888"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> Of the mortality,</p>

<p>about twenty-six per cent occurred among infants,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_889"></A><A HREF="#fn_889"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> the most prominent diseases among adults being consumption and enteriris. It is worthy of note that up to this date there occurred in the territory but one case of suicide among the Mormons.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_890"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> There was little pauperism in their midst, and there was little crime, or such crime as was punished by imprisonment.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_891"></A><A HREF="#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saints were now a fairly prosperous community. The value of their real and personal property was reported in 1860 at $5,596,118, of improved farm lands at $1,333,355, of farming implements $242,889, of live-stock $1,516,707, and of manufactures $900,153. To these figures about 50 per cent must be added in order to obtain the actual value. Among the list of premiums bestowed in this year by the Deseret Agricultural and Manufacturing Society,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_892"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> we find prizes and diplomas awarded for agricultural and gardening implements of all kinds, for steam-engines and fire-engines, for leathern manufactures of every description from heavy harness to ladies' kid boots of many</p>

<p>buttons, for woollen and cotton goods, including carpets, blankets, flannels, jeans, linseys, kerseys, and cassimeres, for many articles of furniture, and for the most needed articles of cutlery and hardware.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prices of most necessaries of life were moderate throughout the territory, but on account of high freights&#8212;averaging from the eastern states about $28 and from the Pacific seaboard $50 to $60 per ton&#8212;imported commodities were inordinately dear.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A> The cost of luxuries mattered but little, however, to a community that subsisted mainly on the fruits and vegetables of their own gardens, and the bread, milk, and butter produced on their own farms.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wages were somewhat high at this period, common laborers receiving $2 per day and domestic servants $30 to $40 per month. Lumbermen, wood-choppers, brick-makers, masons, carpenters, plasterers, and painters were in demand at good rates; though until 1857, and perhaps for a year or two later, their hire was usually paid in kind, as there was still but little money in circulation. Thus, a mechanic might be required to receive his wages in hats, boots, or clothing, whether he needed such articles or not, and must probably submit to a heavy discount in disposing of his wares for cash or for such goods as he might require. Some commodities, however, among which were flour, sugar, coffee, and butter, could usually be sold at their par value, and some could not even be bought for cash in large quantities. Most of the stores divided their stock into two classes of wares, which they termed cash-goods and shelf-goods, and the tradesman objected to sell any considerable amount of the former unless he disposed, at the same time, of a portion of</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_579"><font size="1" color="green">p. 579</font></A></p>  
<p>the latter. If, for instance, one should tender $50 for a bag of sugar without offering to make other purchases, the store-keeper would probably refuse; "for," he would argue, "if I sell all my cash-goods for cash, without also getting rid of my shelf-goods, I shall not be able to dispose of the latter for cash at all. I must dole out the one with care that I may be able to get rid of the other."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some of the shop windows on Main Street were displayed costly imported commodities&#8212;silks, velvets, and shawls of diverse pattern, jewelry, laces, and millinery;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A> near by were less pretentious stores, where home-made and second-hand articles were retailed. In some of the latter might be seen a curious collection of dilapidated merchandise, and people almost as singular as the wares over which they chaffered. Here was a group of women holding solemn conclave over a superannuated gown that to other eyes would seem worthless; there a sister in faded garb cheapening a well-battered bonnet of Parisian make that had already served as covering and ornament for half a dozen heads.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approaching Zion from the direction of Fort Bridger, after days of travel through sage-brush and buffalo-grass, the traveller would observe that within a score of leagues from Salt Lake City nature's barrenness began to succumb to the marvellous energy of the saints. The ca&ntilde;ons had been converted by irrigation into fertile lands, whose emerald tint soothed the eye wearied with the leaden monotony of the desert landscape.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The fields were billowing with grain, the cattle sleek and thriving, the barns well filled, the windmills buzzing merrily. Nevertheless, among these smiling settlements a painful deficiency might be noticed. Everything that industry and thrift could accomplish had been done for the farm, but nothing for the home. Between the houses of the poor and the rich there was little difference, except that one was of logs and the other of boards. Both seemed like mere enclosures in which to eat and sleep, and</p>

<p>around neither was there any sign that the inmates took a pride in their home. One might pass three dwellings enclosed by a common fence, and belonging to one master, but nowhere could be seen any of those simple embellishments that cost so little and mean so much&#8212;the cultivated garden plat, the row of shade trees, the rose-bush at the doorway, or the trellised creeper at the porch.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city itself wore a different aspect. The streets,</p>  
<p><a name="page_581"><font size="1" color="green">p. 581</font></A></p>  
<p>though unpaved and without sidewalks, were lined with cotton-wood and locust trees, acacias, and poplars. Most of the private houses were still of wood or adobe, some few only being of stone, and none pretentious as to architecture; but nearly all were surrounded with gardens in which fruit and shade trees were plentiful. Many of them were of the same pattern, barn-shaped, with wings and tiny casements, for glass was not yet manufactured by the Mormons. A few of the better class were built on a foundation of sandstone, and somewhat in the shape of a bungalow, with trellised verandas, and low flat roofs supported by pillars. Those of the poor were small hut-like buildings, most of them one-storied, and some with several entrances. At this date the entire city, except on its southern side, was enclosed by a wall some ten or twelve feet high, with semi-bastions placed at half musket-range, and pierced here and there with gateways.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In driving through the suburbs the visitor would find the thoroughfares in bad condition, dusty in summer, and in winter filled with viscid mud. On either side were posts and rails, which, as the heart of the city was approached, gave way to neat fences of palings. On Main Street were the abodes of some of the leading Mormon dignitaries and the stores of prominent gentile merchants. On the eastern side, nearly opposite the post-office, and next door to a small structure that served for bath-house and bakery, stood the principal hostelry, the Salt Lake House, a large pent-roofed building, in front of which was a veranda supported by painted posts, and a sign-board swinging from a tall flag-staff. Here fair accommodation</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_582"><font size="1" color="green">p. 582</font></A></p>  
<p>could be had at very moderate charges.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> Even in its business portion, Main Street had at this date many vacant lots, being then in the embryo condition through which all cities must pass, the log building standing side by side with the adobe hut and the stone or brick store, with here and there a few shanties, relics of the days of 1848.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the principal attractions was the temple block, surrounded in 1860 with a wall of red sandstone, on which were placed layers of adobe, fashioned in imitation of some richer substance, and raising it to a height of ten feet. On each face of the wall were thirty pilasters, also of adobe, protected by sandstone copings, but without pedestals or entablatures. Up to the year 1860 the cost of the wall and the foundations of the edifice already amounted to $1,000,000, a sum equal to the entire outlay on the temple at Nauvoo. The block was consecrated on the 3d of February, 1853, and the corner-stones laid with imposing ceremonies on the 6th of the following April.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_899"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A> In August 1860, the foundations, which were sixteen feet deep and of gray granite, had been completed, but no further progress had been made. I shall reserve until later a description of the building as it now stands. Of the tabernacle which occupied the southwest corner of the block, and the bowery immediately north of the tabernacle, mention has already been made.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A> In the north-west corner, and separated from</p>

<p>the tabernacle by a high fence, stood the endowment house,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A> where, as evil-minded gentiles declared, human sacrifices were offered. The ceremonies that actually took place within its walls have been described elsewhere in this volume.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blocks adjacent to the tabernacle were the residences of Brigham, Heber, Orson Hyde, George A. Smith, Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, and Daniel H. Wells, the first two occupying entire blocks.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_902"></A><A HREF="#fn_902"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A> South of temple block was the council-house,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_903"></A><A HREF="#fn_903"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A> south of Brigham's dwelling and adjoining that of Wells was the historian's office, where the church records were kept, and in the next plat to the east was the social hall,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_904"></A><A HREF="#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A> where the fashion of the city held festivities.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balls held at the social hall were extremely select, and sometimes a little expensive, tickets for the more pretentious f&ecirc;tes costing ten dollars for each couple, and the invitations, which were difficult to obtain even at that price,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_905"></A><A HREF="#fn_905"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A> being issued on embossed and bordered</p>

<p>paper. Dancing commenced about four P.M., the president of the church pronouncing a blessing with uplifted hands, and then leading off the first cotillon. All joined vigorously in the dance, and the prophet, his apostles, and bishops set the example, the saltations not being in the languid gliding pace then fashionable in other cities, but elaborately executed steps requiring severe muscular exercise. At eight came supper, a substantial repast, with four courses,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_906"></A><A HREF="#fn_906"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A> after which dancing was resumed, varied at intervals with song until four or five o'clock in the morning, when the party broke up, the entertainment closing with prayer and benediction.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides these fashionable gatherings held from time to time by the &eacute;lite of Zion, there were ward parties, elders' cotillon parties, and picnic parties, the last being sometimes held at the social hall, where rich and poor assembled, bringing with them their children, and setting their own tables, or ordering dainties from an adjoining kitchen provided for that purpose. Here, also, until 1862, when the first theatre was built, theatrical entertainments were given in winter,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_907"></A><A HREF="#fn_907"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A> and these of no mean order, for among the Mormons there was no lack of amateur talent.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_908"></A><A HREF="#fn_908"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A> Among those who participated</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the amusements of the people were thus cared for, there was no lack of more solid entertainment. All had access to the public library under proper restrictions, and in the council-house was opened, in 1853, the first reading-room, which was supplied with newspapers and magazines from all parts of the world. Among the scientific associations may be mentioned the Universal Scientific Society, established in 1854, with Wilford Woodruff as president, and the Polysophical Society, over which Lorenzo Snow presided.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_911"></A><A HREF="#fn_911"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A> The musical talent of Salt Lake City formed themselves, in 1855, into the Deseret Philharmonic Society, and in June of that year a music hall was in course of construction.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_912"></A><A HREF="#fn_912"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A> In the same</p>

<p>year the Deseret Theological Institute was organized, its purpose being to make known the principles of light and truth which its members claimed to have received from the priesthood, in the belief that "the science of theology embraces a knowledge of all intelligence, whether in heaven or on the earth, moral, scientific, literary, or religious"!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prominent among the charitable associations was the Relief Society, originally organized by Joseph Smith at Nauvoo in 1842, and discontinued after his assassination until 1855, when it was re&euml;stablished in Salt Lake City. After that date its operations gradually extended from ward to ward and from settlement to settlement, until it became a powerful influence for good throughout the land. Its main purpose was the relief of the poor, and by its efforts it prevented the necessity for poor-houses, which are still unknown among the latter-day saints, and otherwise it rendered good service&#8212;by educating orphans, by promoting home industries, and by giving tone and character to society through its moral and social influence.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_913"></A><A HREF="#fn_913"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the student of humanity there were few richer fields for study than could be found at this period in the Mormon capital, where almost every state in the union and every nation in Europe had its representatives. There were to be seen side by side the tall, sinewy Norwegian, fresh from his pine forests, the phlegmatic Dane, the stolid, practical German, the dapper, quick-minded Frenchman, the clumsy, dogmatic Englishman, and the shrewd, versatile American. So little did the emigrants know of the land in which their lot was cast that some of them, while crossing the plains, were not aware that they trod on American soil, and others cast away their blankets and warm clothing, under the impression that perpetual summer reigned in Zion. A few years&#8217; residence</p>

<p>in the land of the saints accomplishes a wonderful change, the contrast in mien and physique between the recruits and the older settlers being very strongly marked. Especially is this the case among the women. "I could not but observe in those born hereabouts," writes an English traveller in 1860, "the noble, regular features, the lofty, thoughtful brow, the clear, transparent complexion, the long, silky hair, and, greatest charm of all, the soft smile of the American woman when she does smile."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_914"></A><A HREF="#fn_914"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A></p>

<p>from polygamous unions. It has never been shown that physical development suffers from the polygamous system, especially when regulated by religion, as in the case of the Mormons. The children of saints are much like other children. In the streets of the capital, however, during the period under review, might be seen youths of eighteen or twenty, some of them the children of church dignitaries, whose highest ambition was satisfied when they could ride through the streets, hallooing and shouting, fantastically attired in fringed and embroidered buckskin leggings, gaudily colored shirt, and slouched hat, and with the orthodox revolver and bowie-knife conspicuously displayed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_915"></A><A HREF="#fn_915"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A> They resembled somewhat the cow-boy of the present day; but their presence was barely felt amid this staid and order-loving community,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_916"></A><A HREF="#fn_916"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A> the forwardness of the second generation of the saints being attributed, not without show of reason, to the corrupting influence of the gentiles.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to estimate fairly the character of the population of Salt Lake City, which numbered in 1860 about 14,000,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_917"></A><A HREF="#fn_917"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A> the visitor should attend the bowery or tabernacle, where according to the season of the year about 3,000 of the populace assembled on Sunday. The men appeared, in warm weather, without coats and with open vests, but always in decent and cleanly garb, most of them being clad in gray tweed, though some of the elders and dignitaries wore black broadcloth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_918"></A><A HREF="#fn_918"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A> The women wore silks, woollen stuffs,</p>

The oratory was somewhat of the Boanerges stamp, and contained much round abuse of the gentiles; but looking at the audience, which consisted, in the main, of a thriving, contented, and industrious class of people, light-hearted and ever ready to laugh at the somewhat broad jokes of the church dignitaries, it was impossible to believe all the hard things spoken and written of them by their enemies. Moreover, about one third of the population consisted at this date of emigrants from Great Britain, and at least two fifths were foreigners of other nationalities, most of them Danes, Swedes, or Norwegians. They were fair types of their race, and it is not very probable</p>

<p><a name="page_590"><font size="1" color="green">p. 590</font></A></p>  
<p>that they had so quickly changed their national characteristics as already to forfeit the good opinion of their fellow-men.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such was Zion in 1860, and such its population. Of the progress and condition of other settlements established soon after the Mormon occupation, and the founding of which has already been mentioned, I shall have occasion to speak later. During the thirteen years that had now elapsed since first they entered the valley, the saints had pushed forward their colonies in all directions almost to the verge of their territory. Especially was this the case toward the west, where, at an early date, they came into antagonism with settlers from California. In 1850 a few persons from that state had settled in Carson valley for trading purposes, the migration of gold-seekers, some of whom wintered in that region, being then very considerable. During the following year several Mormons entered the valley, John Reese, who arrived there in the spring with thirteen wagon-loads of provisions, building the first house, known for several years as the Mormon station, on the site of the present village of Genoa.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_920"></A><A HREF="#fn_920"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A> Reese first came to the valley alone, his nearest neighbor, James Fennimore, living in Gold Ca&ntilde;on, some twenty-five miles distant, in a "dug-out," or hole scooped out of the bank, the front part covered in this instance with rags and strips of canvas, the man being thriftless and a dram-drinker. He was nicknamed Virginia, and after him was named the city whence more bullion has been shipped in a single year than would now replace the floating capital of the states of California and Nevada.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_921"></A><A HREF="#fn_921"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A></p>

<p><a name="page_591"><font size="1" color="green">p. 591</font></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By an act of the Utah legislature, approved January 17, 1854, the limits of Carson county were defined,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_922"></A><A HREF="#fn_922"><FONT SIZE="1">47</FONT></A> and the governor was authorized to appoint for it a probate judge whose duty it should be to organize the county, by dividing it into precincts, holding an election, filling the various offices, and locating the county seat. The choice fell on Orson Hyde, who with Judge Styles, the United States marshal, and an escort of thirty-five men, reached the settlement of John Reese in June 1855, other parties of Mormons arriving during this and the following year. Meanwhile miners, farmers, and herdsmen from California and the Atlantic states had settled in the valley and elsewhere on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada in such numbers as to alarm the Mormons, who now desired them to leave the territory. This they refused to do, and some pretended fears of a resort to force. The gentiles fortified themselves, and assumed an aggressive attitude, and for two weeks the opposing forces were en-camped almost within sight of each other, but without coming to blows. News of the disturbance reached the mining camps on the other side of the mountains, and numbers prepared to go in aid of their comrades. The aggressors now feared that they would be themselves expelled from the country, and proposed a truce, under which all should be allowed to remain on their lands.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the matter became known to the authorities, the county organization was repealed, the probate judge recalled, and the records, which contained several criminal indictments of a serious</p>

<p>nature,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_923"></A><A HREF="#fn_923"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A> were removed to Salt Lake City. When news arrived of the approach of the army of Utah, the Carson Mormons were ordered, as we have seen, to return to Zion and aid in its defence, though a few remained in the valley. In 1859 the gentile inhabitants, after several fruitless appeals to congress, formally declared their independence,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_924"></A><A HREF="#fn_924"><FONT SIZE="1">49</FONT></A> and demanded admission as a territory. Two years later the request was granted, and the territory of Nevada was cut off from Utah, its eastern limit being fixed at the thirty-ninth meridian, but extended by act of 1862 to the thirty-eighth, and by act of 1866 to the thirty-seventh meridian. Reluctantly the Mormons relinquished these portions of the public domain.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Eagle and Washoe valleys they had also established small settlements in 1854 and 1855, remaining until recalled in 1857, at which latter date, as will be remembered, the colony at San Bernardino in California was also abandoned. During the Mormon occupation the county of San Bernardino was cut off from that of Los Angeles, the former assuming its proportion of the liabilities. A city was built, with substantial dwellings, saw and grist mills, and surrounded</p>

<p>with thriving farms;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_925"></A><A HREF="#fn_925"><FONT SIZE="1">50</FONT></A> a road was constructed as far as the timber belt in the neighboring mountains, each man working incessantly until it was completed, and all this was accomplished without incurring debt, a small balance remaining in the county treasury when the settlers were ordered by Brigham to Salt Lake City.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_926"></A><A HREF="#fn_926"><FONT SIZE="1">51</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Elder Samuel Brannan's party which arrived in San Francisco, as will be remembered, in the summer of 1846, mention is made in connection with my <i>History of California</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_927"></A><A HREF="#fn_927"><FONT SIZE="1">52</FONT></A> During this year, a settlement named New Hope was founded by a portion of the company on the north bank of the Stanislaus River, near its junction with the San Joaquin, but was abandoned when news was received that the brethren had resolved to remain in the valley of Great Salt Lake. Most of the Mormons still remained, however, in California, betaking themselves to farming and lumbering until the time of the gold discovery, when they gathered at the mines on Mormon Island. Between 1848 and 1850 about a hundred and forty of them found their way to Utah; the remainder cast in their lot with the gentiles, and most of them, among whom was their leader, apostatized, though a few afterward joined the Mormon communities at San Bernardino and in Arizona.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_928"></A><A HREF="#fn_928"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the territory of Utah many new colonies were established. In 1853 the first settlement was made in Summit county by one Samuel Snider, who built a number of sawmills in Parley Park. In 1861 the county was organized, and soon became noted for</p>

<p>brought it into prominence, and to aid in their development a short line of railroad was built,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_929"></A><A HREF="#fn_929"><FONT SIZE="1">54</FONT></A> but afterward dismantled and abandoned. Coalville, the present county seat, was first settled in 1859.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_930"></A><A HREF="#fn_930"><FONT SIZE="1">55</FONT></A> In 1858 the site of the present town of Kamas was occupied as a grazing ground by Thomas Rhoads, and was then known as Rhoads Valley. Two years later a few families settled there, and in 1862 a ward was organized, with William G. Russell as presiding elder.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_931"></A><A HREF="#fn_931"><FONT SIZE="1">56</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About seven miles north-west of Kamas, and on the east bank of the Weber, the village of Peoa was founded in 1860 by a party of ten settlers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_932"></A><A HREF="#fn_932"><FONT SIZE="1">57</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1853 Fort Bridger, with its Mexican grant of thirty square miles of land, on which stood a few cabins, was sold for $8,000 to the Mormons,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_933"></A><A HREF="#fn_933"><FONT SIZE="1">58</FONT></A> who during the following year expended an equal sum in improvements. This was the first property owned by the saints in Green River county. At Fort Supply, in this neighborhood, a settlement was formed about the same time by John Nebeker, Isaac Bullock, and about fifty others from Salt Lake and Utah counties. In 1862 the first settlement was made in Wasatch county, south of Green River and Summit counties, on the site of the present village of Wallsburg.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_934"></A><A HREF="#fn_934"><FONT SIZE="1">59</FONT></A> Situated for the most part at an elevation of about seven thousand feet, with a heavy snow-fall and prolific of streams, this section of the territory was and is yet mainly used for stock-ranges, though in the</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morgan county, west of Summit, was named after Jedediah Morgan Grant, who with Thomas J. Thurston and others first occupied it in the spring of 1855. In 1862 it was organized, the county seat, Morgan City, being incorporated six years later. The village of Milton was settled by Thurston in 1856, and Enterprise, which together with Morgan is now on the line of the Union Pacific, in 1862.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1856 a party of six brethren settled in Cache Valley on the site of the present town of Wellsville, Cache county, north of Weber, being organized during the following year. Except toward the north, the valley is surrounded by mountains, on which the snow lingers late into autumn, thus affording water for irrigation throughout the year. Though the first attempt at agriculture resulted in failure on account of the severity of the climate, excellent crops were afterward raised, and soon this section became known as the granary of Utah. Amid the ranges are vast belts of timber, so dense that there are places where the sunlight never penetrates, and where the foot of man has never trod. Minerals are also abundant, though little utilized at present. During the year 1856 a fort was built at Wellsville, the site of the town being laid out in 1862, when a hundred and fifty families were gathered there.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_935"></A><A HREF="#fn_935"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A> Logan City, about six miles north of Wellsville, and the capital of Cache county, was located by Peter Maughan in the spring of 1859, the spot being selected on account of its rich soil and pasture, and the ample water power afforded by the Logan River. The first settlers drew lots for their</p>

<p><a name="page_597"><font size="1" color="green">p. 597</font></A></p>  
<p>land,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_936"></A><A HREF="#fn_936"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A> and in 1860 the site was surveyed, the city being divided into four wards in 1861, and incorporated five years later. About five miles to the west of Wellsville the settlement of Mendon was commenced in 1857,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_937"></A><A HREF="#fn_937"><FONT SIZE="1">62</FONT></A> the settlers removing to Wellsville in the winter of 1858-59 for protection against Indians, and returning the following year in greater number. The first buildings were of logs, with roofs and floors of mud, timber being scarce in that neighborhood.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_938"></A><A HREF="#fn_938"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1859 Seth and Robert Langton, Robert and John Thornley, travelled northward from Salt Lake City in search of an agricultural site. Arriving at Summit creek, they settled within half a mile of the present town of Smithfield, Cache county. In November the settlement was organized as a ward, with John G. Smith as bishop, and in March 1860 a survey was begun. A few weeks later troubles arose with the Indians,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_939"></A><A HREF="#fn_939"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A> compelling the settlers to build and take refuge in a fort, in which they remained until late in the following year. At the close of 1861 there were in operation a lumber-mill, a molasses-mill, and a tannery,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_940"></A><A HREF="#fn_940"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A> and the town had then been laid out in its present form. Other settlements in Cache county were Hyde Park, five miles north of Logan, and now on the line of the Utah and northern railroad, where, in 1860, sixteen families were gathered;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_941"></A><A HREF="#fn_941"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A> Providence, two miles south of Logan,</p>

<p>where the first settlers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_942"></A><A HREF="#fn_942"><FONT SIZE="1">67</FONT></A> took up their abode in April 1859; Millville, two miles farther south, located in June 1860;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_943"></A><A HREF="#fn_943"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A> Paradise, at the southern extremity of the valley, containing in 1861 about thirty inhabitants,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_944"></A><A HREF="#fn_944"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A> and Hyrum, settled in 1860 by about twenty families.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_945"></A><A HREF="#fn_945"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far the progress of Mormon colonization in the north, east, and west. Toward the south, the first settlement in Beaver county, between Millard and Iron counties, dates from 1856, at which time Simeon F. Howd, James P. Anderson, and Wilson G. Mowers arrived in Beaver Valley, commenced to build a log cabin, and made preparations for farming and stock-raising. Soon afterward they were joined by others, making in all some thirty or forty families, and in the spring of 1858 the site of Beaver City was laid out.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_946"></A><A HREF="#fn_946"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A> The appearance of the valley was not inviting. Situated at an altitude of 6,500 feet, frosty and barren, its surface covered in parts with sage-brush and its soil everywhere impregnated with alkali, it was at first considered unfit for occupation. Its main attraction was the volume of water afforded by Beaver River, which courses through the valley from east to west, its source being at an altitude</p>

<p>of nearly twelve thousand feet. Within recent years, as we shall presently see, this district has proved itself rich in minerals. Next in importance to Beaver City, and about twenty miles to the southwest, was Minersville, first settled in 1859, with J. H. Rollins as bishop of the ward.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal settlement in Kane county, which lay south of Iron and east of Washington county, and at one time included a portion of the latter, was Virgin City, founded in 1858, on the upper Virgin River.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_947"></A><A HREF="#fn_947"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A> Its site is in a valley about seven miles in width, and enclosed by mountains, their foothills, seamed and broken by the rains, leaving but a narrow margin for cultivation on the banks of the stream, covered with a dense growth of cotton-woods and an undergrowth of sage and rabbit brush. Five or six miles west of Virgin City was the town of Toquerville, established in 1858 by several families front Cedar City.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_948"></A><A HREF="#fn_948"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1854 Jacob Hamblin and two others were sent as missionaries to the Lamanites in the valley of the Virgin and Santa Clara rivers in Washington county, with orders to establish a settlement in that neighborhood. They found the Indians peaceably disposed, and in a measure civilized, many of them being engaged in planting corn, wheat, and squashes, but depending mainly for bread on the seeds of wild grasses.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_949"></A><A HREF="#fn_949"><FONT SIZE="1">74</FONT></A></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 1861 three hundred of the saints, under the direction of Orson Pratt and Erastus Snow, were ordered to proceed to this district, and build a city, to be named St George, near the junction of the Virgin and Santa Clara rivers in Washington county. In January 1862 a site was selected and surveyed, the city incorporated,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_950"></A><A HREF="#fn_950"><FONT SIZE="1">75</FONT></A> though yet unbuilt, and the people took possession of their lots. Before doing so it was decided by unanimous vote that the first building erected should be a social hall, to be used for educational and other purposes.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_951"></A><A HREF="#fn_951"><FONT SIZE="1">76</FONT></A> In September Brigham visited the settlers, and advised them to build, as soon as possible, a substantial, commodious, and well-finished meeting-house, or tabernacle, large enough to seat at least two thousand persons, and one that would be an ornament to their city and a credit to their enterprise. The foundation stones were laid on the 1st of June, 1873, the prophet's birthday, and the building completed eight years later, at a cost of $110,000. Before its settlement, the valley of St George presented a barren appearance, its surface being strongly impregnated with mineral salts, even the bottom-lands of the Virgin and Santa Clara showing large strips of alkaline soil. Its climate was mild, and, with irrigation, crops of many kinds could be raised; but water was scarce, an artesian well sunk in 1862, at a cost of $5,000, being abandoned as a failure, after attaining a depth of more than two hundred feet.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_952"></A><A HREF="#fn_952"><FONT SIZE="1">77</FONT></A> Notwithstanding these drawbacks, the city became</p>

<p>those that afterward attained prominence. They differed but little in outward appearance from the pioneer settlements in other parts of the United States, except in one particular. Throughout the entire territory, there was rarely to be seen, except in Salt Lake City, a store or a mechanic's sign, traffic being carried on from house to house, and the few extraneous wants of the settlers being mainly supplied by peddlers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_956"></A><A HREF="#fn_956"><FONT SIZE="1">81</FONT></A></p>

Though there was no indication that trade in its ordinary sense existed among these communities, and one might search in vain for a hotel, or even for a bath-house or a barber's shop, most of the ordinary crafts were represented, and all that was needful could be obtained for money.</p>

It is very improbable that Cumming would have taken such an extreme measure, and I find no mention of it in his official despatches, in those of General Johnston, or in the files of the <i>Deseret News</i>. Gen. Wells himself gives the following <a name="page_574"><font size="1" color="green">p. 574</font></A> account of the matter: 'I told Cumming myself that we didn't intend the Carthage scene reinacted, and he knew that we intended to resist the troops, which we did. I went to see Cumming frequently, and talked the matter over with him, and he declared himself that he could not recommend Gov. Young to trust himself to that military mob; but he did say he could not see how bloodshed could be hindered. I told him we would not let them come; that if they did come, they would never get out alive if we could help it. He said he did not know what to do.' 'They knew that if they did come, we were ready for them, and that we were ready to cut off their retreat. It gave us a good deal of trouble, and anxiety as well, to prepare against it, as it occurred at a time when we were putting in our crops.' <i>Narr</i>., MS., 634.</P>

In amusing contrast with Burton's remarks are those of Surgeon Bartholow, who in his sanitary report says: 'It is a curious fact that Mormonism makes its impress upon the countenance,&#8230;an expression compounded of sensuality, cunning, suspicion, and a smirking self-conceit. The yellow, sunken, cadaverous visage; the greenish colored eyes; the thick, protuberant lips; the low forehead; the light yellowish hair; and the lank, angular person&#8212;constitute an appearance so characteristic of the new race, the production of polygamy, as to distinguish them at a glance. The women of this territory, how fanatical and ignorant soever, recognize their wide departure from the normal standard in all christian countries, and from the degradation of the mother follows that of the child.' <i>Sen.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The City of the Saints, and across the Rocky Mountains to California</i>, by Richard F. Burton, London, 1861, ranks among the best of gentile works on Mormonism. Less philosophical than that of Gunnison, it is equally impartial, and gives many details as to the social and industrial condition of the Mormons for which one may search in vain elsewhere. His stay in S. L. City lasted less than four weeks (from Aug. 25 to Sept. 20, 1860), excursions being made during his visit to points of interest in the neighborhood, but he saw more during that time than many others have done in four years. Travelling in company with Lieut Dana of the U.S. artillery, and procuring introductions to Gov. Cumming, Brigham Young, and several of the church dignitaries, he had every opportunity to note the different phases of Mormon life. The first and last portions of the work are taken up with his travels from St Joseph, Mo., to San Francisco, the middle chapters only relating to Utah. In style and tone the writer is sketchy and interesting, good-natured, but somewhat disposed to regard matters in their ludicrous aspect, for which he offers in his preface the excuse&#8212;<i>sic me natura fecit</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A Visit to Salt Lake; being a Journey across the Plains and a Residence in the Mormon Settlements at Utah, by William ChandIess</i>, London, 1857, is the title of a less entertaining and reliable work. As Mr Chandless remarks in his preface, even at that date, 'fictions enough have been written about the Mormons;' but it does not appear that his own work is less fictitious than those of which he complains. There are chapters about religion, government, settlements, morals, institutions, and some that appear to be about nothing in particular, unless it be Mr Chandless. Nevertheless, items of interest may be gleaned from them, as the author made a tour of the principal counties in 1855, and travellers in those parts were rare at this period. After informing us where he slept, and where he dined, and what he had for dinner, he occasionally finds time to tell us something about the condition of the settlements through which he journeyed.</P>

Describing one of his addresses, he writes: 'Brigham Young removed his hat, advanced to the end of the tribune, and leaning slightly forward upon both hands, propped on the green baize of the tribune, addressed his followers. The discourse began slowly, word crept titubantly after word, and the opening phrases were hardly audible; but as the orator warmed, his voice rose high and sonorous, and a fluency so remarkable succeeded falter and hesitation, that although the phenomenon is not rare in strong speakers, the latter seemed almost to have been a work of art. The manner was pleasing and animated, and the matter fluent, impromptu, and well turned, spoken rather than preached; if it had a fault, it was rather rambling and disconnected&#8230;The gestures were easy and rounded, not without a certain grace, though evidently untaught; one, however, must be excepted, namely that of raising the forefinger&#8230;The address was long. God is a mechanic. Mormonism is a great fact. Religion has made him, the speaker, the happiest of men. He was ready to dance like a shaker.

Circleville, in what is now Piute co., was settled about the same time, several previous attempts having failed, on account of trouble with Indians. In the same year, also, Fort Gunnison was founded in the south-western part of San Pete co. In 1861 it was organized as a ward, with Jacob Kudger-son as bishop.

Also an Authentic History of the Latter-Day Saints&#8217; Emigration from Europe from the Commencement up to the Close of 1855, with Statistics. Edited by James Linforth</i>. Liverpool and London, 1855. Though this book was written mainly for the purpose of giving a review of the latter-day saints&#8217; emigration from Liverpool to Salt Lake City, together with statistics to date, it contains much historical and statistical information on other subjects, drawn, as the editor says, 'from sources far and wide.' Mr Linforth acknowledges that he was assisted in his work by missionaries, whose position and acquaintance with affairs gave him access to many valuable documents. In chap. xvii., we find a description of Nauvoo, of the Carthage-jail tragedy, the persecutions in Missouri and Illinois, and many details concerning the life of the prophet. In chaps xxi.-xxii. is an account of the territory and its settlements, and the industrial condition of the saints. In the last chapters are brief biographies of some of the leading elders. All of this information is contained in notes, the text merely relating the travels of the artists by whom the sketches were made. The engravings are well executed, and among them are portraits of several church dignitaries.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A Journey to Great Salt Lake City, by Jules Remy and Julius Brenchley, M. A.: With a Sketch of the History, Religion, and Customs of the Mormons, and an introduction on the Religious Movement in the United States, by Jules Remy</i>. 2 vols. London, 1861. In addition to incidents of travel and descriptions of the places visited, we have in these volumes a sketch of Mormon history to 1859, together with chapters on the Mormon church and hierarchy, polygamy, education, and propagandism. At one time it was considered the standard gentile authority on Mormonism, and is freely quoted by other writers, though greatly inferior to Burton's work published two years later. 'The greater part of the matter,' remarks the author, 'was written from day to day, often in the open air, upon the slopes or the crests of mountains, in the heart of deserts, among the occupations and frequently the perils which are the necessary accompaniments of so long a journey.' Hence Mr Remy lays no claim to literary finish, a defect which he hopes may be atoned for by superior accuracy. Though there are many interesting passages and some interesting chapters, one cannot but feel that he might have said twice as much in half the space.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Husband in Utah; or Sights and Scenes among the Mormons: With Remarks on their Moral and Social Economy, by Austin N. Ward</i>. Edited by Maria Ward. New York, 1857. Here and there in this work will be found some interesting sketches of Mormon life as Mrs Ward observed it in 1855. Among them are descriptions of the industrial and social condition of the Mormons, the stores, manufactures, streets, street scenes, costumes, the theatre, the tabernacle. In style the work is sketchy and entertaining, and written in more friendly mood than could be expected from one who, as Mrs Ward declares, 'escaped from Mormondom.' At the end of the work is <a name="page_603"><font size="1" color="green">p. 603</font></A> 'Joseph's Smith's revelation on polygamy,' and several discourses by leading elders. Another edition was issued in 1863, under title of <i>Male Life among the Mormons</i>.</P>
