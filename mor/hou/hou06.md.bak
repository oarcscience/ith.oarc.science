    <span class="smallcaps">Let</span> us turn now to the east, where
have been evolving these several years a new phase of society and a new
religion, destined presently to enter in and take possession of this
far-away primeval wilderness. For it is not alone by the power of things
material that the land of the Yutas is to be subdued; that mysterious
agency, working under pressure of high enthusiasm in the souls of men,
defying exposure, cold, and hunger, defying ignominy, death, and the
destruction of all corporeal things in the hope of heaven's favors and a
happy immortality, a puissance whose very breath of life is persecution,
and whose highest glory is martyrdom—it is through this subtile and
incomprehensible spiritual instrumentality, rather than from a desire
for riches or any tangible advantage that the new Israel is to arise,
the new exodus to be conducted, the new Canaan to be attained.

    Sixty years ago western New York was essentially a new country, Ohio
and Illinois were for the most

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

part a wilderness, and Missouri was the United States limit, the lands
beyond being held by the aborigines. There were some settlements between
Lake Erie and the Mississippi River, but they were recent and rude, and
the region was less civilized than savage. The people, though
practically shrewd and of bright intellect, were ignorant; though having
within them the elements of wealth, they were poor. There was among them
much true religion, whatever that may be, yet they were all
superstitious—baptists, methodists, and presbyterians; there was little
to choose between them. Each sect was an abomination to the others; the
others were of the devil, doomed to eternal torments, and deservedly so.
The bible was accepted literally by all, every word of it, prophecies,
miracles, and revelations; the same God and the same Christ satisfied
all; an infidel was a thing woful and unclean. All the people reasoned.
How they racked their brains in secret, and poured forth loud logic in
public, not over problems involving intellectual liberty, human rights
and reason, and other like insignificant matters appertaining to this
world, but concerning the world to come, and more particularly such
momentous questions as election, justification, baptism, and infant
damnation. Then of signs and seasons, God's ways and Satan's ways;
likewise concerning promises and prayer, and all the rest, there was a
credulity most refreshing. In the old time there were prophets and
apostles, there were visions and miracles; why should it not be so
during these latter days? It was time for Christ to come again, time for
the millennial season, and should the power of the almighty be limited?
There was the arch-fanatic Miller, and his followers, predicting the end
and planning accordingly. "The idea that revelation from God was
unattainable in this age, or that the ancient gifts of the gospel had
ceased forever, never entered my head," writes a young quaker; and a
methodist of that epoch says: "We believed in the gathering of Israel,
and in the restoration

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

of the ten tribes; we believed that Jesus would come to reign personally
on the earth; we believed that there ought to be apostles, prophets,
evangelists, pastors, and teachers, as in former days, and that the
gifts of healing and the power of God ought to be associated with the
church." These ideas, of course, were not held by all; in many respects
the strictly orthodox evangelical churches taught the contrary; but
there was enough of this literal interpretation and license of thought
among the people to enable them to accept in all honesty and sincerity
any doctrine in harmony with these views.

    Such were the people and the place, such the atmosphere and
conditions under which was to spring up the germ of a new theocracy,
destined in its development to accomplish the first settlement of Utah—a
people and an atmosphere already sufficiently charged, one would think,
with doctrines and dogmas, with vulgar folly and stupid fanaticism, with
unchristian hate and disputation over the commands of God and the
charity of Christ. All this must be taken into account in estimating
character, and in passing judgment on credulity; men of one time and
place cannot with justice be measured by the standard of other times and
places.

    Before entering upon the history of Mormonism, I would here remark,
as I have before said in the preface to this volume, that it is my
purpose to treat the subject historically, not as a social, political,
or religious partisan, but historically to deal with the sect organized
under the name of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as I
would deal with any other body of people, thus carrying over Utah the
same quality of work which I have applied to my entire field, whether in
Alaska, California, or Central America. Whatever they may be, howsoever
righteous or wicked, they are entitled at the hand of those desirous of
knowing the truth to a dispassionate and

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

respectful hearing, which they have never had. As a matter of course,
where there is such warmth of feeling, such bitterness and animosity as
is here displayed on both sides, we must expect to encounter in our
evidence much exaggeration, and many untruthful statements. Most that
has been written on either side is partisan—bitterly so; many of the
books that have been published are full of vile and licentious
abuse—disgustingly so. Some of the more palpable lies, some of the
grosser scurrility and more blasphemous vulgarity, I shall omit
altogether.

    Again, the history of the Mormons, which is the early history of
Utah, is entitled in its treatment to this consideration, as differing
from that of other sections of my work, and to this only—that whereas in
speaking of other and older sects, as of the catholics in Mexico and
California, and of the methodists and presbyterians in Oregon, whose
tenets having long been established, are well known, and have no
immediate bearing aside from the general influence of religion upon the
subjugation of the country, any analysis of doctrines would be out of
place, such analysis in the present instance is of primary importance.
Ordinarily, I say, as I have said before, that with the religious
beliefs of the settlers on new lands, or of the builders of empire in
any of its several phases, social and political, the historian has
nothing to do, except in so far as belief influences actions and events.
As to attempting to determine the truth or falsity of any creed, it is
wholly outside of his province.

    Since the settlement of Utah grew immediately out of the persecution
of the Mormons, and since their persecutions grew out of the doctrines
which they promulgated, it seems to me essential that the origin and
nature of their religion should be given. And as they are supposed to
know better than others what they believe and how they came so to
believe, I shall let them tell their own story of the rise and progress
of their religion, carrying along with it the commentaries

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

of their opponents; that is, giving in the text the narrative proper,
and in the notes further information, elucidation, and
counter-statements, according to my custom. All this by no means
implies, here or elsewhere in my work, that when a Mormon elder, a
catholic priest, or a baptist preacher says he had a vision, felt within
him some supernatural influence, or said a prayer which produced a
certain result, it is proper or relevant for me to stop and dispute with
him whether he really did see, feel, or experience as alleged.

    As to the material facts connected with the story of Mormonism,
there is but little difference between the Mormons and their opposers;
but in the reception and interpretation of acts and incidents,
particularly in the acceptation of miraculous assertions and spiritual
manifestations, they are as widely apart as the two poles, as my text
and notes clearly demonstrate. And finally, I would have it clearly
understood that it is my purpose, here as elsewhere in all my historical
efforts, to impart information rather than attempt to solve problems.

    In Sharon, Windsor county, Vermont, on the 23d of December, 1805,
was born Joseph Smith junior, presently to be called translator,
revelator, seer, prophet, and founder of a latter-day dispensation. When
the boy was ten years old, his father, who was a farmer, moved with his
family to Palmyra, Wayne county, New York, and four years afterward took
up his abode some six miles south, at Manchester, Ontario county. Six
sons and three daughters comprised the family of Joseph and Lucy Smith,
namely, Alvin, Hyrum, Joseph junior, Samuel Harrison, William, Don
Carlos, Sophronia, Catharine, and Lucy. <span
id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md)

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

There was much excitement over the subject of religion in this section
at the time, with no small discussion of doctrines, methodist, baptist,
and the rest; and about a year later, the mother and four of the
children joined the presbyterians.

    But young Joseph was not satisfied with any of the current
theologies, and he was greatly troubled what to do. Reading his bible
one day, he came upon the passage, "If any of you lack wisdom, let him
ask of God." He retired to the woods and threw himself upon his knees.
It was his first attempt at prayer.

    While thus engaged a vision fell upon him. Suddenly he was seized by
some supernatural power of evil import, which bound him body and soul.
He could not think; he could not speak; thick darkness gathered round.
Presently there appeared above his head a pillar of light, which slowly
descended and enveloped him. Immediately he was delivered from the
enemy; and in the sky he saw two bright personages, one of whom said,
pointing to the other, "This is my beloved son; hear him." Then he asked
what he should do; to which sect he should unite himself.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

And he was told to join none of them, that all were corrupt, all were
abomination in the eyes of the Lord. When he came to himself he was
still gazing earnestly up into heaven. This was in the spring of 1820,
and Joseph was yet scarcely fifteen.

    When the young prophet began to proclaim his vision, the wise men
and preachers of the several sects laughed at him; called him a silly
boy, and told him that if his mind had really been disturbed. it was the
devil's doing. "Signs and revelations," said they, "are of by-gone
times; it ill befits one so young to lie before God and in the presence
of his people." "Nevertheless," replied Joseph, "I have had a vision."
Then they reviled him, and the boy became disheartened and was entangled
again in the vanities of the world, under the heavy hand of their
oppression.

    But the spirit of the Lord could not thus be quenched. The young man
repented, and sought and found forgiveness. Retiring to his bed, midst
prayer and supplication, on the night of September 21, 1823, presently
the room grew light, and a figure robed in exceeding whiteness stood by
the bedside, the feet not touching the floor. And a voice was heard,
saying, "I am Moroni, and am come to you, Joseph, as a messenger from
God." Then the angel told the youth that the Lord had for him a great
work to do, that his name should be known to all people, and of him
should be spoken both good and evil. He told him of a book written on
plates of gold, and containing an account of the early inhabitants of
this continent, and the gospel as delivered to them by Christ. He said
that deposited with those plates were two stones in silver bows, which,
fastened to a breastplate, constituted the Urim and Thummim; and that
now as in ancient times the possession and use of the stones constituted
a seer, and that through them the book might be translated. After
offering many scriptural quotations from both the old and the new
testament, and charging the young man that when the book and the
breastplate were delivered

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

to him he should show them to no one, under pain of death and
destruction—the place where the plates were deposited meanwhile being
clearly revealed to his mental vision—the light in the room grew dim, as
Moroni ascended along a pathway of glory into heaven, and finally
darkness was there as before. The visit was made three times, the last
ending with the dawn, when Joseph arose greatly exhausted and went into
the field to work.

    His father, observing his condition, sent him home; but on the way
Joseph fell in a state of unconsciousness to the ground. Soon, however,
the voice of Moroni was heard, commanding him to return to his father,
and tell him all that he had seen and heard. The young man obeyed. The
father answered that it was of God; the son should do as the messenger
had said. Then Joseph, knowing from the vision where the plates were
bidden, went to the west side of a hill, called the hill Cumorah, near
the town of Manchester, and beneath a large stone, part of whose top
appeared above the ground, in a stone box, <span
id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md) he found the plates, <span
id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_43.md) the urim and

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

thummim, <span id="fr_44"></span>[4](#fn_44.md) and the breastplate. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[5](#fn_45.md) But when he was about to take them out
Moroni stood beside him and said, "Not yet; meet me here at this time
each year for four years, and I will tell you what to do." Joseph
obeyed.

    The elder Smith was poor, and the boys were sometimes obliged to
hire themselves out as laborers. It was on the 22d of September, 1823,
that the plates were found. The following year Alvin died, and in
October 1825 Joseph went to work for Josiah Steal, in Chenango county.
This man had what he supposed to be a silver mine at Harmony,
Pennsylvania, said to have been once worked by Spaniards. Thither Joseph
went with the other men to dig for silver, <span
id="fr_46"></span>[6](#fn_46.md)

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

boarding at the house of Isaac Hale. After a month's fruitless effort
Stoal was induced by Joseph to abandon the undertaking; but meanwhile
the youth had fallen in love with Hale's pretty daughter, Emma, and
wished to marry her. Hale objected, owing to his continued assertions
that he had seen visions, and the resulting persecutions; so Joseph took
Emma to the house of Squire Tarbill, at South Bainbridge, where they
were married the 18th of January, 1827, and thence returned to his
father's farm, where he worked during the following season. <span
id="fr_47"></span>[7](#fn_47.md)

     Every year went Joseph to the hill Cumorah to hold communion with
the heavenly messenger, and on the 22d of September, 1827, Moroni
delivered to him the plates, <span id="fr_48"></span>[8](#fn_48.md) and the
urim and thummim with which to translate them, charging him on pain of
dire disaster

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

to guard them well until he should call for them. Persecutions increased
when it was known that Joseph had in his possession the plates of gold,
and every art that Satan could devise or put in force through the agency
of wicked men was employed to

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

wrest them from him. But almighty power and wisdom prevailed, and the
sacred relies were safely kept till the day the messenger called for
them, when they were delivered into his hands, Joseph meanwhile haying
accomplished by them all that was required of him.

     And now so fierce becomes the fiery malevolence of the enemy that
Joseph is obliged to fly. <span id="fr_49"></span>[9](#fn_49.md) He is very
poor, having absolutely nothing, until a farmer named Martin Harris has
pity on him and gives him fifty dollars, <span
id="fr_50"></span>[10](#fn_50.md) with which he is enabled to go with his
wife to her old home in Pennsylvania. <span
id="fr_51"></span>[11](#fn_51.md) Immediately after his arrival there in
December, he begins copying the

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

characters on the plates, Martin Harris coming to his assistance, and by
means of the urim and thummim manages to translate some of them, which
work is continued till February 1828. Harris' wife is exceedingly
curious about the matter, and finally obtains possession through her
husband of a portion of the manuscript. <span
id="fr_52"></span>[12](#fn_52.md) About this time Harris takes a copy

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

of some of the characters to New York city, where he submits them to the
examination of Professor Anthon and Dr Mitchell, who pronounce them to
be Egyptian, Syriac, Chaldaic, and Arabic. <span
id="fr_53"></span>[13](#fn_53.md) Then

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Joseph buys of his
wife's father a small farm and goes to work on it. In February 1829 he
receives a visit from his own father, at which time a revelation comes
to Joseph Smith senior, through the son, calling him to faith and good
works. The month following Martin Harris asks for and receives a
revelation, by the mouth of the latter, regarding the plates, wherein
the said Harris is told that Joseph has in his possession the plates
which he claims to have, that they were delivered to him by the Lord
God, who likewise gave him power to translate them, and that he, Harris,
should bear witness of the same. Three months later, Harris having
meanwhile acted as his scribe, Joseph is commanded to rest for a season
in his work of translating until directed to take it up again.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

    The tenor of the book of Mormon <span id="fr_54"></span>[14](#fn_54.md)
is in this wise: Following the confusion of tongues at the tower of
Babel, the peoples of the earth were scattered abroad, one colony being
led by the Lord across the ocean to America. Fifteen hundred years
after, or six hundred years before Christ, they were destroyed for their
wickedness. Of the original number was Jared, among whose descendants
was the prophet Ether, who was their historian. Ether lived to witness
the extinction of his nation, and under divine direction he deposited
his history in a locality where it was found by a second colony,
Israelites of the tribe of Joseph, who came from Jerusalem about the
time of the destruction of the first colony, namely, six hundred years
before Christ. Thus was America repeopled; the second colony occupied
the site of the first, multiplied and became rich, and in time divided
into two nations, the Nephites and the Lamanites, so called from their
respective founders, Nephi and Laman. The former advanced in
civilization, but the Lamanites lapsed into barbarism, and were the
immediate progenitors of the American aboriginals.

    The Nephites were the beloved of the Lord. To them were given
visions and angels' visits; to them the Christ appeared with gifts of
gospel and prophecy. It was, indeed, the golden age of a favored people;
but in a time of temptation, some three or four centuries after Christ,
they fell, and were destroyed by

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

the wicked Lamanites. The greatest prophet of the Nephites, in the
period of their declension, was Mormon, their historian, who after
having completed his abridgment of the records of his nation, committed
it to his son Moroni, and he, that they might not fall into the hands of
the Lamanites, deposited them in the hill of Cumorah, where they were
found by Joseph Smith.

 

    On the 5th of April, 1829, there comes to Joseph Smith a
school-teacher, Oliver Cowdery by name, to whom the Lord had revealed
himself at the house of the elder Smith, where the teacher had been
boarding. Inquiring of the Lord, Joseph is told that to Oliver shall be
given the same power to translate the book of Mormon, <span
id="fr_55"></span>[15](#fn_55.md) by which term the writing on

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

the golden plates is hereafter known, and that he also shall bear
witness to the truth.

    Two days after the arrival of Oliver, <span
id="fr_56"></span>[16](#fn_56.md) Joseph and he begin the work
systematically, the former translating while the latter writes; <span
id="fr_57"></span>[17](#fn_57.md) for Oliver has a vision, meanwhile,

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

telling him not to exercise his gift of translating at present, but
simply to write at Joseph's dictation. Continuing thus, on the 15th of
May the two men go into the woods to ask God concerning baptism, found
mentioned in the plates. Presently a messenger descends from heaven in a
cloud of light. It is John the Baptist. And he ordains them, saying,
"Upon you, my fellow-servants, in the name of messiah, I confer the
priesthood of Aaron." Baptism by immersion is directed; the power of
laying-on of hands for the gift of the holy ghost is promised, but not
now bestowed; then they are commanded to be baptized, each one baptizing
the other, which is done, each in turn laying his hands upon the head of
the other, and ordaining him to the Aaronic priesthood. As they come up
out of the water the holy ghost falls upon them, and they prophesy.

    Persecutions continue; brethren of Christ threaten to mob them, but
Joseph's wife's father promises protection. Samuel Smith comes, and is
converted, receiving baptism and obtaining revelations; and later
Joseph's father and mother, Martin Harris, and others. Food is several
times charitably brought to the translators by Joseph Knight, senior, of
Colesville, New York, concerning whom is given a revelation. In June
comes David Whitmer with a request from his father, Peter Whitmer, of
Fayette, New York, that the translators should occupy his house
thenceforth until the completion of their work, and brings with him a
two-horse wagon to carry them and their effects. Not only is their board
to be free, but one of the brothers Whitmer, of whom there are David,
John, and Peter junior, will assist in the writing. Thither they go, and
find all as promised; David and Peter Whitmer and Hyrum Smith are
baptized, and receive revelations through Joseph, who inquires of the
Lord for them by means of the urim and thummim. The people thereabout
being friendly, meetings are held, and the new revelation taught, many
believing,

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

certain priests and others disputing. Three special witnesses are
provided by Christ, namely, Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin
Harris, <span id="fr_58"></span>[18](#fn_58.md) to whom the plates are
shown by an angel after much prayer and meditation in the woods. These
are the three witnesses. And there are further eight witnesses, namely,
Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Peter Whitmer junior, John Whitmer,
Hiram Page, Joseph Smith senior, Hyrum Smith, and Samuel H. Smith, who
testify that the plates were shown to them by Joseph Smith junior, that
they handled them with their hands, and saw the characters engraven
thereon. <span id="fr_59"></span>[19](#fn_59.md)

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

    The translation of the book of Mormon being finished, Smith and
Cowdery go to Palmyra, secure the copyright, and agree with Egbert B.
Grandin to print five thousand copies for three thousand dollars.
Meanwhile, a revelation comes to Martin Harris, at Manchester, in March,
commanding him to pay for the printing of the book of Mormon, under
penalty of destruction of himself and property. <span
id="fr_60"></span>[20](#fn_60.md) The title-page

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

is not a modern production, but a literal translation from the last leaf
of the plates, on the left-hand side, and running like all Hebrew
writing.

    And now in a chamber of Whitmer's house Smith, Cowdery, and David
Whitmer meet, and earnestly ask God to make good his promise, and confer
on them the Melchisedec priesthood, which authorizes the laying-on of
hands for the gift of the holy ghost. Their prayer is answered; for
presently the word of the Lord comes to them, commanding that Joseph
Smith should ordain Oliver Cowdery to be an elder in the church of Jesus
Christ, and Oliver in like manner should so ordain Joseph, and the two
should ordain others as from time to time the will of the Lord should be
made known to them. <span id="fr_61"></span>[21](#fn_61.md) But this
ordination must not take place until the baptized brethren assemble and
give to this act their sanction, and accept the ordained as spiritual
teachers, and then only after the blessing and partaking of bread and
wine. It is next revealed that twelve shall be called to be the
disciples of Christ, the twelve apostles of these last days, who shall
go into all the world preaching and baptizing.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> By the spirit of
prophecy and revelation it is done. The rise of the church of Jesus
Christ in these last days is on the 6th of April, 1830, at which date
the church was organized under the provisions of the statutes of the
state of New York by Joseph Smith junior, Hyrum Smith, Oliver Cowdery,
David Whitmer, Samuel H. Smith, and Peter Whitmer. Joseph Smith,
ordained an apostle of Jesus Christ, is made by the commandment of God
the first elder of this church, and Oliver Cowdery, likewise an apostle,
is made the second elder. Again the first elder falls into worldly
entanglements, but upon repentance and self-humbling he is delivered by
an angel.

    The duties of elders, priests, teachers, deacons, and members are as
follow: All who desire it, with honesty and humility, may be baptized
into the church; old covenants are at an end, all must be baptized anew.
An apostle is an elder; he shall baptize, ordain other elders, priests,
teachers, and deacons, administer bread and wine, emblems of the flesh
and blood of Christ; he shall confirm, teach, expound, exhort, taking
the lead at meetings, and conducting them as he is taught by the holy
ghost. The priest's duty is to preach, teach, expound, exhort, baptize,
administer the sacrament, and visit and pray with members; he may also
ordain other priests, teachers, and deacons, giving a certificate of
ordination, and lead in meetings when no elder is present. The teacher's
duty is to watch over and strengthen the members, preventing evil
speaking and all iniquity, to see that the meetings are regularly held,
and to take the lead in them in the absence of elder or priest. The
deacon's duty is to assist the teacher; teacher and deacon may warn,
expound, exhort, but neither of them shall baptize, administer the
sacrament, or lay on hands. The elders are to meet in council for the
transaction of church business every three months, or oftener should
meetings be called. Subordinate officers will receive from the elders a
license defining their authority; elders will

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

receive their license from other elders by vote of church or conference.
There shall be presidents, bishops, high counsellors, and high priests;
the presiding elder shall be president of the high priesthood, and he,
as well as bishops, high counsellors, and high priests, will be ordained
by high council or general conference. The duty of members is to walk in
holiness before the Lord according to the scriptures, to bring their
children to the elders, who will lay their hands on them and bless them
in the name of Jesus Christ. The bible, that is to say, the scriptures
of the old and new testaments, is accepted wholly, save such corruptions
as have crept in through the great and abominable church; the book of
Mormon is a later revelation, supplementary thereto. Thus is organized
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, <span
id="fr_62"></span>[22](#fn_62.md) in accordance with special revelations
and commandments, and after the manner set forth in the new testament.

    The first public discourse, following the meetings held in Whitmer's
house, was preached on Sunday, the 11th of April, 1830, by Oliver
Cowdery, who the

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

same day baptized in Seneca Lake several persons, among whom were Hyrum
and Katherine Page, some of the Whitmers, and the Jolly family. The
first miracle likewise occurred during the same month, Joseph Smith
casting out a devil from Newel Knight, son of Joseph Knight, who with
his family had been universalists. Newel had been a constant attendant
at the meetings, and was much interested; but when he attempted to pray
the devil prevented him, writhing his limbs into divers distortions, and
hurling him about the room. "I know that you can deliver me from this
evil spirit," cried Newel. Whereupon Joseph rebuked the devil in the
name of Jesus Christ, and the evil spirit departed from the young man.
Seeing this, others came forward and expressed their belief in the new
faith, and a church was established at Colesville.

    On the 1st of June the first conference as an organized church was
held, there being thirty members. The meeting was opened by singing and
prayer, after which they partook of the sacrament, which was followed by
confirmations and further ordinations to the several offices of the
priesthood. The exercises were attended by the outpouring of the holy
ghost, and many prophesied, to the infinite joy and gratification of the
elders. Some time after, on a Saturday previous to an appointed sabbath
on which baptism was to be performed, the brethren constructed, across a
stream of water, a dam, which was torn away by a mob during the night.
The meeting was held, however, though amid the sneers and insults of the
rabble, Oliver preaching. Present among others was Emily Coburn, Newel
Knight's wife's sister, formerly a presbyterian. Her pastor, the Rev. Mr
Shearer, arrived, and tried to persuade her to return to her father.
Failing in this, he obtained from her father a power of attorney, and
bore her off by force; but Emily returned. The dam was repaired, and
baptism administered to some thirteen persons the following morning;
whereupon fifty

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

men surrounded Mr Knight's house, threatening violence. The same night
Joseph was arrested by a constable on a charge of disorderly conduct,
and for preaching the book of Mormon. It was the purpose of the populace
to capture Joseph from the constable and use him roughly, but by hard
driving he escaped. At the trial which followed, an attempt was made to
prove certain charges, namely, that he obtained a horse from Josiah
Stoal, and a yoke of oxen from Jonathan Thompson, by saying that in a
revelation he was told that he was to have them; also as touching his
conduct toward two daughters of Mr Stoal; but all testified in his
favor, and he was acquitted. As he was leaving the court-room, he was
again arrested on a warrant from Broome county, and taken midst insults
and buffetings to Colesville for trial. The old charges were renewed,
and new ones preferred. Newel Knight was made to testify regarding the
miracle wrought in his behalf, and a story that the prisoner had been a
money digger was advanced by the prosecution. Again he was acquitted,
and again escaped from the crowd outside the court-house, whose purpose
it was to tar and feather him, and ride him on a rail. These
persecutions were instigated, it was said, chiefly by presbyterians.

    While Joseph rested at his home at Harmony further stories were
circulated, damaging to his character, this time by the methodists. One
went to his father-in-law with falsehoods, and so turned him and his
family against Joseph and his friends that he would no longer afford
them protection or receive their doctrine. This was a heavy blow; but
proceeding in August to Colesville, Joseph and Hyrum Smith and John and
David Whitmer continued the work of prayer and confirmation. Fearing
their old enemies, who lay in wait to attack them on their way back,
they prayed that their eyes might be blinded; and so it came to pass.
Then they held service and returned safely, although five dollars reward
had been offered

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

for notification of their arrival. Removing his family to Fayette,
Joseph encountered further persecutions, to which was added a fresh
grief. Hiram Page was going astray over a stone which he had found, and
by means of which he had obtained revelations at variance with Joseph's
revelations and the rules of the new testament. It was thought best not
to agitate the subject unnecessarily, before the meeting of the
conference to be held on the 1st of September; but the Whitmer family
and Oliver Cowdery seeming to be too greatly impressed over the things
set forth by the rival stone, it was resolved to inquire of the Lord
concerning the matter; whereupon a revelation came to Oliver Cowdery,
forbidding such practice; and he was to say privately to Hiram Page that
Satan had deceived him, and that the things which he had written from
the stone were not of God. Oliver was further commanded to go and preach
the gospel to the Lamanites, <span id="fr_63"></span>[23](#fn_63.md) the
remnants of the house of Joseph living in the west, <span
id="fr_64"></span>[24](#fn_64.md) where he was to establish

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

a church and build a city, <span id="fr_65"></span>[25](#fn_65.md) at a
point to be designated later.

    "Behold, I say unto thee, Oliver, that it shall be given unto thee
that thou shalt be heard by the church in all things whatsoever thou
shalt teach them by the comforter concerning. the revelations and
commandments which I have given. But behold, verily, verily, I say unto
thee, no one shall be appointed to receive commandments and revelations
in this church, excepting my servant Joseph Smith, Jr, for he receiveth
them even as Moses; and thou shalt be obedient unto the things which I
shall give unto him, even as Aaron, to declare faithfully the
commandments and the revelations with power and authority unto the
church. And if thou art led at any time by the comforter to speak or
teach, or at all times by the way of commandment unto the church, thou
mayest do it. But thou shalt not write by way of commandment, but by
wisdom; and thou shalt not command him who is at thy head and at the
head of the church; for I have given him the keys of the mysteries and
the revelations which are sealed, until I shall appoint unto them
another in his stead."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_41"></span>[40:1](hou06.htm#fr_41.md) Much has been said by
the enemies of Mormonism against the Smith family. 'All who became
intimate with them during this period \[1820 to 1830\] unite in
representing the general character of old Joseph and wife, the parents
of the pretended prophet, as lazy, indolent, ignorant, and
superstitious, <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> having a firm belief in
ghosts and witches; the telling of fortunes; pretending to believe that
the earth was filled with hidden treasures, buried there by Kid or the
Spaniards. Being miserably poor, and not much disposed to obtain an
honest livelihood by labor, the energies of their minds seemed to be
mostly directed toward finding where these treasures were concealed, and
the best mode of acquiring their possession.' *Howe's Mormonism
Unveiled*, 11. In the towns of Palmyra and Manchester, in 1833,
documents defamatory to the family were circulated for signature, one
receiving 11 and another 51 names. Given with signatures in *Howe's
Mormonism Unveiled*, 251-2, and in *Kidder's Mormonism*, 20-1. See also
*Olshausen, Gesch. d. Morm*., 9-14, 103-10, 200-1; *Gazette of Utah,
1874*, 17; *Tucker's Origin and Prog. Mor*., 11-20. In one of these
documents, signed and sworn to by Peter Ingersoll, he said that the
Smith family employed most of their time in gold-digging. At one time
Joseph Smith senior told Ingersoll to hold a mineral rod in his hand, a
piece of witch-hazel, and selected a place to stand where he was to
whisper directions to the rod; Smith stood apart, throwing himself into
various shapes, but was unable to produce the desired effect. Again he
took a stone that Ingersoll had picked up and exclaimed that it was
invaluable; looking at it earnestly, he said it revealed to him chests
of gold and silver at the back of his house; and putting it into his
hat, threw himself into various attitudes, and soon appeared exhausted;
then in a faint voice, said, 'If you only knew what I had seen you would
believe.' Some time before Joseph's discovery of the gold plates, the
elder Smith told Ingersoll that a book had been found in Canada in a
hollow tree which treated of the discovery of this continent.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[43:2](hou06.htm#fr_42.md) Oliver Cowdery stated
that he visited the spot, and that 'at the bottom of this \[hole\] lay a
stone of suitable size, the upper surface being smooth. At each edge was
placed a large quantity of cement and into this cement at the four edges
of this stone were placed erect four others, their lower edges resting
in the cement at the outer edges of the first stone. The four last named
when placed erect formed a box, the corners, or where the edges of the
four came in contact, were also cemented so firmly that the moisture
from without was prevented from entering. It is to be observed also that
the inner surfaces of the four erect or side stones were smooth. The box
was sufficiently large to admit a breastplate. From the bottom of the
box or from the breastplate arose three small pillars, composed of the
same description of cement as that used on the edges; and upon these
three pillars were placed the records. The box containing the records
was covered with another stone, the lower surface being flat and the
upper crowning.' *Mackay's The Mormons*, 20.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[43:3](hou06.htm#fr_43.md) Orson Pratt thus
describes the plates, *Visions*, 14: 'These records were engraved on
plates which had the appearance of gold. Each plate was not far from
seven by eight inches in width and length, being not quite as thick as
common tin. They were filled on both sides with engravings in Egyptian
characters, and bound together in a volume, as the leaves of a book, and
fastened at one edge with three rings running through the whole. This
volume was about six inches in thickness, and a part of it was sealed.
the characters or letters upon the unsealed part were small and
beautifully engraved. The whole book exhibited many marks of antiquity
in its construction, as well <span id="page_44">p. 44</span> as much
skill in the art of engraving.' In the introduction to the *Book of
Mormon* (New York ed.), viii., is given essentially the same
description. See also *Bonwick's Mormons and Silver Mines*, 61;
*Bertrand, Mem. d'un Mor*., 25; *Olshausen, Gesch. d. Morm*., 12-29;
*Stenhouse, Les Mormons*, i.-vii.; *Ferris’ Utah and The Mormons*, 58;
*Mackay's The Mormons*, 15-22; *Smucker's Hist. Mormons*, 13-28. For
facsimile of writing on golden plates, see *Beadle's Life in Utah*, 25.
For illustrations of the hill, finding the plates, etc., see *Mackay's
The Mormons*, 15; *Smucker's Hist. Mormons*, 24; *Tucker's Origin and
Prog. Mor*., frontispiece. When sceptics ask, Why are not the plates
forthcoming? believers ask in turn, Why are not forthcoming the stone
tables of Moses? And yet the ten commandments are to-day accepted.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[44:4](hou06.htm#fr_44.md) 'With the book were
found the urim and thummim, two transparent crystals set in the rims of
a bow. These pebbles were the seer's instrument whereby the mystery of
hidden things was to be revealed!' Introduction to *Book of Mormon* (New
York ed.), viii. 'The best attainable definition of the ancient urim and
thummim is quite vague and indistinct. An accepted biblical
lexicographer gives the meaning as "light and perfection," or the
"shining and the perfect." The following is quoted from *Butterworth's
Concordance*: "There are various conjectures about the urim and thummim,
whether they were the stones in the high-priest's breastplate, or
something distinct from them; which it is not worth our while to inquire
into, since God has left it a secret. It is evident that the urim and
thummim were appointed to inquire of God by, on momentous occasions, and
continued in use, as some think, only till the building of Solomon's
temple, and all conclude that this was never restored after its
destruction."' *Tucker's Origin and Prog. Mor*., 32.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[44:5](hou06.htm#fr_45.md) 'A breastplate such as
was used by the ancients to defend the chest from the arrows and weapons
of their enemy.' *Mackay's The Mormons*, 20.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[44:6](hou06.htm#fr_46.md) 'Hence arose the very
prevalent story of my having been a money digger.' *Hist. Joseph Smith*,
in *Times and Seasons*, May 2, 1842. It seems from this, or some other
cause, that the followers of Smith have never regarded mining with
favor, although some of them at times have engaged in that occupation.
Upon the discovery of gold in California, the Mormons were among the
first in the field, at Coloma, at Mormon Bar, and elsewhere. Left there
a little longer, they would soon have gathered barrels of the precious
dust; but promptly upon the call they dropped their tools, abandoned
their brilliant prospects, and crossing the Sierra, began to build homes
among their people in the untenanted desert.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[45:7](hou06.htm#fr_47.md) Among the many charges
of wrong-doing ascribed to Smith from first to last, was that of having
stolen Hale's daughter. In answer it is said that the young woman was of
age, and had the right to marry whom and as she chose.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[45:8](hou06.htm#fr_48.md) 'When the appointed hour
came, the prophet, assuming his practised air of mystery, took in hand
his money-digging spade and a large napkin, and went off in silence and
alone in the solitude of the forest, and after an absence of some three
hours, returned, apparently with his sacred charge concealed within the
folds of the napkin. Reminding the (Smith) family of the original
"command" as revealed to him, strict injunction of non-intervention and
non-inspection was given to them, under the same terrible penalty as
before denounced for its violation. Conflicting stories were afterwards
told in regard to the manner of keeping the book in concealment and
safety, which are not worth repeating further than to mention that the
first place of secretion was said to be under a heavy hearthstone in the
Smith family mansion. Smith told a frightful story of the display of
celestial pyrotechnics on the exposure to his view of the sacred
book—the angel who had led him to the discovery again appearing as his
guide and protector, and confronting ten thousand devils gathered there,
with their menacing sulphurous flame and smoke, to deter him from his
purpose! This story was repeated and magnified by the believers, and no
doubt aided the experiment upon superstitious minds which eventuated so
successfully.' *Tucker's Orig. and Prog. Mor.*, 30-31. 'A great variety
of contradictory stories were related by the Smith family before they
had any fixed plan of operation, respecting the finding of the plates
from which their book was translated. One is, that after the plates were
taken from their hiding-place by Jo he again laid them down, looked into
the hole, where he saw a toad, which immediately transformed itself into
a spirit and gave him a tremendous blow. Another is, that after he had
got the plates, a spirit assaulted him with the intention of getting
them from his possession, and actually jerked them out of his hands. Jo,
nothing daunted, seized them again, and started to run, when his Satanic
majesty, or the spirit, applied his foot to the prophet's seat of honor
which raised three or four feet from the ground.' *Howe's Mormonism
Unveiled*, 275-6. The excavation was at the time said to be 160 feet in
extent, though that is probably an exaggeration. <span id="page_46">p.
46</span> It had a substantial door of two-inch plank, and a secure
lock. Lapse of time and other causes have almost effaced its existence.
*Tucker's Origin and Prog. Mor*., 48. 'In 1843, near Kinderhook,
Illinois, in excavating a large mound, six brass plates were discovered
of a bell-shape four inches in length and covered with ancient
characters. They were fastened together with two iron wires almost
entirely corroded, and were found along with charcoal, ashes, and human
bones, more than twelve feet below the surface of a mound of the
sugar-loaf form, common in the Mississippi Valley. Large trees growing
upon these artificial mounds attest their great antiquity…No key has yet
been discovered for the interpretation of the engravings upon these
brass plates, or of the strange gylphs upon the ruins of Otolum in
Mexico.' Daniel Wedderburn, in *Popular Science Monthly*, Dec. 1876; see
also *Times and Seasons*, iv. 186-7, and engraved cuts in *Taylor's
Discussions*, and in *Mackay's The Mormons*, 26-7. On the authority of
Kidder, *Mormonism*, 23-6, Willard Chase, a carpenter, said: 'In the
fore part of September (I believe) 1827, the prophet requested me to
make him a chest, informing me that he designed to move back to
Pennsylvania, and expecting soon to get his gold book, he wanted a chest
to lock it up, giving me to understand, at the same time, that if I
would make the chest he would give me a share in the book. I told him my
business was such that I could not make it; but if he would bring the
book to me, I would lock it up for him. He said that would not do, as he
was commanded to keep it two years without letting it come to the eye of
any one but himself. This commandment, however, he did not keep, for in
less than two years twelve men said they had seen it. I told him to get
it and convince me of its existence, and I would make him a chest; but
he said that would not do; as he must have a chest to lock the book in
as soon as he took it out of the ground. I saw him a fews days after,
when he told me I must make the chest. I told him plainly that I could
not, upon which he told me that I could have no share in the hook. A few
weeks after this conversation he came to my house and related the
following story: That on the 22d of September he arose early in the
morning and took a one-horse wagon of some one that had stayed over
night at their house, without leave or license; and, together with his
wife, repaired to the hill which contained the book. He left his wife in
the wagon, by the road, and went alone to the hill, a distance of thirty
or forty rods from the road; he said he then took the book out of the
ground and hid it in a tree-top and returned home. He then went to the
town of Macedon to work. After about ten days, it having been suggested
that some one had got his book, his wife went utter him; he hired a
horse, and went home in the afternoon, stayed long enough to drink one
cup of tea, and then went for his book, found it safe, took off his
frock, wrapt it round it, put it under his arm, and ran all the way
home, a distance of about two miles. He said he should think it would
weigh sixty pounds, and was sure it would weigh forty. On his return
home he said he was attacked by two men in the woods, and knocked them
both down and made his escape, arrived safe, and secured his treasure.
He then observed that if it had not been for that stone (which he
acknowledged belonged to me) he would not have obtained the book. A few
days afterward he told one of my neighbors that he had not got any such
book, and never had; but that he told the story to deceive the damned
fool (meaning me), to get him to make a chest.' Others give other
accounts, but it seems to me not worth while to follow them further.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[47:9](hou06.htm#fr_49.md) 'Soon the news of his
discoveries spread abroad throughout all those parts…The house was
frequently beset by mobs and evil-designing persons. Several times he
was shot at, and very narrowly escaped. Every device was used to get the
plates away from him. And being continually in danger of his life from a
gang of abandoned wretches, he at length concluded to leave the place,
and go to Pennsylvania; and accordingly packed up his goods, putting the
plates into a barrel of beans, and proceeded upon his journey. He had
not gone far before he was overtaken by an officer with a
search-warrant, who flattered himself with the idea that he should
surely obtain the plates; after searching very diligently, he was sadly
disappointed at not finding them. Mr Smith then drove on, but before he
got to his journey's end he was again overtaken by an officer on the
same business, and after ransacking the wagon very carefully, he went
his way as much chagrined as the first at not being able to discover the
object of his research. Without any further molestation, he pursued his
journey until he came to the northern part of Pennsylvania, near the
Susquehanna River, in which part his father-in-law resided.' *Pratt's
Visions*, 15.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[47:10](hou06.htm#fr_50.md) 'In the neighborhood
(of Smith's old home) there lived a farmer possessed of some money and
more credulity. Every wind of doctrine affected him. tie had been in
turn a quaker, a Wesleyan, a baptist, a presbyterian. His heterogeneous
and unsettled-views admirably qualified him for discipleship where
novelty was paramount, and concrete things were invested with the
enchantment of mystery. He was enraptured with the young prophet, and
offered him fifty dollars to aid in the publication of his new bible.'
*Tayldler's Mormons*, xxviii.-ix.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[47:11](hou06.htm#fr_51.md) 'Soon after Smith's
arrival at Harmony, Isaac Hale (Smith's father-in-law) heard he had
brought a wonderful box of plates with him. Hale "was shown a box in
which it is said they were contained, which had to all appearances been
used as a glass box of the common window-glass. I was allowed to feel
the weight of the box, and they gave me to understand that the book of
plates was then in the box—into which, however, I was not allowed to
look. I inquired of Joseph Smith, Jr., who was to be the first who would
be allowed to see the book of plates. He said it was a young child.
After this I became dissatisfied, and informed him that if there was
anything in my house of that description, which I could not be allowed
to see, he must take it away; if he did not, I was determined to see it.
After that the plates were said to be hid in the woods."' *Howe's
Mormonism Unveiled*, 264.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[48:12](hou06.htm#fr_52.md) Martin Harris 'says he
wrote a considerable part of the book as Smith dictated; and at one time
the presence of the Lord was so great that a screen was hung up between
him and the prophet; at earlier times the prophet would sit in a
different room, or up stairs, while the Lord was communicating to him
the contents of the plates. He does not pretend that he ever saw the
wonderful plates but once, although he and Smith were engaged for months
in deciphering their contents.' *Mormonism Unveiled*, 14. 'Harris
rendered Smith valuable assistance by transcribing for him, since he
could not write himself. Poor Martin was unfortunately gifted with a
troublesome wife. Her inquisitive and domineering nature made him dread
unpleasant results from his present engagement. His manuscript had
reached 116 pages, and he therefore begged permission to read it to her
"with the hope that it might have a salutary effect upon her feelings."
His request was at length granted; but through carelessness or perfidy,
while in his house, the precious document was irrecoverably lost. Joseph
suffered greatly in consequence of this hinderance, but more from the
anger of heaven which was manifested against him. As soon as possible,
he resumed his task, having secured the services of another scribe,
Oliver Cowdery, a school-master in the neighborhood. Martin Harris,
earnest as he was, had never yet been favored with a sight of the golden
plates. He had not attained to sufficient purity of mind; but a copy of
a small portion of their contents was placed in his hands, and this he
was told he might show to any scholar in the world, if he wished to be
satisfied. Accordingly he started for New York, sought Professor Anthon
(Charles Anthon, LL.D., then adjunct professor of ancient languages in
Columbia College), and requested his opinion.' *Taylder's Mormons*,
xxxviii.-ix. 'She (Harris's wife) contrived in her husband's sleep to
steal from him the particular source of her disturbance, and burned the
manuscript to ashes. For years she kept this incendiarism a profound
secret to herself, even until after the book was published. Smith and
Harris held her accountable for the theft, but supposed she had handed
the manuscript to some "evil-designing persons," to be used somehow in
injuring their cause. A feud was thus produced between husband and wife
which was never reconciled. Great consternation now pervaded the Mormon
circles. The reappearance of the mysterious stranger (who had before
visited the Smiths) was again the subject of inquiry and conjecture by
observers, from whom was withheld all explanation of his identity or
purpose. It was not at first an easy task to convince the prophet of the
entire innocency of his trusted friend Harris in the matter of tills
calamitous event, though mutual confidence and friendship were
ultimately restored.' *Tucker's Orig. and Prog. Mor*., 46. Of this lost
manuscript Smith afterward wrote: 'Some time after Mr Harris had begun
to write for me he began to tease me to give him liberty to carry the
writings home and show them, and desired of me that I would inquire of
the Lord through the urim and thummim if he might not do so.' To two
inquiries the reply was no, but a third application resulted in
permission being granted under certain restrictions, which were, that
Harris might show the papers to his brother, his wife, her sister, his
father and mother, and to no one else. Accordingly Smith required Harris
to bind himself in a covenant to him in the most solemn manner that he
would not do otherwise than had been directed. 'He <span id="page_49">p.
49</span> did so,' says Smith. 'He bound himself as I required of him,
took the writings, and went his way. Notwithstanding…he did show them to
others, and by stratagem they got them away from him.' *Smith*, in
*Times and Seasons*, iii. 785-6.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[49:13](hou06.htm#fr_53.md) In a letter to E. D.
Howe, printed in his book, and in the introduction to the New York
edition of the *Book of Mormon*, Prof. Anthon, among other statements,
denies that he ever gave a certificate. The letter reads as follows:

> 'NEW YORK, February 17, 1834.

    'DEAR SIR: I received your letter of the 9th, and lose no time in
making a reply. The whole story about my pronouncing the Mormon
inscription to be reformed Egyptian hierogylphies is perfectly false.
Some years ago, a plain, apparently simple-hearted farmer called on me
with a note from Dr Mitchell, of our city, now dead, requesting me to
decipher, if possible, the paper which the farmer would hand me. Upon
examining the paper in question, I soon came to the conclusion that it
was all a trick—perhaps a hoax. When I asked the person who brought it
how he obtained the writing, he gave me the following account: A gold
book consisting of a number of plates, fastened together by wires of the
same material, had been dug up in the northern part of the state of New
York, and along with it an enormous pair of spectacles. These spectacles
were so large that if any person attempted to look through them, his two
eyes would look through one glass only, the spectacles in question being
altogether too large for the human face. "Whoever," he said, "examined
the plates through the glasses was enabled not only to read them, but
fully to understand their meaning." All this knowledge, however, was
confined to a young man, who had the trunk containing the book and
spectacles in his sole possession. This young man was placed behind a
curtain in a garret in a farm-house, and being thus concealed from view,
he put on the spectacles occasionally, or rather looked through one of
the glasses, deciphered the characters in the book, and having committed
some of them to paper, handed copies from behind the curtain to those
who stood outside· Not a word was said about their being deciphered by
the gift of God. Everything in this way was effected by the large pair
of spectacle. The farmer added that he had been requested to contribute
a sum of money toward the publication of the golden book, the contents
of which would, as he was told, produce an entire change in the world,
and save it from ruin. So urgent had been these solicitations, that he
intended selling his farm and giving the amount to those who wished to
publish the plates. As a last precautionary step, he had resolved to
come to New York, and obtain the opinion of the learned about the
meaning of the paper which he brought with him, and which had been given
him as part of the contents of the book, although no translation had at
that time been made by the young man with spectacles. On hearing this
odd story, I changed my opinion about the paper, and instead of viewing
it any longer as a hoax, I began to regard it as part of a scheme to
cheat the farmer of his money, and I communicated my suspicions to him,
warning him to beware of rogues. He requested an opinion from me in
writing, which, of course, I declined to give, and he then took his
leave, taking his paper with him. This paper in question was, in fact. a
singular scroll. It consisted of all kinds of singular characters
disposed in columns, and had evidently been prepared by some person who
had before him at the time a book containing various alphabets, Greek
and Hebrew letters, crosses and flourishes; Roman letters inverted or
placed sideways were arranged and placed in perpendicular columns, and
the whole ended in a rude delineation of a circle, divided into <span
id="page_50">p. 50</span> various compartments, arched with various
strange marks, and evidently copied after the Mexican calendar given by
Humboldt, but copied in such a way as not to betray the source whence it
was derived. I am thus particular as to the contents of the paper,
inasmuch as I have frequently conversed with friends on the subject
since the Mormon excitement began, and well remember that the paper
contained anything else but Egyptian hieroglyphics. Some time after, the
farmer paid me a second visit. He brought with him the gold book in
print, and offered it to me for sale. I declined purchasing. He then
asked permission to leave the book with me for examination. I declined
receiving it, although his manner was strangely urgent. I adverted once
more to the roguery which, in my opinion, had been practised upon him,
and asked him what had become of the gold plates. He informed me they
were in a trunk with the spectacles. I advised him to go to a magistrate
and have the trunk examined. He said the curse of God would come upon
him if he did. On my pressing him, however, to go to a magistrate, he
told me he would open the trunk if I would take the curse of God upon
myself. I replied I would do so with the greatest willingness, and would
incur every risk of that nature, provided I could only extricate him
from the grasp of the rogues. He then left me. I have given you a full
statement of all that I know respecting the origin of Mormonism, and
must beg of you, as a personal favor, to publish this letter
immediately, should you find my name mentioned again by these wretched
fanatics.

Yours respectfully,

'CHARLES ANTHON.'

    It is but fair to state that Smith never claimed that the characters
were the ordinary Greek or Hebrew, but were what he called Reformed
Egyptian. Harris says: 'He gave me a certificate which I took and put
into my pocket, and was just leaving the house when Mr Anthon called me
back, and asked me how the young man found out that there were gold
plates in the place where he found them. I answered that an angel of God
had revealed it unto him. He then said unto me, Let me see that
certificate. I accordingly took it out of my pocket and gave it to him,
when he took it and tore it to pieces, saying that there was no such
thing now as ministering of angels, and that if I would bring the plates
to him he would translate them. I informed him that part of the plates
were sealed, and that I was forbidden to bring them; he replied, "I
cannot read a sealed book." I left him and went to Dr Mitchell, who
sanctioned what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters
and the translation.' Pearl of Great Price, xiii. 54.

name given to his book, is the English termination of the Greek word
*mormoo*, which we find defined in an old, obsolete dictionary to mean
bugbear, hobgoblin, raw head, and bloody bones.' *Howe's Mormonism
Unveiled*, 21. 'The word "Mormon" is neither Greek nor derived from the
Greek, but from the "reformed Egyptian."' *Bell's Reply to Theobald*, 2.
In *Times and Seasons*, Mr Smith writes as follows with regard to the
meaning of the word 'Mormon:' 'We say from the Saxon, *good*; the Dane,
*god*; the Goth, *goda*; the German, *gut*; the Dutch, *good*; the
Latin, *bonus*; the Greek, *kalos*; the Hebrew, *tob*; and the Egyptian,
*mon*. Hence, with the addition of *more*, or the contraction *mor*, we
have the word "Mormon," which means, literally *more good*.' 'Joseph
Smith, annoyed at the profane wit which could derive the word "Mormon"
from the Greek *mormo*, a bugbear, wrote an epistle on the subject,
concluding with an elaborate display of his philological talent such as
he was accustomed to make on every possible occasion.' *Taylder's
Mormon's Own Book*, xxxiv., xxxv.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[52:15](hou06.htm#fr_55.md) *The Book of Mormon; an
account written by The Hand of Mormon, upon plates taken from the plates
of Nephi. Wherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of
Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, who are a remnant of the house of
Israel; and also to Jew and Gentile; written by way of commandment, and
also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation. Written and sealed up,
and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed; to come
forth by the girl and power of God unto the interpretation thereof;
sealed by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in
due time by the way of Gentile; the interpretation thereof by the gift
of God. An abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also; which is a
record of the people of Jared; who were scattered at the time the Lord
confounded the language of the people when they were building a tower to
get to heaven; which is to show unto the remnant of the House of Israel
what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; and that they
may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not east off forever;
and also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the
Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations. And now
if there are faults, they are the mistakes of men; wherefore condemn not
the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of
Christ. By Joseph Smith, Jun., Author and Proprietor.* (Printed by E. B.
Grandin, for the author, Palmyra, New York, 1830.) Several editions
followed. This first edition has 588 pages, and is prefaced among other
things by an account of 117 pages, which Mrs Harris burned. This preface
is omitted in subsequent editions. The testimony of three witnesses, and
also of eight witnesses which in subsequent editions is placed at the
beginning, is here at the end. The testimony of witnesses affirms that
the signers saw the plates and the engravings thereon, having been shown
them by an angel from heaven; they knew of the translation, that it had
been done by the gift and power of God, and was therefore true. The book
was reprinted at Nauvoo, at New York, at Salt Lake City, and in Europe.
An edition printed by Jas O. Wright & Co., evidently by way of
speculation, contains eight pages of introduction, and an advertisement
asserting that it is a reprint from the third American edition, and that
the work was originally published at Nauvoo, which latter statement is
incorrect. The publishers further claim that at the time of this
printing, 1848, the book was out of print, notwithstanding the several
preceding <span id="page_54">p. 54</span> editions. The edition at
present in common use was printed at Salt Lake City, at the *Deseret
News* office, and entered according to act of congress in 1879, by
Joseph F. Smith. It is divided into chapters and verses, with references
by Orson Pratt, senior. The arrangement is as follows.

second book of Nephi, 33 chapters; the book of Jacob, the brother of
Nephi, 7 chapters; the book of Enos, 1 chapter; the book of Jarom, 1

the book of Mosiah, 29 chapters; the book of Alma, the son of Alma, 63

    From a manuscript furnished at my request by Franklin D. Richards,
entitled *The Book of Mormon,* I epitomize as follows: Several families
retaining similar forms of speech were directed by God to America, where
they became numerous and prosperous. They lived righteously at first,
but afterward became sinful, and about 600 B.C. broke up as a nation,
leaving records by their most eminent historian Ether. During the reign
of Zedekiah, king of Judah, two men, Lehi and Mulek, were warned of God
of the approaching destruction of Jerusalem, and were directed how they
and their families could make their escape, and were led to this land
where they found the records of the former people. Lehi landed at Chili.
His people spread to North America, became numerous and wealthy, lived
under the law of Moses which they had brought with them, and had their
judges, kings, prophets, and temples. Looking confidently for the coming
of Christ in the flesh, in due time he came, and afar his crucifixion
organized the church in America as he had done in Judea, an account of
which, together with their general history, was preserved on metallic
plates in the language of the times. An abridgment was made on gold
plates about A. D. 400 by a prophet named Mormon, from all the
historical plates that had come down to him. Thus were given not only
the histories of the Nephites and Lamanites—his own people—but of the
Jaredites, who had occupied the land before them, and his book was
called the Book of Mormon. Destruction coming upon the people, Mormon's
son, Moroni, was directed of God where to deposit the plates, the urim
and thummim being deposited with them so that the finder might be able
to read them. And as Moroni had left them so were they found by Joseph
Smith. The *Book of Mormon* was translated in 1851 into Italian, under
the auspices of Lorenzo Snow, and into Danish under the direction of
Erastus Snow; in 1852 John Taylor directed its translation into French
and German, and Franklin D. Richards into Welsh. In 1855 George Q.
Cannon brought out an edition in the Hawaiian language at San Francisco;
in 1878 N. C. Flygare supervised its publication in the Swedish, and
Moses Thatcher in 1884 in the Spanish language.

    In December 1874, Orson Pratt, at that time church historian,
prepared an article for insertion in the *Universal Cyclopedia,* a
portion of which is as follows: 'The first edition of this wonderful
book was published early in 1830. It has since been translated and
published in the Welsh, Danish, German, French, and Italian languages of
the east, and in the language of the Sandwich Islands of the west. It is
a volume about one third as large as the bible, consisting of sixteen
sacred books…One of the founders of the Jaredite nation, a great
prophet, saw in vision all things from the foundation of the world to
the end thereof, which were written, a copy of which was engraved by
Moroni on the plates of Mormon, and then sealed up. It was this portion
which the prophet, Joseph Smith, was forbidden to translate or to
unloose the seal. In due time this also will be revealed, together with
all the sacred records kept by the ancient nations of this continent,
preparatory to the time when the knowledge of God shall cover the earth
as the waters cover the great deep.' *Deseret News,* Sept. 27, 1876.
Orson Pratt afterward stated that the book of Mormon had been translated
into ten different languages. *Deseret News,* Oct. 9, 1878. See also
*Taylder's Mormons,* 10. For further criticisms on the book of Mormon,

<span id="fn_56"></span>[57:16](hou06.htm#fr_56.md) Oliver Cowdery 'is a
blacksmith by trade, and sustained a fair reputation until his intimacy
commenced with the money digger. He was one of the many in the world who
always find time to study out ways and means to live without work. He
accordingly quit the blacksmithing business, and is now the editor of a
small monthly publication issued under the directions of the prophet,
and principally filled with accounts of the spread of Mormonism, their
persecutions, and the fabled visions and commands of Smith.' He was
'chief scribe to the prophet, while transcribing, after Martin had lost
116 pages of the precious document by interference of the devil. An
angel also has shown him the plates from which the book of Mormon
proceeded, as he says.' *Howe's Mormonism Unveiled*, 15, 265; see also
*Pearl of Great Price*, xiii. 54; *Smucker's Hist. Mor*., 28; *Taylder's
Mormons*, xxxii.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[57:17](hou06.htm#fr_57.md) 'Instead of looking at
the characters inscribed upon the plates, the prophet was obliged to
resort to the old peep-stone which he formerly used in money digging.
This he placed in a hat, or box, into which he also thrust his
face…Another account they give of the transaction is, that it was
performed with the big spectacles,' which enabled 'Smith to translate
the plates without looking at them.' *Howe's Mormonism Unveiled*, 17-18.
'These were days never to be forgotten,' Oliver remarks, 'to sit under
the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven, awakened the
utmost gratitude of this bosom! Day after day I continued,
uninterrupted, to write from his mouth, as he translated with the urim
and thummim, or, as the Nephites would have said, "interpreters," the
history or record called the "Book of Mormon,"' *Pearl of Great Price*,
55. See also *Mackay's The Mormons*, 30-31; *Millennial Star*, iii. 148;
*Smucker's Hist. Mormons*, 35; *Pratt's Pamphlets*, iv. 58-9; *Ferris’
Utah and the Mormons*, 61-2. In relation to the peep-stone alluded to,
Williard Chase says in his sworn testimony that he discovered a singular
stone while digging a well in the year 1822. Joseph Smith was assisting
him, and borrowed the stone from him, alleging that he could see into
it. After he obtained the stone Smith published abroad the wonders that
he could see in the stone, and made much disturbance among the credulous
members of the community. See *Howe's Mormonism Unveiled*, 241. 'This
stone attracted particular notice on account of its peculiar shape,
resembling that of a child's foot. It was of a whitish, glassy
appearance, though opaque, resembling quartz…He (Joseph Jr) manifested a
special fancy for this geological curiosity; and he carried it home with
him, though this act of plunder was against the strenuous protestations
of Mr Chase's children, who claimed to be its rightful owners. Joseph
kept this stone, and ever afterward refused its restoration to the
claimants Very soon the pretension transpired that he could see
wonderful things by its aid. The idea was rapidly enlarged upon from day
to day and in a short time his spiritual endowment was so developed that
he asserted the gift and power (with the stone at his eyes) of revealing
both things existing and things to come.' *Tucker's Mormonism*, 19-20.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[59:18](hou06.htm#fr_58.md) The objections raised
against this testimony are, first, there is no date nor place; second,
there are not three separate affidavits, but one testimony signed by
three men; third, compare with Smith's revelation *Doctrine and
Covenants*, p. 173, and it appears that this testimony is drawn up by
Smith himself. But who are these witnesses? Sidney Rigdon, at
Independence, Missouri, in 1838, charged Cowdery and Whitmer with 'being
connected with a gang of counterfeiters, thieves, liars, blacklegs of
the deepest dye, to deceive and defraud the saints.' Joseph Smith
(*Times and Seasons*, vol. i. pp. 81, 83-4) charges Cowdery and Whitmer
with being busy in stirring up strife and turmoil among the brethren in
1838 in Missouri; and he demands, 'Are they not murderers then at the
heart? Are not their consciences seared as with a hot iron?' These men
were consequently cut off from the church. In 1837 Smith prints this
language about his coadjutor and witness: 'There are negroes who have
white skins as well as black ones—Granny Parish and others, who acted as
lackeys, such as Martin Harris! But they are so far beneath my contempt
that to notice any of them would be too great a sacrifice for a
gentleman to make.' *Hyde's Mormonism*, 252-5. Of David Whitmer, Mr Howe
says: 'He is one of five of the same name and family who have been used
as witnesses to establish the imposition, and who are now head men and
leaders in the Mormonite camp. They were noted in their neighborhood for
credulity and a general belief in witches, and perhaps were fit subjects
for the juggling arts of Smith. David relates that he was led by Smith
into an open field, on his father's farm, where they found the book of
plates lying upon the ground. Smith took it up and requested him to
examine it, which he did for the space of half an hour or more, when he
returned it to Smith, who placed it in its former position, alleging
that it was in the custody of an angel. He describes the plates as being
about eight inches square, the leaves being metal of a whitish yellow
color, and of the thickness of tin plates.' *Mormonism Unveiled*, 16.

69-71; *Smucker's Hist. Mor*., 29-30; *Bertrand's Mémoires d'un Mormon*,
29-31.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[59:19](hou06.htm#fr_59.md) 'It will be seen that
the witnesses of this truth were principally of the two families of
Whitmer and Smith. The Smiths were the father and brothers of Joseph.
Who the Whitmers were is not clear, and all clew to their character and
proceedings since this date, though probably known to the Mormons
themselves, is undiscoverable by the profane vulgar.' *Mackay's The
Mormons*, 23.

    The theory commonly accepted at present by those not of the Mormon
faith, in regard to the origin of the book of Mormon, is thus given in
the introduction <span id="page_60">p. 60</span> to the New York edition
of the *Book of Mormon,* essentially the same as that advanced
previously by E. D. Howe, and subsequently elaborated by others: 'About
the year 1809, the Rev. Solomon Spaulding, a clergy-man who had
graduated from Dartmouth college, and settled in the town of Cherry
Valley, in the State of New York, removed from that place to New Salem
(Conneaut). Ashtubula county, Ohio. Mr Spaulding was an enthusiastic
archaeologist. The region to which he removed was rich in American
antiquities. The mounds and fortifications which have puzzled the brains
of many patient explorers attracted his attention, and he accepted the
theory that the American continent was peopled by a colony of the
ancient Israelites. The ample material by which he was surrounded, full
of mythical interest and legendary suggestiveness, led him to the
conception of a curious literary project. He set himself the task of
writing a fictitious history of the race which had built the mounds. The
work was commenced and progressed slowly for some time. Portions of it
were read by Mr Spaulding's friends, as its different sections were
completed, and after three years’ labor, the volume was sent to the
press, bearing the title of *The Manuscript Found.* Mr Spaulding had
removed to Pittsburgh, Pa., before his book received the final revision,
and it was in the hands of a printer named Patterson, in that city, that
the manuscript was placed with a view to publication. This was in the
year 1812. The printing, however, was delayed in consequence of a
difficulty about the contract, until Mr Spaulding left Pittsburgh, and
went to Amity, Washington county, New York, where in 1816 he died. The
manuscript seems to have lain unused during this interval. But in the
employ of the printer Patterson was a versatile genius, one Sidney
Rigdon, to whom no trade came amiss, and who happened at the time to be
a journeyman at work with Patterson. Disputations on questions of
theology were the peculiar delight of Rigdon, and the probable solution
of the mystery of the book of Mormon is found in the fact that, by this
man's agency, information of the existence of the fictitious record was
first communicated to Joseph Smith. Smith's family settled in Palmyra,
New York, about the year 1815, and removed subsequently to Ontario
county, where Joseph became noted for supreme cunning and general
shiftlessness. Chance threw him in the company of Rigdon soon after
Spaulding's manuscript fell under the eye of the erratic journeyman, and
it is probable that the plan of founding a new system of religious
imposture was concocted by these two shrewd and unscrupulous parties.
The fact that the style of the book of Mormon so closely imitates that
of the received version of the bible—a point which seems to have been
constantly kept in view by Mr Spaulding, probably in order to invest the
fiction with a stronger character of reality—answered admirably for the
purposes of Rigdon and Smith.' Mr Howe testifies that 'an opinion has
prevailed to a considerable extent that Rigdon has been the Iago, the
prime mover of the whole conspiracy. Of this, however, we have no
positive proof.' *Mormonism Unveiled,* 100.

    To prove the foregoing, witnesses are brought forward. John
Spaulding, brother of Solomon, testifies: 'He then told me that he had
been writing a book, which he intended to have printed, the avails of
which he thought would enable him to pay all his debts. The book was
entitled *The Manuscript Found,* of which he read to me many passages.
It was an historical romance of the first settlers of America,' etc. He
goes on to speak of Nephi and Lehi as names familiar, as does also
Martha Spaulding, John's wife. Henry Lake, formerly Solomen's partner,
testifies to the same effect; also John N. Miller, who worked for Lake
and Spaulding in building their forge; also Aaron Wright, Oliver Smith,
and Nahum Howard, neighbors; also Artemas Cunningham, to whom Spaulding
owed money. To these men Solomon Spaulding used to talk about and read
from his *Manuscript Found,* which was an account of the ten lost tribes
in America, which he wanted to publish and with the profits pay his
debts. After the book of Mormon was printed, and they saw it, or heard
it read, they were sure it was the same as Spaulding's *Manuscript
Found. Id.,* 278-87. <span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

*    Who Wrote the Book of Mormon?* is the title of a 4to pamphlet of 16
pages by Robert Patterson of Pittsburgh. Reprinted from the illustrated
history of Washington county, Philadelphia, 1882. This Patterson is the
son of printer Patterson, to whose office the Spaulding MS. is said to
have been sent. Little new information is brought out by this
inquisition. First he extracts passages from Howe's *Mormonism
Unveiled,* quoting at secondhand from Kidder's *Mormonism and the
Mormons, in* the absence of the original, stating erroneously that
Howe's book was first printed in 1835. I give elsewhere an epitome of
the contents of Howe's work. Ballantyne in his *Reply to a Tract,* by T.
Richards, *What is Mormonism?* wherein is advanced the Spaulding theory,
asserts in answer that Spaulding's manuscript was not known to Smith or
Rigdon until after the publication of the *Book of Mormon,* and that the
two were not the same, the latter being about three times larger than
the former. 'Dr Hurlburt,' he says, 'and certain other noted enemies of
this cause, having heard that such a manuscript existed, determined to
publish it to the world in order to destroy the book of Mormon, but
after examining it, found that it did not read as they expected,
consequently declined its publication.' The Spaulding theory is advanced
and supported by the following, in addition to the eight witnesses whose
testimony was given by Howe in his *Mormonism Unveiled.* Mrs Matilda
Spaulding Davidson, once wife of Solomon Spaulding, said to Rev. D. R.
Austin, who had the statement printed in the *Boston Recorder,* May
1839, that Spaulding was in the habit of reading portions of his romance
to his friends and neighbors. When John Spaulding heard read for the
first time passages from the book of Mormon he 'recognized perfectly the
work of his brother. He was amazed and afflicted that it should have
been perverted to *so* wicked a purpose. His grief found vent in a flood
of tears, and he arose on the spot and expressed to the meeting his
sorrow and regret that the writings of his deceased brother should be
uses for a purpose so vile and shocking.' Statements to the same effect
are given as coming from Mrs McKinstry, daughter of Spaulding, printed
in *Scribner's Monthly,* August 1880; W. H. Sabine, brother of Mrs
Spaulding; Joseph Miller, whose statements were printed in the
*Pittsburgh Telegraph,* Feb. 6, 1879; Redick McKee in the *Washington
Reporter,* April 21, 1869; Rev. Abner Jackson in a communication to the
Washington County Historical Society, printed in the *Washington
Reporter,* Jan. 7, 1881, and others. See also *Kidder's Mormonism,*
37-49; *California—Its Past History,* 198-9; *Ferris’ Utah and Mormons,*
50-1; *Gunnison's Mormons,* 93-7; *Bertrand's Mémoires d'un Mormon,*
33-44; *Hist. of Mormons,* 41-50; *Bennett's Mormonism*, 115-24; *Howe's
Mormonism,* 289-90.

    Robert Patterson, in his pamphlet entitled *Who Wrote the Book of
Mormon?* thus discusses the case of Sidney Rigdon: 'It was
satisfactorily proven that Spaulding was the author of the book of
Mormon; but how did Joseph Smith obtain a copy of it? The theory
hitherto most widely published,' says Patterson, 'and perhaps' generally
accepted, has been that Rigdon was a printer in Patterson's
printing-office when the Spaulding manuscript was brought there in
1812-14, and that he either copied or purloined it. Having it thus in
his possession, the use made of it was an after thought suggested by
circumstances many years later. More recently another theory has been
advanced, that Rigdon obtained possession of the Spaulding manuscript
during his pastorate of the first baptist church or soon thereafter,
1822-4, without any necessary impropriety on his part, but rather
through the courtesy of some friend, in whose possession it remained
unclaimed, and who regarded it as a literary curiosity. The friends of
Rigdon, in response to the first charge, deny that he ever resided in
Pittsburgh previous to 1822, or that he ever was a printer, and in
general answer to both charges affirm that he never at any time had
access to Spaulding's manuscript.' Rigdon denies emphatically that he
ever worked in Patterson's printing-office or knew of such an
establishment; and the testimony, produced by Patterson of Carvil
Rigdon, Sidney's brother, Peter Boyer, his brother-in-law, Isaac King,
Samuel Cooper, Robert Dubois, and Mrs Lambdin points in the same
direction. On <span id="page_62">p. 62</span> the other hand, Mrs
Davidson, Joseph Miller, Redick McKee, Rev. Cephas Dodd, and Mrs
Eichbaum are quite positive that either Rigdon worked in the printing
office, or had access to the manuscript. 'These witnesses,' continues
Patterson, 'are all whom we can find, after inquiries extending through
some three years, who can testify at all to Rigdon's residence in
Pittsburgh before 1816, and to his possible employment in Patterson's
printing-office or bindery. Of this employment none of them speak from
personal knowledge. In making inquiries among two or three score of the
oldest residents of Pittsburgh and vicinity, those who had any opinion
on the subject invariably, so far as now remembered, repeated the story
of Rigdon's employment in Patterson's office as if it were a well known
and admitted fact; they could tell all about it, but when pressed as to
their personal knowledge of it or their authority for the conviction,
they had none.' Nevertheless he concludes, 'after an impartial
consideration of the preceding testimony, that Rigdon as early as 1823
certainly had possession of Spaulding's manuscript; how he obtained it
is unimportant for the present purpose; that during his career as a
minister of the Disciples church in Ohio, he carefully preserved under
lock and key this document, and devoted an absorbed attention to it;
that he was aware of the forthcoming book of Mormon and of its contents
long before its appearance; that the said contents were largely
Spaulding's romance, and partly such modifications as Rigdon had
introduced; and that, during the preparation of the book of Mormon,
Rigdon had repeated and long interviews with Smith, thus easily
supplying him with fresh instalments of the pretended revelation.' In a
letter to the editors of the *Boston Journal,* dated May 27, 1839,
Rigdon says: 'There was no man by the name of Patterson during my
residence at Pittsburgh who had a printing-office; what might have been
before I lived there I know not. Mr Robert Patterson, I was told, had
owned a printing-office before I lived in that city, but had been
unfortunate in business, and failed before my residence there. This Mr
Patterson, who was a presbyterian preacher, I had a very slight
acquaintance with during my residence in Pittsburgh. He was then acting
under an agency in the book and stationery business, and was the owner
of no property of any kind, printing-office or anything else, during the
time I resided in the city.' *Smucker's Mormons,* 45-8.

    In Philadelphia, in 1840, was published *The Origin of the Spaulding
Story, concerning the Manuscript Found; with a short biography of Dr P.
Hulbert, the originator of the same; and some testimony adduced, showing
it to be a sheer fabrication so far as its connection with the Book of
Mormon is concerned. By B. Winchester, minister of the Gospel.* The
author goes on to say that Hulbert, a methodist preacher at Jamestown,
N. Y., joined the Mormons in 1833, and was expelled for immoral conduct,
whereupon he swore vengeance and concocted the Spaulding story. Hearing
of a work written by Solomon Spaulding entitled *The Manuscript Found,*
he sought to prove to those about him that the book of Mormon was
derived from it, 'not that any of these persona had the most distant
idea that this novel had ever been converted into the book of Mormon, or
that there was any connection between them. Indeed Mr Jackson, who had
read both the book of Mormon and Spaulding's manuscript, told Mr H. when
he came to get his signature to a writing testifying to the probability
that Mr S.'s manuscript had been converted into the book of Mormon, that
there was no agreement between them; for, said he, Mr S.'s manuscript
was a very small work, in the form of a novel, saying not one word about
the children of Israel, but professed to give an account of a race of
people who originated from the Romans, which Mr S. said he had
translated from a Latin parchment that he had found.' Winchester states
further that Hurlburt, or Hulbert, wrote *Mormonism Unveiled* and sold
it to Howe for $500.

*    The Myth of the Manuscript Found; or the absurdities of the
Spaulding story; By Elder George Reynolds,* was published at Salt Lake
City in 1883. It is a 12mo vol. of 104 pages, and gives first the
history of the Spaulding manuscript and names Hurlburt as the originator
of the story. Chap. iii. is entitled 'the bogus affidavit,' referring to
the alleged sworn statement of Mrs <span id="page_63">p. 63</span>
Davison, the widow of Spaulding, published by Storrs, but denied by Mrs
Davison. Rigdon's connection, or rather lack of connection with the
manuscript is next discussed. Then is answered an article in *Scribner's
Magazine* by Mrs Dickenson, grand niece of Mr Spaulding, and probably
the most shallow treatment of the subject yet presented on either side.
Further discussions on the book are followed by an analysis of the life
of Joseph, and finally internal evidences and prophecies are considered.
'It is evident,' Mr Reynolds concludes, 'that if Mr Spaulding's story
was what its friends claim, then it never could have formed the
ground-work of the book of Mormon; for the whole historical narrative is
different from beginning to end. And further, the story that certain old
inhabitants of New Salem, who, it is said, recognized the book of
Mormon, either never made such a statement, or they let their
imagination run away with their memory into the endorsement of a
falsehood and an impossibility.'

<span id="fn_60"></span>[63:20](hou06.htm#fr_60.md) Speaking of Martin
Harris, E. D. Howe says: 'Before his acquaintance with the Smith family
he was considered an honest, industrious citizen by his neighbors. His
residence was in the town of Palmyra, where he had accumulated a
handsome property. He was naturally of a very visionary turn of mind on
the subject of religion, holding one sentiment but a short time.'
Mortgaged his farm for $3,000, and printed the *Book of Mormon*, as he
said, to make money. The price first was $1.75, then $1.25, afterward
whatever they could get. 'Since that time the frequent demands on
Martin's purse have reduced it to a very low state. He seems to have
been the soul and body of the whole imposition, and now carries the most
incontestable proofs of a religious maniac…Martin is an exceedingly fast
talker. He frequently gathers a crowd around in bar-rooms and in the
streets. Here he appears to be in his element, answering and explaining
all manner of dark and abstruse theological questions…He is the source
of much trouble and perplexity to the honest portion of his brethren,
and would undoubtedly long since have been cast off by Smith were it not
for his money, and the fact that he is one of the main pillars of the
Mormon fabric.' *Mormonism Unveiled*, 13-15. 'The wife of Martin Harris
instituted a lawsuit against him \[Joseph Smith, Jr\], and stated in her
affidavit that she believed the chief object he had in view was to
defraud her husband of all his property. the trial took place at New
York, and the facts, as related even by the mother of the prophet, are
strongly condemnatory of his conduct…Harris denied in solemn terms that
Smith had ever, in any manner, attempted to get possession of his money,
and ended by assuring the gentlemen of the court that, if they did not
believe in the existence of the plates, and continued to resist the
truth, it would one day be the means of damning their souls.' *Taylder's
Mormons*, xxxi.-ii. 'In the beginning of the printing the Mormons
professed to hold their manuscripts as sacred, and insisted upon
maintaining, constant vigilance for their safety during the progress of
the work, each morning carrying to the printing-office the instalment
required for the day, and withdrawing the same at evening. No alteration
from copy in any manner was to be made. These things were "strictly
commanded," as they said. Mr <span id="page_64">p. 64</span> John H.
Gilbert, as printer, had the chief operative trust of the type-setting
and press-work of the job. After the first day's trial he found the
manuscripts in so very imperfect a condition, especially in regard to
grammar. that he became unwilling further to obey the "command," and so
announced to Smith and his party; when finally, upon much friendly
expostulation, he was given a limited discretion in correcting, which
was exercised in the particulars of syntax, orthography, punctuation,
capitalizing, paragraphing, etc. Many errors under these heads,
nevertheless, escaped correction, as appear in the first edition of the
printed book. Very soon, too—after some ten days—the constant vigilance
by the Mormons over the manuscripts was relaxed by reason of the
confidence they came to repose in the printers. Mr Gilbert has now
(1867) in his possession a complete copy of the book in the original
sheets, as laid off by him from the press in working…Meanwhile, Harris
and his wife had separated by mutual arrangement, on account of her
persistent unbelief in Mormonism and refusal to be a party to the
mortgage. The family estate was divided, Harris giving her about eighty
acres of the farm, with a comfortable house and other property, as her
share of the assets; and she occupied this property until the time of
her death.' *Tucker's Origin and Prog. Mor*., 50-7.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[64:21](hou06.htm#fr_61.md) Speaking of the manner
in which Smith delivered these revelations, Howe says: 'In this
operation he abandoned his spectacles, or peep-stone, and merely
delivered it with his eyes shut. In this manner he governs his
followers, by asking the Lord, as he says, from day to day.' *Mormonism
Unveiled*, 102.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[66:22](hou06.htm#fr_62.md) The church was not at
that time so called, nor indeed until after the 4th of May, 1834. See
chap. iv., note 50; also *Millennial Star*, iv. 115; *Burton's City of
the Saints*, 671-2. Kidder, *Mormonism*, 68, affirms that this name was
not adopted till some years later. Mather is only a year and a day
astray when he says, 'The conference of elders on May 3, 1833,
repudiated the name of "Mormons" and adopted that of "Latter-Day
Saints."' *Lippincott's Mag*., Aug. 1880. The term 'Mormons,' as first
applied by their enemies to members of the church of Latter-Day Saints,
was quite offensive to them, though later they became somewhat more
reconciled to it. As at present popularly employed, it is by no means a
term of reproach, though among themselves they still adhere to the
appellation 'Saints,' just as quakers speak of themselves as the
'Society of Friends.' The term 'Mormon' seems to me quite fitting for
general use, fully as much so as presbyterian, reformed Dutch,
universalist, and others, few of which were of their own choosing.
'Mormon was the name of a certain man, and also of a particular locality
upon the American continent; but was never intended to signify a body of
people. The name by which we desire to be known and to walk worthy of is
Saints. *Bell's Reply to Theobald*, 2. At the time of the riots in
Missouri, in addressing communications to the governor, and in many
other instances, they designate themselves as members of the church of
Christ, vulgarly called Mormons.' See also *De Smet's Western Missions*,
393; *Mackay's The Mormons*, 41-2. The term 'gentile' was generally
applied to unbelievers of the white race. The Indians, originally, were
denominated 'of the house of Israel,' 'of the house of Joseph,' or 'of
the house of Jacob,' also the Lamanites.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[69:23](hou06.htm#fr_63.md) 'The Lamanites
originally were a remnant of Joseph, and in the first year of the reign
of Zedekiah, King of Judah, were led in a miraculous manner from
Jerusalem to the eastern borders of the Red Sea, thence for some time
along its borders in a nearly south-east direction, after which they
altered their course nearly eastward, until they came to the great
waters, where by the command of God they built a vessel in which they
were safely brought across the great Pacific Ocean, and landed upon the
western coast of South America. The original party included also the
Nephites, their leader being a prophet called Nephi; but soon after
landing they separated, because the Lamanites, whose leader was a wicked
man called Laman, persecuted the others. After the partition the
Nephites, who had brought with them the old testament down to the time
of Jeremiah, engraved on plates of brass, in the Egyptain language,
prospered and built large cities. But the bold, bad Lamanites,
originally white, became dark and dirty, though still retaining a
national existence. They became wild, savage, and ferocious, seeking by
every means the destruction of the prosperous Nephites, against whom
they many times arrayed their hosts in battle; but were repulsed and
driven back to their own territories, generally with great loss to both
sides. The slain, frequently amounting to tens of thousands, were piled
together in great heaps and overspread with a thin covering of earth,
which will satisfactorily account for those ancient mounds filled with
human bones, so numerous at the present day, both in North and South
America.' *Pratt (Orson), Series of Pamphlets*, vi. 7-8; *Pratt (P. P.),
Voice of Warning*, 81-117.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[69:24](hou06.htm#fr_64.md) 'The attention of the
little band was directed, from the very commencement of their
organization, to the policy and expediency of fixing their headquarters
in the far west, in the thinly settled and but partially explored
territories belonging to the United States, where they might squat upon
or purchase good lands at a cheap rate, and clear the primeval
wilderness. <span id="page_70">p. 70</span> They required elbow-room,
and rightly judged that a rural population would be more favorable than
an urban one to the reception of their doctrine.' *Mackay's The Mor*.,
63.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[70:25](hou06.htm#fr_65.md) The most ancient
prophecy which the saints are now in possession of relating to the New
Jerusalem was one delivered by Enoch, the seventh from Adam. This was
revealed anew to Joseph Smith in December 1830. In it the Lord is
represented as purposing 'to gather out mine own elect from the four
quarters of the earth unto a place which I shall prepare…But this
revelation does not tell in what part of the earth the New Jerusalem
should be located. The book of Mormon, which the Lord has brought out of
the earth, informs us that this holy city is to be built upon the
continent of America, but it does not inform us upon what part of that
vast country it should be built.' *Pratt's Series of Pamphlets*, vii. 4;
*Pratt's Interesting Account*, 16-25; *First Book of Nephi* in *Book of
Mormon*.
