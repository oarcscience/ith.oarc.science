This is a historical document which defends the authenticity of the
controversial Book of Abraham, part of the canonical [Pearl of Great
Price](../pgp/index.htm#boa.md). The Book of Abraham was purportedly
translated from an Egyptian manuscript purchased by the Mormons from a
travelling show in 1835, long before their trek to Utah. Joseph Smith
quickly produced a translation of this document, claiming it was written
by Abraham in his own hand. Since modern knowledge of the Egyptian
writing system was in its infancy at this time, there was no way to
verify this claim.

The manuscript disappeared for many years until it resurfaced in 1967 in
the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. At that time Egyptian
experts verified that it was actually a papyrus of a portion of the
[Book of the Dead](../../egy/ebod/index.md).

Notwithstanding, the Book of Abraham is still considered part of the
Pearl of Great Price and is held to be authentic by devout Mormons. This
does not invalidate Mormon doctrine; any sacred text which has have
signficance for the faithful should be considered valid on its own
terms.

Keep in mind that this is actually a very typical story of the origin of
many sacred texts, including all of the best known ones; the difference
is simply that it played itself out recently instead of in the misty
past. --J.B. Hare.
