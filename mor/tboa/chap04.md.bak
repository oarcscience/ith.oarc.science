ABRAHAM IN EGYPT.--CONFIRMATORY STATEMENTS OR JOSEPHUS, NICOLAUS OF
DAMASCUS, AND OTHERS.--ABRAHAM'S INFLUENCE ON THE RELIGIONS OF EGYPT,
PERSIA AND HINDOOSTAN.--TRACES OF GOSPEL TEACHING IN THE MYTHOLOGIES OF
EGYPT, PERSIA, CHALDEA, GREECE AND ROME.--FIRST DEPARTURES FROM THE TRUE
FAITH.--THE EGYPTIAN WORSHIP OF ADAM AND THE PATRIARCHS.--THE BOOK OF
THE DEAD.

THE Book of Abraham states that God commanded the patriarch to show unto
the Egyptians the things that He had revealed unto him. Josephus, in
narrating this portion of Abraham's history--being only partially
acquainted with the facts of the case from the authorities at his
disposal--tell us that Abraham went down into Egypt to avoid the famine
in Canaan, and to "become an auditor of their priests, and to know what
they said concerning the gods; designing either to follow them if they
had better notions than he, or to convert them into a better way if his
own notions proved the truest."\[<a href="#foot1" id="text1">1</a>\]
After his arrival in Egypt, and the circumstances arising out of the
attempt of Pharaoh to add Sarah to the number of his wives, the outcome
of which placed the monarch under obligations to the patriarch, Josephus
states that "Pharaoh gave Abraham leave to enter into conversation with
the most learned among the Egyptians, from which conversation his virtue
and his reputation became more conspicuous than they had been before.
For whereas the Egyptians were formerly addicted to different customs,
and despised one another's sacred and accustomed rites, and were very
angry one with another on that account, Abraham conferred with each of
them, and, confuting the reasonings they made use of, every one for his
own practices, he demonstrated that such reasonings were vain and void
of truth; whereupon he was admired by them in those conferences as a
very wise man, and one of great sagacity, when he discoursed upon any
subject he undertook; and this not only in understanding it, but in
persuading other men also to assent to
him."\[<a href="#foot2" id="text2">2</a>\] In another place the Jewish
historian states, "He (Abraham) was a person of great sagacity, both for
understanding all things, and persuading his hearers, and not mistaken
in his opinions; for which reason he began to have higher notions of
virtue than others had, and he determined to renew and to change the
opinion all men happened then to have concerning
God."\[<a href="#foot3" id="text3">3</a>\]

So far as Josephus' testimony, confirmatory of this portion of the Book
of Abraham, is concerned, we deem the above abundant. In later chapters
we shall show the great political and religious changes that Abraham's
visits to Egypt produced.

From Egypt we will turn to Persia, and from the writings of various
modern authors adduce testimony to prove that Abraham's power as a
religious teacher was felt, known and recognized in the faith and creed
of that nation.

In the sacred book of the ancient Persians and modern Parsees-- the Zend
Avista--"it is declared that the religion taught in it was received from
Abraham; and according to Hyde, who supports his statements by
quotations and references, this was believed by leading Arabian writers
not only of Persian Magianism but of Indian Brahmanism." The same writer
remarks: "The claims of Magianism to have been influenced by the
revelations made to Abraham are far from being discountenanced by the
laws of historical probability. For the war waged so successfully by
Abraham in behalf of his kinsman, Lot, against the five kings, among
whom was the king of Elam \[*i.e.,* Persia\], is of itself a sufficient
proof that the Father of the Faithful, Abraham, the Hebrew from Ur of
the Chaldees, must have been as well known to the eastern kingdoms as
Moses was in after times."\[<a href="#foot4" id="text4">4</a>\]

It is generally admitted that in the days of Abraham the forefathers of
the Persians and Brahmins were one people, inhabiting one region of
country. It is supposed that the ancestors of the latter race moved to
India from 1500 to 1300 years B. C. That these two races are of common
descent is urged from the close relationship existing between the
Sanskrit, the language of the Brahmins, and the Zend or Persian; it is
also said that the "remarkable identity between the Brahminical and
Persian mythologies indicates, unerringly, the original union of the
two." It may also be noticed that Hitzig, in his "Geschichte dcs Volkes
Israel," reasons from the identity of certain practices observed by
Abraham and the patriarchs of Israel on the one hand, and by Brahminical
Hindoos on the other, that a community of some kind once existed between
these people.

The two nations being thus admitted, by authors of research, to have
been one people in Abraham's time, it is supposable that the Brahmin as
well as the Persian branch of the family would exhibit some traces of
Abraham's ministry. On this point it has been written "Abraham's
influence extended to Bactria, and the most complete proof at once of
its spread, and the spread with it of the name and renown of Abraham, is
contained in the language and name of the Brahminical
Hindoos."\[<a href="#foot5" id="text5">5</a>\]

"The name Brahma signifies he who multiplies; the name Abraham likewise
means the father of a multitude. (Arabic, Rahama, a multitude. Genesis
xxii, 5.) The wife of Brahma was named Savitree. The wife of Abraham was
named Sarai or Sarah." \[<a href="#foot6" id="text6">6</a>\]

Mr. Goodsir, remarking on this last extract, writes: "These coincidences
appear to us to be well deserving of attention, though we are not aware
that they have ever before been noticed. We leave them and the whole
question of the identity of Brahma and Abraham to the judgment of our
readers, merely observing, in conclusion, that having found Adam and
Noah and Ham to have been the father-gods of Egyptian mythology, and
Japhet the father-god of that of Greece, there is abundant analogy as
well as probability in our inference that the father-god of the Indian
superstition was Abraham."

Admitting the truth of the following extract from the writings of
Nicolaus of Damascus, referred to by Josephus, it is very easy to
understand when and how Abraham obtained his great influence in Persia;
and we know of no conflicting testimony to render the statements
unworthy of our consideration. He writes, in the fourth book of his
history: "Abram reigned in Damascus, being a foreigner, who came with an
army out of the land above Babylon, called the land of the Chaldees; but
after a long time he got him up and removed from that country also, with
his people, and went into the land then called the land of Canaan, but
now the land of Judea. \* \* \* Now the name of Abram is even still
famous in the country of Damascus, and there is shewed a village named
from him, the habitation of Abraham."

We now come to the consideration of the traces, ofttimes scarcely
discernable, found in the pagan religions of the ancient nations of the
eastern continent, of a time when the worship of the true God was taught
and understood in their midst, for we fully believe that having made of
one blood all the nations of the earth, "God guided and ruled over pagan
nations in a manner the same in kind, though much modified in degree, as
in the case of the chosen people; and for the same great final end." Let
it not be supposed, in the following pages, that we desire to extenuate
the sinfulness, or to palliate the foulness of idolatrous, cruel,
unclean and licentious paganism in any of its branches. Our desire is to
exalt the goodness of God, as well as to show that under all the
vileness, the indecency, the lust and cruelty of many of the forms of
ancient paganism, could be found a sub-stratum of pure revealed truth,
testifying to us that at some period the fathers of these peoples held
intercourse with the servants of the true God, but had fallen away from
the principles of righteousness aforetime taught them, and after their
own peculiar ways and to suit their own peculiar notions and desires,
had heaped to themselves gods and demons, creeds and rites, ceremonies
and mysteries, oracles and auguries, differing in different nations
according to the force of circumstances and the direction given to them
by master minds.

As a proof of the truth of our position, we have but to refer to the
fact that it has been demonstrated that the further we go back through
the centuries to the primeval days succeeding the dispersion of mankind
at the Tower of Babel, the more frequent and more noticeable are the
traces of pure religious truth found intermingled with the follies and
vagueries of man-made religions. As an example of this, it is recounted
by Levy, the Roman historian, that certain sacred books having been
found at the burying place of Numa, the great religious legislator of
early Rome, they were burned because they were not suited to the times
in which they were discovered, when Rome had added scores of gods to its
Pantheon, though they were considered suited to the early era in which
they were written, when Numa forbade images and their worship as well as
the offering of human sacrifices.

It is not difficult for those who believe in the Bible as it is written,
to understand that immediately after the flood there was but one form of
faith upon the earth, and that the true one. Noah was a preacher of
righteousness both before and after the deluge, and because of their
obedience to God's laws, he and his family were saved from the universal
destruction that came upon the wicked. But their descendants, in an
early day, began to depart from the purity of the truths that had saved
"the fathers," and a knowledge of the forms of iniquity that existed
amongst the antediluvians was in some manner conveyed to them, and
incorporated in their debased new systems of worship. Noah, Melchizedek
and others battled with but partial success against these growing
infamies, and Abraham was especially called of the Lord to usher in a
new dispensation. We have seen, in part, how he fulfilled this call; we
shall now refer to some Gospel ideas that for many centuries afterwards
were found incorporated amongst the filth and rubbish of paganism, some
in Egypt, some in Persia, some in Chaldea, some in Greece, Rome and
other nations. From this almost universal admixture of the true and the
false it is evident that there was some primeval source from which the
ancient gentile nations drew that which was good and true in their
religions.

In our researches into the mythology of these peoples we find, amongst
others, the following Gospel ideas:

The belief in the existence of one great father God.

The prophecy and expectation of the coming of a Son of God in the flesh.

A reverence for Adam as the great prince of his race, in some nations,
extended to his worship as the father of the terrestrial gods.

The belief in a resurrection, and in future rewards and punishments.

The necessity of faith in the gods, and under certain very remarkable
circumstances, to be hereafter noticed, of repentance and baptism.

The administration of washings and anointings.

Traditions, more or less perfect, of the great war in heaven when
Lucifer and his angels were cast down upon the earth.

The belief in good and bad angels, ministers of the will of heaven.

A belief in the eternity of matter, and

The almost universal practice of sacrifice.

To give strength to the above assertions we shall now appeal to a number
of well-known authors.

The Rev. Mr. Goodsir, in his work on Ethnic Inspiration, writes: "The
principles of mythology enable us to discern the true order in which the
various erroneous and morbid developments of human belief arose. It
proves both that monotheism--the knowledge of the true God, preceded the
various forms of polytheism, and especially the worship of the heavenly
bodies; and that the worship of dead men preceded other forms of false
or idolatrous worship; and the same facts which show that the worship of
dead men was the first step in false religion, prove at the same time
the original grafting of this on the belief of a heavenly Creator and
Father. Were there no other than the single case of Egypt, as explained
from its language, hieroglyphics and monuments, by Mr. Os-born, it would
place the matter beyond all doubt, so clear and well-supported is that
case. Adam and Eve, Noah and Tamer, Ham,
Mizraim\[<a href="#foot7" id="text7">7</a>\] and Phut were all deified
there, while the supreme God was incontrovertibly known; and the sun was
only a symbol and the supposed abode of Adam. There is reason to believe
that the state of things in Chaldea and Babylon was substantially the
same as this."

To this we may append the remark that the Egyptians appear to have
recognized the partial truth that there be "that are called gods,
whether in heaven or on earth, as there be gods many and lords many,"
but were ignorant of the corollary, "but to us there is but one God the
Father." (1 Corinthians, viii, v. 5, 6.)

It must be evident from the light thown on the early history of the
world, more especially of Egypt, by the Book of Abraham, that under the
almost universally existing form of patriarchal government that "the
fathers" were not only High Priests unto God by right of their
"fatherhood," but also the kings of the earth by that same
right,\[<a href="#foot8" id="text8">8</a>\] and it was 0ne of the
easiest things in the world for the descendants of these men, who ruled
by right divine, to not only reverence them as ministers of heaven's
will in all things, temporal and spiritual, but also to deify and
afterwards worship them. Indeed in the case of most of these holy
patriarchs it was but a very small step in advance of their true
position in relation to the sons of men; for "He called them Gods unto
whom the word of God came, and the scriptures cannot be broken." (John,
x, 35.)

We next appeal to Mr. Osborn, author of "The Religions of the World." In
writing of the Egyptian mythology, he states: "This most ancient
mythology, as described by authors who lived before the Christian era,
and as set forth on the walls of the temples in which its ritual or
worship was performed, was taught to the initiated and concealed from
the vulgar, that God created all things at the first by the primary
emanation from himself, his firstborn, who was the author and giver of
all knowledge in heaven and on earth, being at the same time the wisdom
and the word of God. The birth of this all-powerful being, his
manifestation as an infant, his nurture and education through all the
succeeding periods of childhood and of boyhood, constituted the grand
mystery of the entire system." So convinced were the priests of this
people of the coming of a Son of God, that they had chambers prepared in
their temples for his nativity.

Another quotation from Mr. Osborn will, we trust, make the matter yet
clearer to our readers. He says: "The founders of the nation knew not
only of Ham and Mizriam, but of various men and women contemporary with,
them, even of our first parents, Adam and Eve, as well as of our second
progenitors, Noah and his wife Tamer. Adam has thus been handed down to
us as Athom, the guide or governor of the sun; Eve *as* Hathor, who
presided over the moon; Noah as Nuh, who presided over the Nile; while
Ham, Mizraim, Phut, Neveth, or Neith, the wife of Ham, and others,
occupied singular and sometimes multiform positions and offices in the
Egyptian Pantheon."\[<a href="#foot9" id="text9">9</a>\]

We will now leave modern writers, and draw attention to that wonderful
papyrus, the Ancient Egyptian Ritual or Book of the Dead, and from its
hieroglyphics show the relation in which Adam stood in their mythology,
reminding our readers that the abode of the great father of humanity was
supposed by them to be the sun, and that the chief seat of his worship
was at Heliopolis, the city of the sun, the On of the Scriptures,
Aseniath, a daughter of one of whose priests was married to Joseph, the
son of Jacob.

Our extracts are necessarily brief, and simply intended to prove the
trustworthiness of the quotations already made.

In the fifteenth chapter it is written :

"The praise of Athom\[<a href="#foot10" id="text10">10</a>\] when he
sets from the land of life, saith the
Osir,\[<a href="#foot11" id="text11">11</a>\]

" Glory be to Athom, setting from the gate of life,

"When his colors glow in the western gate of the horizon,

"Hail to thee setting from the land of life,

"Thou father of the Gods."

Again, (chapter xvii,) Adam is represented as saying:

"I am the great God, creating myself;

"I am the great Phoenix which is in On;

"I am the creator of beings and existences."

In another place it proclaims:

"Glory be to thee, O Sun; glory be to thee, O Athom,

"When thou goest down, perfect, crowned and glorious."

Adam is also called "the old man whose palace is at On," the "God alone
in the firmament," "Father Athom," "Righteous Athom," and much more.
Probably were we better versed in the mysteries of its hieroglyphics and
idioms, the translation of this wonderful testimony to the belief of the
ancients in the immortality of the soul, which this ritual is, would be
yet plainer and more instructive. As it is, much of its imagery is very
difficult for modern minds to grasp.

From the Egyptians we will turn to the Persians, the people next most
likely to show traces in their religion of the influence left by the
preaching of the Gospel in patriarchal days. Mr. Hyde, in his "Religion
of the Ancient Persians," points out how that Magianism, as set forth in
its sacred books, taught that the human race sprang from a single pair;
that it bore testimony to the occurrence of the flood; that it mentions
Noah and his sons; that as far as Abraham is concerned, it declares him
to have been its own author; and that it makes mention also of Moses.
Moreover, it contains predictions respecting the appearance on earth of
a Savior, who would ultimately overthrow the kingdom of darkness and
make supreme and universal the kingdom of light and of God. It also
taught the existence of good and of bad angels, also a resurrection of
the dead.

The religions of ancient Greece and Rome were, to a very great extent,
originally drawn from those of Egypt, Persia and Phoenicia. Many traces
of Gospel principles can be found in them, hidden concealed under the
mass of filth and abomination that in later ages disgraced the religions
of the kingdoms of brass and iron. Still, in all these nations it is
admitted that "so far from atheism and godless irreligion being the
rule, belief in the Divine, however mistaken, and worship of the Divine,
however superstitious, everywhere prevailed." With regard to special
Gospel ideas prevailing in all these nations, it has been remarked that
"baptism was as completely a portion of the primeval ceremonial worship
as was the tenet of immortality and resurrection a portion of the
primeval creed." It is also noticeable that all the Greek schools of
philosophy taught the doctrine of the eternity of matter, and not only
had these races a knowledge of things that occurred in antediluvian
days, but in their different, absurd ways they recounted the history of
the war in heaven when Lucifer was cast out. Those curious on this point
can read their accounts of the war between the Titians and Heaven, and
of the giants against Jupiter.

Late discoveries at Nineveh have demonstrated that the Chaldeans had
also a very distinct tradition of this pre-Adamite war, as many
particulars relating thereto have been found transcribed on the earthen
tiles exhumed from the mounds where that once mighty city is supposed to
have stood. These tablets having been translated by Mr. Geo. Smith, of
the British Museum, prove to be an account of the war in heaven before
the creation of this earth, of the fall of man, of the flood, the
building of the tower of Babel, etc. The similarity between the
statements on these cuneiform records and the Bible account of the same
events is very remarkable and interesting, while at the same time they
prove how wide spread in ancient times was the knowledge of God's
dealings with humanity.
