# THE STORY OF "MORMONISM"

### CHAPTER I

In the minds of many, perhaps of the majority of people, the scene of
the "Mormon" drama is laid almost entirely in Utah; indeed, the terms
"Mormon question" and "Utah question" have been often used
interchangeably. True it is, that the development of "Mormonism" is
closely associated with the history of the long-time Territory and
present State of Utah; but the origin of the system must be sought in
regions far distant from the present gathering-place of the Latter-day
Saints, and at a period antedating the acquisition of Utah as a part of
our national domain.

The term "origin" is here used in its commonest application--that of the
first stages apparent to ordinary observation--the visible birth of the
system. But a long, long period of preparation had led to this physical
coming forth of the "Mormon" religion, a period marked by a multitude of
historical events, some of them preceding by centuries the earthly
beginning of this modern system of prophetic trust. The "Mormon" people
regard the establishment of their Church as the culmination of a great
series of notable events. To them it is the result of causes unnumbered
that have operated through ages of human history, and they see in it the
cause of many developments yet to appear. This to them establishes an
intimate relationship between the events of their own history and the
prophecies of ancient times.

In reading the earliest pages of "Mormon" history, we are introduced to
a man whose name will ever be prominent in the story of the Church--the
founder of the organization by common usage of the term, the head of the
system as an earthly establishment--one who is accepted by the Church as
an ambassador specially commissioned of God to be the first revelator of
the latter-day dispensation. This man is Joseph Smith, commonly known as
the "Mormon" prophet. Rarely indeed does history present an
organization, religious, social, or political, in which an individual
holds as conspicuous and in all ways as important a place as does this
man in the development of "Mormonism." The earnest investigator, the
sincere truth-seeker, can ignore neither the man nor his work; for the
Church under consideration has risen from the testimony solemnly set
forth and the startling declarations made by this person, who, at the
time of his earliest announcements, was a farmer's boy in the first half
of his teens. If his claims to ordination under the hands of divinely
commissioned messengers be fallacious, forming as they form the
foundation of the Church organization, the superstructure cannot stand;
if, on the other hand, such declarations be true, there is little cause
to wonder at the phenomenally rapid rise and the surprising stability of
the edifice so begun.

Joseph Smith was born at Sharon, Vermont, in December, 1805. He was the
son of industrious parents, who possessed strong religious tendencies
and tolerant natures. For generations his ancestors had been laborers,
by occupation tillers of the soil; and though comfortable circumstances
had generally been their lot, reverses and losses in the father's house
had brought the family to poverty; so that from his earliest days the
lad Joseph was made acquainted with the pleasures and pains of hard
work. He is described as having been more than ordinarily studious for
his years; and when that powerful wave of religious agitation and
sectarian revival which characterized the first quarter of the last
century, reached the home of the Smiths, Joseph with others of the
family was profoundly affected. The household became somewhat divided on
the subject of religion, and some of the members identified themselves
with the more popular sects; but Joseph, while favorably impressed by
the Methodists in comparison with others, confesses that his mind was
sorely troubled over the contemplation of the strife and tumult existing
among the religious bodies; and he hesitated. He tried in vain to solve
the mystery presented to him in the warring factions of what professed
to be the Church of Christ. Surely, thought he, these several churches,
opposed as they are to one another on what appear to be the vital points
of religion, cannot all be right. While puzzling over this anomaly he
chanced upon this verse in the epistle of St. James:

"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men
liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."

In common with so many others, the earnest youth found here within the
scriptures, admonition and counsel as directly applicable to his case
and circumstances as if the lines had been addressed to him by name. A
brief period of hesitation, in which he shrank from the thought that a
mortal like himself, weak, youthful, and unlearned, should approach the
Creator with a personal request, was followed by a humble and contrite
resolution to act upon the counsel of the ancient apostle. The result,
to which he bore solemn record (testifying at first with the simplicity
and enthusiasm of youth, afterward confirming the declaration with
manhood's increasing powers, and at last voluntarily sealing the
testimony with his life's blood,) proved most startling to the sectarian
world--a world in which according to popular belief no new revelation of
truth was possible. It is a surprising fact that while growth, progress,
advancement, development of known truths and the acquisition of new
ones, characterize every living science, the sectarian world has
declared that nothing new must be expected as direct revelation from
God.

The testimony of this lad is, that in response to his supplication,
drawn forth by the admonition of an inspired apostle, he received a
divine ministration; heavenly beings manifested themselves to him--two,
clothed in purity, and alike in form and feature. Pointing to the other,
one said, "This is my beloved Son, hear Him." In answer to the lad's
prayer, the heavenly personage so designated informed Joseph that the
Spirit of God dwelt not with warring sects, which, while professing a
form of godliness, denied the power thereof, and that he should join
none of them. Overjoyed at the glorious manifestation thus granted unto
him, the boy prophet could not withhold from relatives and acquaintances
tidings of the heavenly vision. From the ministers, who had been so
energetic in their efforts to convert the boy, he received, to his
surprise, abuse and ridicule. "Visions and manifestations from God,"
said they, "are of the past, and all such things ceased with the
apostles of old; the canon of scripture is full; religion has reached
its perfection in plan, and, unlike all other systems contrived or
accepted by human kind, is incapable of development or growth. It is
true God lives, but He cares not for His children of modern times as He
did for those of ancient days; He has shut Himself away from the people,
closed the windows of heaven, and has suspended all direct communication
with the people of earth."

The persecution thus originating with those who called themselves
ministers of the gospel of Christ spread throughout the community; and
the sects that before could not agree together nor abide in peace,
became as one in their efforts to oppose the youth who thus testified of
facts, which though vehemently denounced, produced an effect that
alarmed them the more. And such a spectacle has ofttimes presented
itself before the world--men who cannot tolerate one another in peace
swear fidelity and mutual support in strife with a common opponent. The
importance of this alleged revelation from the heavens to the earth is
such as to demand attentive consideration. If a fact, it is a full
contradiction of the vague theories that had been increasing and
accumulating for centuries, denying personality and parts to Deity.

In 1820, there lived one person who knew that the word of the Creator,
"Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness," had a meaning
more than in metaphor. Joseph Smith, the youthful prophet and revelator
of the nineteenth century, knew that the Eternal Father and the
well-beloved Son, Jesus Christ, were in form and stature like unto
perfect men; and that the human family was in very truth of divine
origin. But this wonderful vision was not the only manifestation of
heavenly power and personality made to the young man, nor the only
incident of the kind destined to bring upon him the fury of persecution.
Sometime after this visitation, which constituted him a living witness
of God unto men, and which demonstrated the great fact that humanity is
the child of Deity, he was visited by an immortal personage who
announced himself as Moroni, a messenger sent from the presence of God.
The celestial visitor stated that through Joseph as the earthly agent
the Lord would accomplish a great work, and that the boy would come to
be known by good and evil repute amongst all nations. The angel then
announced that an ancient record, engraven on plates of gold, lay hidden
in a hill near by, which record gave a history of the nations that had
of old inhabited the American continent, and an account of the Savior's
ministrations among them. He further explained that with the plates were
two sacred stones, known as Urim and Thummim, by the use of which the
Lord would bring forth a translation of the ancient record. Joseph
further testifies that he was told that if he remained faithful to his
trust and the confidence reposed in him, he would some day receive the
record into his keeping, and be commissioned and empowered to translate
it. In due time these promises were literally fulfilled, and the modern
version of these ancient writings was given to the world.

The record proved to be an account of certain colonies of immigrants to
this hemisphere from the east, who came several centuries before the
Christian era. The principal company was led by one Lehi, described as a
personage of some importance and wealth, who had formerly lived at
Jerusalem in the reign of Zedekiah, and who left his eastern home about
600 B.C. The book tells of the journeyings across the water in vessels
constructed according to revealed plan, of the peoples' landing on the
western shores of South America probably somewhere in Chile, of their
prosperity and rapid growth amid the bounteous elements of the new
world, of the increase of pride and consequent dissension accompanying
the accumulation of material wealth, and of the division of the people
into factions which became later two great nations at enmity with one
another. One part following Nephi, the youngest and most gifted son of
Lehi, designated themselves *Nephites*; the other faction, led by Laman,
the elder and wicked brother of Nephi, were known as *Lamanites*.

The Nephites lived in cities, some of which attained great size and were
distinguished by great architectural beauty. Continually advancing
northward, these people in time occupied the greater part of the valleys
of the Orinoco, the Amazon, and the Magdalena. During the thousand years
covered by the Nephite record, the people crossed the Isthmus of Panama,
which is graphically described as a neck of land but a day's journey
from sea to sea, and successively occupied extensive tracts in what is
now Mexico, the valley of the Mississippi, and the Eastern States. It is
not to be supposed that these vast regions were all populated at any one
time by the Nephites; the people were continually moving to escape the
depredations of their hereditary foes, the Lamanites; and they abandoned
in turn all their cities established along the course of migration. The
unprejudiced student sees in the discoveries of the ancient and now
forest-covered cities of Mexico, Central America, Yucatan, and the
northern regions of South America, collateral testimony having a bearing
upon this history.

Before their more powerful foes, the Nephites dwindled and fled; until
about the year 400 A.D. they were entirely annihilated after a series of
decisive battles, the last of which was fought near the very hill,
called Cumorah, in the State of New York, where the hidden record was
subsequently revealed to Joseph Smith.

The Lamanites led a roving, aggressive life; kept few or no records, and
soon lost the art of history writing. They lived on the results of the
chase and by plunder, degenerating in habit until they became typical
progenitors of the dark-skinned race, afterward discovered by Columbus
and named American Indians.

The last writer in the ancient record, and the one who hid away the
plates in the hill Cumorah, was Moroni--the same personage who appeared
as a resurrected being in the nineteenth century, a divinely appointed
messenger sent to reveal the depository of the sacred documents; but the
greater part of the plates since translated had been engraved by the
father of Moroni, the Nephite prophet Mormon. This man, at once warrior,
prophet and historian, had made a transcript and compilation of the
heterogeneous records that had accumulated during the troubled history
of the Nephite nation; this compilation was named on the plates "The
Book of Mormon," which name has been given to the modern translation--a
work that has already made its way over most of the civilized world. The
translation and publication of the Book of Mormon were marked by many
scenes of trouble and contention, but success attended the undertaking,
and the first edition of the work appeared in print in 1830.

The question, "What is the Book of Mormon?"--a very pertinent one on the
part of every earnest student and investigator of this phase of American
history--has been partly answered already. The work has been derisively
called the "Mormon Bible," a name that carries with it the
misrepresentation that in the faith of this people the book takes the
place of the scriptural volume which is universally accepted by
Christian sects. No designation could be more misleading, and in every
way more untruthful. The Latter-day Saints have but one "Bible" and that
the Holy Bible of Christendom. They place it foremost amongst the
standard works of the Church; they accept its admonitions and its
doctrines, and accord thereto a literal significance; it is to them, and
ever has been, the word of God, a compilation made by human agency of
works by various inspired writers; they accept its teachings in fulness,
modifying the meaning in no wise, except in the rare cases of undoubted
mistranslation, concerning which Biblical scholars of all faiths differ
and criticize; and even in such cases their reverence for the sacred
letter renders them even more conservative than the majority of Bible
commentators and critics in placing free construction upon the text. The
historical part of the Jewish scriptures tells of the divine dealings
with the people of the eastern hemisphere; the Book of Mormon recounts
the mercies and judgments of God, the inspired teachings of His
prophets, the rise and fall of His people as organized communities on
the western continent.

The Latter-day Saints believe the coming forth of the Book of Mormon to
have been foretold in the Bible, as its destiny is prophesied of within
its own lids; it is to the people the true "stick of Ephraim" which
Ezekiel declared should become one with the "stick of Judah"--or the
Bible. The people challenge the most critical comparison between this
record of the west and the Holy Scriptures of the east, feeling
confident that no discrepancy exists in letter or spirit. As to the
original characters in which the record was engraved, copies were shown
to learned linguists of the day and pronounced by them as closely
resembling the Reformed Egyptian writing.

Let us revert, however, to the facts of history concerning this new
scripture, and the reception accorded the printed volume.

The Book of Mormon was before the world; the Church circulated the work
as freely as possible. The true account of its origin was rejected by
the general public, who thus, assumed the responsibility of explaining
in some plausible way the source of the record. Among the many false
theories propounded, perhaps the most famous is the so-called Spaulding
story. Solomon Spaulding, a clergyman of Amity, Pennsylvania, died in
1816. He wrote a romance to which no name other than "Manuscript Story"
was given, and which, but for the unauthorized use of the writer's name
and the misrepresentation of his motives, would never have been
published. Twenty years after the author's death, one Hurlburt, an
apostate "Mormon," announced that he had recognized a resemblance
between the "Manuscript Story" and the Book of Mormon, and expressed a
belief that the work brought forward by Joseph Smith was nothing but the
Spaulding romance revised and amplified. The apparent credibility of the
statement was increased by various signed declarations to the effect
that the two were alike, though no extracts for comparison were
presented. But the "Manuscript Story" was lost for a time, and in the
absence of proof to the contrary, reports of the parallelism between the
two works multiplied. By a fortunate circumstance, in 1884, President
James H. Fairchild, of Oberlin College, and a literary friend of his--a
Mr. Rice--while examining a heterogeneous collection of old papers which
had been purchased by the gentleman last named, found the original
manuscript of the "Story."

After a careful perusal and comparison with the Book of Mormon,
President Fairchild declared in an article published in the New York
*Observer*, February 5, 1885:

The theory of the origin of the Book of Mormon in the traditional
manuscript of Solomon Spaulding will probably have to be relinquished.
\* \* \* Mr. Rice, myself, and others compared it \[the Spaulding
manuscript\] with the Book of Mormon and could detect no resemblance
between the two, in general or in detail. There seems to be no name nor
incident common to the two. The solemn style of the Book of Mormon in
imitation of the English scriptures does not appear in the manuscript.
\* \* \* Some other explanation of the origin of the Book of Mormon must
be found if any explanation is required.

The manuscript was deposited in the library of Oberlin College where it
now reposes. Still, the theory of the "Manuscript Found," as Spaulding's
story has come to be known, is occasionally pressed into service in the
cause of anti-"Mormon" zeal, by some whom we will charitably believe to
be ignorant of the facts set forth by President Fairchild. A letter of
more recent date, written by that honorable gentleman in reply to an
inquiring correspondent, was published in the *Millennial Star*,
Liverpool, November 3, 1898, and is as follows:

OBERLIN COLLEGE, OHIO,  
October 17, 1895.

J. R. HINDLEY, ESQ.,

Dear Sir: We have in our college library an original manuscript of
Solomon Spaulding--unquestionably genuine.

I found it in 1884 in the hands of Hon. L. L. Rice, of Honolulu,
Hawaiian Islands. He was formerly state printer at Columbus, Ohio, and
before that, publisher of a paper in Painesville, whose preceding
publisher had visited Mrs. Spaulding and obtained the manuscript from
her. It had lain among his old papers forty years or more, and was
brought out by my asking him to look up anti-slavery documents among his
papers.

The manuscript has upon it the signatures of several men of Conneaught,
Ohio, who had heard Spaulding read it and knew it to be his. No one can
see it and question its genuineness. The manuscript has been printed
twice, at least;--once by the Mormons of Salt Lake City, and once by the
Josephite Mormons of Iowa. The Utah Mormons obtained the copy of Mr.
Rice, at Honolulu, and the Josephites got it of me after it came into my
possession.

This manuscript is not the original of the Book of Mormon.

Yours very truly,  
         JAMES H. FAIRCHILD.

The "Manuscript Story" has been published in full, and comparisons
between the same and the Book of Mormon may be made by anyone who has a
mind to investigate the subject. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)
