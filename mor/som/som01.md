# PREFACE

The Story of "Mormonism" as presented in the following pages is a
revised and reconstructed version of lectures delivered by Dr. James E.
Talmage at the University of Michigan, Cornell University, and
elsewhere. The "Story" first appeared in print as a lecture report in
the *Improvement Era*, and was afterward issued as a booklet from the
office of the *Millennial Star*, Liverpool. In 1910 it was issued in a
revised form by the Bureau of Information at Salt Lake City, in which
edition the lecture style of direct address was changed to the ordinary
form of essay. The present or third American edition has been revised
and amplified by the author.

The "Story" has been translated and published abroad. Already versions
have appeared in Swedish, modern Greek, and Russian.

The subject matter of *The Philosophy of "Mormonism"* was first
presented as a lecture delivered by Dr. Talmage before the Philosophical
Society of Denver. It appeared later in the columns of the *Improvement
Era*, and translations have been published in pamphlet form in the
Danish and German languages.

The present publication of these two productions is made in response to
a steady demand.

THE PUBLISHERS.

Salt Lake City, Utah,  
March, 1914.
