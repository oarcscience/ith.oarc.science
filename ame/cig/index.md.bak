This is a folklore miscellany originally published by the Texas
Folk-lore society in 1923, and reprinted in 1935. The articles reflect
the cultural diversity of Texas, including articles on African-American,
Tejano, German and Native American folklore. One of the highlights is
[an interview](cig12.md) with W.C. Handy, 'the father of the blues;' the
lyrics in this piece foreshadow some of the great rock compositions of
the sixties. The articles vary widely from academic to amateur in tone.
As usual, the original text has been transcribed verbatim. It reflects
the time and place in which it was written, and includes ethnic terms
and characterizations which today would be considered wildly offensive,
even in an ethnographic context. *Caveat lector*.

Thanks to Eliza Yetter for transcribing this collection.
