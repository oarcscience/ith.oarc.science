### WOMAN'S PLACE IS IN THE HOME AND IN THE HARVEST FIELDS

**Faithful Wives and Workers**.—The plain women have their hands full
looking after the general work in the house, preparing meals for hungry
men and children; tending the garden and cattle; it is nothing strange
to see them work in the fields alongside the men and render a good
account of themselves at whatever they put a hand to do.

Naturally hands exposed to toil such as makes up their lives every day
in the year, do not come out soft and lovely. They have lots of mending
to do, and somehow these families get along through life with few of the
things which the rest of the world calls "necessary modern conveniences
and appliances."

The outdoors of the farmer and his family give them that close communion
with the ground that we hear many mothers speak of when children in the
city are unhealthy, or unruly, or want to get out to play—"if they could
only get into the ground—it's healthy for them—it's what they need."

There is a large amount of housework to be done, aside from cooking and
sewing, etc.  a lot of cleaning, since the large kitchen is the place
where the family gathers when work gives way to rest.

There are generally no such things as linen on their kitchen tables
which is where the family always dines,

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

but their tables are scrubbed daily until the wood finally becomes quite
smooth. Heavy coarse dishes serve their purpose.

Some of the finest-looking and best-kept farms to be seen in many days'
driving can be found in the section northeast, ’round-about New Holland.
Try it.

**Furniture** is always of the plainest sort; occasional guests are
entertained in the parlor—especially the minister. Bed rooms are
furnished with such pieces of furniture considered as being absolutely
necessary. The beds may be of the old-fashioned rope variety. Plainness
is used severely in most everything they have or use. Even closet space
is in the rough—clothing merely being covered with a cloth.

They light the homes with oil; they can find no excuse in the Bible for
electricity, or for many other modern day conveniences in the house or
barn.

In the old log-cabin days among our early settlers, when they had but
one or two rooms in the house, it was the custom for one and all to
bathe in the common washtub. Even today this can easily be the rule
among the folk living along the back-woods sections of the country, not
of the Amish persuasion, necessarily—and in many sections of this vast
country. We cannot imagine the backwoodsman walking, driving, or hiking
to towns, or cities, just for the pleasure of taking a bath—privately!

We have heard of more than just one or two instances in which man, wife,
children; uncles and aunts together observe the rule of cleanliness
without the single thought that their nakedness might stimulate sex
excitement in each other. A working knowledge of impoverished conditions
among the poor in the coal regions, in the city slums, and in the
mountain and southern "squatter" sections might reveal a great number of
instances of "bathing in the raw" with all the family present.

**Few Vices**.—If one goes to the trouble to visit these plain people in
Lancaster, or any county where they may be found, one is startled at the
sweet innocence of their children, to whom vices rarely come, because
these are avoided through a constant religious pressure. Their parents
are not addicted, and they do not allow the children to associate with,
if at all avoidable, other children whose parents are known to
dissipate.

**The Library** of the plain people during the past few generations
might have consisted of the Bible, a hymn-book, prayer-hook, catechism,
a sermon-book, and perhaps a few other books on devotion.

In later years a book of "pow wows" conforming to authority given by
Jesus to the Elders of the Church, and evidencing some use and nurture
among their forbears, was to become a household book, at least with
others of German extraction. Known as a "ga-brauch buch," it had a wide
circulation, and is still in demand by the descendants of orthodox
families and many non-Amish who have heard of its virtue.
