**In Haste**.—Amish woman on a cold day going to a public "vendue," one
of their delights and a way to save money.

**Contrast**.—An Amishman and helpmate on a wagon with modern springs,
passing a school building in Belleville. Education in the higher grades
is op-posed by them as unnecessary and tending toward worldliness. ()

**Bonnets and Shawls**.—The Amish, too, have time for conversation. Note
the bonnets, and initials low on shawl, left. ([Upper row,
center](#img_01601).md)

**Satisfaction**.—Here we see the contented expression of a successful
bidder at a public sale. Possibly the woman in the foreground did the
bidding for the one to the left, while the one in the center says: "Oh!"
([Upper right](#img_01700).md)

**All Together** . . . Broad-brimmed hats, full-grown whiskers, heavy
sweaters, a great-coat or two, and a bonnet. We don't know what she
might be saying, but her audience is giving her all possible attention.

"Rule of Thumb."—Patriarchal Amishman in animated conversation indicates
his "point" by an old standard. ([Lower row, center](#img_01603).md)

**Transportation**—Nearly every "Old Order" Amishman has a buggy as the
highest type of transportation with which to get to town. Patterned so
alike, it remains for the Amish to say: "We know ’em!" ([Lower
right](#img_01701).md)

**Father and Son**.—Amishman with store suspenders and "broadfall" pants
(no fly) . . . and a bewildered-looking boy.

**Curiosity**.—The child on the left just "wants to see" . . . while the
one in the center "listens in" on the conversation.

**Religion** . . . is the topic of this pair, as when most Amish gather.
Child, in center, and man at right, eat ice cream.

**Planning**.—"I got the stuff at my own price, now I wonder how I'll
ever get it 'to home' without a neighbor's help."
