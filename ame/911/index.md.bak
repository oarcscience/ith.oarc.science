# 9/11/2001: A REMEMBRANCE

One of the few good things that came out of the 9/11 tragedy was a
high-water mark for unity and religious tolerance in the United States.
At gatherings small and large Christians, Jews, Muslims and others
jointly offered prayers for the dead and for world peace. In many
communities, people of all faiths stood vigil to protect mosques. This
outpouring of ecumenical support far outweighed the few random attacks
on Muslims. And Muslims worldwide condemned the attacks as a distortion
of Islam. This is worth remembering in light of subsequent events.

This page archives some key documents of the 9/11 attack, including the
list of casualties, and the report of the US government commission,
which was completed in 2004.

### OTHER RESOURCES AT SACRED-TEXTS

Shortly after the disaster, Intangible Textual Heritage received nearly
a million hits in one day, which was twenty times the normal traffic at
that point. This was primarily because of wild (and incorrect) rumors
circulating via email that Nostradamus had predicted 9/11. Fortunately,
this site has [a complete cache of Nostradamus in English and
French](../../nos/index.md) so it was possible to refute the bogus quatrain
that was being circulated. In the process, though, I found another
obscure quatrain that had a certain resonance...

Another question which was being publicly debated was whether the
attacks were sanctioned by Islam. As luck would have it, I was working
on an etext of the Hadith, which has numerous passages which clarify
this question, so I accelarated my work. I posted the etext of the
Hadith on October 9th, 2001.

### OTHER DOCUMENTS

[Remarks of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, 9/13/2004](700club.md)  
These embarrassing remarks by two prominent Evangelical (conservative)
Christian clergy caused quite a bit of criticism, by blaming Muslims in
general, as well as the ACLU and other liberal groups, Pagans,
feminists, gays and lesbians, and (strangest of all) abortionists for
9/11. Unfortunately for them, their little cracker-barrel bull session
was being aired on national TV. Of course, these views should not be
taken to represent the attitude of the majority of US Christians, or of
any particular religious group, or of this site.

  
[Speech of President Bush to joint session of Congress,
9/21/2001](bush0921.md)  
In counterpoint, President George W. Bush, an Evangelical Christian
himself, to his credit, took care at the time to identify the real
source of the attacks, the terrorist group Al-Qaeda. His remarks also
stressed religious tolerance and outreach to mainstream Islam. This
speech was only one of several he and other US political leaders made at
the time which sounded this theme.
