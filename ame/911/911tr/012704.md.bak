AND SECURITY, UNITED AIRLINES;

ANDREW P. STUDDERT, FORMER CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, UNITED AIRLINES;

GERARD J. ARPEY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AMERICAN AIRLINES;

TIMOTHY J. AHERN, VICE PRESIDENT - DFW HUB, AND FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF
SAFETY, SECURITY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL, AMERICAN AIRLINES;

PANEL III:

NYDIA GONZALEZ, MANAGER, SOUTHEAST RESERVATION CENTER, AMERICAN
AIRLINES;

PANEL IV:

JAMES M. LOY, DEPUTY SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

MR. THOMAS H. KEAN: I'd like to call the hearing to order. First I would
like to enter into the record a statement on aviation security by Carol
Ashley. Ms. Ashley is a member of the Family Steering Committee and if
there's no objection, so ordered.

Yesterday we heard testimony about how the 9/11 terrorists were able to
circumvent the border controls the United States had in place at the
time. Today, we will look at what confronted them in the final stage of
their mission of mass murder: the American civil aviation security
system as it existed in early September 2001.

Both yesterday and today we looked at the system's vulnerabilities. We
will start by examining two of the most important components of that
system, the Federal Aviation Administration that regulated it and the
airlines which had the responsibility of implementing some of its key
elements. Our witnesses will be expected to shed some light not only on
the systematic issues but on specifics of the 9/11 hijackings
themselves.

After these panels, we'll hear about one of the real heroes of Flight
11, Flight 11 attendant Betty Ong, from who's work on that day reflects
well on her professionalism -- from another, rather, who's work on that
day reflects well on her professionalism and her humanity, Ms. Nydia
Gonzales. We will conclude with testimony from Admiral James Loy, deputy
secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and formerly head of
the Transportation Security Administration as well as commandant of the
Coast Guard. We will focus on one key question with Admiral Loy, how do
we, or should we, determine our priorities for homeland security,
especially in the transportation sector.

In order to provide commissioners and the listening public with context
for the testimony we are about to receive, we will once again begin by
hearing from the 9/11 Commission staff and what it has learned to date
relevant to today's proceedings. I would caution our listeners to bear
in mind that this statement is still a work in progress. It addresses
the various civil aviation defense layers and how the hijackers beat
them in gaining entry to the aircraft.

The Commission staff will present a second staff statement immediately
preceding Ms. Gonzales' testimony. That statement will take up the story
of the four hijacked flights. It too is a preliminary report, making
public what our staff has learned to the present time. I want to caution
our audience, especially the families and friends of the victims of
9/11, that today we will be presenting a number of the harrowing facts,
sights, and sounds of that particular day.

On another note, today's session will not focus on the situational
awareness of air traffic control system and the Department of Defense
including NORAD. The Commission will deal with that important topic in
another public hearing, this spring. I would like to call on Mr.
Zelikow, executive director of the Commission, Mr. John Raidt and Mr.
William Johnstone, who will present the statement of the Commission
staff.

MR. PHILIP D. ZELIKOW: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Members of the Commission, working with you, your staff has developed
initial findings on how the individuals who carried out the 9/11 attacks
defeated the civil aviation security system of the United States. We
continue our investigation into the status of civil aviation security
today and for the future. These findings and judgments may help your
conduct of today's public hearing and will inform the development of
your recommendations.

The findings and judgments we report today are the results of the work
so far. We remain ready to revise our understanding of these topics as
our work continues. This staff statement represents the collective
effort of the staff team on aviation and transportation security. Our
staff was able to build upon investigative work that has been conducted
by various agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security
Administration is fully cooperating with our investigators, as are the
relevant airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration.

I'd now like to turn to John Raidt to continue.

MR. JOHN RAIDT: Thank you, Philip.

Mr. Chairman and members of the Commission, before September 11th, 2001
the aviation security system had been enjoying a period of relative
peace. No U.S. flagged aircraft had been bombed or hijacked in over a
decade. Domestic hijacking in particular seemed like a thing of the
past, something that could only happen to foreign airlines that were
less well protected. The public's own threat assessment before September
11th was sanguine about commercial aviation safety and security.

In a Fox News opinion dynamic survey conducted at the end of the 1990s,
78 percent cited poor maintenance as a greater threat to airline safety
than terrorism. The demand for airline service was strong and was
beginning to exceed the capacity of the system. Heeding constituents
calls for improved air service and increased capacity, Congress focused
its legislative and oversight attention on measures to address these
problems including a passenger bill of rights to ensure a more efficient
and convenient passenger experience.

The leadership of the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, also focused
on safety, customer service, capacity and economic issues. The agency's
security agenda was focused on efforts to implement a three-year-old
congressional mandate to deploy explosive detection equipment at all
major airports and complete a nearly five-year-old rule-making effort to
improve checkpoint screening. This staff statement will not address
certain security performance issues leading up to 9/11 at the airports
from which the hijackers' planes departed. Such work is still ongoing.

It should be noted that the airports themselves did not have operational
or enforcement jurisdiction over checkpoint screening operations,
passenger pre-screening and checkpoint screening, based on regulations
from the FAA these were the responsibility of the air carriers.
Nevertheless, airport authorities do play a key role in the overall
civil aviation security system.

Before September 11th, federal law required the FAA to set and enforce
aviation security policies and regulations that would quote, "Protect
passengers and property on an aircraft operating an air transportation
or intrastate air transportation against an act of criminal violence or
aircraft piracy." This layered system, one that recognized that no
single security measure was flawless or impenetrable, was designed to
provide a greater number of opportunities to foil those intending to do
such violence.

The civil aviation security system in place on September 11th was
composed of seven layers of defense including: Intelligence, passenger
pre-screening, airport access control, passenger checkpoint screening,
passenger check baggage screening, cargo screening and onboard security.
The civil aviation security system in place on September 11th no longer
exists. We will document serious shortcomings in that system's design
and implementation that made the 9/11 hijackings possible.

We want to make clear that our findings of specific vulnerabilities and
shortcomings do not necessarily apply to the current system. Two of the
layers of defense, checked baggage screening and cargo screening are not
relevant to the 9/11 plot, they are not addressed in this statement. A
third layer, airport access control is still under investigation and
also will not be addressed in detail here.

Compelling evidence, including video tape of hijackers entering through
checkpoint screening stations, suggest that the hijackers gained access
to the aircraft on September 11th through passenger checkpoints. What we
do know is that the hijackers successfully evaded or defeated the
remaining four layers of the security system. We approached the question
of how the aviation security system failed on September 11th by starting
from the perspective of the enemy, asking: What did al Qaeda have to do
to complete its mission?

Sometime during the late 1990s the al Qaeda leadership made the decision
to hijack large commercial multi-engine aircraft and use them as a
devastating weapon, as opposed to hijacking a commercial aircraft for
use as a bargaining tool. To carry out that decision required unique
skill sets. Among them, terrorists trained as pilots with specialized
skill and confidence to successfully fly a large multi-engine aircraft
already airborne into selected targets; tactics, techniques and
procedures to successfully conduct in-flight hijacking; and three,
operatives willing to die.

To our knowledge, 9/11 was the first time in history that terrorists
actually piloted a commercial jetliner in a terrorist operation. This
was new. This could not happen overnight and would require long term
planning and sequenced operational training. The terrorists had to
determine the tactics and techniques needed to succeed and hijack an
aircraft within the United States. The vulnerabilities of the U.S.
domestic commercial aviation security system were well advertised
through numerous unclassified reports from agencies such as the General
Accounting Office and the Department of Transportation's inspector
general. The news media had publicized those findings.

The al Qaeda leadership recognized the need for more specific
information though. Its agents observed the system first hand and
conducted surveillance flights both internationally and within the
United States. Over time, this information allowed them to revise and
refine their operational plan. By the spring of 2001, the September 11
operation had combined intent with capabilities to present a real and
present threat to the civil aviation system. As long as operational
security was maintained the plan had a high probability of success in
conducting multiple near simultaneous attacks on New York City and
Washington, DC.

Let us turn now to a more specific look at the security system in place
on September 11th, related to anti-hijacking. We'll begin with
intelligence. The first layer of defense in aviation security was
intelligence. While the FAA was not a member of the U.S. Intelligence
Committee per se, the agency maintained a civil aviation intelligence
division that operated 24 hours per day. The intelligence watch was the
collection point for a flow of threat related information from federal
agencies, particularly the FBI, CIA and State Department.

FAA intelligence personnel were assigned as liaisons to work within
these three agencies to facilitate the flow of aviation related
information to the FAA and to promote inter-departmental cooperation.
The FAA did not assign liaisons to either the National Security Agency
or the Defense Intelligence Agency but maintained intelligence
requirements with those agencies.

Intelligence data received by the FAA went into preparing intelligence
case files. These files tracked and assessed the significance of
aviation security incidents, threats and emerging issues. The FAA's
analysis of this data informed its security policies, including the
issuance of FAA information circulars, security directives and emergency
amendments to the industry. Such security directives and emergency
amendments are how the FAA ordered air carriers and/or airports to
undertake certain extraordinary security measures that were needed
immediately above the established base line.

While the staff has not completed its review and analysis as to what the
FAA knew about the threat posed by al Qaeda to civil aviation, including
the potential use of aircraft as weapons, we can say the following.
First, no documentary evidence reviewed by the Commission or testimony
we have received to this point has revealed that any level of the FAA
possessed any credible and specific intelligence indicating that Usama
bin Laden, al Qaeda, al Qaeda affiliates or any other group were
actually plotting to hijack commercial planes in the United States and
use them as weapons of mass destruction.

Second, the threat posed by Usama bin Laden, al Qaeda and al Qaeda
affiliates, including their interest in civil aviation, was well known
to key civil aviation security officials. The potential threat of Middle
Eastern terrorist groups to civil aviation security was acknowledged in
many different official FAA documents. The FAA possessed information
claiming that associates with Usama bin Laden in the 1990s were
interested in hijackings and the use of an aircraft as a weapon.

Third, the potential for terrorist suicide hijacking in the United
States was officially considered by the FAA's Office of Civil Aviation
Security, dating back to at least March 1998. However, in a presentation
the agency made to air carriers and airports in 2000 and early 2001, the
FAA discounted that threat because, quote, "Fortunately we have no
indication that any group is currently thinking in that direction." It
wasn't until well after the 9/11 attacks that the FAA learned of the
Phoenix EC. This was an internal FBI memo written in July of 2001 by an
FBI agent in the Phoenix field office suggesting steps that should be
taken by the Bureau to look more closely at civil aviation education
schools around the country and the use of such programs by individuals
who may be affiliated with terrorist organizations.

Fourth, the FAA was aware prior to September 11th, 2001 of the arrest of
Zacarias Moussaoui in Minnesota, a man arrested by the INS in August of
2001, following reports of suspicious behavior in flight school and the
determination that he had overstayed his visa waiver period. Several key
issues remain regarding what the FAA knew about Moussaoui, when they
knew it, and how they responded to the information supplied by the FBI,
which we are continuing to pursue.

Fifth, the FAA did react to the heightened security threat identified by
the intelligence community during the summer of 2001, including issuing
alerts to air carriers about the potential for terrorist acts against
civil aviation. In July 2001, the FAA alerted the aviation community to
reports of possible near-term terrorist operations, particular in the
Arabian Peninsula and/or Israel. The FAA informed the airports and air
carriers that it had no credible evidence of specific plans to attack
U.S. civil aviation.

The agency said that some of the currently active groups were known to
plan and train for hijackings, and had the capability to construct
sophisticated improvised explosive devices concealed inside luggage and
consumer products. The FAA encouraged all U.S. carriers to exercise
prudence and demonstrate a high degree of alertness. Although civil
aviation security officials testified that the FAA felt blind when it
came to assessing the domestic threat, because of the lack of
intelligence on what was going on in the American homeland as opposed to
overseas, FAA security analysts did perceive an increasing terrorist
threat to the U.S. civil aviation system at home.

FAA documents including agency accounts published in the Federal
Register on July 17th, 2001 expressed the FAA's understanding that
terrorist groups were active in the United States and maintained an
historic interest in targeting aviation, including hijacking. While the
agency was engaged in an effort to pass important new regulations to
improve checkpoint screener performance, implement anti-sabotage
measures and conduct ongoing assessments of the system, no major
increases in anti-hijacking security measures were implemented in
response to the heightened threat levels in the spring and summer of
2001, other than general warnings to the industry to be more vigilant
and cautious.

Sixth, the civil aviation security system in the United States during
the summer of 2001 stood as it had for quite some time, at an
intermediate aviation security alert level, tantamount to a permanent
code yellow. This level and its corresponding security measures was
required when "information indicates that a terrorist group or other
hostile entity with a known capability of attacking civil aviation is
likely to carry out attacks against U.S. targets, or civil disturbances
with a direct impact on civil aviation have begun or are imminent."
Without actionable intelligence information to uncover and interdict a
terrorist plot in the planning stages or prior to the perpetrator
gaining access to the aircraft in the lead-up to September 11, 2001, it
was up to the other layers of aviation security to counter the threat.

We conclude this section with a final observation. The last major
terrorist attack on a U.S. flagged airliner had been with smuggled
explosives in 1988 in the case of Pan Am 103. The famous Bojinka plot,
broken up in Manila in 1995, had principally been a plot to smuggle
explosives on airliners. The Commission on Aviation Safety and Security,
created by President Clinton in 1996, named the Gore Commission for its
chairman, the Vice President, had focused overwhelmingly on the danger
of explosives on aircraft. Historically, explosives on aircraft had
taken a heavy death toll, hijackings had not. So despite continued
foreign hijackings leading up to 9/11, the U.S. aviation security system
worried most about explosives.

After intelligence the next level is pre-screening. If intelligence
fails to interdict the terrorist threat, passenger pre-screening is the
next layer of defense. Passenger pre-screening encompasses measures
applied prior to the passenger's arrival at the security checkpoint.
Pre-screening starts with the ticketing process and generally concluded
with passenger check-in at the airport ticket counter. The hijackers
purchased their tickets for the 9/11 flights in a short period of time
at the end of August 2001, using credit cards, debit cards or cash.

The ticket record provided the FAA and the air carrier with passenger
information for the pre-screening process.

The first major pre-screening element in place on 9/11 was the FAA
listing of individuals known to pose a threat to commercial aviation.
Based on information provided by the intelligence community, the FAA
required air carriers to prohibited listed individuals from boarding
aircraft, or in designated cases, to assure that the passenger received
enhanced screening before boarding. None of the names of the 9/11
hijackers were identified by the FAA to the airlines in order to bar
them from flying or subject them to extra security measures. In fact,
the number of individuals subject to such security instructions issued
by the FAA was less than 20 people, compared to the tens of thousands of
names identified in the State Department's TIPOFF watchlist, which the
Commission discussed yesterday.

The second component of pre-screening was a program to identify those
passengers on each flight who may pose a threat to aviation. In 1998,
the FAA required air carriers to implement an FAA-approved computer
assisted passenger pre-screening program known as CAPPS, designed to
identify the pool of passengers most likely in need of additional
security scrutiny. The program employed customized FAA approved criteria
derived from a limited set of information about each ticketed passengers
in order to identify selectees.

FAA rules require that the air carrier only screen each selectee's
checked baggage for explosives using various approved methods. However,
under the system in place on 9/11, selectees, those who were regarded as
a risk to the aircraft, were not required to undergo any additional
screening of their person or carry-on baggage at the checkpoint. The
consequences of selection reflected FAA's view that non-suicide bombing
was the most substantial risk to domestic aircraft.

Since the system in place on 9/11 confined the consequences of selection
to the screening of checked bags for explosives, the application of
CAPPS did not provide any defense against the weapons and tactics
employed by the 9/11 hijackers. On American Airlines Flight 11, CAPPS
chose three of the five hijackers as selectees. Since Waleed al Shehri
checked no bags, his selection had no consequences. Waleed al Shehri and
Satam al Suqami had their checked bags scanned for explosives before
they were loaded onto the plane. None of the Flight 175 hijackers were
selected by CAPPS.

All five of the American Airlines Flight 77 hijackers were selected for
security scrutiny. Hani Hanjour, Khalid al Mihdhar and Majed Moqed were
chosen via the CAPPS criteria, while Nawaf al Hazmi and Salem al Hazmi
were made selectees because they provided inadequate identification
information. Their bags were held until it was confirmed that they had
boarded the aircraft. Thus for hijacker selectees Hani Hanjour, Nawaf al
Hazmi and Khalid al Mihdhar, who checked no bags on September 11th,
there were no consequences for their selection by the CAPPS system.

For Salem al Hazmi, who checked two bags, and Majed Moqed who checked
one bag, the sole consequence was that their baggage was held until
after their boarding on Flight 77 was confirmed. Ahmad al Haznawi was
the sole CAPPS selectee among the Flight 93 hijackers. He checked his
bag, was screened for explosives, and then loaded the plane.

I'd now like to turn it over to my colleague, Bill Johnstone.

MR. BILL JOHNSTONE: Next we come to checkpoint screening. With respect
to checkpoint screening, federal rules required the air carriers to
conduct screening to prevent or deter the carriage aboard airplanes of
any explosive, incendiary, or a deadly or dangerous weapon on or about
each individual's person or accessible property, and the carriage of any
explosive or incendiary in checked baggage.

Passenger checkpoint screening is the most obvious element of aviation
security. At the checkpoint, metal detectors were calibrated to detect
guns and large knives. Government-certified X-ray machines capable of
imaging the shapes of items, possessing a particular level of acuity
were used to screen carry-on items. In most instances, these screening
operations were conducted by security companies under contract with the
responsible air carrier.

As of 2001, any confidence that checkpoint screening was operating
effectively was belied by numerous publicized studies by the General
Accounting Office, the Department of Transportation, the Office of the
Inspector General. Over the previous 20 years, they had documented
repeatedly serious chronic weaknesses in the systems deployed to screen
passengers and baggage for weapons and bombs. Shortcomings with the
screening process had also been identified internally by the FAA's own
assessment process.

Despite these documented shortcomings of the screening system, the fact
that neither a hijacking nor a bombing had occurred domestically in over
a decade was perceived by many within the system as confirmation that it
was working. This explains in part the view of one Transportation
Security official who testified to the Commission that the agency
thought that it had won the battle against hijacking. In fact, the
Commission received testimony that one of the primary reasons that the
CAPPS consequences were restricted was because officials thought that
checkpoint screening was working.

The evolution of checkpoint screening illustrates many of the systemic
problems that faced the civil aviation security system in place on 9/11.
The executive and legislative branches of government and the civil
aviation industry were highly reactive on aviation security matters.
Most of the aviation security systems features had developed in response
to specific incidents rather than anticipation. Civil aviation security
was primarily accomplished through a slow and cumbersome rule-making
process, a reflection of the agency's conflicting missions of both
regulating and promoting the industry.

A number of FAA witnesses told the Commission that this rule-making
process was the bane of civil aviation security. For example, the FAA
had attempted to set up a requirement that it would certify screening
contractors. The FAA re-authorization of 1996, in fact, had directed the
FAA to take such action. The 1997 Gore Commission endorsed it but the
process of implementing screener certification had still not been
completed by September 11th, 2001.

Those are systemic observations, but to analyze the 9/11 attack, we had
to focus on which items were prohibited and which were allowed to be
carried into the cabin of an aircraft as of that date. FAA guidelines
were used to determine what objects should not be allowed into the cabin
of an aircraft. And I stress again that this is the system that was in
place on 9/11, not the system that is in place today. Included in the
listing of items not allowed into the cabin of an aircraft were knives
with blades four inches long or longer and/or knives considered illegal
by local law as well as tear gas, mace and similar chemicals.

These guidelines, developed by FAA, were to be used by screeners to make
a reasonable determination of what items in the possession of a person
should be considered a deadly or dangerous weapon. The FAA in
implementing it told the air carriers that common sense should prevail.
Hence the standards that constituted a deadly or dangerous weapon were
somewhat vague. Other than for guns, large knives, explosives and
incendiaries, determining what was allowable was up to the common sense
of the carriers and their screening contractors.

To write out what common sense meant to them, the air carriers
developed, through their trade associations, a checkpoint operations
guide. This document was approved by the FAA. The edition of the guide
in place on September 11th, 2001, for example, classified box cutters as
restricted items which were those that were not to be permitted in the
passenger cabin of an aircraft. In those cases, the checkpoint
supervisor was required to be notified if a box cutter as an item in
that category was encountered by a screener.

Passengers would be given the option of having the box cutter or similar
items transported as checked baggage. Mace, pepper spray and tear gas
were categorized in the operations guide as hazardous materials and
passengers were not allowed to take items in this category onto an
airplane without the express permission of the airline. On the other
hand, pocket utility knives which were defined as those with less than a
4-inch blade were expressly allowed onto the aircraft.

The checkpoint operations guide provided no further guidance on how to
distinguish between box cutters and pocket utility knives. One of the
checkpoint supervisors working at Logan International Airport on
September 11th, 2001 recalled that it was her understanding as of that
day that while box cutters were not permitted to pass through the
checkpoint without the removal of the blade, any knife with a blade of
less than four inches was permitted to pass through security.

In practice, we believe the FAA's approach of admonishing air carriers
to use common sense about what items should not be allowed on an
aircraft or also approving the air carriers' checkpoint operation
guidelines that define the industry's common sense, in practice, created
an environment where both parties could deny responsibility for making
choices that were in the tenor of the times likely to be hard and most
likely unpopular.

What happened at the checkpoints on 9/11 under these guidelines? Of the
checkpoints used to screen the passengers on Flights 11, 77, 93 and 175
on September 11th, only Washington Dulles International Airport had
videotaping equipment in place. Therefore, the most specific information
that exists about the processing of the 9/11 hijackers is information
about American Airlines Flight 77, which crashed into the Pentagon. The
staff has reviewed those videotapes as well as testing results for all
of the checkpoints in question and have reviewed scores of interviews
with checkpoint screeners and supervisors who might have processed the
9/11 hijackers on that day and reviewed FAA and FBI evaluations of all
available information about the 9/11 screening. From what we have seen
to date, there is no reason to believe that the screening on 9/11 was
fundamentally different at any of the relevant airports.

We turn again to the perspective of the enemy. The plan required all of
the hijackers to successfully board the besieged aircraft -- I'm sorry,
the assigned aircraft. If several of their number failed to board, their
operational plan would fall apart or their operational security might be
breached. To have this kind of confidence that had they developed a plan
they felt would work anywhere they were screened regardless of the
quality of the individual screener. We believe they developed such a
plan and practiced in the months before the attacks, including in test
flights to be sure their tactics would work. In other words, we believe
the hijackers did not count on a sloppy screener. All 19 hijackers were
able to pass successfully through checkpoint screening to board their
flights. They were 19 for 19, 100 percent. They counted on beating a
weak system.

Turning to the specifics of Flight 77 checkpoint screening, at 7:18 a.m.
Eastern Daylight Time on the morning of September 11th, 2001, Majed
Moqed and Khalid al Mihdhar entered one of the security screening
checkpoints at Dulles International Airport. They placed their carry-on
bags on the X-ray machine belt and proceeded through the first
magnetometer. Both set off the alarm and were subsequently directed to a
second magnetometer at Dulles. While al Mihdhar did not alarm the second
magnetometer and was permitted through the checkpoint, Moqed failed once
more and was then subjected to a personal screening with a metal
detection hand wand. He passed this inspection and then was permitted to
pass through the checkpoint.

At 7:35 a.m. that morning, Hani Hanjour, believed to be the pilot of the
727, placed two carry-on bags on the X-ray belt at the checkpoint and
proceeded without alarm through the magnetometer. He picked up his
carry-on bags and passed through the checkpoint. One minute later, Nawaf
and Salem al Hazmi entered the same checkpoint. Salem al Hazmi
successfully cleared the magnetometer and was permitted through the
checkpoint. Nawaf al Hazmi set off the alarms for both the first and
second magnetometers and he then also was hand-wanded before being
passed. In addition, his shoulder strap carry-on bag was swiped by an
explosive trace detector and then passed and he too was admitted through
the checkpoint.

Our best working hypothesis is that a number of the hijackers were
carrying -- permissible under the regulations in place at the time --
permissible utility knives or pocket knives. One example of such a
utility knife is displayed by Mr. Brinkley here, this so-called
Leatherman item. We know that at least two knives like this were
actually purchased by the hijackers and have not been found in the
belongings the hijackers left behind. We are passing this around now.
Please be careful, the blade is open. It locks into position. It is very
sharp.

According to the guidelines as we understand them that existed on 9/11,
if such a knife were discovered in the possession of an individual who
alarmed either the walk through metal detector or the hand wand, the
item would be returned to the owner and permitted to be carried on the
aircraft. Once the hijackers were able to get through the checkpoints
and board the plane, the last layer of defense was on board security.
That layer was comprised of two main elements on 9/11, the presence of
law enforcement on the flights and the so called Common Strategy for
responding to in-flight security emergencies, including hijacking, which
had been devised by the FAA in consultation with industry and law
enforcement officials.

However, on the day of September 11th, 2001, after the hijackers
boarded, they faced no remaining significant security obstacles. The
Federal Air Marshal program was almost exclusively directed as of that
date to international flights. Cockpit doors were not hardened and
gaining access to the cockpit was not a particularly difficult
challenge. Flight crews were trained not to attempt to thwart or fight
the hijackers. The object was to get the plane to land safely. Crews
were trained in fact to dissuade passengers from taking precipitous or
heroic actions against hijackers. We'll have more to say about the
Common Strategy in the staff statement that will come later today.

Philip.

MR. ZELIKOW: In conclusion, from all of the evidence the staff has
reviewed to date, we have come to the conclusion that, on September 11,
2001, would-be hijackers of domestic flights of

U.S. civil aviation faced these challenges: avoiding prior notice by the
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement communities; carrying items that
could be used as weapons that were either permissible or not detectable
by the screening systems in place; and understanding and taking
advantage of the in-flight hijacking protocol of the Common Strategy.

A review of publicly available literature and/or the use of test runs
would likely have improved the odds of achieving those tasks. The no fly
list offered an opportunity to stop the hijackers, but the FAA had not
been provided any of their names, even though two of them were already
watchlisted in TIPOFF. The pre-screening process was effectively
irrelevant to them. The on-board security efforts like the Federal Air
Marshal program had eroded to the vanishing point.

So the hijackers really had to beat just one layer of security, the
security checkpoint process. Plotters who were determined, highly
motivated individuals, who escaped notice on no-fly lists, who studied
publicly available vulnerabilities of the aviation security system, who
used items with a metal content less than a handgun and most likely
permissible, and who knew how to exploit training received by aircraft
personnel to be non-confrontational were likely to be successful in
hijacking a domestic U.S. aircraft.

MR. KEAN: Thank you very much.

I'd now like our first panel please to take their seats. For our first
panel, our first witness will be Ms. Jane Garvey. Ms. Garvey was
administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration on September 11th,
2001. She first assumed that post in 1997. Ms. Garvey previously
testified before this commission last May and we certainly appreciate
the fact she has come back to join us again.

Following Ms. Garvey will be Rear Admiral Cathal "Irish" Flynn. Admiral
Flynn served as head of the FAA Security Division from 1993 through the
end of 2000. His successor in that position, Lieutenant Mike Canavan
also testified at our May 2003 hearings. Welcome to Admiral Flynn.

Finally, we'll hear from the former head of FAA's Intelligence Division,
Claudio Manno. Mr. Manno was in that capacity on 9/11 and he currently
has a similar role at the Transportation Security Administration where
he is deputy to the associate administrator for Intelligence. Thank you,
Mr. Manno, for taking time away from your important current duties to be
with us today.

Would you please stand and raise your right hand? Do you swear or affirm
to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Thank you
very much.

(Witnesses sworn.)

Ms. Garvey.

MS. JANE F. GARVEY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the
Commission.

Good morning. I have submitted to the Commission for inclusion in the
record a written testimony supplementing my previous testimony on May
22nd, 2003. I hope my participation here will contribute to the
recommendation which, in the Chairman's words, will assist the
Commission in doing everything it can to make the American people safer.
Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge the many families and the
friends of those who were killed or injured on September 11th. Their
suffering is unimaginable and perhaps more than any other single group
of Americans, they have a vested interest in the Commission
accomplishing its mandate.

Let me address one area that has been the subject of both prior
questioning and testimony by several witnesses, specifically the
pre-September 11th relationship among the airlines, the airports and the
Federal Aviation Administration. In 2001, it was these three entities
that, by statute, shared responsibility for civil aviation security in
the United States. Air carriers had primary responsibility for screening
passengers and baggage and for applying security measures to everything
that went into their planes. Airports were responsible for maintaining a
secure ground environment and providing local law enforcement support.
Government's role, the FAA's role, was regulatory.

Within the regulatory framework established by Congress, the FAA set
security standards for 424 airports, for United States airlines
worldwide, and for foreign air carriers flying to the United States from
approximately 250 foreign airports. This division of responsibility
among the airports, the airlines and the FAA was, in large measure, a
reflection of the fact that the airports owned the land and were best
able to provide local law enforcement. The airlines operated the
aircraft and were in the best position to manage passenger and cargo,
and government had the regulatory authority.

The priorities of the FAA were safety, security and the capacity of the
air traffic control system. Specific targets, specific objectives were
established in each area and progress towards those objectives was
monitored continually. Given the dynamic nature of the aviation system,
those objectives were also subject to ongoing evaluation and
modification.

In the months preceding September 11th, while greater public attention
was focused on aviation delays and the passenger bill of rights,
internally the agency was very much focused on safety and security. On
September 10th, 2001, aviation security in this country was on a
peacetime footing. The FAA had worked hard to make changes in the
aviation security baseline, changes supported by specific credible
threat information and analysis. The Office of Civil Aviation Security,
based on information received from the intelligence communities, had the
primary responsibility of assessing the threat to civil aviation.

As this work was underway, daily evaluation of the system and assessment
of incoming intelligence information led the FAA to issue security
directives and information circulars to address developments and
threats. Prior to September 11th, 2001, we had a security system based
on certain assumptions. These included the fact that politically
motivated hijackers would release passengers after landing at a safe
haven, and that together with such hijackings, explosives presented the
greatest threat to the system. The events of September 11th certainly
challenged those assumptions. A system which had proven effective for
the preceding 10 years could no longer be relied upon.

In the summer of 2001, while there was a growing concern regarding a
domestic threat, the FAA did not have any credible or any specific
information which indicated the type of attack we saw on September 11th
was planned or even possible within the United States. The greater
concern regarding a threat was internationally.

Admiral Loy, deputy secretary of Homeland Security, in his testimony
will describe a broad range of activities in which the Transportation
Security Administration is engaged. It's building on many of the
components of the aviation security system established by the FAA:
CAPPS, the layered approach to security, intelligence assessments,
testing, research and development, but perhaps most importantly,
redirecting them to a changed threat.

The world has changed in its entirety since September 11th. We are a
nation at war, a war which has crossed our borders and entered our
cities. Americans have long known that eternal vigilance is the price of
liberty. Now we know that in the age of uncertainty, it is the price of
mobility.

Thank you, and I'd be happy to answer any of your questions, Mr.
Chairman.

MR. KEAN: Thank you very much.

Mr. Flynn.

MR. CATHAL L. "IRISH" FLYNN: Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, I
-- and the staff -- have had a long interview, and I have submitted a
written statement. I don't have a verbal statement to make now, but if
you don't mind, there are three or four items in the statement that I
just heard from the staff that I think might be worthwhile for me to
comment on.

The paragraph that said before, September 11th, 2001, the aviation
system had been enjoying a period of relative peace. That isn't quite
so. We'd had a very serious threat against aviation in the Pacific. We
had numerous indications of -- and actual hard intelligence to which we
reacted and imposed additional measures at stations overseas -- with
regard to several vectors of attack. And, of course, even though TWA 800
turned out not to be a bomb, it was a -- there was a considerable period
where that was a major concern.

So to the extent that that paragraph might indicate that we had been
lulled into any sense of complacency, that is certainly not the case for
FAA and FAA security. Then the paragraph at the end said that -- at the
end of the first page talks about our efforts to complete a five-year
process to bring in a rule for -it was actually the rule to certify
screening companies. And it does give the impression that that
rule-making was the only thing that we were doing, and that's far from
the case. Rule-making was important but it's far from the only thing
that we were doing.

With regard to rings and layers, I think it's a mistake to look upon the
set of rings that begin at the airport as being the only rings that
apply to protecting the aircraft and all who fly on them, and indeed to
protecting people in the airport. It is important that there be
interaction between those rings and the further outer rings or layers of
our national security system. And one of the items of that from a
strategic sense is to make the defense of any of our installations, and
in the case of civil aviation to make the aircraft and the people -- to
have defenses there that will require the attackers to do extraordinary
things that would then come to the attention of the intelligence and law
enforcement authority in the outer layers.

Then there's a further statement that we were reactive. Well, we haven't
had a bomb in cargo and we haven't had an attack by surface-to-air
missiles, and we have measures with regard to cargo and a program with
regard to cargo and we're working -- and indeed in the case of a
specific threat overseas, work with the airlines and the nations
concerned and with the National Security Council staff in order to put
in and develop a range of things that we would do in certain
circumstances. I hasten to say that a lot of those circumstances would
have -- circumstance would have required cancellation of the flights.
But it isn't that we had to wait for something to happen -- and indeed
there are more difficult things to deal with to which we are paying
attention, for example, the introduction of nerve agent gas onto an
aircraft.

With regard to CAPPS, I hope that there will be questions about it
because its role -- I think I would like to say some things about its
function.

Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Mr. Manno.

MR. CLAUDIO MANNO: Chairman Kean, Vice Chairman Hamilton and commission
members, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in your inquiry
into the facts and circumstances surrounding the September 11th, 2001
terrorist attacks against the United States. My written statement
addresses the questions posed in your letter of invitation and I would
respectfully request that it be entered into the record. This morning I
will summarize some of the key points about how the FAA Office of
Intelligence received, assessed and disseminated intelligence prior to
the fall of 2001 and also highlight some of the process improvements.

Before beginning, however, I would like to express my deepest sympathies
to the families, friends and co-workers of those who perished on
September 11th, 2001. As a tribute to them, a wreath hangs on the door
of our intelligence watch as a silent reminder of the importance of our
mission in keeping the nation's transportation infrastructure and its
travelers secure.

On September 11th, 2001, I was a director of the Office of Intelligence,
which was part of the Civil Aviation Security Organization of the FAA.
The office was tasked with identification, analysis and dissemination of
intelligence information focusing on terrorism and other threats to U.S.
civil aviation. Although the magnitude of the events of September 11th,
2001 had not previously been seen, FAA's 24-hour intelligence watch had
managed multiple crises prior to the tragic suicide hijackings. The
expertise of our analysts and a well-established set of standard
operating procedures enabled the office to quickly realign and provide
extended round the clock coverage of the incident and its aftermath.
This cadre of analysts, although small, worked feverishly to provide
senior FAA and DOT decision makers with an immediate assessment of the
events and possible additional near-term threats.

As a consumer of intelligence, FAA identified its information needs in
detailed statements of intelligence interest to those agencies
responsible for producing most of the intelligence on terrorism, namely
CIA, the Department of State, FBI, NSA and the Defense Intelligence
Agency. The newly created Terrorist Threat Integration Center now plays
a role in that effort. FAA received a daily stream of threat reporting
and finished intelligence from these agencies and identified on average
100 to 200 classified reports each day that merited closer review.

To enhance access to relevant intelligence reporting, FAA assigned
liaison officers to CIA, FBI and State Department. Their primary duties
were to identify and pursue information regarding actual or potential
threats to civil aviation. Occasionally, they would review information
that provided insight about a terrorist threat or incident, but may not
have been disseminated to the FAA. In these cases, the liaison officers
requested release of the information and would educate the agencies as
to why such information was of importance to the FAA. In some cases,
they were successful in getting release for FAA. In other situations,
due to the sensitivity of sources and methods, the information was not
approved for release.

When analysts working in the 24-hour intelligence watch identified
current or future threats to aviation, a preliminary evaluation of its
validity was made in coordination with the originator and other relevant
agencies. FAA intelligence analysts examined the plausibility of the
information based on their expertise regarding the known intent and
capability of the alleged hijackers, the method of attack, as well as a
characterization of the reliability of the source made by the agency
supplying the information. The characterization of the source is a
significant factor as decision-makers depend on threat assessments based
on credible information from reliable sources.

Once a report was identified as an actual or potential threat, FAA
analysts opened an intelligence case file, an ICF, to isolate and follow
up on the threat to its logical conclusion, adding any new information
to either validate or discount the threat. And there were several
hundred of these ICFs that were opened at any one time and that we were
working on. FAA analysts prepared threat assessments based on analyses
of these reports and coordinated these assessments with FBI and CIA to
ensure factual accuracy and analytic logic.

Intelligence is only useful, however, if it reaches the operators and
policymakers in an actionable format and timely manner. Prior to
September 11th, 2001, FAA intelligence analysts worked closely with
specialists in the offices of civil aviation security operations and
aviation policy who view the intelligence information against the
vulnerability of the target in an attempt to establish the level of risk
of a successful attack. These offices promulgated security
countermeasures to reduce the level of risk as appropriate. This threat
and risk assessment process was applied to both current and strategic
threats and was used to determine the long-term baseline aviation
security posture for a region or a country.

Potential aviation threat information was communicated to those that
needed it at the operational level primarily through the preparation and
issuance of information circulars which alerted recipients to possible
threats and security directives which required air carriers and airports
to implement specific security measures to counter a threat. Regulated
entities, such as the air carriers and airports, received the notices
directly from FAA while airport law enforcement elements had access to
them through the Airport Law Enforcement Agencies Network. When
declassification of information was not possible, the 24-hour
intelligence watch verbally alerted cleared aviation security
representatives to threats or events that were of a potential interest
through secure telephone calls.

Now that I have explained how the FAA received and processed threat
information prior to the events of 2001, I would like to highlight
intelligence support that the FAA Office of Intelligence provided to the
transportation industry stakeholders and other government agencies as it
transitioned to TSA. Prior to September 11th, the FAA had published
security directives that required air carriers not to transport certain
individuals that were known or suspected threats to aviation security.
Immediately following September 11th, the FAA began to administer a
watchlist for the FBI as part of the investigation of the hijackings. By
the end of 2001, the FAA had assumed responsibility for this watchlist
which now includes individuals known to pose, or suspected of posing, a
threat to aviation or national security. This mechanism enables the
notification of law enforcement and the application of defensive
measures.

We also stood up a new division with analysts whose primary duty was to
provide support to the Federal Air Marshal Service. Also, the Aviation
and Transportation Security Act of November 2001 tasked TSA to receive,
assess and distribute intelligence information related to transportation
security. Thus, the new Transportation Security Intelligence Service
became responsible for assessing threats to all modes of transportation:
aviation, maritime and land, and now provides threat warning products to
stakeholders in all modes of transportation.

As a result of the steps taken to improve operations in the aftermath of
September 11th, 2001 attacks, the TSIS, the successor to the FAA's
Office of Intelligence now enjoys increased access to intelligence and
law enforcement information which has undoubtedly had a positive impact
on the security of

U.S. transportation assets both in the homeland and abroad. More
information is being shared among more agencies than ever before thus
improving situational awareness of potential threats to U.S.
transportation assets in the U.S. and abroad.

I would like to provide briefly some additional granularity on some of
the beneficial developments and a word or two regarding the areas that
we are continuing to seek improvement. Regarding intelligence from the
FBI, prior to September 11th, 2001, FAA did not receive a daily flow of
raw reports and finished intelligence from the FBI. The Bureau did not
consider itself an intelligence production agency, perhaps because of
the statutory restrictions on the dissemination of information it
collected in its investigative role.

Recently, however, the flow of reporting from FBI has significantly
increased. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 amended previous laws that had
prevented the FBI from sharing grand jury and Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act information, FISA information. The creation of the
National Joint Terrorism Task Force, the NJTTF, has also expanded the
flow of information from the FBI. TSIS has assigned a full-time liaison
officer to the NJTTF in recognition of the value of tapping into the
information reported up from local JTFs throughout the country. TSIS's
NJTTF's representatives also provide operational information that
supports FBI operations and investigations.

Regarding information sharing and coordination among agencies, TSIS
receives a copy of the daily matrix that highlights current critical
threats to U.S. interests. Agencies also more frequently coordinate
finished intelligence products and CIA, TTIC and FBI more routinely
solicit input and comment from TSA on threat assessments. To build on a
new spirit of sharing and coordination, TSIS has assigned liaison
officers to TTIC and to NSA.

The consolidation of TSA, Customs and Immigration within the Department
of Homeland Security has also led to enhanced information sharing and
coordination of not only intelligence but operations as well. TSIS has
also contributed to the stand-up of the TSC, which as you know, was
created to provide information on known or suspected terrorists from
various U.S. government databases to federal screening operations,
border patrol and state and local law enforcement. Two TSIS intelligence
analysts provide direct support to the TSC leadership on matters
regarding the TSA Watchlist program.

The intelligence and law enforcement communities have always provided
TSA with reporting regarding specific threats and since late 2001, there
has been a sizeable increase in the volume of intelligence reporting
being disseminated to TSA. Nevertheless, more information about
terrorist infrastructures both in the United States and abroad would
assist TSIS intelligence analysts in forecasting potential threats in
areas where U.S. transportation assets are located or provide service.
Such information would allow TSIS to provide better situational
awareness to TSA executives, field operators and industry stakeholders.

Despite some remaining obstacles, the intelligence and law enforcement
communities have made great strides in information sharing and
coordination since the tragic events of September 11th, 2001. TSIS will
continue to review our analytic skill sets and dissemination mechanisms,
improving them where possible and will remain focused on providing TSA
and DHS executives, operators and industry stakeholders with an accurate
assessment of current and future threats to the U.S. infrastructure.

Chairman Kean, Vice Chairman Hamilton and members of the Commission, I
recognize the importance of your task on behalf of the American people
and appreciate the opportunity to participate in these proceedings. I
would be happy to address any questions that you may have for me.

Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Thank you very much, sir.

As we start the questioning, I might remind people that yesterday and
today we are looking at the system's vulnerabilities as they existed on
9/11. We are not talking about present vulnerabilities. We've got to
communicate our views about those vulnerabilities perhaps in our public
report or certainly through the appropriate channels.

The questioning will be lead by Senator Gorton.

MR. SLADE GORTON: First, for Ms. Garvey and for Mr. Manno, knowing that
you're fully aware of your oath, our first question is, to your
knowledge, did the FAA possess any information regarding a terrorist
plot to hijack aircraft and to use them as weapons and targets in the
United States, or any other plot that resembled such an operation prior
to 9/11?

MS. GARVEY: Commissioner, in my knowledge, from my perspective, we had
no knowledge of that.

MR. GORTON: Mr. Manno?

MR. MANNO: No specific knowledge. Certainly not in the way that the
events were carried out on 9/11.

MR. GORTON: Ms. Garvey, as you know, we had a long relationship between
1997 and the year 2000 when I was chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on
Aviation and you headed the FAA. There were a significant number of
hearings during that period of time. Would you characterize those
hearings as primarily related to competitive issues to airport capacity,
you know, slots and landing slots and rights and the like to aircraft
safety from the point of view of the rules that you adopted with respect
to aircraft safety, and to the extent that they dealt with security
exclusively or almost exclusively on the subject of explosives on
aircraft?

MS. GARVEY: Commissioner, I think that's a fair characterization. I
would add one caveat, and that is the economic issues really was the
domain of the Department of Transportation. But certainly capacity,
explosives, safety issues, those were FAA and certainly had a number of
hearings.

MR. GORTON: Demands for a passengers' bill of rights, for example.

MS. GARVEY: That's correct. That, of course, would have been more DOT as
well.

MR. GORTON: And those subjects were also the primary subjects of the
Gore Commission, whose recommendations set many of the boundaries for
concerns during the years at least that I was there, up until the year
2000. Is that not correct?

MS. GARVEY: I would agree with that assessment, Commissioner, yes.

MR. GORTON: Is it fair to say with respect to security issues as well as
to -- security issues. Is it fair to say that there were more pressures
on the Federal Aviation Administration to relax security measures during
that period than there were to strengthen them?

MS. GARVEY: I'm not sure I would fully characterize it that way. If
you're asking me, was I aware that industry or others, for example, had
concerns about some of the security measures, absolutely. We certainly -

MR. GORTON: That's exactly my question.

MS. GARVEY: We certainly heard it through the rule-making process. We
certainly heard it in public meetings that were held. You know, I do
want to go back, though, to a point I made in my opening statement, and
that is while the public and certainly Congress as well was very focused
on the capacity issues, which were very real at the time in 2000 and
2001, we still had a security office with very experienced, very
well-trained professionals who were focused on those issues as well.

MR. GORTON: But outside pressures on you and your office were primarily
focused on those other subjects, were they not?

MS. GARVEY: That is correct, Commissioner.

MR. GORTON: One example of these security matters, you saw the knife
that was circulated during the course of your testimony, which now at
least we all can draw a breath at how lethal it was. Can you say why it
was that a knife of that size and potency was universally considered to
be something which could regularly be carried onto aircraft? Was there a
great deal of pressure, for example, that anyone should be able to take
a Swiss Army knife with him or with her on an aircraft? Were any of the
rules -- were any of the suggestions in this five-year rule-making that
had not been completed directed at weapons of that nature?

MS. GARVEY: I don't remember that discussion when I was the
administrator. I can give you a little bit of perspective, at least from
my perspective. As you indicated, that policy was in place on 9/11. It
was a policy that had been in place, that is prohibiting knives larger
than 4 inches. It is a policy that it's my understanding had been in my
place since the 1970s.

But, again, if you go back to 9/11 and you think about the atmosphere in
an airport, there were -- knives were very commonplace. Knives were used
as part of the meal service in the airlines. If you were to stop at a
security -- or a souvenir shop, even beyond the secure area, it is
possible that you could purchase, say, a pocketknife and so forth. And
from the security intelligence experts, from the law enforcement people,
the greater threats -- as has been indicated even by the staff report,
the greater threats were from larger, more lethal weapons and from
explosives.

Clearly with the benefit of hindsight, as you pointed out, we have a
different view. I do think it is important to remind ourselves, as the
staff statement reminded us, that we are and were dealing with an
incredibly intelligent, well-trained, disciplined terrorists who may
have used any other number of common household items as a lethal weapon
as well. MR. GORTON: And who just flat out beat us. MS. GARVEY: That's
right, Commissioner. MR. GORTON: At our May hearing, you testified, and
I quote,

that, "Perhaps the greatest lesson of September 11th is that the
terrorist threat is just as real here at home as it is for our embassies
in East Africa, a Naval destroyer in Yemen or the Marine barracks in
Beirut," end quote. At least in retrospect, should not that have been
the lesson of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing?

MS. GARVEY: You know, I think with the clarity of hindsight you can look
at a number of those facts and come to those conclusions. And again, I
do want to go back to a point that has been made earlier. There was a
growing domestic concern and I think that was reflected in some of the
intelligence circulars, some of the SDs that the FAA issued. So there
was a growing concern. But I think the greatest thrust, the greater
concern was still international. Should we have learned more from the
World Trade Center? Boy, again, I think with the clarity of hindsight
there, there are certainly questions there.

MR. GORTON: With respect to intelligence, and Mr. Manno can comment on
this question as well, explain to us how it was that you had a no-fly
directive that applied to only 20 or so people, while there was a
terrorist -- a TIPOFF list that included hundreds or thousands of
people? Were you, Ms. Garvey, aware that there was such a TIPOFF list?

Mr. Manno, did your section have that list available to it? Did it even
know that it existed? And if you did know that it existed and had it
available, why weren't those names on a no-fly list?

MR. MANNO: I think I can answer that by explaining the way that the
process worked. As I indicated earlier, the way that we received
intelligence or information from the intelligence community was by
identifying our statement of intelligence needs. Based on that, the
intelligence community provided us information that was relevant to
aviation security. So based on the information we received, our analysts
reviewed it and in the case where there was specific and credible
information that people were actually targeting, making plans to target
civil aviation, if we had identifying data, they were put on a security
directive which directed the air carriers not to transport these people.

MR. GORTON: All right, but neither of you have answered my question. You
know, let's break it down and ask it again. Were either of you aware of
the existence of the TIPOFF roster?

MR. MANNO: Yes.

MR. GORTON: Were you, Ms. Garvey?

MS. GARVEY: I may have been aware. I can't tell you with certainty that
I was aware pre-9/11 that the list -

MR. GORTON: Well, were the names on that list then available to you and
not requested? Or available to you and discarded as not important?

MS. GARVEY: Commissioner, if I could -- I'll give you my perspective and
then turn it over to Mr. Manno. But from my perspective, the names that
I saw, and we'd see them in the security directive, they would be
included in the security directive. From my perspective, those names
were the names that the intelligence community believed had some
implication with aviation. So, for example, while other intelligence
agencies may have had other names, those names pre-9/11 if they did not
have a specific aviation -

MR. GORTON: I -- you know, I fully understand that, but my question
still is were those names not supplied to you, and I guess this is for
Mr. Manno, or were they supplied to you and discarded as not having a
relationship with aircraft?

MR. MANNO: TIPOFF at that time included about 61,000 names. We had
access to TIPOFF, but the way that it worked is if you had a name, you
had to have a name, you could then go against TIPOFF and do a search and
it would provide you information. But the way that the system worked at
the time, unless we received the intelligence reporting that identified
to us names of interest and then to go into TIPOFF and search against
that, it was not -- it was simply not used that way. So TIPOFF was
there, TIPOFF was available, TIPOFF was 61,000 names that included
information not only of, you know, terrorists involved in all sorts of
things and others -

MR. LEHMAN: It was perfectly all right to have them fly because they
were terrorists in other things, there was no reason to put them on your
watchlist, right? I mean, I don't understand the logic of this.

MR. MANNO: Well, the way that the process worked with the security
directive is names were identified to an airline who then bumped those
up against their reservation list to determine if somebody was actually
going to fly.

MR. GORTON: Yeah, that's right, but you only had 20 names that fell into
that category and there were thousands of names on a TIPOFF list, all of
whom were suspected terrorists. And so I gather the decision at some
place or another was that a suspected terrorist who had not specifically
been linked to aircraft was okay to fly?

MR. MANNO: The names -- including the 20 names were names that were
specifically identified to us in intelligence reporting. The process was
for the intelligence reporting to indicate to us those that we ought to
be concerned about.

MR. GORTON: And you made no further inquiry beyond that? You didn't ask
for a list of suspected terrorists?

MR. MANNO: You mean through TIPOFF?

MR. GORTON: Yes.

MR. MANNO: No, we did not go to the State Department and ask them to
give us all 61,000 names so that they could be put on the watchlist. For
one thing, the airlines would not have been able to handle such a list.

MR. GORTON: Well, they weren't given the opportunity, were they?

MR. MANNO: Well, we know that today, sir, because today we are managing
a similar list which is of about 3,500 names which requires the carriers
to check against a reservation system, and they're struggling just even
with those.

MR. JOHN F. LEHMAN: But they sure had no trouble handling their frequent
flyer lists -- I mean that's ridiculous. Your whole testimony is -- it
talks about process. You described to us -- it sounded like an
indoctrination course for your new employees describing the process.
What about common sense?

Didn't anybody ever -- did you ever step back and say, now look, my job
is not to wait until the intelligence community gives me finished
product, but to look at this and say, does it pass the commonsense test?
Does it pass the commonsense test to let young Arabs on with four-inch
blades? Didn't any of you -leadership is about not taking the process
which you hide behind, but about saying this is not sufficient. Of
course they can handle thousands of questionable people. Of course a
young Arab should not be allowed on airplanes with four-inch blades, yet
none of you applied common sense.

MR. GORTON: Secretary Lehman just said that's right, you know. Every
time I fly, every time I make a reservation I get a frequent flyer
credit. The airline has no difficulty in doing that for me, to check my
name against its list every time. I can't see how it has a problem with
3,000 or 60,000 suspected terrorists. But let's leave -- you know, you
answered my first question I think accurately, that as of 9/11 you did
not anticipate or expect, you did not imagine the kind of hijacking that
actually took place with suicide and the killing of many people in mind.
Let's accept that.

But certainly with respect to all of the hijackings that have ever taken
place before, you were anticipating and were working against the kind of
hijacking that went to Havana or that asked for the release of prisoners
and, you know, or the like. And yet you never, either of you and I guess
this would apply to Admiral Flynn as well, decided to have an expanded
no-fly list of suspected terrorists, is that correct?

MR. MANNO: The list at that time was based on specific and credible
information that we had.

MR. GORTON: Other two? Any answer beyond that?

MR. FLYNN: I regret to say that I was unaware of the TIPOFF list and was
unaware of it until yesterday.

MR. GORTON: Now, one other thing. Are you saying you, who are current
today, that there are only 3,500 people on a no-fly list today?

MR. MANNO: There's actually two lists. A selectee and a no-fly list, and
actually the number is greater than that.

MR. GORTON: What is the relationship between the FAA at the present time
and the TIPOFF program?

MR. MANNO: The -- well, as you know TIPOFF has now been rolled into the
TSC process -

MR. GORTON: Okay, and?

MR. MANNO: So the way that the system works is that we obtain
information from that list and people are put on the no-fly list based
again on indications that they pose a threat to aviation.

MR. GORTON: But merely being a suspected terrorist doesn't get you on
that list?

MR. MANNO: Pardon, sir?

MR. GORTON: Merely being a suspected terrorist doesn't get you on that
no-fly list?

MR. MANNO: It can, it depends what group you're associated with and what
other information there is.

MR. GORTON: Wow, I find that to be an incredible answer.

MR. MANNO: As an example, there is a lot of information that came out of
the war on Afghanistan when the camps were discovered there, lists and
things like that and those names, because of their ties to al Qaeda, are
put on our no-fly list.

MR. GORTON: Well, I must say I would strongly suggest that when the
intelligence agencies of the United States have a name that they expect
or suspect to be a terrorist, that that name ought to be on the no-fly
list. And I think, in my view at least, that's a no-brainer.

Back to you, Ms. Garvey. Does the FAA or did the FAA have any kind of
supervision over flight training schools? Obviously to license a pilot
requires a certain degree of education, but is there any monitoring of
the schools at which young men and women receive that flight training?

MS. GARVEY: Commissioner, for the flight schools there are standards and
requirements that a flight school would have to attain in order to get
an FAA certificate, and depending on the level of training they are
providing, those certificates would vary.

MR. GORTON: But that certificate just goes to the school? That just says
you do a competent job.

MS. GARVEY: That's exactly right, Commissioner, that's exactly right.

MR. GORTON: But there's no connection -- the school doesn't have to
report the names of the people who are taking the training or the degree
of training that they've received to you to check against any kind of
license application?

MS. GARVEY: Pre-9/11 there was no vetting of the individual students who
signed up in the schools.

MR. GORTON: Is there now?

MS. GARVEY: Yes there is, Commissioner. Post-9/11 there

\- and as part of a legislation even before that as an emergency action,
there is vetting of the student and an actual verification that the
school must receive and submit to the FAA from the country, from the
student's country.

MR. GORTON: Ms. Garvey, as the administrator, how much of your time did
you spend on security matters? How often were you briefed, for example,
by people like the Admiral or Mr. Manno? How did you get performance
ratings of civil aviation security policies through the airlines and the
airports and the like? What share of your time did it take and what was
your function in connection with it?

MS. GARVEY: Let me divide it, if I could, Commissioner, into two parts.
One is how did I receive the sort of security information, and number
two is how did we monitor sort of the day to day progress being made by
security and I'll start with the second part. Security, like safety and
efficiency, was responsible for establishing goals and objectives, and
in this case it centered very much as has been indicated around some of
the rule-making, some of the explosive detection machines and so forth.
That monitoring and oversight of that really occurred as part of
management board meetings that were held on Monday and Friday.

As to the security information, how did I receive it and so forth? As
Mr. Manno indicated, there were on any given day there could be as high
as 200 intelligence faxes received by the Intelligence Office. I would
certainly not receive every one of those but anything that the
Intelligence Office deemed important would come up to my office. If
there was a particular urgency around an issue or something that the
associate administrator was particularly concerned about that I would
receive that briefing in person, or if I was not in the office at the
time I would receive it perhaps later in the day by the -- from perhaps
the deputy secretary. So I would receive security briefings either
through a written document that would come directly to my office or
through an oral direct briefing from the associate administrator.

MR. GORTON: The staff reported on the checkpoint operations guide that
was developed by the air carriers and approved by you as the head of the
FAA. To your knowledge was there any airline that ever was restless or
objected that that operations guide was too lax and wanted or imposed
itself a more stringent regulations on incoming -- on passengers?

MS. GARVEY: I'm not aware of that, Commissioner.

MR. GORTON: Finally, I think it's someone else's turn here, but the 9/11
families submitted what I consider to be a very important question to us
to which I'd like your answer. How is it that when you went through your
various proceedings dealing with violations of federal law on the part
of airlines and imposed fines that in fact, on average, the fines were
reduced to 10 cents on the dollar? Why is it that when you go through an
entire system and say a fine ought to be so many thousands of dollars
that that just isn't the end of it?

MS. GARVEY: Well, if I could, Commissioner, I'll answer and certainly if
other panel members want to contribute to this. First of all, I'd like
to check the number. I'd heard that before and I've not had an
opportunity -- I'm not sure that number is correct. But I'd like to
check it and I can certainly tell you that from the FAA's perspective,
from my perspective, the civil penalties that we imposed were not as
effective as we wanted them to be. We went back repeatedly to get those
fines raised and they were raised incrementally.

I think we were far more effective when it was levied against
individuals then when it was levied against a company. Frankly, I think
sometimes we found the best way to -- or sort of the best -- the more
effective way was to publicize that and we did that. But there's also
the due process. The inspector or the special agent who first brings the
action forward submits that and there is also, of course, the due
process where the lawyers from -- for either the individual or the
lawyers for the airline goes through the process with the FAA and a
determination is made. I don't know if its 10 cents on the dollar. It
was never as high as we liked.

MR. GORTON: Well, that's a lot of due process to go to 10 cents on a
dollar, and I guess we would appreciate it if you have the ability to do
so, since you question whether or not that figure is accurate, to the
extent of your ability to answer that question more precisely in writing
later, we would very much appreciate it. I think I do have some more
questions, but the red light has been on for some time and it's
Congressman Roemer's turn in this connection.

MR. KEAN: Okay, we'll come back to you.

Congressman Roemer?

MR. TIMOTHY J. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I want to thank the panel and thank Senator Gorton for starting a very
thorough round, a very fair round of questions. I want to start with
just the larger policy question and the security system that we had in
place on September 11, 2001. It just seems to me from a common sense
point of view that in medicine, when a doctor looks at a patient, they
just don't look at one disease. If there's a low probability but high
consequence possibility for that patient, we're going to look at a host
of different scenarios.

The military does the same thing. There may be a low probability but a
high consequence attack. We get ready for it. Sports, the Superbowl
coming up, there may be a low probability that the first play's going to
be the bomb down the field, but there's a defense set up for it. In our
aviation security system, leading up to and on September 11, 2001, it
seems to me there's only one system in place, even though the clues and
the threats are flowing in through this entire decade. Let me briefly
bring up some of the overall policy clues and objectives.

In January '95 a Philippine National Police raid turns up materials in
Manila where there is a proposed plot, among other things, to possibly
crash an airplane into CIA headquarters. In 1998, August, the
intelligence community obtains information that a group of unidentified
Arabs plans to fly an explosive laden plane into a foreign country --
from a foreign country into the World Trade Center. September 1998 the
intelligence community obtains information that Usama bin Laden's next
operation could involve flying aircraft loaded with explosives into a
U.S. airport.

November '98 the intelligence community obtains information that a
Turkish Islamic extremist group has planned a suicide attack, in part
involving a plane and crashing that with explosives into Ataturk's tomb.
The list, March 1999, August 2001, goes on. With respect to what we're
doing here at home to protect our passengers and our planes, here's the
information that we have at the FAA. Here's the internal document,
developed in the summer of 2000, delivered in 2001 prior to 9/11 and
here's a quote from this document that's warning about terrorist
hijackings.

"A domestic hijacking would likely result in a greater number of
American hostages but would be operationally more difficult to
accomplish. We don't rule it out." And it continues, "If, however, the
intent of the hijackers is not to exchange hostages for prisoners but to
commit suicide in a spectacular explosion, a domestic hijacking would
probably be preferable," unquote. Directly to the point of 9/11.

And then finally published in July 17, 2001, the Federal Register,
quote, "Terrorism can occur anytime, anywhere in the United States.
Members of foreign terrorist groups, representatives from state sponsors
of terrorism and radical fundamentalist elements from many nations are
present in the United States. Thus an increasing threat to civil
aviation from both foreign sources and potential domestic ones exist and
needs to be prevented and countered." Needs to be prevented and
countered. So my question is, with all this evidence coming in

\- it's not a specific date, granted, but the dots are connected and
they're large and they're looming and they're big. Why doesn't this
result in a change in terrorism policy at our airports to try to expand
the list of things that we're going to try to go after beyond the
possibility of explosive devices on airplanes?

Mr. Flynn, can you take the first crack at that?

MR. FLYNN: Yeah, if I had to do it again, I would get up over the fierce
amount of activity that was going on with regard to commissions, with
regard to acquisition, certification of equipment, R&D programs, human
factors, inspections, modifications of rules, additions to rules,
working with the intelligence community, working with the NSC, to ask
ourselves, indeed to ask myself: How will they attack us again? I mean,
those things were there and it isn't that we disregarded them. It isn't
that I disregarded them. I didn't see -- there were contra-indications
on a number of them.

For example, the Manila one was perpetrated by people who went to very
considerable extent not to be suicidal in the way that they conducted
their attack. The French one, you didn't mention it, but I spoke to the
French inspector of police from the headquarters of the French police
who came over to brief people in Washington, including me, about it. And
I said, well, what about this business of going after the Eiffel Tower.
And again, there were disconnects. How were they going to do that? How
were they going to coerce pilots to do that? And she said, furthermore,
rather than them wanting to kill everybody on board, there's a strong
indication that Stockholm syndrome was going on at Marseille where the
aircraft was.

Then with regard to the other things of how do you bring about taking an
airliner and turning it into a missile? How would you coerce the pilot
to fly into a building that's got people into it rather than in
extremis, put it into a field or a woods or into the -- in the case of
the CIA, into the Potomac? How would you do that? And the notion of a
fully-fledged member of al Qaeda being a pilot, at the same time with
the intention of pulling people out of the cockpit and taking over, did
not occur to me. Now, my point, when I go back to it, why didn't I spend
more time? Why didn't I get more people around the table and say, how
would they do this? And come up with a plan, that's my regret.

MR. ROEMER: Mr. Flynn, you mentioned that we didn't develop policy and
the big picture connecting the dots to change policy to proactively go
after what terrorists might do given the threats that were out there -
MR. FLYNN: I didn't mention that, I may not have said it - MR. ROEMER:
You said you regret that we did not - MR. FLYNN: We didn't deal with
that particular scenario.

That isn't to say that we didn't look at a host of other things.

MR. ROEMER: Well, let's talk about -- did you push with Mrs. Garvey,
other people, the administrator, did you push for a policy change? Did
you try to get meetings with other policy makers to address this growing
concern that's mentioned in the FAA, Federal Register, that's mentioned
in your slide presentation that you're presenting to people as you're
traveling across the country in 2000 and 2001?

MR. FLYNN: Well, I think that -- it's more than a footnote that that
particular presentation, 2001, I was no longer in FAA. But the -

MR. ROEMER: Leading up to that point.

MR. FLYNN: Yeah, that's my -- it's a funny thing. In that same time, the
head of anti-terrorism for the FBI and I came to this building, into the
secure place of the Committee on Intelligence and in it these staff --
there may be some people from that staff who happen to be coincidentally
members of your staff -- the staff asked what are the indications or
what are the threats to aviation? And John O'Neill said there are none.
Now, that seemed to me to -- because there was particular indication of
something going on in an airport, I wrote him a note. John, how about
the -- and he looked at the note, still didn't say anything, didn't
change what he had said. And we came out of the meeting and I said, what
about the -- that specific thing, and he said there's nothing to it.

We're also being told that those groups that are there were -- they're
essentially connected with Hezbollah or fundraisers rather than actual
terrorist people plotting terrorism, and we're -- was told because
pushed on it frequently, "Don't worry about it, we're not going to give
you raw intelligence, we're not going to give you processed
intelligence. If there is a threat to aviation, we will tell you."

MR. ROEMER: And this is who?

MR. FLYNN: Robert Blitzer.

MR. ROEMER: With respect to -

MR. FLYNN: No.

MR. ROEMER: Acting on -

MR. FLYNN: No, no.

MR. ROEMER: Okay.

MR. FLYNN: At the same time, there was an element of common sense in
this. You have 1993, the World Trade Center, you have these groups that
may or may not be associated with al Qaeda because nobody knew what al
Qaeda was. Nobody knew, and to this day I'm not sure how much people
understand the full motivations, capabilities, connections, et cetera of
the al Qaeda organization.

MR. ROEMER: Mr. Flynn, I just read an example as far back as September
1998 that the intelligence community obtained an information specific to
Usama bin Laden that his next operation could involve flying aircraft
loaded with explosives into a U.S. airport.

MR. FLYNN: I don't recall that. I mean, that's such a startling thing -

MR. ROEMER: Well, we can talk about your liaisons to the FBI and to the
CIA and to the National Security Council, the point is -- go ahead, sir.

MR. FLYNN: Let me get back on my train of thought, is that despite
saying there are no indications of it happening, the commonsense of it
is that it could happen, that where there are terrorists one of their
likely targets will be aviation.

MR. ROEMER: Let's talk about that being a likely target. There is a
TIPOFF list at the State Department that you don't know about until
yesterday, that you don't know about that exists prior to September 11.
Mr. Manno, this list has approximately 61,000 names of people around the
world that are prevented from flying, that are picked out by the State
Department at that point and they're picked out because they're
dangerous and they shouldn't be on airplanes, 61,000 names.

Your list, according to what you just said, or what our staff has told
me, is 12 people. So there's a difference of 60,988 names, a difference
of 60,988 names between what's been accumulated at the State Department
as dangerous people, shouldn't be flying, and what you have with your 12
people. Now, I can't understand why there are not more efforts in
liaison activities to reach out to State Department and start to bring
some of those names over and prevent those people from flying.

MR. MANNO: Well, again the process at the time was to include in the
security directive names of people where there was specific and credible
information that they posed a threat. Part of that process required,
because a lot of times the information was classified, that it be
declassified because the information circulars in the security
directives were not classified documents that went out to the industry.
And it was simply very difficult to get clearance from the community in
cases where there wasn't a direct connection to civil aviation for them
to get the release information. We had to justify that in each case.
Now, did we do it? Did we go in and say we want all 61,000 of these
names? No, that was not -- we didn't do that. We focused on the
information, again, that was specific to aviation at the time.

MR. ROEMER: Let's talk about the pre-screening program, affirm that. The
CAPPS program, Mr. Flynn, the pre-screening program, the computer
assisted passenger pre-screening program, picked out nine of the 19
hijackers, terrorists, on September the 11th. It didn't do anything to
-- what did it do to try to prevent and use common sense and provide a
higher standard of keeping these people off the plane? The CAPPS system
was designed with -- you know, factoring algorithms and weights and
other things to say these people are a significant or a heightened
threat to U.S. aircraft. Yet all nine that were picked out made it
through the system. Why is that?

MR. FLYNN: The CAPPS system and you -- I commend to you for reading the
report of the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security,
was intended to ration or to allocate the measures for checked baggage
on flights within the United States. That commission, who took their
responsibilities I'm sure just as seriously as all of you do, and
included in it the DCI and the director of the FBI, looked at CAPPS and
said what we ought to do with regards checked baggage in the United
States, is to use CAPPS as the process for determining the checked
baggage process. With regard to the checkpoint you don't need it because
it is a 100 percent application.

I remind you with regard to explosive detection systems, they cost $1
million a piece. Their installation costs vary from on up -- the
installation can result in the total cost of -multiply three times the
cost of the equipment for installation. The recommendation of that
commission was have a capital budget of $100 million a year. A very low
estimate of the number of checked baggage EDS that you would need in the
United States is 1,000. Of that $100 million a considerable amount was
to be used for other things, checkpoint equipment for example. So one
would have a budget on average of $50 million a year for EDS. So we're
looking at a 20-year program in order to install that equipment at best,
so you needed to have some way of narrowing its application and that's
what CAPPS was for.

MR. ROEMER: How did it narrow the application for anybody -- outside of
intending to use explosive devices? How did it go at somebody that might
hijack a plane? Especially given that these hijackers on September 11th
may have had four-inch knives on them, walked through security, been
detected with the knives and probably handed the knives back? Why did
CAPPS pick these people out, allow them through and probably even allow
them through with knives?

MR. FLYNN: It would have required the security measures for their
checked baggage.

MR. ROEMER: Nothing else? Other than -- see, they could have had a knife
on them, made the CAPPS weight and rhythm standard, been picked out as
somebody with a substantially higher security risk, and still be handed
back a four-inch knife to get on a plane?

MR. FLYNN: The checkpoint would not have even been aware of it. It was a
process -

MR. ROEMER: Why would we not try to anticipate that given all the
information coming in -

MR. FLYNN: There was no information in it -

MR. ROEMER: There's no information that I just went through, Mr. Flynn,
about people that might be interested in hijacking planes or using
planes as weapons?

MR. FLYNN: Oh, sure, in CAPPS the information is drawn from the
passenger name record, has to do with behavior that is indicative of and
then contra-indications of the behavior that indicates that you're not
involved in any acts of crime towards the aircraft. Again -

MR. ROEMER: Excuse me? Can you repeat that?

MR. FLYNN: Well, there are two things in it. There are positives and
negatives in CAPPS.

MR. ROEMER: Well, we don't need to get into the giving potential
terrorist information as to why they're picked out.

MR. FLYNN: But doesn't lead to any identification of people as
terrorists.

MR. ROEMER: Let me ask you about your relationship with some of the
other security intelligence agencies that you're supposedly working with
leading up to September 11th.

MR. FLYNN: Yeah, I'd like to but let me deal with your previous point -

MR. ROEMER: I've only got a couple of minutes left, Mr. Flynn, and I
want to get Mr. Manno in here as well, too. Your relationship with the
FBI.

MR. FLYNN: Yes.

MR. ROEMER: You and Mr. Manno have both indicated that -I think one of
Mr. Manno's quotes is, quote, "You guys can tell us, the FBI, you can
tell us what's happening on a street in Kabul but you can't tell us
what's going on in Atlanta." I think your comment is you know more about
what is happening in Beirut than what may be happening in Detroit. Why
isn't the FBI able to pass on more actionable information, more helpful
information? Why aren't you querying them more when all this more
general information is coming in about terrorism and a U.S. presence of
these terrorists and the threat to domestic airlines? Why aren't we
seeing a better relationship and more information exchanged here? Why is
there this so-called blind spot?

MR. FLYNN: The FBI has to do with protection of information in
investigations and protection of grand jury information and various
other things. But the point is that while I admire the people of the FBI
and personally have excellent relations with them, we're friends and
everything. That it was -- and I did insist and I got to the point where
I decided that I was running the risk of making them angry and thought
I'd better back off and ask Mr. Manno's predecessor, Mr. McDonald, to
keep on the pressure because I was clearly irritating them by saying we
need to know more, there's got to be more.

MR. ROEMER: So you kept querying the FBI to get more, to get more, to do
more and they did not? MR. FLYNN: Well, they probably did but they just
weren't - you know - MR. ROEMER: Did they pass it on to you? MR. FLYNN:
Didn't pass it on to me. MR. ROEMER: You were not getting the adequate
cooperation

from the FBI for actionable intelligence about threats in the United
States, is that correct?

MR. FLYNN: Yeah, and then when it turned out to it and other people
asked them, it turned out that there wasn't an awful lot other than the
United States being used as an R&R base for terrorists.

MR. ROEMER: Mr. Manno, how would you characterize your relationship with
the FBI?

MR. FLYNN: Well, we clearly got a lot more information from elements of
the government that collected it overseas. Domestically we had a lot
less information and we recognized that. That was one of the reasons why
we started discussions with FBI and in 1996 actually assigned somebody
to be our liaison over there and to try to place them in the right place
in the FBI where we would get the most benefit.

As you know, it's a very big bureaucracy, very compartmented, and so our
person over there basically had to make the rounds to try to get, you
know, to get information. But I always had to do -- I mean the approach
of the FBI at that time, it was an investigative agency. Everything was
approached as an investigation and I think their view was if there was
credible and specific information of interest to you we will provide it
to you, and I think that they did.

They also cooperated with us. For example, earlier you had mentioned
these two threats about crashing an airplane into the World Trade Center
and another one about crashing a plane into an airport in the United
States which we had factored those two things in some of the assessments
that we had written about that potential threat. Well, the FBI actually
ran those two threats to ground and discredited them.

MR. ROEMER: Did they share the files, the paperwork, the information
with you?

MR. MANNO: They told us that it was not credible.

MR. ROEMER: Did they share the information, the paperwork and the
background documents with you?

MR. MANNO: No. I don't think so beyond that, beyond telling us that
there was nothing to -

MR. ROEMER: They verbally told you, "Here was what we found and we
dismissed it?" They didn't exchange any kind of paperwork with you?

MR. MANNO: No because again they had assessed it as not credible.

MR. ROEMER: So you're saying the FBI, there was a blind spot there that
you did not get as much information on the domestic situation in Atlanta
as you might have been getting on Kabul. The TIPOFF program, you were
not getting the names from the TIPOFF program in the State Department.
There was a gap of about, you know, 60,988 names. Where were you getting
your actual intelligence?

MR. MANNO: We did get some from the FBI. We got a lot of it from CIA. We
also had a liaison officer assigned to the Counterterrorism Center at
CIA and another one at the State Department in the threat analysis shop.
So there was a lot of State Department reporting, a lot of CIA
reporting, some FBI information, but not a daily from the FBI, not a
daily flow as to what was going on in the United States in regards to
their investigations. If they came across something specific, something
that they assessed to be specific and credible in their investigations
and we were fairly confident that they would provide that to us either
directly or through our liaison officer. But we don't know what we don't
know.

MR. ROEMER: Why didn't you have a liaison to NSA or to DIA?

MR. MANNO: At that time, we were a very small staff. In fact, our total
shop was about 24 analysts and it was a matter of resources. Subsequent
to that, of course, we now have a liaison officer at NSA, at TTIC and
other places, some of which didn't even exist back then. But in trying
to decide where we would assign people, again limited resources, it's
where we thought we would get the most information, where it was most
valuable. We did have a customer service representative from NSA that
visited our office and couriered information to us. So there was a
relationship with NSA. We just did not have someone there at that time.

MR. ROEMER: Mr. Chairman, thank you.

MR. KEAN: Senator Kerrey.

MR. BOB KERREY: Commissioner Garvey, I'd like to ask you a couple of
questions. You had your first five-year term, I believe -

MS. GARVEY: That's correct, Commissioner.

MR. KERREY: So you were appointed in '97 and you served all the way to
2002.

MS. GARVEY: That is correct.

MR. KERREY: During that five-year period, did you ever get any
complaints about the airlines?

MS. GARVEY: Complaints about the airlines or complaints from the
airlines, I'm sorry?

MR. KERREY: I presume you got complaints from the airlines but did you
ever get any complaints from passengers about the airlines?

MS. GARVEY: The passenger complaints would go into the Department of
Transportation into the chief counsel's office. We didn't specifically
get complaints in that way.

MR. KERREY: Are you alert to any complaints about excessive applications
of Title 49 of the U.S. Code, the section 44902 that gives the airlines
the authority -- and their language is to refuse to transport a
passenger or property which carriage is or might be inimical to safety?

MS. GARVEY: We might have gotten some complaints. In fact, I'm sure we
did in the Safety Office regarding -- from passengers about perhaps
being mistreated or not treated correctly, at least in their view.

MR. KERREY: That's not the same thing as -

MS. GARVEY: No, no. I'm not recalling any and I'm sorry.

MR. KERREY: I'd just like to know because one of the things that I keep
hearing is, gee, we don't want to put anybody on the list because we'd
be harassing people and I've -

MS. GARVEY: Well, I see what you're saying.

MR. KERREY: I've stood in lots of security lines and heard lots of
complaints but I've never heard that somebody has been removed from the
airlines that was unsafe. I've heard a lot more complaints about people
who have been prevented from getting on airlines than just because of
the -- what I consider at the moment to be largely reactive as security
measure but that's another point.

The no-fly list has been referenced a couple of times. Are you familiar
with the no-fly list?

MS. GARVEY: Yes, absolutely, Commissioner and you know, again from my
perspective and I know there has been a number of questions on this, but
from the administrator's perspective, the no-fly list, as Mr. Manno
indicated, was created based on information we received from others with
a specific aviation -

MR. KERREY: You got Security Directive 95 of 02H, updated April 24th,
2000. Six people who are associates of Ramzi Yousef, including Khalid
Shaikh Mohammed that are on the list. That's six. I presume the airlines
have no difficulty handling six.

Mr. Manno, you wouldn't defend the airlines if they complained about
trying to keep six people off? It may be difficult for all I know. I
don't know. Is it harder than it looks?

MR. MANNO: No, not with a list that small.

MR. KERREY: What was the judgment that was made in April 2000 to put
these six on the list? On what basis was Khalid Shaikh Mohammed,
Ibrahim, all these guys -- there was six people on the list and then
there's six more that come on the list on August 28, '01. They're also
added on the list and, by the way, they all -- every single one are
associated with some Islamic extremist group.

And I really think part of the problem that we're having today is we
continue to tread lightly on this fact. And we keep calling them all
terrorists, you know, as if there's a worldwide network of terrorists of
all different stripes, of all different genders, all different kinds. I
mean, the only one that makes the list -- there's actually a couple of
people lower down the list that appear on there that may not be
associated with this Islamic extremist effort -- are people who are
associated with some Islamist extremist network. Is that your
understanding of it? Is that how they made the list? I mean, they're
making the list because -

MR. MANNO: The way that those individuals made the list is that it came
out of the investigation being conducted by the FBI and by the
Philippine authority.

MR. KERREY: So did the FBI recommend they be put on the list?

MR. MANNO: We received information that actually had originated in a
cooperative effort between FBI and CIA. So we receive intelligence
reporting that these individuals were tied to -

MR. KERREY: You receive intelligence reporting from CIA and FBI?

MR. MANNO: Yes, sir.

MR. KERREY: Saying that these six should be on the list? Did you -

MR. MANNO: No, sir. That they were associated with Ramzi Yousef who, as
you well know, had been involved in the Bojinka plot and that they were
in some way tied to that plot. So we had a concern, a specific concern
about these individuals, not knowing what else they might have been up
to and therefore -

MR. KERREY: Did you consider putting other people on the list at the
time that might have some association with Ramzi Yousef?

MR. MANNO: These were the names that came to us in the intelligence
reporting. Again it was tied back to the specific plot.

MR. KERREY: You're confusing me, Mr. Manno. At one point you're saying
you're making the decision. Now it's somebody else that's making the
decision. You're making the decision who to put on the list and I'm
asking you, did you consider putting other people on the list beside
these six?

MR. MANNO: As far as I know, at that time, those were the only names
that we had tied to that plot.

MR. KERREY: Did you put out an inquiry as to whether or not there might
be some additional names that should be put on the list?

MR. MANNO: Absolutely. It's part of our standard -

MR. KERREY: Who did you put the inquiry to?

MR. MANNO: With CIA.

MR. KERREY: Do you remember the response?

MR. MANNO: No, sir.

MR. KERREY: You now remember you presume that they didn't respond?

MR. MANNO: Part of the process for us, whenever we open one of the
intelligence case files that I mentioned earlier, is to follow up on
that and to continue to ask questions for additional information. So
it's just part of the process. It's not something that was done only in
this case. It's done in all cases where -

MR. KERREY: I just score the point that a number of other commissioners
have made. Given the specificity of U.S. Code 49, what it requires the
airlines to do, it seems to me, particularly with what was going on at
the time, that some effort would have been made to make -- to produce a
larger list than that. And again, I score the point, to call them
terrorists as opposed to saying this is a part of a worldwide network of
Islamic extremists, I think, makes it exceptionally difficult to do what
you need to do, which is to identify those who are extremists and keep
them on the no-fly list and keep them watchlisted as opposed to having a
sort of a broad blanket screen that might produce harassment of people
who just look like they might be Muslim extremists. I think there is a
paradox here. Not saying what it actually is, you end up harassing
people who may not actually be terrorists. But that's a longer point.

Let me ask you, Mr. Manno. You were the deputy -- was it Pat McDonald
who was your predecessor?

MR. MANNO: Yes.

MR. KERREY: Were you present when he did the CD-ROM briefing on April
2000?

MR. MANNO: When it was produced, yes.

MR. KERREY: Were you present in April 2000 when he presented it?

Administrator Garvey, were you present when this -

MS. GARVEY: No, I was not.

MR. KERREY: Have you seen the details of it?

MS. GARVEY: I have not. It has only been reported to me.

MR. KERREY: When was it reported to you?

MS. GARVEY: Post-9/11.

MR. KERREY: Have you seen it, Mr. Manno?

MR. MANNO: The CD-ROM was actually produced in about 700 copies and
disseminated to the aviation industry, airports, FAA field offices. So
it was actually quite widespread.

MR. KERREY: I have here the rebuttal that you all have sent up for
Eleanor Hill's statements that she made to the Joint Inquiry. She was, I
think, the staff director for the Joint Inquiry. Things that she said
about the FAA, didn't do this, didn't do this, didn't do this, and your
rebuttals are basically, we didn't know, we didn't get the intel, nobody
told us, right down the list. The CIA didn't tell us, FBI didn't tell
us.

And I've got to say just honestly, if it had been two or three of them,
I would have been on your side, but when it accumulates like 15 or 20 of
them, at some point you say, geez, why didn't you push back and ask? I
mean, I just tell you, my reaction to your rebuttals does not bring
glory to the agency. It's quite the opposite. It causes me to say, I
don't understand how there could be so many situations where you simply
say, they didn't tell us.

This, by the way, is not they didn't tell us. You go through the 29
slides I think we've got here, 29 slides. Mr. Manno -

MR. MANNO: Yes, sir, I'm familiar with it.

MR. KERREY: -- you've gone through them?

MR. MANNO: Pardon?

MR. KERREY: You've gone through the slides?

MR. MANNO: Yes, sir.

MR. KERREY: Well, this is your own agency making an assessment of
Islamic extremist and the dangers and the threat that they pose to the
United States of America. It's not terrorists again. I hope I don't
offend too much some of my Muslim friends who think that I'm being nasty
in this regard. But there's nobody on this list except UBL and people
that are associated with UBL or other Islamic extremist groups. I mean,
that's basically what this is a presentation of. I mean, Hezbollah's
identified as a threat, but you're talking about UBL all the way through
this thing. You're talking about Usama bin Laden and al Qaeda and the
threat that they present to the United States of America.

MR. MANNO: Well, historically the groups that have targeted aviation
have been Islamic extremists, yes.

MR. KERREY: Historically?

MR. MANNO: Hezbollah. Pardon, sir?

MR. KERREY: Historically?

MR. MANNO: Historically. Going back to Hezbollah, for example, is one of
the other groups.

MR. KERREY: Give me historically. What are you talking about
historically? Last 10 years?

MR. MANNO: Since 1985, with the hijacking of TWA 847 by Hezbollah.

MR. KERREY: Did any change occur in 1998?

MR. MANNO: No.

MR. KERREY: So you're saying that basically you've got a -I mean, are
you saying that there's no increase and concern about the danger to the
United States from Islamic extremists in 1998?

MR. MANNO: No. There was. And we wrote several assessments, sent out
information circulars and -

MR. KERREY: But if you -- let me just pull up one of these slides. I
think it was the one that Commissioner Roemer quoted from. I've got to
get the exact -- no, I've got it right here unfortunately. It's slide
24. When the conclusion is -- and I guess, Irish, I'm asking you on this
one, which is when the conclusion is reached in slide 24, that
fortunately we have no indication any group is currently thinking in
that direction. That's the statement that's made. And there's a lot in
that statement. We have no indication that any group is currently
thinking in that direction.

I mean, the first question I would ask is, so, do I need an indication
that somebody is thinking in that direction? I mean, take the Ressam
plot. We've got the details of the Ressam plot not ahead of time. We
didn't have the Ressam plot prior to arresting Ressam in Seattle, did
we? I mean, even the threat to LAX. We didn't knock that threat down as
a consequence of security at LAX. We didn't discover the details of the
plot. So when you say, Administrator Garvey, we had -- your language is
we had no credible and specific intelligence indicator that UBL and all
the rest of them were actually plotting to hijack commercial planes, I'd
say do you have to have a specific plot? Do you need a memo from them
saying, this is what we're going to do? And the answer's no.

And so when you say, we have no indication any group is currently
thinking in that direction, I wondered, did you -- was there a
conversation? Is that challenged internally? I don't know what the
process is. Do you have a conversation with anybody from the National
Security Council? How do you get that double-checked, because as it
turns out, it wasn't true?

MR. MANNO: That was an analytical judgment. There was no specific and
credible information that al Qaeda or anybody else -

MR. KERREY: No, no. Believe me, I know it's an analytical judgment. I
recognize it as an analytical judgment. The question is, was Jim or Mary
or Dick sitting there saying their analytical judgment was completely
different. And, in fact, looking at some of the previous slides, some of
the previous slides state just the opposite, seem to indicate just the
opposite. I mean, the possibility of a suicide bombing attack was
mentioned in one of the previous slides. I mean, I do this

\- I mean, it's not like I don't have internal contradictions that I
don't need my wife or somebody else to point out, but did anybody else
disagree at that presentation? Did anybody internal to FAA security
disagree with that conclusion?

MR. MANNO: No. But, again, the hijacking threat was not discounted. But
in the grand scheme of things, looking at the variety of threats that we
were looking at, it was considered less of a threat at the time than -

MR. KERREY: Okay. So it's less of a threat. You say it's a low
probability. That's not very comforting to passengers to hear that if
it's a low probability, don't do anything with it. I mean, God, how high
probability is it I'm going to do any damage with my fingernail clippers
on an airplane, but you take those every damn time I get on the plane.
So you've got a low probability for hijacking and therefore we're not
going to put much energy into it. Is that what you're saying?

MR. FLYNN: May I -

MR. KERREY: Yes, sir.

MR. FLYNN: We were working hard on the anti-hijacking. And the
improvement of the pre-board screening was an important aspect of it. I
did not see, and as I said earlier, should have worked at it harder to
see how is it that they'd bring it about.

MR. KERREY: Well, let me -- can I -

MR. FLYNN: Sure.

MR. KERREY: I'll just make the declaratory, because I want to -

MR. FLYNN: And with regard to the thing you were reading, that happens
to be after I left FAA. But the -MR. KERREY: In May of 2000?

MR. FLYNN: Was that in May of 2000?

MR. KERREY: May of 2000.

MR. FLYNN: No, no. That was before. That was when I was there.

MR. KERREY: I mean, I just tell you, I asked staff to give this to me
and I just read it this morning and you can't blame the CIA and the FBI
on that one. I mean, you've got enough information already internal to
FAA that said you be -- it's not -- again, it's Usama bin Laden and
Muslim extremists. I mean, there was one incident of a hijacking with
the possibility of a suicide where they were actually saying they wanted
Ramzi Yousef released. I mean, the whole story line as presented just by
that single narrative from that presentation in May says we better be
careful about hijacking. We better move the possibility even of a
suicide hijacking up on our list.

And, by the way, the declaratory that I wanted to make to all of you is
that I know it's a very sensitive document, but among the concerns that
I had pre-9/11 and I've really got it still today, are the details of
what's called the -- what do you call it, the Air Carrier Standard
Security Program. Are you all familiar with the air carrier?
Administrator Garvey, are you -

MS. GARVEY: Yes. Yes, sir.

MR. KERREY: I mean, that's basically -- you know, what do people do on
the plane if they're facing a hijacker. And I think those procedures
were wrong. On the morning of the 11th of September, I think those
procedures made it almost impossible for these guys not to fail. They
would need these -- the Leatherman knives that were being passed around.
I think the procedures were flawed then and my concern is they may still
be flawed. mean, are they reviewed?

I mean, Irish, as a special ops guy, do you look at these things and
say, okay, now you've got four guys on an airplane, a relatively
confined piece of real estate. And you've followed what Congress has
done. My God, the pilots have guns now. You know, and my experience is
people have become pilots because they don't know how to use guns, now
they got guns. And, by the way, they're going to be shooting in the
wrong direction as far as I'm concerned.

So, I mean, have we reviewed this? Was it on the list of things in May
of 2000 as you're evaluating what you're going to do to carry out U.S.
Code 49? Who are you going to deny on there? Who's going to be dangerous
on there? Is that part of the evaluation that was going on? If so, why
was it not changed? Yes, sir.

MR. FLYNN: With regard to keeping -- preventing of hijacking, the
program for it was indeed to keep determined hijackers off. And the
hijacking scenario that one had in mind was taking the aircraft, taking
it on the ground, taking it on the air, but bringing it to ground and
asking for the release of people, for example.

MR. KERREY: How many flights a day in the United States of America?

MR. FLYNN: Forty thousand.

MR. KERREY: Commercial flights.

MS. GARVEY: I was going to say 35,000 to 40,000.

MR. KERREY: One of -- I mean, I understand that I -- I've got obviously
some sharp questions of all of you what was going on pre-9/11. I'm also
very much aware what I was being told by Sandy Berger, George Tenet and
others about bin Laden and I know that it was in a presidential
directive written after 1998 and I said it before and I'll say it again.
After the attack on Dar es Salaam in Nairobi -- and I say it with great
respect, Administrator Garvey -- you said that after 9/11, there was a
war, before 9/11, there was a war. There was a war before 9/11. It
didn't start with 9/11. That was one of the military actions against us.

There was a war going on before that and I'm not blaming you for this
because it seems to me at some point the President's national security
advisor, whether it was President Clinton or President Bush or Burger or
Rice, they got to drive this thing all the way down to the FAA or it's
not going to work. You're the only -- with all kinds of other problems,
whether it's CIA or the FBI simply saying, "We're not going to tell you
what's going on." But at the time, in 1998, there was no question that
bin Laden was public enemy number one and that he had declared on us and
that, by the way, he was enormously sophisticated.

It was not like World Trade Center I where somebody was trying to get a
refund on a Ryder truck. They were very sophisticated to be able to hit
Dar es Salaam and Nairobi in the way that they did and it should have, I
think, then driven all the way down to the FAA so that you modified and
changed the procedures on that airplane -- on those airplanes. I
passionately believe that's the case.

MR. ROEMER: If I could just jump in -

MR. KERREY: You can take over.

MR. ROEMER: -- it wasn't just a one-trick pony. We did not have other
mechanisms to go after things other than explosives. In testimony to
Senator McCain's committee, Administrator Garvey, you said and I quote,
"All of our security directives, all of our security recommendations in
the past have been geared toward explosives. This was a whole new world
for us."

MS. GARVEY: That is correct, sir. I mean, the assumptions were -- as you
all have indicated, as the staff indicated in their report -- the
assumptions were turned on its head and that's correct.

MR. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. KEAN: Commissioner Gorelick.

MS. JAMIE S. GORELICK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

These are questions for Admiral Flynn and Director Manno. You were both
present, in your respective positions, in the run-up to the millennium.
My first question for you is this, did you have procedures in place for
enhancing the security measures at airports or otherwise when there
would be a security alert? Did you have the ability to ratchet up the
policies and procedures for security before people boarded aircraft?

MR. FLYNN: Yes.

MS. GORELICK: In the period just before the millennium, when the entire
government was on alert about the possibility of a terrorist act in the
United States, did you take any steps to increase security measures or
enhance security measure in our airports or pre-boarding?

MR. FLYNN: We had and the entire baseline effort was directed towards
that.

MS. GORELICK: I don't understand the answer. In the period

MR. FLYNN: I'm sorry. From the period of '96 through 2000, we were
working all the time to improve the effectiveness of pre-board
screenings?

MS. GORELICK: But you just said you had the capacity to ratchet up
security measures -

MR. FLYNN: Yes.

MS. GORELICK: -- and I'm asking, in the period prior to the millennium
when the entire government was on alert, did you put in place those
enhanced measures?

MR. FLYNN: They were in place. We did not, that I recall, other than
when Ressam was caught -- then we did some additional specific
information. But I don't recall SDs that we did in that period because
we were strengthening the basic program to deal with that.

MS. GORELICK: So, just so I understand it, after Ressam was caught and
we knew that there was an attempt to infiltrate this country, that
specifically airports were being targeted, did you or did you not take
additional measures beyond the measures that had been in place before he
was caught to strengthen security in aviation?

MR. FLYNN: I don't recall putting on SDs at that time. recall very
definitely that what we did with regards to Ressam is make everyone
aware of what a bomb made with the materials that he had would look like
and we did that even before I was aware that LAX was on his mind.

MS. GORELICK: So, in other words, your response was to disseminate
specific information but not to do things like look at carry-ons,
inspect carry-ons, which you weren't routinely doing or look for
additional names to put on a no-fly list or anything else that might
relate to aviation security.

MR. FLYNN: We were routinely and with increased emphasis looking at
carry-ons.

MS. GORELICK: You were inspecting the insides of carry-ons or you were
screening carry-ons?

MR. FLYNN: Both.

MS. GORELICK: On a routine basis, you were looking on the inside of
carry-ons prior -

MR. FLYNN: We had a continuous opening and search routine. In effect, it
was at random and then additionally, when there was any indication in an
X-ray requiring that there was something dangerous that required
opening, all electronic items and on a random basis additionally, there
was trace explosive detection that had been done at that point.

MS. GORELICK: When someone set off a magnetometer, was their bag
routinely opened? Their carry-on bag?

MR. FLYNN: No.

MS. GORELICK: When they set off a magnetometer twice, was their bag
opened?

MR. FLYNN: Not unless there was some indication in the bag or if
something dangerous was determined -- was taken off the person, then
there had to be additional scrutiny of the bag. If there was cause to
suspect this person.

MS. GORELICK: You answered my question a minute ago. asked you whether
there were enhanced procedures that you could utilize when there was a
specific security alert, you said yes. What were those procedures? What
would you do when there was a security alert, when you were essentially
going to orange from yellow, although we didn't have color coding at the
time?

MR. FLYNN: One could require, for example, searches of vehicles at the
front of the terminal. One could require the stopping of parking within
a certain range of the terminal. We could require additional searches of
people on the basis of some indication that would come to you that they
would be naval aviators from Philadelphia or whatever.

MS. GORELICK: In the spring and summer of 2001 -- I guess this would be
a question for Mr. Manno -- you were aware, were you not, of the
heightened security warnings that were going out through the government?

MR. MANNO: We put out warnings during that timeframe as well for our
customers.

MS. GORELICK: Did you consider, at that time, increasing the security
measures in the way that Admiral Flynn has just described to meet this
enhanced security threat?

MR. MANNO: It was not the role of the Office of Intelligence to direct
security measures. Our role was to try, to the extent that we could, to
identify the threats and then provide that information to the aviation
policy and operations folks to determine whether or not measures should
be increased. There were efforts that were made. Going back to the
Ressam example, there was a mad effort to try to figure out what he was
actually up to.

In fact, one of the things that was done was that our bomb explosives --
our explosives unit looked at what was actually seized and tried to
figure out, okay, with these types of explosives, these types of timers,
what sort of device could be constructed to target civil aviation. And
then, based on that information, the possibility that having those
components, what could be done. We sent out an information circular to
sensitize screeners and the airlines to that potential threat.

MS. GORELICK: But you had in the - turning back to the summer, spring
and summer of 2001, we have heard testimony and we have ample evidence
that across the intelligence community, literally hair was on fire
through June through the summer and even going back a little bit before
June but through the spring and the summer, a high, high state of alert
-

MR. FLYNN: Let me try again. It started with the World Trade Center. It
continued with Yousef's efforts out in the Pacific and it continued with
the information that we've been talking about, the various interests of
the UBL in attacking us. And in '96-'97 we hammered out an elevated
baseline. We had been going back and forth with security directives with
occasional spikes in security and then bringing them down. We said, no,
we get it up to this level.

And our effort in those times of undetermined but probably higher
threat, what's happening with the millennium? Well, we don't really know
what's going to happen at the millennium, but something is going to
happen. What you do in those -- what they did in those circumstances was
to increase surveillance on all the inspection activities and to
increase awareness in the form of putting out ICs and meetings with the
security directors and meetings with the airlines and meetings with the
airports to say, we need to be on our toes.

MS. GORELICK: So the additional measures -- you could and did take
additional measures when there was a high level of security alert. Is
that correct?

MR. FLYNN: No. The baseline was meant to deal with an elevated level of
security.

MS. GORELICK: So you did not have additional -- I am terribly confused
here. Now -

MR. FLYNN: I'm sorry.

MS. GORELICK: -- please excuse me. I asked you the question whether you
had additional measures that you could take that you had. I understand
you were -- you feel that you were operating from a high baseline.

MR. FLYNN: Right.

MS. GORELICK: I asked you did you have additional measures that you
could take? And the measures could be anything from sending out
directives, to engaging with airport security personnel, to engaging
directly with the airlines, to changing the modalities like searching
and getting additional names for the no-fly list. There's a panoply of
things that you could do above the baseline. I'm asking a pretty
straight forward question. Did you have measures that you could use when
there was a heightened period of alert, yes or no?

MR. FLYNN: Yes.

MS. GORELICK: In the period prior to the millennium, after Ressam was
apprehended and it was clear in what is already public and certainly in
what we know from classified briefings that the entire government was on
alert, that there was tracking of people who meant to do harm in this
country and that some of that harm was focused on our airlines and our
aircraft, did you take additional measures at that time to secure the
airlines?

MR. FLYNN: I did not impose, that I recall, additional specific
measures.

MS. GORELICK: You did not?

MR. FLYNN: Not that I recall. I may be wrong about that.

MS. GORELICK: In the spring and summer of 2001 when, as our briefings
and testimony to us have indicated, the hair of the intelligence
community was on fire given the nature of the warnings that we were
getting, not specific as to what would happen, but that something was
about to happen, (a) were you aware of those warnings? And I guess you
were gone by then, is that right, Admiral Flynn? So I'll put that
question to Director Manno.

Were you aware of that state of affairs?

MR. MANNO: Yes. And, as I said, we also issued information circulars
regarding those to -

MS. GORELICK: Did you advise or advocate any further steps than issuing
the directives or security circulars that you issued?

MR. MANNO: Again, the role of intelligence is to provide the
intelligence and not to direct or make specific security
recommendations.

MS. GORELICK: I'm limited here because I don't have in front of me
Admiral Flynn's successor, so I'll turn to Ms. Garvey.

Did you consider taking any additional security steps in the spring and
summer of 2001 in response to the heightened security warnings?

MS. GARVEY: I know we put out additional security directives, and I'd
have to go back and look and see specifically if there were additional
measures that were included, and we can do that and provide that for the
record. But you're absolutely right. We were aware of increased
activity, had been briefed directly by Admiral Flynn's successor on the
concern and that is reflected both in the security directives and in the
information circulars.

If I also could, just to go back to Y2K for a moment or to the
millennium, while -- and again I'll provide for the record or ask the
FAA and TSA to provide for the record specifically if any directives
went out or intelligence circulars went out at that time. I can tell you
that there were any number of meetings across the Administration, across
DOT that involved the FAA and the industry about concerns related both
to safety and security. The Department of Transportation had a couple of
tabletop exercises that I participated in, and the principal focus
obviously was to make sure that we had the measures in place that we
had, that we were doing everything we possibly could.

MS. GORELICK: And this occurred in the run-up to the millennium. Is that
correct?

MS. GARVEY: This occurred in the run up to the millennium.

MS. GORELICK: And was there analogous -- were there analogous meetings
across the government at a very high level with industry tabletops, as
you were describing, in the spring and summer of 2001?

MS. GARVEY: I can't say for certainty that there were. My understanding
is that there were. I know that at the Department of Transportation we
certainly were engaged in that, as well as the very direct communication
on -- I don't want to say a daily basis, but certainly a weekly basis
with members of the industry.

MS. GORELICK: But you were the administrator at both times. Correct?

MS. GARVEY: Yes, that's correct, Commissioner.

MS. GORELICK: Okay. And you remember doing what you just described in
the run up to the millennium. Is that correct?

MS. GARVEY: That's correct.

MS. GORELICK: Do you have a similar specific recollection of your
involvement in the spring and summer of 2001?

MS. GARVEY: No, I do not, Commissioner. No, no tabletop exercises. 2000
and 2001 what I remember more specifically would be the intelligence
briefings I would get from my own internal intelligence people.

MS. GORELICK: Can you compare the intensity of your agency's response to
the intelligence that you were getting in the end of 1999 with the
intensity of your agency's response in the spring and summer of 2001?

MS. GARVEY: Well, certainly Y2K there was an intensity because it was a
deadline that we knew was looming. It was a deadline that was there and
it had enormous implications even from a safety perspective, or at least
we were concerned that it might. I think the intensity that you describe
was probably in the summer of 2000 and 2001, particularly 2001.
Certainly I had a concern based on what I was hearing.

I think the great frustration -- and I understand the Commissioners'
frustration with the statement credible and reliable, and I always -- I
don't want to -- I understand the frustration with that phrase. But on
the other hand, I think -and I think to some degree the security people
are feeling the same thing today. You want to do the right thing, but
you want to have enough information so that you're acting appropriately.
You're not either putting measures in place that are inappropriate,
beyond or may not be dealing with the real threat at hand.

MS. GORELICK: Rather than rely then on your impressionistic
recollections of what you did, I would request for the record that we
receive from you and from your former colleagues at the FAA a detailed
description of the actions that were taken at the end of 1999 and a
detailed description of the actions that were taken in the spring and
summer of 2001. Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Commissioner Ben-Veniste.

MR. RICHRD BEN-VENISTE: Well, I think I'll start by simply observing
from my own personal view that this war on terrorism may or may not be
the right way to describe our efforts to combat a vicious, murderous
gang which did and continues to mean us harm. I don't know whether
elevating it to a war, in my own view, gives undue deference to these
bloodthirsty individuals and their methods and motivations. But let me
ask this question with respect to the important information that has
been developed this morning by my colleagues.

We're looking at a situation, at least as of July of 2001, where the FAA
itself has gone to the trouble of communicating a statement which is put
in the Federal Register. So that means that there was prior planning and
discussion until you get to the point of actually putting it in the
Federal Register, and that says on July 17, 2001, "Terrorism can occur
anytime and anywhere in the United States. Members of foreign terrorist
groups, representatives from state sponsors of terrorism, and radical
fundamentalist elements from many nations are present in the United
States."

You recognize that. "The activities of some of these individuals and
groups now include recruiting other persons for terrorist activities and
training them to use weapons and make bombs." And then you conclude,
"Thus, an increasing threat to civil aviation from both foreign sources
and potential domestic ones exists and needs to be prevented and/or
countered."

So that's the set as we move toward the 9/11 catastrophe. At the same
time, as we have pointed out and as Commissioner Gorelick has just very
eloquently pointed out, the point people in our intelligence community
have received and are reacting very strongly to a great deal of
intelligence information which is suggesting that some major event is
about to happen. While the primary focus was on the possibility of
striking U.S. interests overseas, they could not and did not rule out
the potential for activity in the United States of a terrorist nature.

So, you send out directives, but the question is who receives the
directives? What happens to the people on the line making the day-to-day
decisions that will implement these security measures? That's what I
find so hard to understand because nine of the hijackers are pulled out
for secondary screening.

Now, Admiral Flynn, you said that additional attention would be paid to
them if in fact they were found to be in possession of something
dangerous. Now, we've seen this morning this Leatherman tool which
contains blades of four inches and which has the ability to lock into
place. And the heft of this device is extremely heavy and provides
something other than a penknife and a lightweight handle for someone to
grasp. It's extremely sharp, it's just under four inches and the fact
that it locks into place is significant in terms of its utility as a
weapon, I think you'll concede that.

So when we are on such high alert, when there are advisories, when there
is a recognition that the potential for a domestic hijacking exists and
may be carried out by fundamentalist elements who have been tracked and
described and whose motivations have been categorized for years and
years, and then an individual in the screening process, seeing a young
Arab male carrying such a device, is not interviewed: What are you doing
with this? Where are you going? Who are you? How long have you been
here? The sort of common sense that we heard yesterday from an INS
officer, Jose Melendez.

But that was not done not once, not twice, nine times as people set off
magnetometers, which of course was the case we know with respect to at
least some of the hijackers. I don't understand how you could have all
of these directives and taking additional security measures when the
individuals who are conducting the security measures are not themselves
told to be alert and specifically for the type of people who you know,
on the basis of what you are saying yourselves, might be the ones to
carry out such terrorist acts. Admiral Flynn?

MR. FLYNN: With regard to people, we were under very strict guidelines
not to select people on the basis of ethnicity or national origin.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: But somebody of ethnicity who fits the description of
what you yourself regard as the principal threat domestically to airline
security, carrying a knife like this, does that not -- did that not at
that time at least warrant the individual conducting that security
measure to ask some questions?

MR. FLYNN: No.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Well, when you say that an individual carrying
something dangerous would in fact trigger a response, you would think,
for the collection of at least more information, what more could you
mean? That if he was carrying a hand grenade or an automatic weapon
certainly such a person would be placed immediately under arrest. But
isn't this a dangerous weapon?

MR. FLYNN: Yes, and there are other things that are dangerous. But the
menace that's conveyed by them is less than the innocent reasons for
having them in people's possession.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: But let me stop you there. When you say that the
possession of a dangerous article would warrant further scrutiny, if it
is a dangerous article that is prohibited, that's end of case. You're
under arrest, good-bye, good luck, off the plane. So -

MR. FLYNN: Well, not necessarily. By the way, not necessarily.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: A gun?

MR. FLYNN: Well, a gun, yes. By the way -

MR. BEN-VENISTE: An explosive device?

MR. FLYNN: Well, to be accurate, guns did not necessarily end in arrest.
Two thousand of them per year were taken away; the number of arrests was
in the hundreds.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: So that if -

MR. FLYNN: If I -

MR. BEN-VENISTE: If a young Arab male on 9/11 was found to be in the
possession of a handgun, you might suspect that that gun would be
confiscated but the individual allowed to proceed on his way?

MR. FLYNN: Unlikely. I mean, there would be a police interview. The
police would respond, and unlikely. But, for example, when congressmen
carry pistols through screening checkpoints, it may or may not lead to
their arrest.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: To the best of my knowledge none of these individuals
were members of Congress.

MR. FLYNN: No. But, Commissioner -

MR. BEN-VENISTE: I'm trying to understand what seems to me to be a
disconnect between your statement that an individual who is found in
possession of something dangerous and referred to secondary would be
subjected to greater scrutiny. We have no information as to whether
these individuals were in fact interviewed and the information seems to
point to the fact that they were not.

MR. FLYNN: No, the secondary screening is the secondary search of them
and their bags for objects. And in certain instances the -- in certain
positive indications of explosives, for example, is there an indication
that accounts for that? Interviews to that extent.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Would you not agree that the human factor could well
have played a role at these points of security, beginning to question
somebody about just the basics of where you're going, what are you
doing, what do you need this for, how long have you been here, and watch
for indications of erratic behavior or anomalies in the answers?

Commissioner Garvey?

MS. GARVEY: Commissioner, as I listen to you and consider the situation
as you have outlined it, it is discouraging and certainly heartbreaking
to think that the security directives went out, the information
circulars and perhaps, as you've indicated, the human element came into
play. Certainly the testimony that you heard, that this commission heard
yesterday, of the border guard and the real, I think, thoughtfulness and
carefulness with which he approached his job, you would certainly hope
that we could have had that same outcome on the aviation side. So I
think you're right in saying that and I would agree.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Thank you. With respect to, Mr. Manno, your statement
that, in a sense, the classification of information, the security
sensitive information, was a bar to the dissemination of the information
to you and your colleagues is, again, very troubling to us. The idea
that we spend all the time and effort and treasure to acquire
information that may be useful, and yet that information is not provided
to the individuals -- or was not then provided to the individuals and
agencies who would be in a position to utilize that information is
extremely distressing.

And I'll finish with making an observation about a point that, Admiral
Flynn, you mentioned, and that is the restrictions on the FBI
dissemination of material because it may be grand jury material. Now,
this has always bugged me because I have quite a bit of personal
experience with grand jury material and with the rule 6E of the Federal
Rules that requires that such information be held confidential. The
purpose for that rule is to assure the confidentiality of witness
testimony and that individuals who are called before a grand jury can
feel confident that their testimony will not, other than through the
appropriate legal means, make its way into the public arena.

However, it seems to me the exception, in my experience -and I feel
pretty strongly about this -- that information is generated only by the
grand jury when there is a grand jury investigation. In the normal
course of events, the FBI has that information through interviews and is
in possession of that information entirely apart from the grand jury
process. And the utilization of such information which is acquired
perhaps through dual means, once through investigation and secondarily
through testimony in a grand jury, does not somehow then take that
information out of the public realm simply because it has been repeated
in a grand jury. That is, if the FBI has valuable information which it
has uncovered in the course of an investigation, rule 6E does not
somehow provide an amulet for the refusal to disseminate that
information to those who are entitled to get it. Do you have any comment
on that, Admiral?

MR. FLYNN: Yes. Not being a lawyer, I am -- I probably put far too much
emphasis on the protection of grand jury information as the reason for
not giving us more detailed information.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Well, we have heard that explanation from time-to-time
and I felt that your reference to it perhaps entitled us to comment with
respect to it.

Mr. Chairman, thank you.

MR. KEAN: Thank you, commissioner.

Commissioner Fielding and then our last questioner will be Senator
Gorton.

MR. FRED F. FIELDING: I guess I will address this to the entire panel.
We obviously have to draw our conclusions as to the adequacy of the
baseline security, the adequacy of intelligence and the adequacy of
intelligence that's been shared and how it was shared, and basically the
adequacy of the FAA's actions, your performance. But when we're doing
our total evaluation of all this, I want you to help us to be sure that
we have reviewed all the elements that are extant. And in that regard,
and I'm sure certainly dealing with pre-9/11 at this point, if you ever
felt you needed to add to your baseline of security, did you have to
deal with or was there reaction from either the airline industry or
Congress or both? And I'd appreciate any comments you have.

MS. GARVEY: Commissioner, I'll begin and obviously other panel members
will contribute as well. In the five years that I was there as
commissioner from '97 to 2001, if the question is was there sort of
direct lobbying either by the airlines or by Congress on any specific --
either safety or security, the answer would be no. But was I aware of
great differences that, for example, the airlines may have had to an
approach to an issue? Absolutely, and I knew that from the rule-making
process and the public docket and the number of comments that we would
get on rules.

I knew that from individual conversations with people within the
industry. And certainly before my time I know that there had been
attempts, for example on criminal background checks and legislation had
been restrictive in that area to the FAA. So very much aware of the
differences and conscious of them, but still I hope having the ability
to listen to those respectfully but to make what we thought was the
right decision.

I would like to go back, if I could, to the July 17 citing because it
has been mentioned a couple of times on the rule-making for 107 and 108.
And I mention this because this really is a good example; 107 and 108
really provided the framework for both the airports and the airlines to
develop a security program and it reflected what we believed were new
threats and so forth. It was a very important rule from the FAA's
perspective. It had taken far too long, and part of that is I think
probably somewhat legitimate because you have a public process, and we
had many, many comments, all of which we felt we had to respond to.

And the comment that has been -- or the language -- and it's absolutely
accurate and I remember it well because I was there. The language that
refers to the domestic threat was put in, in part, because (a) we did
recognize it. Doesn't mean we had specific -- any specific information,
but we recognized it. And we were so eager to get that rule out we felt
we needed to put the best case forward. But certainly if you look at the
history of 107 or 108, it is illustrative I think of the concerns that
sometimes industry would raise and some may be legitimate, but it
certainly slows down the process.

MR. FIELDING: Mr. Flynn?

MR. FLYNN: Specific interventions by the Congress, don't do this, or
something -- a rider in an appropriation saying, we will not fund you if
you do this, did not happen in my time. With regard to the air carriers
and the airports requiring additional measures, I do not recall a
specific one where we put forward a rule and they flat refused to do it.
Rule-making was the process under which those things had to be brought
into consideration and they -- and we were not the only arbiters of
that. Other agencies, particularly the OMB, took into consideration the
-that which the agency wanted to do and that which took other matters
into consideration.

MR. FIELDING: Mr. Manno?

MR. MANNO: I really can't comment on -- in terms of possible pressure
from the Congress. But as far as the airlines, from an intelligence
perspective, sometimes there was some skepticism about whether or not
there really was a threat and was it really the way that we were telling
it to them. But all in all, when we brought them in -- and as an example
of that, in the mid '90s we invited in all the corporate security
directors, airport directors and they got a classified briefing by CIA
and FBI on the threat in the United States and went away believers that
after 1994 things had changed, that terrorism had actually come to this
country, it wasn't just something overseas. And I think that after that
time there was a little bit more acceptance by the airlines that, you
know, what we were telling them was right and it was the best assessment
that we could provide them.

MR. FIELDING: Okay. But I gather from that then that your collective
answer is that if we find fault in any way -- and I say "if" -- with the
FAA, there is no other person that's going to take the blame for it?
You're not going to say, I was forced to do it for this or for that or
for some other reason? Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. KEAN: Senator Gorton. And we're running a little close on time.

MR. GORTON: Not very long.

Ms. Garvey, one of the first and most dramatic physical security changes
that you made after 9/11 was to -- not only to lock the doors to where
the pilots are, but to see to it that they were secure and couldn't be
broken down. Was that measure ever seriously considered before 9/11?

MS. GARVEY: The issue of the hardened doors, commissioner, is a good
example where the agency and safety and intelligence experts manage
risks. In the case of the hardened doors, the greater concern had always
been historically that there was an issue of decompression. So in fact
the agency had looked at the issue of hardened doors and it pre-dated me
and I won't give the exact -- we can certainly provide it, the exact
timeline but it had looked at it. But the overriding concern was
decompression, which was the safety issue, and it was not at that time a
door that dealt both with decompression and with security. At the same
time, though, there was tremendous discussion and work going on between
the FAA and the manufacturers to try to figure out could we do a door.

MR. GORTON: Well, to be perfectly candid with you, I find that a dubious
explanation. Wasn't the reason that the overall policy with respect to
hijacking was that you would cooperate and even -

MS. GARVEY: That was the -

MR. GORTON: -- if you had had a secure door, if they'd taken a flight
attendant up to that door with a knife to her throat, you would have
opened the door anyway? So isn't that really the reason?

MS. GARVEY: Well, that's a very good point and that was certainly part
of it, that the whole -- and I think this was mentioned earlier, the
strategy was negotiation so it wasn't -

MR. GORTON: So that it wouldn't have stopped the traditional form of
hijacking. All right. Now, the rule on hardened doors took place while
you were still administrator, did it not?

MS. GARVEY: Yes, it did.

MR. GORTON: What is today the rule with respect to such a hijacking?
Let's assume that someone gets onboard with a knife, you know, they
manage to get through security, they take a flight attendant, get up to
the door and put a knife to her neck and say, open the door or I'm going
to slit her throat. What is the present requirement of the pilots and
the crew in the cockpit?

MS. GARVEY: Commissioner, I'm a little hesitant to answer that because
it may be some security issue.

MR. KEAN: Yes, I think that's the area we'd planned not to get into,
Senator.

MR. GORTON: All right. Okay, I will withdraw that question.

MS. GARVEY: Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Last quick question, Commissioner Lehman, and then we'll -

MR. LEHMAN: Thank you. I can only shake my head in disbelief at the
naiveté of many of the statements that have been made here this morning.

And, Ms. Garvey, when you say you're unaware of any lobbying that the
industry has done against these measures, I find that astounding because
our record is very different. Our information is that there was very
active airline lobbying against not only

\- not only against specific rule-making but OMB, against the
implementation and funding of certain safety measures they disagreed
with, that they played a very significant part in the disappearance of
the marshal program that was instituted during the Reagan
administration, that they played a very significant role in the eroding
of the locked cockpit doors and the single key, that they played a very
significant role in the disbanding or at least diminution of the Red
Teams which repeatedly showed that their security, their implementation
of screening was a farce. Every Red Team got through nearly 100 percent
of the measures and these reports were very embarrassing, led to fines.

The efforts that they made to see that there were no teeth allowed in
FAA enforcement, that the fines were enforced at an average 10 percent.
How can you sit there and say that the airlines were not lobbying? What
are they paying these high priced lobbyists for, if not to do exactly
that? I'm just amazed.

But I'd like to hear Admiral Flynn, who has a very significant
reputation for not being a yes man and not being a pushover. He's a Navy
Seal and he's accomplished a great deal inside of bureaucracy. What
happened to the Red Teams? The records that we have show that a lot of
these problems were identified 10 years ago by Red Teams and reports
were sent. Now, earlier, Ms. Garvey, you said you never saw a direct Red
Team report while you were in the job. What happened to them?

Admiral Flynn, could you respond both to the lobbying issue and the Red
Team issue?

MR. FLYNN: Yeah. Doubtless, there was a lot of lobbying going on. I'm
here to tell you the truth as I see it and I took the tenor of the
question to be, do you know of an instance where you wanted to do
something where the airlines fixed it so you couldn't? And I don't know.
And, similarly, do you know one where the Congress fixed it so you
couldn't? And I don't know of that either. That deals with the first.

With regard to the Red Team, the Red Team is an enormously valuable
asset to the FAA and to aviation security in totality and they did a
whole lot of great work and were an invaluable part of my organization.
What happened to them? They were still in existence when I left and were
still doing good work when I left, and the members of the Red Team were
appreciated, promoted, rewarded, and I think that had it not been for
them, a lot of the things that we implemented would not have been
because we wouldn't have known with the specificity necessary to
approach rule-making or really to understand the problem.

MS. GARVEY: Commissioner, if I could, just to be very clear, was I aware
that lobbying was going on? Of course, and your statement in that regard
is correct. I think the question was: Was I directly lobbied to do
something that I didn't feel was appropriate? And I want to be clear
that that was not the case. And in terms of the Red Team, Commissioner,
Admiral Flynn is absolutely right. The Red Team made invaluable
contributions, as did the I.G., as did the GAO, to changes in protocols,
to changes in training. The purpose of the Red Team was to take us to
the next level. And while I may not have received or read in detail a
Red Team report, I was certainly briefed on it.

I think the IG's criticism of the FAA, and one which we agreed with, was
that we as an agency and perhaps as a management team had not been
giving the Red Team enough feedback as to the specific results of the
work that they had done: What protocols had been changed, what training
requirements had been changed. And to his credit, General Canavan and
the deputy in the summer of 2001 held what I'm sure would have, but for
9/11, been the first in a series of debriefs, if you will, to the Red
Team. That was a legitimate issue raised by the IG and one we took
seriously. Thank you, sir.

MR. KEAN: Okay. Thank you all very much. We appreciate very much your
attendance here and your helpfulness to our panel and the country. Thank
you all very, very much.

I'd like members of the Commission -- we're going to have a very
important meeting now and we'll convene again here at 1:00.

(Lunch recess.)

MR. KEAN: At this point we're going to reconvene the hearing. The events
of 9/11 were a great tragedy for the nation, taking the lives of nearly
3,000 innocent civilians and forever changing the lives, of course, of
those who they left behind. The events of that day were also a
catastrophe for the airlines. The planes were used in the attack and
many of their employees perished, along with the passengers that they
served. Air travel remains an absolutely vital part of American life and
of our economy. The airline industry is a tough business with many
operational challenges. It functions in a high-profile public
environment in a dangerous world and has many responsibilities.

The first and foremost of these responsibilities is the safety and
security of the passengers and the aircraft. Secure air travel is a
matter of law. Air carriers are legally responsible for implementing
specific security functions according to standards and procedures
established and enforced by the federal government. Means by which the
airlines are required to carry out their duties are detailed in an FAA
approved Air Carrier Standard Security Program. The airlines were
responsible for the safety of their passengers, and for implementing key
aspects of the civil aviation security system. On September 11th, that
system failed, and we are charged by statute to find out why.

Our next panel represents key executives representing United and
American Airlines. From United Airlines we have Mr. Andy Studdert. Is
that right?

MR. ANDREW P. STUDDERT: Studdert.

MR. KEAN: Studdert -- who is chief operating officer, and Mr. Ed
Soliday, vice president of safety, quality assurance and security. With
us from American Airlines are Gerard Arpey, who on 9/11 was the
airline's executive vice president of operations, and Mr. Timothy Ahern,
who served as the airline's vice president of safety, security and
environmental affairs.

We thank you very much for taking the time to be with us today and to
help us with our inquiry. And, Mr. Arpey, we'll begin with you.

MR. GERARD J. ARPEY: Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice Chairman and
members of the Commission. My name is Gerard Arpey and I am president
and chief executive officer of AMR Corporation and American Airlines.

MR. KEAN: Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Counsel reminds me what I didn't do is
ask you to stand and raise your right hand.

(Witnesses sworn.)

Thank you very much.

Mr. Arpey, I apologize.

MR. ARPEY: Yes, sir. I am also a member of AMR's board of directors. I
am joined here today by Tim Ahern, who is currently the vice president
in charge of our Dallas-Fort Worth hub. On September 11th, 2001, Tim was
the vice president of safety, security and environmental for American
Airlines. In that capacity, he was responsible for American security
department and reported directly to Robert Baker, now deceased, who was
the Vice Chairman of the company at that time. Tim and I both thank the
Commission for this opportunity to represent AMR and American Airlines.

September 11th was, without a doubt, the worst day in the long storied
history of American Airlines, and one of the worst in the history of the
United States. While the horror and shock of that day may have abated
somewhat during the past two and a half years, the sadness endures.
Twenty-three members of the American Airlines family died that day, as
well as 18 members of the United Airlines family. We continue to grieve
their loss and our hearts continue to go out to their families and to
the families of the passengers and individuals on the ground who were
killed or inured that day. We also grieve with the families of the
fire-fighters, police officers, rescue workers and military personnel
who made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our country safe.

September 11th was a day of horror but it was also a day of heroes.
Later today you will hear from one of our reservation specialists, Nydia
Gonzalez, who will tell you about her telephone call with Betty Ong, an
American Airlines flight attendant on Flight 11. The courage summoned by
Betty, Nydia and so many others that day has both inspired us and
strengthened our resolve to do whatever it takes to ensure that nothing
like 9/11 ever happens again. We commend the work of the Commission and
we have been assisting in your investigation. We have furnished the
Commission with thousands of pages of documents, provided briefings to
the Commission staff members about ground security and in-flight
security training and procedures, and made numerous company employees
available for interviews. American Airlines stands ready to further
assist the Commission as it completes its investigation.

At American Airlines, the security of our passengers and crew is first
and foremost in any decision we make. It is the foundation of our
success and a core value of our airline. This commission has already
heard a considerable amount of testimony about the roles of the
government and industry in the aviation security system in the pre-9/11
environment. So I will not belabor the point here. Suffice to say that,
at that time, the FAA set the security standards for U.S. airports, U.S.
airlines and foreign carriers flying into the United States.

The FAA also ensured compliance with those standards and through its
Office of Civil Aviation Security conducted aviation threat and risk
analysis in collaboration with U.S. intelligence and law enforcement
agencies. We, at American, along with other

U.S. carriers, were responsible for implementing the system that the FAA
designed and enforced. Today we continue to rely on the FAA, the TSA and
other U.S. government agencies for threat assessments and the
formulation of industry security strategy as well as the design of
countermeasures to meet those threats.

The civil aviation industry did not foresee the type of attacks that
took place on September 11th. It is clear that the security system was
not designed to deal with coordinated, suicidal hijack teams with the
ability to use commercial aircraft as weapons of mass destruction.

On September 11th, 2001, I was the executive vice president of
operations for American Airlines. In that role, I was responsible for
American's worldwide flight operations in addition to having
responsibility for several of our business units, including our cargo
division and American Eagle Airlines, AMR's wholly-owned commuter
carrier. Accordingly, I was directly involved in American's emergency
response efforts and other operational decisions made at American
Airlines as the terrible events of September 11th unfolded.

On September 11th, I arrived at my office at company headquarters in
Fort Worth at about 7:15 a.m. Central Time. Because of another pressing
business matter, at approximately

7:30 a.m. Central Time, I called our systems operation control center,
also known as SOC to advise them that I would not be able to participate
in our system-wide operations conference call, which is held at 7:45
a.m. each day. Joe Burdepelly, one of our SOC managers, answered the
phone. Joe told me that he had just tried to page me because we had a
possible hijacking on Flight 11, one of our transcontinental flights.

Flight 11 was a Boeing 767 that was scheduled to fly nonstop from Boston
to Los Angeles and which had taken off from Logan Airport at about 7:00
a.m. Central Time. Joe told me that the SOC manager on duty, Craig
Marquis was in contact with Betty Ong, one of our flight attendants on
Flight 11. Betty Ong's courage and professionalism that day made her one
of the first real heroes of September 11th and you will hear more about
Betty later today. Betty's family is represented today by her brother,
Harry Ong, and her sister, Cathy Ong-Herrera. We are proud that Betty
was also a member of our family at American Airlines and we will always
remember her.

Betty was located in the rear of the aircraft and she had called our
Raleigh North Carolina Reservations Center. After the aircraft was
hijacked, Nydia Gonzalez, an operations specialist, answered the call.
She then called the company emergency line, which rings into the SOC in
Fort Worth. Nydia was relaying information about Flight 11 from Betty
Ong to our SOC manager on duty, Craig Marquis. As I said, you will meet
Nydia this afternoon and learn about the important role she played that
day. I understand that you will hear a portion of the telephone call
between Betty and Nydia. I am sure you will be moved by Betty's
remarkable poise and by how calm and reassuring Nydia was throughout
this most difficult call.

From Betty we leaned that two of our flight attendants had been stabbed,
one of them with serious wounds, that two or three passengers were in
the cockpit and that our pilots were not responding to intercom calls
from the flight attendants. After talking with the SOC, I then called
Don Carty, the president and chief executive officer of American
Airlines at that time. He had not arrived at his office yet and I left a
message for him to call me as soon as possible. I briefed my executive
assistant of what I had just learnt and then I headed to our SOC
facility located about a mile from our company headquarters.

I arrived at the SOC between approximately 7:35 and 7:40

a.m. Central Time. Our SOC managers told me that they were now treating
Flight 11 as a confirmed hijacking. I was told that the flight deck was
still not responding to calls by our flight attendants. Betty Ong had
also told us that one of the passengers in first class had been stabbed,
possibly fatally. We also were receiving information from the FAA that
instead of heading west on its intended flight path, Flight 11 was
headed south. Also our pilots were not responding to air traffic control
or company radio calls and the aircraft transponder had been turned off.

In accordance with our emergency response plan, our SOC managers were
activating American's command center which is a dedicated crisis
response facility located on the floor above and overlooking our SOC
floor. From the reports we were receiving, we believed that Flight 11
might be headed for the New York area, possibly to land at Kennedy or
Newark Airport. Craig Marquis and Nydia Gonzalez maintained telephone
contact with Betty Ong and we also attempted to monitor the progress of
the flight via communications with the FAA and their traffic control
officials.

In the command center, we focused on trying to gather as much
information about Flight 11 as we could. As far as we knew, the rest of
our airline was operating normally at this point. At approximately 7:48
Central Time, we learned that an aircraft had crashed into one of the
towers of the World Trade Center. We furiously attempted to learn if
that aircraft was Flight 11. As you may recall, some earlier media
reports indicated that the plane that had struck the building may have
been a smaller aircraft but we, nonetheless, feared the worst.

By this time, we had lost telephone contact with Betty Ong and the
contact had not been reestablished. During this time, Don Carty called
me in the command center and asked if our aircraft was the one that had
hit the World Trade Center. I told him what information we had and I
said I didn't know for sure if the airplane was ours. While trying to
confirm whether the aircraft that had hit the World Trade Center was
Flight 11, we learned from air traffic control officials that another
one of our flights, Flight 77, was not responding to radio calls and not
emitting a transponder signal, and that air traffic control could not
determine its location.

Flight 77 had taken off from Dulles Airport at approximately

7:20 a.m. Central Time and was a Boeing 757 scheduled to fly to Los
Angeles. Having learned this and while still trying to determine the
fate of Flight 11, at approximately 8:00 a.m. Central Time, we issued an
order to ground stop, all American and American Eagle flights in the
northeast quarter of the United States that had not yet taken off. A few
minutes later, at approximately 8:05 Central Time, we learned that
United Airlines had lost communication with one of their aircraft.

Upon hearing this, we immediately made the decision to ground stop the
entire American Airlines and American Eagle system. There would be no
more American or American Eagle takeoffs until we could sort out
everything that was happening.

Shortly thereafter, we learned that a second aircraft had hit the World
Trade Center. At that time, we believed that the second aircraft to
crash into the center may have been Flight 77. continued to confer with
our SOC and other operational managers and we agreed that we ought to
get every -- all of our aircraft on the deck immediately.

At this point, Don Carty arrived at the command center. I explained the
situation to Don and without hesitation, he agreed that we should divert
all airborne American and American Eagle flights to the nearest suitable
airports. This occurred at about

8:15 a.m. Central Time. A short time later, we received word that the
FAA had shut down the entire airspace over the United States to all
traffic except military aircraft. We then received word in the command
center that an aircraft had crashed into the Pentagon. It was not until
some time later that we learned that it was our Flight 77.

American employees spent the next several hours successfully landing the
remainder of our flights and trying to learn as much as we could about
Flights 11 and 77. By about 10:50 a.m. Central Time, the remainder of
American's domestic aircraft were accounted for and on the ground. Of
course, it took longer to land our international and trans-Pacific
flights. Many of our international flights returned to their points of
departure while other American aircraft landed in Canada and various
airports around the world.

For the remainder of the day, our employees worked to respond to the
monumental logistical challenges that arose from the decision to shut
down the entire U.S. civil aviation system. Our efforts in the command
center also focused on providing assistance to the FBI and other law
enforcement officials who were investigating the attacks. Our next
scheduled flights did not take place until several days after September
11th, and we did not have a full flight schedule for several more days.
Our command center remained open 24 hours a day for the next two weeks,
until September 24th.

It was only weeks later, as we returned to some normal level of
activity, that we were able to step back and try to comprehend the
impact that these horrific events had on our country, our company and on
our families. We continue to grieve for our brave employees, our
passengers, and all of the families who were victims of these horrendous
attacks.

As we continue to pursue our mission of providing safe, secure air
travel to our passengers, the events of September 11th are a constant
reminder of the need for vigilance and resolve.

All of us at American Airlines applaud this commission and the work it
is doing to examine what happened on 9/11, what we can learn from it,
and how we can apply the lessons of that day to make air travel in our
country ever safer and more secure. This concludes my opening remarks.
Thank you very much and we'll be happy to answer your questions at the
appropriate point.

MR. KEAN: Thank you.

Mr. Studdert.

MR. ANDY STUDDERT: Mr. Chairman, distinguished panel members, I
appreciate the opportunity to be here with you today. I'm very proud to
be joined by Captain Ed Soliday, who is United's vice president of
safety, security and quality assurance from 1991 through 2002.

The September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States
were first and foremost personal tragedies. My heart and the hearts of
all of us at United go out to the victims and their families. This was
also a profoundly personal loss for all of us at United, as I know it
was for our colleagues at American. Eighteen of those who died that day
were our coworkers, friends and family members, and 76 of them were our
innocent passengers. All of us who were affected applaud and support the
work of this commission. I know that United will do its part to clarify
the events of September 11th and to help improve our nation's security
system.

I would like to cover three main areas today. First, the roles of
government and airlines in our security system and United's commitment
to security. Second, a review of the events of 9/11 as we experienced
them at United. And third, some brief recommendations that the
Commission might consider.

Both the United States government and the aviation industry play vital
roles in aviation security. As the Commission knows, the United States
government has been and must be the central player in aviation security.
The airlines in turn must work hard to implement government directives
as quickly as possible and to provide the government our feedback on the
practicalities and effectiveness of those measures. We at United strive
to be a constructive, active and innovative participant in the system.

United's commitment to security is an integral part of the company's
culture. The foundation of our work is anchored in the safety of those
who put their trust when they choose to fly United. The central
importance of safety and security is reflected in our corporate
structure and organization. United has a high level executive vice
president of safety, security and quality assurance, with true
independence from the operating units of the company. This VP has direct
access to the chief executive officer, the head of operations, and very
importantly, to United's board of directors.

Since its inception, this position has always been filled by a highly
experienced senior captain. We take pride in the fact that our safety
and security staff have been asked to serve on a broad spectrum of
safety advisory boards -- security advisory boards. Fundamentally,
United's approach is to be part of the security solution. With United's
commitments to security as background, let me recount what happened at
United, September 11th, 2001.

Started as a normal day -- by the way, all my times are in Eastern
times, from a confusion standpoint, so I'll make it a point up front. We
had more than 120 domestic planes and 27 international aircraft in the
air and more than 40 flights waiting to take off. At 8:14, United Flight
175, Boston to Los Angeles, under the command of Captain Victor
Saracini, was wheeled up. United Flight 93, Newark to San Francisco,
under the command of Captain Jason Dahl, was wheeled up at 8:42.

Shortly before 9:00, I was having my usual morning meeting with Jim
Goodwin, then United's CEO, when my secretary burst into the room with a
report from our operations center that a plane had hit the World Trade
Center. I immediately left Goodwin's office and ran to our operations
center in our world headquarters. What follows is a timeline of the
events that happened that day at United.

At around 8:50, a call came into our San Francisco maintenance center
from a flight attendant on Flight 175 saying that the flight had been
hijacked. This information was quickly relayed to our Chicago operations
center. At approximately 9:00, a United dispatcher reported that he had
lost contact with Flight 175. At 9:03, a second plane hit the World
Trade Center. American reported that they believed it was another one of
their aircraft. We later learned it was United Flight 175, with 60
people on board.

As detailed in our emergency response plan, our SOC managers activated
our crisis center. This action triggered the mobilization of more than
3,000 United employees, who serve as or support our "Go" teams, which
assist victims' families and the authorities. We contacted the local
FBI. They responded immediately with a team who had been trained in the
use of United's computer systems and had practiced emergency response
with United on several occasions. Throughout the morning, we were in
constant contact via hotlines with the government agencies and other
airlines.

At 9:21, United dispatchers were told to advise their flights to secure
cockpit doors. At 9:24, a United dispatcher sent a message to Flight 93
reading "Beware of cockpit intrusion. Two aircraft in New York hit Trade
Center buildings." Flight 93 responded to this message at 9:26,
requesting that the dispatcher confirm the message. Despite numerous
attempts to reach it, that was the last time we heard from the cockpit
of Flight 93. At approximately 9:30, after discussions with our
operating managers, the decision was made to ground United's fleet. At
9:35, San Francisco maintenance center received another call from flight
attendant on Flight 93 saying that the flight had been hijacked. Again,
this information was passed quickly to our ops center.

At approximately 9:45, the order to ground the fleet went to all the
aircraft in the air. And even before this, some of our individual
dispatchers had already started grounding flights under their control.
Again at 9:45, we received a report that an aircraft had crashed into
the Pentagon. We later learned that it was Flight 77, American. We
tracked Flight 93's flight path on the large operations center --
operations monitor in our crisis center. At 10:00 the blip stopped. At
around 10:00 we lost contact with United's Flights 641, 415 and 399.
After persistent attempts, communications to these missing flights was
reestablished.

At approximately 10:06, United Flight 93 crashed in Pennsylvania,
killing all 41 on board. At 10:20, we received confirmation from the
airport manager in Johnstown, Pennsylvania that Flight 93 had indeed
crashed. Throughout that morning, we were dealing with a flood of
information and issues. We were unable to establish contact with nearly
a dozen flights. There were torrents of bomb reports, reports of two
explosions at airports, reports of other threats and other hijackings.
The threats fortunately turned out to be misunderstandings or hoaxes,
and we eventually reached the flights. But nothing could be dismissed or
ignored in the high uncertainty of the moment.

United's crisis center remained in operations 24 hours a day, seven days
a week for nearly three weeks, until we returned to more or less a
normal operation. During those days and beyond, United's people all
around the country devoted their energies to assisting the victims'
families and working with the FBI and other government agencies to
assist in the investigation.

In the wake of these attacks and all that has transpired, the question
rightly is: What changes should be made to enhance aviation security?
First we must recognize that great progress has been made since
September 11th, 2001, some of which can be seen, and much I know cannot
be seen, and we commend the FAA, the TSA and other bodies for all their
efforts. We believe that national aviation security system can and
should evolve further. Most fundamentally, there needs to be a vision, a
goal, for what the security system in this country should ultimately
look like.

We believe there are several key aspects of that vision some of which we
know are already underway. First, customer disruption should be kept to
a minimum. The security system should be as transparent as possible to
them. Second, the system should be fully integrated with the overall
aviation structure in the country. It must be dynamic, flexible and
unpredictable to our enemies and must improve continuously. The system
must not depend on any single element. Its strength must come from a
combination of integrated elements.

There must be full participation from, and communications among, all the
different entities in aviation security. No one organization has a
monopoly on good ideas. Lastly, the system should focus on a risk-based
approach, in addition to today's threat based emphasis. Under a risk
based approach, root cause analysis is used to identify the factors
underlying multiple risks, and then they are cut off even if they don't
pose an immediate threat.

Mr. Chairman, in closing I return to where I began, to the victims and
their families. Let us work together to learn as much as possible about
the events of September 11th. We must then apply those lessons to make
our nation's security system continually better and stronger so that our
enemies do not ever attack our country and its people though the
aviation system. I thank the Commission again for all it's doing to
advance this cause and Captain Soliday and I will welcome any questions
you may have.

Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Thank you very much.

Senator Kerrey?

MR. KERREY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I apologize in the interest of
time. We started late and there's a very important issue alluded to a
moment ago that this commission will have an opportunity to participate
in at 3:30, so I will try to go as quickly as I can and I'll have some
additional questions, if you don't mind, that you could perhaps answer
in writing.

First of all, I want to thank you for coming. You didn't have to and I
suspect, especially in your case, Mr. Arpey, that your lawyers may have
advised you not to, so I appreciate very much your coming here and
trying to help us to get the full and complete accounting that we are
tasked as a consequence of the legislation that created this commission.

It's also important to say that you weren't just selected by us because
you can help us. From the standpoint of American and United as a company
you suffered in a personal way but you also suffered in an economic way
and you can help us, because you perhaps in America no companies -- no
two companies have a greater sense of urgency to understand both what
happened and what do we need today to make sure it doesn't happen again.

But you were selected by the conspirators, and one of the things -- and
I'm going to try to make this point slightly different than I've made
before. The people who perpetrated these acts on the 11th September,
they don't feel remorse, they don't feel shame. They didn't target the
pilot, they weren't going after somebody and then accidentally killed
some additional people as a consequence. They were trying to kill as
many as possible. It's a religious beginning. I don't believe all
Muslims by any extent believe this. I don't see all Muslims this way at
all, this is an extreme form of Islam. But it does -- it is a religious
belief and it's not new, it didn't spring at us in 2001, although the
risk grew considerably in 2001.

Usama bin Laden had began with a relationship actually with us in
Afghanistan, but he declared in 1998 a fatwa and my guess is 19
participants responded to that fatwa and participated as a consequence.
And I think it's very important to understand that because we continue
to put this word terrorism over the top of this for some reason that's
beyond my reach, and I think it makes it difficult for us both to
understand the why and more importantly the what do we need to do.

And I would like to begin by asking you, perhaps if you, Mr. Arpey,
first and you, Mr. Ahern, because you had some significant response in
this area, what's your understanding of the law, of the 44902 section of
U.S. Code Title 49. Seems to be very specific that you have the
responsibility as well as the authority to refuse to transport people
that you consider to be at risk to the passengers on the airline. I
mean, do you believe you have under that law a responsibility to prevent
or do you believe your responsibility is merely to deter?

MR. ARPEY: Maybe I could start and Tim could jump in. I think, Senator,
the important thing to remember in both a pre-9/11 and even in a
post-9/11 world is that the airlines are responsible for implementing
the security procedures that are given to us by the federal government
who have the ability to make the threat assessments, take all of this
intelligence data, take that information, put it through whatever
intelligence sources are necessary and turn it into a security paradigm
on which we can implement.

And in the pre-9/11 environment that's what we had done. And I think we
were good stewards in the pre-9/11 environment in terms of doing what we
were asked to do, but as I said in my introductory remarks, nobody
anticipated that the type of threat that we encountered on the morning
of September 11th.

MR. KERREY: Let me press that a bit because National Security Advisor
Rice made a very famous statement in which she said nobody could have
predicted this. I disagree with that. I mean I absolutely disagree with
that. I mean you're talking and I presume that you've got safety
precautions dealing with a plane that's fully loaded of 70,000 pounds of
jet fuel that you consider it to be dangerous, all but itself as a
consequence of having the flammable material on it. I presume that
you've got procedures to deal with a pilot or two pilots that might wig
out and I presume you've got procedures to screen your own pilots to
make sure that something terrible doesn't happen.

And you may not have been able to say, oh my God, maybe suicide is going
to be a part of this thing, but it -- even there, I must say given what
was going on again and the Islamic extremist groups they were using
suicide technology. I mean, they were using the technology of suicide to
accomplish their objectives increasingly. So, I mean, even there I must
say I have a difficult time with an argument, gee, nobody could have
predicted this, because I think if we're thinking about you know, trying
to prevent all instances like this, it seems to me that that would have
been on the list.

MR. ARPEY: Well again, Senator, I'll just be candid with you. If you go
back to the morning of 9/11, the entire security paradigm that was in
place given to us by the FAA did not anticipate this type of threat.

MR. KERREY: You keep saying that it's the FAA that's telling you about
it. I must tell you that the law doesn't mention the FAA. The law says,
quote, "An air carrier may refuse to transport a passenger or property
the carrier decides is or might be inimical to safety." End of quote. It
doesn't mention the FAA at all. And it -- I mean, let me -- I presume
that you're familiar with the list of prohibited passengers -

MR. ARPEY: Yes, sir.

MR. KERREY: And that you have to implement that?

MR. ARPEY: Yes.

MR. KERREY: And do you have any -- do you participate in that? Do you
say, gee, the list is too small, the list is too big -- I mean, I'm down
on talking about pre-911, there were -wait a minute, we've been given a
list of 15 people at least by

\- at least on the surface it looks like 13 of them were in some way
connected with Islamic extremism.

MR. ARPEY: Well, I think -- and Tim, jump in here -- but that list I
think came out of the FAA's own threat assessment of what the industry
should be trying to protect itself against, and they came up with that
list and on the basis of that list we put in procedures to screen.

MR. KERREY: Any of you at the -- I think it was April or May 2000
briefing that the FAA security people did with airline officials? I
don't -

MR. SOLIDAY: My staff was.

MR. KERREY: Were you there, Ed?

MR. SOLIDAY: No, I wasn't but my staff was.

MR. KERREY: And what did they report back to you? Have you seen that
CD-ROM presentation?

MR. SOLIDAY: Yes. Yes, I have.

MR. KERREY: Did you see it prior to 9/11?

MR. SOLIDAY: Probably, I'm very familiar with it, yes. Could I build -

MR. KERREY: Sure.

MR. SOLIDAY: -- Senator Kerrey, on your question? The law that you talk
about, quite frankly when you read it as you do, it would presume that
the burden is upon the carrier. But if I could share some history with
you, how that law has been applied to us is that when we have tried to
deny boarding -- most recently after 9/11, 38 of our captains denied
boarding to people they thought were a threat. Those people filed
complaints with the DOT, we were sued, and we were asked not to do it
again.

So the burden upon us was to only take those people off of the flight
who we knew posed a threat and the only way we can know that they pose a
threat is through those who identify them. Quite frankly, at United and
I know at American, in the mid-'90s there were customers who assaulted
our passengers. We created our own list of those people who committed
violent acts on our airplanes to keep them off the airplane. We were
reminded quite frequently that unless they posed an immediate threat we
were disobeying the common carrier rules.

MR. KERREY: If you just take the first and -- in April of 2000, April
24, 2000, Security Directive 95 comes up. I presume you're familiar with
this, if not I can show you the list as well, have you seen this list?

MR. SOLIDAY: Yes, I'm familiar with the list.

MR. KERREY: So you've got six guys on here -

MR. SOLIDAY: Right.

MR. KERREY: -- all of whom have some relationship with Ramzi Yousef.

MR. SOLIDAY: Right.

MR. KERREY: So you get the list, what do you do about that?

MR. SOLIDAY: There are a number of things we do with it, some of them I
think I would prefer to discuss in a private session because those are
part of the procedures today, but those lists were distributed not only
to the field as a list, because six names is pretty easy to manage, I
might -- you probably know already, Senator, that that list grew to over
1,800 within a week. Managing that becomes much more complex.

Those names are fairly easy. Many, many people have common names in, and
what becomes very, very complex is if we have someone who's name -- to
use a generic name is John Smith, and we have a list that says deny
boarding to John Smith, and quite frankly, the Arab names are repeated
very, very frequently, then we may have 500 or 600 people with that name
on any given day.

Now, we have to be able to, in a very short timeframe, identify which
one is the one on the list. And so as the list grows, the handling of
that -- you can do some of it with computer services, but much of it has
to be done with hand phone lines and so forth. Now, there are
contingencies in place at the present time that have helped that -

MR. KERREY: Why didn't we modify the -- what do you call the on-flight
security procedures, the Common Strategy? Why didn't we modify that
common strategy to accommodate the possibility that suicide could be
something that the pilot -that a hijacker would select?

MR. SOLIDAY: Well, first of all, Senator Kerrey, the Common Strategy --
I'm glad you said modified because if you look at history the Common
Strategy has saved a lot of lives. To react in a violent way in the past
to many of the hijackers would have cost many, many lives. And so the
Common Strategy as with regard to how it interfaced with government
agencies did change over time. What we ask the folks on board to do
--again I would say to you that while the emphasis -- in fact at a noted
government hearing, after the Gore Commission, the Rand Corporation
produced a witness that said these people are not suicidal. He happened
to be an Israeli consultant.

So when we looked at the possibility of hijacking -- we at United
practiced hijacking four times after 1999, various forms of hijacking to
include an anthrax on the airplane. We practiced with the FBI, with
other government agencies, to ascertain how we could react, but the idea
that they would be able to train people to fly complex airliners and
navigate them was something that none of us contemplated.

MR. KERREY: Why?

MR. SOLIDAY: I would assume that the type of training we give to pilots
is very, very sophisticated. These were all glass cockpit airplanes -

MR. KERREY: No, but the why comes from you were training for the
possibility of hijacking -

MR. SOLIDAY: Yes.

MR. KERREY: And, by the way, the procedures in this particular case
would seem to be seriously flawed at the passenger screening level. We
heard earlier, this commission has heard that if I'm carrying a blade
that's smaller than four inches that I can -- and you know, I've been
screened and it's fine and they give it back to me, pre-9/11. I mean it
seems to be even there there's vulnerabilities that were rather
substantial to be able to take a plane over, but given all the -again,
even in this presentation that was done in 2000, but all the threat
assessments that were being done in '98,'99, 2000, 2001, they had to
include some discussion of suicide. As I mentioned -- the word I used
earlier was suicide has become a technology. Suicide attacks have become
a technology that increasingly is being used by, again, largely people
that are motivated by religion against us.

MR. SOLIDAY: I think first of all that is a fact that today we are very,
very aware after what's been happening in Israel that suicide is
something that they will do. But the thought that they would be able to
have the technical skill to fly an airplane, that level of education --
Senator Kerrey, in honesty with you, you are a trained spec ops person.
You know as well as I, sir, that these people could have gotten on that
airplane stark naked and done what they did.

MR. KERREY: Yes, they could have.

MR. SOLIDAY: So all of this discussion, you and I both know if we were
taking knives away, they would have planned the spec op around those
knives not being there.

MR. KERREY: This is why we'll send some written questions to you,
because I've got serious questions about the current strategy on the
airlines today. A lot of it, it seems to me, is reactive. A lot of, it
seems to me, to be politically motivated more than it is by motivated by
real security concerns, and I'd very much like -- I'll do it in writing
to you because I'd very much like to get feedback from you all because
I'd like very much for our -- part of our recommendations to be to say,
quit being motivated by politics here.

Let's figure out what the right solution is and do it, whether it's the
FAA's responsibility or your responsibility. These 19 guys who knocked
us over just as easy as could be, they exploited every visible weakness.
And you're exactly right, once they were on that plane their chances of
failure were practically zero. And I think we've got -- you've got to
help us, especially I think on the intel side, though it's -- I think
it's unarguable if you look at the presentation that was done in May of
2000 by the FAA. The FAA can't just say as they've done, they've given
us five or six pages of rebuttal to the Joint Committee saying we didn't
know, we didn't know, we didn't know, we didn't know, we didn't know.
It's like you know how many times can you say we didn't know before
somebody says, Jesus, you should have?

It was your responsibility. You should have asked if you didn't know.
You know, I didn't want to make the FBI mad, I didn't want to make the
CIA mad. I mean, given all the things that were going on, again the
background of '98, '99 and 2000, 2001, I mean I think you all can help
us a lot, not just to understand what happened that day, which I'm sure
makes you feel worse than it makes me in many ways. They were your
employees. You were associated with them in a very active and upfront
way. You've got to help us by being very frank. Not right now because
this commission's got to -- a lot of the Commissioners ask questions,
but you've got to in writing tell us what aren't we doing that we should
be doing, that we're -- whether -- I don't know if it's a national
identification card, if you think that's what it ought to be, tell us.

I don't have to worry about the National Rifle Association, I don't have
to worry about civil libertarians, I only have to worry about what you
tell me that should be done. And by the way, I'm a customer, and when
this commission finishes this work today, I'm taking the train back to
New York and no small measure because I find the security procedures not
only to be a nuisance, but I think they're largely ineffective.

I mean, you're exactly right, buck naked I sit on that plane and I say,
well, I hope they've got this thing figured out because -- well, first
of all, they'd never let me on, that would really be obnoxious, let me
on buck naked, but you -- yeah, you're not anxious to see that. I mean,
I hope that you'll help us by being as honest as you possibly can and as
frank and as detailed as you possibly can about what we aren't doing
that we ought to be doing to prevent this in the future.

MR. SOLIDAY: Senator Kerrey, I would look forward to that. I think I
agree with the things you have said and have participated at the
National Academy and other places. I think it's very, very important
that we focus on the future but we also recognize that these people were
highly skilled military professionals and the only way we stay ahead of
them is to have an iterative process continuously that grows
continuously and that we understand there is no one pill or no amount of
blame that will solve the problem. We need to have a system that
continuously improves itself.

MR. KERREY: The last thing I'll say is I hope that you --I'm asking you,
don't call this terrorism. It is terrorism but it's coming from a
relatively small group of Muslims who religiously believe in killing
infidels. That's the pathway to heaven and everybody in this room is an
infidel. And it's enormously important that we begin with that.
Otherwise, we, in the first instance, are unable to identify what the
risk is but, in the second instance, there is a tendency to have the
wrong policies and procedures that make it very difficult for us to be
very discriminating and to identify people who are genuinely a risk to
us.

I'm through.

MR. LEE HAMILTON: The chair is in a rather astounding position here of
not having any other commissioners who want to ask questions.

All right.

Mr. Lehman.

MR. LEHMAN: Thank you and I too applaud your willingness to come up here
and be beat up a little bit and also to really give us your
recommendations for the future. And again I would echo Senator Kerrey
that we would very much like your continuing participation and
recommendations. The record that has emerged from our staff's research
is one in which the weight of the industry has been continuously against
tightening up restrictions.

Now, you've articulated well the reasons why you didn't expect the
threat that came, but it's like so many of the arguments we've heard
earlier. It's not very persuasive that nobody told us, it's not our job
to decide what the threat is. And, of course, quite apart from what the
regulation that was cited stipulates, of course it's your job. I mean, I
would be willing to bet, if I could overhear some of your conversations
in a bar somewhere, that you're not full of praise and confidence for
the government's brilliance in handling all of your tax issues and your
inspection issues and what possible reason would you have to think that
you don't have to participate in intelligence assessment, threat
assessment?

The FAA was saying that it was perfectly all right for young Arabs to
come on to your airplanes with 4-inch knives and, you know, the
industry's attitude was, "Hey, it's not our business. The FAA says it's
okay, it's got to be okay." What's been missing from a lot of the
witnesses that we've had these last two days is an application at the
leadership level of the common sense test to some of these things. The
record that our staff has produced is one of the industry continuously
eroding and blocking and defunding initiatives like the first air
marshal initiative, the locked cockpit door initiative, the single key
initiative and one of the things that we've heard constant complaints
about from the immigration people is the industry's successful thwarting
of their efforts to fix the "transit without waiver" loophole, which the
industry has known has been used by terrorists, has been used heavily by
smugglers and could be relatively easily fixed with the building of
secure transit lounges and the kind of measures that most large
countries in the world, if not all of them, have.

Yet, as I understand it, even today, the industry is whinging and
whining because the President suspended this huge loophole. I would like
to hear how you, without, you don't necessarily have to respond to my
indictment of the pre-9/11 era, but how do you see your roles going
forward as an active challenger of the bureaucratic inertia that's
inevitably part of many of these government regulatory initiatives? Why
do we not have a single instance in our research of the industry saying,
"We've got to tighten up in screening. We're only paying minimum wage
and we have a 100 percent turnover of our people. We should be hiring
higher quality people. Why are you letting 4-inch blades aboard our
airplanes?"

We don't have any record of that and somehow, you guys have to change
the whole paradigm of the way you approach these safety issues. You've
got to be proactive and not a drag on the system which, historically,
you have been, unless you can provide us evidence that challenges the
overwhelming weight of evidence that we have so far.

MR. SOLIDAY: Commissioner Lehman, if I could begin the response and then
maybe others would like to join me. I understand your frustration and I
understand your comments. As you know, by my biography, I hold several
major trophies for development of enhanced ground proximity warnings,
FOQA systems, so forth, all of which happen to be on the aviation side.
We are not mandated by the government.

Quite frankly, if you look at the record, we tested numerous things long
before they were mandated. Immediately after TWA 800, we, as a company,
talked with the FAA and said we are prepared to move forward with some
security measures to ramp up because we don't know what caused this. The
problem is -- and you can make light of it, if you like -- a citizen
does not have the right to search and seize. There are privacy issues
and, for example, as a company who was prepared to roll CAPPS out and
did roll it out long before any other company, a visitor from the
Justice Department who told me that if I had more than three people of
the same ethnic origin in line for additional screening, our system
would be shut down as discriminatory.

MR. LEHMAN: That is an important point.

MR. SOLIDAY: Tell me about common sense.

MR. LEHMAN: I agree with you totally. What I'm suggesting is that your
childlike faith, in your earlier testimony, in the ability of the
government to provide you threat warnings, you should be equally
skeptical about. These are all good points. think you're right.

MR. SOLIDAY: Again, I hope I did not come across as making excuses. We
have a clear role. There are more people in the intelligence community
in the United States than we have in our airline, or had in our airline.

MR. LEHMAN: That's the problem.

MR. SOLIDAY: Number two is that when we have an inkling, there is a
limit to what we can do without the authority of government. No matter
how cooperative we try to be, there are limits and quite frankly, a
number -- we have the first CTX machine ever made on our property long
before it was certified. We went out and looked at Quadrupole, quite
frankly used it, not in a certified way, because of the human factors
issues that are in X-ray screening.

A number of us were advocating we needed research and development in
systems that were red-light, green-light as opposed to interpretive. We
went out and worked with the FAA to put those into practice. We couldn't
use them as official systems because they were not approved systems. But
we used them in San Diego to demonstrate their effectiveness, but could
not get funding for further research in those types of technologies.

So, again, all of us know that I don't think there's anybody at the
table -- I know them all quite well -- that doesn't do a lot of
self-examination, but I think it is a bit unfair that we did not go the
extra mile.

MR. ARPEY: Commissioner Lehman, let me just add a follow-on to his
point. You know, Ed, you're talking really CAPPS I in the pre-9/11
environment and I think coming back to what Senator Kerrey was saying
earlier, some of this does defy common sense. In a post-9/11
environment, we had situations where our crew members were uncomfortable
with passengers on board the airplane, they hauled them off the airplane
and I think -- there was 10 or 11 of them -- and today we're being sued
by the DOT over each one of those cases.

MR. LEHMAN: That's something we should definitely follow up on because
if DOT is still pursuing that policy that we will get involved.

MR. STUDDERT: I think last month United was actually fined. We should
follow up for you on that.

MR. LEHMAN: Is that right? Could you get us data? We'd be happy to take
up your cause.

MR. ARPEY: You know, despite that kind of situation that does I think
lack some common sense, we continue -- and I suspect United is the same
way -- to advocate to our crew members, if anyone is on the airplane
that makes you uncomfortable or in any way you think compromises safety,
get them off the airplane. The captain is the in-flight security
coordinator for every flight and is the final authority on everything.
So despite some of the stuff that we deal with, we do make a lot of
commonsense decisions and give our crew members a lot of commonsense
advice and we tell them, you don't worry about lawsuits and that kind of
stuff. We'll take care of that.

MR. STUDDERT: Yeah, we back them up on their decisions.

MR. LEHMAN: By the way, to follow up on that, we put a great deal of
faith and have got a great deal of benefit in the Navy, for instance,
out of Red Teams. And we just heard testimony this morning that there is
a continuing emphasis -although this might be a little controversial --
on using the Red Teams in FAA again. Do you get direct access to these
Red Team reports? When they come through, when they send a team of Spec
Ops type people through your security system and find big holes in it,
do you hear about that directly or not?

MR. AHERN: There's a lot of data about the Red Teams. Initially we did
not. Under General Canavan's leadership we did, in the summer of 2001
there was a review of the Red Team audits. I won't -- again, I can't
speak of industry but I certainly can tell you that the audits that were
conducted at American actually showed that we were quite effective, with
one error in a particular city. There were three audits that I'm
familiar with that we did receive in the summer of 2001 from the Red
Team. But General Canavan invited all the security directors. My
subordinate went to the session and they reviewed some of the Red Team
audits and provided us data on airline-specific data.

MR. LEHMAN: But not since?

MR. AHERN: I don't know. Again, I changed jobs in 2002. I haven't seen
any since 2002. I certainly can get the data from our security folks.

MR. LEHMAN: Would you agree you ought to get them on a regular basis?

MR. AHERN: Absolutely. Absolutely.

MR. LEHMAN: That's good. We'd appreciate it if you'd give us the follow
up data on that.

MR. SOLIDAY: Mr. Lehman, just a thought on the Red Teams. There is a
difference between the Red Teams and the regulators who audit. The Red
Teams are supposed to find vulnerabilities in the system. And while I'm
not disagreeing with Mr. Ahern, there are things that they find that
really do need to be kept -- we need to know the solution. But
transmitting vulnerabilities to large volumes of people does not always
serve the best interest.

MR. LEHMAN: How about just like the people at your table here?

MR. SOLIDAY: If we do that, there are 195 carriers in the United States.
That would be two per carrier, that's 400 people. One of the great
problems we've had with security is that almost any procedure we
implement is leaked and it's vetted in the media. And quite frankly, in
some of the discussion we have had there are things that we shouldn't
know because they compromise the ability to gather the information. So I
think -

MR. LEHMAN: But I think that's a tiny -

MR. SOLIDAY: -- that balance -

MR. LEHMAN: I understand your point, but I think it's largely
inapplicable because many of the things that the hijackers found in
their -- as they did their intel work and casing, their own Red Teaming,
before they decided which airports to hit, so forth, had already been
identified in Red Team reports and had not been passed on to you.
Wouldn't you have rather known about those vulnerabilities directly,
even if other people learned about them too, because the terrorists are
going to find out about them anyway likely?

MR. SOLIDAY: I would want to know about the vulnerabilities and I would
want the ability and the power to deal with them. But, again, there are
some limits.

MR. LEHMAN: Could I get each of your airlines' views on how we solve
this "transit without visa" issue?

MR. STUDDERT: Both Ed and I have left United in the last year, over a
year ago, so it's hard for me to speak for the current situation. Ed
might want to give you a general overview of what was going on in the
past.

MR. LEHMAN: Well, now we'll get a better answer from both of you.

MR. SOLIDAY: I think there are -- I think the TSA acted appropriately. I
don't work for United anymore so I would say that there are
vulnerabilities. We have identified them. We did offer -- as I
understand, United offered some alternatives. Building terminals takes
time. When there is a threat you want to deal with it in some way in the
short term and then some of the solutions I see are -- sound like
wonderful ideas but they don't work for seven years. So -

MR. LEHMAN: Yes, but I would point out that the ATA's argument 28 years
ago when this temporary "transit without visa" was put in -- Mr. Ahern?

MR. AHERN: Yeah, I'll just add a comment that in many of our locations
we already have a situation where we can control the individual. That
doesn't mean that we have in all our international gateways, and that's
certainly an issue that we would have to address. But I think from an
operational standpoint, the key to this process is making sure that as
the individual comes into the country they stay in a separate area and
they leave the country in a separate area as well, and we already have
that in place in many of our larger cities. So I think that that's the
number one thing that needs to get done and then again we'll work with
the intelligence community to decide what else needs to get done.

MR. ARPEY: I think the key is you just -- you need to remain in control
of the passengers throughout the journey.

MR. LEHMAN: Yeah, I -- and I mean in other countries they don't
officially enter the country because there's a secure
Customs/Immigration area, transit lounge, that they stay in. What has
not worked is the airlines saying, trust us, we'll have somebody hold
the person's hand for 24 hours while they go in and have dinner in
Harlem. It doesn't work.

Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Congressman Roemer.

MR. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I'm interested -- Mr. Soliday, you're straight shooting with us. You
don't work at United anymore and hopefully you can give us very candid
and honest answers, as you've been doing here. You have said to our
staff that you used to work pretty closely with Irish Flynn, who was
before our commission a little bit earlier, and I think you've also said
that you frequently talked with the FAA security, sometimes three or
four times a day. I'm interested in what you conveyed back and forth.
Did Mr. Flynn tell you about the specific instances? For instance, we
have a host of different occasions when there were FAA individuals
involved in intelligence briefings, that gathered information on
specific threats to U.S. carriers, such as the Bojinka plot. We have FAA
intelligence individuals that attended a number of meetings throughout
'98 and '99 and 2000 where they also picked up this information, and in
2001. What kinds of information did Mr. Flynn pass on to you in these
three or four conversations that you had per day?

MR. SOLIDAY: I certainly did not talk to the associate administrator
three or four times a day. Our staff talked to the FAA principal
security inspector three or four times a day. There were issues of
interpretation, there were issues of things just in applying the system.
You have seen the manuals, you have

MR. ROEMER: Was any of it informational intelligence oriented, either
general terrorist threat or specific terrorist threat information? Or
was this all on -

MR. SOLIDAY: No.

MR. ROEMER: -- implementing general -

MR. SOLIDAY: This was implementing -- if I were to talk to Associate
Administrator Flynn, it would be about -- generally it would be about
advanced technologies. He would ask me what our experience was with CTX
implementation because he wanted to hear it firsthand.

MR. ROEMER: So there was no intelligence exchange ever between the two
of you?

MR. SOLIDAY: I can think that -- any time we say ever/never, that's -MR.
ROEMER: Rarely.

MR. SOLIDAY: I can think of one instance -

MR. ROEMER: Hardly ever.

MR. SOLIDAY: -- in particular that I came into Washington for a
briefing, very similar to the -

MR. ROEMER: Did this concern you at all that you were not getting any
kind of intelligence passed on, either in a general sense about a
threat, an evolving threat that you might be reading about in the paper
but not getting more specific information from the agency?

MR. SOLIDAY: I think things that I'm reading about in the paper, those
were being briefed regularly. The issue I would -

MR. ROEMER: By who, though? That's what I'm trying to figure out. Who
briefed -

MR. SOLIDAY: By the intel group from FAA, by -- like I say, on one
occasion Irish Flynn didn't do the briefing, but the associate
administrator was in the room to give emphasis to the importance. Again,
what -- if I'm hearing your question correctly, and correct me if I'm
wrong, it is one thing to get a briefing in which maybe 300 or 400
potential threats are listed, and another to have a prioritized briefing
that says, these are the things. There is X amount of resource that can
be devoted. So the discussion of threats out there is a part of every
day conversation: every day between myself and my staff; every day
between us and the FAA.

MR. ROEMER: Let me commend you. I think you also told our staff that
post-9/11 you hired an Israeli firm to perform an outside audit of
United's airport stations from the standpoint of risk. Can you give us
information as to what kinds of things were recommended to you in
ramping up security, and what obstacles you might have run into in order
to implement those?

MR. SOLIDAY: Yes, we used them after the OSAF threat in the Pacific.
Immediately when the threat became apparent to us, I had at that time an
Israeli consultant and consulting firm through the time I left. We asked
them to go out into the Pacific, look at our stations, look at them
specifically. Those things that we corrected -- I believe we have
records of what they were. I'm not certain we're not into some issues
that should be in private as opposed to -- but that is true. Then in the
9/11 instance -- post-9/11, as I shared with the staff, I brought him in
in the first flight that I could get him here, asked him to share with
me additional things that we could do.

MR. ROEMER: Without being specific about what those are -I agree with
you, maybe we can share that in writing or in a closed session -- would
you have difficulties with the airline today implementing those or with
the FAA?

MR. SOLIDAY: I would have difficulty with the government in general. His
-- I can give you his high-level assessment. His exact words were, "You
Americans are obsessed with the means. The only way you will stop them
is by keeping them off the airplanes, and to do that you must do
aggressive profiling." One carrier shared their data and you know the
results of that.

MR. ROEMER: In your view, you also said to our staff, that today we have
more consistent training of screeners but no significant improvement in
technology and no apparent improvement in performance. Do you stick by
that? Do you modify that?

MR. SOLIDAY: The issue was -- when one talks about performance, the
context of that conversation, as I recall it, was in regard to one
particular element. One of the issues that has been alive since 1981, a
number of studies, is the human factors of screeners' interaction with
the technology. The popular view was that it was solely economic. That
was reinforced by a number of government auditing agencies that if you
just change the pay, then screening will get better. But, quite frankly,
if you look at the National Academy of Science panel study in 1996, it
said specifically there was very little evidence that pay would change
anything. There were significant human factors issues.

The FAA applied a number of times for grants to do the kind of human
factor studies that we did with pilots, being part of the crew resource
management. I know I don't look like I'm old enough to have been part of
the beginning, but I was. We spent millions in the government to
understand why pilots error. We have just scratched the surface of
understanding why screeners fail to detect.

I believe Mr. Lehman or one of the previous people who testified talked
about probability of detection. So when I shared with them that not -- I
think that it would be wrong to say that the overall security has not
improved. It certainly has. But in certain areas if you look at the rate
of detection, it is not significantly better than before. Now, we've
added layers on both sides to take -- just like we do in an airplane. If
we know a system has a 10 to the minus 9th probability of failure, then
we say that is safe to fly. But if we have a 10 to the minus 7th, I'm
required --or the manufacturer is -- to build redundancy to get to 10 to
the minus 9th.

One of the things that Senator Kerrey talked about was we've done a
number of things that are emotional, instead of looking at a risk level
that we are comfortable with. And if you look at security in a true risk
assessment way, you start looking at the human factors. Why do people
fail? It's not because they don't care. It's because there are failure
modes in the technology and how the humans interface with that
technology that we don't understand.

MR. ROEMER: I appreciate your very helpful answers. I know we're running
out of time and I think Senator Kerrey has one final question.

MR. KEAN: Yes, Senator Kerrey for the final question.

MR. KERREY: Well, I'm going to try to be as brief as I can. I would very
much like to provide you gentlemen with a number of documents. The one
is the response of the FAA to a series of statements that are actually
made by the Joint Committee. This is the FAA coming back and defending
themselves against statements that were made by the Joint Committee that
did their earlier evaluation.

And the reason I'd like to have you look at it is these are very precise
intelligence assessments that are being made by various people in
national security organizations, most generally coming out of the CIA.
And it causes me -- as I read this and as I look at the PowerPoint
presentation that was done in 2000, I look at this and say, had this
information gotten to the people that were in charge of security, I
think they would have immediately said suicide is a real possibility. So
I mean I don't -- I honestly do not buy this idea that it's
unimaginable. That what happened on 11 September was unimaginable. We
should have been able to imagine it. We should have been able to imagine
it and defend it.

And I very much agree with you, Mr. Soliday, there's two big ways I
think you get the job done. One is by preventing them from getting on
the plane in the first place, and I think there's a couple of --
personally, I think there's a couple of relatively simple things that
could have been done and still could be done that could eliminate all
these long lines and all this harassment and all this difficulty getting
on the airplane and making it difficult to fly and causing people to
wonder what in the heck is going on.

There's a couple of relatively simple things that could be done prior to
people getting on the airplane and I think, for political reasons, we
don't want to do it. And I think the American people want you to tell us
what are those simple things. And if the politicians are afraid -- the
elected politicians are afraid, we need to give them some room and give
them permission to do it because I mean I see a lot of the stuff being
done. I mean, we heard Mr. Bonner yesterday in here talking about what
he's doing to make his agency work. I've got to tell you it'll be four
or five years before the INS and Customs start working together as a
family. And in the meantime if you're relying on them to make certain
that they screen these people out, you're relying on the wrong agency.
You've got to figure it out on your own. You've got to figure out how to
keep people off planes that are willing to die in the act of killing
passengers and killing other people on the ground, because I think -- I
personally feel that unless you provide us with that information, it's
not likely to come from anybody else.

MR. KEAN: I want to thank you all very, very much. We appreciate your
testimony and appreciate your help.

Okay, we're ready to recommence. We now come to our second staff
statement and, together with Mr. Zelikow, I would like to recognize Sam
Brinkley of our commission staff.

MR. PHILIP ZELIKOW: Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, this
statement continues our presentation of initial findings on how the
individuals who carried out the 9/11 attacks defeated the civil aviation
security system of the United States. We continue our investigation into
the status of civil aviation security today and for the future. These
findings and judgments may help your conduct of today's public hearing
and will inform the development of your recommendations.

The findings and judgments we report today are the results of our work
working with you so far. We remain ready to revise our understanding of
these topics as our work continues. Our staff was able to build upon
investigative work that has been conducted by various agencies,
including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Department of
Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration is fully
cooperating with our investigators, as are the relevant airlines and the
Federal Aviation Administration.

We spoke earlier today about how the hijackers defeated all of the
pre-boarding defense layers; the U.S. civil aviation security mounted on
September 11, 2001. We will return now to the last line of defense: the
Common Strategy in response to hijackings as implemented onboard the
aircraft by the flight crew on the four flights.

Bill Johnstone will begin.

MR. WILLIAM JOHNSTONE: Thank you.

As you've heard earlier today, the anti-hijacking training for civil
aviation aircraft crews in place on 9/11 was based on previous
experiences with domestic and international hijackings and other hostage
situations. It was aimed at getting passengers, crew and hijackers
safely landed, and it offered little guidance for confronting a suicide
hijacking. Air carrier responsibilities for security and anti-hijacking
training for flight crews were set forth in the Air Carrier Standard
Security Program. In addition to specifying the number of hours of
required security training, it provided an outline of in-flight
hijacking tactics for both the cockpit and crews. Among other things,
the outline advised air crews to refrain from trying to overpower or
negotiate with hijackers, to land the aircraft as soon as possible, to
communicate with authorities, and to try delaying tactics.

One of the FAA officials that we've spoken to, who was most involved
with the Common Strategy in the period leading up to 9/11, described it
as an approach dating back to the early 1980s which was developed in
consultation with the industry and the FBI and based on the historical
record of hijackings. The point of the strategy was to optimize actions
taken by flight crew to resolve hijackings peacefully through systematic
delay and, if necessary, accommodation of the hijackers. The record had
shown that the longer a hijacking persisted, the more likely it was to
have a peaceful resolution. The strategy operated on the fundamental
assumptions that hijackers issue negotiable demands most often for
asylum or the release of prisoners, and that suicide -- as we got a
quote, "Suicide wasn't in the game plan of hijackers."

Thus, on September 11, 2001, Common Strategy, which was the last line of
defense against these hijackers, offered no defense against the tactics
employed by the hijackers of Flights 11, 77, 93 and 175.

Mr. Zelikow. I'm sorry, my mistake. The day of Tuesday, September 11,
2001, began for the U.S. civil aviation system as one marked by
exceptionally fine weather across the country and the absence of any
significant overnight problems in the system which required the
attention of the workday shifts at the FAA and at the airlines as they
took over across the country. We wish at this point again to advise the
family members of victims who may be viewing this statement or listening
to it that the details we will be recounting may be especially painful
for you to hear. Please consider whether you wish to continue viewing,
at least at this time.

Before we proceed with the details, we first wish to pay tribute to all
of the brave men and women who were the source for most of what we know
about what transpired on-board American Airlines Flight 11, United
Airlines Flight 175, American Airlines Flight 77 and United Airlines
Flight 93. In just a few short minutes we will be hearing about one of
those heroes, flight attendant Betty Ong who perished on Flight 11, from
another individual, American Airlines reservations manager, Nydia
Gonzales. Ms. Gonzales spoke with Ms. Ong on that tragic morning and
made sure that her voice was heard then and continues to be heard to
this day.

There are many others who we wish to recognize, both passengers and
crew, who were able to reach out to let their companies, their friends
or their families know what had befallen then, and in so doing they
enabled us to tell their story here today. Among them -- and this is not
meant to be an exhaustive list -- also from Flight 11, Betty Ong's
fellow flight attendant Madeline "Amy" Sweeney; from Flight 175, flight
attendant Robert Fangman, passengers Peter Burton Hanson and Brian David
Sweeney; from Flight 77, flight attendant Renee May and passenger
Barbara Olson; from Flight 93, flight attendants CeeCee Lyles and Sandy
Bradshaw, passengers Todd Beamer and Jeremy Glick.

There is every indication that all members of the flight crews did their
duty on that day with dedication and professionalism.

Thank you.

MR. ZELIKOW: To continue the discussion of hijacker tactics and beyond,
I want to turn the floor over to Sam Brinkley, but first mention that
Sam's background for the Commission includes the fact that not only was
he a battalion commander in the U.S. Marine Corps, but Sam has also
served as a federal air marshal.

MR. BRINKLEY: Thank you very much, Philip.

The question is what do we know about the tactics used in the takeover
of the four flights. The hijackers strategically planned the flights
they chose: Early morning departures from East Coast airports of large
Boeing 757 and 767 aircraft fueled for a transcontinental flight to
maximize the destructive power of the impact on their selected targets.

One fact that I want to point out. There is no evidence at this time to
suggest that the 9/11 hijackers or their associates purchased unused
tickets for the hijacked flights. And with the Chairman's permission I
would like to move to the charts.

The seat selection on the two type aircraft are indicative of the
planning of the hijackers in being able to conduct their operation.
First of the two charts on the 757. In both instances you will notice
that the pilot -- Jarrah on Flight 93 and Hanjour on Flight 77 -- were
sitting in the very front row of these aircraft. This single-aisled
airplane gives less maneuverability and access to the cockpit than a
double-aisled airplane. This was carefully chosen. These are not random
seat selections. You will also notice that the remaining members of the
hijack team were placed in a position to better have them be able to
seal off the front cabin of the aircraft from the passenger cabin crew.

In contrast, the 767 aircraft of Flight 11 and Flight 175 show a
significantly different arrangement of the hijack teams. In both these
cases two members of the hijack team were sitting well forward and
guarding the front end of the aircraft. In fact, in both of these the
pilot, designated pilot, was sitting in the center between members of
the hijack team, two in front and two behind, which allows the hijack
team to better off seal and move forward and to the rear, and to then
also control both aisles as the maneuverability capability to seal off
the front of the aircraft. These indicators show that the test flights
they took and the process they did in their planning demonstrated in
their seat selections which could not have been at random.

The question has been raised about whether one or more of the hijackers
may have used pilot's credentials in order to sit in the cockpit with
the pilots during the flight to facilitate the takeover. In view of the
requisite paperwork and other procedures which must be followed to
permit a jumpseat privilege, there is no evidence that such a tactic was
used by the hijackers. They actually had reservations and sat in the
seats that they were assigned.

We do know that the seating arrangement chosen by the hijackers
facilitated the isolation of the front of the aircraft and the terrorist
pilots' entry into the cockpit. The exact method of entry into the
cockpit is not known. However, the strength of the cockpit doors in use
on 9/11 would not have precluded forced entry. Cockpit keys were widely
available on that day. Also the Common Strategy did authorize flight
crews to allow entry into the cockpit under certain circumstances. There
is no way to know whether the terrorist had an access to a key, but if
not, access to the cockpit could readily be gained by luring the flight
deck crew out of the cockpit or forcing the door open.

From what we have learned so far, the hijackers successfully gained
control of the forward section of the cabin after the aircraft seatbelt
sign was turned off. The flight attendants began cabin service and the
passengers were allowed to begin to move around the cabin. This was
followed by the hijackers gaining access to the cockpit. There is
scattered and conflicting evidence about what happened to the cockpit
crew during the takeover, but what we do know is that at some point the
pilots were displaced and no longer in command of the aircraft.

The evidence we have examined to date indicates that the terrorists'
tactics and techniques initially resembled the traditional hijacking
scenarios. The hijackers took over the aircraft by force or threat of
force. This was reported on all four flights. The hijackers gained
access to the cockpit and sealed off the front of the aircraft from the
passengers and the remaining cabin crew. This was reported with slight
variation on all four flights.

Some of these reports included the presence of mace and/or pepper spray
in the cabin and indications that passengers had difficulty breathing.
We believe this indicates that the terrorists created a sterile area
around the cockpit by isolating the passengers and attempting to keep
them away from the forward cabin, in part by using mace or pepper spray.
Pepper spray was found in Atta's checked luggage that was recovered at
Logan Airport.

The hijackers used the threat of bombs. This was reported for all but
Flight 77. They also used announcements, reported for Flights 11, 77 and
93, to control the passengers as the aircraft supposedly flew to an
airport destination. These longstanding tactics for terrorist hijackings
were consistent with the paradigm of the Common Strategy developed for
flight crew response to hijackings. There were no reasons for flight
crew to respond outside the training they had received at the time their
respective flight was hijacked.

Even so, as the hijackings progressed, there is evidence of growing
awareness aboard the aircraft that something extraordinary was
unfolding. Callers from both Flights 11 and 175 noted early in the
process very erratic flying patterns and talked about the possibility
that the hijackers were piloting the aircraft. Reports from Flight 175
included one passenger predicting the hijackers intended to fly the
aircraft into the building. Another said the passengers were considering
storming the cockpit.

Later on Flight 77 at least one passenger was explicitly informed about
what had happened to Flights 11 and 175, And, as widely know in the case
of Flight 93, a growing awareness among the passengers of what had
already occurred with the other flights spurred a heroic attempt to take
over the plane from the hijackers. The nation owes an eternal debt of
gratitude to those who took action to ensure that Flight 93 never
reached its target.

Let's turn to pilot training. To successfully complete the 9/11 plot
aboard the aircraft, at least one member of the team had to be able to
pilot the plane, navigate it to the desired location, and direct it to
the intended target. These tasks required extensive training and
preparation. FAA records show that four of the 19 hijackers, one aboard
each flight, possessed FAA certificates as qualified pilots. FAA
certification required that a candidate complete a requisite amount of
flight training and pass both a written exam and a practical skills
test. Each of the four pilots received flight training in the United
States, which is recognized as having one of the world's most advanced
pilot training, education and certification in the world, and trains
many pilots from many nations.

Among the five hijackers on American Flight 11, only Mohamed Atta held a
certificate from the FAA as a qualified private and commercial pilot,
including proficiency rating in multi-engine aircraft operation. Atta
received his commercial pilot certificate in December of 2000. Records
indicate that Atta received Boeing flight simulator training sessions.
According to the experts questioned by commission staff, simulator
training was critical for the hijacker to familiarize himself with the
cockpit controls and the proper operation of the Boeing 757 and 767, the
type hijacked on 9/11, and to gain the operational proficiency of feel
and confidence necessary to fly the aircraft into an intended target.

Among the five hijackers aboard United Airlines Flight 175, only Marwan
al-Shehhi is known to have completed flight training and possessed an
FAA pilot certificate. Al-Shehhi received his commercial pilot
certificate in December 2000 on the same day and at the same facility as
Atta received his. He also had Boeing flight simulator training.

Among the five hijackers aboard American Airlines Flight 77, Hani
Hanjour was the sole individual who FAA records show completed flight
training and received FAA pilot certification. Hanjour received his
commercial multi-engine pilot certificate from the FAA in March 1999. He
received extensive flight training in the United States including flight
simulator training and was perhaps the most experienced and highly
trained pilot among the 9/11 hijackers.

Among the four hijackers aboard United Airlines Flight 93, Ziad Jarrah
was the lone individual who is recorded as having received flight
training and FAA pilot certification. Jarrah received his private pilot
certificate from the FAA in November 2000 and was recorded as having
received Boeing flight simulator training. Staff would note that Jarrah
had logged only 100 flight hours and did not possess a commercial pilot
certificate or multi-engine rating.

The staff would note the existence of computer-based software programs
that provides cockpit simulation available on the open market to the
general public. According to the experts at FAA, such computer
based-training packages, including products that simulate cockpit
controls of the Boeing 757 and 767, provided effective training
opportunities. The terrorists were known to use computers and there is
no reason to believe they did not have the computer literacy necessary
to take advantage of computer-based training aids.

Although the investigation is still ongoing into what methods the
hijackers employed to navigate and direct the aircraft toward their
target, the following information is offered in regard to this analysis.
Boeing 757, 767 aircraft are outfitted with highly capable flight
management systems and autopilot features. Knowledge of these systems
could be gained through simulator training, readily available
operational manuals, and perhaps PC-based simulator software.

Information from the flight recorder recovered from Flight 77 indicated
that the pilot had input autopilot instructions for a route to Reagan
National Airport. It should be noted the flight management computer
could be programmed in such a manner that it would navigate the aircraft
automatically to a location of the hijacker's choosing, not merely a
commercial airport, at a speed and altitude they desired, provided the
hijackers possessed the precise positioning data necessary.

By using the sequence waypoints dialed into the computer, the hijackers
could also approach the target from the direction they wanted. Financial
records indicate that one of the hijackers had purchased a global
positioning system, perhaps for the purpose of acquiring precise
positioning data on al Qaeda's 9/11 targets. They had also purchased a
Boeing flight deck video and flight simulator software program. Flight
manuals were also found among their belongings.

The Commission continues to acquire and analyze data on pilot training,
operational requirements, flight information and other relevant evidence
that will provide the most informed theory of what means the hijackers
used to fly the aircraft to their targets. Whether the hijackers flew
the aircraft manually, engaged the flight management computer to take
them to a programmed destination, or employed some combination of the
two, experts consulted by the Commission believe it quite credible that
given the certificates held by the hijackers, the training and
educational opportunities available to them through the publicly
available flight operations manual and computer-based flight training
software, the hijackers, particularly Atta, Hanjour and al Shehri, had
the know-how to complete the mission.

Let's turn to weapons. Records of purchases by the hijackers and other
evidence indicate that the knives with blades of less than 4 inches long
were the primary weapons of choice We demonstrated one sample of that
this morning. With regard to reports from crew, passengers, knives were
sighted on all four flights. The threat of a bomb was reported in
Flights 11, 175 and 93. Box cutters were specifically indicated in only
one report, from Flight 77. Staff specifically notes reports from
callers aboard at least two of the hijacked aircraft, 11 and 177,
suggesting that the terrorists used mace or pepper spray aboard the
flight.

As mentioned previously, the evidence suggests that one of the tactics
employed by the hijackers on all the flights was to move the passengers
to the back of the aircraft, away from the cockpit. Mace, pepper spray
or a similar substance would have aided the terrorists in that effort
and assisted them in maintaining a controlled area around the flight
deck. Both mace and pepper spray were specifically prohibited items
under the Air Carrier Standard Security Program. The questions of how
these items were carried on board remains an issue under investigation.

One is left to consider the following. Had the consequences of being a
selectee under the passenger pre-screening program, as nine of the
terrorists were, required a more intense screening of the selectee, as
had been the case before the pre-screening system was computerized in
1998, the system would have stood a better chance of detecting the
prohibited item, possibly depriving the terrorist of an important
weapon. Staff notes this is in order to highlight a major policy
question arising from the Commission's investigation. Was it wise to
ease the consequences of being a pre-screening selectee at a time when
the U.S. government perceived a rising terrorist threat, including
domestically and when the limits of detection technology and
shortcomings of checkpoint screening efficiency were well-known?

Moreover, we believe that in practice, the FAA's approach to admonishing
air carriers to use common sense about what items should not be allowed
on an aircraft, while also approving the air carrier's checkpoint
guidelines that define the industry's common sense, created an
environment where both parties could deny responsibility for making hard
and most likely unpopular decisions.

The question remains about a gun. We continue to investigate the
allegations that a gun was used aboard American Airlines Flight 11. This
allegation arose from a notation in an executive summary produced on
September the 11th, 2001 by FAA staff, indicating that the FAA
headquarters had received a report of a shooting aboard the plane,
reportedly from an American Airlines employee at the company's operation
center. The individual alleged to have made that report to the FAA
denies having done so. While staff continues to investigate the origins
and accuracy of the report, we note, regardless of what reports were
received in the chaotic environment of various operation centers at the
FAA, the airports and the airlines -- the only authoritative information
about whether a shooting occurred on Flight 11 had to have come from
individuals on the aircraft who were reporting what was taking place to
contacts on the ground.

Two flight attendants aboard American Airlines Flight 11 placed calls to
ground contacts to report what was happening to the aircraft, and as
indicated above, the Commission will receive testimony shortly about
Mrs. Ong's call. Staff notes that the flight attendants did their duty
with remarkable courage. The evidence shows that the flight attendants
remained in phone contact with authorities for an extended period of
time, providing valuable information with extraordinary professionalism.
Their actions were nothing short of heroic.

Neither the tape recordings of the call from flight attendant Betty Ong,
nor the accounts by at least seven separate witnesses to the calls
placed by Ms. Ong or Ms. Madeline Sweeney reported the presence of a gun
or the occurrence of a shooting. The witnesses' accounts of the phone
calls were consistent and are quite specific about the kind of weapons
that were reported present, knives, mace and a bomb, as well as the
nature of the assaults on board, the stabbing of flight crew members and
a passenger.

In order to accept the accuracy of the initial FAA executive summary
with regard to a shooting, disregarding the evidence by eyewitnesses to
the contrary, one would have to believe that the American Airlines
systems operation center, the SOC, relayed to the FAA the account of a
shooting that no witness recalls, while neglecting to include the
account of a stabbing that was widely reported, including the personnel
in the SOC. This seems highly implausible.

Finally, staff notes that the alleged victim of the shooting was seated
in 9B. Both the seat and its occupant are described by several of the
witnesses' accounts from the aircraft as the place where the stabbing
occurred. At this point in the investigation it seems evident that the
form of attack on the business class passenger, the only attack upon a
passenger reported by the eyewitnesses, became garbled in the account of
the assault as it was relayed between the airline and the FAA
authorities in the fog and confusion of the rapidly unfolding events of
that day.

Other relevant evidence bears mentioning. While investigators have
uncovered evidence of numerous knife purchases by the 19 hijackers
leading up to September the 11th, 2001, no firearm purchases or
possession are in evidence. Further, the tactics of all four hijacking
teams involved in the plot were similar. No evidence has been uncovered
to suggest that the hijackers on any of the other flights used firearms,
and none were found in evidence at any of the crash sites, notably the
crash site of United Airlines Flight 93, where items from the aircraft
were collected as evidence.

To the contrary, the common tactic among the four teams of employing
knives and mace, the wielding of a bomb, either real or simulated, is
indicated by all other evidence. It seems unlikely that one of the teams
would depart from the tactical discipline of the plotters' mutual
strategy.

Finally, though it appears erroneous at this point in the investigation,
staff continues to develop information on how the gun story may have
come to be reported. Again, we stress our investigative work, including
on the issues we have discussed today, is by no means complete. Our
investigation continues.

MR. ZELIKOW: In conclusion, we started today by asking us all to try to
remember the world before 9/11 and the factors and pressures that
influenced the civil aviation security system prior to that day. We
cannot and will not forget the events of 9/11. The lessons of that
tragedy continue to inform our work, especially our effort to develop
recommendations to make America safer and more secure.

MR. KEAN: Thank you all very much. I want to say on behalf of the
Commission how much we appreciate the work of this staff, how
professional you are and how we recognize the fact that many of you are
working seven days a week at this point.

Thank you all very much.

September 11 will also be remembered for the countless acts of duty,
courage, selflessness and love. So many of those who lived them or
witnessed them are no longer with us. We are only left to imagine and to
contemplate. Many we do know about. Fire-fighters and police officers
who ran up the stairs of burning buildings to save others. Emergency
responders who rushed to the aid of the injured. Passengers and crew who
fought to assure that the terrorists never made it to their target.
Countless instances, people from all walks of life who reached out to
help. The multiple acts of courage that day are too numerous to recount,
but they live on as part of the story of September 11. They give
testimony to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of
unspeakable horror.

We are now going to hear one remarkable story of such courage. Aboard
American Airlines Flight 11 flight attendants Betty Ong and Amy Sweeney
were able to contact people on the ground and in the midst of dire
circumstances were able to relay critical information about what was
happening on the plane to the outside world. It so happens that a
portion of Ms. Ong's call to an American Airlines customer service
facility was recorded. We will listen shortly to that recording. Ms. Ong
was able to make contact with Ms. Nydia Gonzalez, an employee at the
American Airlines facility, via air phone after the terrorists had taken
over the aircraft. Ms. Gonzalez is with us today. Nydia herself is an
example of the great courage destroyed on that day -displayed on that
day of 9/11. With extraordinary composure, she talked with and comforted
Ms. Ong. She received and handled the vital information Ms. Ong provided
with remarkable professionalism and with compassion.

Also recorded was a call placed by Ms. Gonzalez to American Airlines
headquarters in Forth Worth, Texas. Without the capability of
transferring the call from Betty Ong to American Systems Operating
Center or to patch Operation Center personnel into the call from the
flight attendant, Ms. Gonzalez handled calls from both Ms. Ong and the
American Operations Center at once. She took the information she
received from Betty Ong on one line and immediately relayed it to
American Airlines operation personnel on the other. We will hear these
recordings of those calls after her testimony. Much of what we know
about the events of 9/11 are because of Ms. Ong and Ms. Sweeney and
other passengers and crew aboard the four aircraft who were able to
contact people by phone and relay vital information. There is every
indication that all members of the flight crews did their duty with
dedication and with professionalism.

I'd like at this point if I could to acknowledge Ms. Ong's sister and
brother who are with us today: Ms. Cathie Ong-Herrera and Mr. Harry Ong.
Would they please stand and on behalf of the Commission I'd like to
address our deepest sympathies to you upon your loss, and the
appreciation of a very grateful country for Betty Ong's heroism. Would
you like to stand and be recognized, please.

(Applause.)

Ms. Gonzalez.

MS. NYDIA GONZALEZ: On Tuesday, September 11 -

MR. KEAN: I'm sorry, go ahead.

MS. GONZALEZ: Do you need to swear me in?

MR. KEAN: Do you want to be sworn? I don't think we really need to with
you.

MS. GONZALEZ: Okay. On Tuesday, September 11, 2001, a day that forever
will be remembered as one of pain and anguish for our nation, I was the
operations specialist on duty at American Airlines Southeastern
Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina. As an operations
specialist, one of my responsibilities includes monitoring emergency
situations and forwarding information to American System Operations
Control. am here to share and describe an emergency call that will be
etched in my memory for the rest of my life.

At approximately 8:20 in the morning on Tuesday, September 11, Betty
Ong, an American Airlines flight attendant, called our reservations
office requesting assistance with a situation on American Airlines
Flight 11. Before I describe her call, let me tell you about this brave
and courageous individual. Betty Ong, affectionately known by her family
and friends as "Bee," was a flight attendant with American Airlines for
14 years. She was a very caring, warm and loving person. Her zest for
life, her passion for her job, her ability to make people laugh; and her
concern for mankind is what truly made her, along with her fellow crew
members, our first heroes of September 11th.

In a very calm, professional and poised demeanor, Betty Ong relayed to
us detailed information of the events unfolding on Flight 11. With the
assistance of her fellow crew members she was able to provide us with
vital information that would later prove crucial to the investigation.
Betty's selfless act of courage and determination may have saved the
lives of many others. She provided some important information which
ultimately led to the closing of our nation's air space for the first
time in its history. For approximately 23 minutes, Betty patiently told
us that she thought they were being hijacked because two or three men
had gained access to the cockpit and the cabin crew couldn't communicate
with the pilot. She informed us that two flight attendants had been
injured and a passenger might have been fatally stabbed. She indicated
that there wasn't a doctor onboard, but that they were able to
administer oxygen to one flight attendant and that she was able to
breathe.

Although she wasn't able to give us a description of the attackers, she
told us the seat locations of these individuals, which helped law
enforcement authorities identify the terrorist attackers. The teamwork
displayed by Betty and her fellow flight attendants, combined with their
extensive training in safety and security, enabled them to relocate the
passengers to an area of the cabin out of harm's way.

Several media accounts of what occurred on Flight 11 claimed that Betty
was hysterical with fear, shrieking and gasping for air. I am here to
tell this commission that those accounts are wrong. As I previously
stated, Betty was calm, professional and in control throughout the call.
I honestly believe after my conversation with Betty that the 81
passengers and nine crew members on Flight 11 had no idea of the fate
that they were to encounter that day.

Betty, we're here to commemorate you. Your acts of courage on September
11 will never be forgotten. On that day not only did you have a team of
fellow employees in the air, you also had a team pulling together on the
ground in reservations and security. Your loving family, your American
Airlines family, and your friends are extremely proud of your selfless
actions, and I for one will forever be grateful and honored to have had
the opportunity to know such a truly remarkable person. On that day you
asked, "Pray for us." As I assured you then I will assure you today, we
are. Absolutely.

MR. KEAN: We will now hear the recordings from the two phone calls. The
first phone call was placed from Betty Ong aboard the Flight 11 to Ms.
Gonzalez. We'll hear the entire four and a half minutes that was
recorded on that call. The second phone call was placed by Nydia
Gonzalez to the American Airlines operations center to report the call
from Mrs. Ong and to relay the Center information Mrs. Ong was
providing.

You may hear a momentary blank on the tape. The Commission edited a very
small portion in order to protect one family member from unnecessary
pain. The second phone call we will hear was approximately 20 minutes in
duration. Due to time constraints the Commission has selected four
minutes from that particular call.

(Phone calls played.)

BETTY ONG: Number 3 in the back. The cockpit's not answering. Somebody's
stabbed in business class and . . . I think there's mace . . . that we
can't breathe. I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.

MALE VOICE: Which flight are you on?

BETTY ONG: Flight 12.

OPERATOR: And what seat are you in? . . . Ma'am, are you there? . . .

BETTY ONG: Yes.

MALE VOICE: What seat are you in?

FEMALE VOICE: Ma'am, what seat are you in?

BETTY ONG: We're . . . just left Boston, we're up in the air.

FEMALE VOICE: I know, what . . .

BETTY ONG: We're supposed to go to LA and the cockpit's not answering
their phone.

FEMALE VOICE: Okay, but what seat are you sitting in? What's the number
of your seat?

BETTY ONG: Okay, I'm in my jump seat right now.

FEMALE VOICE: Okay.

BETTY ONG: At 3R. FEMALE VOICE: Okay. MALE VOICE: Okay, you're the
flight attendant? I'm sorry,

did you say you're the flight attendant?

BETTY ONG: Hello?

FEMALE VOICE: Yes, hello.

MALE VOICE: What is your name?

BETTY ONG: Hi, you're going to have to speak up, I can't

hear you.

MALE VOICE: Sure. What is your name?

BETTY ONG: Okay, my name is Betty Ong. I'm number 3 on

Flight 11.

MALE VOICE: Okay.

BETTY ONG: And the cockpit is not answering their phone. And there's
somebody stabbed in business class. And there's . . . we can't breathe
in business class. Somebody's got mace or something.

MALE VOICE: Can you describe the person that you said -someone is what
in business class?

BETTY ONG: I'm sitting in the back. Somebody's coming back from
business. If you can hold on for one second, they're coming back.

BETTY ONG: Okay. Our number 1 got stabbed. Our purser is stabbed. Nobody
knows who is stabbed who, and we can't even get up to business class
right now cause nobody can breathe. Our number 1 is stabbed right now.
And who else is . . .

MALE VOICE: Okay, and do we . . .

BETTY ONG: and our number 5 -- our first class passengers are -- galley
flight attendant and our purser has been stabbed. And we can't get into
the cockpit, the door won't open. Hello?

MALE VOICE: Yeah, I'm taking it down. All the information. We're also,
you know, of course, recording this. At this point . . .

FEMALE VOICE: This is Operations. What flight number are we talking
about?

MALE VOICE: Flight 12.

FEMALE VOICE: Flight 12? Okay. I'm getting . . . BETTY ONG: No. We're on
Flight 11 right now. This is Flight 11. MALE VOICE: It's Flight 11, I'm
sorry Nydia. BETTY ONG: Boston to Los Angeles. MALE VOICE: Yes.

BETTY ONG: Our number 1 has been stabbed and our 5 has been stabbed. Can
anybody get up to the cockpit? Can anybody get up to the cockpit? Okay.
We can't even get into the cockpit. We don't know who's up there.

MALE VOICE: Well, if they were shrewd they would keep the door closed
and -BETTY ONG: I'm sorry? MALE VOICE: Would they not maintain a sterile
cockpit?

BETTY ONG: I think the guys are up there. They might have gone there --
jammed the way up there, or something. Nobody can call the cockpit. We
can't even get inside. Is anybody still there?

MALE VOICE: Yes, we're still here. FEMALE VOICE: Okay. BETTY ONG: I'm
staying on the line as well. MALE VOICE: Okay. NYDIA GONZALEZ: Hi, who
is calling reservations? Is this

one of the flight attendants, or who? Who are you, hun? MALE VOICE: She
gave her name as Betty Ong.

BETTY ONG: Yeah, I'm number 3. I'm number 3 on this flight - And we're
the first . . .

NYDIA GONZALEZ: You're number 3 on this flight?

BETTY ONG: Yes and I have. . .

NYDIA GONZALEZ: And this is Flight 11? From where to where?

BETTY ONG: Flight 11.

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Have you guys called anyone else?

BETTY ONG: No. Somebody's calling medical and we can't get a doc --

(Beep)

MALE VOICE: American Airlines emergency line, please state your
emergency.

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Hey, this is Nydia at American Airlines calling. I am
monitoring a call in which Flight 11 -- the flight attendant is advising
our reps that the pilot, everyone's been stabbed.

MALE VOICE: Flight 11?

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Yep. They can't get into the cockpit is

what I'm hearing.

MALE VOICE: Okay. Who is this I'm talking to?

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Excuse me. This is Nydia, American

Airlines at the Raleigh Reservation Center. I'm the operations
specialist on duty.

MALE VOICE: And I'm sorry, what was your name again?

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Nydia . . .

MALE VOICE: Nydia. And what's your last name?

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Gonzalez -- G-o-n-z-a-l-e-z.

MALE VOICE: (Inaudible) -- Raleigh Reservations. Okay, now when you -

NYDIA GONZALEZ: I've got the flight attendant on the line with one of
our agents.

MALE VOICE: Okay. And she's calling how?

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Through reservations. I can go in on the line and ask
the flight attendant questions.

MALE VOICE: Okay . . . I'm assuming they've declared an emergency. Let
me get ATC on here. Stand by.

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Have you guys gotten any contact with anybody? Okay, I'm
still on with security, okay, Betty? You're doing a great job, just stay
calm. Okay? We are, absolutely.

MALE VOICE: Okay, we're contacting the flight crew now and we're . . .
we're also contacting ATC.

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Okay. It seems like the passengers in coach might not be
aware of what's going right now.

MALE VOICE: These two passengers were from first class?

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Okay, hold on. Hey Betty, do you know any information as
far as the gents . . . the men that are in the cockpit with the pilots,
were they from first class? They were sitting in 2A and B.

MALE VOICE: Okay.

NYDIA GONZALEZ: They are in the cockpit with the pilots.

MALE VOICE: Who's helping them, is there a doctor on board?

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Is there a doctor on board, Betty, that's assisting you
guys? You don't have any doctors on board. Okay. So you've gotten all
the first class passengers out of first class?

MALE VOICE: Have they taken anyone out of first class?

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Yeah, she's just saying that they have. They're in
coach. What's going on, honey? Okay, the aircraft is erratic again.
Flying very erratically. She did say that all the first class passengers
have been moved back to coach, so the first class cabin is empty. What's
going on on your end?

MALE VOICE: We contacted Air Traffic Control, they are going to handle
this as a confirmed hijacking. So they're moving all the traffic out of
this aircraft's way.

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Okay.

MALE VOICE: He turned his transponder off, so we don't have a definitive
altitude for him. We're just going by -- They seem to think that they
have him on a primary radar. They seem

to think that he is descending.

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Okay.

MALE VOICE: Okay, Nydia?

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Yes dear, I'm here.

MALE VOICE: Okay, I have a dispatcher currently taking the

current fuel on board.

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Uh, huh.

MALE VOICE: And we're going to run some profiles . . .

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Okay.

MALE VOICE: To see exactly what his endurance is.

NYDIA GONZALEZ: Okay.

MALE VOICE: Did she . . .

NYDIA GONZALEZ: She doesn't have any idea who the other passenger might
be in first. Apparently they might have spread something so it's --
they're having a hard time breathing or getting in that area.

What's going on, Betty? Betty, talk to me. Betty, are you

there? Betty? (Inaudible.) Okay, so we'll like . . . we'll stay open.
We, I think we might have lost her.

MALE VOICE: Okay.

END

MR. KEAN: Talk about it all you want, this brings it to life. Any of the
Commissioners have any questions they would like to ask? If not, Ms.
Gonzalez thank you, so very, very much for bringing yourself and this to
us today, thank you for your calmness, your heroism and thank members of
the Ong family for their courage in coming here today and for listening
to this. Thank you all very much, we have nothing but admiration for
your sister

Thank you.

MS. GONZALEZ: Thank you.

MR. KEAN: If I could ask Mr. Loy to take the stand please? Is Mr. Loy
here yet?

(Off mike.)

Our last witness of the day will be James M. Loy, deputy director of the
Department of Homeland Security.

Mr. Loy, thank you for coming today. Will you raise your right hand?

(Witness sworn.)

Thank you very much. You can begin your testimony, Mr. Loy.

MR. JAMES M. LOY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to just submit my
written testimony for the record if I may, sir, and just make a couple
of points orally and then ask or answer your questions. First of all, I
wanted to apologize for my absence in May. It was an opportunity
scheduling-wise that I had other engagements that just simply had to be
dealt with. I trust that my deputy at the time, Steve McHale was
providing good answers to the Commission but I realize how important
this work is. I've spent several hours on several occasions with the
private interviews and look forward to the testimony today, sir.

Just a couple of things that I think are very important for all of us to
keep in perspective as we proceed from the emotion of the panel you just
went through and move on to methodical day after day improvements in the
aviation security system of our country, and our homeland security
system in general. First of all, sir, I think it is enormously important
that we find a way to hold a sense of urgency, to sort of keep the edge.
Complacency is a fascinating thing, it finds its way to the surface in
people and in organizations and in even nations from time-to-time, and
this business that we're in, when we have an opportunity like you just
had to listen to those folks, we must find a way in our business to hold
that urgency.

I have a photo in my office that I took from a helicopter that was over
the Ground Zero site three days afterwards. And it's just there for the
principal reason of reminding me as I get up and leave the office, as I
go back into the office, day after day after day, that the work that we
are about is enormously important and noble work and that we have to
find a way to hold onto that edge. That is not to suggest that I see us
losing that edge from time to time, but there are certainly pressures
that would suggest this notion of a return to normalcy, whatever that
phrase means to people, but when it means returning to something in the
9/10/01 window, we're just not going there, and the idea for all of us
is to hold on to this sense of urgency as we move forward.

Secondly, sir, I think there's an awful lot of opportunities for us to
cite then and now, circumstances to reflect an enormous amount of work
that has been undertaken by the people in government, in the private
sector, at the state and local level, to grapple as successfully as we
can with the issues that are in front of us. Whether in this instance
it's about airports and airlines, whether it's about a difference in
terms of an instinct, in terms of whether or not we will use civil
penalties for the value they may induce in terms of behavior that we'd
like to see, whether it's about the construct of security directives and
emergency amendments that can, in a window of time, direct and encourage
the kind of behavior that makes a difference between whether or not
we're going to be grappling with the same kind of aftermath as we all
experienced in 9/11. I think there has to be an ethic of continuous
improvement in everything that we're doing. The very nature of what
we're about suggests that the enemy, the bad guys, are out there gaming
everything we're doing as we're doing it. And our challenge is to never
accept the notion that that project we just finished today or just put
online yesterday is that final puzzle piece that's going to make us
"secure", quote, unquote.

I believe this to be a journey -- it's not a destination. And at the
other end of the day our challenge is to demand as a part of the ethos
of the Department of Homeland Security and certainly the Transportation
Security Administration that continuous improvement is what they wake up
and drink and eat day after day after day, and never gaining contentment
with whatever level they've achieved, or we have achieved.

Another point that I think is important is this idea that it's an
all-hands evolution, to put it in military terms that I'm familiar with.
The idea that every citizen of this country, every trade association,
every sector of that economy that we often take for granted as the
underpinning of our quality of life, must find their way to contribute
to the well-being of this security paradigm, this environment which is
dramatically different after 9/11 than it was on 9/10/01.

I spoke this morning at a marine law conference, a gathering of elements
from the maritime industry and encouraged them and challenged them to
recognize that the contribution that each of them has to make is going
to be fundamentally different in this global war on terrorism. And I
don't use that term lightly, war, because in the days before 9/11 the
idea of anything that rose to the word war in our country meant that the
federal government basically picked up the tab for that. And the whole
notion of armies looking at each other across the falter gap or across
the demilitarized zone, it was the federal government that dealt with
whatever the issue was that in this war nature of our national
challenge. The global war on terrorism is something very different than
that and we must all rise to the occasion when it is our turn.

Another notion is that many of the agencies in our federal government
establishment and even down through state, locals and tribal have had
this notion of a prevention, response, consequence management paradigm
as a means by which they structured their thinking. And I think there
are, in the wake of 9/11, a requirement to break out the front end of
that thing we call prevention and concentrate on something that I have
at least termed awareness, or domain awareness, or situational
awareness, with the idea in mind that it deserves the intellectual
energy and investment that we make in so many of the things at the same
time.

To be truly focused on learning everything we can learn about what's
going on in the domain in which we work so as to be more productive when
we do get to things about prevention or response or consequence
management at the other end of the day. Our work must go forward as
threat-based risk-managed work. In learning what the terms are internal
to that notion are enormously important for all of us who are in the
business to get at. We must understand that risk is about, in its
simplest terms, the likelihood of something happening in times and
consequences if it occurs and in there are a couple of notions:
Criticality assessments, vulnerability assessments, likelihood
assessments and all of that as it plays out requires us to develop new
tools of the trade so as to truly have a means by which we can go
forward.

Technology is absolutely something that we must invest in. I am
absolutely of the mind that the means by which we can displace human
intensive elements of our system today deserve the investment of energy
and dollars necessary to make that happen.

So, in the Department of Homeland Security and in TSA, for example, sir,
we are working very hard with concentrating on those things that can
either improve systems we have in place or replace them with systems
coming on line that will be far fewer

\- far less intensive as it relates to people and far more intensive as
it relates to efficiency and effectiveness. I think we owe that not only
as a good steward of the taxpayers' dollar but in the interest of
getting the job done at the other end of the day.

Going forward, sir, I think there are probably a handful of things that
I would ask the Commission to look at very, very carefully. CAPPS 2, the
program is one of those opportunities that, when we put it on line,
we'll have a dramatic increase in both the customer service dimension
and the security dimension of what it's intended to do. It will replace
a system that is currently compromised, broken, if you will, and the
sooner we can sort through the eight descriptive elements that have been
identified by the appropriations this year to answer the questions
adequately for the Congress so that we can press on with this program.
Meeting every privacy concern that must be articulated along the way, we
will be able to make one of those infrequent step function improvements
in the security of passenger aviation.

We must be concentrating on the well-being of this workforce that we've
assembled. We have put together a workforce at the federal level and the
workplace that they deserve to go along with the efforts that they are
putting out for us must be dealt with as constructively as we can. As
you know, sir, in November of this year, every airport director in the
country will have the opportunity to reconsider whether or not they
would like to re-privatize the workforce that we have federalized along
the way. And we must have the answers in hand, the information and the
data face up on the table to help us make good judgments there.

Cargo is an issue that we must spend an awful lot more time on than we
have so far and I look forward to doing that. This Congress has
exhibited an interest in aviation cargo and we will press forward with
getting better at how we deal with it. And I think we should be not only
willing but obliged to revisit decisions taken as early as six months
ago, let alone a year ago, with again the idea in mind that judgments
that were taken then simply did not have all the cards face up on the
table often.

And if we can make better judgments today based on reconsideration, we
should be about the business of doing that.

And I'll close, sir, with where I opened. This sense of urgency, this
almost attitudinal approach to the work that we are undertaking, I know
it has been very evident in your deliberations and we, at the federal
government level, and at the state and local level, in the private
sector, must recognize the urgency of the business that we are working
about and make the commitments necessary to hold the edge with the
decisions that we are taking, with the investments that we are making so
that, at the other end of the day, we never find ourselves trying to
review one more time the horrible aftermath of a tragedy like 9/11.

Thank you very much, sir, and I'll be glad to answer your questions.

MR. KEAN: Thank you very much, sir.

Commissioner Fielding.

MR. FIELDING: Thank you very much, Admiral Loy, and thank you for coming
here today. I also should congratulate you for successfully being the
first administrator of the TSA. I was amused when I read some time ago
that you would -- you had said

\- I think it was to the Aviation Security Summit that you described
you'd gone from an organization with over 200 years of infrastructure to
an organization which was a piece of paper. Sometimes, that's not bad in
Washington, you understand.

MR. LOY: It is a wonderful opportunity as well as a challenge, yes, sir.

MR. FIELDING: But, in any event, as you know, we're seeking to determine
what took place in this horrible tragedy and what were the failures and
what were the flaws, what are the solutions and the fixes -

MR. LOY: Yes, sir.

MR. FIELDING: -- and what has been done and what needs to be done. We
understand that there is a risk and especially in situations and
discussions with you because, although we seek to find out in a public
session to reassure people and educate people, nonetheless we do
understand that there are certain things that should be better discussed
in closed sessions. So I am mindful of that. We'll understand that if
that's part of the responses you feel you should give. But we would seek
your cooperation in all regards.

MR. LOY: Yes, sir.

MR. FIELDING: There are several areas of interest that -I really liked
your comment about these hijackers that gamed the system because anyone
who clings to any vestige of a thought that they did game our system is
wrong and that thinking will not be helpful and productive to fixing
this problem. So I appreciate your comment in that regard. I guess the
most important thing that is of immediate concern is risk management
process and the priorities. You had said in your testimony before the
Senate Approps Committee that TSA and the department as well were
committed -- I think you used the same phrase today -- to the
threat-based risk management plan. And that concerned me originally,
quite frankly because there is much more than threat analysis. There has
to be a consequence analysis. There has to be prioritization over
vulnerability and by vulnerability, it's got to be more than you find a
bad screener, you fire them. I mean -- so I understand from your
testimony that it is much more complete than just the threat based.

MR. LOY: Absolutely.

But I would ask if you could detail for us in a little more than you
gave us, how it is working right now and the status of the plan as you
see it and also I'd be interested to know how you're currently setting
your budgets and your policy priorities, as you're developing the plan.

MR. LOY: Yes, sir. Let me see if I can explain that. The notion of
threat-based and risk-managed, I believe, has to begin with the
secretary, continue with the undersecretaries and those that are in
leadership positions to make good decisions about how we are making
investments, and end with the on line workforce personnel that truly
will make a difference in terms of actually carrying it out. While I was
at TSA, we had a staff that we referred to as our strategic assessment
staff. They were in the business, first of all, of reaching to the
private sector. There was no illusion that some group of feds inside the
building known as TSA headquarters had some kind of a corner on the
market of good ideas about how we would move forward. I, for one, spent
the last six years of my time in uniform developing a public-private
partnership notion that I believe in deeply. I know there are kids alive
on the river systems of this country because of the partnerships that
the Coast Guard entered into with the American Waterways Operators. And
I tried to bring that notion to the TSA with the idea that we would
bring the aviation industry to the table, whether it was through our
advisory council, or whether it was through individual challenges
associated with understanding what this threat-based risk management
notion was all about.

To take them as two phrases, one at a time, on the threat-based end,
sir, it's not like it's about Cold War national security intelligence
community only information that is of value to us. I am absolutely
certain that information is part of the keys to the security locks of
the future, but it's going to be data elements and information pieces
used differently than we've ever used them before. I can see mixing of
traditional national security intelligence data with proprietary private
sector data on manifests and bills of lading that can really give us as
good a clue as possible as to what is in that container, that one of 17
million containers coming at us this year, or the one of seven million
containers coming through our ports this year.

How do we optimize the notion of not finding the needle in the haystack,
because that's counterintuitive to what I think we need to do? If the
notion is one of those containers out of those 17 million, we've got to
find the one, that's virtually an impossible job. But what we can do is
take the haystack off the needle to the point where we then can
concentrate the resources that we do have on those few remaining
containers that we can't put in the fast lane, so to speak, and speed on
through the system.

So the notion of understanding likelihood, criticality and
vulnerability, I think those three notions really are what risk
management is all about. We have spent hours and hours developing what I
think are very good self-assessment tools for industry elements to use,
assessment tools that we would use if we went to those same places and
assessed the industry elements, and our challenge is to put the two
together as complete an information flow, analyzed as thoroughly as
possible, and translate it into tactically actionable information
products on one hand, and critical infrastructure notions about risk
management that takes into account very hard priorities that we have to
make between -- you know, is the bridge in San Francisco more important
than the bridge in New York Harbor? The kinds of judgments that are very
difficult to come by and need a thorough, methodical approach to making
those kind of things happen. That calls for tools and we're in a
business of developing all of those kinds of things, sir.

MR. FIELDING: Let me jump away from that, but thank you. And I may come
back on another line here, but I want to talk a little about CAPPS,
because we've had some testimony at our last hearing, a Professor Marc
Rotenberg, who is the president of Electronic Privacy Information
Center. He voiced his organization's objections to the CAPPS II system.
His objection included that a substantial number of passengers had been
misidentified because of the agency's selectee or no-fly lists, and that
the TSA had failed to conduct the privacy impact assessment that was
mandated by federal law, and that the CAPPS system therefore in his mind
and probably for more other reasons violated the Privacy Act.

Now, you've discussed with us, as you said -- you mentioned one of the
things you feel strongly about is the CAPPS project and how valuable it
is in securing our airlines. So would you give us a sense of where you
are in the balance of these interests and how's it working at this
point?

MR. LOY: Yes, sir. We are -- we find ourselves at a point in the
development of the system where the Congress, through the appropriations
bill for '04 has stipulated eight areas of concern that they would want
GAO to come back and help them understand before they would license us
to go beyond the testing phase of the system. They allowed that the
testing phase could continue but that we could not throw the switch, so
to speak, and turn the system on until they were satisfied with these
eight areas.

These are things like an adequate due process system so that an appeal
could take place if you, as an individual, were kept from boarding an
aircraft and you had no idea why and you truly were innocent of anything
in the wrongdoing side. They want to make certain that the system is
effective, that it works, that the false positive end of the system is
going to be such that it is well within the bounds that we would have it
be. They wanted to have demonstrated its efficacy as a system. They want
to make sure there was an internal oversight board to hold us
accountable for all the privacy elements that are very important.

Sir, I attended and arranged off-sites with Fortune 500 and small
company privacy officers from around the country to truly get an
understanding of what their concerns would be and how we could address
them through the course of the development of our system. We had
off-sites with representatives of EPIC and ACLU and all those
organizations that are concentrated on Fourth Amendment protections and
truly at their heart are trying to make absolutely certain that people
and citizens of the country are not wronged by a system that we would be
developing.

We absorbed all of their commentary and designed two privacy notices,
and I think it's another one of those then and now notions. If you look
at the privacy notice for CAPPS II that went out in January of last year
and then at the one that went out in late July of this year, there are
just dramatic improvements along the lines of what we as a body learned
from all the outreach that we had conducted with the people representing
privacy interests. We narrowed, for example, where there was an
inference that we might keep data for as long as 50 years in the January
announcement, in July, it will never be for more than a couple of days,
and then only on those who had registered as actual terrorists or those
who supported terrorists.

So we learned along the way in the development process, and we have
clarified to the public in public notices the seven or eight basic
parameters of concern that the privacy community always brings to the
table. I think we have probably done as good a job researching and
reaching to privacy interests with respect to CAPPS II as has been done
on any project that I've ever been associated with. So I'm very, very
proud with that outreach. The department has actually hired the first
privacy officer in the federal establishment and she has spent virtually
all of her time working with us on CAPPS II as the initial challenge
that she has taken on.

So as I say, sir, we're very confident that we have developed the kind
of a program that respects the privacy interests of our citizens, and I
for one would never turn it on until that was, in fact, the case. Old
Franklin way back when said, "He who would trade a moment of liberty for
safety, deserves neither." And I think here we are, you know, a couple
of hundred years later discussing the same basic -- having the same
basic discussion. And the honor that we have is to make certain that we
can live up to what was prescribed by the founding fathers.

MR. FIELDING: Well, we appreciate that because obviously we're in a
position to try to -- and under an obligation to try to make
recommendations and so your input into that is valued not only today but
hopefully in the future.

MR. LOY: Yes, sir. Is there anything -

MR. FIELDING: If I can stay with CAPPS II for a minute. You issued an
interim final Privacy Act notice. I'm trying to -yeah, here it is. It
says, "After the CAPPS II system became operational, it is contemplated
that information regarding persons with outstanding state or federal
arrest warrants for crimes of violence may also be analyzed in the
context of this system." Now, that's classic mission creep, and I'd love
your comments on that.

MR. LOY: Yes, sir. I think -- I mean, mission creep usually is not
associated with two data points, it may be associated with something
that is really a trend line going somewhere. The secretary and those of
us who were reviewing the baseline for CAPPS II had the opportunity on
the occasion of producing that privacy notice to make a judgment as to
just what it was that we were trying very hard to, (a) keep off
airplanes terrorists, those who associate with terrorists, foreign or
domestic, and felons with significant warrants against them with a very
prescribed list of offences. That was the judgment call that was taken
by the secretary that those are very, very important things for us to
put our -- you know, to plant our flag around.

I suppose, easily, there could have been a third or fourth or fifth data
point on that trend line that would have suggested it would have been
okay to go all the way to the other end, you know, and deadbeat dads
would also be identified by the process. And we chose to be very
conservative in the alignment that was taken with respect to where those
lines would be drawn. And, of course, that notice, sir, invited
additional commentary and before the -- again, before the system would
be turned on there is a requirement for a final privacy notice to
acknowledge what we have learned and listened to over the course of the
time between the beginning of August, the end of July, this past year
and whenever we would be actually turning it on. In fact, I suppose
there's even conceivably the requirement for more than one: another
interim and a final before we get there, in this ongoing dialogue of
learning what we need to learn.

MR. FIELDING: Right. Well, I just think it's so important. We've
discussed this amongst ourselves that, as important as CAPPS is, that it
not be and its vitality be obscured by other issues.

MR. LOY: Absolutely. It should be as pristine as we can make it, focused
on exactly what we want to use it for.

MR. FIELDING: Just to stay on CAPPS II for another minute, there is the
theory that you're going after and identifying the bad guys and wouldn't
it be better if you tried to figure out a way to identify the good guys?

MR. LOY: And frankly, sir, CAPPS II in large measure does that. I mean,
the fact that -

MR. FIELDING: That's what I wanted to know your comment on, thank you.

MR. LOY: You know, my guess is today, one of the weaknesses of CAPPS I,
in addition to being gameable and compromised, it produces about 14.5
percent selectees. So the challenge of getting through the airport from
a customer service perspective is attendant to 14 or 15 percent of the
people walking into the airport going through secondary screening as a
result of being labeled a selectee by CAPPS I. I am very confident that
CAPPS II will get that percentage down to around 3 or 4 percent and an
infinitesimally small number -- smaller than that ever finding
themselves in the so-called red category. What that really says is 97 or
96 percent of the folks walking through that airport portal will be in
the green category and ushered aboard with the "have a nice flight" sign
as CAPPS II works its magic.

MR. FIELDING: If I can switch gears for just a second, and this may be
one of these areas that we should discuss offline, but can you tell us
where TSA or the department's efforts stand in respect to addressing the
MANPAD or civilian aircraft threat from surface to air?

MR. LOY: I can -- I think I can give you an adequate answer, sir. And
obviously if there is more that you would care to have me provide in a
private setting, I'd be happy to do that. The federal -- or the
government's approach is sort of a three-pronged approach: two that
we're very familiar with from nonproliferation days of the past and one
that everyone sees on the front page and is looking at very carefully.
The first is what I'd call the nonproliferation leg of the stool, which
is to say great effort being undertaken in multilateral and bilateral
means by which we can do whatever is possible to gain control of the
inventory of the 700,000 plus MANPADs that are out there, quote/unquote,
the vast number of which of course are inside military arsenals and
being identified and contained as we speak.

But the gray market/black market reality is that there are thousands
that are unaccounted for in that system and we must be about the
business of trying to gain as much of a handle on those as we can. So
whether those are buy-back programs or destruction programs mutually
agreed upon between two nations; that is one of the elements of the
stool that is very important for us to continue. We're trying to work
those down from the top, if you will, through G8 summit agenda items on
down into all the rest of the nations of the world.

The second stool is basically what I'd call tactical countermeasures,
and that's the identity of doing very good vulnerability assessments at
all the major airports of our country, doing the footprint if you will
that identifies carefully from where could a MANPAD be launched in the
flight, approach and departure path of the aircraft that we're talking
about. And then once that assessment is done, working with the state and
local police officers and law enforcement community to understand that
at different alert condition levels we will require different kinds of
activities associated with being concerned about the MANPAD threat as
one of the many threats to aviation today. We are also assessing a
considerable number of foreign airports for the same reason.

We cannot, I don't believe, take comfort in the fact that virtually all
MANPAD attacks have been in some area where it was war torn, where it
was tribally disruptive, where there was a -not a very nice place to
live and work, so to speak.

MR. FIELDING: I think we've all learned you can't assume since it hasn't
happened once it would never happen.

MR. LOY: Absolutely, sir. And then the third piece is -the other pieces
of tactical are things like what can the pilot do on the approach or on
the takeoff to make a difference? Should he turn his lights off, should
he do this, should he do that? And there's been a very good interchange
with the aviation community, the airlines and the pilots' associations
to help us sort our way through those and offer those back as an
educational package to the airlines and to the pilots. And then lastly
technical countermeasures, which is what is always on the front page.

We have just let three contracts to three different elements from the
S&T, the Science and Technology Directorate at the Department of
Homeland Security, whose purpose it is to identify what the "it" could
be. Total ability to look inside some black box programs in the Pentagon
and see what the potential for retrofitting a version of this
counter-MANPAD technology might be on the aircraft that we have in the
United States. Seven thousand, by the way, airframes roughly. And so
once we figure out what the "it" is, then the subsequent judgment is,
okay, all 7,000? Just the craft fleet? Just those that go to bad places?
How do we sort our way through the one to 7,000 issue that is also on
the table? And, of course, should the per airframe cost sort out to be a
quarter of a million dollars instead of $3 million each, that would
obviously have a bearing on the judgment process as well.

MR. FIELDING: Let me get down in the weeds a little on you, sir -

MR. LOY: More specifically, by the way, on the three contracts and other
aspects of that, I'd be happy to come back in a private setting.

MR. FIELDING: Well, I think we should come back in a private session on
that.

MR. LOY: Yes, sir.

MR. FIELDING: But, as I say, let me get into the weeds a little and ask
a question that probably everybody in this room would like the answer to
because this morning in the paper we see that a woman passed through the
security screening at LaGuardia and she had a stun gun and a knife in
her purse and she didn't discover it. She got on the plane and she
discovered it on the plane and then alerted authorities. And it's not
the first time anybody has read these kind of things -

MR. LOY: Sure.

MR. FIELDING: -- and you say, gee, if we're so darned good, how can that
happen? We have all these rings of protection, we have threat
evaluations. How does this happen? And obviously I don't want you to
answer how it happens and tell somebody how to get by it the next time.

MR. LOY: Yes, sir.

MR. FIELDING: But in fact are records kept of all these such incidents?

MR. LOY: Obviously when we know about them. There are records kept so as
to provide the training appropriate to the team or the individual that
perhaps was responsible for that person going by. But let's back up if I
may, sir, just for a moment and help all of us understand that we looked
very hard. When TSA was stood up, Secretary Mineta -- it was
interesting, from the time ATSA was passed -- the Aviation
Transportation Security Act was passed, until a year later when the
mandated congressional requirement was to have federalized that
workforce.

Secretary Mineta made I thought an enormously courageous decision. He
said, we're going to take six months and figure out how to do this and
then we're going to take six months to do it. He didn't plunge off into
some array of things that people might have been calling for to be done.
He demanded of us that we try as thoughtfully as possible to build -- to
figure out what to build and then to build it. So we looked for the
silver bullet. You know, we looked hard for what the technological
protocol or people related silver bullet might be and frankly, sir, we
never found it. So the default position became the rings of security
notion that you alluded to. Over the course then of the ensuing design
period, and even up to today when we continued to add rings to the
array, we simply tried to take advantage of what might be five or six or
seven or eight, 60 or 70 percent kind of tools and array them in such a
fashion that we took advantage of the law of aggregate numbers.

And if in the law of aggregate numbers one is able to get closer to the
94, five, six, seven kind of notion that we would like to see in our
system for the dollars invested and for the intellectual energy
invested, then that became our default position: to array those
obstacles in a path that the bad guy would have to take in order to get
to the cockpit. So it begins with better perimeter security at the
airport, it begins with better curb security at the terminal building,
it goes on to the checkpoint and tens of thousands of much, much better
trained people on the job at both the checkpoints and in the baggage
rooms.

It includes 100 percent baggage instead of 4 percent baggage in terms of
what it was on 9/11. It includes federal air marshals now flying tens of
thousands of flights each month, when we started this process we had 33
federal air marshals to this country's name. It goes on to hardened
cockpit doors, it goes on to now a training program for volunteer
pilots, popularly known as guns in the cockpit, that is yet another sort
of final notion of defense actually in the cockpit itself.

And it also includes, I would hope, this sense of urgency that I
mentioned in my comments at the beginning. I just -- I am very concerned
as a human being in an organization and a country, we have demonstrated
unfortunately often enough in our past when we can let that surface and
become an unfortunately dominant influence on where we're going. One way
or the other I've got a coin in my pocket that is a little TSA thing and
I'll have in my pocket for the rest of my life.

And I encourage every person that came to work for TSA to find something
that they hang on the kitchen door on their way out every morning that
reminds them of why they have to what they have to do. So it's the array
of that concentric set of rings that is the default position from the
silver bullet that we simply could not find. And again, I point out this
is a journey not a destination, there will never be a day when I can sit
here and tell you with 100 percent certainty the last thing fell into
place yesterday, Mr. Commissioner, and we are good to go. That day will
never come.

MR. FIELDING: But you do keep records of these?

MR. LOY: Oh, yes, sir.

MR. FIELDING: Would those records be available for us to get some sense
of progress of TSA in that sort of thing?

MR. LOY: Of course, sir.

MR. FIELDING: And let me just hit you with one other similar issue. I
guess it was in October when the box cutters were found on the Southwest
Airlines.

MR. LOY: Sure.

MR. FIELDING: At first it appeared as though, gee, this is great, you
know, they got the -- they found them and there was quick coordination
between the FBI and TSA. But then there were enough reports about the
incident that indicated that there may have been some delay between the
time that TSA found out about it and the time the FBI got it. Could you
-

MR. LOY: Yes, sir, a dark day for us. Largely the reporting process on
that one was on us, as it turns out of course, the young man was not a
terrorist, was not a security threat, he was simply trying to
demonstrate that it's possible to get a box cutter on an airplane. The
checkpoints associated with getting passengers and their carry on
baggage on board, that is

\- if that was the silver bullet we wouldn't have needed all those
others, so that too is one of the elements of a system that is going to
have its percentage of success associated with that is other than 100.

But in the specific time orientation associated with the report, our
call center, which had been stood up rather recently, simply had not had
the adequate guidance to it to make certain that a report like that that
looked out of the ordinary got into the right operational hands, if you
will, so something could have been done about it immediately, and that's
exactly what should have happened and it didn't and we fixed it and it's
behind us and if you call the call center today they will recognize the
out of the ordinary call and get it into the right hands immediately.

MR. FIELDING: Thank you, I'm being very greedy with your time so, Mr.
Chairman, I'll turn this over to -- thank you, sir.

MR. KEAN: Thank you, Mr. Fielding.

Commissioner Gorelick?

MS. GORELICK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Admiral Loy, thank you for being here, particularly on this snowy day
when almost everybody seems to have abandoned Washington.

MR. LOY: Everyone else has gone home.

MS. GORELICK: I got to know you when you were commandant of the Coast
Guard. You did superb work outside of your narrow job description, in
counter-narcotics, in dealing with waves of Haitians and Cubans coming
our way, and I saw leadership there that I'm very pleased to know is in
the Department of Homeland Security today.

MR. LOY: Thank you, ma'am.

MS. GORELICK: You remind me of that when you begin your testimony
talking about the need to ensure that we are not complacent. We need
leaders who step up to the plate, who see the whole field and do not
narrowly define their jobs and that's the first topic I want to talk to
you about. Over the last two days and in previous hearings as well I
have been struck by how many people in government narrowly define their
jobs, and in fact define the hard parts out of their jobs, and that
include some agencies that now report to you.

We saw -- well, we saw some heroic behavior in INS and Customs and we
also saw people who shrugged when they saw things that didn't comport
with common sense, which when they saw things that were not in line with
the regulations, and their view was it was not their job to think about
the larger picture. We saw the same thing, frankly, with FAA, they took
a very narrow job of their security role: That is that their job was to
act when someone told them that there was a specific person who might do
harm to an airplane as opposed to looking at the fact that they were in
charge of security for the airline industry. And there was a wealth of
information out there about bad actors who might like to go on our
aircraft, and I find it frankly very shocking and very disturbing. We
saw it in FBI and CIA, in headquarters who saw their job as proving a
service to the field but not to make a whole strategy and make sure that
the field was doing what it needed to be doing against that strategy --
the lack of common sense, the lack of the ability to evaluate the
mission and say what can I do?

So my first question to you is you have inherited a lot of people and
you have inherited a lot of people who -- many of whom have exhibited
these behaviors and you are responsible for our homeland security. So my
question to you is how are you going to change behaviors in an
institution that big and that important?

MR. LOY: It's a -- it is an enormous undertaking. We are -- not to humor
is a way of coping every once in a while and I tell the secretary it's
like walking into the Borders bookstore and going to the management
section and finding thousands of books on mergers and picking one, but
he's got to pick 22. And then he's got to go the other section on
startups and pick the very best book on startups and he's got to read
all those and at the other end of the day be in the business of a 22
agency merger and a startup of 200,000 people and there's no book in
Borders on that. He is writing it as we go.

I believe you have to start with the vision thing. I truly believe that
in order to take, in this instance, agencies like Customs and Coast
Guard with 200 years of service to this country, and I accept your
commentary with respect to any given one of them and their cultural
approach to things, and there are other brand new organizations like TSA
literally wet behind the ears in terms of trying to get something
established. I am of the mind that the President's national strategy for
homeland security is a good solid document, presidential in nature, for
us to begin with.

But our responsibility at the department is to take that challenge
notion that's in that document and interpret it adequately for our
workforce and for the public at large, such that the vision thing is
truly available to all of us to understand. A bit of it is going to be
like the classic instructor who stands in the front of the room and goes
through the notion of telling them what he's got to tell them and then
telling them and then telling them what he told them and then hoping one
out of three, they got the message.

I think a simple core message that is replete with values, replete with
guiding principles that will be crystal clear to every leader and every
workforce member in that department is in order, and the secretary is
about the business of challenging us to produce exactly that. And I
believe somewhere around the occasion of the first anniversary here
coming up, that embarkation on a journey that has associated with it the
right kind of values, the right kind of principles and the absolute
accountability associated with each and every leader and member of the
organization being held to task for his or her portion of that path
forward.

MS. GORELICK: I think that's an excellent segue, if I can interrupt,
into my next question, because you have described and we among us have
described the war we're in against al Qaeda as one that requires a
strategy and accountability and responsibility for carrying it out.

MR. LOY: Yes, ma'am.

MS. GORELICK: I have asked and I will continue to ask every relevant
witness before this commission, who is responsible for establishing
strategy against al Qaeda, long term and day-to-day and directing and
managing all the assets of our government against it? To deprive it of
the means that it needs to undertake to do us harm?

MR. LOY: Well, if you're asking me for a single person, if you're asking
for the last advisor to the President, the president is the guy. The
last advisor to the President is the national security advisor, with
respect to the kind of challenge that you put on the table, and the
pieces that comprise that game plan, that offers its nexus through the
national security advisor to the President, are many of us who are
responsible for various corners of it along the way.

If you're asking me where I fit in and where Secretary Ridge fits into
that, the charter for the Department of Homeland Security is very clear.
I believe that the strategy as exhibited publicly by the President for
that department to do its work is very clear. So getting on with that is
simply the challenge that we all have day in and day out, but if
ultimately you're asking me for one person responsible for this nation's
well-being in that regard, it literally goes to the Oval Office.

MS. GORELICK: Well, that is really too broad. It's both too broad and
too narrow. Let's drill down a little bit.

MR. LOY: Sure.

MS. GORELICK: One of the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland
Security is gathering all of the information about al Qaeda, so that you
know who the enemy is, what its methodology is, and so that you act
against it. That function has been, as I can see it, outsourced to TTIC.
I don't see that function in the Department of Homeland Security. Is my
assessment correct?

MR. LOY: I think your assessment is correct in terms of the TTIC being
established specifically for the responsibility of -- with the
responsibility of gathering all the elements of that threat and making
it available to those that need it. That is absolutely correct. Now, the
connectivity between the information analysis portion of one of our
directorates in the department, we helped to people TTIC, the number two
person at TTIC is from DHS, so the notion associated with what TTIC's
responsibility is, is all about what it does with the product when it
has it completed. And providing that finished product to those agencies
that need it as a basis from which their operations are to ensue, if I
may, just let me continue for just a second.

During the recent orange period, this is a maturing process for all of
us as we go through this and get better and better at it as time goes
by. But through the recent orange alert period, I watched day after day
as TTIC articulated the smallest variants in the threat stream that was
going by from yesterday's analysis and offered that to all of us in the
action oriented departments and agencies to take on the challenges that
would be necessary in our case to secure the homeland and in the case of
others to aggressively follow things overseas.

MS. GORELICK: I was struck though when the deputy director of TTIC
appeared before us yesterday when he said -- and he has told our staff
and it's quite clear he has no operational or collection responsibility,
he is a recipient of stuff gathered by other people. So, again, I'm
looking for who is setting the strategy. You have described the war
against al Qaeda as one in which it's not a cat and mouse game, it is a
serious enterprise and on the last round they beat us.

MR. LOY: Absolutely.

MS. GORELICK: Because they were more focused than we were. And my
concern here actually is in the org chart. You come out of a highly
disciplined organization in the Coast Guard. I saw you in action and I
saw that institution in action. I don't think that we are set up right
now to be highly disciplined because we have the enterprise that is
supposed to be pulling together everything, taking again a very narrow,
in my personal view, view of their job, which is to passively receive
and albeit, you know, aggressively integrate, but receive what is given
to them. It then passes that on to a directorate in the Department of
Homeland Security, which has various tools at its disposal. Some of the
tools in the government are at the CIA, some are at the FBI and I'm not
saying we should amalgamate them in one place, but I want to know who,
on a day to day basis, is saying we got to do this, we've got to do
that, we've got to go here. It can't be the President and it can't be
the national security advisor. I am looking for who that person is.

MR. LOY: And it's not TTIC. What is maybe the -- a bit of the missing
link there is that it is also incumbent on we operators to define
requirements that will enable us to do our job well. I can remember
vividly as -- sometimes it helps to take it to another venue. In the
drug business, in the counterdrug business, before Barry McCaffrey sat
in his chair the notion was always from us, from we operators, finger
pointing in the direction of the intelligence establishment that if only
they gave us what we needed, we would be able to do a much better job
operationally in terms of productivity and the counterdrug effort.

MS. GORELICK: It sounds very familiar.

MR. LOY: Yes, ma'am. And when Barry held us for long hours over long
days and helped us understand that it was only when we had articulated
our requirements well enough to the intelligence community that they
could really adjust themselves to produce things that we declared that
we needed, could we then see dramatic success or improvements in what we
were doing, and that's exactly what we did. So the requirements
articulation piece associated with not only DHS but anyone else outside
of the intelligence community that is feeding TTIC, must be about the
business of articulating the requirements well.

For us it is the requirement set associated with securing the homeland.
That is about predominately a before and after the event notion where
now that we have drafted a national response plan and a national
incident management system that is associated in an all hazards
environment, we must be about the business of articulating carefully the
requirements that we have to do our jobs better. To prevent things from
occurring that we don't want to occur, to protect critical
infrastructure throughout this land in all 14 sectors, in all the key
assets lists that we are inheriting and then in the aftermath, God
forbid, of an actual event, to deal with the response, the recovery and
the consequence management end of what we do for a living. Our challenge
is to integrate that requirement set and articulate it clearly to those
who can give us the wherewithal to do our jobs better.

MS. GORELICK: I appreciate that, and I think that that's an important
step. I know I -- there are fellow commissioners who would like to get
in a question here. I would just leave you with this thought, that the
counternarcotics analogue in some respects falls apart because the
counternarcotics effort operationally, in terms of integration of
information and operations against narcotics organizations and
collection against narcotics operations were consolidated in the
Counternarcotics Center, which merged law enforcement and intelligence
gathering and operations in one place. And what I'm saying to you is, so
far, I haven't seen that with regard to our counterterrorism effort and
it is an open question, at least for this commissioner.

Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Thank you, Ma'am.

Commissioner Roemer.

MR. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Admiral Loy, you have a lot of people that greatly admire you for your
bluntness and candor in where I used to serve in the House of
Representatives and I can see why today we appreciate that honesty. Let
me ask you a quick question about the Homeland Security Council. As
something that many people think is duplicative and not sure what the
purpose is, what do you think? Should this evolve away? Should it be
replaced by something else? What's your opinion on the Homeland Security
Council?

MR. LOY: I guess I have two. The first is -

MR. ROEMER: As long as it's not pro and con.

MR. LOY: No, it's not. Maybe sequenced in time. It seems to me that we
may unnecessarily bifurcate the council to the President by having more
than one council associated with that advisory process. But, on the
occasion of 9/11 and its aftermath, I believe it made very good sense to
concentrate on this notion of homeland security and really sort through
it for whatever length of time it might take to get us to a point that
the thinking powers that be, inside the Executive Branch, would find the
requirement to continue with multiple council to no longer be necessary.

So, at the moment, they serve a very, very good purpose. They are sort
of a challenging element, a filtering element, a sounding board for
ideas that may be forthcoming from any of a variety of places, from
state and local levels, from private sector levels, from within our
department and to this particular point in time, I believe they have
served us as a nation very well. But I can also see x number of years -

MR. ROEMER: So your recommendation might be that their time has come.
They've served and gone and now it's time to -

MR. LOY: No, I didn't say that now is the time. I said that at the
moment they continue to serve us very well in that regard but that there
may be a time in the future where a re-bonding or a regeneration into a
single conduit of councils to the President would be in order.

MR. ROEMER: You talked in your opening testimony about trying to develop
new tools for the trade, which I strongly agree with. How do you feel
specifically about new tools such as a national identification card or
state ID cards? Identity seems to be such an important part, an integral
part of how we move forward in many of these efforts.

MR. LOY: It truly is. All of CAPPS 2 is associated with doing two things
for us, validating identity on one hand and then making a judgment as to
whether that person now that we think we know that they are who they
claim to be should be allowed on the airplane for whatever risk score
they might develop in the system. Many of the things that we're about.
We are working very hard on a transportation worker's identification
credential which has practical value.

Our star is a trucker with 33 different things hanging on his neck or
whatever to get him from point A to point B to do the business of his
rounds. And so, the notion of a biometrically based -- there we go again
with identity authentication -- and access control which are the two
fundamental functions that we are groping with, grappling with day after
day after day can be accommodated with a card that could be provided
with all the means by which he can get to those places he needs to get
to with only one card.

I think there is sort of a national aversion to the general notion of a
national ID card for all that represents in the minds of many. But I am
also very concerned that the things that we now use as a basis for
identity, state drivers' licenses, for example, the myriad means by
which they are dealt out in the 50 different states across the country
and the holes, if you will, that are in there as it relates to identity
authentication, suggest to me that standards associated with the
issuance of identification documents may be the right way for the
federal government to get involved in that process rather than sort of
trying to think our way through all the pits and valleys of a national
identification card.

MR. ROEMER: That's helpful. Commissioner Gorelick asked very artfully
your opinion about how we try to organize this massive lash-up of
various organizations called the Department of Homeland Security. Let me
put it a different way. Don't you think that Congress went too far and
made a mistake in lashing up too many different cultures, too many
different organizations, that it's too big, it's too bureaucratic, it's
too political, it can't get the job done quick enough going against such
a dynamic enemy as al Qaeda and how al Qaeda is going to work against
the United States for the next five years?

And before you answer because I'm sure your answer -- you have to go to
work tomorrow or tonight -- before you answer, just put this in the
context of somebody who still believes that the Department of Energy
which is 26 years old still has real problems functioning as an
organization and a Cabinet-level agency in this town. How in the world
is this Department of Homeland Security going to take on this
commensurate threat? You have this huge bureaucratic organization on the
one hand and this dynamic, agile, fluid organization that moves from
Afghanistan to Pakistan to Indonesia, cells of four people in Berlin,
another cell of six in the Sudan. Are you going to recommend at some
point certain reforms to make this organization work more efficiently?

MR. LOY: There's no doubt, sir, that I think this is a work in progress.
The organizational structure of the department, I think, is relatively
sound. The idea of the four major directorates with a director
associated predominantly with operating agencies and the work that they
are doing, one associated with the science and technology, associated
with an investment in R&D and technological improvement, that is a very
sound organizational element, I believe. One that is associated
principally with the response side of the post-event challenge in EP&R
and one that's associated with predominantly the information and
prevention or the pre-event side of this notion of when the event may
trigger before and after.

I don't know that I'm smart enough, as I sit here today, to have reached
fundamental conclusions as to whether or not it should have been only 16
agencies instead of 22 or 14 or 21 -

MR. ROEMER: You artfully suggested, I think -- you diplomatically
suggested that maybe the Homeland Security Council could evolve, go away
eventually. Is there a part of this that could be merged with a
different department that has a better synergy with a different agency,
that, in retrospect, some of us thought this could have been smaller and
more agile like Secretary Ridge's first assignment in the White House?
How might you help us think this through?

MR. LOY: Well, I think there's probably two things. One would be to
understand the difference between one who is responsible and armed only
with collaborative, coordinative kind of influence as opposed to one who
has direct line authority over the engaged agencies that he is trying to
get to do something. The homeland security advisor is just that, one who
makes an effort to use the bully pulpit of the White House to influence
things one way or the other. The secretary of the department in which
there are these agencies has the direct authority to, as necessary,
direct traffic with respect to what they do. That's one array of thought
that suggests that a Cabinet level department has perhaps a better
ultimate way of having things get accomplished because they have the
line authority to make it happen.

The second thing is to -- I believe goes back again to Commissioner
Gorelick's question about culture, and it has to do with what are those
things that we must value in this brand new department, things like
adaptability and agility and those that you were just describing, and
make absolutely certain that in this white sheet of paper that we have,
you know, in kicking off this new department in this new century, we
design into the development of leadership programs in the department, in
the day-to-day life of executing policy and things in the department,
that those are the things that are valued. We incentivize the process
such that we reward behavior that goes that direction and we don't
reward -- in fact we punish if appropriate behavior that goes the wrong
way.

The enormity of the challenge on one hand to me is offset by the
enormity of the opportunity on the other. And we are literally -- those
of us who have been given this responsibility have a chance to take that
white sheet of paper and create, if you will, a model agency for cabinet
level functionality in the 21st century. And if we do that well, armed
with the authorities that were provided by the Congress -- including
those, for example, that were provided in TSA -- I can tell you that
there is no way, absolutely no way we could have gotten accomplished
what we got accomplished in TSA in two years if it had not been for the
authorities the Congress offered to us in ATSA. I'm talking about
sole-source acquisitions. I'm talking about an

H.R. program where pay banding offered us an opportunity to attract the
very best in the public service because we could give them a couple of
more bucks to do the job we were asking them to do.

It was more than a patriotic zeal that brought people to the department.
They could have gone lots of different places and done their service to
America after 9/11. If they came to TSA it was not only because of that
zeal, it was because we could attract them with a couple of more dollars
associated with the pay banding system that was licensed for us to use.
So in those kind of areas of design where we design the culture of this
organization for the ensuing future, there is enormous opportunity for
us to do that well and we should be held accountable if we don't get
that job done.

MR. ROEMER: Thank you, Admiral, I appreciate that. Are you a baseball
fan?

MR. LOY: I enjoy all sports, sir.

MR. ROEMER: You enjoy all sports. I'm a Cub fan and I'm proud of it.
I've seen my Cubs humiliated -

MR. LOY: You're not the guy that was in the left field stands -

MR. ROEMER: If I was, I sure wouldn't be up here. They would have chased
me off a long time ago. And in 1969 the Cubs lost the pennant to the
Mets, one of our many losses and humiliations. From what I've heard of
that CAPPS program today, I think you said it's been gamed, it's been
compromised, it hasn't worked well -

MR. LOY: CAPPS I.

MR. ROEMER: CAPPS I. I would not name anything CAPPS II. I think I'd -

MR. LOY: (Laughs.) Good point.

MR. ROEMER: -- work on a new name and be like exhorting the children of
this country, in a coaching experience, to play like the Cubs of 1969.
Let's think of something different.

Thank you again, Admiral.

MR. LOY: Great point, sir.

MR. KEAN: Senator Kerrey.

MR. KERREY: Well, take heart, Commissioner Roemer. Every team has a bad
century. (Laughter.)

I don't have -- actually, there's not enough time to go into a lot of
questions so I'm not going to do any questions. I'm just going to add a
declaratory to your own thinking, in addition to having a great deal of
admiration for your career, and I mean nothing that will follow here is
made in a disrespectful fashion, but I'm a skeptic on all this stuff. I
really am. I mean, put me in the ranks of -- just as a citizen, not as a
commissioner here at the moment. I mean, my view is a lot of this new
money we'd have been better off converting into $1,000 bills and
throwing it out the window.

Secondly, I mean I've never been more frightened in the last 18 months.
I mean, every time some new alert comes out about some damned thing, my
wife tells me we ought to move out of New York City. And, look, we made
some terrible mistakes, and actually I'm becoming even more skeptical
about the Department of Homeland Security, although from the standpoint
of good government maybe at some point with all the new authorities
you're talking about, it might make sense. I mean, maybe five years from
now, just from a good government analysis, we'll look at it and we'll
say this was a good thing to do.

But, I mean, all the witnesses that I've heard thus far in my short time
on this commission, I mean, there's just too many of them that are
saying, god, if I'd just had the intel from the CIA, as you were
referencing, Barry.

If the FBI had just told me, or the FBI and the (ECM ?) and -- you know,
I just didn't know what was going on. I had no idea that maybe
terrorists would commit suicide. You know, I had no idea that something
like this could happen. It was unimaginable.

It wasn't unimaginable. We had an Islamic terrorist organization that
was operating right in the United States of America and we allowed it to
happen. They were training in Afghanistan, we let it happen. And once we
stopped doing all that stuff and going after people with a vengeance, it
seems to me that the world has gotten an awful lot safer.

I mean, I tell you, I mean I travel a fair amount, and going to the
airport is no fun. You know, you do have to add to your concentric
circles the one that Commissioner Fielding was talking about, which is
that law abiding passengers like us when we get on the plane, the last
circle is we say, oops, here's the stun gun, Mr. Attendant. Here's the
knife that I got on that I realize I shouldn't have had on. I mean, all
the -- I take my shoes off.

I've got a prosthesis from the Vietnam War. You know, they've got to --
now they practically strip search me to check me out and do all that. I
mean, go fly commercial. I've got friends today that won't fly
commercial any more.

I mean, I hope that TSA doesn't do to Amtrak what it's done to the
airlines. I mean, that's the way I feel, let me just tell you. I just --
from the standpoint of a single individual, I don't feel safer and I
don't feel like -- in part because I don't think we're walking up to the
microphones and saying, all of us made a terrible mistake. We
miscalculated here.

I mean, I heard in earlier panels they said, well, we just didn't
realize these guys were this sophisticated. I mean, get the hell out of
here. They beat the Soviet Union, for god's sakes, in Afghanistan.
That's no small accomplishment.

I didn't realize they could fly a plane. Get the hell out of here.

We sell them fighters and train them how to be a pilot, for god's sakes.
But we don't know -- we didn't realize they could learn how to fly a
plane.

What is that all about, other than denial?

So when I hear this -- I hear people seem sort of chirpy that we've got
it all figured out and it's all going to be better, I just say Jesus. I
mean, you've got to start by saying every single one of us made a huge
miscalculation and it got us into a hell of a lot of trouble. And we've
stopped making that kind of miscalculation and we've stopped blaming it
on somebody else. It's not somebody else's fault.

We made a terrible mistake and we paid a hell of a price for it. And I
just -- I mean, my whole -- I wish you well. I mean, I hope that you and
Tom Ridge are very successful and that you win distinguished service
medals for great service in organizing this department, but I'm still a
skeptic. I'm still skeptical that the whole thing has added much value
to the security of the American people.

MR. LOY: Sir, I thank you for your candor. I could not agree with you
more about the huge mistake. I mean, I'm one who is of the mind that
this complacency thing does manifest itself in organizations and in fact
can manifest itself in nations, and we took a decade off.

We took 12 years off. From the 1989 fall of the Wall and the implosion
of the Soviet Empire, I am of the mind that we, the collective we, took
a big deep breath, found no other superpower across the falter gap to
worry about any more and tended to relax. And strangely enough, we woke
up on the morning of 9/11 not only to get that cold pail of water in the
face very directly, but also to realize that all that stuff that we had
built over the course of the Cold War largely was no longer very
meaningful in this new war that we had to encounter on -- you know, in
this global war on terrorism.

It's not about, you know, the weapon systems, the protocols, the
diplomatic engagements, all the things that were so dramatically
effective for us to outlast the Soviet Union in the Cold War. A whole
new ball game. I mean, a whole new ball game that we have to understand
and build from scratch.

That is our challenge. That is our generation's challenge for this
country.

MR. KERREY: Well, thank you for accepting the challenge and for your
service and -- (off mike.)

MR. LOY: Thank you, sir.

MR. KEAN: Secretary Lehman.

MR. LEHMAN: Thank you, Admiral. You may recall there were hearings a
long time ago when I was secretary of the Navy where there was a push to
put the Coastguard under the Navy, and the Department of Defense put out
a very strong statement that they didn't want that ball. And so I was
called to testify and asked, now, we understand, Mr. Secretary, you
really want the Coastguard and could you give us your frank personal
view on whether the Coastguard should be part of the Navy Department.
And I said, well, I do have a strong personal view on that, Senator, but
I don't agree with it.

And with that caveat, I'd like to ask you -- as you know, there was
quite a strong push up here -- when I say here I mean the Hill -- to
push to have the domestic intelligence function as part of Homeland
Security. In fact, the original authors of that concept had that as the
number one function to organize the department around. Where do you
think domestic intelligence should reside?

MR. LOY: Sir, I think we are learning at the moment. My thought is that
eventually, in a perfect system, domestic intelligence probably ought to
be internalized in the department. That may be a while coming.

MR. KERREY: The Department of Homeland Security?

MR. LOY: Yes, sir. That may be a while coming. But, for example, one of
the things that we have had to do in the stopgap measure business is
both TTIC and TSC, the whole notion of trying to get our arms around a
single watchlist for all of us who have to check things against such a
watchlist and make very difficult decisions, I think it is a proper
weigh point on the way to where it eventually might be housed. To single
it out, stand it up, make it right and then, once it has proven itself
functionally, to consider where the ultimate resting place might be for
something like TSC, for example.

MR. KERREY: Thank you for that surprising frankness.

MR. LOY: Now, that is not to say that for the moment -- and again I go
back to this last month of orange alert condition -and I must say I was
just enormously pleased with what I saw day after day after day several
times a day where principals were modifying stands from the morning and
the afternoon because of new pieces of information going by. A new piece
of analytical product that had come out of TTIC or had come out of the
agency or had come out of the Bureau, or had come out of our shop in the

I.A. side of IIAP. What was enormously gratifying was the sharing
process that took place several times a day to enable us to get on to
where we needed to go.

And that was the key, to me, to license the operators to take those
products and go do something about them. And we did, of course, have
more -- as you know, we always look for credibility and specificity in
intel streams going by and in those instances we had plenty of both. And
so the opportunity for us to reach to international partners, to reach
to the private sector of international partners, airlines, for example,
all of that activity was happening of the moment, of the moment, and it
was a very gratifying process to be part of.

MR. LEHMAN: Thank you.

I've one last question. I was quite surprised to hear from an earlier
panel of airline officials, former and current, to learn that political
correctness is still very much being enforced. And they said that, for
instance, after 9/11 when some 35-38 people were -- pilots declined to
fly them because they suspected they were of a dangerous profile, that
Department of Transportation is now suing them over that ethnic
profiling.

And further, one witness said that current regulations for governing TSA
are that if there are three ethnic persons more of three ethnic -- the
same ethnic profile, selected out for examination, that the carrier will
be fined. And I find after the experience of 9/11 that to continue that
kind of political correctness, that they can't focus their attention on
people that fit the profile when we're in a war against Muslim
fundamentalism, that you look for Muslim fundamentalists, to be idiotic.
Tell me it ain't true.

MR. LOY: It ain't true, sir. I just don't -- having stood the agency up
and operated it for two years, I do not remember any such guidance being
provided. We are -- you know, this profiling thing to me is all about
capital "P" and little "p" and the capital "P" profiling that all of us
have been against, for all the right reasons, in our culture is not to
be confused with profiling with a small p" where we are using a tool to
do whatever is necessary to be safe in terms of putting American
citizens on airplanes flying from Point A to Point B.

I have no recollection of that guidance. I certainly will go back and
take a hard look because I have no recollection.

MR. LEHMAN: Could you run that to ground? I'd appreciate it because they
said categorically that they were being both fined and sued because of
such profiling.

MR. LOY: Yes, sir, I will sure check it out.

MR. LEHMAN: Thank you. Thank you very much, Admiral, for your -

MR. LOY: Yes, sir, Mr. Secretary.

MR. KEAN: Admiral, thank you very, very much. You have lived up to your
reputation and it's a good reputation. Thank you, sir, for being with us
today and this concludes our hearing. The Chair and the Vice Chair will
be available to any members of the press who have questions in room 902
in this building.

MR. LOY: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
