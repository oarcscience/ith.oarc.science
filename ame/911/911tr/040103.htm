						<h4>PROCEEDINGS</h4>

			<p>MR. KEAN:  As we start I want to do

         two things.  One is to make part of the 
 
         permanent record    we have a statement here 
 
         from Senator Lieberman, who sent in a statement

         to make part of our record, and a statement 
 
         from Chris Chez from Connecticut.  We will make

         both those statements part of the permanent 
 
         record.

			<p>I also want to recognize people who

         should have been recognized yesterday, I think, 
 
         because they are absolutely vital to our work.

         Phil Zelikow, our Executive Director who is 
 
         behind me with Chris Kojm, Deputy Director and 
 
         Dan Marcus, who is General Counsel.  They are

         absolutely essential, and will be, to our work.

			<p>I want to recognize, as well,

         Stephanie Kaplan and Tracey Shycoff, who did 
 
         all the work really to put these hearings 
 
         together these two days.

			<p>Our first panel this morning is on 
 
         borders, money and transportation security.

			<p>Let me see, we are missing one person 
 
         I thought was going to be here.  Alright, so 
 
         going in order    no, I'm alright, I am looking

         at the wrong one.

			<p>We start out with Glenn Fine, unless

         you have some sort of order you all would like 
 
         to go in?

			<p>(Pause.)

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Okay, from the U.S. 
 
         Department of Justice.

			<p>MR. FINE:  Mr. Chairman, Mr. Vice 
 
         Chairman, and Members of the National 
 
         Commission, I appreciate the opportunity to

         testify before the Commission about the work of 
 
         the Department of Justice Office of the

         Inspector General on border security issues. 
 
         Both before and after the September 11 
 
         terrorist attacks, we have focused much of our 
 
         resources on these and other national security 
 
         issues in the Department of Justice.

			<p>Today, I will describe findings from 
 
         several of these reviews that examined programs 
 
         in the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

         That agency had responsibility for immigration 
 
         and border security issues until March 1, 2003,

         when it was transferred into the new Department 
 
         of Homeland Security.

			<p>At the outset of my remarks, I want to

         stress that while we have noted serious 
 
         deficiencies over the years in various INS

         operations, this should in no way diminish the 
 
         important work of thousands of INS employees, 
 
         now DHS employees.  Most of them perform

         diligently, under very difficult circumstances, 
 
         and their mission is critical to the security

         of our country.  Yet, our reviews have revealed 
 
         significant problems that left gaps in the 
 
         INS's attempts to secure the nation's borders.

			<p>In one important review, we examined 
 
         the INS's contacts with two September 11

         terrorists   Mohamed Atta and Marwan Alshehhi. 
 
         We investigated how these two were admitted in 
 
         the United States.  We also examined how, six

         months after the terrorist attacks, a Florida 
 
         flight school received notification that Atta

         and Alshehhi's applications to change their 
 
         immigration status from "visitors" to 
 
         "students" had been approved.  The mailing of

         these forms raised serious concerns about the 
 
         INS's tracking of foreign students in the

         United States.

			<p>With regard to Atta and Alshehhi's 
 
         entries into the U.S., the evidence did not

         show that the inspectors who admitted them 
 
         violated INS policies and practices.

			<p>However, our review found that the 
 
         adjudication of their change of status 
 
         applications was untimely and significantly 
 
         flawed.  The INS took more that 10 months to 
 
         adjudicate the applications, well after Atta

         and Alshehhi had finished their training course 
 
         at the Florida flight school.  In addition, the 
 
         INS adjudicator who approved their applications

         did so without adequate information, including 
 
         the fact that they had left the country twice

         after filing their applications, which meant 
 
         they had abandoned their request for a change 
 
         of status.

			<p>We also found that historically the 
 
         INS has devoted little attention to monitoring

         foreign students, and its paper based tracking 
 
         system was inefficient, inaccurate, and 
 
         unreliable.  The new internet based foreign

         student tracking system, called SEVIS,  has the 
 
         potential to dramatically improve the foreign

         student program.

			<p>Last month, the OIG completed a 
 
         follow up review to assess the INS's progress 
 
         in implementing the SEVIS system.  We found 
 
         that while the INS has made progress, the

         system is not fully implemented.  Significant 
 
         deficiencies remain, such as a lack of adequate 
 
         oversight and training of contractors hired to

         conduct site visits of schools, and a lack of 
 
         procedures to identify and refer potential

         fraud for enforcement action.

			<p>In my written statement, I describe in 
 
         greater detail a series of other reviews that

         the OIG has conducted on border security 
 
         issues.  One review examined the INS's efforts

         to prevent illegal immigration along the 
 
         northern border.  Until recently, the INS 
 
         devoted significant resources to deterring

         illegal immigration along the southwest border, 
 
         but did not focus such attention on the

         northern border.  For example, as late as 1999, 
 
         only 311 of the national total of approximately 
 
         8,000 Border Patrol agents were assigned to the 
          northern border.  We concluded that the level 
 
         of illegal activity on the northern border

         clearly exceeded the Border Patrol's capacity 
 
         to respond.

			<p>After September 11, we issued a

         follow up review that found the INS had made 
 
         some improvements to enhance the security of

         the northern border.  However, we concluded 
 
         that increased staffing and resources for the 
 
         northern border continued to be a critical

         need.

			<p>We also have conducted other reviews

         related to border security.  For example: We 
 
         reviewed the INS's record in deporting aliens 
 
         who have been issued final orders of removal.

         We found that the INS removed 92 percent of 
 
         detained aliens with final removal orders, but

         only 13 percent of non detained aliens.

			<p>In addition, we reviewed the Visa 
 
         Waiver Program which allows visitors from 28 
          countries to enter the U.S. without first 
 
         obtaining a visa.  We found that INS inspectors

         did not check passports of all of these 
 
         visitors against the INS's computerized lookout 
 
         system, and that the use of stolen passports

         from some of these visa waiver countries 
 
         presented a serious problem.

			<p>A theme we found repeated in many of 
 
         our reviews was that the INS's information 
 
         technology systems needed significant

         improvement.  Many OIG reviews have questioned 
 
         the reliability of the INS's information

         systems and the accuracy of the data produced 
 
         by them.

			<p>In addition, INS information systems

         are not always integrated with other agencies' 
 
         systems.  For example, the INS and the FBI

         developed their agency's automated fingerprint 
 
         identification systems separately, and full 
 
         integration of the systems remains years away. 
			<p> I also want to mention, briefly, one 
 
         other review that, while not addressing border

         security issues, does relate squarely to the 
 
         Commission's work.

			<p>At the request of FBI Director Mueller

         in June 2002, we initiated a review to examine 
 
         aspects of the FBI's handling of intelligence

         information prior to the September 11 attacks. 
 
         Our review focuses on how the FBI handled an 
 
         electronic communication written by an agent in

         its Phoenix office regarding extremists 
 
         attending flight schools in Arizona.  Our

         review also is examining aspects of the FBI's 
 
         handling of the Moussaoui investigation and its 
 
         handling of other intelligence before September

         11.  I believe the final results of this review 
 
         will be useful to the Commission, and we intend

         to cooperate fully with your review of these 
 
         subjects.

			<p>Based on the significant body of work 
          by the OIG during the last several years, I 
 
         believe there are several broad themes that the

         Commission may want to examine relating to 
 
         border security.

			<p>First, information and intelligence

         sharing among all levels of government remains 
 
         a critical component of the effort to prevent

         terrorist attacks in the United States. 
 
         Without adequate intelligence, the ability of 
 
         front line employees to screen effectively

         those who seek to enter the country is limited.

			<p>Second, our reviews have found that

         the current systems for identifying when aliens 
 
         enter and leave the country are clearly 
 
         inadequate.  Implementing an effective

         entry exit tracking system is a daunting 
 
         challenge that will require substantial efforts

         and a large investment of resources.

			<p>Third, we encourage the Commission to 
 
         focus on the often overlooked issue of human 
          capital.  To fulfill its mission, the 
 
         Department of Homeland Security must have

         sufficiently trained immigration staff and 
 
         supervisors.  Historically, this has been a 
 
         challenge for the INS.

			<p>Fourth, I think it is also important to 
 
         note that timely and consistent processing of

         the millions of benefit applications has been a 
 
         longstanding problem for the INS, and now for 
 
         the DHS.  An enhanced focus on border security

         should not override this important 
 
         service related responsibility.

			<p>And finally, the transfer of the INS 
 
         to the Department of Homeland Security presents 
 
         enormous management challenges.  The transfer

         will not, in itself, resolve the issues I have 
 
         identified today.  Solutions to border security

         issues will require innovation and aggressive 
 
         management oversight.

			<p>In sum, I believe that these border 
          security issues present many potential areas 
 
         for the Commission to examine in the months

         head.  We will be pleased to provide any 
 
         information or assistance to the Commission as 
 
         it performs this critically important task.

			<p>That concludes my statement.  I would 
 
         be pleased to answer any questions.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  I think we will do the 
 
         panel and come back, probably with questions.

			<p>Lee Wolosky from Boies, Schiller &

         Flexner, come in.

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Thank you for inviting

         me to testify before you on the subject of 
 
         terrorist financing.  It is an honor and a 
 
         privilege to be able to appear before you

         today.

			<p>Unlike other terrorist leaders, Osama

         bin Laden is neither a military hero, a 
 
         religious authority, or an obvious 
 
         representative of the downtrodden and 
          disillusioned.  Rather he is a rich financier. 
 
         He built al Qaeda's financial network from the

         foundation of a system originally designed to 
 
         channel resources to the mujahadeen fighting 
 
         the Soviets in Afghanistan the 1980s.

			<p>Thanks to the leadership of the Bush 
 
         administration that network has been disrupted,

         but it has certainly not been destroyed.  And 
 
         as long as al Qaeda retains access to a viable 
 
         financial network, it will remain a lethal threat

         to the United States.

			<p>Like al Qaeda itself, its financial

         network is deliberately compartmentalized, and 
 
         is characterized by layers and redundancies. 
 
         Al Qaeda raises money from a variety of sources

         and moves money in a variety of manners.  It 
 
         runs businesses operating under the cloak of

         legitimacy and criminal conspiracies ranging 
 
         from the petty to the grand.  The most 
 
         important source of al Qaeda's money, however, 
          is its continuous fund raising efforts.

			<p>Al Qaeda's global fund raising network

         is built upon a foundation of charities, 
 
         nongovernment organizations, mosques, Muslim 
 
         community centers, web sites, intermediaries,

         facilitators and banks and other financial 
 
         institutions.  Some whose money goes to

         al Qaeda know full well the illicit and violent 
 
         purposes that it will further.  Other donors 
 
         believe their money will fund legitimate

         humanitarian efforts, but the money is 
 
         nonetheless diverted to al Qaeda.  For years,

         individuals and charities based in Saudi Arabia 
 
         have been the most important source of funds 
 
         for al Qaeda.

			<p>Al Qaeda moves its funds through the 
 
         global financial system, the Islamic banking

         system, and the underground hawala system, 
 
         among other money transfer mechanisms.  It uses 
 
         its global network of businesses and charities 
          as a cover for moving funds.  And it uses such 
 
         time honored methods as bulk cash smuggling and

         the global trade in gold and other commodities 
 
         to both move and store value.

			<p>Following September 11, 2001, the Bush

         administration, building on the policies of the 
 
         previous administration, undertook tactical

         actions to disrupt particular individual nodes 
 
         in the terrorist financial network and 
 
         strategic initiatives to change the environment

         within which terrorists raise and move funds.

			<p>Tactical initiatives include law

         enforcement and intelligence activities, along 
 
         with public designations under the 
 
         International Emergency Economic Powers Act

         (IEEPA) of persons, businesses, and financial 
 
         institutions associated with the financial

         network of al Qaeda and other terrorist 
 
         organizations.

			<p>Since much of the subject matter is 
          highly classified, the effectiveness of 
 
         tactical measures is difficult to determine.

         Clearly, there have been successes, such as the 
 
         recent action targeting the al-Farooq mosque 
 
         just across the East River from here.

         Successes have been made possible due to 
 
         markedly improved law enforcement and tactical

         intelligence cooperation from foreign states 
 
         since September 11.

			<p>By contract, progress in the strategic

         arena, in my judgement, has simply not been 
 
         made a high enough priority.  Far too many key

         countries, including virtually all in the 
 
         Middle East and South Asia, still have in place 
 
         ineffective or rudimentary bank supervisory and

         anti money laundering regimes.  In no country, 
 
         including the United States, are either Islamic

         charities or the underground hawala system 
 
         effectively regulated.

			<p>Fundamentally, U.S. efforts to curtail 
          the financing of terrorism are impeded not only 
 
         by a lack of institutional capacity abroad, but

         by a lack of political will among key foreign 
 
         partners.  Some have a history of ignoring the 
 
         problem.  Some perceive, correctly or

         incorrectly, that the U.S.'s attention on the 
 
         subject has waned.  Some simply disagree with

         the U.S. view of the nature and severity of the 
 
         problem.

			<p>Confronted with this lack of political

         will, the current administration, in my view, 
 
         has not made full use of all relevant and legal

         policy tools at its disposal.  For example, 
 
         punitive provisions of Title III of the USA 
 
         PATRIOT ACT enable the Executive Branch to

         restrict or prohibit access to the U.S. 
 
         financial system for foreign states or foreign

         financial institutions that lack adequate 
 
         anti money laundering regimes.  This powerful 
 
         tool remains unused in a terrorist financing 
          context.

			<p>Finally, I would like to say a few

         words about the war in Iraq, which I support, 
 
         but which I fear may retard progress on these 
 
         critical issues.

			<p>Even supporters of the war must 
 
         concede that the United States has not

         effectively justified the war to many members 
 
         of the international community.

			<p>This state of affairs may set back

         ongoing U.S. efforts to fight terrorism. 
 
         Terrorist financing is a transnational problem

         requiring transnational solutions.  In almost 
 
         all cases, the money trail leads or originates 
 
         overseas.  Curtailing terrorist financing

         therefore requires comprehensive law 
 
         enforcement and intelligence cooperation with

         foreign states.

			<p>Political commitment defines the 
 
         nature and scope of that cooperation.  An 
          internationally unpopular war may make the 
 
         necessary commitment more difficult.

			<p>At the same time, the diplomatic 
 
         imperatives of fighting a war in Iraq may have 
 
         bumped terrorist financing down the bilateral

         agenda with critical front line states.  By all 
 
         external indications, the Saudis and other

         front line states have not taken sufficient 
 
         steps to change the strategic environment that 
 
         funds extremism.  Appropriate regulation of

         charities, hawala and the formal banking 
 
         system, along with the reining in of the

         madrassa educational system, among other 
 
         things, requires a fundamental commitment to 
 
         long term structural reform.  While laws,

         regulations and decrees are difficult to come 
 
         by, there is no credible evidence that

         comprehensive structural reform is taking 
 
         place.

			<p>And yet we do not appear to be holding 
          the Saudis' feet to the fire.  Rather than 
 
         speaking out loudly and forcefully about their

         and other states' failure to take steps 
 
         necessary to assure U.S. security, the United 
 
         States remains publicly silent on these issues,

         no doubt captive to the near term diplomatic 
 
         imperatives of waging war, and assuring the

         basing and overflight rights, along with the 
 
         petroleum production commitments, that are 
 
         necessary or desirable in connection with that

         undertaking.

			<p>Thank you very much.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Mr. Dillingham is from 
 
         Civil Aviation and General Accounting Office.

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

			<p>Mr. Chairman, Vice Chairman Hamilton, 
 
         Members of the Commission, thank you for

         inviting GAO to participate in this very 
 
         important national forum.

			<p>As many of you know, GAO is the 
          investigative arm of the United States 
 
         Congress.  Over the years our reports have been

         a key source of information about the security 
 
         of the nations transportation system.

			<p>In June of 2000 we reported that the

         terrorist threat of attacks using aircraft was 
 
         a persistent and growing concern for the United

         States.  The report also said that the trend in 
 
         terrorism against targets was towards large 
 
         scale incidents designed for maximum

         destruction, terror and media impact.  Fifteen 
 
         months later 9/11 happened.

			<p>Mr. Chairman, I have submitted a 
 
         formal statement, for the record.  This morning 
 
         I would like to summarize that statement around

         two questions.  First, how has transportation 
 
         security changed since 9/11?  And second, where

         do we go from here?

			<p>Regarding the first question about 
 
         changes since September 11.  Overall I think 
          the nation has come a long way.  Before 9/11 
 
         security was never treated as a national

         priority and it had never gotten the kind of 
 
         attention or resources that it receives today. 
 
         We now have a federal agency whose primary

         mission is ensuring security for all modes of 
 
         transportation.  That agency is the

         Transportation Security Administration.  TSA is 
 
         the largest agency within the new Department of 
 
         Homeland Security.

			<p>During the first 18 months of its 
 
         existence the primary focus of TSA has been in aviation 
 
         security.  Before 9/11 the airlines, the 
 
         airports and the federal aviation

         administration were all in charge of some 
 
         aspect of aviation security.  Unfortunately, as

         is often the case, when everybody is in charge, 
 
         no one is really in charge and things can and 
 
         did fall through the cracks. 
			<p> Prior to 9/11 the very critical task 
 
         of passenger and baggage screening, what was

         referred to as the last line of defense, was 
 
         being handled by persons who were not properly 
 
         trained, who were not properly supervised,

         whose salaries were not even competitive with 
 
         the salaries of nearby fast food restaurants,

         and who had probably got the job less than six 
 
         months.

			<p>Now most of the security screeners have been

         federalized.  The question is whether screening 
 
         is better because the staff are now federal

         employees.  I submit to you that screening 
 
         probably is better, but not because workers are 
 
         federal employees.  Screening is better because

         the workers are more skilled, because they are 
 
         receiving a decent wage and because they are

         getting better training and supervision.

			<p>However, I want to point out that the 
 
         TSA reports that since it took over screening 
          they have confiscated literally millions of 
 
         prohibited items.  I know that you have seen in

         the media, earlier on, about knitting needles 
 
         and scissors and things of that nature.  We are 
 
         not talking about those kind of things.  We are

         talking about over a million knives and box 
 
         cutters.  We are talking about more than a

         thousand firearms.

			<p>Since 9/11 there is a long list of 
 
         security initiatives that have been undertaken.

         Some of which are classified and some of which 
 
         are widely publicized, such as all baggage

         being screened before it goes on the aircraft, 
 
         the installation of reinforced cockpit doors, 
 
         and the presence of thousands of Federal Air

         Marshals.

			<p>In spite of all that has been

         accomplished, there are still vulnerabilities 
 
         and occasional lapses in the aviation security 
 
         system.  The system is far from perfect and a 
          hundred percent secure.  I submit to you that 
 
         occasional lapse will probably continue to

         occur.  The goal should be perfection, but 
 
         there should also be a recognition that 
 
         perfection is not attainable.  The question is,

         are we doing as much as practicable to move 
 
         towards that goal?

			<p>I think for the most part the answer 
 
         is yes.  With most of the goals that Congress 
 
         set for TSA regarding aviation security now

         behind them, TSA is in the very early stages of 
 
         working with the other transportation modes to

         enhance security in those modes.

			<p>Unlike the direct and pervasive role 
 
         it played with regard to aviation, TSA

         envisions serving more as a transportation 
 
         system security manager for the other modes.

         TSA will establish security standards and 
 
         facilitate coordination and collaboration 
 
         across the six transportation modes.  TSA has 
          also provided some relatively small amounts of 
 
         money to the other modes for security projects.

			<p>For the most part, state and local 
 
         authorities and the private sector, in 
 
         collaboration with a variety of federal

         agencies, such as the Coast Guard, Customs and 
 
         federal law enforcement agencies, have been

         responsible for as much of what has been done 
 
         to improve security in the other modes.  These 
 
         improvements have largely been a few new

         security initiatives or increased frequency of 
 
         existing activities.

			<p>The new initiatives are activities 
 
         such as conducting vulnerability assessments, in 
 
         establishing first response teams.  The

         increased frequency type activities includes 
 
         things like additional training for emergency

         preparedness and revising emergency plans and 
 
         conducting emergency drills.

			<p>The bottom line is that actions are 
          being taken and some progress is being made 
 
         towards securing the nation's transportation

         system.  But what could be considered as 
 
         constituting an effective overall multi modal 
 
         transportation security environment, may very

         well be years away.

			<p>Turning to our last question.  Where

         do we go from here and how do we get there?

			<p>The nation faces a very difficult and 
 
         resource intensive task to secure the

         transportation system.  I would like to offer 
 
         some thoughts and observations of where we need

         to go to move closer to the goal.

			<p>First, we must recognize that it is 
 
         not possible to anticipate and counter every

         risk.  Priorities must be assigned with time 
 
         and money devoted to those threats and hazards

         that are best established and most likely to 
 
         cause the most harm.  In short, we need to plan 
 
         and act strategically. 
			<p> Second, effective coordination must be 
 
         established among the many public and private

         entities responsible for transportation 
 
         security.

			<p>Third, terrorists are creative.  We

         need to address a significant proportion of our 
 
         energies to identifying possible new terrorist

         risks and threats rather than simply preparing 
 
         for the last type of attack that occurred.  And 
 
         in the final analysis, transportation security,

         which is crucial to our nation, it must be 
 
         considered in the larger context of other

         national priorities and weighed and supported 
 
         accordingly.

			<p>Mr. Chairman and Members of the

         Commission, this is very much a 
 
         work in progress and much needs to be done.

         The GAO stands ready to help.

			<p>Thank you very much.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you, Mr. Dillingham. Commissioner Gorelick.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  Thank you, Mr.

         Chairman.  I would like address my first couple 
 
         of questions to Inspector General Fine.

			<p>First of all, I would like to say we

         have a very able and talented public servant in 
 
         Glenn Fine.  We are very happy to have you here

         today, and very pleased that you are doing your 
 
         job in the Justice Department.

			<p>First question, I understand that the

         CIA launched an internal review immediately 
 
         after 9/11 of its conduct before 9/11.  Did the

         Justice Department do the same thing?

			<p>MR. FINE:  No.  The Justice Department 
 
         did not do a broad after action report similar

         to what you describe with the CIA.  Initially 
 
         the Justice Department deferred to the Joint

         Intelligence Committee which was doing a broad 
 
         review that looked at the actions of various 
 
         Federal Government agencies, including the 
          Justice Department and others.  After that, it 
 
         has deferred to this Commission to do that broad

         review.

			<p>However, also the Inspector General, 
 
         Department of Justice, my office, has done a

         series of reviews on national security issues, 
 
         some of which I describe in my report in my

         written testimony, others on the FBI.

			<p>In addition when we have been 
 
         confronted with particular issues such as the

         Atta and Alshehhi visa issue or change of 
 
         application issue, we have done reviews on

         that.  In June, as I mentioned, of last year at 
 
         the request of Director Mueller we launched a 
 
         review on how the FBI handled the intelligence

         information related to the September 11 attacks. 
 
         So we are doing that kind of review.  But the

         broad after action review similar to the CIA has 
 
         not been undertaken by the Justice Department 
 
         itself. 
			<p> MS. GORELICK:  Thank you.  My second 
 
         question is this.  As I read your report, I see

         very different reviews occurring for a 
 
         foreigner who wants to come into this country 
 
         as a student, depending on what route he takes.

			<p>So could you contrast, for example, a 
 
         foreigner who wants to come into this country

         as a student, but who applies for a visa in a 
 
         visa waiver country, comes in as a visitor and 
 
         then tries to change his status to a student

         status, which would allow him to stay longer, 
 
         versus, someone who applies to be a student

         from a non waiver country and goes through the 
 
         consular process for a student waiver.  Could 
 
         you describe the two?

			<p>MR. FINE:  Sure.  It is a different 
 
         review process.

			<p>For the student who applies abroad in 
 
         his or her own country, they have to show ties 
 
         to the country, their own country, and show an 
          indication that they will return to the country 
 
         afterwards.  They have to show financial means,

         they have to show that they have been accepted 
 
         at an accredited school in the United States, 
 
         and normally, although not always, they

         normally go through an interview process with 
 
         consular officer.  As a result they get a

         student visa.  They come to the United States. 
 
         They present the visa to the immigration 
 
         inspector at the port of entry, and they enter

         into the United States and take up studies.

			<p>That is a different process than a

         foreign student who did not get visa abroad but 
 
         who comes to the United States on a visitor 
 
         visa or who may come to the United States

         without a visa because they are from one of the 
 
         28 visa waiver countries.  So they enter the

         United States either with a visitor visa or 
 
         without a visa from a visa waiver country, and 
 
         in the United States they then apply to change 
          their status to student.

			<p>In the United States it is largely a

         paper process.  They fill out the I 589 form. 
 
         They show they have been accepted by a school. 
 
         They show financial means, and then the INS

         adjudicates their status on paper without an 
 
         interview.  Also, prior to September 11, as we

         found in the Atta and Alshehhi case, without 
 
         even checks of the database that would show 
 
         what their status was when they applied to the

         United States.  So it is a different process 
 
         depending on which route they take.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  So if you are clever, 
 
         you can figure out a way to come into this 
 
         country and stay for a substantial period of

         time without anyone ever interviewing you as to 
 
         the appropriateness of that occurring?

			<p>MR. FINE:  It is possible to do that.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  Has that changed since 
 
         September 11? 
			<p> MR. FINE:  It has not markedly changed 
 
         since September 11, particularly from the visa

         waiver countries.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  Mr. Dillingham, did you 
 
         want to add something?

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Yes, I did.  To the 
 
         best of our knowledge, the State Department is

         denying student visas to people who want to come in to 
 
         study flying in the United States.  That, in 
 
         fact, has changed.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  I'm glad to hear that.

			<p>One other general question for you,

         Mr. Fine.  What is the state of connectivity 
 
         between the intelligence community and INS 
 
         today, INS either at the Justice Department or

         at the Department of Homeland Security?  How 
 
         much information flows between the Intelligence

         Community and those who are guarding our 
 
         borders and vice versa?

			<p>MR. FINE:  Connectivity is better than 
          it was in the past.  Now immigration inspectors 
 
         and INS officials do connect through their own

         databases, through the interagency or board 
 
         information system to State Department
 
         databases, the class database, tip off systems,

         and in those databases is intelligence 
 
         information provided by intelligence agencies.

			<p>In addition, the INS has more direct 
 
         contacts with the intelligence agencies through 
 
         their Office of Intelligence.  However, the

         information is often unclassified, often 
 
         sometimes vague and not in a particular usable

         form, we have been told by some immigration 
 
         inspectors.  I think that is a critical issue, 
 
         that this Commission and the government needs

         to look at.  The connectivity of information. 
 
         The integration of the systems and the ability

         to get usable information, usable intelligence 
 
         information to the front line employees who 
 
         need to use that information to screen people 
          who come to the United States.  Without that it 
 
         is an enormously difficult job that they do.

			MS. GORELICK:  Thank you very much.

			MR. KEAN: Mr. Gorton.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  Mr. Fine, assuming that 
 
         in 2001 the INS have been substantially better 
 
         funded, maybe twice as much money, and equally

         more efficient in carrying on its duties.  How 
 
         many of the 19 hijackers could have been in the

         United States or would have perfectly valid 
 
         first entry into the United States, in any 
 
         event?

			<p>MR. FINE:  That actually, I think, is 
 
         speculative and I can't really answer that

         question.

			<p>What we do know is that many of them, 
 
         most of them, entered into the United States

         with valid visas and the immigration inspectors 
 
         did not have any information or intelligence

         that would change the outcome of their 
 
         inspection of them.

			<p>So for that it is hard to say what the 
          difference would have been had the INS been 
 
         better funded or had more information, but I do

         think it is an important issue that needs to be 
 
         addressed going forward.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  I take it then that most,

         if not all of them, could at least have had a 
 
         first entry into the United States as visitors

         even if the INS had been much more efficient?

			<p>MR. FINE:  That's correct, and really 
 
         the issue there is the State Department.  The

         State Department's interviews of them, giving 
 
         visas to them, and my understanding is   

			<p>MR. GORTON:  But they wouldn't have 
 
         required interviews at all if they were just 
 
         coming here first as tourists, would they?

			<p>MR. FINE:  Pardon me?

			<p>MR. GORTON:  Would they not have

         required interviews at all if they were just 
 
         coming here first as tourists?

			<p>MR. FINE:  From some countries they 
          would have, yes.  From the visa waiver 
 
         countries they wouldn't have required

         interviews.  But many of them came from non 
 
         visa waiver countries such as Saudi Arabia and 
 
         elsewhere, where they did require interviews.

			<p>The Inspector General of the 
 
         Department of State has looked at that and from

         my understanding of it, has indicated that 
 
         there were some gaps in the processing of those 
 
         19 terrorists for their visas, but that's an

         issue for the State Department's Inspector 
 
         General.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  The question is basically 
 
         leading to this.  I think you have pointed out 
 
         very eloquently, particularly in your written

         statement, the INS or any similar agency 
 
         doesn't exist simply to keep people out.  It

         exists in order to let the right people in, 
 
         whether they are tourists, full time 
 
         immigrants, doing business here, or anything 
          else.  One of your statistics is 500 million 
 
         particular contacts at one time or another.

			<p>So I guess my question is, how much 
 
         can we realistically expect to increase safety 
 
         and the exclusion of dangerous aliens simply by

         a more efficient bureaucracy or homeland 
 
         security agency, and how uch for providing for the safety

         of the people of the United States, is on the 
 
         laps of Congress perhaps to make different 
 
         policies and to make the system less complex

         and easier to administer than it is.

			<p>Does the Department of Justice have

         views on that subject?

			<p>MR. FINE:  Well, I am not sure I can 
 
         speak for the Department of Justice per se, but

         I do believe the issues need to be addressed at 
 
         all levels.  It can't simply be looking at the

         INS and the end product of the process, saying all 
 
         the onus or burden goes upon them.  There does 
 
         have to be a look at how to allow the flow of 
          travellers and commerce across our borders, but 
 
         in a way that attempts to screen out ones who

         shouldn't be here.

			<p>Perhaps through trusted traveller 
 
         lanes, or ways to increase the ability of cargo

         to be inspected in advance.  So that is an 
 
         important issue.  There are policy issues that

         the United States Congress has to look at as 
 
         well.

			<p>What we have looked at is the INS's

         aspect of it and we have found deficiencies.  I 
 
         am not saying that is the sole problem in

         protecting our country.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  One more question of that 
 
         nature, you spoke of the 28 visa waiver

         countries in your written testimony, at least. 
 
         You speak to the fact that there is a great

         deal of theft of passports from those 
 
         countries.  Of course they are, in a sense, 
 
         valid passports.  Is there any practical 
          solution to that problem?  Obviously from very 
 
         friendly countries a visa waiver is probably a

         good policy decision, but how do we prevent the 
 
         misuse of visa waiver passports?

			<p>MR. FINE:  I think there are several

         ways to do that.  One is to ensure that those 
 
         countries have better accountability of their

         passports, and if their passports are being 
 
         stolen we might want to look to see whether 
 
         those countries should remain in the visa

         waiver program.

			<p>Secondly, once those passports were

         stolen they have to be reported so that the 
 
         numbers of those passports can be entered into 
 
         lookout systems, and when someone travelling

         with that passport shows up at a port of entry, 
 
         an INS inspector can check the database, see

         that it's a stolen passport, see that it is 
 
         illegitimate and stop that person.

			<p>What we found in our reviews is that 
          foreign countries sometimes   

			<p>MR. GORTON:  How are we going to

         determine whether the passport was stolen?

			<p>MR. FINE:  By the foreign country 
 
         having clear internal controls about passports.

         They know they are missing, they know they are 
 
         stolen.  They report it to the United States.

         It is entered into a look out system, and then 
 
         we can stop people trying to use those 
 
         passports.  That's what happens, but we found

         that is not happening on a consistent basis and 
 
         in come cases the INS inspectors didn't even

         check the look out systems to determine whether 
 
         the passport had been reported as stolen.  That 
 
         is one thing that we can do.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  Let me follow up on 
 
         that and then move to more questions of Mr.

         Wolosky and Mr. Dillingham.

			<p>The INS, as I understand from your 
 
         report and my own experience, has utilized 
          biometric measures for the identification of 
 
         individuals trying to come into this country

         which, obviously, are harder to forge than a 
 
         passport, and certainly harder to steal.

			<p>Do you see a future in the utilization

         more broadly of biometric measures as a form of 
 
         identity checks at our borders?

			<p>MR. FINE:  Yes, I do.  I think it is 
 
         critical.  Names can be changed.  Names can be 
 
         misspelled.  Names are not a full enough

         identifier.  There does need to be some use of 
 
         biometrics to ensure that the person showing up

         at the border is the person that received the 
 
         visa, and also that the person is who he or she 
 
         says he is.

			<p>So, yes, biometrics are clearly needed 
 
         to be incorporated into our identification

         systems.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  Finally, you have 
 
         raised serious questions about the visa waiver 
          program.  In your professional opinion, should 
 
         that program be continued?

			<p>MR. FINE:  I think the visa waiver 
 
         program does have significant benefits.  It is 
 
         a policy question whether those benefits

         outweigh the costs, and I am not in a position 
 
         to say that the program should be discontinued.

         But I do think the countries that are in it 
 
         should be carefully screened and held 
 
         accountable to ensure that the appropriate

         measures, that its passports are not being 
 
         fraudulently used.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  Have we ever picked up a 
 
         suspected terrorist who came here on a stolen 
 
         passport from a visa waiver country?

			<p>MR. FINE:  Yes, we have.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  I would like to ask Mr.

         Dillingham a couple of questions, not just 
 
         about aviation security, but as I understand 
 
         it, you previously were director of physical 
          infrastructure issues, generally, at the GAO.

			<p>There have been published reports that

         the Transportation Security Administration has 
 
         poured, in fact, more resources into aviation 
 
         security than perhaps we are needing at the

         moment.  Yet we hear that there is not the same 
 
         degree of attention being paid to our ports, to

         container shipments, to bridges, to tunnels. 
 
         And as you have said, if everyone is in charge, 
 
         no one is in charge.

			<p>You have contrasted the way in which 
 
         TSA is approaching its role in aviation

         security with what, I think you have described 
 
         as, a more management role setting standards, 
 
         creating a collaborative role with all of the

         many parties who have responsibilities for all 
 
         of these other transportation modes.

			<p>Could you comment on whether the 
 
         resources are adequate to maintain and increase 
 
         our security in these other areas of 
          transportation, and whether the management 
 
         structure that you have described is adequate?

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Yes.  I think, 
 
         without a doubt, there has been 
 
         disproportionate resources applied to aviation.

         Aviation is different from the rest of the 
 
         modes in that there was a Federal, a large

         Federal presence associated with aviation prior 
 
         to 9/11.  It was, of course, the FAA.

			<p>The other modes are also different in

         their characteristics. Mass transit, for 
 
         example, is very hard to secure because of the

         nature of it.  It's large, it has to be open. 
 
         There are lots of ways to get into it.

			<p>Ports, a huge undertaking needs to be

         done, but there is also this sort of mix of 
 
         stakeholders, local, state and federal players

         with regard to some of these other modes of 
 
         transportation.  Clearly, there is a gap 
 
         between what has been done for aviation and 
          what needs to be done for the rest of the 
 
         modes.  Money is a big issue.

			<p>Just by example, we came up from 
 
         Washington on the Amtrack.  We came through a 
 
         very heavily populated northeast corridor, and

         to my knowledge there was no metal detector 
 
         check.  There was no screening to speak of, and

         we pulled in under Penn Station.

			<p>That could have been a very bad 
 
         situation.  A situation that occurred in

         Baltimore a year or so ago with a chemical fire 
 
         on a freight train.  All of this points to the

         notion that there are definite gaps, whether 
 
         there are going to be enough resources to 
 
         address that is a real question.

			<p>What the TSA is doing now is, trying 
 
         to establish what are vulnerabilities

         associated with these various modes, and to 
 
         move from there.

			<p>The management structure you ask 
          about, I think there is no way that it can be 
 
         the same as with aviation.  Aviation was

         mandated by legislation, so I think the 
 
         coordination and the collaboration and the 
 
         structure that TSA is trying to put in place

         is, in fact, a good first step and it is 
 
         probably a logical step to take in terms of

         managing.

			<p>It will still be a case where    well 
 
         it wouldn't be a case where no one is in

         charge.  TSA will be in charge by statute. 
 
         They are in charge of all transportation

         security.  They will, therefore, have a 
 
         statutory basis to coordinate and for 
 
         cooperation and setting standards across the

         system.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  Well, Mr. Dillingham,

         if I might make an observation.  Before 
 
         September 11, 2001, the GAO and other agencies 
 
         made numerous reports about the vulnerability 
          of our aviation security system.  And the 
 
         response was often, you need to understand how

         disperse power is.  There are various entities 
 
         with various responsibilities.  There are local 
 
         transportation authorities.  There is the

         aviation industry, et cetera, and of course, 
 
         this is very costly, and trying to figure out

         who bears the burden is very complicated.

			<p>That sounds actually quite similar to 
 
         what we are hearing now about transportation

         outside the aviation security arena.  I am 
 
         prepared to concede that there is a lot of

         complexity, but I wonder whether we have the 
 
         same urgency being brought to bear around our 
 
         ports, in particular, around container

         shipments in particular, around the security of 
 
         our bridges and tunnels, and whether you, having

         broad experience and lengthy experience in this 
 
         area, feel that we have the right level of 
 
         effort and the right structure being brought to 
          bear.

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  I think the process

         that is in place is the necessary process. 
 
         That is, to determine what's important.  This 
 
         is all being done on a risk assessment basis,

         meaning that the TSA is looking across all 
 
         modes trying to see what the vulnerabilities

         and the threats are, and then to prioritize 
 
         that across all threats and across all modes. 
 
         Because, as I said in my statement, there is no

         way that we, as a country, can secure against 
 
         all risk.  So we have to prioritize and we have

         to prioritize according to what the threat is 
 
         and the likely harm that would come if that 
 
         threat is in fact realized.

			<p>I think ports are high on the agenda. 
 
         Right now, only two percent of the thousands of

         containers that come into the country are 
 
         physically inspected, but neither the 
 
         technology nor the manpower is available to 
          inspect 100 percent of them.  But we are moving 
 
         in the direction of getting better technology

         and finding ways, both internationally and 
 
         domestically to address the issue.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  Mr. Dillingham, you were

         very optimistic about the degree of progress we 
 
         have made since 9/11 with respect to air

         transportation.  First, I just wanted to make 
 
         sure, you talked about six modes, have I got 
 
         the other five right, car, train, mass transit,

         bus and maritime?  Would those be the other 
 
         five?

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Yes, sir.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  Which of those five is 
 
         the highest priority and the greatest threat,

         as far as you are concerned, from the point of 
 
         view of moving in the direction of the degree

         of progress we have made with airlines.

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  I think ports.  I 
 
         think maritime because maritime cannot only be 
          a place of substantial infrastructural damage, 
 
         but it can have cascading effects on the

         economy.  We can see when our ports were closed 
 
         for a very short time a few months ago, how 
 
         that effected the economy and international

         commerce.  So I think ports are probably the 
 
         next highest priority, and probably highest in

         terms of vulnerability as well.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  One other question, if I 
 
         may, both for you and for Mr. Fine.

			<p>How would you characterize the 
 
         cooperation of the commercial airlines

         themselves in connection with air 
 
         transportation safety?  That question is for 
 
         you.  And the question for you, Mr. Fine, with

         respect to tracking emigrants and immigrants 
 
         from the United States?

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  When you say their 
 
         cooperation with regard to safety could you say 
 
         more.  What do you mean? 
			<p> MR. GORTON:  The whole TSA attempt, 
 
         which you characterized as being pretty

         successful so far, would you characterize all 
 
         or most of the airlines as being highly cooperative 
 
         with the safety measures or reluctant from time

         to time?

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  I think the airlines

         are    it is probably both.  The airlines, of 
 
         course, are in some economic distress.  So the 
 
         airlines will often sort of push back with

         regard to at least paying for some of the 
 
         security measures that are being put in place

         and they see them as unfunded mandates.

			<p>However, the airlines on the other 
 
         hand recognize that if the flying public do not

         believe that security is much improved, the 
 
         flying public will not come back and the

         airline industry will suffer even greater 
 
         economic woes, which in turn has a cascading 
 
         effect on the rest of the economy. 
			<p> MR. GORTON:  How about with tracking 
 
         people?

			<p>MR. FINE:  I think it is mixed.  I 
 
         don't think that they have been uncooperative. 
 
         I do think that there are issues regarding the

         collection of departure cards, I 94, and 
 
         whether they are universally collected and

         provided to the INS.  They are clearly not.

			<p>There are also issues with regard to 
 
         airport facilities, inspection facilities,

         ensuring that they are safe and secure.

			<p>In the end, though, it is a Government

         function to ensure that it is handled 
 
         appropriately.  I think the onus is on the 
 
         federal government to ensure that whatever

         needs to be done is done.  And I think that's 
 
         where the answer lies.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  Mr. Wolosky, we had a 
 
         witness here yesterday who basically said that 
 
         there is so much money, as he put it I think, 
          "sloshing around" in the Islamic charitable 
 
         community, and so relatively little of it is

         needed, if you will, to successfully fund 
 
         terrorism, that the ability to squeeze out the 
 
         part that has been siphoned off to support

         terrorism activities is extremely challenging, 
 
         let's say.  Could you give us your assessment

         of that?  After all, you said we need to do 
 
         that.  We need to identify those sources of 
 
         funds and eliminate them.

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Sure.  First, I 
 
         absolutely think it is true that there is a

         very large amount of money as you said, or as 
 
         the witness said "sloshing around"  through 
 
         that system.  In part because it is actually

         one of the five pillars of Islam, Zacat, to 
 
         give at least 2.5 percent of your income to

         charitable endeavors.  That is collected both 
 
         through retail charities, at mosques and Muslim 
 
         community centers, and through larger 
          donations, typically by Gulf Arabs.

			<p>But particularly when it is given at

         mosques and Muslim community centers, again, 
 
         like the mosque across the river, it is 
 
         frequently collected by a community leader.  It

         is co mingled.  It is dispersed at the 
 
         discretion of the community leader, most

         frequently without any record keeping or any 
 
         accountability.

			<p>But I don't agree with the premise that

         just because a large amount of money moves 
 
         through that system that the United States

         should not take steps to regulate that activity 
 
         within its own borders.  Nor do I agree with 
 
         the premise the United States should forego

         instruments of foreign policy to compel other 
 
         states in which this activity occurs to engage

         in similar regulatory efforts.

			<p>I think that there are really two 
 
         reasons to take such action, notwithstanding 
          the fact that a relatively small amount of 
 
         money can contribute to devastating terrorist

         attacks.

			<p>The first is that where particular 
 
         nodes are identified, you actually can take

         steps to prevent attacks from occurring by 
 
         choking off the financing.

			<p>Secondly, to the extent that you force 
 
         systemic changes, you make it harder for 
 
         terrorists to raise and move money.  To the

         extent that you achieve that objective, you are 
 
         forcing them to spend more time worrying about

         how they are going to raise and move money, 
 
         than spending time and effort on planning and 
 
         executing deadly attacks.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  Thank you for that 
 
         response.  I think it will help us as we

         consider the kind of factual inquiry we need to 
 
         be making here.

			<p>You raised, I think, two fairly 
          dispiriting points.  One is that the issue of 
 
         attacking the sources of terrorism funding has

         moved lower on the bilateral foreign policy 
 
         agenda.  And also, that the necessity for some 
 
         international rubric for attacking terrorist

         financing has been undermined by the lack of 
 
         international consensus for this effort.

			<p>I was struck by the fact that in 
 
         November of '02, when you did your report, you 
 
         actually observed that while immediately in the

         aftermath of 9/11 there was a lot of 
 
         international cooperation, you said, "that

         coalition may be fraying" and you noted a 
 
         "widening gap between the U.S. and Europe" on 
 
         the basic salience and perimeters of global

         terrorism.

			<p>My question to you is this, here we

         are six months later, how are our requests for 
 
         international cooperation in the area of 
 
         financing of terrorism being met?  How are 
          other key participants in the international 
 
         community currently responding to our request

         for help?

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  I think with respect to 
 
         both questions, unfortunately they are better

         posed to someone who is currently working on 
 
         these issues on behalf of the United States

         Government, but I do think that, as a general 
 
         matter, there is substantial evidence to 
 
         suggest that our foreign partners    you have

         to remember, the way this process has worked 
 
         insofar as IEEPA designations is concerned, is

         that the United States, through executive 
 
         order, has named individuals and organizations 
 
         that are part of the terrorist financial

         network,  the assets of which are frozen, 
 
         assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

         U.S. persons are prohibited by law from 
 
         transacting business with those persons or 
 
         organizations. 
			<p> That process has been 
 
         multi lateralized through U.N. Security Council

         Resolution 1390 whereby the same names of 
 
         individuals or organizations has gone to the 
 
         United Nations and gone out to the member

         states of United Nations for similar action, as 
 
         the member states may wish to engage in.

			<p>There have been, in my experience, two 
 
         problems with the multi lateralization of that 
 
         process.  The first is that many states lack

         the technical capacity to actually freeze 
 
         funds.  That was illustrated for me personally

         when I visited, in recent months, a 
 
         strategically significant African country and I 
 
         asked them the question:  What happened to this

         piece of paper with all these names that came 
 
         from the United Nations?  Where did it go?

         Answer: It went to the Foreign Ministry.

			<p>I go to the Foreign Ministry and say, 
 
         what did you do with this piece of paper with 
          all the names on it?  Well, we sent it to the 
 
         Central Bank.

			<p>Go to the Central Bank, as I did and 
 
         say, what happened to this list?  Well, we sent 
 
         it to our banks.

			<p>Go to the banks, as I did:  What 
 
         happened to this piece of paper with all the

         names?  Well, we put it over there because we 
 
         don't have any ability to go through our 
 
         accounts and identify the beneficial holders of

         the accounts.

			<p>So that is a point on technical

         capacity which needs to be addressed in this 
 
         context.

			<p>The second point has to do with

         differing standards of who and what constitutes 
 
         a terrorist, and also the evidentiary standards

         with respect to the type of information that 
 
         foreign states have asked for in connection 
 
         with supporting the U.S. designations. 
			<p> With respect to the first subpoint, as 
 
         the report of the Council on Foreign Relations

         notes, the European Union still to this day 
 
         permits Hamas and Hizbollah to legally raise 
 
         funds on its territory.

			<p>Secondly, with respect to evidentiary 
 
         standards, what we have found post 9/11 was

         that while there was initial willingness of 
 
         other states to freeze funds over designated 
 
         individuals and organizations originated by the

         U.S.  Government, that willingness faded as the 
 
         months went on and foreign states asked for

         increasingly sensitive intelligence information 
 
         that supported the original U.S. designations, 
 
         which when it wasn't provided caused them to

         fail to take steps to freeze the accounts of 
 
         designated individuals and organizations.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  Mr Wolosky, would you 
 
         give us a brief description of how the Hawala 
 
         system works.  What kind of financial system is 
          it?

			<p>And secondly, what the United States

         has done with respect to its illegitimate use 
 
         for the support of terrorism when the deposits 
 
         originate here in the United States.

			<p>And third, whether there is really 
 
         anything we can do with respect to such an

         informal system when the transactions take
 
         place entirely overseas.

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Sure.  The way it works

         is essentially as follows.

			<p>Let's assume that I am a Pakistani

         immigrant living in Brooklyn and wish to 
 
         transfer $500 to my parents living in 
 
         Islamabad.  The way I can use the Hawala system

         to accomplish that money transfer is by going 
 
         to a local individual, a hawaladar in Brooklyn,

         giving him my $500.  He uses his network, which 
 
         is most frequently a clan or family based 
 
         network and contacts his counterpart in 
          Islamabad, and he says, when someone comes in 
 
         with a particular identifying code, give him

         the $500.

			<p>That system enables money to be moved 
 
         without the physical movement of money   

			<p>MR. GORTON:  Is not that individual in 
 
         Brooklyn engaged in banking activities under

         the laws of New York?

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Well, until recently the 
 
         problem has been that there has been no Federal

         regulation of that activity.  Post 9/11, using 
 
         preexisting legal authorities, the Department

         of the Treasury has begun to require that 
 
         activity, individuals who engage in that 
 
         activity to register.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  I see.

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Because the activity

         fundamentally is intended to be anonymous, 
 
         without record keeping, without paper trails. 
 
         The likelihood that the individuals will 
          register is quite remote.

			<p>But notwithstanding that fact, it

         provides a basis for prosecution in Federal 
 
         court if they fail to register.  Prior to 9/11 
 
         frequently there was no basis for prosecution

         in Federal court.  Now if they fail to 
 
         register, they can be prosecuted.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  Is that effectively our 
 
         method of stopping some portion of that $500 
 
         from going, not to the parent in Islamabad, but

         to terrorism?

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Yes.  I think a basic

         point which you alluded to is that this system 
 
         of moving money is used for mainly legitimate 
 
         purposes.  It is unique to several different

         cultures in south Asia and east Asia.  It has 
 
         been used for centuries. It is used by

         terrorists and other criminals, but it is also 
 
         used by a lot of people who just want to move 
 
         money and avoid formal banking.  They have 
          access to formal financial systems, but they 
 
         want to avoid it, for whatever reasons.

			<p>But you asked whether that was the 
 
         primary method of regulating this activity in 
 
         the United States.  I believe that it is,

         through a registration system.

			<p>And you also asked whether it    what

         steps or whether the United States should take 
 
         action to prevent other countries from being 
 
         part of abuses of this system.

			<p>I think the answer is yes.  Again, if 
 
         you look under Title 3 of the U.S.A. Patriot

         Act, it authorizes the Executive Branch to 
 
         restrict or prohibit access to the U.S. financial 
 
         system on the part of states or foreign

         financial institutions that lack adequate 
 
         anti money laundering regimes.

			<p>This is ultimately the most powerful 
 
         tool in the arsenal of the U.S.  Government. 
 
         It has not    and it provides leverage over 
          states that, for instance, refuse to regulate 
 
         in any manner the Hawala system.

			<p>It hasn't really been used to this 
 
         point in this context and the findings of the 
 
         distinguished Bipartisan Commission and the

         Council on Foreign Relations was that it 
 
         should.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  One follow up question. 
 
         You may have left out the middle of this 
 
         transaction.  Your Pakistani has gone and given

         $500 to the Hawala person in Brooklyn who has then 
 
         called Islamabad or communicated with

         Islamabad, which gives $500 to the parent 
 
         there, but somehow or other the $500 has still 
 
         got to get from Brooklyn to Islamabad, does it

         not?

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  No.  It doesn't.  That's

         how the system works.

			<p>In other words, it is credited through 
 
         family relationship, let's say, or a clan based 
          relationship.  The money itself physically does 
 
         not move.

			<p>If you, for instance, if your uncle 
 
         called you and asked you to loan some $500 to 
 
         someone who he wanted you to loan the money to,

         you probably would do it, even if he didn't 
 
         advance you the $500.  You would rely on the

         fact of your family relationship for settlement 
 
         to occur in the manner of your choosing, at 
 
         some future day.  That is exactly how the

         Hawala system works.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  There would be an

         off setting transaction at some point in the 
 
         future?

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  At some point in the

         future.  Again, at a time of convenience, 
 
         whatever the circumstances may require.  It

         doesn't have to be in cash.  It could be in 
 
         gold or it could be through some co mingled 
 
         account in an Islamic bank.  It can occur in a 
          variety of different ways.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  One of the challenges

         for this Commission is to look at 
 
         organizational issues and to make sure, A, our 
 
         Government is arrayed correctly and organized

         correctly and, B, that it is using all of its 
 
         authorities.

			<p>The Council on Foreign Relations 
 
         report and your testimony note, a lack of 
 
         organizational accountability for the money

         laundering issue.  You made a number of 
 
         recommendations with regard to who should have

         the leadership and who should have the ultimate 
 
         responsibility.

			<p>Since that report was issued, can you

         describe what, if anything, has been done to 
 
         address the organizational problems that you

         identified, and could you describe briefly 
 
         those organizational deficiencies?

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Sure.  The report 
          suggested that notwithstanding the significance 
 
         of this issue, the fundamental significance of

         this issue, there was no single U.S. official 
 
         with the correct mandate and authority to 
 
         coordinate U.S. policy on terrorist financing

         issues.  Policy is currently coordinated 
 
         through a policy coordination committee that is

         headed by the General Council of the Treasury 
 
         Department.

			<p>The Bipartisan Commission of the

         Council on Foreign Relations concluded that 
 
         that, for a variety of reasons, was not the

         most effective way to coordinate various 
 
         diplomatic, intelligence and law enforcement 
 
         and regulatory ingredients that contribute to

         effective and sustained U.S. policy response.

			<p>For one thing, the report of the

         Council on Foreign Relations concluded that the 
 
         Treasury Department was not the appropriate 
 
         agency to coordinate diplomatic or intelligence 
          activities.

			<p>There is also the question as to

         whether or not even the most capable General 
 
         Counsel of the Treasury    and I don't know the 
 
         General Counsel of the Treasury, but I am told

         that he is extraordinarily competent    given 
 
         his other statutory and institution responsibilities,

         has other things to worry about than the 
 
         suppression of terrorist financing.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  I take it from your

         report, though, that the Congress has vested 
 
         this responsibility in the Treasury Department

         and other agencies of Government have resisted 
 
         implementing that; is that correct?

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  I think that the

         Executive Bank has vested this responsibility 
 
         in the Treasury Department.  There is no

         statutory authority whatsoever with respect to 
 
         terrorist financing.

			<p>Our report concluded that because of 
          the very different and difficult ingredients 
 
         that contribute to an effective response,

         ranging from diplomatic activities to 
 
         intelligence activities to regulatory 
 
         activities, that that was best coordinated out

         of the White House.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  An organizational

         question for you, Mr. Fine.

			<p>You have noted that a very substantial 
 
         portion of the immigration and naturalization

         service responsibilities that are the subject 
 
         of your reports, have now been transferred to

         the Department of Homeland Security.

			<p>Your office has evidently built up a 
 
         tremendous amount of expertise in the review

         and oversight of those functions.  Has all of 
 
         that capacity in your office been transferred

         to the Department of Homeland Security so that 
 
         that oversight can continue uninterrupted in 
 
         that new department? 
			<p> MR. FINE:  All of our capacity has not 
 
         been transferred, but we have transferred a

         portion of our capacity.

			<p>There is a Department of Homeland 
 
         Security, Office of the Inspector General that

         has been created.  It has been created with 
 
         resources from various entities.  We have

         provided resources to it.  The Department of 
 
         Treasury Inspector General's Office has 
 
         provided resources to it.  The Department of

         Transportation Inspector General's Office has 
 
         provided resources, FEMA and others.  So there

         is a newly developed Department of Homeland Security, 
 
         OIG.  We have provided investigators and some 
 
         managers to that entity.

			<p>A lot of our capacity is involved with 
 
         the INS, but it is also involved with the FBI,

         the DEA, the Marshal Service.  So there is not a 
 
         distinct unit that we could transfer over 
 
         there. 
			<p> I do think it is a critical issue that 
 
         you raised, though, because I do think that is

         it is critically important that there be 
 
         adequate, aggressive and strong oversight over 
 
         this new entity, ranging from the INS to the

         Customs Service, to the Secret Service to the 
 
         TSA.  It is going to be a daunting challenge

         for that new agency, the Department of Homeland 
 
         Security OIG, to get up and running, and to 
 
         ensure that there is continuity of oversight.

			<p>We believe strongly in it and we think 
 
         that that new OIG ought to be adequately funded

         to perform its mission in an aggressive way.

			<p>MR. HAMILTON:  Mr. Wolosky,    well, 
 
         first of all let me say, this has been a

         marvelous panel.  Each of the three of you 
 
         have been very helpful to the Commission and we

         appreciate it.

			<p>Mr. Wolosky, I was focused on your 
 
         final paragraph.  "We don't hold the Saudis 
          feet to the fire."

			<p>I gather from your testimony that we,

         the United States, and the countries that are 
 
         most responsible here, if we had the political 
 
         will to crack down on financing, we could do

         it.  But, because of policy considerations that 
 
         are very important, we don't do it.

			<p>We have to have the oil.  We have to 
 
         have the overflight rights.  We have to have 
 
         the basing rights.  And because we have to have

         those things, we do not hold their feet to the 
 
         fire.  Is that your view?

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  That is my view. 
 
         Unfortunately, I wasn't called before you to 
 
         testify on policy with regard to Saudi Arabia

         in the current context of   

			<p>MR. HAMILTON:  I know, I appreciate

         that.  I am not being critical of you in any 
 
         way.  It is just a very good illustration of 
 
         how policy gets in the way of, in this case, 
          enforcement.

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Yes.  That's the point

         of my testimony.  In other words, I am not here 
 
         to make judgments of whether or not particular 
 
         issues should be prioritized over other issues,

         but what I can tell you is that the United 
 
         States, at the highest levels, has not spoken

         out loudly and forcefully on the terrorist 
 
         financing issue as it relates to Saudi Arabia.

			<p>That is not to say that things aren't being

         done.  I have every reason to believe that a 
 
         lot is being done, but it is being done in the

         shadows.  The conclusion of the Council of 
 
         Foreign Relations' report was that it was time 
 
         to bring it out of the shadows.  For the

         President of the United States or for other 
 
         senior officials to state clearly,

         unequivocally and unambiguously what was 
 
         required of the Saudi Government on the 
 
         terrorist financing issue. 
			<p> That is not being done, and in the 
 
         judgment of this task force it needed to be

         done in order to set benchmarks for the Saudis 
 
         and to enable the Saudi Government to 
 
         communicate to its own citizens what kind of

         conduct was and was not acceptable.

			<p>MR. THOMPSON:  Mr. Dillingham, I don't

         want to sound like a cranky business traveller, 
 
         but I would like to get into an area of focus 
 
         on the part of TSA in terms of air travel

         security, because funding follows focus, as we 
 
         know, and your testimony and that of Mr. Fine

         this morning, have pointed out some rather 
 
         large funding gaps, particularly with regard to 
 
         port security which you testified to, and the

         issue of water security that Mr. Fine testified 
 
         to.

			<p>I acknowledge that TSA employees, the 
 
         new ones especially, are finding and retrieving 
 
         large amounts of weapons.  But if news stories 
          are to be credited, some weapons still get 
 
         through.  I understand it is a system which

         depends not just on technology, but on human 
 
         instinct and humans paying attention as well. 
 
         But it seems to me that a fault of government

         is it fights yesterday's battles.

			<p>As I go through airline security

         screening processes, I see this sort of almost 
 
         obsessive focus on belts, and shoes.  And at 
 
         the same time you are telling me that

         containers are coming into the United States 
 
         inspected only at the level of 2 percent, if

         that.  And Mr. Fine is telling me that the 
 
         northern border is, in many respects, an 
 
         unprotected area, particularly with regard to

         24/7 coverage.  While everybody is down in the 
 
         Southwest trying to prevent undocumented

         workers from crossing the border to work in the 
 
         United States and take jobs that Americans 
 
         won't do. 
			<p> Is our focus on airline security 
 
         wrong?  Who makes these policies?  Who reviews

         these policies?  How are they kept up to date? 
 
         Are we anticipating ways in which terrorists 
 
         can use airline vulnerability, or are we saying

         that because Richard Reid got on an airplane 
 
         and tried to light his shoes, that we are going

         to focus on shoes of millions and millions of 
 
         American business travellers.  And for the life 
 
         of me, maybe you can explain it, but I don't

         see the relevance of showing your belt buckle 
 
         open as opposed to your belt buckle closed, and

         yet we have these jam ups at the security 
 
         system screening depots with people milling 
 
         around.  We have all seen this process.

			<p>Is this the right balance?  Is there 
 
         somebody sitting in Washington to say, well,

         let's look at what we are doing about airline 
 
         security and try and anticipate future attacks?

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Yes, Governor, if I 
          could.

			<p>I think it is part of, if you have

         only got a hammer, all of the answers you use 
 
         that hammer for.  That's sort of how aviation 
 
         security has evolved.  That was the first thing

         that came out of the box and we have applied 
 
         all of our resources to it.

			<p>It may seem    if I can give you just 
 
         sort of a story behind the belt buckle.  What 
 
         has been determined is that before 9/11 people

         would    the belt buckle would send off an 
 
         alarm and the screener would pass by and say,

         okay, belt buckle, no problem.

			<p>But the process of testing the system, 
 
         if you have a belt buckle and you can hide a

         weapon inside or behind that belt buckle, and 
 
         it is only passed as, it is only a buckle, it

         is not a weapon.  That's the kind of situation 
 
         that they were focusing on.

			<p>It is the same thing with people at 
          airports.  They see grandmothers and children 
 
         being examined and it seems embarrassing, in

         fact it can be, but they also have intelligence 
 
         to say that the terrorists have used these kind 
 
         of ways to get things through.

			<p>We are now seeing a ratcheting back of 
 
         the things that don't make sense.  We are

         seeing a rationalization of security.  You are 
 
         no longer asked did you pack your bag, has it 
 
         been with you the whole time.  There is no

         longer the prohibition of driving up to the 
 
         airport.

			<p>We are seeing ratcheting back.  We are 
 
         seeing a rationalization of it.  So there is 
 
         someone who is looking at this.  After 9/11 it

         was, let's do everything that we can to change 
 
         the situation for aviation security, and now

         there are changes.

			<p>You are right, that has been the 
 
         reputation of security in this country, 
          fighting the last battle and not looking for 
 
         what's coming.  I can tell you that our office

         is looking at that issue and trying to 
 
         understand, you know, to what extent are we 
 
         looking for the next generation of technology.

         To what extent are we moving beyond where we 
 
         were being prepared for the threats that we

         haven't seen yet, but we know were out there.

			<p>MR. THOMPSON:  Mr. Fine, going back to 
 
         the students for the moment.  Do we have a

         rough idea how many students are in the United 
 
         States at any one particular time?

			<p>MR. FINE:  About half a million.

			<p>MR. THOMPSON:  Have a million?

			<p>MR. FINE:  Yes.

			<p>MR. THOMPSON:  I noticed all the way 
 
         through you written testimony, and a little bit

         in your oral testimony as well, that almost 
 
         every system that we have developed or 
 
         identified to deal with some of the issues 
          about student entry or student remainder or 
 
         student registration, don't yet seem to be

         working or up to snuff.  I mean, is the shear 
 
         number of foreign students in the United States 
 
         at any one time going to overwhelm any system?

			<p>MR. FINE:  It clearly overwhelmed the 
 
         paper based system which was antiquated and

         inefficient.  A computer based system I am not 
 
         sure will overwhelm the ability of the system 
 
         to track who is in the country, who is not in

         the country, who has shown up at school, who 
 
         had has gotten a student visa, came to the

         United States and then never showed up in the 
 
         school, as actually one of the September 11 
 
         hijackers did.  He got a visa to show up at a

         language school, never showed up.  The school 
 
         didn't do anything about it and none of the

         authorities knew this.

			<p>So we need a system that tracks that 
 
         and can provide that information.  What is 
          going to be very difficult is what to do with 
 
         that information and how to decide what is the

         important ones to follow through with and how 
 
         to prioritize what happens with an enormous 
 
         amount of information.  For that, I think,

         there needs to be intelligence and adequate 
 
         intelligence to determine where the threats are.

			<p>But in the first step there does have 
 
         to be a system, a computerized system that does 
 
         track the status of the students.  I believe

         that the SEVIS system that is being implemented 
 
         is a good system and has the potential to do

         it, it is just simply not fully implemented and 
 
         needs more steps to go.

			<p>MR. THOMPSON:  Assuming the systems

         work, can we ever hire enough people to 
 
         follow up on the information in the system and

         go track the people down who disappear from the 
 
         system?  To me that is a really devilish 
 
         problem. 
			<p> MR. FINE:  I don't think you can hire 
 
         enough people to track all of them, but I think

         you can do some efforts with some issues where 
 
         there is intelligence that indicates you need to.

			<p>It is also important to be able to

         provide information from that system to other 
 
         law enforcement agencies, so that when other

         law enforcement agencies come in contact with 
 
         somebody, they will know that this is a person 
 
         out of status, this is a student who never

         showed up at school.  So they have that 
 
         information and can act upon it.  Prior to this

         computerized system, there was no possibility 
 
         of that.

			<p>MR. THOMPSON:  Could you or Mr.

         Dillingham comment on the status of the 
 
         technology or efforts, pilot programs, or

         anything else that is out there to prescreen 
 
         business travellers on airlines, or prescreen 
 
         workers who come into the United States during 
          the course of day and go back to their host 
 
         country in the evening.

			<p>It seems to me we haven't made much 
 
         progress there and the result is, I presume, 
 
         that we are still using a lot of human

         resources to screen the same people 
 
         day in day out that present what you presume to

         be a low security risk.  Are there enough 
 
         people to guard our northern border?

			<p>MR. FINE:  Those are important

         projects.  There are some projects that provide 
 
         trusted travellers access across the border.

         They are not universally available.  I believe 
 
         that is an issue that needs to be addressed and 
 
         needs to be more widely used.

			<p>Part of the issue is the money. 
 
         Sometimes the fees are higher than people want

         to pay.  But it is a program that I think 
 
         provides some relief from the crushing workload 
 
         that inspectors have along the border, an 
          ability to speed some people up and allow 
 
         greater scrutiny of others.

			<p>MR. THOMPSON:  The technology is there, 
 
         I presume?

			<p>MR. FINE:  Yes.

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Yes.  Following what 
 
         Mr. Fine said, the TSA is in fact looking at

         programs such as trusted travellers, starting 
 
         with identifying, using identification with 
 
         biometrics for all transportation workers.  So

         that is in process.

			<p>And at an international level, I think

         it is one of the unresolved issues.  There is 
 
         some cooperation between other countries and 
 
         the United States in terms of supplying

         passenger lists for international travellers 
 
         ahead of time.  That is one of the issues that

         needs to be further explored.  Bilateral, 
 
         multilateral agreements with regard to security 
 
         and security operations between the United 
          States and other countries.  It is clearly an 
 
         open area.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  I have one question and 
 
         then Commissioner Ben Veniste and Commissioner 
 
         Lehman.

			<p>I think I read about a year ago for the first time that 
 
         the greatest danger out there was probably

         containers, and containers in container ports. 
 
         You said practically the same thing again today 
 
         and I read it a number of times in between.

         You said, well the technology has got to be 
 
         developed.

			<p>Can you give us any kind of 
 
         approximate timetable when that kind of danger 
 
         is going to be lessened or are we just going to

         live with it?

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  We are certainly

         going to live with it for a while.  There are 
 
         some technologies out there that can be used. 
 
         What's missing right now is better technology 
          and also the balance between screening and 
 
         moving cargo.  There are ways in which you can

         x ray these containers, you can physically 
 
         inspect these containers, but what you are 
 
         talking about is slowing the commercial

         process.  That is where the balance has to be 
 
         struck.

			<p>Technologies are, in fact, being 
 
         developed.  In some cases the technology is so 
 
         expensive at this point that it is also not

         being readily accepted by the maritime 
 
         community.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Is there any kind of a 
 
         timetable, six months a year, two years?

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  I would go with

         multiple years.  Not six months, not a year, 
 
         but a few years.

			<p>MR. THOMPSON:  What do other countries 
 
         do?

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  They are petty much 
          in the same way.  Those are the containers that 
 
         are coming here.  What we have now is we are

         trying to work with other countries to do some 
 
         screening, some random screening of containers 
 
         at their point of origin so there is less to be

         concerned about as they arrive on U.S.  shores, 
 
         but it is an international issue.  It is an

         international issue, so they aren't doing any more 
 
         than we are doing.

			<p>You will find, for example, in an

         aviation context, El Al does a lot more with 
 
         containers that are going on board and cargo

         that is going on board than the U.S. does.  But 
 
         the thing about that is, it is such a small 
 
         operation compared to what we do in the States

         that it is not even comparable almost.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Commissioner Ben Veniste.

			<p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  Thank you.  Mr. 
 
         Fine, I want to express our appreciation for 
 
         your offer of complete cooperation with this 
          Commission.  We will definitely take you up on 
 
         it.

			<p>In the limited time we have available, 
 
         it is imperative that we take advantage of the 
 
         pre existing work that has been done in order

         to identify what needs to be done further and 
 
         to make recommendations to the Congress and the

         President.

			<p>I want to mention, yesterday Mr. 
 
         Wolosky, we had a panel that included Professor

         Ranstorp and Brian Jenkins who spoke about the 
 
         galvanizing effect of 9/11 on the cooperation

         of international intelligence agencies with our 
 
         own in connection with the anti terrorism 
 
         efforts.

			<p>You have made a very provocative 
 
         statement with respect to the potential for

         degrading that cooperative effort as the result 
 
         of political differences relating to the war in 
 
         Iraq.  Do you have any concrete evidence or 
          information to suggest that the multilateral 
 
         intelligence services have in any way slacked

         off from their cooperation with our 
 
         intelligence community in that respect?

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  No, I don't.  But I can

         tell you that having worked these issues 
 
         day in day out, they are very difficult under

         the best of circumstances.  What I fear is that 
 
         we may be entering into the worst of 
 
         circumstances with respect to our efforts to

         cooperate with states that disagree with U.S. 
 
         policies in Iraq, which I happen to support.

			<p>But my point is that it may be 
 
         increasingly difficult for moderate Arab 
 
         regimes, and even our traditional allies, to

         continue to engage in the type of cooperation 
 
         that, I agree, was unprecedented following

         September 11.

			<p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  So your observation 
 
         is one based on informed speculation rather 
          than actual evidence?

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Correct.

			<p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  Let me ask just one 
 
         other question of Mr. Fine and Mr. Dillingham. 
 
         We have heard about the potential for the

         trusted traveller card, perhaps utilizing 
 
         biometric information.

			<p>Is this the precursor, is this the 
 
         camel's nose under the tent for a national 
 
         identity card utilizing such information?

			<p>MR. FINE:  I don't believe it is the 
 
         camel under the tent.  It is an option for

         people to undertake if they want to go quickly 
 
         across the border.  It is a voluntary thing 
 
         that people can participate in or not

         participate in if they want to.

			<p>I think there are clear benefits to

         it, to them and to the system to allow certain 
 
         people who have been prescreened to go across 
 
         the border quickly. 
			<p> MR. DILLINGHAM:  I would agree.  I 
 
         wouldn't say that it is the nose under the

         tent, but I would want to point out that as far 
 
         an as transportation is concerned, this does 
 
         not mean that passengers or persons would not

         be subject to screening.  They would still go 
 
         through a screening process.  It means that

         they would not necessarily have that second 
 
         screening at the gate.  Again, I agree that it 
 
         is a voluntary process.

			<p>Right now transportation is developing 
 
         what's called a Computer Assisted Passenger

         Profiling System, CAPS, which is based on 
 
         information about the passenger that allows 
 
         them to be sort of placed in the various

         categories of screening.  Almost like our 
 
         national terrorist alert sort of thing, red,

         green, yellow in terms of degree of screening. 
 
         At the end of that flight, that information is 
 
         purged and not kept.  There is clearly civil 
          liberties and privacy issues and organizations 
 
         looking at that.

			<p>We think that it is a way to make our 
 
         system more efficient and focus our resources 
 
         on those places where they need to be focused,

         finite resources for security.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Okay we have to move on

         with Commissioner Lehman, Commissioner Fielding 
 
         and Commissioner Roemer who have suggested that 
 
         they would like to ask brief questions, I hope.

			<p>MR. LEHMAN:  I have two brief 
 
         questions for Mr. Dillingham.

			<p>First, while little old ladies are 
 
         being frisked at La Guardia, it is possible for 
 
         an Arab businessman to pick up the phone and

         make a call an go up to Whiteplains and charter 
 
         a Gulfstream or 737 Boeing executive jet which

         have no reinforced doors, no armed pilots and 
 
         no screening for him and his party to go 
 
         through. 
			<p> Are there any plans to do anything 
 
         about this rather huge lacuna in our civil

         aviation security?

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Yes, Mr. Secretary. 
 
         We have pointed out that charter flights,

         general aviation, cargo, these are still 
 
         significant gaps in security and they, in fact,

         have to be addressed.  It is a matter of 
 
         priorities and funding.

			<p>Almost any aircraft can be a weapon.

         I mean, we saw in the Florida case where just a 
 
         general aviation aircraft was stolen and flown

         into a building.  That could have very well 
 
         been an aircraft that had some chemical 
 
         biological agents on it as well.

			<p>The point is, the threats and the 
 
         vulnerabilities are everywhere.

			<p>MR. LEHMAN:  Yes, but this one is so 
 
         obvious, what is taking so long?  Here we are a 
 
         long time after 9/11 and nothing has been done, 
 
         I can assure you, because I use these planes 
 
         fairly frequently and I have never seen a touch

         of security.

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  It is recognized.  We 
 
         keep pointing it out, but we can't make them do

         it.  Hopefully the Commission will point this 
 
         out, as well, as one of the gaps and that is a

         gap that needs to be addressed.

			<p>MR. LEHMAN:  I would say it is a 
 
         fairly urgent and glaring one considering the

         urgency that has been applied to some other 
 
         sectors.  Anyway, enough said.

			<p>The other question I have, as a 
 
         veteran of the Reagan Administration, I 
 
         participated in a major crisis effort to

         increase airline security after several 
 
         hijackings in the early days of the Reagan

         Administration.  I recall that a U.S. marshal 
 
         program was put into effect at that time with 
 
         great urgency.  I also recall that there was an 
 
         edict put out, to put reinforced doors and to 
 
         see that the pilots    that the door were kept

         closed throughout the flight and that only the 
 
         pilot had the key.

			<p>What ever happened to those programs?

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Unfortunately, the 
 
         history has been when the particular event

         leaves the headlines, the follow through has 
 
         not always been what we would want it to be, 
 
         and that's the case with many of the

         recommendations that took place after Pan Am 103, 
 
         after the TWA 800.  We have 9/11 and we have a

         situation where the Federal Air Marshal Service 
 
         went from less than thirty or less than a hundred, to several thousand within a 
 
         short period of time.  We have a situation

         where the recommendation that you made early on 
 
         about cockpit doors being locked and so forth,

         that now some 10, 15 years later we now have, 
 
         as a result of 9/11, we have 80 percent of the 
 
         fleet with doors installed and the deadline 
 
         being at the end of the week for all of the 
 
         fleet.

			<p>It's the nature of where we have been, 
 
         as long as there is oversight and constant 
 
         reinforcement that these things must be done,

         the more likely that they will, in fact, be 
 
         done.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Commissioner Fielding.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  Thank you.  I have two 
 
         quick questions to you, Mr. Dillingham.

			<p>First of all, I guess as a cranky 
 
         flyer I ought to tell you that I think the TSA

         people are a vast improvement and are obviously 
 
         trained in attitude as well, and I applaud you 
 
         for that.

			<p>You gave us the list of priorities, of 
 
         vulnerability priorities, and I understand air

         and then maritime, but for our planning 
 
         purposes could you go a little further down the 
 
         list? 
 
			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  I think the next one 
 
         on the list would be mass transit, freight rail

         would follow that.  The reason I say mass 
 
         transit is because so many persons use mass 
 
         transit and an incident on mass transit would

         have not only disastrous human effect, but the 
 
         psychology of that would also be tremendous.

			<p>Rail, it's hard to prioritize too much 
 
         because a chemical biological accident 
 
         associated with rail has both the human

         dimension as well as the psychological 
 
         dimension.  So it is in that order I would go,

         aviation, maritime mass transit, rail.

			<p>Now, having said that, more people 
 
         ride the bus than many of these modes combined,

         but it is the incident.  I mean, the likelihood 
 
         of you going to do damage to enough buses at

         one point in time as opposed to what would 
 
         happen in mass transit, as we saw in the Japan 
 
         incident, it is different.  So it's the 
 
         greatest harm to the greatest number of people 
 
         is part of the decision about where things

         rank.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  Thank you, the other 
 
         thing is just to follow up on what Secretary

         Lehman asked you.

			<p>Your answer to light aircraft issue,

         which has boggled everybody's mind who has ever 
 
         been around those, is "you can't make them do 
 
         it."  Who is "them"?

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Well, you can make 
 
         recommendations and usually our recommendations

         will go to the U.S.  Congress.  We make 
 
         recommendations to the agencies who in turn are 
 
         responsive to the U.S. Congress.  So it has to

         be a congressional priority that is followed 
 
         through, and often times    I think someone

         mentioned today, that action goes 
 
         where the money goes.

			<p>It is not for us to sort of make 
 
         policies.  It is for us to present the 
 
         information to the policy makers, and from

         there, they can make them do it.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  How about the Executive 
 
         Branch?

			<p>MR. DILLINGHAM:  Those are the people 
 
         that we generally are saying need to do

         something.  We are a congressional agency and 
 
         our mission is oversight, generally, of the 
 
         executive agencies.

			<p>I don't want to sound like they don't 
 
         do anything, but generally the implementation

         is not the way we want it to be.  Some of the 
 
         recommendations that have been made about 
 
         aviation have been around for years.  They were

         either not implemented or partially 
 
         implemented.

			<p>After 9/11 there was a new urgency to 
 
         it.  We have been talking about screeners not 
 
         doing what they are supposed to do for 15 
 
         years.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr.

         Chairman.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Last question for 
 
         Commissioner Roemer.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
 
         I too want to join in applauding the help that

         this particular panel has been to the 
 
         Commission.

			<p>I want to ask Mr. Fine, having been on

         the Education Committee for 12 years in 
 
         Congress and having sat through many oversight

         hearings of SEVIS and heard time and time and 
 
         time again that we couldn't implement the 
 
         program, it would be another year, it would be

         another year.  We are experiencing this program 
 
         problem and that problem.

			<p>When is this finally going to be ready 
 
         to be fully implemented and working in our 
 
         country? 
 
			<p>MR. FINE:  Well, it has been 
 
         implemented.  There is the SEVIS system

         available.  It applies to new students now. 
 
         There are clearly bugs in it, there are clearly 
 
         problems with it, but I believe the INS has

         made significant progress in implementing the 
 
         system.

			<p>We have pointed out where deficiencies 
 
         are.  They need to address those deficiencies. 
 
         Come August, they say that it will apply to

         every student, not solely the new students but 
 
         also the continuing students.  So according to

         their schedule, by August of this year the 
 
         SEVIS system will be up, running, available and 
 
         we hope will be adequately followed through

         with all the things that need to be done to 
 
         ensure that is fully implemented as well.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  You have confidence that 
 
         that deadline is going to be reached?

			<p>MR. FINE:  I wouldn't say with 
 
         confidence that it is going to be reached, 
 
         because I have seen similar things that you have

         seen.  What I will say is, they have made 
 
         progress and they need to make more progress.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  Mr. Wolosky, one quick

         question for you.

			<p>With respect to Saudi Arabia and the

         efforts they are making internally and 
 
         bilaterally with the United States to do more 
 
         about cracking down on the financing of

         contributions to terrorist operations, how 
 
         would you measure the lack of progress since

         9/11 internally?  What have they done 
 
         internally to crack down? And secondly, externally and

         bilaterally with the United States?  In 
 
         addition to elevating this to the highest

         levels of concern for us, what other steps need 
 
         to be taken to make this communication more of 
 
         a priority in terms of benchmarks and 
 
         implementing programs?

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  Sure.  Well, in

         assessing what has been done I think it is 
 
         helpful to distinguish, again, between tactical 
 
         measures and strategic measures.

			<p>The tactical measures are, again, ones 
 
         that target particular nodes of the terrorist

         financing infrastructure, particular 
 
         individuals, particular charities, et cetera.

			<p>Much of that activity is conducted by

         law enforcement intelligence agencies.  Much of 
 
         it is not transparent and should remain not

         transparent.

			<p>There has been a substantial amount of 
 
         activity, as I understand it, between the

         United States Government and the Saudi 
 
         Government at the tactical law enforcement and

         intelligence level.

			<p>At the same time, there have been 
 
         indications that there are problems, chiefly, 
 
         with respect to the two public designations 
 
         that were made of organizations or individuals

         that support terror.  Jointly, I mean joint 
 
         designations under the IEEPA statute with the 
 
         Saudi Government, there were two last year.

         One targeted the Al Aman charity and the 
 
         other was targeting an individual who was

         identified by the Treasury Department as a 
 
         significant contributor-one of the cofounders 
 
         of al Qaeda is what I believe the Treasury

         press release said.

			<p>Now, with respect to Al Aman the

         problems are published reports that it is still 
 
         in business with respect to the individual who 
 
         is identified in September and designated by

         U.S.  Government.  The problem is that in the 
 
         days after his designation by the U.S.

         Government, the designation was questioned by 
 
         senior Saudi officials.

			<p>So that indicates to me, at least, 
 
         that notwithstanding substantial efforts, there 
 
         are still problems at the tactical level in

         identifying particular nodes within terrorist 
 
         financial system with Saudi Arabia.

			<p>Now, at the strategic level, there you

         get into questions of regulation of charities, 
 
         steps that are taken or avoided with respect to

         putting in place, know your customer rules and 
 
         suspicious activity reporting requirements 
 
         within Saudi financial institutions.

         Regulations of charities, like hawala, things 
 
         of that sort.

			<p>Again, that information should be 
 
         publicly available.  It should be available to 
 
         this Commission.  It should be available to the

         United States Government.  It should be 
 
         available to me as a concerned private citizen

         when I log onto the web.  At least with respect 
 
         to my efforts, I haven't been able to find it.

			<p>MR. ROEMER: Thank you. 
 
			<p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you very much.  This 
 
         has been a very, very helpful panel.  I hope we

         can come back to some of you again.  Thank you very 
 
         much for your help.

			<p>(Recess.)

			<p>MR. KEAN:  The next panel consists of 
 
         Michael Wermuth of RAND Corporation, Steven

         Brill, author of a book many of us have read, 
 
         &quot;After: How America Confronted the September 12 
 
         Era.&quot;  Zoe Baird of the Markle Foundation, and

         Randy Larsen of ANSER Institute for Homeland 
 
         Security.

			<p>And I know, Mr. Brill, you have a hard 
 
         and fast deadline, so maybe if with start off 
 
         with you, sir.

			<p>MR. BRILL:  Thank you very much, 
 
         Governor.  I appreciate your accommodating me.

			<p>I am delighted to be here this morning 
 
         and honored to be asked to share some of my 
 
         views with you.  I think the primary benefit 
 
         that I might be able to offer the Committee, 
 
         which is something less than the expertise of

         the witnesses you have just heard, is that for 
 
         the last year and a half I travelled this 
 
         country, trying to get a grip on all of the

         questions you have been dealing with and, in 
 
         particular, the questions you were dealing with

         this morning.

			<p>I spoke at great length not only to 
 
         the people at the top of the issues, Attorney

         General Ashcroft, Secretary Ridge, Bob Bonnard, 
 
         Jim Loy and people like that, and their staffs,

         but also to the people who are actually out in 
 
         the field trying to implement and make sense of 
 
         what was going on in Washington during some

         very difficult times.

			<p>My goal was to make a connection

         between policy, between discussions like the 
 
         ones we are having today and what was actually 
 
         happening in the airports, at the docks, at the 
 
         borders.

			<p>What I found, I think I can keep my

         remarks fairly brief and I hope quite simple, 
 
         really falls much more under the category of 
 
         what we can go do going forward as opposed to

         mistakes we might have made in the past.  But I 
 
         did come across some of those mistakes that we

         made in the past.

			<p>First, one general observation that I 
 
         suspect everyone in this room shares and I

         really got to see firsthand in, I think, a very 
 
         special way, we are    the people out there

         doing this job, are, I think, the worthy 
 
         successors to the greatest generation that Tom 
 
         Broker wrote about.  They are people in

         Customs, in INS, in the Coast Guards, of 
 
         course, men and women overseas who have really

         risen to the challenges of, what I call, the 
 
         September 12 Era.

			<p>The issue is what kind of support 
 
         those people are going to get.  Their 
 
         dedication is constant.  Their attention spans

         are long.  I sat in on meetings of people who 
 
         have been dealing with the container, the cargo 
 
         container security issue, who have been dealing

         with this issue for 10, 11, 12 years or 20 
 
         years.  I have sat in on meetings where the

         Office of Homeland Security brought people 
 
         together for the first time from the Department 
 
         of Transportation, from Customs, the Coast

         Guard, from Treasury, the Department of State, 
 
         to deal with the problem like container

         security, or deal with the problem like 
 
         borders, and they were delighted to meet each 
 
         other.  They had all been working off in their

         corners in different places dedicated to those 
 
         issues.

			<p>Their attention span is long.  I can't 
 
         say the same, with all respect, to many of you 
 
         on this panel from members of Congress, from 
 
         members of Executive Branch and certainly from 
 
         members of the press. Their attention spans are

         quite something else.

			<p>First, let me just recount a couple of 
 
         the obvious pre 9/11 mistakes that I

         encountered.  One was that on the evening of 
 
         September 11, airline executives started to get

         a fax from the FAA.  The FAA's fax was, guess 
 
         what, a watch list, a no fly list.  Don't let 
 
         these 300 people fly.  This is the evening of

         September 11.

			<p>Airline executives had the same

         reaction that I suspect you had: 'it is too bad 
 
         we didn't get this the morning of September 11.' 
 
         There are 300 names on that list.  That list

         had been sitting around.  It had been provided 
 
         both by the CIA and the FBI to the head of

         Civil Security at the FAA, and they hadn't yet 
 
         developed over a period of months a protocol 
 
         for how to add names or subtract names from the 
 
         list, and under whose letterhead it was going 
 
         to be issued, so they hadn't issued it.  The

         evening of September 11, they decided to issue 
 
         it.

			<p>The second story that I think

         illustrates the lack of urgency.  On the 
 
         northern border, this is something that

         Inspector General Fine has reported on more 
 
         times than you are ever going to have hearings. 
 
         On the northern border they were two border

         patrol agents who in 1999 testified before 
 
         Congress about something called the "catch and

         release program."  Here is what the "catch and 
 
         release program" is.

			<p>They would catch people sneaking over

         the border in Detroit, walking through the 
 
         train tunnel or coming in on little boats on

         the shore.  They would catch them and then what 
 
         they would do is, they would give them a 
 
         self addressed postcard.  And they would hand 
 
         them the card after they caught them and 
 
         arrested them.  They would hand them this card

         and say, 'listen, when you get an address in the 
 
         United States, the country you are sneaking 
 
         into, that you are not supposed to be in, when

         you establish an address, send us back this 
 
         postcard.  Then we will know your address, and

         then we can mail you a notice of your 
 
         deportation hearing.  Then you can come for a 
 
         hearing, and then we can deport you.'  A lot of

         these people didn't really show up for 
 
         deportation hearing or send the postcards back.

			<p>They testified about it in 1999.  What 
 
         happens in October of 2001    I am sorry, not 
 
         October, the week after September 11, 2001?

         They tell a reporter for the Detroit Free Press 
 
         something less than what I have just told you.

         Much less in detail, that the northern border 
 
         isn't secure.  That we don't have the 
 
         resources.  We can't hold people in detention 
 
         when we catch them.  Guess what happens to them.
 
         They get a notice that they are going to be

         fired.

			<p>Luckily, the Inspector General stepped 
 
         in.  The office of, I think it is the Special

         Counsel Office that protects whistle blowers, 
 
         stepped in.  They did not get fired, but that

         was the INS border patrol reaction.

			<p>That policy after there was yet 
 
         another hearing in November of 2001, that

         policy has now been changed somewhat.  But this 
 
         took September 11.  It took an Inspector

         General.  It took some reports in the Detroit 
 
         Free Press before that policy    talk about 
 
         obvious gaps such as the general aviation gap,

         this is a fairly obvious gap.

			<p>One more example, just before the

         millennium there was a very well publicized 
 
         arrest of someone who was attempting to sneak 
 
         in over the northern border in Washington 
 
         State, who had plans to blow up Los Angles 
 
         Airport.

			<p>Ray Kelly, who was then the Customs 
 
         Director, thought that as a result of that, 
 
         this was a good time to reinforce the northern

         border with as many customs agents as he could 
 
         possibly send there.  His attitude, as I

         recount in the book was, I will send them there 
 
         and surely Congress will pay for it now that we 
 
         have made the arrest.  Surely the issue of the

         budget to protect the northern border going to 
 
         be solved by this obvious manifestation of the

         crisis, and those extra agents lasted for a few 
 
         months.  Congress lost interest, it went back 
 
         to being just the way it was.

			<p>The air marshals    just one more 
 
         point.  On the September 11, the air marshals,

         there was 31 U.S. air marshals in the United 
 
         States of America, none of them were on a 
 
         single airplane on the morning of September 11. 
 
         There are now, their target is something 
 
         upwards of 3,000, I think, now, and we are

         doing it urgently, and, I guess that's good.

			<p>But today as we speak the attention 
 
         span is still mixed.  It still takes the INS,

         they say, five to seven months to render an 
 
         environmental impact statement before they can

         put a pole up that will hold a camera at a 
 
         strategic point on the northern border, or to 
 
         put motion detectors.  They have to do

         environmental impact statements, five to seven 
 
         months in an administration that is not

         otherwise really quite that well known for its 
 
         sensitivity to the environment.

			<p>The dilemma of all this is    I could sit

         here for two or three hours as could the other 
 
         members of this panel and talk about the gaps.

         The really serious issue is that we can never 
 
         really be doing enough.  We can all trade 
 
         anecdotes and we can all decide that we are not 
 
         doing enough, and we really cannot do enough in 
 
         a country that has 7500 miles of border, that

         has thousands of miles of natural gas 
 
         pipelines, tens of thousands of facilities 
 
         storing or shipping dangerous chemical,

         infinite entrances to subways, to trains and to 
 
         office buildings, and just as many

         vulnerabilities relating to food or water 
 
         supply, and even to office building ventilation 
 
         systems.

			<p>So the critics that say we are not 
 
         doing enough are always going to be right.  The

         issue is, how can we make the debate and the 
 
         way we go forward a little more constructive 
 
         than that.  There is never going to be enough

         money to solve everything.  I think the 
 
         opportunity that this Commission has, that some

         independent nonpartisan body can have, whether 
 
         it is the GAO or a commission like this that 
 
         goes forward, that goes on, is that it can set 
 
         specific tangible standards for improvement in 
 
         homeland security.  It can set up, to give you

         an example, it can declare that if we have our 
 
         undercover people who work for a commission 
 
         like this, trying to sneak something into the

         port, it should be detected by Customs, by 
 
         Homeland Security 99.6 percent of the time and

         let's give the American people a report every 
 
         quarter or every half year of how we are doing. 
 
         Let's set goals.  We can target these things

         and we can set goals.  We can't do everything.

			<p>The debate we have today is really one

         where it is easy to be partisan.  It is really 
 
         easy because you can always say, if there is a 
 
         terror attack, and there is going to be another

         terror attack, and when there is whether it is 
 
         in the subways, or general aviation or ports,

         there will always be a way to point and say 
 
         that somebody screwed up.

			<p>For example, Customs has initiated a 
 
         very intelligent program in risk management 
 
         called The Customs Partnership.  What they do

         is, they prescreen the truck drivers who drive 
 
         the most over the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit. 
 
         They are screened in advance and because they

         are screened they get something which gets them 
 
         on a fast line.  That is really intelligent.

         We can all sit here and say that is 
 
         intelligent.

			<p>The test for this country, the test

         for the dialogue we are all going to have is 
 
         that if, God forbid, one of the people who has

         gone through that screening does something 
 
         terrible, are we going to have all kinds of 
 
         recriminations and say, "we should stop every

         truck.  That was a stupid plan, how could we 
 
         have done it."  Or are we going say, "well, we

         started a system, the system still makes sense. 
 
         It didn't work in this case, that doesn't mean 
 
         we scrap the system and go back to what we were 
 
         doing at the airports on September 12, which 
 
         was checking everybody, no matter who they were

         or what they were."

			<p>The point I am really trying to make 
 
         is that we have to think about intelligent risk

         management.  The most important place we have 
 
         to think about it is in the private sector, or

         certainly not the Federal sector.  There are 
 
         1750 check points at all the airports in the 
 
         United States of America combined, 1750.  There

         are approximately 1760 entrances to the New York 
 
         City subway system.  We all agree that TSA is

         doing a great job.

			<p>So for only $6 billion and 45,000 new 
 
         employees, we could protect the New York City

         subway system the way we are protecting the 
 
         airports.

			<p>For those of us who ride the subway, 
 
         that sounds like a pretty good idea, but we 
 
         can't do that.  And by the way, when we decide 
 
         to do that we have to deal with the 17,000 
 
         entrances to office buildings in Manhattan.

         When we get through there, we probably want to 
 
         start thinking about Chicago, San Francisco, 
 
         Los Angles and everywhere else.

			<p>We can't simply throw that kind money 
 
         at the problem.  We have to get the private

         sector involved.  I think we have to have 
 
         something on the order of a voluntary identity 
 
         card that companies in the private sector can

         issue to people that screens them, voluntarily, 
 
         so that when we have lines, as we are going to

         have in office systems, subway stations and 
 
         train terminals, we are going to have those 
 
         lines after the next attack.  And when we do

         that we are managing the risk a little more 
 
         rationally.

			<p>The one thought I really want to leave 
 
         you with is, I think the best thing a 
 
         commission like this can do is either suggest 
 
         or else go and do it itself, setting specific 
 
         goals in all the areas you are talking about.

         And then instead of the Democrats criticizing 
 
         the Republicans for not spending enough money 
 
         here, and the Republicans saying yes, but we

         have reorganized the Government and we now have 
 
         this department so obviously we are doing

         enough.  We hold a press conference to say we 
 
         are spending this much money here, that is not 
 
         a constructive debate.

			<p>You can quantify this.  You can manage 
 
         this the way people in the private sector

         manage lots of problems by settling specific 
 
         goals, specific timetables, and having a 
 
         nonpartisan body report on how we are doing.

			<p>I thank you.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  If it is acceptable to the

         other members of the panel, knowing Mr. Brill 
 
         has to leave, is it all right if he takes five 
 
         minutes of questioning now? 
 
			<p>MR. BRILL:  Thank you for you 
 
         courtesy.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  I understand that.  In that 
 
         case Commissioner Ben Veniste and Commissioner 
 
         Fielding will ask five minutes worth of

         questions.

			<p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  Mr. Brill, I am

         quite interested in the fact that you have, in 
 
         the course of the past year or so, spoken to 
 
         people who are on the front line of protecting

         the United States in the post 9/11 environment, 
 
         and have not limited yourself to those who are

         in supervisory positions, who are at the very 
 
         top of the agencies.

			<p>You state that it is necessary to

         demonstrate our support for these individuals 
 
         whose views in the long term, rather than in

         less optimal kinds of supervision, that 
 
         Congress and others are able to maintain.

			<p>How would you coordinate that kind of, 
 
         or conform that kind of appreciation for to 
 
         those who are dedicated to protecting this

         country, with the kind of accountability and 
 
         review that is also necessary for us to conduct 
 
         so that we may inform our recommendations, at

         the end of the day, with a body of information 
 
         that not only provides an historical record,

         but provides a baseline for our 
 
         recommendations?

			<p>MR. BRILL:  I think that's the

         challenge.  I don't want to minimize that 
 
         challenge.  Indeed, if I just sat here and

         said, well, you know you need to have as many 
 
         whistle blowers as possible come and sit at 
 
         this table and tell you what's wrong with each

         and every Federal agency, that would be much 
 
         too simple.  A lot of whistle blowers just have

         gripes that relate to labor problems, or their 
 
         own personal problems, they haven't been 
 
         promoted or they are just unhappy.  All 
 
         organizations have that.

			<p>So it is not simply, "let the whistle

         blowers speak."  It is much more trying to set 
 
            just to give you an example, if Washington 
 
         says that the ports are safer and, by the way,

         the ports are safer.  The 2 percent number is a 
 
         fiction.  They are inspecting a much higher

         ratio of the truly dangerous cargo and they deserve 
 
         a lot of credit for that, but the people who 
 
         deserve the credit for that are not only Bob

         Bonner and his team in Washington, but the 
 
         customs inspectors on the port that I sat with

         here in New Jersey, and in other places, who 
 
         devised their own factoring system so that they 
 
         could take a container and have notice of a

         container and decide which ones were the high 
 
         risk containers.

			<p>What happened was, Washington, they 
 
         consulted with those people and said, you tell 
 
         us, tell us what should be in this list of a 
 
         hundred or two hundred factors that we should 
 
         look at.  You guys have the experience.  There

         are some agencies that do that, there are other 
 
         agencies don't.  If you want a sweeping 
 
         generalization I will give you one; Customs  

         good, INS   bad.

			<p>There is no deadline the INS has ever

         had in anyone's memory in this room that they 
 
         have ever met.  There is nothing they have ever 
 
         said they are going to do that they ever did.

         I keep kidding my friend, Tom Ridge, that is 
 
         now your problem and I can't wait to see how

         you solve it.  Because a lot of people, 
 
         including some of the people at this table, 
 
         such as the former Deputy Attorney General,

         have been in charge of solving that problem and 
 
         haven't solved it.

			<p>But the way to do it is, again, to try 
 
         to take the politics out of it.  It is easy for 
 
         a senator to say you are not spending enough 
 
         money on this because you can never spend 
 
         enough, and it is easy for people in power to

         hold a press conference saying we are do doing 
 
         this, we are doing this, we are doing this. 
 
         They are right, they are, and they are well

         motivated sincere people.

			<p>The issue is, we don't care what you

         say, what we want to know is, is the port 
 
         x percent safer today than it was last month? 
 
         Is general aviation any safer?

			<p>The way Washington has solved general 
 
         aviation issue is, you can't fly into National

         Airport.  That is the one thing they have done, 
 
         that the gentleman here didn't talk about. 
 
         That is the only safety measure, so far, for

         general aviation.  There have got to be other 
 
         standards you can set for that.  There ought to

         be productivity standards.  This management 
 
         goal, this management goal, did you meet it, 
 
         did you not meet it?  And that takes a 
 
         nonpartisan group, like the group assembled 
 
         here, who can issue reports to the country the

         way we get economic reports every quarter.  We 
 
         are this much safer here, we are not safer 
 
         there.

			<p>MR. BEN VENISTE: Just to follow up    

			<p>MR. KEAN:  I just want to get

         Commissioner Fielding in.  We only have two 
 
         minutes of questions.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  I just want you to

         thank you for sugarcoating your comments about 
 
         the INS.

			<p>MR. BRILL:  Actually, they were 
 
         sugarcoated.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  I am sure they were.

			<p>MR. BRILL:  No profanities or 
 
         anything.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  Just to follow up, 
 
         since we are short on time.  One of our tasks 
 
         is to try to figure out what's the best way to 
 
         proceed every day as we go forward, because we 
 
         get a little bit of information and then we get

         a little bit more and we try to put it all 
 
         together in some sort of a mosaic.

			<p>We have hearings like this, where

         people come in and are limited by their time, 
 
         by their statements and that sort of thing.  So

         we are very free and easy to ask of people, 
 
         such as yourself, if you would stay with us and 
 
         cooperate with us as we move forward?

			<p>MR. BRILL:  I would love to.  This is 
 
         a particularly bad day for me, today   

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  I understand that.

			<p>MR. BRILL:  I will spend all day any 
 
         day to help you with this.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  You obviously have a 
 
         list of people or categories of people that we

         could learn from as we move forward.  We don't 
 
         intend to only speak with people in charge.

			<p>MR. BRILL:  I certainly didn't mean to 
 
         imply that either.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  I understand that.  So

         if you could do that.

			<p>The other thing which I think we could 
 
         call upon you, is obviously goals and standards

         could be the same management issues as anything 
 
         else.  We have to figure out and prioritize

         goals and standards so that we may have goals 
 
         for bus traffic, but we might not have goals 
 
         for taxis.

			<p>MR. BRILL:  Exactly.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  There, again, I would

         hope that we could call on you as we work our 
 
         way through this.  Thank you.

			<p>MR. BRILL:  Thank you.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you very much, Mr. 
 
         Brill.

			<p>MR. BRILL:  You're welcome.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  I call on Mr. Wermuth.

			<p>MR. WERMUTH:  Thank you Mr. Chairman, 
 
         Mr. Vice Chairman, distinguished members of the 
 
         panel.  Thank you for the opportunity to be

         here today.

			<p>As many of you know from other 
 
         positions that you have held, RAND has been

         doing terrorism research and analysis for more 
 
         than 35 years.  We have some of the leading

         experts in the country who have been involved 
 
         in that process for a long time.  In fact, at 
 
         least one and perhaps more will appear before

         this panel in the coming days.

			<p>I am going talk primarily about the

         work that we have been honored to do for the 
 
         last four years now, in providing the research 
 
         and analytical support to the advisory panel to

         assess domestic response capabilities for 
 
         terrorism involving weapons of mass

         destruction, also euphemistically known as the 
 
         Gilmore Commission.

			<p>From the written testimony that I 
 
         submitted, you will see the Congressional 
 
         authority for the creation of that panel, and

         its specific Congressional mandate, a lot of 
 
         information on the composition of that panel 
 
         and why many people think that panel is unique

         primarily because it is made of men and women 
 
         who represent the first response or community,

         people in law enforcement, fire services, 
 
         emergency medical services, public health as 
 
         well as people who have Washington experience

         and intelligence, and military affairs and 
 
         other matters.

			<p>This panel lost one of its most 
 
         distinguished members in the attacks of 
 
         September 11, Ray Downey, Deputy Department

         Chief of Special Operations of the Fire 
 
         Department of the City of New York.  Of course,

         the incident commander on the day of those 
 
         attacks died in the collapse of the North Tower that 
 
         morning. 
 
			<p>You will see from the written 
 
         testimony, in considerable detail, that this

         panel has been very consistent from its 
 
         inception, and long before September 11, 2001, 
 
         it submitted its first report to the President

         and the Congress in December of 1999.  It has 
 
         now submitted four and will submit a fifth in

         December of this year, before it goes out of
 
         business.

			<p>But throughout its deliberations and

         policy pronouncements to President and Congress, 
 
         it has consistently adhered to the view that

         intelligence is key to this entire effort.  And 
 
         that the proper organizational structure, the 
 
         proper coordination of intelligence collection,

         analysis and dissemination, not only within a 
 
         few select federal agencies, but even with

         state and local response entities, and now what 
 
         is becoming increasingly obvious is that 
 
         perhaps key elements of the private sector have 
 
         to be included in that process.  That getting 
 
         the intelligence piece right is paramount to

         everything that we do.

			<p>Prior panelists, I am sure others on 
 
         this panel will continue to note that we are

         infinitely vulnerable.  We cannot defend 
 
         against everything.  We cannot secure and

         protect against everything.  The importance of 
 
         intelligence and getting that intelligence into 
 
         the hands of people who need it is critical to

         all of our efforts. The nexus between 
 
         intelligence and law enforcement is also

         critical.

			<p>Having people both in the 
 
         intelligence world and all law enforcement

         world, understand and appreciate what the other 
 
         parts of all of that effort really means.

			<p>This panel started in 1999 and 
 
         throughout its reports have made significant 
 
         substantive recommendations about both 
 
         structure and process for improving our 
 
         intelligence collection analysis and

         dissemination efforts.

			<p>In December of 2000, in its second 
 
         report, it recommended the creation of an

         entity in the Executive Office of the 
 
         President.  Similar, though not exactly, to

         what eventually became the Office of Homeland 
 
         Security under Tom Ridge.  As part of that 
 
         recommendation this panel said we need a better

         structure.  We need a coordinated intelligence 
 
         effort that brings together all of the

         agencies, as well as state and local response 
 
         entities.  To have a more complete, a more 
 
         comprehensive, a more effective way of

         gathering and disseminating intelligence 
 
         information.

			<p>In subsequent reports the panel has 
 
         continued with those themes in ways to improve 
 
         some of the specific pieces of intelligence 
 
         operations in its most recent report, and that 
 
         is also detailed for you in the written

         testimony.  We have also provided copies of 
 
         that report to the Commission staff for each 
 
         of you to have.

			<p>The panel recommended the creation of 
 
         something that it called the "National Counterterrorism Center" an all source intelligence 
 
         fusion analysis and dissemination center that 
 
         would be comprised of pieces of the various

         agencies directly involved.  The Central 
 
         Intelligence Agency, the Department of Justice,

         other components of the intelligence community, 
 
         to bring together all of the raw intelligence 
 
         data, if you will, and to try to make some

         sense out of that in a comprehensive fashion. 
 
         To include in that process, representatives of

         states and localities that would also help to 
 
         inform through their resources, all the way 
 
         down to the local beat cop on the street, and 
 
         to develop the best possible intelligence 
 
         products for dissemination to people who have

         need to know that information.

			<p>The President announced in his State 
 
         to the Union address, something called the

         Terrorism Threat Integration Center.  Something 
 
         similar to what this panel had recommended two

         months before, not exactly the same and I would 
 
         be happy to address the differences between 
 
         what this panel recommended and what the

         President has called for.  But needless to say, 
 
         this panel was focused on this and a number of

         other issues that you can see in our reports, 
 
         long before September 11.  It has been open and 
 
         unabashed about its policy recommendations.

			<p>One of the things that it has said 
 
         consistently with all due deference to the

         former United States senators and the two 
 
         former members of Congress on this panel, but 
 
         Congress still doesn't have its act together.  
 
         It is getting better, but for a long time was 
 
         not willing to organize itself in a way that

         would address these issues more effectively. 
 
         At least the House of Representatives have now 
 
         started doing do that.

			<p>With that, I will complete my oral 
 
         remarks by thanking you again for the

         opportunity to be here and to offer this 
 
         Commission any assistance that this advisory 
 
         panel can provide to you and, of course,

         anything that the RAND Corporation and any of 
 
         it components can do, to help you with your

         very challenging tasks in the months ahead.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you, Mr. Wermuth.  I 
 
         have a feeling we will be taking you up on that

         offer.

			<p>Zoe Baird.

			<p>MS. BAIRD:  Thank you very much.  I 
 
         appreciate the opportunity to be here.  We all, 
 
         in our small way, hope that we can honor the 
 
         memories of victims of 9/11 and we thank you 
 
         for giving us this opportunity to contribute

         to your effort to do that.

			<p>I have a few comments I would like to 
 
         make, but I must say that my contribution to

         this Commission is already so large that 
 
         anything else I say will be purely redundant

         and additive because you have the privilege of 
 
         having the Executive Director of the Markle 
 
         Task Force now as your executive director, and

         that will be the most important decision you 
 
         have made.  So I commend you.  And if I can

         help in other ways too, I am happy to.

			<p>Our task force was focused on the use 
 
         of information in order to prevent terrorism

         and protect the national security.  September 11 
 
         exposed for world view what was already well

         known in Washington, that we needed to reform 
 
         our intelligence and information systems in 
 
         order to deal with new threats. 
 
			<p>I had the privilege of serving in 1995 
 
         on a congressionally created commission on the

         future roles and missions of the intelligence 
 
         community, and at that point in time there was 
 
         no mandate from Congress to look at terrorism

         or weapons of mass destruction.  We added it to 
 
         our agenda, but it wasn't in the public debate

         as an important future role for the 
 
         intelligence community.

			<p>That is of great significance because

         we had several years which would have been 
 
         terribly important to develop the capabilities

         we need to protect the country in which we 
 
         didn't do that.  Where we had few people who 
 
         spoke the languages we needed to understand.

         Where we didn't begin to think about the 
 
         revamping of the very essence of how we do

         business and intelligence and information 
 
         sharing.  But instead we tried to patch a 
 
         system that was designed against a singular 
 
         state enemy instead of trying to understand the 
 
         new enemies and emerging threats.

			<p>I think that you can't fail to look at 
 
         that as you do your work, because you need to 
 
         know what we have to do differently now.

			<p>There is a great deal of discussion in 
 
         Washington about the need for every agency to

         invest in filling these stove pipes with more 
 
         information, or in connecting the dots and 
 
         connecting information between agencies.  But

         that is the same debate that we had about 
 
         revamping the intelligence community in 1995

         and 1996.  It is using the same model of how we 
 
         have always done business, to say that we 
 
         should be able to do more of it.

			<p>The current need is radically 
 
         different.  You have heard from a number of

         people about the need for information down at 
 
         the ends of the system, if you will, with state 
 
         and local responders, with police, with 
 
         firefighters.  You know the numbers, you know 
 
         there are 11,000 plus FBI agents and there are

         50 times that in terms of state and local law 
 
         enforcers.  What do we want these people to be 
 
         doing?  What is their role in the system?

			<p>We don't, in this country, want a 
 
         system which will make all of those people and

         the UPS truck drivers intelligence agents.  Our 
 
         country isn't worth protecting if it becomes a 
 
         police state where everyone is collecting

         information and putting it into massive 
 
         databases that we can then run programs against

         in order to find out who is doing what.

			<p>But we do need to develop a system 
 
         which moves the information to the people in

         local communities who need it when they need, 
 
 and what they need, not everything, but

         what they need.  We need to have a system that 
 
         pulls that information into central places in 
 
         Federal Government when it is needed for the 
 
         purposes that it is needed.

			<p>That system    our task force which

         was composed of one of the imminent members of 
 
         your panel, Senator Gorton, as well as the 
 
         whole range of people with experience both in

         Washington and in intelligence and on the Hill, 
 
         as well as people from the state and local

         governments, and quite a number of people from 
 
         the information technology community.

			<p>We looked at this problem and we said

         the system can be built in a way that both 
 
         enhances security and protects the privacy and

         liberty interests.  As long as those two 
 
         interests are the key design elements for the 
 
         system, and it is built together, that the

         system can be built with existing technology. 
 
         This is not a matter of creating substantial

         new technologies over a long period of time 
 
         that are more sophisticated and do more.  In 
 
         fact, a great deal of what we want to be able 
 
         to do, is already done in the private sector.

			<p>So the question then becomes, how do

         you construct the system in a way that is 
 
         comprehensive in the reach of who can 
 
         participate in it, but not undermining of the

         civil liberties of people about whom you 
 
         collect information.

			<p>Our conclusion is that the essence of 
 
         doing that, is that the President has to 
 
         develop guidelines for creating the balance

         between privacy and security, and that there 
 
         needs to be a public debate about what the

         criteria should be for those guidelines.

			<p>We made a number of recommendations in 
 
         our report, but your forum may be a very good

         one in which to inspire the public debate. 
 
         Because as Steve Brill was saying and others,

         unfortunately we still swing wildly and polemically from the 
 
         "protect security," to the "protect privacy" sides 
 
         of the spectrum, and it doesn't do us any good 
 
         to have a unanimous resolution passed to shut 
 
         down a program on privacy grounds, and then to

         have actions taken by the Attorney General 
 
         without consultation on security grounds.

			<p>We are swinging back and forth in a

         way which won't enhance security and we are 
 
         doing it in a political environment, which is

         just going to leave people sitting here a year 
 
         from now when you report, feeling no more 
 
         secure than they do today.

			<p>We couldn't possibly harden all the 
 
         targets.  I mean, this is a refrain you will

         hear from everyone.  Even if you pursue the 
 
         kind of management tool that Steve was talking 
 
         about, which seems very, very sensible, you

         will still not be able to harden all the 
 
         targets.

			<p>So what do you need to do?  You need 
 
         to have an information system that enables you 
 
         to know who it is that is in the country who is 
 
         hostile and might be inclined to undertake 
 
         these actions.  And when does that hostility

         merge with the capability to actually carry out 
 
         an action, so that you have a real threat to 
 
         the country.  That is an information challenge.

         People who are hostile do us no harm unless 
 
         they also have the capability to act.

			<p>You need information on both sides of 
 
         that, and you need to understand when those 
 
         come together to actually create a threat.

			<p>We know that if we had used the 
 
         information we already had on 9/11, that there

         is a great deal we would have learned, that 
 
         two of these terrorists were on the INS 
 
         terrorist watch list, that they had common

         addresses and common frequent flyer numbers 
 
         with other terrorists.

			<p>Now, out of the vast amount of 
 
         information, even if we had the kind of systems 
 
         that we talk about, could we have prevented 
 
         that attack?  I can't tell you that we could 
 
         have.  But we could have felt much, much better

         about the role our government plays in 
 
         protecting our citizens, which is one of its 
 
         highest callings.

			<p>Therefore, it seems to me that as we 
 
         are looking at what we need to do in the

         immediate term, we need to have the public 
 
         debate that talks about the balance between 
 
         privacy and security.  The President needs to

         develop guidelines which will govern the 
 
         Federal Government and inform the states and

         localities, and we need to, in addition, invest 
 
         in state and local governments being part of 
 
         this system, because the funding isn't there

         for them to participate.

			<p>There are some very good people doing

         good work in their local areas, but they don't 
 
         have the guidelines that empower them and 
 
        constrain them, and they don't have the funds to 
 
         undertake what they need to pursue.

			<p>So with that I will close my comments

         and be happy to answer questions.  Thank you.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you very much.  Mr. 
 
         Larsen.

			<p>MR. LARSEN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, 
 
         distinguished members.  At the Institute for

         Homeland Security we have been working on this 
 
         specific topic for about three years.  We are 
 
         just about ready to finish and submit a report

         which we will provide copies to this Committee. 
 
         It will not be released to the general public,

         due to the sensitive nature.

			<p>We have focussed on intelligence and 
 
         law enforcement from a somewhat nontraditional

         perspective.  We got together 15 senior people 
 
         from each of four communities; law enforcement,

         intelligence, public health and agriculture, to 
 
         look at how they could better share 
 
         information.  Food supply is a great concern in 
 
         this country about how it could be attacked.

			<p>We have discovered there are great

         cultural barriers to that.  It took us about 
 
         six hours to figure out what "business casual" 
 
         meant with that community in our first outset.

         When the word "prevention" came up we found out 
 
         that people in the intelligence community have

         a completely different definition than people 
 
         from public health or agriculture.

			<p>In the Department of Defense where I

         spent 32 years, we have a DOD dictionary of 
 
         military and associated terms.  So we all know

         what the term "general war" means.  We may not 
 
         agree with it, but that's what the Secretary of 
 
         Defence signed.  That does not happen in interagency

         community, but we will be happy to 
 
         provide a copy of that, and I think you will

         find it interesting.

			<p>I submitted my comments last week so I 
 
         will not repeat them, but I will highlight 
 
         three issues from there.  I see from the letter 
 
         that I was sent from this Commission it says

         you are chartered to prepare full and complete 
 
         account of the circumstances surrounding the 
 
         events of September 11, 2001.  As a tax payer,

         I would prefer that you focus on the future, 
 
         not the past.  If this Commission were

         beginning one month after 9/11, that might be 
 
         available.  I have seen so many changes, I am 
 
         not sure of the value looking at the old

         system.

			<p>When I say you should focus on the

         future, I am not talking about next year, 
 
         because you are not going to fix it for the 
 
         next year, about what we need in the 21st century.

         I think your focus should be out around the 
 
         five year point, about which this country is

         going to need.

			<p>I think there are two alternative 
 
         futures for the day you release your report.  I 
 
         believe May of next year.  One of them will be, 
 
         there will be in new attacks on the American

         Homeland and the American people, and Congress 
 
         will expect a certain sort of recommendation 
 
         from a Commission that is operating in that

         environment.

			<p>The other alternative is, I think is,

         we could have had several attacks, perhaps major 
 
         attacks, perhaps even an attack with a weapon 
 
         of mass destruction.  And I think the American

         people and Congress would expect a completely 
 
         different recommendation from this committee.

			<p>I think we all understand that 9/11 
 
         was not what changed everything.  It is the 
 
         technological revolution that has changed

         the threat to hour homeland.  Because of the 
 
         technological resolution small nations and

         small well financed terrorist organizations can 
 
         threaten our survival in this country.  That is 
 
         the scenario you must work with because that is 
 
         going to happen whether it is next month, next 
 
         year or five years, we know there has been a

         fundamental change in the international 
 
         security equation.  That is what you must deal 
 
         with.

			<p>We did an exercise last November, John 
 
         Hamre from CSIS and myself led Silent Vector.

         It was the follow on to the Dark Winter 
 
         exercise that we did 18 months ago.  I have 
 
         given you a handout from Silent Vector, and

         once again I apologize, because we cannot 
 
         release this to the public.  It is not

         classified or anything, but we think it is 
 
         sensitive and we don't like to provide 
 
         terrorists information that would end up in the

         newspapers or something.

			<p>But what we discovered when we were

         working on this exercise was, it was an 
 
         unusual.  Senior leaders, Sam Nunn played the 
 
         President; Jim Woolsey played Bill Sessions 
 
         former FBI Governor, Governor Gilmore played 
 
         Governor of Virginia.  The attack never

         occurred in the exercise.  It was about 
 
         specific incredible intelligence information 
 
         coming in, and John Hamre and I wanted to see

         where we could force them to make decisions 
 
         that would have an enormous economic impact,

         perhaps even more than the attack itself, what 
 
         they would do.

			<p>What we discovered in the six months

         that we were preparing for the exercise was, 
 
         there is no system in the Federal Government

         today, no organization that looks at 
 
         intelligence information that flows in, law 
 
         enforcement information and a vulnerability

         assessment and puts them into a fusion center, 
 
         or as some people like to say, an integration

         center to look at all this.  And then combine 
 
         that with the sort of data binding capabilities 
 
         other panel members were talking about, that 
 
         could then provide real time information to 
 
         senior elected and appointed officials about

         how to use their limited resources.  If you are 
 
         the president, governor, mayor or county 
 
         executive.  How do you do that?

			<p>I spent a lot of time talking to 
 
         mayors and chiefs of police.  Two weeks ago I

         was talking to the Sheriffs' Association of 
 
         Illinois and I said, how would you know what's 
 
         protecting your county, if I told you there is

         a specific threat?  Where is your big 
 
         vulnerability?

			<p>With a chart like this, and this is 
 
         rather simple, that just eight people put 
 
         together over a few months.  There is no

         organization doing this.

			<p>Now the NAPSI that I know, Commission,

         you worked on for a while, was somewhat focused 
 
         on the cyber aspects of it, and it was a good 
 
         model because they did look at all sources of 
 
         intelligence information, law enforcement, but 
 
         I don't think the vulnerability assessment

         covered enough of the physical.

			<p>But when you look at this, we came up 
 
         with some very specific information, if you

         only have limited resources to use your 
 
         national guard or state troopers or whatever,

         it gives you an idea where you have got to go. 
 
         This integration center we are talking about, 
 
         is not only valuable for prevention, it is also

         valuable for how we are going to spend the 
 
         money for mitigation and response.

			<p>This sort of center could provide that 
 
         information on as a vulnerability assessment, 
 
         what the threats are, what the capabilities

         are, what the intentions are, so we know where 
 
         to spend our money.

			<p>Because my bottom line and the whole 
 
         thing about homeland security, and I began 
 
         studying this in 1994, biological warfare is 
 
         what brought me into the homeland security 
 
         business.  My greatest threat, even though I am

         very worried about the future of genetically 
 
         engineered biological weapons, which I think is 
 
         a very serious threat, Nuclear weapons, cyber

         weapons, you name it.  The one that I fear the 
 
         most is uncontrolled spending.  If we do not

         establish the right priorities, we will spend 
 
         ourselves into bankruptcy like the Soviet Union 
 
         did in the Cold War.

			<p>7500 miles of border, are we going to 
 
         spend billions on building imaginal lines along

         our border, when Ramsey Josef in 1993 attacked 
 
         the World Trade Center with a bomb built across 
 
         the river.  Timothy McVeigh built his bomb in

         Kansas.  When Aum Shinrikyo made their sarin, 
 
         they made it in Tokyo a few miles from where

         they attacked.

			<p>The only weapon you need to bring 
 
         across our border is a nuclear weapon.  You 
 
         don't even need to bring a radiological 
 
         disposal device across our border.  I saw a

         picture in a newspaper the other day, one of 
 
         these scanners that looks at the shipping 
 
         containers.  The x ray uses cesium 137.  That

         is one of the best things to use for 
 
         radiological disposal device.  You just put the

         bomb in the container, you don't even need the 
 
         radiological material, it is in the x ray 
 
         machine right there at the port.

			<p>My point is, we cannot build a Maginot
 
         line.  I am concerned about setting priorities

         and I think that's the most valuable thing this 
 
         Commission can provide American people.  A 
 
         sense of priorities on this information

         integration center that will help not only for 
 
         prevention, but mitigation and response.

			<p>That information will be most important.  It 
 
         will be the best investment this country can 
 
         make in security. 
 
			<p>Thank you, sir.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you, Mr. Larsen.

         Commissioner Ben Veniste and Commission 
 
         Fielding.

			<p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  Can I first turn to

         Mr. Wermuth and Ms. Baird.  First of all, we 
 
         are very grateful for your contribution.  You

         have submitted very important materials that go 
 
         far beyond your oral presentations today, and 
 
         we thank you for those and for your pledge of

         cooperation, which we will take you up on.

			<p>To comment very briefly on Mr.

         Larsen's observation as a tax payer; we are 
 
         charged by our statute to investigate the 
 
         circumstances of 9/11, but we are not starting

         from September 12.  We are building upon the 
 
         very good work done by the Joint Inquiry and

         other entities which have investigated that, 
 
         and our mandate is to use that material as a 
 
         jumping off point to conclude the 
 
         investigation, hopefully, to provide a 
 
         definitive review of what went wrong on

         September 11 that will withstand historical 
 
         scrutiny.  But we are not going to reinvent the 
 
         wheel, and please be assured of that.

			<p>Both of you have talked about the 
 
         balance between technological improvements for

         our security and the imperative of protecting 
 
         our civil liberties.  There is obviously a 
 
         great deal of tension between those two.

			<p>I am interested that, Ms. Baird, you 
 
         have suggested that this Commission may be an

         appropriate forum for the national debate with 
 
         respect to those perhaps competing objectives. 
 
         Protecting our security and yet protecting our

         civil rights, for it is quite clear that if we 
 
         spend days hiding under the table or afraid

         because of increased scrutiny on us, that our 
 
         civil liberties are gone.  Then our opponents 
 
         will have won a victory just as easily as Mr. 
 
         Larsen has said, we spend ourselves into 
 
         bankruptcy as the Soviet Union did.

			<p>So I would like to ask you to 
 
         elaborate on what you view as the principal 
 
         points between enhanced security and protection

         of our civil liberties.

			<p>MR. WERMUTH:  The advisory panel has,

         on more than one occasion, used a quotation, I 
 
         think, to describe how it feels about that 
 
         issue and the quote goes, "They that would give

         up essential liberty for a little temporary 
 
         safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety." 
         That's Benjamin Franklin in 1759.

			<p>This panel has been focused on civil 
 
         liberties.  It has said consistently the civil

         liberties of the citizens of the United States 
 
         are really what make us unique in the all the

         world.  Nobody else has the kind of system and 
 
         protections for civil rights and privacy 
 
         considerations that we do in the United States. 
 
			<p>Having said that, the panel has 
 
         articulated ways that we can use existing laws.

         We don't need significantly expanded laws, more 
 
         intrusive capability.  A lot of this is 
 
         structure and process.  It is simply taking

         things that we can already acquire under our 
 
         laws, whether it is through the Foreign

         Intelligence Surveillance Act or other court 
 
         supervised activities, or simply information 
 
         that can be gathered legally in any number of

         other contexts.

			<p>The idea is to bring all that

         information together and to fuse it, to use 
 
         that term of the vernacular, to analyze it, to 
 
         create some products out of it that makes sense

         and then get it into the hands of people who 
 
         need to have it.

			<p>This panel has been concerned,  Randy 
 
         mentioned, with subsequent terrorist attacks.  This 
 
         panel has been concerned that we have an 
 
         opportunity now to get this right, structurally 
 
         and process wise.  If we don't, the hue and cry

         from the American public, if it is still wrong 
 
         when the next attack occurs, may cause that 
 
         pendulum to swing too far, and we will feel

         compelled or there will be public pressure to 
 
         compel the Government, perhaps, to be more

         intrusive, to chip away at civil liberties. 
 
         The men and women, at least of this 
 
         organization and certainly RAND's research has

         been articulating that over the years, we 
 
         don't want to do that.  We want to find things

         that are consistent with the Constitution, 
 
         consistent with the statutes that are on the 
 
         books and protections that we have, where we

         don't find ourselves under the kind of pressure 
 
         of another attack or pending attacks where we

         do something.  That is not consistent with 
 
         those values that we have held for so long and 
 
         make us then very much like a lot of other 
 
         countries who don't have the kinds of 
 
         protection that we do.

			<p>MS. BAIRD:  I would suggest that there 
 
         are two ways that you might look at this 
 
         question.  First of all, the development of

         guidelines are really the essence of striking 
 
         that balance.  And what I mean by "guidelines"

         are directives that make very clear for people 
 
         in the system, from Washington out into the 
 
         local communities.  What it is that they can do

         and what it is that they can't do.  What they 
 
         are empowered to do and what the limits are on

         their actions.

			<p>Right now we have a drive for unfocused 
 
         collection of information everywhere, and then

         even less focused or less targeted oversight 
 
         of the collection of that information.  We have

         privacy czars, we have Congressional oversight 
 
         bodies, and everyone is trying to grab at what 
 
         they think is the area where they need to limit 
 
         what's going on.

			<p>The dynamic then that gets set up is

         those who have these weighty responsibilities, 
 
         who don't want to be sitting here in front of 
 
         you having failed when another terrorist attack

         occurs, are doing everything they can to use 
 
         information to provide security.  But they

         don't have guidance and accountability being 
 
         assumed by policy makers for what it is they 
 
         should be doing, and what the limits are of

         what they should be doing.

			<p>So you have a system that really does

         not provide either security or privacy.  So 
 
         these guidelines, we believe, are really the 
 
         essence of making the clear determinations

         about what kind of information we need, who 
 
         needs to have it, who should be providing it,

         and how that information moves in and out of 
 
         those who need it, both in the public sector 
 
         and the private sector. 
 
			<p>The other part of this guideline 
 
         point that I would make is, that a great deal

         of the information that we need to enhance 
 
         security is in the private sector.  It is our 
 
         belief that it ought to stay in the private

         sector and be drawn on the when the Government 
 
         needs it.  This is not necessarily popular in

         the private sector because it creates an 
 
         obligation and a relationship with the government 
 
         which doesn't exist in every part of the

         private sector, but where it does exist in the 
 
         financial services community, for example, it

         has been very successful and not unduly 
 
         burdensome for the private sector.  Again, with 
 
         very clear guidelines about what kind of

         information people in the private sector are
 
         required to retain, for how long, how it is

         accessed and what their liability is for that.

			<p>Just again to be brief, the second 
 
         point that I would make, that I would encourage 
 
         you to look at, is the responsibility of the 
 
         FBI in relationship to other agencies of the

         Government.

			<p>It is our belief that the FBI should 
 
         do collection, if you will,

         the kind of law enforcement collection of 
 
         information that the FBI undertakes now; but

         that the FBI should not be the agency that is 
 
         our equivalent of a domestic intelligence 
 
         agency.  We won't probably ever say we have a

         domestic intelligence agency, but in fact, the 
 
         collection of information to inform policy

         makers, which is what intelligence is, as 
 
         opposed to information that is collected for 
 
         law enforcement. It is our belief should be driven

         out of the Department of Homeland Security.

			<p>That is for important civil liberty

         reasons as well as capabilities of different 
 
         agencies, because if the people who collect the 
 
         information are those who can take away your 
 
         liberty by arresting you, then there is a 
 
         greater threat to civil liberties from the

         collection of information by the government, 
 
         and it is unnecessary given that we have to 
 
         build this capability for the first time

         somewhere.  So we concluded that building it at 
 
         the FBI was not the right place, again, as part

         of that balance.

			<p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  We are going to 
 
         drill down a little further on who gets the

         authority for the collection and dissemination, 
 
         because I think each of you have a different

         views about that.  But just to follow up on 
 
         this point, what I hear from both of you is 
 
         that the means that we have available,

         presently existing, are sufficient.  That there 
 
         is no great need for some other silver bullet

         kind of intrusive collection mechanism, but 
 
         rather the dissemination, the coordination was 
 
         the failure. 
 
			<p>As we go forward and recognizing the 
 
         imperative of individuals who are charged with

         guarding our homeland security, and their 
 
         natural response to the obligations they have, 
 
         where do you see the point of where the rubber

         meets the road on the civil liberties issue? 
 
         Where do you see it coming down?

			<p>MS. BAIRD:  One way to look at that is 
 
         the question of whether you need to collect 
 
         information on individuals, or at what point do

         you need to collect information on individuals, 
 
         and what kind of information.  For example, if

         a police officer stops Mohamed Atta and needs 
 
         to go to a database to find out about this 
 
         person, he doesn't know need to know everything

         about Mohamed Atta.  He just needs to know not 
 
         no to let him go.  He needs to know to bring

         him in so that whoever has information about 
 
         him is informed, this person where the red 
 
         lights go off, has been stopped. 
 
			<p>I think a very key part of the design 
 
         of the system is to decide who needs to know

         what about individuals, and who needs to know 
 
         what about events or activities that they need 
 
         to report to others.  There are a lot of ways

         to    you probably get news alerts on your 
 
         e mail all the time.  There are a lot of ways

         to move information around, to alert people to 
 
         things that are developing, or to have people 
 
         understand that they have come across something

         that others need to know about, without having 
 
         to actually inform everyone in the system about

         everything.

			<p>I think that is a very important part 
 
         of the design of the role of all the actors in

         the system.

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  I don't know that there

         is a hard and fast rule that you can apply to 
 
         say something is or is not an encroachment on 
 
         civil liberties that will apply in every 
 
         context.

			<p>Fortunately, the American people are

         not reticent about speaking up on things that 
 
         they think are problems with their own privacy 
 
         and liberty, as well as security interest.

			<p>We all know, those of us, and half of 
 
         this panels that are lawyers by profession, and

         some of the rest of us who are here testifying, 
 
         with every civil liberty, with every civil 
 
         right there is a corresponding obligation.

			<p>We are willing in a reasonable context 
 
         to do things like going through searches of our

         person and our baggage when we go on airplanes 
 
         because we know security risk.  So there are 
 
         things that have to be applied in different

         situations, but I suggest it is a commonsense 
 
         rule.  We simply need to be cognizant of not

         going too far in any context so that we 
 
         encroach on civil liberties, but we are always 
 
         going to be in that balancing act between 
 
         security and civil liberties, and we just need 
 
         to make sure that we try to address as many of

         those as we can in the calm between the storms, 
 
         if you will, so that we are not forced into a 
 
         situation of going overboard, as I said before,

         when the next attack occurs.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Mr. Larsen, you want speak.

			<p>MR. LARSEN:  Yes, sir.  In December I 
 
         met with some folks here in New York City 
 
         Police Department, their intelligence

         organization, and they talked to me about a 
 
         program we need to look at called Advance

         Tip offs.  It is technology that already 
 
         exists, they were asking if they could only 
 
         have the funding to make it work.

			<p>If they would have existed on July 5, 
 
         2001, when the Florida State Trooper pulled

         over Mohamed Atta for speeding, and punched it 
 
         into the National Crime Information Center, it 
 
         would have tied it to 17 different watch lists, 
 
         everybody from Customs, INS, DEA, CIA and 
 
         others.  As Zoe said, It would not say we want

         him for this or whatever, it would just say, 
 
         don't let him go.

			<p>I think the American people would have

         no problem with that.  The technology can 
 
         protect some of the privacy.  But I think

         privacy is going to be one of the most 
 
         important issues you ate going to address.  It should 
 
         be addressed when you have a year to sit down

         and do this.  Not the two weeks that it took to 
 
         pass the Patriot Act, 362 pages that changed 17

         laws.  I haven't had time to read that.  I 
 
         wonder how many members of Congress read it, 
 
         and how difficult it is when it says change

         subparagraph c from "and" to "or."  That would 
 
         take a tremendous amount of work.  I doubt if

         any member of Congress read the entire Patriot 
 
         Act.  That's what this Commission can do.

			<p>I think you also need to look at, what 
 
         are the real standards of privacy in this 
 
         country today.  We hosted a seminar at George

         Washington University, cohosted with the 
 
         Institute in the Elliot School a couple of 
 
         weeks ago, where we looked at law enforcement

         intelligence and one thing, what's the new 
 
         standard?

			<p>One of the professors at George 
 
         Washington recently made a trip to a conference 
 
         in California and as he got to the airport he

         realized he forgot his running shoes, he is a 
 
         big runner.  He said, no problem, I will buy

         some new ones, he had got a lot of miles on 
 
         them.  He checks into the hotel, he goes to the 
 
         store and finds the running shoes that he

         likes, he buys those.  He sees a great pair of 
 
         mens dress shoes on sale, a pretty good price,

         so he buys them.

			<p>Did you ever have it when your credit 
 
         card comes back saying, you're little it bit 
 
         out of the profile, what's your mother's maiden 
 
         name or whatever that is.

			<p>This guy is a computer information 
 
         specialist at George Washington University, so 
 
         he asked the person on the phone, what made it

         pop out of your computer.  He said, three 
 
         things.  First of all, you never bought shoes

         in California, you never bought two pair of 
 
         shoes in one day, and you have never bought 
 
         black dress shoes.

			<p>Now, I am not going to tell you which 
 
         credit card this was, but one of those big

         credit cards knows that about you too.

			<p>Now, that sort of information would 
 
         not be available to the FBI, but it would be to

         your bank card.  What are the standards?  We 
 
         allow the banks to get away with that.  I think

         you need to spend some time with folks in here, 
 
         very seriously talking about new standards of 
 
         privacy. 
 
			<p>We all lived in a small farming 
 
         community where I grew up.  We knew what

         everybody was going because it was a small 
 
         community and we knew everyone.  It is a 
 
         different society we live in now and I think you

         really need to spend some time looking at what 
 
         those standards are.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  Obviously, that is an 
 
         issue that we could go on all afternoon, but 
 
         unfortunately we are short of time.

			<p>I would also like to thank you all for 
 
         your cooperation and for coming here today, and

         the tremendous paperwork that you have provided 
 
         for us, which is going to be first read by 
 
         those people and then by us.  We do appreciate

         it.

			<p>I am afraid we have to get onto really

         some organizational issues which are apparent 
 
         from this topic, but it has been suggested to 
 
         us in various ways that there is no real need 
 
         for additional organization structure, 
 
         especially within the Federal Government.  That

         the authorities that are needed for that exist, 
 
         they are just not fulfilled.  I would 
 
         appreciate each of your comments on that, as an

         initial subject on the organizational side of 
 
         this.

			<p>MR. WERMUTH:  I think we would agree 
 
         in terms of the authority to conduct certain 
 
         activities, as you see will from the written

         testimony in connection with this national 
 
         counter terrorism center which, to a certain

         extent, has some of the characteristics that 
 
         the President's initiative for the terrorist 
 
         threat integration center terms of fusion.

			<p>The research that we did, the 
 
         recommendation that Gilmore Commission made for

         the creation of that center was not to create 
 
         something new in addition to existing 
 
         structures, but to bring pieces of other 
 
         agencies together and put them in the same 
 
         room, if you will, and require them to work

         together collectively, comprehensively, rather 
 
         than working from some distance apart with all 
 
         the culture problems and other barriers that

         exist between and among Federal entities.

			<p>The panel said, take people that are

         already doing this and put them together. 
 
         Don't create something brand new and in 
 
         addition to everything else.  We have got

         statutory authority.  We have got existing 
 
         capability.  We have got expertise in these in

         compartments, but they are simply not together. 
 
         Bring them together.  We happen to say a little 
 
         differently than what the Markle Foundation

         recommendation was.  Don't it put it in 
 
         either Department of Homeland Security or the

         Central Intelligence Agency or any other 
 
         department.  Put it where it is truly 
 
         independent and objective, an honest broker 
 
         because they are a lot of customers.  The 
 
         Department of Homeland Security is not the only

         customer.  The Central Intelligence Agency is 
 
         not the only customer.  The Department of 
 
         Justice is not the only customer.

			<p>Put it in a place where there really 
 
         aren't the inherent pressures, if you will, and

         the competition for resources within an 
 
         existing agency.  Make it free standing, 
 
         objective, independent, but bring all the

         pieces together into that single location. 
 
         That's what we said in a structure standpoint.

			<p>And by the way, we don't need 
 
         additional statutory authority other than 
 
         authority maybe to move the responsibilities

         for those from the agencies where they are into 
 
         this other structure.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  Ms. Baird.

			<p>MS. BAIRD:  Yes, I would just say that 
 
         I think that there is so much to be done to 
 
         build on the existing capabilities and to 
 
         create the activities that need to be

         undertaken, that I would put your focus there 
 
         rather than putting your focus on thinking 
 
         about new laws or new authorities, because

         there is a great deal of capability, legal 
 
         authority, and talent and agency commitment that

         needs to be developed.  That should really be 
 
         the priority.

			<p>I do think that the Department of

         Homeland Security has an important domestic 
 
         role to play, that you can encourage, be played

         out by that department.  It has quite a number 
 
         of agencies in it that have a great deal of 
 
         information that needs to be part of this

         system and that needs to be drawn on by the 
 
         rest of the Government and the locales.

			<p>It also had the potential of being a 
 
         single point of contact for much of the private 
 
         sector information, which is not going to 
 
         comfortably be shared with CIA or foreign 
 
         intelligence community.  So as the Department

         of Homelands Security is ramping up and much of 
 
         the activity that was hoped for by those who 
 
         passed the legislation on Capitol Hill, is

         being pulled into other agencies other than 
 
         Department of Homeland Security or umbrella

         agencies.

			<p>You might look hard at what you would 
 
         encourage the Department of Homeland Security

         to be able to do, and particularly on the 
 
         domestic front, what is important to have

         happened in an agency that is not under the 
 
         direction of the Director of Central 
 
         Intelligence.  What will the American people be

         more comfortable having undertaken and be 
 
         guided by a domestic agency as opposed to a

         foreign intelligence agency.  And I think you 
 
         have seen some of the debates on Capitol Hill, 
 
         much more skittishness about the potential for 
 
         privacy intrusions from the Defense Department 
 
         or the foreign intelligence community, than

         people feel about domestic agencies, and I 
 
         would look hard at that.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  But, of course, the DCI

         exists as a concept.  Is it your feeling that 
 
         that's just not a popular vehicle for doing

         this?

			<p>MS. BAIRD:  I don't think you will 
 
         ever persuade the American people that the

         Director of Central Intelligence is a benign 
 
         entity, because we have operated outside this

         country with rules we will not be comfortable 
 
         applying inside the country, and he has been 
 
         responsible for those operations.

			<p>Perhaps five or ten years from now, 
 
         after the system sorts itself out and people

         understand comfortably how we can use 
 
         information domestically to protect security, 
 
         people with come to that.  But I think that 
 
         will not be a comfortable place to have the 
 
         leadership for domestic intelligence or

         information collection, particularly from the 
 
         private sector.

			<p>MR. LARSEN:  I don't think this new

         organization, that I would like to see, fits 
 
         under the Department of Justice or DCI.  At one

         time I thought it might fit under the new 
 
         Department of Homeland Security, but I am no 
 
         longer sure now.

			<p>Unfortunately, I think what John 
 
         Gannon was trying to do over there got

         derailed.  I think there was some potential 
 
         there.  Clearly the terrorism threat 
 
         intelligence center does not give us what we

         need, and clearly, we cannot have it under law 
 
         enforcement, that is the part I think the

         American people will insist, that we must 
 
         protect the rights of the accused.  So I think 
 
         there are other models we can look at in other 
 
         countries that could perhaps give you some 
 
         vision here.  My final recommendation here was,

         I think you need to start with a blank piece of 
 
         paper.

			<p>The first time I went to visit the

         NAPSI, and I say NAPSI was a wonderful model 
 
         that came out of PDD 39, the previous

         administration, where they fused those things 
 
         together.  But when you first walked in the 
 
         door, the first day I visited there, they

         reached in, they pulled out their badges, they 
 
         were cops.  And they admitted that only 14

         percent of computer crime was reported, because 
 
         businesses didn't want to go to Justice, 
 
         because if you said there has been a computer

         crime and they came out and investigate, 
 
         anything they found out could be used against

         you in a court of law.

			<p>So we are going to have to remove it 
 
         from Justice and, I think, the intelligence 
 
         community.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  That raises a question,

         I guess, I really would like all three of your 
 
         comments too.

			<p>We have obviously had an historic role

         for the FBI, an historic role for the CIA.  One 
 
         was overseas and one was domestic.  And the FBI

         is an adjunct to the Department of Justice.  It 
 
         provides information for the Department of 
 
         Justice, their indictments come down.  Suddenly

         all the information goes into the black hole. 
 
         It can't be shared, it is grand jury

         information, it is law enforcement information, 
 
         but it is being used in the adjudication of 
 
         criminal cases and, therefore, doesn't get

         disseminated.

			<p>How are we going to solve that problem

         in any of these schemes?

			<p>MR. LARSEN:  I think there is a model. 
 
         The national infrastructure protection center 
 
         is being moved to the new department.  They 
 
         looked at all source intelligence information,

         law enforcement sensitive information which 
 
         even included grand jury testimony, and with as 
 
         the vulnerability.  But like I say, once again,

         primarily focussed on cyber aspects of it.

			<p>That model is there. It works.  There

         are certain things that take place in the 
 
         counter terrorism task force that also works. 
 
         I agree, I don't think we need new legislation,

         I think we new need new organization.  I think 
 
         General Eisenhower got it right when he said

         "the right organization will not guarantee 
 
         success, but the wrong organization will 
 
         guarantee failure."

			<p>Now we have the wrong organization. 
 
         We need a new one.

			<p>MR. FIELDING:  Zoe.

			<p>MS. BAIRD:  Well, you have probably 
 
         the leading expert on your own Commission in 
 
         Jamie, on that question.  So I won't even try 
 
         to venture into how information gets shared,

         because she will make sure you are straight there.

			<p>But I would say something that is 
 
         perhaps not responsive, but I think important,

         which is that if much of this information is 
 
         not collected by law enforcement, if

         intelligence information which is intended for 
 
         policy makers is collected through other means, 
 
         or under the direction of the Department of

         Homeland Security, then you don't put the FBI 
 
         in the challenging position of deciding not to

         pursue its own rules.  You then have a policy 
 
         maker who says, okay, this is what we know 
 
         about this group of people.  What policy action

         should be taken?  Do we want to prosecute them 
 
         to get them off the street?  Do we want to

         deport them?  Do we want to continue to follow 
 
         them to see who they are working with outside 
 
         the country, or at other levels or in other 
 
         cells?  Do we want to engage in diplomacy with 
 
         the country from which they came to try and

         learn more about what's going on in that 
 
         country that could lead to a more substantial 
 
         terrorist threat by virtue of the fact that we

         have this information on their citizens, 
 
         perhaps information about relationships between

         their citizens and others.

			<p>So, if you have in the first instance 
 
         the information going to policy makers, then

         the policy makers can decide that this is 
 
         something that should go into that law

         enforcement box.  And how black the box is 
 
         today is a little grayer than it used to be. 
 
         But be as I say, Jamie is the best person to

         inform you about that.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Mr. Wermuth.

			<p>MR. WERMUTH:  Intelligence collection 
 
         for law enforcement purposes investigation, 
 
         arrest and prosecution is, in our view, very 
 
         different than intelligence collection analysis 
 
         and dissemination for deterrents, prevention

         and detection.

			<p>We have said that in our reports, that 
 
         the FBI is the best law enforcement agency in

         the world.  They don't understand intelligence 
 
         collection analysis at the strategic level.

         They do it for law enforcement and it is 
 
         different.  They protect it, as you have 
 
         suggested, in the grand jury testimony and

         investigations.  That is one of the reasons 
 
         this panel said take the FISA collection

         responsibilities out of the FBI and put it into 
 
         this reconstructed, this new design of 
 
         capability in a stand alone center.

			<p>Let me offer an anecdote that I think 
 
         is an analogous.  In a prior    I had something

         to do with counter drug policy making and 
 
         operations.

			<p>In 1990, about this time of year in 
 
         1990, if memory serves, the counter narcotic 
 
         center at the Center Intelligence Agency came

         to the FBI and DEA and said, could we see all 
 
         of your files on Columbian drug 
 
         operations.  Of course, the answer that you

         might expect was, we can't turn over all our 
 
         files to you, there are open investigations,

         there is grand jury testimony in there, we might 
 
         taint evidence that would be presented in a 
 
         court.

			<p>So the CNC went away and scratched 
 
         their heads for a few months and came back and

         said, okay, can we see all of your closed 
 
         files.

			<p>After some agonizing with people in

         the Office of Legal Policies and the Department 
 
         of Justice, and elsewhere within the

         structures, the Bureau and the DEA turned over 
 
         their closed files to the Counter Narcotics 
 
         Center.  Ninety days later the CNC had mapped the 
 
         Cally Cartel to about 95 percent level of 
 
         assurance.

			<p>That is the kind of things we are 
 
         talking about when we talk about strategic 
 
         intelligence versus intelligence for law

         enforcements.  It is different situation, and 
 
         this panel has said that they are not sure that

         the FBI would ever be able to change their 
 
         culture to understand the difference in the 
 
         two.  And even if they could, it would take new

         generation of FBI agents and leadership, 
 
         despite all the great things that Director

         Muller and some of the senior people in the FBI 
 
         are trying to do.

			<p>It is an inherent culture in that

         organization that they do things for law 
 
         enforcement purposes.  They don't do it for

         strategic purposes, for deterrents, prevention 
 
         and protection.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  We will take five more 
 
         minutes.

			<p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  With respect to

         comment that Ms. Baird made in her written 
 
         materials relating to agencies rushing out to 
 
         collect information and technology on their

         own, resulting in stove piping of systems.  We 
 
         have seen the unfortunately named Total

         Information Assessment Office recently 
 
         defunded.  Undoubtedly, throughout the 
 
         Government, since there is this great infusion

         of funds thrown at counter terrorism, what have 
 
         you observed in terms of duplication of

         efforts, duplication of funding, which perhaps 
 
         we, in being on the scene and in realtime, 
 
         observers of situation can perhaps influence in

         some way.  And if we could, what would you have 
 
         us do?

			<p>MS. BAIRD:  A great deal of funding is 
 
         being put into the information collection 
 
         capability for the government, but it is being 
 
         put into filling up the stove pipes, by and 
 
         large.  It is not being put into developing a

         system of sharing information and at the 
 
         federal, state and local level.  So very little 
 
         money is going into the intersection between

         agencies or between the federal and local, and 
 
         having the state and local governments fail to

         be able to be part of the system.

			<p>I would encourage you to look at, and 
 
         to ask people to provide you with information

         about the dollars that are going to developing 
 
         the systems of sharing and integration of a

         national system as opposed to filling the stove 
 
         pipes of particular federal agencies.

			<p>MR. WERMUTH:  I am trying to find the

         exact cite that the National Strategy for 
 
         Homeland Security talked about the creation of

         something that it call it a Collaborative 
 
         Classified Enterprise, and that was supposed to 
 
         be exactly the kind of stuff that Zoe was 
 
         talking about, to link all of this together for 
 
         both intelligence and information sharing so

         that you could get information to the people 
 
         who needed to have it, at the right time, at 
 
         the right place.  You could bring information

         that was gathered in appropriate ways, into 
 
         this collaborative classified enterprise, was

         what the national strategy called it.

			<p>We suggested that be in this new 
 
         national counter terrorism center that the

         panel called for.  It wouldn't have to be 
 
         there, but it certainly needs to be, as Zoe

         said, a comprehensive focused prioritized 
 
         mechanism for doing exactly what she was 
 
         suggesting.

			<p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  I approach this with 
 
         no preconception, but one of the things that we

         have heard a lot about and will continue to 
 
         study, is the question of whether this domestic 
 
         intelligence collection enterprise is moved out 
 
         of the FBI, where it basically now resides, and 
 
         put somewhere else.

			<p>Two things:  One, you have this great 
 
         aircraft carrier of the FBI turning.  We are in 
 
         the process of turning.  They have devoted

         assets, they have re-trained.  They are trying 
 
         to do what we are asking them to do.

			<p>At the same time there are discussion 
 
         that we should go to something like a British 
 
         MI5 or the Canadian bifurcation or the French,

     God forbid, or something 
 
         else.

			<p>Is there a suggestion from your 
 
         collective experience as to one country which 
 
         would be a model, in a democratic country,

         which operates in an efficient way that should 
 
         be a model, at least in part, for us.

			<p>MR. LARSEN:  We looked at MI5 very 
 
         closely, for example.  But we deliberately 
 
         stayed away from trying to draw a comparison 
 
         with what this panel was recommending with the 
 
         national counter terrorism center, including

         the domestic collection piece and MI5.

			<p>The simple fact is, the laws are 
 
         different.  The concerns about civil liberties

         are different.  The concerns about privacy are 
 
         different.  You might compare some structure

         just in terms of where it is located, who it 
 
         reports to it, and who can task it and what 
 
         some of the limitations are.

			<p>We finally came to the conclusion that 
 
         there wouldn't be anything advantageous from

         making those comparatives because so many 
 
         things are different.  This panel said this is 
 
         a U.S. problem, we need a U.S. solution, and

         that's why it recommended what it did, without 
 
         any artifical or arbitrary comparisons to the

         structures in other countries.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  We have a couple of 
 
         minutes.  We have three commissioners who have 
 
         been waiting to ask questions; Senator Gorton, 
 
         Commissioner Gorelick and Senator Cleland.

         Fast questions and answers, if we can.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  Mine would take far too 
 
         long, so I will defer    I couldn't even ask

         the question in the time.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  We all want to hear

         that question at some point.

			<p>MR. GORTON:  You will.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  First let me say to Zoe

         Baird and to the Markle Foundation, thank you 
 
         for directing our attention to, A, the low

         hanging fruit of engaging state and local 
 
         government agencies and corporate America, and 
 
         for teeing up the very important question of

         the balance between privacy and the efficacy of 
 
         law enforcement and counter terrorism.

			<p>My questions are primarily directed to 
 
         Mr. Wermuth and Mr. Larsen.  They go to the 
 
         question of efficacy of commissions. 
 
			<p>Mr. Wermuth, I would have thought that 
 
         if you read your commission recommendations,

         together with the conclusions of the joint 
 
         inquiry which just, after all, looked at 
 
         intelligence failures, but nevertheless, that

         it would have been sickening to you because you 
 
         recommended, well before September 11, 2001,

         that we have a fusion of intelligence, law 
 
         enforcement, immigration information, and that 
 
         we engage fully state and local law

         enforcement.  And when you put that together 
 
         with what the joint inquiry said would have

         occurred in terms of the apprehension of 
 
         leadership of those who perpetrated 9/11, that 
 
         if you had gotten that information together you

         could have apprehended those people, or 
 
         possibly you could have.

			<p>It is a very disturbing picture.  And 
 
         here we are, ten commissioners, a very able 
 
         staff, very able people willing to help us, and 
 
         my question to you as we are in this first 
 
         public hearing, looking to the end of our

         process is, do you have any second thoughts 
 
         about what you did with your recommendation? 
 
         Are there things that we can learn about how to

         be more effective and have greater impact, so 
 
         that the scenario I just described wouldn't be

         repeated in the future?

			<p>MR. WOLOSKY:  It certainly is 
 
         frustrating when you look at this from an

         historical context now, to realize how many, 
 
         what now appeared to be pressing

         recommendations this panel made before 
 
         September of 2001.  But you have served in  a 
 
         major department of government and the highest

         levels.  Others of you have, others have served 
 
         in Congress and as chief executives of states.

         You know the tensions that exist.  You know the 
 
         parochial nature of certain issues that exist. 
 
         You know the politics, both with a little P and 
 
         a big P that often enter into deliberations of 
 
         legislative bodies and Executive Branch

         agencies.

			<p>That is not to say that any of that 
 
         was not well intentioned at the time.  Our

         agencies do compete with each other.  Our 
 
         political parties compete with each other.

         Heavens, the two Houses of Congress compete 
 
         with each other.

			<p>I think there is significant value in

         commissions just like the one on which you now 
 
         sit because you bring a wealth of information

         to the discussion without the constraints, 
 
         maybe, that you once had when you served within 
 
         a specific branch of government or represented

         a party in a particular house of Congress.

			<p>You will be able, from what we have

         learned, you will be able to be more open and 
 
         honest and comprehensive, and nonpartisan in a 
 
         capacity like this, than perhaps you were in 
 
         positions in which you served in the past.

			<p>To us that's beneficial.  That is not

         to say that you need to establish a national 
 
         commission for every single problem and expect 
 
         it to solve the problems, but you can have some

         impact.  Of the 79 recommendations that our 
 
         advisory panel made in its first three reports,

         66 of them have been adopted in whole or in 
 
         major part.  So you can have an impact.  That 
 
         doesn't mean that you will get all of the

         things right, but if you are a panel that is 
 
         composed of the kind of people that are clearly

         on this panel, with your expertise and national 
 
         recognition.  Suffice it to say that, your 
 
         recommendations and I dare say they will be

         reasonable and logical and sound and supported 
 
         by the evidence and everything else, you will

         have an impact.  You shouldn't be concerned 
 
         about that.

			<p>The only concern would be, can you do 
 
         it fast enough to get them into play before the 
 
         next events happen.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  Thank you.  I would 
 
         like to hear any comments from Mr. Larsen and 
 
         Ms. Baird.

			<p>MR. LARSEN:  I don't often disagree 
 
         with Michael.  I disagree a little bit.  We had

         a close mutual friend, Philip Coleman, when he 
 
         sat down to be the director on the Presidential 
 
         Commission on Critical Infrastructure and

         Protection.  He went back and looked at a whole 
 
         bunch of commissions and what effect did they

         really have.  It is pretty discouraging when 
 
         you really look at the data out there.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  Well, he also, his

         commission, the Presidential Commission on 
 
         Critical Infrastructure catalogued all of the

         vulnerabilities of each of the sectors in this 
 
         report, and one questions what has happened to all 
 
         that information, and is it being used. 
 
			<p>MR. LARSEN:  A very good question.  I 
 
         know NAPSI was very focussed in cyber owning

         and the physical dropped off the scope.

			<p>But I tell you in January    a 
 
         recommendation I have for you how to get better

         action out of your report.  You don't want it 
 
         to become shelfware, like so many do, okay,

         another report, let's stick it over there.

			<p>In January of 2001, Dr. Tara O'Toole 
 
         from Johns Hopkins and I, were terribly

         concerned about this country being vulnerable 
 
         to an attack of smallpox.  Something we know

         that Iraq has, that could threaten the survival 
 
         of the nation.

			<p>Now, we could have gotten a small

         study funded by the Markle Foundation or 
 
         someone, and gone out and written a report and

         put it up there and what would it have done? 
 
         What we did together was put together that 
 
         exercise, Dark Winter, and then not so much the 
 
         exercise, but how we took that 35 minute 
 
         presentation in a dramatic format, and sat down

         with Senator Warner in his office with Senator 
 
         Roberts, with Vice President Cheney.  We 
 
         briefed Vice President Cheney nine days after

         9/11 and said this is what it means to this 
 
         country only having 15 million doses of smallpox

         vaccine.  I accept that is very focused, one 
 
         small issue.  We got a $500 million program out 
 
         of that and the country is far more secure.

			<p>There is another commission going on 
 
         right now looking at another threat and has

         come to us and said, could you do a Dark Winter 
 
         style thing for us to help us when we finish 
 
         our study and our scientific work, to put it

         together so we can take it around town and sit 
 
         down either in Congressional hearings or

         one on one with senior leaders and say, let us 
 
         show you what it would be like if we have 
 
         another serious threat coming to our country 
 
         with the system we have now.  Let us show you 
 
         what it would be like if we had this new system

         we recommend.

			<p>A dramatic 30 minute presentation like 
 
         that, is something that might help you market

         your recommendations.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  Zoe, do you want to have the

         last word on that question?

			<p>MS. BAIRD:  No.  I think enough has 
 
         been said. Thank you.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Last question from Senator 
 
         Cleland.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  Thank you very much, Mr. 
 
         Chairman.  Just one quick one.  We may be 
 
         getting lost in the weeds here, for the second

         day in a row here, I have heard distinguished 
 
         panelists say there is going to be another

         attack.  Mr. Larsen, you said that, the 
 
         gentleman here and Ms. Baird.  We heard that 
 
         yesterday from an expert on terrorism, who has 
 
         been studying that since 1974, I think.

			<p>That's very scary.  Given the fact

         that what little we know about Osama bin Laden, 
 
         and we haven't found him yet apparently, is 
 
         that he generates his energy from the

         allegation that particularly America is overstepping 
 
         its bounds and has a footprint on

         Islamic lands in Egypt, in Saudi Arabia and now 
 
         we have a war in Iraq.  I mean, are these aid 
 
         to Egypt, aid to and a base in Saudi Arabia,

         the war in Iraq.  Are these actions by the 
 
         United States more likely to produce the

         counterattack or this next attack, Mr. Larsen?

			<p>What elements are there that make you 
 
         think we are going to get hit again, and what

         would lessen those elements?

			<p>MR. LARSEN:  The fact that we are at

         war in Iraq today, in my mind, there is no 
 
         question that it increases the threat of 
 
         attacks on our homeland in the short term. 
 
			<p>However, if we are we were not at war 
 
         in Iraq today and Saddam refused to disarm, I

         think the long term, the threat would be even 
 
         be more significant.  We're not at war today in 
 
         Iraq to make it safer this week or this month.

         I think it is trying to make a safer 
 
         internationally security environment for my

         children and your children and grandchildren. 
 
         That is what it is.

			<p>The international security equation

         has changed, as I said in the beginning, with 
 
         technology, small actors can seriously threaten

         us.  It is not just Osama bin Ladin, it is 
 
         others, but you mentioned Osama bin Ladin.  He 
 
         doesn't hate us for what we do in our foreign

         policy, I think, as much as and what we are 
 
         and what we believe in in this country.  That's

         not going to change.  So I think we have to 
 
         understand it.  I hate saying that.  I hate 
 
         saying that to my kids and grandkids down in 
 
         Texas that there are going to be more attacks, 
 
         but it is a fact that we have to adjust to.

         It is going to happen.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  Anyone else, Mr. 
 
         Wermuth.

			<p>MR. WERMUTH:  I happen to think that 
 
         whether we were in Iraq or not    we said this

         clearly, even before the current conflict 
 
         started that the likelihood, for the for all 
 
         the reasons that Randy has mentioned, there are

         people out there and not just Osama bin Laden, 
 
         there are just people out there who don't like

         us.  And are likely now because the mold has 
 
         been broken, and we have had significant 
 
         terrorist attacks inside the United States,

         that others will be emboldened to do it.

			<p>But I  mean, let's face it, we had

         what could have been a disastrous attack right 
 
         down the street in 1993 and a lot of people 
 
         said you better be paying attention to that.  
 
         You need to understand what implications that 
 
         has for the future, and some people listened

         but not enough people listened.

			<p>The operations in Iraq may do as 
 
         someone said yesterday, create another hundred

         Osama bin Ladens, but I would suggest that any 
 
         number of policies of this country, just

         because we do what we do, we are who we are, 
 
         might just as well push some of those people 
 
         over the edge into attacking us at some point

         in time.

			<p>So I don't think that this country can

         stop taking decisive action when it is in the 
 
         U.S. national interest to do that, as long as 
 
         we have good grounds to do it.  Whatever it

         is, whether it is economic policy or military 
 
         engagement or types of diplomacy or sanctions

         or whatever else it happens to be, just because 
 
         we are scared of the next terrorist attack.

			<p>And I know Senator, that is not what 
 
         you were suggesting.  I think we, 
 
         obviously, have to take into consideration what

         reactions our actions may cause in other parts 
 
         of the world and within other cultures, but we 
 
         still need to continue to try to do the right

         thing wherever we interest in the world.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you very, very much. 
 
         It has been a wonderful panel.  Thank you so 
 
         much for your help and for your past work, and

         hopefully we can call on you as we go along in 
 
         the future.

			<p>Thank you all very much.  We will try 
 
         to get back, if we can, a 35 minute recess, if 
 
         we can do that.

			<p>(Recess.)

			<p>MR. KEAN:  The Commissioner of Police

         and the Commissioner of Fire.  They were here 
 
         yesterday and have promised future cooperation 
 
         with the Commission. 
 
			<p>We have also got a statement to be 
 
         read into the record by Senator Corzine.

         Senator Corzine has been very interested in the 
 
         Commission and very helpful to the Commission 
 
         at this point, and he had a statement which we

         will read into the record.

			<p>Today's panel starts now and will end

         at 3:00.  We have Shawn Kelley, who is in the 
 
         Arlington County Fire Department.  I appreciate 
 
         your being here.  William Baker, of the American

         Society of Civil Engineers, and Ken Holden from 
 
         New York Department of Design and Construction.

         I thank you all for being here.

			<p>Mr. Kelley, would you like to start.

			<p>MR. KELLEY:  Good afternoon.  My name

         is Shawn Kelly and I am Assistant Chief with 
 
         Arlington County Fire Department and was one of

         the incident commanders throughout the rescue 
 
         and recovery efforts at the Pentagon.

			<p>On behalf of the Arlington County 
 
         Government and the men and women of the fire 
 
         services in Northern Virginia and the Washington

         D.C. area, thank you for allowing me to address 
 
         you today.

			<p>Like most fire departments in the

         region, the Arlington County Fire Department 
 
         participated in regional disaster drills

         consisting of hospital or college dorm fires, 
 
         mass transportation accidents and even 
 
         structural collapses. But never did we think of

         training for an incident that combined an 
 
         airliner crash into a large building,

         structural collapse, along with large building 
 
         fire that was fuelled by jet fuel.

			<p>Following the March 1995 sarin nerve

         agent attack in a Tokyo subway that killed 
 
         twelve commuters and injured hundreds more, the

         Arlington County Fire Department recognized 
 
         that America's first responders were not 
 
         trained or equipped to handle such emergency.  
 
         Our training changed its focus towards large 
 
         scale incident management.

			<p>From the moment American Airlines 
 
         flight 77 crashed into the west side of the 
 
         Pentagon at 0938 a.m. and for the subsequent

         ten days, this was a major fire and rescue 
 
         incident, the responsibility of the Arlington

         County Fire Department.

			<p>The destruction caused by the attack 
 
         was immediate and catastrophic.  The 270,000

         pounds of metal and jet fuel hurling into the 
 
         solid mass of Pentagon is the equivalent in

         weight to a diesel train locomotive, except it 
 
         is travelling at more than 400 miles per hour. 
 
         More than 600,000 airframe bolts and rivets,

         and 60 miles of wire were instantly transformed 
 
         into white hot shrapnel.

			<p>The resulting impact, penetration and 
 
         burning fuel had catastrophic effects on five 
 
         floors and three rings on the Pentagon 
 
         corridors numbers 4 and 5.

			<p>This act of evil cost the lives of 198

         persons in the Pentagon attack; 194 were innocent 
 
         victims and 5 terrorist perpetrators of this 
 
         criminal act.

			<p>Though the Arlington County Fire 
 
         Department did not feel its response to

         terrorist attack on the Pentagon was 
 
         extraordinary, it did not happen by chance. 
 
         The Arlington County Fire Department's

         preparedness was a result of years or hard 
 
         work, reorganization, intensive contemporary

         training and updating command staff education.

			<p>The successful response to the 
 
         terrorist attack on the Pentagon can be

         attributed to effects of ordinary men and women 
 
         performing in extraordinary fashion.  These

         efforts are described through an after action 
 
         report that was prepared for the Arlington 
 
         County by Titan Systems Corporation. 
 
			<p>It was accomplished through a grant 
 
         from and support of the Department of Justice,

         Office of Justice Programs, Office of Domestic 
 
         Preparedness.

			<p>The After Action Report describes the

         activities of Arlington County and the 
 
         supporting jurisdictions, government agencies

         and other organizations in response to the 
 
         September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the 
 
         Pentagon.

			<p>It is organized into four principal 
 
         annexes and four supporting annexes.  Annex A

         is fire department operations and emergency 
 
         medical service activities, and it is the bulk 
 
         of the report.

			<p>Annex B is about the response of the 
 
         local area hospitals and clinics and their

         ability to handle communications and the number 
 
         of patients that could have been brought to 
 
         them. 
 
			<p>Annex C covers local, federal and 
 
         private law enforcement agencies.

			<p>And Annex D is the emergency 
 
         management and emergency operation center that 
 
         supported the first responders and citizens or

         Arlington County.

			<p>You will see on September 12,

         Arlington County public schools were open and 
 
         trash was picked up and services continued in 
 
         that jurisdiction.

			<p>Although the response to the September 
 
         11, 2001, terrorist attack is commendable, the

         After Action Report contains 235 recommendation 
 
         and lessons learned.  Each which must be 
 
         understood within the context and setting of

         the Pentagon response.

			<p>The first segment describes

         capabilities others should emulate and speaks 
 
         to incident command system and the unified 
 
         command that was established at this event.  
 
         Mutual aid with surrounding and supporting 
 
         jurisdictions and outside support, and the

         Arlington County emergency management plan that 
 
         was put into place, the Employee Assistance 
 
         Program, the training that we had undergone,

         exercises that we had performed and shared 
 
         experiences.

			<p>The final segment describes challenges 
 
         that must be met and speaks to self 
 
         dispatching, fixed and mobile command and

         control facilities, communications, logistics 
 
         and hospital coordination.

			<p>The Arlington County Fire Department 
 
         is addressing these challenges by updating its 
 
         communications system, the purchase of a

         dedicated command vehicle, establishment of 
 
         a logistic segment within the department, and

         ongoing coordination with local and regional 
 
         hospitals.

			<p>In summary, the response to 2001 
 
         terrorist attack on the Pentagon was successful 
 
         by any measure.  Although the tragic loss of

         life from this horrific event could not be 
 
         avoided, it was minimized.  Had it not been for 
 
         the heroic actions from the response force and

         the military and civilian occupants of the 
 
         Pentagon, clearly the number of casualties could

         have been much higher.

			<p>Damage, although severe, was contained 
 
         in area and the fire was brought quickly under

         control.  The fact that the response force did 
 
         not suffer a single fatality or serious injury,

         is testimony to the training, professionalism 
 
         and leadership of the Arlington County and the 
 
         response community.

			<p>Terrorism, in any manifestation, is an 
 
         insidious phenomenon.  It strikes without

         warning, often targeting innocent people.  It 
 
         is not intended to defeat an enemy by 
 
         overwhelming military force, but to undermine 
 
         and weaken its resolve.  If the terrorist 
 
         intended to weaken our resolve by attacking the

         Pentagon, they failed.

			<p>In the words of our County Manager, 
 
         Ron Carlee, "The cowardly and evil effort to

         terrorize our community and our country served 
 
         only to unite us more strongly than ever

         before."

			<p>Thank you.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you very much.

			<p>Mr. Baker.

			<p>MR. BAKER:  Yes, my name is Bill Baker

         and I am the partner in charge of structural 
 
         engineering in Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.  I 
 
         am here today representing the American Society

         of Civil Engineers.

			<p>I wish to express my sincere

         appreciation for being asked to address the 
 
         Commission on behalf of the ASCE/FEMA World 
 
         Trade Center Building Performance Assessment 
 
         Team.

			<p>My comments relate to my role on the

         ASCE/FEMA team as well as my experiences as a 
 
         structural engineer assisting the fire fighters 
 
         and contractors in the early days after the

         attack on the World Trade Center.

			<p>In addition, I will offer my

         recommendations as to what may be valuable to New 
 
         York and other urban areas in dealing with the 
 
         aftermath of future terrorist attacks.  These

         recommendations include: immediate coordination 
 
         of on site contractors and structural

         engineers; an archived depository for 
 
         construction drawings of all city wide 
 
         buildings and infrastructure; and federal

         "good Samaritan" legislation for those 
 
         assisting.

			<p>When I arrived at the World Trade 
 
         Center site after the attack, I was awestruck 
 
         at the extent of the devastation.  While the 
 
         media focused on the destruction of the twin 
 
         towers, the damage went far beyond anything

         that was conveyed to the general public.  The 
 
         damage included the total collapse of four 
 
         major buildings, the partial collapse and

         burnout of three major buildings and extensive 
 
         damage to seven additional buildings.  Many

         other buildings suffered minor damage.  The 
 
         district's infrastructure, including utilities 
 
         and the subway system in the area, was

         extensively damaged and parts of it were 
 
         destroyed.

			<p>The New York City Department of Design 
 
         and Construction performed a brilliant job in 
 
         organizing the efforts of the engineering and

         construction industries to support the search 
 
         and rescue and, later, clean up of the site.  The

         DDC divided the district into four sectors. 
 
         Each sector was assigned to a team of 
 
         contractors.  This was a very successful 
 
         approach.

			<p>Because the contractors were top notch

         and adept at managing very large private and 
 
         public sector projects, they knew how to 
 
         organize the teams, deal with heavy equipment

         and marshal resources.  However, the 
 
         contractors needed the professional assistance

         of structural engineers.

			<p>The Structural Engineering Association 
 
         of New York stepped forward to organize the

         services of structural engineers from across 
 
         the city, state and country.  SEAoNY, as it is

         called, assembled teams of structural engineers 
 
         to assist each of the four contractor teams.  I 
 
         urge the Commission to use this approach

         developed by the DDC and SEAoNY as a model for 
 
         dealing with possible large urban disasters.

         In many ways, New York City was a fortunate to 
 
         have the DDC and major players from the 
 
         engineering and construction industries 
 
         available to assist at the site.

			<p>In the first critical hours and days

         following the attack, what was not readily 
 
         available or well organized were drawings 
 
         of the buildings, plazas, subway tunnels,

         freight tunnels, et cetera.  As engineers and 
 
         contractors were investigating the extent and

         severity of damage, drawings of the original 
 
         structure were sorely needed.  When it was 
 
         necessary to bring in large cranes across

         subway tunnels, vaults and plazas, drawings 
 
         were an absolute necessity.  I strongly urge

         all major cities to develop an archive 
 
         depository for construction drawings and other 
 
         critical information to be available to the

         authorities on short notice.  A duplicate copy 
 
         should be housed in a redundant location.

			<p>The structural engineers who assisted 
 
         at the World Trade Center site were often in 
 
         uncharted territory with respect to 
 
         professional liability.  There should be 
 
         appropriate national "Good Samaritan"

         legislation to promote the assistance of 
 
         engineers in such situations.  While such 
 
         legislation exists in high seismic states such

         as California and some of the West Coast 
 
         states, all states are vulnerable to terrorist

         attacks and there should be appropriate 
 
         legislation.

			<p>At this point, I would like to focus

         my comments on the efforts of the ASCE/FEMA 
 
         Building Assessment.  The Structural

         Engineering Institute, a division of the 
 
         American Society of Civil Engineers, was 
 
         responsible for organizing this effort and

         bringing together the relevant professional 
 
         societies with support of FEMA, for an

         assessment of the World Trade Center site. 
 
         Under the leadership of ASCE, a team of 
 
         structural engineers and fire engineering 
 
         experts from around the country were brought 
 
         together.  Because of my expertise in designing tall

         buildings, I was asked to join the effort and 
 
         be on the five member core group that directed 
 
         the assessment.

			<p>This type of effort is important 
 
         because the advancement of construction of

         buildings has often come from the analysis of 
 
         failures.  These tragic events of 9/11 provided 
 
         an opportunity to see how building emergency

         systems and structural systems behave in 
 
         extraordinary events.  Although the media has

         focused on the twin towers, there is more to be 
 
         learned from the ordinary buildings that were 
 
         damaged by the events.  We saw and documented

         the performance of structures that resisted 
 
         extraordinary forces and maintained their

         overall integrity.  But we also saw and documented 
 
         collapses that, based on previous experiences, 
 
         should not have happened.  It is through the 
 
         study of these behaviors that the art of 
 
         building design is advanced.

			<p>Unfortunately, the ASCE/FEMA team 
 
         faced many obstacles while studying the World 
 
         Trade Center.  The team was not able to

         assemble on the site until October 6th.  We 
 
         could only request and cajole to get drawings

         and other information.  In fact, we did not 
 
         receive access to the twin tower drawings until 
 
         January.  Nonetheless, the team was able to

         perform an invaluable service in our initial, 
 
         overall evaluation of the buildings in order to

         focus and prioritize future investigations and 
 
         research.

			<p>In response to this, fortunately, the

         National Construction Safety Act that was 
 
         signed into law on October 1, 2002 addresses

         many of the difficulties faced by the ASCE/FEMA team at 
 
         the World Trade Center site.  This act 
 
         authorizes the National Institute of Standards 
 
         and Technology to investigate building 
 
         failures.  This is similar to the National

         Transportation Safety Board investigations of 
 
         airlines and other transportation accidents.

			<p>This allows NIST teams access to

         building failure sites; provides the power to 
 
         subpoena evidence; provides access to drawings,

         records and other documents; and allows for the 
 
         removal and storage of evidence.  None of this 
 
         was available to the ASCE team.

			<p>This legislation is a significant step 
 
         forward in creating a vehicle by which the

         design and construction industry can learn from 
 
         failures.  This will help to advance building 
 
         technology and improve the safety and

         reliability of future construction.

			<p>As a structural engineer, the World

         Trade Center collapse represents the largest 
 
         structural failure in the history of mankind. 
 
         From this tragedy, I am confident that we can 
 
         learn now to approach catastrophic building 
 
         failures in the future and through the National

         Construction Safety Act we will continue to 
 
         learn how to improve building construction.

			<p>Thank you for your attention.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you.  Mr. Holden.

			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  Good afternoon Chairman

         Kean, Vice Chair Hamilton and members of the 
 
         Commission.  My name is Kenneth Holden and I am 
 
         the Commissioner of the New York City

         Department of Design and Construction.  Thank 
 
         you for allowing me to appear in front of you

         today.

			<p>The City's Department of Design and 
 
         Construction, DDC, was created by the Mayor in

         1996 to consolidate most of the City's capital 
 
         construction programs.  Its mission is to

         streamline the design and construction of the 
 
         City's infrastructure and facilities by 
 
         ensuring that the City's projects are delivered 
 
         in a safe, timely, and cost effective manner.

			<p>DDC's clients include OEM, the Police,

         Fire, Environmental Protection, Transportation, 
 
         Aging, Juvenile Justice, Correction, Health and 
 
         Cultural Affairs Departments; the

         Administration for Children's Services; the 
 
         Human Resources Administration; the Public

         Library System and the Board of Education.

			<p>On the morning of September 11, 2001, 
 
         I was preparing to leave my office in Long

         Island City for a meeting at City Hall when I 
 
         first learned that a plane had hit the World

         Trade Center.  I immediately went into downtown 
 
         Manhattan, and was on the steps of City Hall 
 
         when the first tower collapsed.  I, along with

         many others that day, ran north.  Eventually, 
 
         around 11:00 that morning I ended up at One

         Police Plaza, which was being set up as a 
 
         command center.  It was there that DDC's role 
 
         began. 
 
			<p>We realized that the entire 
 
         infrastructure of the Port Authority, which was

         headquartered in the North Tower and is the 
 
         owner of the site, had been decimated, and 
 
         therefore a response from them was likely

         impossible.  FEMA and the Army Corps of 
 
         Engineers had not arrived yet.  I thus began

         trying to get contractors and structural 
 
         engineers to the site to conduct a 
 
         walk through, in order to assess the stability

         of the site and the scope of the response that 
 
         was required.  DDC was uniquely qualified to

         jump into action in this emergency: We had many 
 
         construction project mangers and engineers on 
 
         staff with significant and varied experience

         and we had established numerous contacts with 
 
         experienced firms that could immediately

         mobilize the equipment and personnel necessary 
 
         to help with the search and rescue operation. 
 
         Our ability to draw on our own internal 
 
         expertise and these widespread outside contacts 
 
         allowed for the quick and efficient

         decision making this situation required.

			<p>At approximately 5:00 that evening, I 
 
         conducted a walk through with several engineers

         and construction managers.  The immediate need 
 
         was for lighting, since all electricity was

         out.  I spent Tuesday night and Wednesday in a 
 
         mad scramble to locate light towers to 
 
         illuminate the site, and also to bring in heavy

         equipment to lift debris, so that fire fighters 
 
         could fight fires, and the search and rescue

         operations could go on.  We worked closely with 
 
         the Police Department to set up police escorts 
 
         to get the contractors over the bridges.

			<p>DDC staff was pulled from their 
 
         regular duties to organize and manage

         demolition, excavation and debris removal 
 
         operations.  Many worked 18 hour days, seven 
 
         days a week, to respond to the emergency. 
 
			<p>In the first days, I recall being 
 
         stunned by rescue efforts to lift and demolish

         the north pedestrian bridge with many fire 
 
         trucks underneath, and wondering if there were 
 
         any survivors.  I watched a priest praying over

         the smoldering remains of Building 7, and ran 
 
         into a contractor and cried on his shoulder.

         However, I could not allow myself much time to 
 
         feel, because we assumed there were survivors 
 
         in the piles of debris and we had to come up

         with a plan to get them out.

			<p>Using emergency procurement

         procedures, four construction companies were 
 
         hired on a "time and material"  basis.  Those 
 
         firms hired numerous subcontractors for

         scaffolding and netting, demolition, health and 
 
         safety planning and monitoring, hazardous

         materials removal, shoring, structural 
 
         engineering, hauling and barging.

			<p>In cooperation with the Port 
 
         Authority, the Fire Department, Police 
 
         Department and numerous other agencies, DDC

         handled hundreds of details and questions every 
 
         hour.  The site was immediately and immensely 
 
         hazardous for rescue and clean up workers.  We

         divided the site into quadrants and placed 
 
         netting on surrounding buildings, to secure the

         site for the rescue effort.  We came up with a 
 
         Site Safety Plan to address hazards throughout 
 
         the site, from cranes dangling ironworkers in

         baskets facing precariously leaning pieces of 
 
         the towers, to voids in the debris that could

         swallow a grappler.

			<p>Just walking on the site was hazardous 
 
         because the debris could shift at any moment.

         Yet hundreds of fire fighters, police officers, 
 
         rescue workers, laborers, crane operators, iron

         workers, construction management personnel and 
 
         DDC staffers worked around the clock in close 
 
         proximity to literally hundreds of potentially 
 
         dangerous objects and situations.  Throughout 
 
         this time, the war like atmosphere was surreal,

         with Army, National Guard and NYPD providing 
 
         armed security.

			<p>Quick, but safe decisions regarding

         where to put the cranes had to be made, 
 
         inspection of the slurry wall and water in the

         basement were conducted, while numerous fires 
 
         were still burning and smoldering.  Underground, 
 
         it was still so hot that molten metal dripped

         down the sides of the wall from Building 6. 
 
         Cars both burned and pristine, were suspended

         in the air balanced on cracked parking garage 
 
         slabs.

			<p>Along with the Building Department and

         Structural Engineers Association of New York, 
 
         DDC assessed 400 buildings in the surrounding

         area for structural integrity.  Over 200 
 
         engineers worked, above and below ground, to 
 
         monitor the structural integrity of the 
 
         buildings that surrounded the World Trade 
 
         Center complex, to ensure that the debris pile

         remained stable during debris removal and to 
 
         monitor the stability of the slurry wall.

			<p>There was constant inter agency

         coordination, and daily meetings were held, 
 
         which included many Federal, State and City

         agencies.

			<p>Government agencies brushed aside 
 
         their normal bureaucratic tendencies and

         effectively said to one another, "What can we 
 
         do to help?"  Although FEMA and the Army Corps

         of Engineers usually take over disaster sites, 
 
         to their credit, they recognized that DDC had 
 
         pulled together an effective team of the best

         and brightest, so instead they worked with us. 
 
         They told the City to continue its work and

         they guided us to make sure we were doing the 
 
         work in a manner that would allow FEMA to 
 
         reimburse us.  They allowed us to use "time and 
 
         materials"  contracts, which they do not 
 
         normally allow.

			<p>Police officers, fire fighters and 
 
         Port Authority Police officers spent countless 
 
         hours searching for survivors and remains.  DOT

         re routed traffic, the Mayor's Community 
 
         Affairs unit set up a family assistance center

         and consoled families of victims, the Fire 
 
         Department put out the fires, the National Guard 
 
         and Police Department provided security.  The

         Department of Sanitation cleaned the site and 
 
         watered down the streets, and OEM mobilized

         command centers at the Police Academy and Pier 
 
         92 from which it supplied the coordination and 
 
         organizational focus necessary to complete a

         job of this magnitude and complexity.

			<p>Throughout the operation, finding

         survivors, and then later human remains, was 
 
         always a priority.  But to do that we had to be 
 
         able to remove the debris and steel.  
 
         Cooperation between Federal, State and City 
 
         agencies was especially crucial in setting up

         bargaining operations at Piers 25 and 6, to 
 
         handle the staggering amount of steel and other 
 
         debris that had to be removed from the site.

         The Fresh Kills Landfill, which was closed, was 
 
         re opened and mobilized to accept the steel and

         debris from the site.  Steel and debris from 
 
         the site was sent to Fresh Kills where it was 
 
         examined and sifted.  As the Department of

         Sanitation could no longer handle the steel 
 
         with their existing equipment, and our

         engineers thought the steel would destabilize 
 
         the landfill, DDC received verbal permission to 
 
         ship the steel to New Jersey.  By the end of

         June 2002, an astounding total of over 1.6 
 
         million tons of steel and other debris were

         removed from the site.

			<p>As the site became more a 
 
         reconstruction area, infrastructure 
 
         coordination was required to handle numerous 
 
         concerns, including massive amounts of conduit

         in the streets; sewer, water main and street 
 
         repair; reducing the perimeter to allow 
 
         businesses and residents to return;

         establishing roads in the World Trade Center 
 
         complex; fewer cranes, more grapplers;

         continued focus on site safety; and equipment 
 
         maintenance, especially in view of the strain 
 
         of keeping machines operating 24/7 in the

         extreme conditions of heat and dust; all the 
 
         while trying to remain sensitive to the

         emotions of victims' families and uniformed 
 
         rescuers, proceeding with dignity and 
 
         solemnity, and trying to get the job done

         safely.

			<p>What's happening now and what are our

         plans for the future?  DDC is working together 
 
         with OEM to address future preparedness 
 
         concerns and to make sure efforts are 
 
         coordinated, and in fact, is currently 
 
         re building OEM's new emergency command center.

         DDC and OEM have received a grant to create a 
 
         protocol for emergency responses for 
 
         contractors, and specifications for procuring

         contractors in the event of an emergency.

			<p>Please urge Congress to enact

         legislation providing for federal indemnity, 
 
         making it clear that contractors can go in and 
 
         do the work in the event of another disaster,

         and not incur liability.  The four construction 
 
         companies that DDC contacted put aside all

         other business and standard operating 
 
         procedures and responded with a sense of 
 
         patriotism, working without contracts.  The

         indemnity issues remain unresolved, and these 
 
         companies have been incredibly patient.

         However, the costs of defending themselves 
 
         against lawsuits may be economically 
 
         devastating, and such considerations could 
 
         prove prohibitive, in the event that they are 
 
         called upon again.

			<p>The largest and most emotional rescue 
 
         and recovery job in American history was also 
 
         an exceptionally safe project, due to a

         combination of our safety plan and its 
 
         enforcement, and luck.  There were no deaths

         and minimal injuries; which is absolutely 
 
         incredible, in light of the magnitude of this 
 
         job and its hazards.

			<p>The work that the City and its 
 
         employees accomplished reflects the

         extraordinary talent, dedication and heart that 
 
         makes New York such a special place.  From the 
 
         first days at emergency headquarters at P.S.

         89, a few blocks from Ground Zero, where we all 
 
         struggled to make sense of what needed to be

         done and to find ways to do what was necessary, 
 
         to the final emotional days of the cleanup, DDC 
 
         staff and other City employees exhibited a 
 
         strength of character, determination, and a 
 
         sense of duty that is inspiring.

			<p>New York City can do extraordinary 
 
         things.  Everyone involved, engineers and 
 
         architects, surveyors, uniformed personnel,

         numerous diverse groups of City workers, 
 
         Salvation Army and Red Cross volunteers,

         private contractors and construction project 
 
         managers, operating engineers, ironworkers and 
 
         laborers, can all be proud of what we all

         achieved together, possible only because we 
 
         were united in a spirit of cooperation and

         resolve to get the job done.

			<p>Thank you.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Senator Max Cleland will

         lead the questions.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  I'd like to say that Mr.

         Kelley and Mr. Baker and Mr. Holden, I don't 
 
         think any local responders have ever been 
 
         called upon to do what you have been able to 
 
         do.  From Arlington to New York City, all of us 
 
         in America are proud of all of you.  Mr. Baker,

         you said this was the greatest structural 
 
         collapse in the history of the world and, Mr. 
 
         Holden, that makes your clean up the biggest

         clean up that has ever been done based on this 
 
         structural collapse.

			<p>Mr. Baker, I understand there were 
 
         some conclusions to the Civil Engineers' 
 
         report.  Could you talk a little about that,

         about some of the weakness you found in the 
 
         structure of the World Trade Center.

			<p>MR. BAKER:  This initial report was 
 
         really more of question of our report than it 
 
         was trying to find findings.  It was a very,

         very complicated site with a lot happening.  We 
 
         are trying to get this document released, the

         Word Trade Center Performance Study, which is a 
 
         FEMA document is available to you.  What we 
 
         were trying to do was, we are trying to pull 
 
         the information together that was available, 
 
         and somewhat package it so that it would be

         available for future researchers and try to 
 
         prioritize.  That was mainly the emphasis.

			<p>We put together a few likely scenarios

         for some of the collapses, but we gained no 
 
         conclusions as to what they were.  A lot of our

         questions, certainly there were a lot of 
 
         discussions about the nature of the collapses 
 
         of the twin towers.

			<p>As a structural engineer, I have to 
 
         say that most structural engineers were

         surprised at the collapse after it had survived 
 
         the airplane impact, but in retrospect, maybe 
 
         we should have known better.

			<p>One of the things that surprised us 
 
         quite a bit was the collapse of Building 7.  It

         didn't get a lot of press, but it was a 
 
         47 story building, 2 million square feet, a big 
 
         building.  And it was the first building that 
 
         had ever collapsed, ever, that had been a 
 
         fireproof steel building that collapsed in an

         uncontrolled fire.  So it was the first time. 
 
         That building was not hit by an airplane, so 
 
         the collapse of that building is a very

         important one, and that is one that the study 
 
         is ongoing on.

			<p>There were two likely scenarios 
 
         presented.  One is, diesel fuel, and a lot of 
 
         emergency generation in that building.  Some

         people give that credibility.  We don't know. 
 
         The other was perhaps just a simple paper

         storage fire.  Turns out one of the best 
 
         sources of fuel there is, is paper, okay.  It 
 
         could have been something as simple as a file

         room that burned for seven hours.

			<p>Those are things    it really wasn't a

         question of nailing the thing.  I think it will 
 
         probably take a couple of years before we 
 
         really know why some of these buildings 
 
         actually collapsed.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  From the audience I

         heard a phrase there "what about fire 
 
         proofing?" I guess it was based on code; right?

			<p>MR. BAKER:  Yes.  There are questions

         about fire proofing in the buildings.  Building 
 
         7, I am not aware of any issues, and that's

         certainly part of the new study.  There were 
 
         some questions about the fireproofing in the 
 
         towers.  There had been efforts to increase the

         thickness of some of the fireproofing in the 
 
         towers, and whether or not that was done.  It

         was not complete at the time of the impact.

			<p>Tower 2, which is the second one hit, 
 
         the first one collapsed, was hit in a zone

         where the fire proofing had not been upgraded. 
 
         It is an unknown thing if that was significant

         or not.  It is quite likely that that 
 
         particular structure would not have survived 
 
         regardless, because there is a theory that is 
 
         kind of post this report is that, even though 
 
         the fires, that were burning there weren't in

         the sense of building fires that large, there 
 
         was a lot of fireproofing that was knocked off.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  Lot of what?

			<p>MR. BAKER:  A lot of fireproofing that 
 
         was knocked off by the impact of the airplane.

         These airplanes were going extremely fast. 
 
         They are going cruising speeds down that low. 
 
         It was, I think, close around 560, 600 miles

         per hour, if I remember correctly.  So they are 
 
         going very, very quickly.  There is a lot of

         debris, ripping off a lot of fireproofing, and then the ensuing fire.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  Mr. Kelley, what was 
 
         your biggest challenges at the Pentagon?

			<p>MR. KELLEY:  Our challenges were 
 
         actually manifold.  First was perimeter scene

         security.  Here you have the nation's defense. 
 
         You have a hole in the building.  You have 
 
         rescuers and responders responding to assist 
 
         and aid.  Both civilian, fire, police and 
 
         gaining control of those folks and making sure

         that we had accountability for those people.

			<p>Getting logistics to the scene and 
 
         getting the materials that we needed to the

         scene.  Though it wasn't a huge problem, it was 
 
         at first because the Federal Government had let

         out because there was a terrorist attack, so 
 
         now this log jammed all the highways and byways 
 
         that we needed in order to get materials in,

         until we got control and got all those people 
 
         gone, and then we could start getting in the

         resources that we needed.  Those were 
 
         probably the two biggest things in a large 
 
         scope.

			<p>Insofar as the Fire Service is 
 
         concerned, the attack inside the Pentagon    it

         is a very big building.  You have 982 foot 
 
         corridors.  We wear 45 minute, 30 minute air 
 
         packs and we had to do some very creative air 
 
         management with our air packs where we would 
 
         actually stay off air, crawl down hallways as

         long as we could, go on air, try and fight some 
 
         fire, and remember how long it took us to get 
 
         in so that we had air to get back out, so we

         wouldn't lose anybody.

			<p>Another challenge was each of the

         evacuations on the first day while we were 
 
         actively engaged in firefighting.  The first 
 
         evacuation was the structural collapse on the

         heliport side of the building.  Dropping 
 
         the hose lines, losing ground that we had

         gained in fighting the fire to evacuate out. 
 
         Those hose lines being burned up, equipment we 
 
         had left behind, having to re amass that

         equipment and go at it again.  Those were all 
 
         challenges to us on that first day in order to

         get the fire under control.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  That's amazing.  Hearing 
 
         your testimony, all of you, it reminds me of a 
 
         line from Admiral Nimitz after the battle of 
 
         Iwo Jima that "uncommon valor was a common

         virtue" and it sounds like it to me.

			<p>Mr. Holden, I would like for you to 
 
         shift a little gear here and talk to me about

         the psychological impact of you and your 
 
         wonderful people and crew working for so long

         on such a massive project, dealing with such 
 
         tragedy.  Has the City put together any kind of 
 
         program to help the psychological readjustment

         of those workers who worked so hard at Ground 
 
         Zero. What do you see about that?

			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  Actually, I believe FEMA 
 
         has put together a program that is open to all 
 
         New Yorkers, as well as the people who    both

         the construction workers and engineers who were 
 
         down at Ground Zero.  I believe it is Project

         Cope and the Liberty Project which are these 
 
         broad based counseling services.

			<p>I have talked to all my people and 
 
         still meet with them quite regularly, and a lot 
 
         of people have taken advantage of these FEMA-

         sponsored programs.  They have told me that the 
 
         people are really quite competent and quite 
 
         helpful, and it has been a big help actually.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  It seems like to me that 
 
         that's part of the terror of terrorism.  It is

         not just the people who die in the incident, 
 
         but the impact, the washover, the 
 
         psychological impact on the entire country and

         on those people who were nearest the flames, so 
 
         to speak.  In many ways just like combat, they

         live with that experience forever.

			<p>Mr. Kelley, do you want to talk to us 
 
         a little bit about some of your workers and the

         psychological impact on you?

			<p>MR. KELLEY:  Yes.  In our Department

         and in Arlington County Government they embrace 
 
         a very strong Employee Assistance Program.

			<p>At Ground Zero, at the Pentagon, from 
 
         the very moment after the attack, we actually 
 
         had EAP workers with the collapse rescue teams

         and the firefighters right there on the scene, 
 
         24 hours a day, for all ten days that we were 
 
         there.  Even if it was just to go get somebody

         an apple or to bring a cell phone to them to 
 
         speak to their spouse or their family while they

         still working, to take some of the stress and 
 
         pressure away.  It was very important.

			<p>As far as wellness for the community

         and to make Arlington whole again and the 
 
         region whole, once again we got a grant and

         they started a program called Community 
 
         Resilience, where they went physically door to 
 
         door    they learned this from Oklahoma City,

         where they had clinicians that went door to 
 
         door throughout the resident and the business

         community, first in the Pentagon region and 
 
         Crystal City area, but then expanded out 
 
         through Arlington and into the schools, to help 
 
         the community deal with stress and to deal 
 
         with the things that they find after an attack

         like this.

			<p>There is a website that folks can go 
 
         to, to get pointers and to get tips and it's

         www.communityresilience.com, and it has very 
 
         good information for any community.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  As a firefighter, and 
 
         you and your firefighters, when you go in to 
 
         talk to kids and children, they have been

         powerfully impacted.  They don't have a lot of 
 
         defenses that adults have, maybe sometimes that

         good.  Can you tell us a little bit about the 
 
         impact on some of the kids in the schools, and 
 
         what you are telling the kids?

			<p>MR. KELLEY:  Well, the impact is 
 
         twofold.  The impact is to our own children who

         are scared when their parents, the police 
 
         officers and the firefighters, go to work now. 
 
         Daddy or mommy, are you sure you are going to 
 
         come home?  And so to reassure them and get 
 
         them well.

			<p>In the schools, the best way that we 
 
         deal with kids    we got wonderful drawings and 
 
         wonderful sentiments from the kids and you

         could really see their feelings, in what you were 
 
         talking about, in their art work and in what

         they were saying, which we used as inspiration. 
 
         We have these things in all our fire stations, 
 
         hung all over the place.  We brought them down

         to the scene and put them right up on the side 
 
         of the Pentagon as folks would send these

         things to us, to keep the rescue workers going.

			<p>We say to the kids, yes, we are still 
 
         here.  Yes, some horrible things have happened

         and this is a tragic event, but we are still 
 
         here.  We are going to be safe.  We were there

         and we are standing here now talking to you. 
 
         We need to move on.

			<p>That's kind of how we are handling it, 
 
         but at a more elementary level.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  Mr. Holden, you have a

         whole city, a whole big community to deal with. 
 
         For you and some of your workers, I am sure you 
 
         get called upon by the schools to go out and

         talk about the experience.  What are you 
 
         telling the kids, can you share that with us?

			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  Actually, I haven't given 
 
         a lot of talks to kids.  I have given talks to 
 
         university students and engineering students

         primarily about the engineering projects.  But 
 
         insofar as disaster response, I have not given

         a whole lot of talks, if any, to elementary or 
 
         junior high school kids.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  Mr. Baker, you have

         looked at this report.  What is the one 
 
         conclusion that you would draw and would give

         to this Commission or to your fellow structural 
 
         engineers around America about what you have 
 
         learned? 
 
			<p>MR. BAKER:  It sounds trivial, but you 
 
         cannot allow large airplanes to fly into

         buildings.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  I am sorry?

			<p>MR. BAKER:  You cannot allow large

         airplanes to fly into buildings.  You cannot 
 
         design against it.  Smaller planes, like that

         tragedy down in Tampa where the kid flew the 
 
         little airplane, that is not gong hurt a 
 
         building.

			<p>But if you have a large commercial 
 
         aircraft, passenger or cargo, I don't care why

         it is there, those large airplanes, you cannot design 
 
         against it.  If you look at the 767, it is a 
 
         big airplane.  There are bigger airplanes out

         there, quite a bit bigger.  There are the 747s, 
 
         there is A380 Airbus which is on the boards in Europe, much

         larger planes.  Both cargo and passenger 
 
         airplanes have to have foolproof safety systems.

			<p>MR. CLELAND:  Mr. Chairman, some of 
 
         the other Commissioners might have some 
 
         questions.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Yes, they do.  Commissioner 
 
         Roemer.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

			<p>First of all, I remember 9/11 as if it 
 
         was yesterday, as a member of Congress, and a

         member of the Intelligence Committee and as 
 
         somebody who was right across the river from 
 
         the Pentagon, Mr. Kelley.

			<p>After a full day of scrambling around 
 
         trying access to intelligence and figure out

         what was happening to the country and how we 
 
         should react in making sure the legislative 
 
         branch was moving forward in getting the right

         briefings, I felt like many Americans and 
 
         wanted to contribute somehow.

			<p>Everybody had seen what had happened 
 
         in New York all day.  So at about 11:00 or 
 
         12:00 at night, I drove across the river and 
 
         was able to get through the barricades and 
 
         right to the front, about 500 yards from the

         Pentagon.  I sloshed through ankle deep water 
 
         to get over there to see if there was anything 
 
         I could do, or at least to see it, so that I

         could see what these terrorists had done to our 
 
         country.  I was mesmerized, looking at this

         huge fortress, this structure that looked like 
 
         a steel boot had come down on the top of it and 
 
         just made a paper accordion out of it.

			<p>You were there.  You had fire trucks' 
 
         ladders going up both sides of the building

         that was still on fire at that time of night. 
 
         Your folks were scrambling everywhere to see 
 
         what they could do to help others.  And I will

         never forget, and I tell my four kids about 
 
         this, turning around from that site of horror

         and terror and seeing all of you as an army of 
 
         America, lined up to heal America and take them 
 
         forward.  And you guys did it, and accomplished 
 
         so much, and I think it's the story of courage 
 
         and bravery that so many of us are proud of,

         and inspire us to work hard and try to get to 
 
         the bottom of what happened and try to make the 
 
         country a better place in the future, as well.

			<p>I want to personally thank you and 
 
         everybody in the Fire Department of Arlington

         and Alexandria, and rescue crews, and if you 
 
         can take that back to them, this Commission 
 
         very much appreciates what you help us with.

			<p>And New York, Mr. Holden, I can't say 
 
         I was fortunate enough to come up to New York

         City.  I can say that I will never forget it, 
 
         coming up a couple of days afterwards as a 
 
         member of Intelligence Committee, and going to

         Ground Zero.  And I went on a boat up the 
 
         Hudson River because it was too difficult to

         get through the town.  A sergeant of the Police 
 
         Department was taking us up, driving the boat.

			<p>I asked Tony what he was doing on the 
 
         day and how he felt New York was reacting to 
 
         it.  After telling me about all the people that

         were literally jumping off into the water to 
 
         try to get away from the collapsing buildings, 
 
         and he would ferry them over to New Jersey for

         triage.

			<p>I asked him again, how does New York

         feel they are doing now.  This grizzled veteran 
 
         of probably all kinds of things that he had 
 
         seen and heard in New York, looked at me.  He

         was 55 or 60, he had huge tears falling down 
 
         his cheeks.  He said, "we feel like we could

         never do enough to help each other."

			<p>Well you did, and you came forward and 
 
         did extraordinary work in record time to clean

         things up and to move people forward to try to 
 
         heal the process.

			<p>I wish Commissioners Scoppetta and 
 
         Kelly were here so that we could thank them.  I 
 
         hope you will pass that on, on our or behalf 
 
         and I hope you will make sure that we get an 
 
         opportunity to talk to them at a later date.

			<p>Along those lines, Mr. Baker, I want 
 
         to ask you, based upon your expertise and your 
 
         insight on this, it is quite a compliment to

         pick somebody of your skill for this kind of 
 
         endeavour, to look at the twin towers, in

         particular, and see what happened.  So I want 
 
         to ask you, specifically, given this counsel 
 
         that you bring, this insight that you bring to

         this report.

			<p>You said you were pleasantly surprised

         by the integrity and the structure of some of 
 
         the other buildings.  Were you concerned or 
 
         disturbed at all by any of the features, the

         design and the structural engineering of the 
 
         twin towers when you studied them?

			<p>MR. BAKER:  It took a long time to 
 
         come to grips with the collapse.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  When you did come to 
 
         grips with it, what did you conclude?

			<p>MR. BAKER:  I am not sure that    I

         think the building performed remarkably well, 
 
         actually.  You never want it to collapse, but 
 
         one of the things you might say about it, it

         was a very strong building.  It took a huge 
 
         amount of damage.  So many columns were knocked

         out.  We counted the ones on the perimeter and 
 
         a large number of columns were knocked out 
 
         initially.

			<p>Later studies, ongoing studies have indicated 
 
         that a large number of core columns were

         knocked out and the building still did not come 
 
         down immediately.  So the nature of the 
 
         structure was enough that it could hold itself

         together long enough for people to get out.

			<p>A lot of people did get out and

         approximately, I believe, 99 percent of the 
 
         people who were below the impact zones were 
 
         able to get out, according to articles in New 
 
         York Times and U.S.A.  Today.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  I just have a couple of

         questions and then I want to make sure the 
 
         other Commissioners have an opportunity to ask 
 
         questions as well.

			<p>Apart from the plane hitting these 
 
         buildings and bringing them down, let me ask

         you specifically about the structure of the 
 
         buildings, or the uniqueness of them apart from 
 
         the plane hitting them.

			<p>Do you know of any other high rise or 
 
         super high rise buildings that have floors

         composed of open web trusses spanning up to 60 
 
         feet?

			<p>MR. BAKER:  No, I do not.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  Is that something that 
 
         would concern you?

			<p>MR. BAKER:  It is something to be 
 
         looked at very closely.  We were not able to 
 
         look at that closely in this situation. 
 
			<p>What you are referring to is these are 
 
         commonly called bar joists.  You see them in

         the roofs and ceilings of big box retail like a 
 
         Wal Mart.  It is a very lightweight truss. 
 
         There are things the industry needs to do to

         study these things further.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  So that could be of

         concern and that disturbed you?

			<p>MR. BAKER:  It is something that we 
 
         don't have the answer on and I personally would

         not ever use them in this type of building.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  So you will recommend

         other high rise buildings not use them.

			<p>MR. BAKER:  Until we know more about 
 
         it.  If fact, there is draft out for the New

         York City Code which has recommended a 
 
         temporary moratorium on the use of these types

         of trusses in high rise buildings until it is 
 
         better understood how they can be fireproofed 
 
         and the integrity of the fireproofing. 
 
			<p>The issue comes down that they are 
 
         very small bars, about one inch diameter and

         whether or not you can adequately fireproof 
 
         those.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  Specifically, I know

         Senator Cleland asked a general question about 
 
         fireproofing.  Let me ask you a more specific

         one.

			<p>Was half an inch thickness of 
 
         fireproofing on the floor trusses sufficient to

         give a three hour fire rating, in your view?

			<p>MR. BAKER:  I doubt that a three hour

         fire rating was required for the floor trusses, 
 
         just an as a point of reference.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  I didn't ask that.

			<p>MR. BAKER:  No.  I would be very 
 
         surprised if a half inch would give three

         hours.  We did not study that specifically, but 
 
         I would be very surprised.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  Finally, did you see or 
 
         hear of any evidence in the course of your 
 
         inquiry, that the fireproofing of the twin

         towers was inadequate?  Obviously, you just 
 
         said you had a concern, but any others?

			<p>MR. BAKER:  We do know there was an

         ongoing program to replace fireproofing in the 
 
         towers, that the Port Authority, as the floors

         are re-tenantized and made available, that they were 
 
         going back in there and putting additional 
 
         fireproofing onto the floor trusses.

			<p>There had been some issues of some of 
 
         the fireproofing falling off of some of the

         core columns in the elevator shafts, and there 
 
         had been some earlier lawsuits.  We were not 
 
         able to get access to that information to know

         the details.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  You tried get access to

         it?

			<p>MR. BAKER:  Yes, we had no authority.  It 
 
         was all locked up in legal    there were 
 
         nondisclosure agreements on lawsuits and the 
 
         like.  We couldn't get the information.

			<p>MR. ROEMER:  Thank you, Mr. Baker.

			<p>MR. LEHMAN:  First, I would like to 
 
         associate myself with the earlier comments of

         great admiration.  I think that you and you 
 
         colleagues made the whole country very proud,

         and impressed it the world with the way the 
 
         response was immediate.  It engaged every asset 
 
         available in the cities and the districts

         available, and everyone on the sites showed 
 
         courageous disregard for their own personal

         safety, not to mention the trial lawyers 
 
         association, which the Mayor alluded to earlier 
 
         on.

			<p>So please take the questions that I am 
 
         going to ask, in the spirit that they are

         intended, which is to get onto the record as 
 
         much of the lessons learned as possible so that 
 
         we can make appropriate recommendations for the 
 
         future.  This is not intended to try and point 
 
         fingers at anyone or so forth.

			<p>There have been a lot of questions 
 
         raised since then about why, after it was 
 
         clear, this was perhaps a measure of weeks

         rather than days, that there could be no more 
 
         survivors from the wreckage, why was the site not

         made a crime zone and given the proper 
 
         protection so that evidence and forensic 
 
         investigations could be taking place?  Why

         wasn't that done?

			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  I believe that security

         around the site, and the Police Department, in 
 
         fact, did call it a crime zone, and it was very 
 
         difficult to get access to the site as the

         Police Department and the National Guard and 
 
         Army were called in to provide security to

         prevent people who need not be at the site, you 
 
         know, were kept away from the site.

			<p>As you mentioned, we believed that 
 
         there were, in fact, survivors for many weeks 
 
         early on.  So our main goal was basically to

         remove, particularly the heavy steel beams to 
 
         allow the Fire Department and Police Department 
 
         to continue with their searching operations,

         with their rescue operations.

			<p>MR. LEHMAN:  You mentioned the steel.

         There have been other questions raised about 
 
         why the steel was removed to a site and then 
 
         ordered destroyed without being made available

         to the overall investigation of the structural 
 
         clues that would have helped in really

         evaluating where failures took place and 
 
         whether these codes were met.  Why and how was 
 
         the decision made to destroy that steel?

			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  Again, you have to go 
 
         back 19 months and put yourself in the position

         of trying to find survivors.

			<p>Our priority at that time, in 
 
         September and October, was still looking for 
 
         survivors.  The steel was precluding that from 
 
         happening because much of the debris early on

         was being sent to the Fresh Kills Landfill.  It 
 
         became clear after three or four days that the 
 
         equipment that the Department of Sanitation had

         to handle the City's garbage was not equipped 
 
         to be able to pick up those large pieces of

         steel.  And those large pieces of steel were 
 
         preventing the rescue workers from crawling 
 
         into crevices and voids underground.

			<p>We really had no place to put it. 
 
         There is no place to put 170,000 or 180,000

         tons of structural steel.  We were pressed by 
 
         the urgency of trying to find survivors.  We 
 
         looked at a number of operations.  We knew that

         some of the steel might have asbestos- 
 
         containing materials on it.  We knew that we

         couldn't just dispose of it, but it was not an 
 
         option to continue sending it to the Fresh 
 
         Kills Landfill where all the debris was being taken.  
 
         The only options, based on discussions both 
 
         internally with our engineers, as well with New

         York State with the State of New Jersey and with 
 
         the Environmental Protection Agency was to 
 
         basically ship it off to New Jersey and recycle

         it.  No one was volunteering to just store that 
 
         huge volume of steel.  They would only take it

         if they could melt it and recycle it.

			<p>We really couldn't figure out any 
 
         other option at the time.

			<p>MR. LEHMAN:  This was a sort of crisis 
 
         management group decision, it wasn't any one

         person that dictated it?

			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  This was my decision.

			<p>MR. LEHMAN:  Okay.  I have read that

         the twin towers, because they were owned by the 
 
         Port Authority were actually exempt or outside

         of the enforcement codes for the City of New 
 
         York.  Is that true?

			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  I'm not a Port Authority 
 
         employee, but the buildings are in fact Port 
 
         Authority and I am almost certain that they are

         exempt from following New York City Building 
 
         Code requirements.

			<p>MR. LEHMAN:  Isn't that something that

         we ought to address or that should be remedied? 
 
         Why should a building like that in the middle

         of the City of New York be exempt from State 
 
         and City codes?

			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  I think that warrants

         looking into.

			<p>MR. LEHMAN:  Mr. Baker, I would like

         to ask you, did the buildings conform, at the 
 
         time of their construction, to prevailing 
 
         standards of survivability and structural

         integrity that were prevailing at the time of 
 
         their construction?

			<p>MR. BAKER:  In the short period of 
 
         time that we produced this report, that was not 
 
         studied in detail.  My understanding is that 
 
         NIST, at this point, has actually, is trying to 
 
         commission a study to do a detailed review of

         the prevailing codes, particularly the New York 
 
         City Building Codes vis-a-vis the construction 
 
         documents.  So that was not done as part of the

         study.

			<p>MR. LEHMAN:  We look forward to

         receiving that when that is done, or if we can 
 
         be of any assistance to see that it is 
 
         completed before the end of our report, that

         would be very helpful.

			<p>Mr. Baker, how was the decision made,

         or what were obstacles made to keep you from 
 
         the site for so long while so much of the 
 
         evidence was being removed?  I don't mean

         evidence in terms of liability and so forth, 
 
         but evidence in terms of learning the lessons.

			<p>MR. BAKER:  I am not sure I know all 
 
         the details, but basically we were told that 
 
         the folks on site did not necessarily want 
 
         other extraneous people walking around.  They 
 
         had their hands full at the moment.

			<p>I personally was on the site much 
 
         earlier than that because as part of the other 
 
         activities, as part of assisting the search and

         rescue.  But the rest of the team was not able 
 
         to get access because of the nature of

         activities before October 6, when we actually 
 
         did get access.  I believe we were deemed to be 
 
         superfluous at that point.

			<p>MR. LEHMAN:  Perhaps, Mr. Holden, you 
 
         might shed a little light on it.  Was it

         because they were deemed to superfluous or was 
 
         it, by this time had the fear of litigation, as 
 
         the Mayor spoke to yesterday, begun to enter

         the calculations of City officials.

			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  It took a lot of months

         to go by before I started thinking about 
 
         litigation, quite frankly.

			<p>I am not sure exactly about when the 
 
         American Society of Civil Engineers came on 
 
         site.  I know we worked with SEAoNY, which Mr.

         Baker alluded to earlier, which was a State 
 
         organization of structural engineers who worked 
 
         with numerous city structural engineers, as

         well as structural engineers we had hired to 
 
         both examine buildings and look at the site.

			<p>The problem, again, going back 18, 19 
 
         months ago, was that you had a very difficult 
 
         site to control.  As you alluded to earlier, it

         was a crime scene so access was limited.  We 
 
         also, especially that first week or two, had

         thousands of volunteers coming down to the 
 
         site, which a was a wonderful and much 
 
         appreciated outpouring of spirit.  However, it

         was an extremely unsafe site and we were very 
 
         concerned that having hundreds and thousands of

         people walking around the site, could cause 
 
         further fatalities.  And if the Mayor gave us 
 
         one clear marching order, it was that no one 
 
         else was to die at that site.

			<p>I am not exactly certain when the

         American Society of Civil Engineers were 
 
         looking to gain access, but early on some of 
 
         the constraints were, in fact, the fact that it

         was a crime scene and there were just safety 
 
         concerns.  We were trying to grapple with what

         was there, and how many people we could allow 
 
         on site, how stable the various piles were, how 
 
         unstable.

			<p>I am sure you remember the facades of 
 
         towers 1 and 2, we were not certain about

         stable those facades were.  We were very 
 
         concerned about having so many people walk 
 
         around the site.

			<p>However, I would never use word that 
 
         Mr. Baker used, calling the engineers

         "superfluous," they were extremely helpful.

			<p>Those are just some of the general 
 
         difficulties in allowing people on the site. 
 
			<p>MR. LEHMAN:  Thank you for your 
 
         responses.  They are very helpful.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Thank you, Commissioner 
 
         Ben Veniste.

			<p>MR. BEN VENISTE:  I have a question

         for Mr. Holden.  Following up on my friend and 
 
         colleague, Max Cleland, who was quite

         interested in the effects of terrorism and the 
 
         lingering trauma of those who have experienced 
 
         it firsthand, My alma mater, Stuyvesant High

         School is located four blocks north of World 
 
         Trade Center.  On September 11, 2001, they were

         evacuated from the school.  The evacuation 
 
         notice was "run for your lives."

			<p>Hundreds and hundreds of teenagers,

         from all parts of the City, made their way on 
 
         their own out of the toxic plume, watching as

         people jumped to their deaths from these 
 
         buildings, an extraordinary traumatic 
 
         experience. 
 
			<p>Can you comment on what the City has 
 
         done with respect to trying to provide guidance

         counselling follow up for the children who were 
 
         directly exposed to this tragedy?

			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  I wish I could, but I am

         really not qualified.  Those questions are 
 
         really much better addressed either to the

         Commission of Department of Mental Health, or what is now 
 
         the Department of Education.  But really the 
 
         Department of Design and Construction was

         really limited in its focus to demolition of 
 
         the existing structures and debris removal.

			<p>I am just not qualified to speak to 
 
         your question.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Commissioner Gorelick.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  This is for Shawn 
 
         Kelley.  A number of us on this panel have

         served at various times at the Pentagon and we 
 
         are aware that the cafe in the middle of the 
 
         Pentagon is called Ground Zero. 
 
			<p>MR. KELLEY:  Not anymore.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  It was.  So we knew

         that we were working in a place that was a 
 
         possible target.

			<p>We heard testimony yesterday that the

         evacuation procedures at the Pentagon were not 
 
         understood, at least, and not well practiced

         and could not be followed by the people in the 
 
         building.

			<p>So my question for you is, did you

         conclude or did your After Action Report 
 
         conclude that there were any failures in the

         evacuation process at the Pentagon after the 
 
         plane slammed into it?

			<p>MR. KELLEY:  We have emergency

         incidents at the Pentagon every day.  We run an 
 
         average of two responses a day at the Pentagon.

         I personally investigated a fire there two 
 
         weeks prior.  So it is 11 percent of our call 
 
         volume is to federal facilities within 
 
         Arlington.

			<p>We have never experienced in the past

         a problem in evacuating the occupants from 
 
         different sections or parts of that building, 
 
         out and away from where the danger is, along

         with the assistance of the Defense Protective 
 
         Services, the police officers, that work in and

         out everyday around the building.

			<p>In this particular event or in this 
 
         particular incident, to have this plane and

         almost the entire plane made it into the first 
 
         floor of this building, and to penetrate in

         three rings, and I am not going to go into the 
 
         floorplan of the Pentagon, but to penetrate in 
 
         three rings and then pop out into what they

         call A&E Drive.

			<p>I will say that most all the fire

         doors did work, in the outer corridors.  That 
 
         is good and bad.  The fire doors closed like they 
 
         should, and then it was dark and held smoke and 
 
         could have possibly caused further injury or 
 
         death to some of the folks.

			<p>They had also just done construction 
 
         and updated the Pentagon and installed some new 
 
         windows which were not openable.  That also had

         some impact on the building not being able to 
 
         breathe or let out its products.

			<p>With regard to where the Pentagon is 
 
         now, I can share with you that they have 
 
         installed some enhancements to assist in easier

         evacuation.  In fact, in my opinion, it is 
 
         state of the art now.  It is an example for the

         rest of nation to follow.  Some of those things 
 
         can't be shared.  It is truly, truly an example 
 
         now.  The employees do practice evacuation

         drills.

			<p>The Pentagon has even approached my

         office, the Fire Marshal's office, to have two 
 
         deputy marshals assigned down there, a third party to 
 
         ensure that proper code enforcement is 
 
         conducted.  Not that it isn't now, but just to 
 
         have a third party assessment to assist in

         things like evacuation plans and drills, and 
 
         things like that.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  Thank you very much.

			<p>MR. KELLEY:  You're welcome.  If I 
 
         may, the After Action Report, if you don't

         mind, you did mention it.  It is available for 
 
         free for everyone, I am not trying to make an 
 
         ad, but it is real important in the Fire

         Service that we study ourselves and learn from 
 
         action and have other persons learn, good or

         bad.  If there is criticisms, then folks need 
 
         to fix them so that if things didn't go so 
 
         well, that they are prepared or do better.

			<p>MS. GORELICK:  That is an excellent 
 
         great note on which to end the hearing.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  I would like ask a question 
 
         before we end.  Mr. Holden, first, when you got 
 
         to the site, who was in charge? 
 
			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  I would say the Fire 
 
         Department and the Police Department.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Jointly in charge?

			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  Yes, the Fire Department 
 
         was clearly putting out fires and the Police

         Department was handling security.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Three or four hours later,

         who was in charge?

			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  The same people.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Did that change later?

			<p>MR. HOLDEN:  I don't think that really 
 
         changed until, again, now I am just giving you

         my impressions.  I don't think that really 
 
         changed until several days later when the 
 
         National Guard, Governor Pataki brought in the

         National Guard, and I believe some Army units 
 
         were down helping with security.  Although

         certainly, the Fire Department was playing a 
 
         major focus on the interior.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  Mr. Baker, when you got on 
 
         site, who was in charge then?

			<p>MR. BAKER:  My impression when I was

         there was that the people in overall charge of 
 
         it was the Fire Department of the sectors, but the 
 
         operational control were the contractors.

         These contractors were very, very good.  They 
 
         are used to managing very large projects and

         have command structures within their groups, 
 
         who know how to bring in heavy equipment.  They 
 
         know how to deal with subcontractors, and all

         that kind of stuff.

			<p>So a lot of the operational, who goes

         there, we want to see if that building is going 
 
         collapse, let's go into this thing and look 
 
         around.  Really our interface was with

         the general contractors, they did an excellent 
 
         job.

			<p>MR. KEAN:  I want to thank you all 
 
         very, very much.  This has been a very good 
 
         panel and a very instructive panel.  Thank you 
 
         for your answers.  Thank you for your presence, 
 
         we appreciate it very much.

			<p>That ends our hearing.

			<p>(Whereupon, the proceedings were 
 
         adjourned.)
