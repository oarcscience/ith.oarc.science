MR. THOMAS H. KEAN: I'd like to call the hearing to order. As chairman
of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States,
I hereby convene the seventh public hearing. This hearing's going to run
over the course of two days, from 9:00 o'clock to 4:30 around today and
tomorrow. We have taken it as the topic of today's hearing "Borders,
Transportation and Managing Risk." Today we're going to focus primarily
on border security.

We intend to be covering a lot of ground today. So we can get right to
business at hand, I'm going to keep these opening remarks very brief. I
will, however, make just two points before we begin. First, we'd like
the American people to know that the Commission is deep into its work.
We and our staff continue to work our way through more than two million
pages of documents. We have interviewed more than 900 people and will be
interviewing several hundred more before we conclude our work.

We have access to some of the most sensitive information in the
possession of the United States government. Outstanding requests for
additional materials that were the subject of subpoenas the Commission
issued have been resolved. We are carrying out our mandate to provide a
full and complete account of the events of September 11th, 2001 and to
recommend ways to make the people of our country safer and more secure.
We intend to write a strong and a creditable report.

Now I want to say just a word about today's hearing. Today and tomorrow
staff will present facts uncovered in our investigation thus far into
the events that transpired on September 11th, 2001. We believe that what
we present today will provide new information about the attacks of
September 11th. What we have learned certainly will impact our
investigation and impact the final report that we prepare. Today we will
hear from four panels of witnesses. Two will be proceeded by statements
from the Commission staff, summarizing what we have learned to date
about incidents, about which witnesses will testify.

To start, I would now like to recognize Dr. Philip Zelikow, the
Commission's executive director, who will begin the first staff
statement. He will be followed by Ms. Susan Ginsburg, who directs the
part of the investigation that pertains to the subject of today's
hearing.

MR. PHILIP D. ZELIKOW: Members of the Commission, working with you we
have developed initial findings on how the individuals who carried out
the 9/11 attacks entered the United States. We have also developed
initial findings on terrorists who failed in their efforts to enter the
United States. These findings lead us to some tentative judgments on the
way the United States targets the travel of international terrorists.
This staff statement represents the collective effort of several members
of our staff. Susan Ginsburg, Thomas Eldridge and Janice Kephart-Roberts
did most of the investigative work reflected in this statement.

The Commission was able to build upon a large and strong body of work
carried out by many talented public servants at the Department of State,
the Central Intelligence Agency, the former Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the Department of Homeland Security and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. The American people should be proud of
the many extraordinary professionals now serving them. To the extent we
have criticisms, they are comments less on the talent available and more
on how that talent was used.

As we know from the sizeable illegal traffic across our land borders, a
terrorist could attempt to bypass legal procedures and enter the United
States surreptitiously. None of the 9/11 attackers entered or tried to
enter our country this way. So today we will focus on the hijackers
exploitation of legal entry systems. We have handed out a list attached
to the statement of the names of 9/11 attackers to help you follow our
discussion.

To break down some of al Qaeda's travel problem, view it from their
perspective. For most international travel, a terrorist has to have a
passport. To visit some countries, terrorists of certain nationalities
must obtain a document permitting them to visit, a visa. Finally, the
terrorist must actually enter the country and keep from getting detained
or deported by immigration or other law enforcement officials. Susan
Ginsburg, senior counsel to the Commission will begin by examining how
the hijackers navigated these stages.

MS. SUSAN GINSBURG: Beginning with passports. Four of the hijackers
passports have survived in whole or in part. Two were recovered from the
crash site of United Airlines flight 93 in Pennsylvania. These are the
passports of Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al Ghamdi. One belonged to a hijacker
on American Airlines flight 11. This is the passport of Satam al Suqami.
A passerby picked it up and gave it to a NYPD detective shortly before
the World Trade Center towers collapsed. A fourth passport was recovered
from luggage that did not make it from a Portland flight to Boston on to
the connecting flight which was American Airlines flight 11. This is the
passport of Abdul Aziz al Omari.

In addition to these four, some digital copies of the hijackers
passports were recovered in post-9/11 operations. Two of the passports
that have survived, those of Satam al Suqami and Abdul Aziz al Omari,
were clearly doctored. To avoid getting into classified detail, we will
just state that these were manipulated in a fraudulent manner in ways
that have been associated with al Qaeda.

Since the passports of 15 of the hijackers did not survive, we cannot
make firm factual statements about their documents. But from what we
know about al Qaeda passport practices and other information, we believe
it is possible that six more of the hijackers presented passports that
had some of these same clues to their association with al Qaeda. Other
kinds of passport markings can be highly suspicious. To avoid getting
into the classified details, we will just call these suspicious
indicators.

Two of the hijackers, Khalid al Mihdhar and Salem al Hazmi presented
passports that had such suspicious indicators. We know now that each of
these two hijackers possessed at least two passports. All of their known
passports had these suspicious indicators. We have evidence that three
other hijackers, Nawaf al Hazmi, Ahmed al Ghamdi and Ahmed al Haznawi
may have presented passports containing these suspicious indicators. But
their passports did not survive the attacks so we cannot be sure.

Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. There were significant
security weaknesses in the Saudi government's issuance of Saudi
passports in the period when the visas to the hijackers were issued. Two
of the Saudi 9/11 hijackers may have obtained their passports
legitimately or illegitimately with the help of a family member who
worked in the passport office.

We do not yet know the answer to the question whether the knowledge of
these particular clues existed in the intelligence community before
9/11. From the mid 1970s when terrorists began to launch attacks in the
Middle East and Europe, intelligence and border authorities knew that
terrorists used forged or altered travel documents. By the 1980s the
U.S. government had developed a Red Book used to guide and train
consular, immigration and customs officers throughout the world on
spotting terrorists. It included photographs of altered or stolen
passports and false travel stamps also known as cachets used by
terrorists. The importance of training border officials on use of the
Red Book is evident from a U.S. government film entitled "The Threat is
Real." Here is a brief excerpt.

(Film shown.)

The U.S. government ceased publication of the Red Book by 1992, in part
because it had fallen into the hands of terrorist groups. There
continued to be a number of government efforts to provide information
about generic forgery detection and document inspection techniques.
Before 9/11 the FBI and CIA did know of some of the practices employed
by al Qaeda. They knew this from training manuals recovered in the mid
1990s and from tracking and interrogations of al Qaeda operatives.

Some of this knowledge was revealed in individual criminal cases
prosecuted in the United States in the 1990s. And yet between 1992 and
September 11th, 2001 we have not found any signs that intelligence, law
enforcement or border inspection services sought to acquire, develop or
disseminate systematic information about al Qaeda's or other terrorist
groups travel and passport practices. Thus, such information was not
available to consular, immigration or customs officials who examined the
hijackers passports before 9/11.

Now, turning to visas. The State Department is principally responsible
for administering U.S. immigration laws outside of the United States.
Consular officers, a branch of our diplomatic corps, issue several kinds
of visas for visitors and for permanent immigrants. In 2000, these
diplomats processed about 10 million applications for visitors' visas at
over 200 posts overseas. U.S. law allows nationals of certain countries
to enter without visas on a reciprocal basis under the Visa Waiver
Program. None of the 9/11 hijackers however, were nationals of a visa
waiver country.

Before 9/11 visa applicants provided their passport, a photograph and a
written application. A State Department employee checked the passport
and application for any apparent questionable features. A consular
officer could call the applicant in for an interview. The applicant's
essential information went into a State Department database. The
information was then checked against a large consular lookout database
called CLASS which included a substantial watchlist of known and
suspected terrorists, called TIPOFF.

Our immigration system before 9/11 focused primarily on keeping
individuals intending to immigrate from improperly entering the United
States. In the visa process, the most common form of fraud is to get a
visa to visit the United States as a tourist and then stay to work and
perhaps become a resident. Consular officers concentrated on
interviewing visa applicants whom they suspected might leave and not
return.

Saudi citizens rarely overstayed their visas or tried to work illegally
in the United States. The same was true for citizens of the United Arab
Emirates. So while consular officials in both countries always screened
applicants in CLASS, including TIPOFF, they would not interview them
unless there was something about the application that seemed
problematic. Visa applicants from these countries frequently had their
applications submitted by third party facilitators, like travel
agencies.

In June 2001, the U.S. consular posts in Saudi Arabia instituted a third
party processing program called Visa Express. It required applicants to
apply through designated travel agencies instead of by mail or in
person. The program was established in part to try to keep crowds of
people from congregating outside the posts which was a security risk to
the posts and to the crowds themselves. We have found no evidence that
the Visa Express program had any effect on the interview or approval
rate for Saudi applicants or that it reduced the scrutiny given to their
applications. It actually lengthened the processing time.

With the exception of our consulates in Mexico, biometric information
like a fingerprint was not routinely collected from visa applicants
before 9/11. Terrorists therefore could easily exploit opportunities for
fraud. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the chief tactical planner and
coordinator of the 9/11 attacks, was indicted in 1996 by federal
authorities in the southern district of New York for his role in earlier
terrorist plots. Yet KSM, as he is known, obtained a visa to visit the
United States on July 23rd, 2001, about six weeks before the 9/11
attacks.

Although he is not a Saudi citizen, and we do believe he was in Saudi
Arabia at the time, he applied for a visa using a Saudi passport and an
alias, Abdulrahman al Ghamdi. He had someone else submit his
application, his Saudi passport and a photo through the Visa Express
program. There is no evidence that he ever used this visa to enter the
United States. Beginning in 1997, the 19 hijackers submitted 24
applications and received 23 visas. The pilots acquired most of theirs
in the year 2000, the other hijackers with two exceptions obtained
theirs between the fall of 2000 and June 2001.

Two of the visas were issued in Berlin and two were issued in the United
Arab Emirates, the rest were issued in Saudi Arabia. One of the pilots,
Hani Hanjour had an application denied in September 2000 for lack of
adequate documentation. He then produced more evidence in support of his
student visa application and it was approved. Except for Hanjour, all
the hijackers sought tourist visas. Of these 24 applications, four were
destroyed routinely along with other documents before their significance
was known.

To our knowledge, State consular officers followed their standard
operating procedures in every case. They performed a name check using
their lookout database including the TIPOFF watchlist. At the time these
people applied for visas, none of them, or at least none of the
identities given in their passports, were in the database. We will say
more about this in another staff statement later today.

All 20 of these applications were incomplete in some way, with a data
field left blank or not answered fully. Such omissions were common, the
consular officials focused on getting the biographical data needed for
name checks. They generally did not think the omitted items were
material to a decision about whether to issue the visa. Three of the 19
hijackers submitted applications that contained false statements, that
could have been proven to be false at the time they applied. The
applications of Hani Hanjour, Saeed al Ghamdi and Khalid Al Mihdhar
stated that they had not previously applied for a U.S. visa, when in
fact they had.

In Hanjour's case, the false statement was made in an earlier
application for a visit in 1997, not his final visa application in 2000.
Hanjour and Mihdhar also made false statements about whether they had
previously traveled to the United States. Information about these prior
applications was retrievable at the Jeddah post where each applied.
These false statements may have been intentional to cover up the
applicant's travel on old passports to suspect locations, like
Afghanistan, for terrorist training.

On the other hand these statements may have been inadvertent. During
this period, Saudi citizens often had their applications filled out and
submitted by third parties. Most importantly, evidence of the prior
visas or travel to the United States actually would have reduced concern
that the applicants were intending to immigrate, so consular officers
had no good reason to deny the visas or travel.

Al Mihdhar's case was uniquely problematical. He had been -- he had not
been entered into the TIPOFF watchlist at the time of his second visa
application in June 2001. In January 2000, the American consulate in
Jeddah had been asked about Mihdhar's visa status in conjunction with an
ongoing urgent terrorist intelligence investigation, and confirmed that
this al Qaeda operative had a U.S. visa.

When Mihdhar applied again in June 2001, the check against the worldwide
TIPOFF watchlist took place, but no system then in place included a
notation of the prior visa status check. Neither the investigating
agency, nor the post, had made the appropriate lookout entry. Thus, in
effect, the post could not remember relevant suspicions a year and a
half earlier about this same person who was traveling again with the
same biographical information.

At least two of the hijackers were actually interviewed in person in
connection with their visa applications. Hanjour was interviewed twice,
Satam al Suqami was apparently interviewed in Riyadh. Another hijacker,
Ahmed al Nami was apparently interviewed briefly, but just to clarify an
entry on his application. The three consular officers involved have some
memory of these interviews. All stated that the reasons for their
interviews had nothing to do with terrorism. They saw nothing
suspicious.

At least four individuals implicated in the 9/11 plot tried to get visas
and failed: Ramzi Binalshibh, Zakariya Essabar, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali and
Saeed al Ghamdi. This Saeed al Ghamdi is a different person from the
Saeed al Ghamdi who actually became a hijacker. Ramzi Binalshibh, a
Yemeni, apparently intended to train as a pilot along with his Hamburg
friends, Mohamed Atta, Marwan al Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah.

Binalshibh applied for a visa three times in Berlin and once in Yemen.
He first applied in Berlin on the same day as Atta. He was interviewed
twice and denied twice. Yemen is a much poorer country than Saudi
Arabia, Both times consular officers determined he did not have strong
ties to Germany and he might be intending to immigrate unlawfully to the
United States. Binalshibh tried again in Berlin, this time for a student
visa, to attend aviation school in Florida. He was again denied for lack
of adequate documentation and failure to show sufficient ties to
Germany.

Essabar, a Moroccan who may also have intended to be a pilot, tried to
get a visa in Berlin at least once, and failed because he failed to
demonstrate sufficient ties to Germany, such as a job or family there.
Third country visa applicants in Berlin were held to significantly
higher standards in terms of documentation and showing ties with their
country of residence, than were Saudi and Emirate citizens applying from
their own countries.

Ali Abdul Aziz Ali is the nephew of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and was
heavily involved in financial and logistical aspects of the 9/11 plot.
He tried to get a U.S. visa in Dubai about two weeks before the attacks.
His visa application states that he intended to enter the United States
on September 4th, 2001 for one week. As a Pakistani visa applicant in a
third country, he would have received greater scrutiny from U.S.
officials from the start. In any event, it was deemed possible that he
intended to immigrate, and accordingly he was denied a visa.

Saeed al Ghamdi also known as Jihad al Ghamdi, apparently intended to
participate in the 9/11 attacks. He is a Saudi, and applied for a
tourist visa in Jeddah on November 12, 2000, the same date as 9/11
hijacker, Ahmed al Haznawi. Haznawi was approved, but al Ghamdi was
denied after an interview with the consular officer because the consular
officer believed he was intending to immigrate.

We now turn to exit and -- entry and exit from the United States. With a
visa, an individual can travel to United States port of entry. Upon
arrival, the individual must seek admission into the United States from
an inspector of what used to be called the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, or INS, an agency whose personnel now form part
of the Department of Homeland Security. Property being brought into the
United States is checked by inspectors of the U.S. Customs Service,
whose personnel are now also part of DHS.

The 19 hijackers entered the United States a total of 33 times. They
arrived through 10 different airports, although -- though more than half
came in through Miami, JFK or Newark. A visitor with a tourist visa was
usually admitted for a stay of six months. All but two of the hijackers
were admitted for such stays. Hanjour had a student visa and was
admitted for a stay of two years, and Suqami sought and was admitted for
a stay of only 20 days.

The four pilots passed through INS and customs inspection a total of 17
times before 9/11. Hanjour came to the United States to attend school in
three stints during the 1990s. His final arrival was in December 2000
through the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky Airport. The three other
pilots, Atta, al Shehhi and Jarrah initially came in May and June 2000.
They arrived for the last time between May and August 2001. All made a
number of trips abroad during their extended stays in the United States.

Of the other 15, only Mihdhar entered the United States left and
returned. Nawaf al Hazmi arrived in January 2000 with Mihdhar and
stayed. Al Mihdhar left in June 2000 and returned to the United States
on July 4th, 2001. Ten of the others came in pairs between April and
June 2001. Three more arrived through Miami on May 28th. The INS
inspector usually had about one to one and a half minutes to assess the
traveler and make a decision on admissibility and length of stay. For
all the entries, a primary U.S. INS inspector -- a primary INS inspector
would work a lane of incoming travelers and check the people and their
passports.

The inspector would try to assess each individuals demeanor. No one
noted any anomalies in these passports, despite the fact that we now
believe that at least two, and as many as eight showed evidence of
fraudulent manipulation. The inspector would use the passport data,
especially if it was machine readable, and Saudi passports were, to
check various INS and customs databases. The databases would show the
person's immigration history information as well as terrorist watchlist
and criminal history information.

Of the five hijackers who entered the United States more than once,
three of them violated immigration law. Ziad Jarrah entered in June 2000
on a tourist visa, and then promptly enrolled in flight school for six
months. He never filed an application to change his immigration status
from tourist to student. Had the INS known he was out of status, they
could have denied him entry on any of the three subsequent occasions he
departed and returned while he was a student.

Marwan al Shehhi came in through Newark in late May 2000, followed a
week later by Mohamed Atta. Both were admitted as tourist and soon
entered flight school in Florida. In September, they did file
applications to change their status. Before 9/11, regulations allowed
tourists to change their status at any time so they were in compliance,
but both overstayed their periods of admission and completed flight
school to obtain commercial pilot licenses. Atta and al Shehhi then left
within a few days of one another and returned within a few days of one
another in June 2001 -- January 2001, while their change in visa status
from tourist to student was still pending.

Atta and al Shehhi did get some attention when both said they were
coming back to finish flight school. Primary inspectors noticed with
each that their story clashed with their attempt to reenter on tourist
visas. The rules required them to get proper student visas while they
had been overseas, since their earlier pending applications for a change
of status were considered abandoned once they left the United States.
Atta and Al-Shehhi were each referred by the primary inspectors to
secondary inspections.

At secondary, more experienced inspectors could conduct longer
interviews, check more databases, take fingerprints, examine personal
property and call on other agencies for help. The inspectors involved
have stated they do not remember these encounters. The reports indicate
that both men repeated their story about still going to flight school
and their pending applications for a change of status. The secondary
inspectors admitted Atta and al Shehhi as tourists.

Flight 93 hijacker Saeed al Ghamdi was referred to secondary immigration
inspection when he arrived in late June 2001. He had no address on his
I-94 form. He spoke little English. He had a one-way ticket and about
$500. The inspector wondered whether he was possibly intending to
immigrate. Al Ghamdi convinced the inspector that he was a tourist and
had enough money. Customs officers took a second look at two of the
hijackers but then admitted them. On Marwan al Shehhi's first entry into
the United States, a Customs officer referred him to secondary
inspection, completed the inspection and released him.

In May 2001, Waleed al Shehri and Satam al Suqami departed Florida for
the Bahamas, but were refused admission. On their way back to the United
States, a Customs officer conducting a pre-clearance in the Bahamas,
referred al Shehri to a secondary inspection. Customs then released al
Shehri to return to the United States with Suqami. We do know of one
success by immigration secondary inspection the affected the 9/11 plot.
An al Qaeda operative, Mohamed al Kahtani arrived at Orlando Airport on
August 4, 2001. Evidence strongly suggests that Mohamed Atta was waiting
there to meet him. Kahtani encountered an experienced and dedicated
inspector, Jose Melendez-Perez, we will hear his story later this
morning.

During their stays in the United States, at least six of the 9/11
hijackers violated immigration laws. We have noted Jarrah's failure to
adjust his status while he was in flight school and the violations by
Atta and al Shehhi. Hani Hanjour came in on a student visa in December
2000, but then did not attend the English language school for which his
visa was issue. Nawaf al Hazmi overstayed his term of admission by nine
months. Suqami overstayed his term of admission by four months. None of
these violations were detected or acted upon by INS inspectors or
agents.

Two programs might have helped detect such violations. One dealt with
violations of student status, the other dealt with overstays. National
security concerns about foreign students are not new. By the late 1980s,
the INS had established a student school system to track students, but
the system did not work. After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing when
it was discovered that a participant in the plot had been a student who
had overstayed his visa, the Department of Justice asked INS to devise a
better way to track students.

INS officials recommended a new student tracking system and a student ID
card that used biometric identifiers. In 1996, Congress mandated a new
system to be installed by 1998 without appropriating program funds. The
INS scraped together $10 million and piloted a successful student
tracking program in the Atlanta area in June 1997 which included a
flight school. However, advocates of education interests argued that the
program would be burdensome and costly.

Upon the order of senior INS management, the project manager was
replaced. In 1998, INS indefinitely deferred testing of the biometric
student ID card. The program stalled. Senators declared an interest in
repealing the 1996 law and sought to obstruct further INS funding for
it. Thus when Atta and al Shehhi lied when questioned about their
student status on their re-entries in January 2001, and when Hanjour
failed to show up for the school for which he was issued a visa in
December 2000, a student tracking system was far from available to
immigration inspectors or agents.

Congress required the attorney general to develop an entry-exit system
in 1996. The system's purpose was to improve INS's ability to address
illegal migration and overstays of all types of foreign visitors. By
1998 Congress had appropriated about $40 million to develop the system.
Advocates for border communities, however, were concerned that an
entry-exit system would slow down trade. INS officials decided to forgo
the system at land borders and only to automate the entry process. The
automation process was not successful. The result was that when
hijackers Suqami and Nawaf al Hazmi overstayed their visas, the system
Congress envisaged did not exist.

Moreover, when federal law enforcement authorities realized in late 2001
that Mihdhar had entered with Hazmi in January 2000 at Los Angeles, they
could not reliably determine whether or not Hazmi was still in the
United States along with Mihdhar.

MR. ZELIKOW: In conclusion, the director of the FBI testified that,
quote, "Each of the hijackers came easily and lawfully from abroad." The
director of Central Intelligence described 17 of the 19 hijackers as,
quote, "Clean," close quote. We believe the information we have provided
today gives the Commission the opportunity to reevaluate those
statements. Based on our evaluation of the hijackers travel documents,
the visa process, the entries into the United States and the compliance
with immigration law while the attackers were here, we have a few
observations.

Considered collectively, the 9/11 hijackers included among them known al
Qaeda operatives who could have been watchlisted, presented passports
manipulated in a fraudulent manner, presented passports with suspicious
indicators of extremism, made detectable false statements on their visa
applications, were pulled out of the travel stream and given greater
scrutiny by border officials, made false statements to border officials
to gain entry into the United States and violated immigration laws while
inside the United States. These circumstances offered opportunities to
intelligence and law enforcement officials but our government did not
fully exploit al Qaeda's travel vulnerabilities. Why weren't they
exploited?

We do not have all the answers. Certainly, neither the State
Department's consular officers nor the INS's inspectors and agents were
ever considered full partners in a national counterterrorism effort.
This is exemplified by the Bureau of Consular Affairs statement that
before 9/11 they were not informed by anyone in the State Department or
elsewhere that Saudi citizens could pose security risks. Nor were the
Consular Affairs Bureau or INS given the resources to perform an
expanded mission.

Between 1998 and 2001 visa applications rose by nearly a third, an
increase of 2.5 million per year. Trained staff did not keep pace with
the volume increase. In Jeddah and Riyadh, for example, each consular
officer had responsibility for processing on average about 30,000
applications per year and routinely interviewed about 200 people per
day.

The INS before 9/11 had about 2,000 agents for interior enforcement. As
long as the top enforcement priorities were removal of criminal aliens
and prosecution of employers who hired illegal aliens, a major
counterterrorism effort would not have been possible. This is not to
pass judgment on immigration policy generally. What we can do is
highlight those policy choices affected counterterrorism efforts before
9/11 and potentially affect them today. For our frontline border
inspection services to have taken a substantially more proactive role in
counterterrorism, their missions would have had to have been considered
integral to our national security strategy and given commensurate
resources.

Today the level of systematic effort by the intelligence community
focused on terrorist travel is much greater. But terrorist travel
intelligence is still seen as a niche effort, interesting for
specialists but not central to counterterrorism. Nor have policy makers
fully absorbed the information developed by terrorists' mobility
specialists. Much remains to be done within the United States and
internationally on travel and identity document security, penalties and
enforcement policy with respect to document fraud and travel documents
screening efforts at the borders.

If we have one conclusion from our work so far, it is that disrupting
terrorists' mobility globally is at least as important as disrupting
terrorist finance as an integral part of counterterrorism.

Thank you.

MR. KEAN: We will now hear from our first panel whose topic will be:
"The Border Security System Prior to September 11th." Our first witness
will be Ambassador Mary Ryan. Ambassador Ryan had a long and
distinguished career in the United States Foreign Service beginning in
1966. Twice the recipient of the Presidential Distinguished Service
Award, Ambassador Ryan served as assistant secretary of State for
Consular Affairs from May 1993 until July 2002.

Our second witness will be Doris Meissner. Ms. Meissner served the
United States government in immigration matters since the 1970s in
several capacities in the Department of Justice. In October 1993,
President Clinton appointed Ms. Meissner as INS commissioner. She served
in that capacity until November 2000. Ms. Meissner is currently the
senior associate at the Migration Policy Institute which she helped
found.

At the hearing today and at all future public hearings, the Commission
plans to put all witnesses under oath as authorized by section 605 of
our statute of public laws number 107 through 3006. So, if I could ask
the witnesses please to raise your right hand. Do you swear or affirm to
tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Thank you.

Ambassador Ryan.

MS. MARY A. RYAN: Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, thank you for
the opportunity to appear before you today to describe the role of the
Bureau of Consular Affairs of the Department of the State in our
nation's border security program. My remarks will cover the period from
May 1993 until July 2002, the years I served as assistant secretary for
Consular Affairs. I retired from the Department of State in late 2002
after 36 and-a-half years as a career foreign service officer, during
which I served eight presidents: Presidents Johnson, Nixon, Ford,
Carter, Reagan, Bush 41, Clinton and Bush 43.

In the limited time I have for this oral statement, I have three
objectives: to give you an overview of the automated consular system, to
correct a couple of misconceptions about how our processes work and I
also would like to outline for you the budgetary constraints on the
Department of State in the 1990s and how these constraints impacted the
Bureau of Consular Affairs. I will describe the improvements made to the
lookout systems that developed from microfiche in 1993 to the current
global system that we have today.

All these systems are designed to assist officers in visa adjudication
process, in evaluating whether or not to issue a visa to a foreign
applicant. The systems are the Consular Look-out and Support System, or
CLASS, TIPOFF, which is a system developed and managed in my time in CA
by the Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research. Visas
Viper was created in 1993 designed to obtain intelligence from our
embassies and consulates abroad as well as other agencies operating
abroad and the consolidated consular database which gives consular
officers replicated visa records of all visas issued and refused.

These systems contain the names of terrorists, criminal aliens and
others who should not be admitted to the United States. They give
consular officers real-time, online name checking capability. However,
if there is a single point that I want to leave with the Commission
today, it is that any lookout system is only as good as the intelligence
it contains and the Bureau of Consular Affairs had no intelligence on
any of the 19 terrorists.

In the 1990s, consular workload increased dramatically. Non-immigrant
visa applications rose from seven million in 1993 to 10 million in 2001.
We were also processing over 600,000 immigrant visa applications. U.S.
passport demand grew from 3.5 million in 1993 to seven million in the
same timeframe. State Department budgets were inadequate for this
workload. Because of the lack of funding, the department's senior
management determined not to hire to attrition and to reduce promotion
significantly into the Senior Foreign Service. These decisions had an
immediate and very negative effect on consular operations.

The department had generally maintained an intake of junior Foreign
Service officers of about 200 a year. In the mid-1990s, because of the
budget shortfalls, junior officer intake numbered one year 130, another
year 110 and another year 90. Because most of the entry level jobs in
the Foreign Service are consular, consular work was heavily impacted. A
huge hole was created at the bottom of the Service. At the same time,
senior officers were being forced out of the Service because they failed
to be promoted.

Thus simultaneously, there weren't enough junior consular officers and
there was also a shortage of top level consular management. Entry level
positions were filled through a variety of staffing mechanisms. But many
large sections faced a dearth of experienced supervisors to train more
junior staff. It was an extremely difficult period and one that lasted
well into the 1990s.

I would now like to describe for you the various lookout systems that
provide intelligence to consular officers in the field. In Fiscal Year
1994, Congress authorized the Department of State to charge a fee for
machine readable visa applications and to keep that money. That was the
first time in the department's history that we were allowed to keep a
fee that we collected. It was this funding that permitted the Bureau of
Consular Affairs to undertake the enhancements to our system.

CLASS is the consular lookout system. In 2001, CLASS contained 5.7
million records on aliens, most of which originated with the visa
application process at our consulates and embassies abroad. A variety of
federal agencies contribute names to this system. INS contributed over a
million records including the names of deported aliens. DEA contribute
over 300,000 and Customs some 20,000 from its serious drug violator
files. Consular Affairs, in turn, provided other agencies through the
Inter-Agency Border Inspection System over 500,000 lookout records.

TIPOFF is a border security and counterterrorism tool developed in 1987
and managed when I was in CA by the Bureau of Intelligence and Research
in the Department of State. It utilizes sensitive intelligence and law
enforcement information from the CIA, from the FBI and from NSA and
overseas posts concerning known or suspected terrorists and criminals.
TIPOFF's objective was to detect these individuals either as they apply
for visas or as they attempt to pass through U.S., Canadian or
Australian border entry posts. Data sharing was implemented with Canada
in 1997 and with Australia in 2000.

The Bureau of Consular Affairs provided over $7 million to help TIPOFF
between the years 1995 and 2001. The TIPOFF staff reviewed all
intelligence reports, overseas post cables and other sources of
information for the names and biographic data of known or suspected
terrorists that were then entered into CLASS and INS and Customs' IBIS
system, the Interagency Border and Inspection System.

In 2001, the CLASS database contained over 48,000 such records. Visas
Viper is an integral part of TIPOFF. Intelligence and law enforcement
agencies had been reluctant to share terrorist information at posts
where it was developed. However, they professed themselves comfortable
with providing this information through INR and through TIPOFF. Because
the Bureau of Consular Affairs was advised that intelligence was flowing
to the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, we believed that we were
getting all such intelligence that they had to protect our country. As I
noted earlier, even a state of the art system like ours is only as good
as the intelligence it has in it, and we had no intelligence on these 19
terrorists.

Finally, the Consolidated Consular Database is a globalized database of
visa records. All visa data collected abroad was being replicated to the
CCD, and by May of 2001, we were able to make the Consolidated Consular
Database available to all visa issuing posts. The photo and details of
all visa applicants, once only available locally to the post where the
application originated are now available in real time to all visa
offices worldwide. Visas can be checked at any point in the process
against all issued and refused visas worldwide, and consular management
in Washington now has access to up to the minute information about visas
around the world. By October 2001, INS was able to accept this
information and provided it to all the ports of entry. All of these
systems were designed to protect the United States from those who mean
us harm.

I'd like to address now some of the distortions that appeared in the
media after the attacks on our country about visa operations in Saudi
Arabia. In order to meet existing and new demands for visa services, and
in the absence of adequate financial and personnel resources, the Bureau
of Consular Affairs developed programs aimed at getting the work done as
efficiently and effectively as possible. One of these programs was
interview by exception, and was designed to concentrate scarce resources
on visa applicants that were problematic. We also developed a travel
agency referral program whereby carefully vetted travel agents could
submit applications for their clients, who generally would not be
interviewed. Variations of this program existed before my time in the
Bureau.

Validation studies were conducted to ensure that the clients did return
from visits to the United States, and agencies that violated any of the
rules, or whose clients overstayed in the United States, were dropped
from the program. The United States Embassy in Saudi Arabia developed
such a program in 2001, one of more than 30 posts with similar programs.
It was incorrectly alleged that travel agents were deputize to make visa
decisions when they obviously had a financial interest in seeing that
the visas were issued to their clients. Nothing could be further from
the truth.

We use such programs in countries with low refusal rates or where the
applicants had to travel long distances from their homes to our
embassies and consulates. In every case, the applications were checked
through CLASS, and CLASS is designed so that the visa cannot be printed
unless the system is checked, for any indication of a program and the
consular office was free to require the applicant to appear for an
interview and the policy was never to guarantee issuance.

MR. KEAN: Ambassador, if you could start to wrap up.

MS. RYAN: I'm sorry. We treated Saudis exactly the same as we treat all
nationalities who need visas from us. About 40 percent of our
international visitors enter the United States through the Visa Waiver
Program, and those people are not checked by State Department consular
officials. Everyone else is checked and checked carefully through CLASS,
through the databases.

To summarize, with all of these systems we need intelligence information
from the agencies designed to collect it. We had no such intelligence
information on any of the 19 terrorists.

Thank you for your attention.

MR. KEAN: Ms. Meissner.

MS. DORIS MEISSNER: Good morning, Mr. Chairman, members of the
Commission. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you. I hope
to be able to help in any way that I possibly can with the important
work that you're doing. As you noted in your introduction, I had served
in the Nixon, Carter, Ford and Reagan administrations, so brought some
experience to the position of commissioner when I entered on duty. I
came back in the Clinton administration, recognizing some of the
challenges that INS faces and committed to wide-ranging agency reform.

INS, as you know, has widely divergent areas of responsibility that had
suffered from a history of neglect by administrations and Congresses of
both parties. During my time at INS that began to change, as serious
attention was devoted to building the capabilities the agency needed to
carry out its mission effectively. At the same time, even under the best
immigration controls, most of the September 11 terrorists would still be
admitted to the United States today. That is because they had no
criminal records, no known terrorist connections, and had not been
identified by intelligence methods for special scrutiny.

The innovation al Qaeda introduced is clean operatives who can go
through immigration controls undetected. Immigration measures are an
important tool in the war against terrorism, but they are not effective
by themselves in identifying terrorists of this new type. The
immigration system can only set up gateways and tracking systems that
exclude terrorists about whom the United States has some information.
And it can enable authorities to find clean operatives already in the
country if new information is provided by intelligence agencies. The
immigration and the intelligence systems must work together for either
to be effective.

To that end, the lead domestic security responses to terrorism should be
strengthened intelligence and analysis, compatible information systems
and information sharing, and vigorous law enforcement and
investigations. Improved immigration controls and enforcement are
needed, and they can support good anti-terrorism enforcement, but they
are not enough by themselves.

Let me first give a brief overview of my tenure. With more than 10
million immigrants, the 1990s rank as one of the two decades of highest
immigration in American history. These numbers represent millions of
transactions daily, and those transactions were made by an agency that
suffered from chronic overwork, underfunding and outdated practices.
Early in 1993, three high profile immigration crises occurred in close
succession. They were the first bombing of the World Trade Center, the
multiple drownings when a Chinese smuggling ship washed ashore off Long
Island, and shootings outside the CIA headquarters that killed
government workers. All three involved people applying for political
asylum in the United States.

Beginning with fixing this broken asylum system, border control became
the highest priority for the new administration from the outset. During
my tenure, the INS budget grew from approximately $1.6 billion to $4
billion. Personnel grew from about 18,000 to 32,000. With growth at that
scale came enormous management demands. In addition, Congress enacted a
series of sweeping new laws, beginning in 1996, that placed ambitious
new mandates on INS. The 1996 act alone required writing more than 70
regulation sand training more than 20,000 staff. All generated
unplanned, sizeable new workloads.

Other major efforts that we faced included successive humanitarian
emergencies, such as Haitian and Cuban boatlifts, a tripling of
detention capacity, dramatic increases in the removal of criminal
aliens, and a citizenship backlog reduction program that foundered,
requiring top to bottom reforms that demanded attention for several
years. Overall, Congress supported the administration in providing
increased resources for INS and promoting new strategies and technology.
Still the public mood was one of growing anti-immigration sentiment. The
administration had basic immigration policy disagreements with Congress,
the relationship between INS and its congressional oversight committees
was often contentious.

Against that backdrop, let me summarize a few items of most relevance to
counterterrorism. First, border control. The broad goal that I set forth
for INS was to prevent illegal immigration and facilitate legal
immigration. Preventing illegal immigration incorporated all abuses of
the immigration system. We began with asylum reform, but we then
continued with border control as the agency's highest priority during my
entire tenure. Our definition of the nation's borders was comprehensive:
land borders with Mexico and Canada, our ports of entry and our
consulates abroad. The transformations that were the most visible
occurred along the southwest border. But INS's agenda always encompassed
a comprehensive view of our borders. That meant that ports of entry,
POEs, had to be a key element of border protection.

Among the most meaningful changes that we implemented in our port of
entry operations are inspector staffing increases, improvements to the
lookout system, data share efforts that Ambassador Ryan has described
with Consular Affairs, facilitation programs that created more secure
travel such as INSPASS, which was the first use of biometrics, SENTRY,
which is electronic dedicated commuter lanes at the border, an advanced
passenger information which is the sharing of manifests from airlines.
We were able to get 80 percent of airline passengers having been checked
before they arrived at our ports of entry in the United States. All of
these things are elaborated in more detail in my testimony.

These improvements have been significant. They have strengthened border
control and facilitation. But they all address issues of admitting
people to the country. There has never been systematic departure
controls from the United States. Without them, INS's knowledge of who
and how many people have left as required and who did not has been
incomplete. To meet this need, Congress called for an entry-exit system
in its 1996 legislation. INS designed, tested and implemented the front
end of such a system at certain airports but the major stumbling block
for entry-exit has been the land borders, a problem that remains
unresolved today.

Next to border control, technology was my highest priority. In 1993,
less than 20 percent of INS employees had access to any automation. When
I left, more than 95 percent had a terminal at their work station and
relied on automated information to carry out their tasks. The technology
projects beyond those that I have described that have a bearing on
counterterrorism include the following.

IDENT, this is the system that was created in 1994 for the southwest
border. It is the automated biometrics system that contains a photo and
two index finger fingerprints. The technology now meets many immigration
needs where identity must be verified for both enforcement and benefit
granting purposes.

New green cards and laser visas. In 1998, INS began replacing with a new
green card a technology that incorporated state-of-the-art security
features, including biometrics. The technology was also used to produce
laser visas which Consular Affairs issued to Mexican nationals. The
replacement program consolidated a large number of documents that INS
had historically issued and its purpose included reducing misuse and
counterfeiting of documents.

Foreign student tracking. In response to FBI concerns, INS proposed a
new student system in 1995. Congress mandated it in 1996. INS tested a
pilot in 1997 and '98 and was on track for implementation in 2003 as the
legislation required assuming that funding issues which were unresolved
could get resolved. These programs and other technology infusions
represented major improvements that INS badly needed to be effective.
But by the late 1990s, appropriations did not keep pace. Numerous
candidates for new systems development that could yield significant
continuing improvement had to be kept on hold.

Nevertheless, it's not databases that catch terrorists. Had student
tracking, for instance, been in place before 9/11, it's still highly
unlikely that the terrorist with a student visa who did not appear for
classes would have been arrested by INS. That's because it would take
far greater numbers of officers than INS has ever had to actually locate
and take custody of those who have overstayed or who have violated the
terms of their visas.

Instead, what good information systems can do is cultivate a culture of
compliance with our immigration requirements and they can provide very
useful information that law enforcement needs when following
investigative leads, including leads in counterterrorism investigations.

I see the yellow light is on, so let me say that there are other actions
that are, of course, outlined in my testimony. Among them are serious
refocusing of our interior enforcement which included focusing on
criminal matters that would have included terrorism and restructuring of
the INS which would have been a major effort which we presented to
Congress in 1998 and which included upgrading and including and
incorporating as law enforcement our activities at the ports of entry.
That too is an issue that still remains undone.

Let me conclude by saying that by 2000 INS had become a larger, better,
more professional agency especially in the areas of its most critical
responsibilities. Many of the changes were transformational. All
constituted critical building blocks for properly managing the
immigration system in the years ahead. But it is my strong conviction
that on the issues of counterterrorism, the agency's focus and record
were where they should have been. We understood that our role was to
have the systems and structures in place to prevent wrongdoers from
getting into the country.

We did that by pressing hard for strong comprehensive border controls,
modern information systems and interagency and international
coordination. The measures we took and the systems we put into place
would have identified the 9/11 terrorists, had INS known who to be
looking for. Moreover, the major technology and systemic improvements in
immigration control that have been made since 9/11 have been to fund and
give higher priority to the initiatives and the technology that we
developed.

Thank you very much.

MR. KEAN: Thank you, Ms. Meissner.

Our questioning today will be led by Commissioner Lehman.

MR. JOHN F. LEHMAN: Thank you. I'd like to begin with a question to
Ambassador Ryan. Ambassador, as you know, historically, the consulates
and the consular corps of the Department of State from the earliest days
of the republic have been the outer defenses, the global listening posts
and the first line of defense if you will. And the history certainly of
the first up to the Second World War was an elite professional consulate
professional corps. Yet, ironically, as our global involvement started
to expand rapidly after the war, the consular corps and consulates began
a long and steady decline, shrinking in numbers steadily, shrinking in
prestige, gradually becoming a kind of an orphan within the Department
of State.

And while I know during your tenure with things like the MRV program,
you did some very significant things to attempt to do more with less or,
as you said in one of your interviews, to do more with nothing. But I
remember one of the first State Department issues when I began in the
government back in the Nixon administration was the closing of a whole
range of consulates and consolidating. And then when I was secretary of
the Navy, I was deeply involved in a lot of skirmishing throughout my
tenure because the Navy is particularly dependent on consulates in ports
around the world and they were being closed at an even greater pace
during the Reagan years.

So my question to you is, while, I know and your testimony and your
statement outlines some important significant tactical efforts that you
made to fight what was essentially a rearguard battle against personnel
cuts and closings and so forth, could you give us an idea about what you
might have done or what should have been done to take a larger view to
look at the overall steady decline of which your particular tactical
problems were a part. And what was done to try to reverse this and to
reinvigorate the consular corps as a line of defense against terrorism
and, importantly, to get the resources because next to the Coast Guard
and INS, there probably is no other orphans who are underfunded
historically as the cone that you headed in State?

Were your obstacles a lack of recognition of the importance? Were they
budget cutting within the Department of State? Was it OMB or was it
principally the congressional appropriation that kept this inexorable
decline going even as the threat increased?

MS. RYAN: Mr. Secretary, we in the Bureau of Consular Affairs take our
responsibility -- when I was there, took the responsibility as the outer
ring of border security very, very seriously. We were faced with many of
the things that you describe. In the mid-90s the budgets were completely
inadequate, and this was before the MRV money, machine readable visa
money, began to really come in. We just got the authorization in FY '94.
We were charging at that time $20 per machine readable visa application,
but we did not have that technology worldwide.

So we didn't have a lot of money and so we were devastated by the budget
cuts. We were devastated by the lack of junior officer intake. I would
say that the people that we used in lieu of junior officers, who were
civil servants on excursion tours, they were specialists in other areas
of the department, and we also hired Foreign Service spouses to do this
work. They did a fantastic job. But the message that was sent by this to
the rest of the Department of State was that consular work was really
not that important, and it was the only cone -- if we call the
specializations cones -- the only cone where this occurred. All other
cones were staffed completely by Foreign Service officers.

So we had that problem. I would tell you, sir, that the high point of my
career was in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, serving with people in my
bureau, which is a primarily civil service bureau, and serving with
consular officers worldwide, because I really believe they're the finest
public servants in the government. They take their responsibilities
very, very seriously. As you heard from the staff, in Jeddah, for
example, they were interviewing 200 people a day. I interviewed 200
people a day 30 years ago when I was on Monterrey, Mexico. I can tell
you how hard that work is and how difficult it is, and how worn down you
are by the end of the day and how you always have people left over that
you were not able to reach to interview, even though you were working as
hard as you can. It's demoralizing work for consular officers.

But I would tell you, which I believe with all my heart, that they did
it to the best of their ability, that they love this country, that
they're patriots, that they chose government service not for the money
and not for the prestige, because neither exists in the government any
more, but they chose it because they love this country and they want to
serve our country and the American people. And I -- despite the fact
that these 19 people exploited our weaknesses, I believe that the
consular officers around the world and the consular officers who issued
to these people did their jobs to the best of their ability with the
knowledge and the tools that they had at the time.

MR. LEHMAN: But my question really is where was the problem? Why were
you the orphan? Was it prejudice within the department or an ignorance
within the department. Was it over at OMB that all the cutting went on?
Or was it in Congress? And did you -- I mean, the disparity between the
needs and the mandates you had and the resources you were given is so
gross that I would have expected you to be raising hell at each of these
three levels. Did you?

MS. RYAN: I did, sir. We have a program in the Department of State
called the Bureau Program Plan, which is a way that we try to match
resources and money. We did very good Bureau Program Plans that didn't
unfortunately get us the money that we needed. I believe that it was the
Congress in the mid-1990s that cut us. If you remember, in the mid-1990s
we had the furlough, because I believe that there were people in the
Congress who did not know that the U.S. government did anything that the
American people needed or wanted or couldn't get when we were closed.

MR. LEHMAN: And was this in foreign relations or in the appropriating
process?

MS. RYAN: It's in the appropriations process.

MR. LEHMAN: And did the Intelligence Committees have a say?

MS. RYAN: I don't know, sir, because we didn't ever testify before the
Intelligence Committee. I certainly didn't. We testified before the
Appropriations Committee. I testified before the Immigrations
Subcommittees of the House and Senate. We tried higher up than I in the
chain of command in the State Department, tried to get us the money that
we needed, tried to get the department the money that we needed. It
simply wasn't there. Congress had higher priorities or priorities that
they felt were more significant than funding the State Department.

MR. LEHMAN: Ms. Meissner, I'd like to ask you a similar question. You
said you got the budget up to $4 billion plus by the time you left, but
your successor has made a very good case, with various specifics, just
matching minimal funds to the mandates that Congress has provided, and
comes up with a figure 10 times that size. As a similar orphan in a
larger department, how did you raise hell and at which levels were your
biggest obstacle? Again, was it Congress, was it OMB and the White
House, or was it within your own cabinet department?

MS. MEISSNER: Well, Mr. Secretary, I think our circumstances during the
time that I was there were slightly different from a budget standpoint
because we were growing very, very rapidly. The difficulty with INS, of
course, was how fast could you grow? I mean, there were years that we
were growing 15, 20 percent a year and we didn't have the infrastructure
to handle the recruiting and the training and the deployment and the
space. So the difficulty that we had with funding was not so much in the
early years, support from either the Justice Department or the
administration or the Congress.

There was a consensus that the INS needed to grow. The difficulty was
that the Congress sometimes wanted the growth in different ways and in
different programs than the Administration proposed. And in key areas
such as technology, the funding really tapered at the time where we
needed it to keep expanding, because our workforce had expanded so
quickly that we were eating up the money just with operating the systems
that we had, and we were not able to continue the new systems
development that we needed in order to support the workforce.

Now, I've seen Commissioner Ziglar's testimony and I wish I had thought
of doing an analysis like that. It is entirely possible that INS needs
to be a $40 billion agency. I can't say independently anything about
that. I think that the most important thing for the growth of an agency
like INS is that it be steady and balanced and across the board.

Our problem was that the money and the Congress's desire for the money
was focused almost entirely on the southwest border, whereas the case
that we made and that the Justice Department and the administration
supported us on was for an across the board distribution of resources,
the areas that were not getting the money: technology, interior
enforcement, and the borders comprehensively, which is not simply the
southwest border but also our ports of entry and the kinds of data and
technology efforts that needed to take place as between us in Customs
and us in Consular Affairs, because this has to be a seamlessness. The
duties are divided among agencies but the people and the responsibility
for running the immigration system is cross-cutting.

MR. LEHMAN: In addition to being orphans, you both have in common the
fact that your agencies have a dual and some would say almost
incompatible mission. One is enforcement in each case, which is always
unpleasant. People don't smile when you enforce. And service, helping
travelers, facilitating air travel and so forth, helping citizens in
need abroad. And the criticism of both of the cultures of the agencies
you headed, and indeed to a certain extent of each of your tenures, has
been that enforcement was seriously neglected or de-emphasized, while
service and assistance and facilitation was greatly emphasized and that
they money flowed to the soft helping rather than the hard enforcing,
and specifically on really putting teeth into the denial of visas and
looking at Visa Express, for instance, looking at things like Transit
Without Visa that essentially the Consular Corps kind of thought this
was not really their business or much of a threat. That has come through
from a good deal of the interviewing we've done. Would you care to
comment on that, Ambassador?

MS. RYAN: Mr. Secretary, I would agree -- I would disagree with that
statement. I think that we did balance law enforcement and travel
facilitation. We poured what money we had into improving our lookout
systems with CLASS, with TIPOFF, with Visas Viper, all of which were
designed to get us the information that we needed to identify people
that we should keep out of the country. I don't think travel
facilitation and law enforcement are opposites. I think they're all part
of the whole scheme of things, as we were trying to do them.

Visa Express, which I agree -- I mean, I certainly wish that it had a
different name. It's a very unfortunate name because it makes people
think that we just issue visas --

MR. LEHMAN: Well, the problem is not that you issue visas, it's the fact
that some terrorists actually used it from third countries to get visas
that, had it not been in place, they would not have presumably been able
to get.

MS. RYAN: No, I don't think that that's really correct, because prior to
the time of Visa Express, most of the people in Saudi Arabia were not
interviewed. What happened was that they would come -- this was pre-Visa
Express. They would come in the mornings and they would make their
application, they would drop off their passports with the application.
They would come back in the afternoon to pick up their passports. Thus
there was -- the waiting rooms in both Riyadh and Jeddah were
insufficient for the numbers of people who were applying for visas. And
so there was a great deal of milling around outside of the embassy, both
in the morning and the afternoon, which was of great concern to the
regional security officers at both posts because, you know, in 2001 we
were having intelligence information that there were threats against our
interests in Saudi Arabia, and in fact, in July of 2001 we put out a
travel warning on the Arabian Peninsula because the threats that we were
hearing were so great.

So I don't think that Visa Express changed anything except that a third
party now received the passports and submitted them to us, and
eliminated the crowds at the embassy and at the consulate. The systems
-- the consular systems staff, which developed CLASS when we had the
money through MRV fees, developed it so that you could not print a visa
without checking the system. There was no override to that at all. You
had to check the system so that a consular officer, no matter how busy
or overworked or tired or whatever they were, there was no way that they
could issue a visa without checking the name -- the lookout system,
CLASS.

So I think that knowing certainly what we did in Consular Affairs, prior
to September 11th, 2001, we did -- we took every step that we could to
enforce the law and to be polite.

MR. LEHMAN: I would respectfully disagree with you. I don't think the
record shows that at all. In some of the interviewing of some of your
officials that were doing the actual consular functions in Saudi Arabia
at the time, they said in so many words, gosh, if we only knew. If
someone had told us that Saudi Arabia was a threat. We thought that they
were our friends and all we were looking for were people who were trying
to immigrate and we weren't looking for terrorists. Well, hello. I mean,
did anybody read the newspapers? I mean, there were books.

The literature was rife with, you know, books like "Among the Believers"
that catalogued this tremendous proselytizing of hatred and of
fundamentalism around the world, sourced in Saudi Arabia, with many
Saudi Arabian institutions and clerics the source of it. Yet everybody
that we talked to said, "Oh, well, Saudi Arabia," as they issued visas,
"Saudi Arabia is our friend so we don't look for terrorists here. Maybe
somewhere else like Pakistan," which is the point I was making with one
of the terrorists, who applied for a visa through -- thanks to the
changes that were made with Visa Express, from a third country that
never would have -- he would have gotten much different scrutiny, had he
not done it into Saudi Arabia. So that is -- I don't think the record
supports your view.

MS. RYAN: Before September 11th, and I think even after September 11th,
until now, I think that this government, our government, does regard
Saudi Arabia as an ally. In the current issue of Foreign Affairs, the
deputy secretary says that we have every confidence in the crown prince
of Saudi Arabia to carry out the reforms that he's trying to carry out.
I mean, that doesn't sound like we regard Saudi Arabia as a state
sponsor of terrorism. It was never so identified before September 11th,
it was never so identified after September 11th.

MR. LEHMAN: But did you only have robots that just take what the
official State Department characterization is? Don't they read the
papers? Don't they know that so much of the funding, so much of the
ideological motivation is sourced there? I mean, you know, in fact,
after the fact, as you clearly demonstrate and affirm, we were told by
consular officers that there was no change. They felt after the attack,
oh, gosh, we really screwed up. Fifteen of them were -- we gave visas to
15 of these guys, there are going to be some big reforms coming, and
nothing was ever done. Did you ever require -- did you call all hands in
for an offsite? Did your require after-action reports? Did you do a
lessons learned on how we're going to do things differently?

There was a reason why 15 of them were on Saudi passports, and that's
because the way you were doing business in Saudi -- I mean, you can
blame it on the official ostrich view of this Department of State
perhaps, but these were people that are supposed to have personal
judgment, education and ability to ask the right questions on their own,
regardless of what the secretary of State happens to be saying.

MS. RYAN: We were dependent on the intelligence of law enforcement
agencies to give us information on people that they believed we should
keep out of the country. I don't believe that in a visa interview you
would ever uncover a terrorist. We are dependent on the people whose job
it is to develop that kind of information. We set up all the consular
automated systems that we could, designed to get that information. And
the system was state of the art, is state of the art. It contains a lot
of names. These people were not known to intelligence or to law
enforcement. At least 17 of the 19 were not known at all. And even if we
interviewed everybody, I do not believe that we would have uncovered the
fact that they were terrorists.

MR. LEHMAN: I think our staff disagrees with that.

But, Ms. Meissner, I don't want to let you off the hook here. You, for
better or for worse, had a reputation in the -- during your tenure, and
we got this from a number of your subordinates, that there was a clear
culture of de-emphasizing enforcement. You deferred, you did not spend
the money that was appropriated on the student tracking system, the
biometrics for student tracking. There were stop work orders on it. It
was never fully implemented. You personally -- you told us during your
interviews that you personally opposed the entry-exit program that was
put in and even supported repeal of it. And so why this bias in both of
our frontline outer defenses against enforcement?

MS. MEISSNER: I have to disagree with that characterization. The
enforcement responsibilities of the INS have always been its primary
responsibilities. And I spent more time and effort on the enforcement
portfolio at INS than any other single thing. I did and do believe that
in order to enforce the immigration law properly and effectively, it has
to be done in a balanced way. In other words, the enforcement of the law
simply done along the southwest border by border patrol agents is not
sufficient. The entire agency's responsibilities have to be done in an
integrated and robust fashion.

The staff statement today is a good example in talking about foreign
student visas and applications for visa changes. If INS's backlogs were
up to date the way they should be, you wouldn't have to have the kinds
of regulations that allow people to come on a visitor visa and then
apply for a student visa because the application for student visa would
be timely and the information would be available and the regulations
that create the workarounds wouldn't be required. That kind of work is
considered facilitation work but it has an extremely important impact on
our ability to enforce the law properly.

Now, where student tracking is concerned and entry-exit are concerned,
my difficulties with those programs were not difficulties of the basic
concept. Student tracking in the first place did not have any funding
allocated for it. The way that student tracking was to take place was
through a fee which was described in the legislation which was to be
collected from the foreign student by the schools themselves. There was
a great deal of objection to that by the schools and by members of
Congress. And ultimately, that legislative formula was changed so that
the fee was collected in a different way.

Notwithstanding that there was no budget for foreign student tracking,
we took funds, $10 million as the staff statement describes, from other
automation projects in order to design a pilot and test a pilot along
the timetable that was set out in the legislation. So what we did was
work on parallel tracks. We moved ahead with the automation planning
just as we were advocating and working with the Congress on a
legislative change that would make the funding mechanism be a more
sensible one and one that all the stakeholders could live with.

Similarly, on entry-exit. On entry-exit, the timetable that was set up
in the legislation was absolutely undoable. They were calling for, in
the 1996 law, an entry-exit program to be in place by 1998. That could
not happen. As I explained, we have never had departure controls from
this country. We went ahead and designed what the front end of a system
for entry-exit could be, again working on a parallel track with the
Congress to try to change the timetable in the legislation so that there
would be the opportunity to design the kind of a system that could
actually work.

In fact, on entry-exit, we -- INS itself very early in my tenure made a
very big effort to publish research that showed that 40 percent of the
people in the United States who were here in an illegal status were
here, not because they had come improperly across the southwest border,
but because they had overstayed a visa and that the effort to deal with
illegal migration to the United States had to be one that dealt with
ports of entry and with overstays just as it dealt with southwest border
circumstances.

But an entry-exit system is a massive system to put into place and it
continues to be a problem even with the high priority that is now being
given to it since September 11 because we don't have the highway
systems, we don't have the set-ups in our airports to physically handle
people checking out when they leave the country. So I think that there
-- I don't doubt that people that were in the INS have told you what
they did and mistook -- you know, were mistaken or misunderstood what it
is that I was trying to do. But what it is that I was trying to do was
put a balanced system into place so that the parts actually could work
effectively on both the facilitation and the enforcement side because
they are mutually supporting. They are not contradictory.

MR. LEHMAN: Thank you. I have one final question and, if you could keep
your answers brief, we're running a little over time. There was a famous
quote, when the Berlin Wall fell, from an East German worker that said,
"You know, our system was based on the state pretending to pay us and we
pretended to work." It's my belief that what has been revealed in our
investigations is that Congress and a succession of administrations
pretended to want enforcement of immigration law and your two agencies
pretended to try to enforce it.

The gap between the stated purpose of immigration law and the execution
is so vast that it makes a farce of the whole concept of rule of law.
And so, for instance, today there's still -- before 9/11 there were only
2,000 interior enforcers in the immigration function. As you rightly
complain, how can you go check students overstaying their visas with
only 2,000 people. Today, there is still only 2,000 people. So
enforcement, not everybody really wants illegals put under a rule of law
and that's a huge hypocrisy.

So, with that preamble, could you each of you give us, in 25 words or
less, your recommendation on how to fix this lamentable situation?

MS. RYAN: I would say, Mr. Secretary, there was no pretence on the part
of consular officers, either in Washington or abroad, on enforcing our
immigration laws. It's up to the Administration and to the American
people to decide what kind of immigration laws they want. I think that
this country cries out for immigration reform but I can assure you that
consular officers take their responsibilities to enforce the law very,
very seriously. They do the best they can with the tools they have and I
think it's an unfair characterization to say that they were pretending
to enforce the law.

MS. MEISSNER: I would say that, as a country, we are ambivalent and
always have been ambivalent about what we want out of our immigration
system and out of our immigration policy. Immigration is an area that
has -- the pendulum has swung widely back and forth over history as
between tough enforcement, exclusion, discriminatory policies and very
permissive, lax approaches when it serves our interest. And that remains
unsettled. That's very different, however, from being in the agency and
having a set of specific responsibilities and people whose work you
direct on a day-to-day basis. And where that is concerned, I certainly
must say that during my tenure we made every possible effort to
rationalize the system and the political ambivalence that continues
today.

MR. LEHMAN: Thank you very much.

MR. KEAN: Senator Gorton.

MR. SLADE GORTON: Ms. Meissner, you have, I think, quite eloquently
outlined dramatic changes in INS and, in contrast with Ms. Ryan, at
least increasing resources with which to carry out its functions. But,
looking at it today, would you tell me your one or perhaps two highest
priorities for additional change with an emphasis on what those changes
would do to better control or add a greater ability to control
terrorism, which is the function of this commission? Let's say, what two
changes that are realistically possible would provide the greatest
degree of improvement in meeting that mandate?

MS. MEISSNER: Absolutely and thank you. The two changes that I believe
are the most critical are, number one, integrated information databases
that talk to each other. You now have immigration functions divided up,
fragmented within the Department of Homeland Security and you do not
have an immigration history for every person that comes to the United
States or is in the United States. Those databases do not talk to each
other. So not only do you need to continue to invest in the kind of
technology that gives you a good foreign student tracking system and
exit-entry and so forth, but those that somebody, an immigration officer
or a consular officer must be able to click into a computer and on a
particular person know everything, be able to get to everything that the
U.S. government knows about that individual. That is not the case right
now. That should have the absolute highest order of importance. It's the
connective tissue that is missing now with the way that the
restructuring of the immigration function has taken place.

The second thing is the kind of interagency coordination between the
frontline agencies and the intelligence community that was suggested in
the staff statement. The frontline agencies are Consular Affairs, the
new immigration bureaus, the Customs officers, the Department of
Agriculture, those entities that are in what we used to call -- we're in
retail -- we've got to open the store every day. And the upstairs
agencies, the back room agencies, the FBI, the CIA, the intelligence
community, there has to be the trust and the information sharing that
allows those frontline officers to do their job in identifying
wrongdoers.

MR. GORTON: So, if I can summarize, you're saying we need the technology
to do the job and then we need people who will actually do it.

MS. MEISSNER: Well -- and the relationships.

MR. GORTON: Between agencies. Ms. Ryan, you have retired from an agency
which was losing resources during much of your time of responsibility.
But, nonetheless, within the ambit of what the Department of State does,
what would be your two highest priorities?

MS. RYAN: I share Commissioner Meissner's concern about the integration
of databases. In, I think it was October of 2001, there was created what
was called the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force which was supposed
to merge all the databases in the government so that everyone had the
same information on everyone who was in the various databases. I
detailed an officer from the Visa Office to that task force to ensure
that the information that we got was information that we could use. I
mean, we can't just use a name. We have to have at least a country of
birth and an approximation of date of birth. Nothing ever happened with
that and it disappeared. It was disbanded.

Now there's a new terrorist screening center, something like that. I'm
not current on all of this because I am no longer in the government. But
that is the highest priority. I hope that this commission can break down
the stovepipes that exist between agencies of this government, one
agency having some information and another agency having some
information and perhaps another agency having no information. There has
to be integration of these databases so that we all know who the people
are that we want to keep out of this country.

The other thing that I think is desperately needed is -- I would argue
for increased consular staffing at posts abroad. Interviewing 200 people
a day, as we did 30 years ago, we should have advanced beyond that. We
should not be asking people to work like that. And then the third thing,
even though you didn't ask for a third thing, is that the
administration, the Congress, the people of this country have to decide
what they want in terms of immigration. Commissioner Meissner put it
very correctly. We are very ambivalent, as a nation, about immigration.
I don't think we can afford to be ambivalent anymore. I think we have to
decide what we want and then give the people who are charged with
carrying out that responsibility the tools that they need to do their
jobs.

MR. GORTON: I want to thank both of you for those cogent answers and
thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. KEAN: Commissioner Ben-Veniste.

MR. RICHARD BEN-VENISTE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My first question is
directed to Ms. Ryan. First, I want to express my personal gratitude for
your long service to the interests of this country and recognize the
difficulties under which you operated during the period most at issue
here. However, following up on Secretary Lehman's question and looking
at the fact that the terrorists were able to exploit a vulnerability
that they perceived in the system particularly with respect to Saudi
passports and visas, I see something of a disconnect in the situation as
you described it.

Here, in the summer of '01 and somewhat before, you have recognized that
a crowd control at the embassy or at the consular office, officers in
Saudi Arabia posed a problem because of the potential harm to
individuals from those who meant the United States and its interests
harm. If we take that just one step further, would you agree that the
individuals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who might pose such a threat
to cause harm to individuals at or about the embassy would be Saudis
rather than foreigners? Would you accept that?

MS. RYAN: That the people who mean us harm would be more likely to be
Saudis than --

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Yes. The people who you are talking about who posed a
threat to the numbers of individuals who were seeking visas in Saudi
Arabia must have been largely Saudis.

MS. RYAN: Yes, they were probably largely Saudis although there were a
lot of third country nationals in Saudi Arabia who also applied for
visas.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And I guess, on the issue of the disconnect, that
Secretary Lehman was talking about, once you acknowledge that there is
certainly a number of Saudis who might be in a position to do us harm
through violence against individuals at or near our consular offices, it
doesn't take a whole lot to go to the next step, even without specific
information from our intelligence agencies, that such individuals who
mean us harm might in fact wish to come to the United States. So the
notion, would you not agree, of Saudis not posing a particular threat
being taken out of that threat matrix really doesn't stand up even on
the basis of cursory information that you had available.

MS. RYAN: I'm not sure I'm following you, I'm sorry.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Saudis mean us harm in Saudi Arabia because they might
blow up the embassy or harm individuals in the vicinity of the embassy
but the Saudis who might seek entrance to the United States were not
considered a problem.

MS. RYAN: Of course, they were considered a problem. They required
visas. They were checked through our consular lookout systems. You know,
in the absence of information that someone is a threat to the nation, we
are dependent on the information that we have in our system developed by
intelligence and law enforcement agencies about people who mean us harm.
I don't imagine that -- I don't know but I can't imagine that you would
think that we could on the basis of the fact that some people might mean
us harm not issue visas to the entire nationality.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: I'm not suggesting that but that then begs the question
of the usefulness of individual face-to-face interviews during periods
of increased threat where there is some suggestion of potential
wrongdoers. And I think we'll hear next from a witness who makes that
point very explicitly. Let me turn to another issue which hasn't, I
think, been brought up to this point and that is the issue of the use of
interpreters by the consular service in the visa application process.

It has come to our attention from individuals who have had considerable
experience that there is a problem, and perhaps a widespread problem,
with respect to corrupt interpreters who are brought into the process
because consular officers often in certain countries do not have
language facility in the native language of that country. And therefore
the consular office must rely upon an interpreter to assist in the visa
application process and the interview process. Had it come to your
attention as of the time that you left the service that this was an
issue, and what, if anything, had been done during your tenure to try to
correct it?

MS. RYAN: This all goes back to the fact that we don't have enough staff
and enough money in the State Department. We recognize that it's a
tremendous advantage if officers, consular and otherwise speak the
language of the country and don't have to depend on interpreters. But we
don't have enough people to be able to put officers into language
training, long-term language training, which Arabic would be, or Chinese
or Russian or Korean or Japanese, because we've never had a person in
motion -- we've never had enough people to do that. And so that's always
a concern, that's always a worry that an interpreter might not be
interpreting accurately. It's one of the handicaps that the State
Department operates under.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Could I interrupt you for just a moment and ask you
whether rather in the theoretical you did not have some practical and
substantial information that in various places in the world for a
relatively small amount of money an interpreter could be bribed to
provide the answers that the consular officer needed to hear in order to
approve a visa.

MS. RYAN: I've never heard that about Saudi Arabia.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: I'm not limiting my question to Saudi Arabia. At many
places throughout the world you had not heard of such a problem?

MS. RYAN: If I remember correctly, there was a problem once at one post
that I knew of at the time where the interpreter was not interpreting
accurately, and a Foreign Service national, one of the locally engaged
staff, heard that and advised the officer. But that it's a widespread
problem, no, I'm not aware of that. I was not aware of that.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Commissioner Gorelick.

MS. JAMIE S. GORELICK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Ambassador Ryan, after 9/11 did you order an after-action report to
determine how and in what circumstances the hijackers got into this
country?

MS. RYAN: I sent a retired senior Foreign Service officer to Saudi
Arabia to look at the operations of the consular sections in both Riyadh
and Jeddah, and he advised me that they had followed all the procedures
that we had in place at the time. In other words, no one didn't follow
the way visas should be adjudicated, that they adjudicated the visas
correctly, that we lacked information.

MS. GORELICK: Did he make a written report to you?

MS. RYAN: Yes, I believe he did. I think he made a written report, which
should be available to the Commission.

MS. GORELICK: Thank you. The biggest inconsistency on the face of it
between the staff statement and your view of the efficacy of interviews
is what I understand you to be saying, is if these names had been in the
system, we would have found these people and prevented them from getting
visas, because the name would have been in the system. And I take your
point. But then the question is would you have found out anything had
you interviewed them? Now, I thought you said that you did not think an
interview of the sort that is contemplated in the visa process would
determine or provoke a question whether someone was a terrorist. Was
that your testimony?

MS. RYAN: Yes. In the type of visa interview that we were doing when I
was in the Bureau of Consular Affairs, it's not a law enforcement kind
of interview, it's just an interview -- what we were basically trying to
get at was whether the person was likely to remain in the country, in
our country, illegally after his proposed visit to the United States. If
you're doing 200 interviews a day, you can't spend a lot of time in an
interview. And what you ask is where are they going to go and whom do
they know and, you know, why they want to go.

We always interviewed first-time students because we wanted to ensure
that their English was sufficient to be able to undertake the course of
study that they were planning to take and that their previous study in
their own country had been of the type of study that would lead to
higher education in the United States. It was a very cursory interview.
There's also a body of thinking that the interpersonal interaction that
you have with the applicant makes it harder to refuse the applicant
because you get to know him or her a little bit by your questioning. So
I think it will be very instructive now that so many more people are
being interviewed since September 11th, once we have enough information
about these interviews to see whether the interview alone will be able
to detect a terrorist.

MS. GORELICK: But certainly there is a statutory obligation to assess
the visa applicant not just for whether they intend to violate in terms
of their visa and stay here illegally or inappropriately but also to
keep out terrorists. Now, the staff points out pieces of information
which either were omitted from the visa application or which presented
inconsistencies with data that were not on the face of the visa
application but which were accessible somewhere in the U.S. government.
And my question to you is whether, had the interviewers, the consular
officers, who had these materials in front of them, had had access to
that additional information, whether in that circumstance your view is
that the interviews could not have produced a negative response to the
visa application? Because you seem to be saying -- and I understand why
you might be saying it, but you seem to be saying that really unless the
name is in the computer, the interview element of our scrutiny is really
not meaningful, and I'm trying to probe that.

MS. RYAN: I think that it's unlikely that we would detect a terrorist in
an interview, in a straightforward interview. There is a question on the
visa application form which asks the applicant whether he or she belongs
to a terrorist organization, and they always say no. You know, if they
understand the question they always say no. So, I mean, asking that kind
of a question in an interview, I mean, I think you would most likely get
the answer, no, I'm not a terrorist. I mean, I don't see how in the
interview process, as it was pre-9/11/2001, we would be able to have
detected these terrorists. I will never know. None of us will ever know.

MS. GORELICK: Well, let me just ask one follow-up question then. Can you
imagine an interview process consistent with the nature of the
processing that you've got to do with however many large numbers of
people a consular officer has to interview, can you imagine an interview
process which would have efficacy in preventing terrorists from entering
the country?

MS. RYAN: It would have to be a completely different interview process
from the one that was before September 11th. It would have to be a much
lengthier interview process. It's conceivable that in a much more law
enforcement kind of interview you would detect a terrorist, but that's
something that, you know, is for the administration and the Congress and
the people to decide, whether that's the kind of interviewing that we
want. It's a risk management issue and that's up to people who make our
laws to decide that.

MS. GORELICK: Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Commissioner Roemer.

MR. TIMOTHY J. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I want to start with just a couple questions to Mary Ryan, and
appreciate your attendance here at our hearing this morning. Certainly
it seems that there are a couple of consistent themes from the post-9/11
analysis of the attacks on our country on September the 11th, 2001 that
both the Joint Inquiry of Congress and the 9/11 Commission today have
concluded that the Consular Affairs offices and our INS border were not
integral parts of the strategy and included in the key meetings to fight
the war on terrorism prior to 9/11. Would you agree with that?

MS. RYAN: No, sir. I think we always regarded ourselves as the outer
ring of border security, with all that that means. Our responsibility
was to protect the country, as well as to facilitate travel.

MR. ROEMER: Well, that was not the question, Ms. Ryan. The question was,
and due to your testimony here and the interviews that you conducted
with our staff, you talk about -- in the interview on 9/29/03, you say
that you had no direct contact with anyone in the FBI prior to 9/11.

MS. RYAN: That's right.

MR. ROEMER: Now, that seems to me that you were not integrally part of a
national security apparatus to catch and detain terrorists that may be
coming into our country, especially as our system, as you've noted in
your testimony, has resource problems, has problems with contacts with
the FBI, has problems communicating or not communicating through
stovepipes, yet al Qaeda makes travel one of their highest priorities,
maybe even higher than financing. So there doesn't seem to me to be the
commensurate allocation of emphasis between our government adjusting to
what al Qaeda is just about to do or planning to do throughout the 1990s
and our response. Now, you say that we had no knowledge that any of the
19 terrorists were -- we had information on them. How do we expect to
have information on them if you have no contact with the FBI?

MS. RYAN: We were dependent on the FBI's providing information to us
through TIPOFF and through Visas Viper if they had any information.

MR. ROEMER: And how would you characterize their ability to provide that
information to the TIPOFF program prior to 9/11?

MS. RYAN: I thought prior to 9/11 that they had the capability and that
they knew about people who were -- who meant us harm. I learned after
September 11th that they didn't have information and that they didn't
know about people who mean us harm.

MR. ROEMER: Would it surprise you, Ms. Ryan, to learn that there were
more people in 2001 recommended for the TIPOFF list from the press and
from a foreign government than from the FBI?

MS. RYAN: Yes, it would surprise me.

MR. ROEMER: It would surprise you. Would it surprise you, according to
our staff, that the FBI did not have a written policy on the TIPOFF
program for recommending people for that list prior to 9/11?

MS. RYAN: When we set up the Visas Viper program in 1993, we wanted the
information that was developed at post to be given to us at post for
inclusion in our system. And both the intelligence and law enforcement
agencies were very reluctant to give us the information at post because
consular sections are unclassified environments, and they were concerned
about protection of sources and methods. They said that they were
comfortable with providing the information through the intelligence and
research bureau, which would then put it into TIPOFF. I believed them.

MR. ROEMER: Okay. Well, you believed them, but in an interview with the
9/11 Commission staff, you say that you were outraged when you learned
that government agencies knew things, that two hijackers had this
information and it was never passed onto the TIPOFF program until they
already had their visas. Now, outraged seems to me not gravely
disappointed, not very upset, outraged seems to me that you're
indicating that mistakes were made, that terrible communication failures
were part of this.

MS. RYAN: Yes, sir. That's correct.

MR. ROEMER: And please elaborate. We need to fix this problem as well.
And from your further interviews with the 9/11 --

MS. RYAN: I'm not sure how --

MR. ROEMER: Excuse me. With your further interviews with the 9/11
Commission staff, you go on to say that you don't think that this
problem has been solved in subsequent meetings post-9/11 with the FBI.

MS. RYAN: Shortly after September 11th, my senior staff and I met with
the senior staff and the DCI, Mr. Tenet, and at that meeting we were
told that the CIA had passed information on two of the terrorists to the
FBI in January of 2000.

MR. ROEMER: Ms. Ryan, is this the meeting with George Tenet, Cofer
Black, George Lannon, Ken Duncan, Wayne Griffith and others?

MS. RYAN: Yes, sir.

MR. ROEMER: Okay. Thank you.

MS. RYAN: It was at that meeting that we learned that there was
information in the hands of parts of our government on two of the
terrorists that was never given to the Bureau of Consular Affairs, never
given to INR, to the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, for inclusion
into TIPOFF. So, yes, I was outraged. I was furious. I'm still angry
about it.

MR. ROEMER: And do you think that this fury and this outrage that you
express now -- are we going to feel the same way if something else
happens, if this problem hasn't been solved. "After the meeting,
however, Ryan said Consular Affairs got more information from the CIA
but nothing more from the FBI." That's your interview.

MS. RYAN: We got --

MR. ROEMER: This is post-9/11.

MS. RYAN: We got tremendous increase in information from the CIA. The
remedy that we sought to get the information from the FBI was from the
Congress. And included in the PATRIOT Act was the requirement that the
FBI give us all of their NCIC-3 information. So we got an additional
eight million records of criminal aliens, terrorists, that the FBI had
that they had refused to give us without the legislation because we were
not a law enforcement agency.

MR. ROEMER: So finally, Ms. Ryan, how would you categorize the pre-9/11
relationship and exchange of information that you had with the FBI?

MS. RYAN: It was not sufficient.

MR. ROEMER: Enough to make you furious and outraged after 9/11?

MS. RYAN: Yes, sir.

MR. ROEMER: And how would you categorize the communication that you had
with the CIA pre-9/11?

MS. RYAN: I was --

MR. ROEMER: Outrage? Fury?

MS. RYAN: I said at one of the hearings in 2001 that I thought 9/11 was
the result of either a colossal intelligence failure or failure to share
information. I think now that it was both.

MR. ROEMER: So we don't have a stovepipe problem here, we have a steel
wall problem here prior to 9/11?

MS. RYAN: We certainly had problems getting information that we thought
we had, that we believed we had, that we needed to protect the country.
Now, there were 17 others that didn't come to anybody's attention, but
two were known about and those two we also should have known about.

MR. ROEMER: Finally, so my colleagues can ask some questions, you're
also quoted in one of your interviews as saying, quote, you "have no
recollection of having learned about Tenet's" -- that's the director of
the CIA -- "declaration of war in al Qaeda in 1998."

MS. RYAN: No, that's not correct. I knew --

MR. ROEMER: It's not right.

MS. RYAN: -- about the war on al Qaeda. Our embassies were blown up in
1998. I lost colleagues and friends in Nairobi.

MR. ROEMER: That wasn't my question. My question was not the war on al
Qaeda, it was the director of the CIA's declaration of war on al Qaeda.
Were you aware of his memo that was circulated at the CIA on the war, or
did you learn of that --

MS. RYAN: It was in the --

MR. ROEMER: -- through the newspapers and through the --

MS. RYAN: It was in the media that he had declared war on al Qaeda.

MR. ROEMER: So you read about the declaration in the media, not through
something that was circulated directly from Langley or from a government
document?

MS. RYAN: Not that I remember. Internally government, no. Not that I
remember.

MR. ROEMER: Thank you again, Ms. Ryan.

MS. RYAN: Thank you, sir.

MR. KEAN: Commissioner Fielding.

MR. FRED F. FIELDING: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I would like to ask both of you some questions about the student
tracking before we get off the subject. But following up on what
Commissioner Roemer asked you, Ambassador Ryan, historically, probably
from the first days of our republic, the visa process has been part of
the Department of State and it's had a long history. And you've had a
great deal of experience about it. You know, one of the things that
we're chartered to do is try to figure out not only what mistakes were
made but how to correct the mistakes of the past. Let me ask you what
seems like a pretty basic question. Should the visa processing still
remain in the Department of State?

MS. RYAN: Yes, sir. I think so. I'm very biased about the offices in the
State Department. I think that the people who work in the State
Department are the finest public servants in the U.S. government today,
and so I don't think that moving visas to another agency is the answer.
I think strengthening the information and the intelligence that visa
officers have, giving them more tools, giving them more staff, more
money, those are all requirements. But I would hate to see, you know,
moving people around just to do something, to make the American people
think that they're safer. I don't believe that they would be any safer
by moving it to another agency.

MR. FIELDING: Of course, I'm not questioning the individuals themselves
at this juncture. I'm just questioning the functionality of this and the
duplicative nature of some of the problems that we run into all the
time. And so if -- it's not to move it away from State and it's not to
move it away from certain people that are doing it. What I was really
asking is, is it better served and better integrated into our system by
moving it elsewhere?

MS. RYAN: I don't think so, sir, no.

MR. FIELDING: Thank you. Let me go to my original quick line of
questioning on student tracking. Ms. Meissner, you testified that, even
if the student tracking system had been in place pre-9/11, I understand
your testimony is that it's very unlikely that there would be any arrest
or that anybody would have picked up someone who had overstayed or had
not even attended classes because there is a shortage of staff. Am I
correct in understanding?

MS. MEISSNER: That's correct.

MR. FIELDING: If there are not enough agents available, would you have
any suggestions to provide to us as to how we could involve the
education community into assisting the government in this regard, either
by carrot or stick, by sanction if they don't or by incentive to do so?
Anything in that regard?

MS. MEISSNER: I think that the education community since September 11th
does understand that it's an integral part of this element of
immigration control. The problem with people who fall out of status or
don't show up for classes, I think, is one where you have to essentially
do triage in terms of -- or think of it that way in terms of your actual
ability to arrest those people. My own sense is that, if we had a better
idea of who, not by names, but of a profile of the types of individuals
among the foreign student population that might be of highest concern
for national security purposes that you could start there.

MR. FIELDING: If I may interrupt you for a moment, I mean, triage
presumes that you can't do everything at once so therefore -- but, of
course, we're letting these people in so we control the numbers of this.
But I guess what I'm really looking at is you don't need a profile if
somebody doesn't show up for class.

MS. MEISSNER: But, let's say, you have about 500,000 foreign students.
So class starts presumably some time during the first two weeks in
September. Even if you know how many people haven't turned up in those
two weeks, even if it's one half of one percent, it's -- let me do the
math -- it's thousands of people. So then the question is, even if you
had many more thousands of investigators to check that out, where would
you go first? That's what I mean by triage.

You, it seems to me, have to do one of two things. You either have to
have a very well developed random check kind of a program where whoever
doesn't turn up for class, phalanxes of people go out and have the
information in the data system of their addresses and find them. If they
didn't turn up for class, their address in that data system may very
well not be current. So right there, you have another set of things that
have to happen.

Or you have a good idea of who the most likely problem students are.
They're either people that are studying certain very sensitive subjects.
They are people that are in trade schools rather than in graduate
schools. They are people who come from a particular country or from a
particular set of countries, are studying certain fields and, you know,
have prior visa problems. Something that gives you, that narrows the
field.

But I would have to tell you that I don't think that the thinking has
advanced any further than that on how you would do this even, as I say,
if you did have the thousands of investigators because you've got to get
to the point where you have some sense of what the threat is. That kind
of communication and that kind of analysis has not taken place in the
past and my understanding is that it's not taking place today.

MR. FIELDING: Not to beat this into the ground but what role does the
university play? What role does the school play? There's a lot of fraud
out there and we know it.

MS. MEISSNER: I am assuming that the university is doing its job of
reporting the data because the only way that you know who didn't turn up
for class is that the university told you who didn't turn up for class
through the data system. Now, you know, the suggestion -- the
implication of your question is that you also have to have an ongoing
monitoring effort of the universities because they are not a
one-size-fits-all. Most of them are very conscientious, some of them are
not and that monitoring will have be a parallel effort.

MR. FIELDING: That's for sure. That's something we will have to address.

Ambassador Ryan, on the same subject, in your interview, you were aware
of this issue and discussed this issue with our staff but you also noted
that there had been a lot of opposition from the education community to
the imposition of this tracking system in years past. Is that correct?

MS. RYAN: Yes, sir. That was pre-9/11 of course.

MR. FIELDING: I understand that. But could you give us some idea of that
history, please?

MS. RYAN: Well, as I remember it, when we were talking, we at the INS,
about how to set up what is now called SEVIS, the student tracking
system, the universities were -- at least the universities that made
their opinions or positions known -- were very opposed to it. They were
concerned about issues of academic freedom. They were concerned about
the fact that they would be reporting on students to the government.
They were also concerned about the fact that there would be a fee
involved that the student would have to pay and that we were expecting
the universities to collect that fee and they didn't want to do that.
Those were what I remember. But again, this was before September 11th.

MR. FIELDING: Is that problem solved now? Either of you, I'd be curious
for your answers.

MS. RYAN: I mean, there may still be philosophical objections but it's
-- you know, the door is closed.

MR. FIELDING: It's no longer as influential?

MS. RYAN: It's no longer for debate.

MS. MEISSNER: I think one thing that might help you in understanding
this is that this -- because I would agree with Ambassador Ryan's
characterization of the debate that was taking place during that time.
There was a debate not only of concerns expressed by the schools. There
was a strong feeling among some in the Congress that was similar and
there was a lot of conversation that took place between the government
agencies and members of committees and others about how intrusive a
system like this would be and whether it was appropriate.

One of the things that happened with this particular issue is that it
was put into the legislation in 1996 at the last moment in quite a
closed setting and there had been no hearings. There had been no public
debate so that it was the kind of a situation where once the legislation
passed, you had the debate that typically happens before legislation
passes when some of these things start to get sorted out and that was
the environment that we were working in.

MR. FIELDING: Okay, thank you. Thank you both. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. KEAN: Thank you. I have one question. We saw in the staff statement
-- I actually saw it in the video of something called The Red Book --
and the language sounded very much like something we would want to do
today. I mean, people were being alerted very strongly to the threat of
terrorism in this country and people were being told, "Watch out for
these people." What happened to the Red Book and did anybody ever
consider bringing it back?

MS. MEISSNER: I didn't see the video and I don't -- it doesn't ring a
bell.

MS. RYAN: I was here for the video. I had not heard of the Red Book
before today. The Office of Fraud Prevention programs within the Bureau
of Consular Affairs tried to do something similar in terms of training,
showing officers examples of fraudulent passports or fraudulent visas or
fraudulent stamps in passports, in foreign passports. One of the reasons
why we developed the database of lost and stolen passports that we did
develop, but I had not heard of the Red Book and I think it would be a
very good idea to have something like that where people are trained to
identify all the kinds of passports, stamps, visas that might exist and
that might be fraudulently used.

MR. KEAN: Thank you.

Commissioner Lehman?

MR. LEHMAN: Yes. There are two huge loopholes in enforcement that I'd
like to get both of your views on. One of them has been temporarily
suspended, the other is politically correct even to mention. Transit
Without Visa is one that has been temporarily suspended, in both of
these loopholes we know that terrorists have used them and we must
assume they'll continue to use them in the future if they remain.

Transit Without Visa is -- seems to be based on the fact that the
airlines say, well we don't have any secure transit lounges and so
therefore we need this system which is a form of additional revenue for
them. Your former employees in INS say that they have been trying for 10
years to get this stopped but they've been blocked by airline lobbyists
at every turn. In fact it was only suspended last August, nearly two
years after the fact.

The other huge loophole is the sanctuary system. Deep cynicism has been
expressed to us by immigration enforcement officers about the fact that
New York City, L.A. and a number of other cities in -- Florida as an
example, prohibit their enforcement officials from cooperating with
Immigration. So much so that while the Commission was at Kennedy, a
group of illegals managed to get past Immigration and Customs and were
waiting in the terminal quite visibly, but the INS or the security
people said they can't, they're not allowed to go past the Customs Hall
and the Port Authority Police are not allowed to enforce federal laws on
immigration.

One would seem that both of these sort of cry out for a little bit of
attention. Did either of you cry out against either of these huge
loopholes that terrorists were using?

MS. MEISSNER: Well, let me begin with the Transit Without Visa. I think
the Transit Without Visa, the way that you characterize that is -- I
couldn't disagree with that. It is now, you know, as you say suspended,
I don't know whether it should stay suspended or what. Obviously the way
that it is a loophole needs to be addressed and I don't know whether the
best way to do that is by maintaining this suspension of the Transit
Without Visa or combining that and/or with a much more careful look as
airports are being redesigned to be sure that, indeed there are secure
lounges. Which ever way it's done, you know, we want to be certain, you
know, that this is not -- this doesn't become a loophole again in the
future as attention, you know, wanes.

And that is part of, you know, what I refer to as this pendulum problem
that we have. We have a very difficult time just maintaining a steady
course on these issues. So that would be one where it would be very
important to maintain a steady course which is close the loophole
whichever way is the appropriate way to do it.

Now, on state and local law enforcement, state and local law enforcement
and its cooperation with federal law enforcement is a long standing
issue in immigration and, you know, in other fields of law enforcement
as well. But there is a real line between federal authority and federal
expertise and responsibility to enforce the immigration law, and the
responsibilities of state and local law enforcement. Now, you can
resolve and work with that by good liaison and good cooperation, but
that doesn't always exist.

So I think, you know, as far as I'm concerned the answer here is that
the federal government has to take the lead in being absolutely certain
that the working relationships are such that state and local law
enforcement understands what's taking place, but the airport authorities
according to the kind of a, you know, scenario that you're describing
are also involved because people like that shouldn't be able to leave
the customs area so that it even becomes a problem for state and local
law enforcement. That just sounds to me like a kind of a breakdown that
can be solved administratively that does not -- I'm not sure that it
requires --

MR. LEHMAN: It's a little hard because the cities that I'm talking about
actually have written laws against cooperation.

MS. MEISSNER: And those originated -- I mean some of those have been
around for a very long time. It traditionally -- it has not been state
and local responsibility, this is federal responsibility and it should
be done properly by the federal government.

MR. LEHMAN: How about treason? They shouldn't enforce treason either or
selectively choose the ones they feel like enforcing? Is that the rule
of law?

MS. MEISSNER: Well, but -- no, state and local governments don't have
the responsibility to enforce immigration law. Federal government should
do it.

MR. LEHMAN: I mean, that is the most preposterous statement I think I've
heard all morning.

MS. MEISSNER: Well then, maybe I'm not understanding --

MR. LEHMAN: That local police don't have to enforce federal laws, and
indeed it's quite all right to have them prohibited from enforcing
federal laws?

MS. MEISSNER: I'm not sure that they've passed -- my understanding is
that what they have said is that they will not -- they will not enforce
immigration law and they will not work with federal authorities to do
so. I mean, is it your information that that continues to be the case,
post September 11th?

MR. LEHMAN: Absolutely. It was just reaffirmed in New York about three
months ago. And nothing's been done by the federal government. I mean,
they just say, oh well, okay.

MS. MEISSNER: Well --

MR. LEHMAN: I haven't seen any injunctions or court orders or cutting
off of funds or whatever.

MS. MEISSNER: Well, what I can tell you is that we made a very
aggressive effort during the time that I was at INS to make information
available to state and local law enforcement so that they could
determine whether they had somebody who was of interest to the federal
government. We established a law -- what was called a law enforcement
support center, which was an automated information resource so that --
24/7 so that state and local law enforcement could get help from the
federal government and information from the federal government. We felt
that that was the proper way for the two sets of authorities to work
together, and I think that -- I would still stand by that being a proper
way and those relationships need to be --

MR. LEHMAN: Service rather than enforcement?

MS. MEISSNER: That's not a contradiction, that is communication and
coordination and each law enforcement authority exercising its
authorities in the way that it's been trained to do.

MR. LEHMAN: And Ambassador Ryan, did Consular ever get involved in these
issues?

MS. RYAN: Not in the sanctuary issue. Transit Without Visa, I would
agree with Commissioner Meissner that it is -- it was a problem. I think
that the suspension is a good idea, probably should be made permanent.
Before September 11th, one of the reasons why it was one of the rules
that allowed people to do this was because airlines, American Airlines
profited from people coming to the United States to transit the United
States to go somewhere else. And that was always the reason why we were
told that, you know, it was something that was just going to have to
continue. If one could be sure that the airports had secure transit
lounges --

MR. LEHMAN: Like every other country in the world?

MS. RYAN: Like every other country in the world, or most other countries
in the world, then I think you could have an effective Transit Without
Visa program, but I don't think that all of our airports have such
secure transit lounges, and so then it becomes a problem that people
could come to the United States and get out of the transit lounge and
just disappear into the country.

MR. LEHMAN: Thank you both for your honesty and frankness on those.

MS. RYAN: Thank you, sir.

MR. KEAN: Thank you, this has been a very, very useful discussion.

MR. KERREY: Mr. Chairman, I've got a couple of questions down here.

MR. KEAN: I'm sorry, I didn't know, Senator Kerrey.

MR. KERREY: Well, I just came on board, so. Well, John, I can tell you
Doris Meissner and I got to know each other very well when I was
representing the state of Nebraska and there were a lot of business
interests that did not want to enforce the law when it came to people
working in meat packing plants in the States. I know that she was
constantly running against people who did in fact put pressure on her
not to enforce the law, and I'm encouraged that there has been a lot of
training going on with people trying to get them to understand that the
law needs to be enforced.

One of the areas of great interest to me is, what I think in a
remarkable democratic system such as the United States has, there is a
weakness in transition, a transitional weakness. We saw it in 1993 and
Ambassador Ryan, you span the full roughly nine year period when there
were two transitions. In 1993, I remember it very well, it was Somalia
where mission creep got us into a considerable amount of trouble in
Mogadishu in October, and in my view there's a similar sort of weakness
that could be at play here.

And one of the questions I want to ask you begins with this. Look, this
wasn't just terrorism, this is an Islamist form of terrorism. This is a
religious based act against the United States of America. And you can't
-- and part of the problem it seems to me is when we lump terrorism all
together, it seems to me we miss a very important narrative, I think
that -- and you could really see it after the World Trade Center I
bombing. I mean there was a significant amount of disdain when Nosair
tried to get the refund on the Ryder truck and there was a presumption
these guys couldn't possibly be sufficiently sophisticated to carry out
a really serious attack against the United States, and that was
shattered on the 7th of August. And, Ambassador Ryan, I have great
sympathy for your loss on that day of 1998.

But talk to me. I mean, during that period of time, you've got World
Trade Center I, not -- this is not Tamil Tigers, this is not
nationalists who are trying to territory, this was basically the
beginning of an Islamist attack on the United States. And then you've
got Mir Kansi open fire at CIA headquarters within 30 days of that
moment in 1993. And then you've got, the big one for me, you've got
three of them actually in a row, '96,'98 and 2000. And I'd like to know,
in both of your cases, did you have a sense of increased urgency coming
from the top? Either from President Clinton, and Berger and your own
bosses in Justice and in State? Or from President Bush, following the
declaration that al Qaeda was responsible for the USS Cole on October of
2000?

Because unless there's action from the top which occur obviously after
the 11th, nothing's going to happen. I mean just say what among the
things that I've acquired thus far in a relatively short time of reading
the documents, is a surprising sense of the sophistication of 19 men
plus some others who did in fact observe and were able to get visas and
passports to come to the United States and in spite of the published
story to the contrary, as you heard staff say, they were fraudulently
manipulated. They came to the United States and as Secretary Lehman's
pointing out, they broke the law.

And then we'll hear later in the panel, the observed U.S. commercial
aircraft and saw additional weaknesses and they exploited those
weaknesses. So we'll hear this afternoon staff say to us that by the
spring 2001 there was a high probability they were going to be
successful. And the question I've got over and over here I hear from
people asking, well how in the heck did that happen? How -- I mean how
could they be so successful against the United States of America? How
could they exploit all of these weaknesses?

Every single point along the way we hear, didn't get enough money from
the Congress, that was the problem, they didn't deliver the right
intelligence, I didn't get this, I didn't get that, everybody's got, you
know, a pretty good case of plausible deniability along the line. But
did at any point in this point moment, take '93 as an example. You were
there in 1993, did President Clinton say in 1993, after World Trade
Center, either '93 or '95 after the trial of Ramzi Yousef had made it
clear what was going on?

Did at any point in that time did you hear from the President of the
United States through the principal, your principal in this case being
the secretary of State, that we've got to change the way we're doing it?
That we're going after Islamist extremists, that's who we're going
after, it's not terrorists, its Islamist extremists and we know where
they come from?

MS. RYAN: There were a couple of presidential decision directives on
terrorism, on sharing information, I don't remember specifically talk
about Islamic terrorists. The intelligence that we had, despite World
Trade Center I seem to be always directed overseas, at our interests
over seas.

MR. KERREY: Mir Kansi was not directed overseas --

MS. RYAN: Mir Kansi, is that --

MR. KERREY: -- he was at CIA headquarters, for God's sake.

MS. RYAN: That's correct, that's a single individual.

MR. KERREY: And those 19 airmen at Khobar Towers certainly came from the
United States of America. They weren't going after Saudi citizens in
'92.

MS. RYAN: No, but the attacks were abroad, the attacks on our embassies
were abroad, so Consular Affairs put out all kinds of worldwide cautions
and public announcements and travel warnings to alert Americans to
dangers that we saw abroad.

MR. KERREY: How about after the millennium? How about after the
millennium, I mean, my God, we were afraid the country was going to come
to an end on New Year's Eve, and we got lucky, again as we'll hear later
on in our hearings, we got lucky in Seattle. I mean, after -- are you
saying to me that generally speaking that there was no expression from
the top either during President Clinton's or President Bush's
administration, that an attack on the United States can occur and one of
the points of weakness might be the way we're granting visas overseas?

MS. RYAN: Not that I remember, that we were looking internally. We were
looking at people who might attack us abroad --

MR. KERREY: Why, why? Didn't it surprise you today, you must -- I mean,
it's got to cause you great pain to look at these visas and passports, I
mean, these documents that we put up earlier. I mean, doesn't it
surprise you that neither President Clinton nor President Bush came and
said that Islamist extremism is a serious threat and we've got to
tighten up our consular offices or immigration policies in the United
States?

MS. RYAN: But we had -- we required visas of Saudis, if that's the issue
that you're talking about?

MR. KERREY: Oh no, I'm talking specifically the President of the United
States saying not that terrorism or illegal or criminals are a problem,
but that Islamist extremism is a problem. That that is a threat to the
United States of America on our own soil?

MS. RYAN: Well, we knew that bin Laden is a threat to the United States
of America and that he is an Islamic extremist, but I would ask you,
sir, how would -- I mean, would you not issue to everyone who's a
Muslim? Would you not issue visas? I mean, how would you get at this
particular problem in terms of visas other than the way I described as
we were trying to do?

MR. KERREY: Ambassador, with great respect, that's closing the
Washington Monument solution, it's a straw man. No, I'm not proposing
that we not grant visas to all Muslims, I'm merely suggesting that it
seems to me, that in '93 and again in 2001 that presidential directives
shouldn't have said that terrorism is a priority, it should have said
that Islamist terrorism is the top priority and in neither case does it
seems to be that that happened.

I mean, in your own words you didn't hear it in '93, you didn't hear it
in '96, did you hear it in '98? After -- I mean, after Dar es Salaam in
Nairobi that was a very sophisticated military operation.

MS. RYAN: Well, we knew that the CIA director, the director of Central
Intelligence declared war on al Qaeda and bin Laden in '98 as a result
of the bombings of our embassies. But again we ask you, I mean, Islamic
extremism, what would we -- how -- I mean, I don't understand how --

MR. KERREY: But we attacked al Qaeda's camps on the 20th of August,
1998, and normally in that kind of situation you expect a counter
attack, you expect something to happen. And I'm just asking -- I'd ask
either one of you, did after 20 August 1998 you hear from the President
that we're going to alter our directive and we've got to change the way
we're doing business issuing visas to people that are suspected Islamic
terrorists?

MS. RYAN: No.

MR. KERREY: Was there any change coming from the top, either in
Immigration or in the Consular Office? Either from the secretary of
State or from the attorney general?

MS. RYAN: Not that I remember.

MR. KERREY: And I -- first of all -- I lastly join everybody else in
thanking you for coming. Mr. Chairman, that's the end of my questions, I
appreciate very much, your coming.

MR. KEAN: Thank you, Senator.

Ambassador, I thank you very, very much for your testimony.

MS. RYAN: Thank you.

MR. KEAN: We now come to our second panel, which we have entitled "An
Incident in Florida." We have a single witness, Jose Melendez-Perez. Mr
Melendez-Perez is a 26-year honorable veteran of the United States Army
and in his 12th year as an immigration inspector at Orlando
International Airport. Formally an employee of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, he is now employed by the Department of Homeland
Security's Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. Would you rise, sir,
to take the oath?

(Witness sworn.)

Thank you very much, sir. Mr. Melendez-Perez?

MR. JOSE MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Good morning, Mr. Chairman Kean, Vice Chairman
Hamilton, members of the Commission, thanks for letting me speak to you
today. Before I begin to relay this story of encountering. I had on
August 4, 2001 would a Saudi male there are two things you should know.
Number one, on this day I was just doing my job. I'm honored and proud
that the work I did apparently did help stop a potential hijacker in
September 11 tragedy and I'm honored to be here today.

Two, when I conducted the secondary inspection of the subject, I was
going on my experience and training in interview techniques that I
learned primarily in the military, immigration law and fraud learning in
the Immigration and Naturalization Service and my years of experience at
Orlando International Airport of serving and working with Saudi
nationals, many of whom come with their families through Orlando
International on their way to Disneyworld.

On August 4, 2001 I was assigned as a secondary inspection officer at
the Orlando International Airport. My supervisor at the inspection
between primary and secondary inspections and on this day I was assigned
to secondary inspection. At approximately 17:35 hours I was assigned the
case of a Saudi national who had arrived on Virgin Atlantic flight 15
from London Gatwick Airport. As Saudis coming through Orlando to travel
to Disneyworld are common, I have plenty of line experience with Saudis.

In this particular case the subject was referred to secondary inspection
because the primary inspector could not communicate with him and his
arrival/departure form I-94 and custom declaration form C6059-B were not
properly completed. I first queried the subject's name, date of birth
and passport number through the computer system with negative results.
Subject documents appeared to be genuine. A search of the subject and
his personal belongings were also negative.

Subject was in IDENT and photographed. In addition a complete set of
fingerprints was taken on form FD-249. Through my INS training and
military experience my first impression of the subject was that he was a
young male, well groomed with short hair, thin mustache, black long
sleeved shirt, black trousers and black shoes. He was about 5'6" and in
impeccable shape with large shoulders and thin waist, he had a military
appearance.

Upon establishing eye contact he exhibited body language that appeared
arrogant. In fact, when I first called his name in secondary room and
matched his name with papers, he had a disturbing look. I had the
impression of the subject that he had knowledge of interview techniques
and had military training. Upon my initial review of the subject
paperwork and documents, I noticed that he did not have a return airline
ticket or hotel reservation. Upon learning that the subject did not
speak English, at least that is what he want us to believe, I contacted
an Arabic interpreter from the Department of Justice interpreter list.

My first question to the subject through the interpreter, why he was not
in possession of a return airline ticket, the subject became visibly
upset and in an arrogant and threatening manner, which include pointing
his finger at my face, stated that he did not know where he was going
when he departed the United States. What first came to mind at this
point was the subject was a hit man. A hit man doesn't know where he's
going because if he's caught, that way he doesn't have anything or any
information to bargain with. My wife said that I was watching too much
movies -- (laughter).

Subject then continued stating that a friend of his was to arrive in
United States at a later date and that his friend knew where he was
going. He also stated that his friend will make all the arrangements for
subject departure. I asked him if he knew where his friend was to arrive
in the United States and he respond that his friend was to arrive in
three or four days. I asked him the purpose of his trip was and how long
he want to stay. He responded that he will be vacation and traveling
through the United States for six days.

At this point I realized his story did not seem plausible. Why would he
be vacationing for only six days and he spend half of his time waiting
for his friend? It became apparent that the subject was being less than
truthful concerning his true intention. At this time I ask him again
where he was going to stay? He say a hotel. I then told him that without
knowledge of the English language or a hotel reservation he would have
difficulty getting around Orlando. He answered that there was someone
waiting for him upstairs.

When asked the person's name he changed story and said no one was
meeting him. He said he was to call someone's home, that he would
contact someone locally to pick him up. I then asked the subject for the
person's phone number and name and he refused to provide, stating that
it was none of my business. He stated that it was a personal matter and
he did not see any reason for me to contact that person. The subject was
very hostile throughout the entire interview that took approximately one
and half hours.

Subject was in possession of $2,800. U.S. dollars and no credit card.
This amount did not appear sufficient for a six day vacation plus a
hotel room and a return ticket since one way to Dubai where he
originated from would cost approximately $2,200. When confronted with
these facts he responded that his friend was going to bring him some
money. I then asked why he will bring you some money. He reply, "
Because he's my friend." I then ask how long do you plan to stay or how
long do you know this person. He answer, "Not too long." I don't have
any friends who would buy a plane ticket for me, I know that fact.

And then I say to myself I would try to place him under oath and explain
the consequence of giving a false statement and see how he respond. He
agreed to answer under oath. However, when I ask the first question, he
say, "I won't answer." The Arabic interpreter stated to me something to
the effect that something is not right. At this point I gave my
supervisor a synopsis of the case and explained my suspicions that the
individual was malafide i.e. that his true intent in coming to the
United States was not clear and he appeared to be very evasive.

After presenting the case to my supervisor, he felt that assistant
airport director should be contacted for further instructions. Normally
second line supervisor such as AAPD are not contacted in such matters
but because of the fact that we have provided no specific ground for
removal, higher up confirmation was needed. My supervisor then proceeded
to call the AAPD at home to explain the case and get concurrence for
removal. After my supervisor presented the fact to the AAPD, he then
asked to speak directly with me.

The AAPD asked me numerous questions concerning the case. I explained
that apart from not having a return ticket and possibly not having
sufficient funds, the subject appeared to be malafide. I further
explained to the AAPD that when the subject looked at me I felt bone
chilling cold effect -- the bottom line, he gave me the chills. You
would have to be present to understand what I'm trying to explain. The
AAPD then asked if I had tried to place him under oath. I replied that I
had tried to place the subject under oath, but the subject refused to
answer my questions.

The AAPD then stated that under section 235(1)(a)(5) of the Immigration
Nationality Act, an applicant could be required to state under oath any
information sought by the immigration officer regarding the purposes and
intention of the applicant in seeking admission to the United States.
The AAPD further stated that he was convinced from what I have stated
and my belief about the subject, that the individual was malafide and
should be allowed to withdraw his application or be set up for expedited
removal.

I then proceeded to advise the subject that he did not appear to be
admissible to the United States. He was offered the opportunity to
voluntarily withdraw his application for admission. However, at this
time he became very upset and stated that he wasn't about to pay for a
return ticket. I stated to him, "No problem. We will place you in a
detention facility overnight and tomorrow we will make the necessary
arrangement to get you a plane ticket so you come back where you came
from." The interpreter stated to him the fact that we were planning to
place him in a detention facility and then he agreed to withdraw and
sign his I-275.

Along with another immigration inspector, I escorted the subject to his
departure gate for his removal. Before boarding the aircraft, the
subject turned to the other inspector and myself and said in English
something to the effect, "I'll be back." On August 4, 2001, the subject
departed via Virgin Atlantic flight 16 to London with connection flight
to Dubai.

On September 11th, 2001, while attending a meeting with the warden at
the Central Florida Processing Center (Department of Corrections)
concerning the use of their firing range, a correction officer came in
and advised the warden of the incident that just occurred in New York
City. As I watched the television, I could not help but think of the two
cases I processed and others concerning Saudi nationals. I immediately
contacted Orlando Airport. I do not remember which officer I spoke with
but I asked them to look up the cases and contact the FBI agent assigned
to the airport. To the best of my knowledge, the immigration officers
made copies of the August 2001 incident and provided the paperwork to
the FBI. The FBI have never interviewed me. I do not recall ever
speaking with Gitmo officials, INS headquarters contacted me twice.

I have no other contact with intelligence or law enforcement officials
outside of legacy INS. The only government contact I have had about this
incident came from the September 11th Commission this past fall when the
border team investigating the incident.

MR. KEAN: Thank you very much, sir.

Commissioner Ben-Veniste.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Thank you for your testimony, Officer Melendez. Let me
ask whether it is correct that at no point during the summer of 2001 did
you receive any notification that there was a higher danger or threat
level of potential terrorists coming into the United States.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Which timeframe, sir?

MR. BEN-VENISTE: In the summer of '01 at the same time as this incident.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Not that I recall, sir.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And in looking back at this matter, had you received
any information as to whether this individual, Mr. Kahtani, had actually
been interviewed in connection with his visa application to obtain a
visa to visit the United States?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is negative, sir.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And that is the case that our staff has found no
indication that Mr. Kahtani was physically interviewed by a consular
officer. Let me ask you this, as of August '01, when this incident
occurred, among the INS inspectors in Orlando, was there a recognition,
sir, that greater deference would be given to a Saudi national than,
say, a Mexican or a Jamaican?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Could you rephrase the question?

MR. BEN-VENISTE: That you would be more permissive in admitting a Saudi
rather than individuals from certain other nations?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Well, since I came in the service in 1992, the
consents of the Saudi people was they have to be treated with more tact
for their nation. You know what I mean. That's something that is not
inviting. However, any time that a new person come on board, basically,
that feeling is communicated by the more experienced inspectors.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: That if you hassled a Saudi citizen or that you took
more time up to the point even of permitting entry but you gave them
more attention that you might catch some kind of negative criticism?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is correct. Normally, as a matter of fact, the
day that I was working on this particular incident, one of my co-workers
stated to me, "You're going to get into trouble because you're trying to
refuse a Saudi." My answer was, "You know, I have to do my job and I
cannot use nationality as a guidance how to do or conduct my interview
or take care of my business."

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Officer Melendez, let's review the factors that you
considered on that day with respect to Mr. Kahtani. He was a young man
of 26 years of age traveling alone whereas the vast majority of Saudi
visitors to this country who depart at Orlando are in family groups.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That's correct.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Mr. Kahtani appeared unable to speak or understand the
English language.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Correct.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Mr. Kahtani was travelling on a one-way ticket and had
no good explanation about where he was going once he was to depart from
the United States.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is correct.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: His physical appearance was that of an individual who
was very fit and perhaps had military training.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is correct.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: His attitude was strikingly unusual. He was arrogant
and combative from the start, fixing you with a piercing glare and
became even more confrontational as the interview process proceeded.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is correct, sir.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And despite his lack of facility in the English
language, he had no hotel reservation and gave contradictory answers as
to who was supposed to have assisted him either immediately or within
three days of his arrival.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is correct, sir.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And, seven, he had insufficient funds to spend six days
as a tourist in the United States and then to purchase a return ticket
to Dubai.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is correct.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And when you asked for reasonable information about the
identity of the individual who would be meeting him or assisting him or
the person he would contact back at home who would arrange for
information to be provided about the friend who was going to lend him
money, he refused to answer.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is correct, sir.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Your interpreter confirmed that there was something
seriously suspicious about this man.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is affirmative.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And Mr. Kahtani refused to answer questions once you
administered an oath.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That's correct.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And on the basis of all these factors, you concluded
that Kahtani might well be a hit man here in the United States to do
harm.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is correct.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And yet, despite all of these factors, because you were
dealing with a Saudi national, you were not certain by any means that
your superiors would agree with your determination to deny entry.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is correct.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: What was the perception at that time at the INS among
your colleagues as to whether the supervisors or the higher-ups would
back up a line officer such as yourself under such circumstances?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Well, I think that the difference on the supervisor
decision to continue on to get higher approval, it was based on
credibility. I mean, once you establish credibility with your
subordinates and your superiors and they know when you claim something
is not right, it's because you really indeed have the facts. You know,
that's the reason that I think I did make a difference and he went along
to contact somebody else, high echelon supervisor. And sometimes I feel
that if the outcome could have been the same if somebody else was making
the phone call. I wish inspector was the one who was doing the secondary
inspection. That's not taking anything less from my co-workers, but
would they have pursued the phone call taking in consideration that he
was a Saudi national.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: So the presumption was against the line officer, the
secondary officer determination that an individual of Saudi nationality
ought to be refused entry. You had to make you case, the burden was on
you.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is correct. That is correct.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Now, as we now know, with the benefit of investigations
subsequent to 9/11, Mohamed Atta, perhaps the ringleader of all the
terrorists here in the 9/11 plot, was at Orlando International Airport
on August 4, 2001, the very day that Mohamed Kahtani claimed at least in
part of his interview with you that someone was upstairs to meet him.
And we know that Mohamed Atta made a telephone call from that location
to a telephone number associated with the 9/11 plot. On the basis of
that information, as well as significant additional information which we
are now not at liberty to discuss in public session, it is extremely
possible and perhaps probable that Mohamed al Kahtani was to be the 20th
hijacker.

Based on that premise, and taking into account that the only plane
commandeered by four hijackers, rather than five, crashed before
reaching its target, it is entirely plausible to suggest that your
actions in doing your job efficiently and competently may well have
contributed to saving the Capitol or the White House, and all the people
who were in those buildings, those monuments to our democracy, from
being included in the catastrophe of 9/11, and for that we all owe you a
debt of thanks and gratitude.

(Applause.)

Let me ask you a couple of questions. We are running a bit late. With
respect to your recommendations that you would make, with respect to
perhaps training or otherwise empowering individuals now in the
Department of Homeland Security, where you are an officer, what would
you recommend that the higher ups here from the people on the line every
day doing their job?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: I would like to emphasize in training, training is
extremely important. I don't know what kind of training -- interview
techniques are there conducted -- are conducted at the academy at the
present time because it's under a new program, but I think that the
interview techniques not only should address why the person is coming to
the United States but also should include consequence, and going to
another line of questioning, that when you feel that something is wrong,
you can go that direction.

I strongly feel that time should not be a factor. You know, you've got
to take as long as you need to, to complete your job. Knowledge is
wonderful. We have greater knowledge since 2001, however, the human
factor has got to be there. The human factor has got to be there. The
questions have to be asked, the body language has to be checked, because
by conducting a good interview there's a lot you can determine. That
sixth sense must come to play to make the right decision.

About the round trip tickets, I think that that is something that some
other countries will not take, i.e. United Kingdom. If you go to the
United Kingdom without a return ticket, they will turn you right around.
You won't get in the country. It's only one piece of paper, that you are
inadmissible.

Support the supervisor's decision without fear that they are going to
get in trouble. I mean, we will make some wrong decisions. I mean,
that's human nature. But they have to understand -- everybody in the
chain of command has to understand that we have to do what we have to
do. And you're better off to make a wrong decision and send somebody
home that didn't have no reasons by going home than to admit somebody
because we will be afraid of the letters and the congressional letters
or letters from somebody and hamper the inspector and supervisors from
making the right decision in some locations.

The US-VISIT, we think that is a great program; however, we have
concerns about the departure portion of it. I mean, being (manned just
by a machine) how can we determine that this person went home. I think
that it would be a great tool. We've been talking about it for years but
by just having that system not manned by human beings that we can
confirm, I don't think that that is the right way to do it. My example
for that is that when we decline or refuse somebody, we escort the
person to the aircraft. We sit in the jet-way until that plane push back
to ensure that the person go home. So we should use the same principle
when we use in the departure portion of the US-VISIT program. I mean,
that is my personal opinion.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Now, you are with Customs, the last line of formal
interception of individuals coming into this country. Would you have a
recommendation with respect to consular officers who are interviewing or
who perhaps should be interviewing visa applicants in terms of training
for and providing techniques for interviews in order to make
determinations on the other end of the journey, on the start end of the
journey, rather than on the very last point at which an individual could
be refused entry?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: My recommendation on that regard would be that we
should receive the same type of training for our interviewing techniques
and we should know what the consular is asking this person abroad so we
can continue perhaps in a different line of questions to ensure that
this person has obtained a visa through the proper -- say legally, all
right, because sometimes we have people that go to the embassy, get
their visa, and then we have determined through the line of question
that the visa was obtained through fraud, that the guy didn't have what
was required in order to obtain that visa. And then it would be our job
to turn those people back.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And finally, let me ask you, Officer Melendez, about
the documentation for one of the hijackers who did successfully enter
and reenter the United States, Mohamed Atta. Our staff has shown you the
documents relating to Mr. Atta's entry into the United States and had
asked for your view in hindsight, but trying to put yourself in the
present moment looking at an individual who presented himself with the
documents that Mr. Atta presented when he entered the United States in
2001. And what did you conclude?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Well, based on the guidance from the law, the person
coming in to be a student, he must be in possession of a M-1 or F-1
visa. When he presented himself to the primary inspector without the
proper documents, that was grounds to be recommended refusal. I would
have recommended refusal to my supervisor. He was not in possession of
the right visa.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Can you explain that?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Well, the person is coming to the United States as a
student, must carry an I-20, take it to the embassy and get the proper
visa. If the person, for example, comes to the United States as a
prospective student, he will come with a B-1 or V-2, B-1 which will be a
business, or V-2 will be a visitor for pleasure, find a school of his
choice, and if he's accepted, he will submit a change of his status.
When the person is in the United States, if the status is approved, the
change of status is approved, he won't need the visa. He'll only need
the form the action form that he sent for the service center, and he
will go ahead and continue his studies.

However, once the person departs the United States, if he's coming back
to resume his studies, he must have the proper visa, which means that he
must take the I-20 from the particular school, go to the embassy and
obtain the proper visa. If the person fails to do that, then he is not
in possession of the right visa, so he could be denied entry to the
United States.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: So in summary, is it your view that because he
presented himself with an inappropriate visa, that he somehow talked his
way into the United States, despite the fact that his papers were not in
order?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: It is possible. That's my perception because he
didn't have the document.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And if Mr. Atta on the spot had said, well, never mind
about that, let me just come in as a tourist, what would have happened
with respect to that?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: He presented himself as a student. He must have
proof that he was a student. He cannot change the reason that he's come
into the United States after he makes the initial presentation to the
primary inspector.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Was there any other characteristic about Mr. Atta such
as his age that would have influenced you?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Well, his age and traveling by himself. Normally a
person traveling by himself coming to this country normally is coming on
business. Most of the time persons coming by themselves -- I can say a
good percentage of the time they came with their families when they came
to vacation. Remember that normally in my case, Orlando International,
normally all those people are coming to go to the attractions, so that
automatically would raise a flag if a person has come by himself with a
V-2 as a visitor. Unless the family is already here, because that
happened sometimes. A family came a few days prior and the person is
going to meet his family. But a male traveling by himself, no, sir.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Mr. Chairman, I don't have any further questions, only
because of the time, and I know we have much to do, but again, I want to
thank Mr. Melendez from all of us and for a grateful nation for an
individual using his common sense and his skills, doing his job in a way
that makes us all proud.

MR. KEAN: Commissioner Roemer.

MR. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I want to join in the salutes and the accolades to you on a job well
done and a job that's extremely difficult to do on a daily and hourly
and minute-by-minute basis, especially the good detective work in that
sense and the common sense that you used prior to 9/11. Let me ask you a
couple of questions about this case in particular, just to try and get a
better sense for what you were feeling in your heart and your gut. You
said that you recommended this case and you say in your testimony from
Mr. Bosch, who was a supervisor to you --

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That's correct.

MR. ROEMER: And you presented the case to Mr. Bosch and you took the
suspect into another room, even though his documents were clean. What
were the top two reasons? What was it that really bothered you about
this guy? His documents were clean, there's no really obvious compelling
reason why you might pick him out. You've just said to our commissioner
that there might have even been some pressure on some of the inspectors
to not be as tough on Saudis. What was it in particular, two things that
you could, you know, recommend to other people in your job?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Well, number one was the person's behavior, okay,
the demeanor, the way he was addressing, arrogant. Number two, that he
was impeccably dressed with a military appearance, by spending 26 and a
half years in the military, wearing short haircut and well, well trimmed
moustache normally is done in the military. And then the real, real
truth about the whole issue was that was a gut feeling that something
wasn't right. The more questions that I asked, the less plausible
answers that I get -- i.e., you know, why he was going to spend three or
four days waiting for somebody when he was going to be traveling through
the United States for six days. I mean, that doesn't make any sense, you
know. And then every time that he come up with one answer, he'd go to
another and he'd contradict himself, you know, and so evasive. So he
rang all the whistles, you know, that something wasn't right.

MR. ROEMER: So in order to then take this to the higher level and get
Mr. Bosch to recommend to Mr. Hernandez, his supervisor, who's at home
and has the day off and maybe is in bed, you then say, I feel strongly
enough about this particular case. This guy's impeccably dressed. I have
a gut sense about him. Something's not right. I have no facts to base
this on but something really bothers me about this person. How often is
it that Mr. Bosch might have said to you in this kind of case, let's not
get Mr. Hernandez out of bed on his day off. We don't have this
factually based. This is just your gut sense. As good a person as you
are, maybe you have the right sense on this one, I'm not going to buck
this one up. Does that happen very often?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: No, sir. No, sir.

MR. ROEMER: Once you decide that this is even a case not based on fact,
you can get this bucked up from Mr. Bosch to Mr. Hernandez?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Yes, sir. I feel strongly that that's the case. I
have this in previous incidents, in a few occasions when I have similar
-- or some kind of same problem and they are backing me up and we have
been right.

MR. ROEMER: With respect to Mr. Hernandez's conversation with you, he
asked to get on the phone directly with you?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Yes, sir.

MR. ROEMER: And he agrees with you right away?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Well, he asked me a few questions first. You know, I
mean, I explained to him the line of question, that he didn't have a
return ticket, that he said that somebody was waiting for him. You know,
I just give him a whole synopsis of it and then he asked me had I tried
to place him under oath. And when I said, "Yes, but he refused to
answer," then he went to understand -- you know, and then when I told
him that he should be there to see how this guy's behaving, you know, I
mean, something is not right, that's when he started to -- hey, I agree
with you. If you're telling me that's the way it is, that's the way it
is. So when I told -- when he asked me about the oath and I told him
that he refused to answer, so he says, "We got him under 235."

MR. ROEMER: And you're doing all this through interpreter when you're
asking Mr. Kahtani questions about his cash and who he's meeting and he
lies about trying to meet somebody, this is all through an interpreter
where?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is correct. Right in the -- what we call
secondary offices.

MR. ROEMER: So this interpreter is sitting with you?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: No, sir, he's on the phone. He's here in Washington.

MR. ROEMER: On the telephone?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: We got a speaker phone and that's what we do all day
interviews when we use interpreters.

MR. ROEMER: And is this awkward at all for you or is this communicated
pretty quickly when you're doing it through a speaker phone?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: We don't have no problems.

MR. ROEMER: Finally, on a question about post-9/11 now, you say in your
interview with your staff -- the question is "Do you have the manpower
today to make this work?" And you say, "Well, we only have four
secondary rooms and that's not enough," meaning that these four rooms
now in a post-9/11 environment, people are a lot more diligent, they're
looking for these clues, they're picking them up. These rooms fill up
very quickly now?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Very quickly. Yes, that's affirmative, sir.

MR. ROEMER: And how quickly do they fill up? If you're on an average day
and your first couple of hours on the job, how fast are these secondary
rooms filled up?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Well, normally in Orlando International we have all
the international flights come about the same time. They are 747s.
Virgin Atlantic have three flights, British Airlines have one, and we
can fill those things in about 40 minutes. I mean, sometimes we have
even about 20, 25 people just waiting to be interviewed for one reason
or another.

MR. ROEMER: You have a long queue then waiting for --

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Yes, sir.

MR. ROEMER: -- the four rooms.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: We have right now, yes, sir.

MR. ROEMER: And is there ever any subtle pressure on you not to get that
line too long or do you keep --

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: No, sir.

MR. ROEMER: Good.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: No, sir. All that has changed since that day.

MR. ROEMER: And do you need more rooms and more personnel?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Well, that's affirmative. We need more space. But my
understanding is that they're working on it because the new merger with
Customs and Border Protection, they're going to rearrange the setting of
the area.

MR. ROEMER: And split up the rooms or build more?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: I don't have any idea how they're doing it but I
know that they're building some engineering people for the Orlando
Greater International Airport personnel and they're working on some
blueprints.

MR. ROEMER: And finally, last question, has the attitude of some
deference to the Saudis changed in the post-9/11 environment?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Yes. Most definitely yes, sir.

MR. ROEMER: Thank you very much and thank you again for a job well done.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Thank you, sir.

MR. KEAN: Commissioner Lehman.

MR. LEHMAN: Yes, you are a first class professional and you did your
job. One would have hoped that higher up the chain, someone would have
said this being two years after -- three years after the attacks on the
embassies and after the director of CIA had declared war on al Qaeda and
all of the American lives that had been lost in various attacks of the
previous decade, that someone would have said above your level, "We need
to have the FBI come in and perhaps CIA to talk to this guy," because
your initial reaction was valid. He was obviously up to no good. He was
a Saudi. He was certainly in the prime suspect area. Why was he just
sent back? I'm talking above your level. Why didn't somebody call the
FBI and say, "You may want to talk to this guy"? Is the relationship at
the working level good enough between FBI and Border Security? Was it
then and is it now? Is there any relationship between, for instance,
your team at Orlando and CIA? Is there a way to call them in.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Yes, sir. Well, the reason that we didn't contact
the FBI or any other agency at that time, I tell you the truth, it never
went through our mind. Our main intention was to refuse the entry. Just
ensure that he didn't make the entry into the United States. That was my
main concern at that time. Number two, I didn't have any grounds as far
as the 235 which is refusing to answer under oath. So, at that time, I
believe that we didn't have that mentality, you know, to contact the
FBI. We didn't have anything. If we had found some documents or
something that is related to something that would incriminate a person,
yes, we will have contacted the FBI.

MR. LEHMAN: So the whole framework was one of law enforcement and
criminality rather than intelligence and policy?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is correct, sir. The FBI, we have a great
relation with them. We always have. I have never spoken to them with
reference to this particular case but I can tell you that they are
always in the area. As a matter of fact, last couple of days or last
couple of weeks, we have some incidents in which we had tipped off and
both agents have come up and show up. I think there is an outstanding
relation with them.

MR. LEHMAN: One last question. If everybody in the chain in the
different agencies involved had been as professional as you were, the
attack would not have taken place. Yet in the statistics, the turnover
in the officers now in the new Border Control combined agencies is about
15 percent, which is double what it is in the rest of the government. At
least, it was at the time of 9/11. Is your feeling today that people
like yourself are being retained? Is the morale high? Do people want to
stay or is there still a sense of frustration that is driving good
people out? Tell the truth and chain the devil -- (laughter.)

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Well, it is a small problem that we have and we're
looking forward that that get corrected down the line. But we have to
understand something. We have three legacy units coming to become one
and each one have an individual task. When you have a large family, you
know, you have a family and then you have a large family at once, then
everybody wants to have their own share or everybody wants to go their
own direction. So I foresee that, in the future, you know, it will take
time, everybody understands that we are one big family now and that is
coming throughout the whole United States. It going to take time to
determine if people will have a better morale and will want to stay,
we'll have to see and wait because right now, perception is perhaps this
side is getting a large portion of the cake versus this portion is
getting this less part of the cake and I'm going to leave it at that.
Okay.

MR. KEAN: Last question, I guess, from the Commission. Commissioner
Gorelick.

MS. GORELICK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Inspector Melendez, at the time that you had your exchange with al
Kahtani, Mohamed Atta is in fact upstairs. He is outside of your
jurisdiction. But he is in that airport, we believe, and that airport
has security. Local law enforcement has a presence there. Would it have
been possible at the time under the rules that you were operating under
at the time for you to call law enforcement that was on the other side
of the barrier that you manned to say there may be someone here that we
want to look for and talk to?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Normally what we do is when we identify that
somebody is waiting for somebody, we ask him the name of the person and
we page him. Or we go and look for that person if that person identifies
himself, we go and look for that person at the main terminal and we ask
them the question to verify the intent or the reason that the person
that they are waiting for is coming to the United States. In this case,
we didn't call anybody because the person didn't want to identify or
give me the person's name. He only said somebody was waiting for him and
then when I asked him for the name, he changed his mind, No, nobody is
waiting for me.

MS. GORELICK: Do you have the authority in these secondary interviews to
search the person?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Yes, we do.

MS. GORELICK: And did you search Mr. Kahtani?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: You know that I have been asked the same question
previously. At that time normally what we do when we have what we call a
turnaround which we have aircraft that we won't admit, we get a few
different officers involved on it. Like I was doing the interview and
somebody else might check his luggage and things like that. We have
another officer that does the fingerprinting. So I can't state for a
fact that we did check his luggage. But it's my belief that it was
checked but I really can't confirm it because I didn't do it myself.

MS. GORELICK: But, in the ordinary course, you had the authority to --

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Oh, yes.

MS. GORELICK: -- both search and to reach, again, across the barrier to
find the person who is supposedly accompanying or meeting the person as
to whom you have suspicions?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: That is correct. The policy is we check the system,
we check the luggage, we check the personal belongings, we check
everything before. Normally, the checking of the luggage is very
interesting when you don't have anything that you can base yourself on.
You're looking for additional information to --

MS. GORELICK: If the person doesn't respond to the page, would you reach
out to the security and law enforcement otherwise in the airport to
apprehend such a person?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: No. Normally what we do is we get the airline
involved to search for that person that we're looking for. But we have
never been in a position to get the law enforcement officer to arrest
somebody. If somebody is in the United States, you know, he's here. We
concentrate on the people making the entry to the United States. That's
the one that we concentrate on.

MS. GORELICK: Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Thank you very much, Mr. Melendez-Perez.

MR. KERREY: Mr. Chairman, I have one --

MR. KEAN: Yes. Very briefly, Senator Kerrey.

MR. KERREY: I will try and be brief. Officer Melendez, can one presume
that if this gentleman had been skinny and an unkempt moustache and
chewed gum and spoke a little English and had a return trip and plenty
of cash and somebody could possibly identify him, that he could have
gotten through?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: It could have been possible, yes, sir.

MR. KERREY: So do you feel confident relying on the kind of remarkable
instincts that you showed at the border, relying on instinct alone to
make sure that somebody who does have hostile intent against the United
States of America is not getting through?

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Yes, sir. I feel like if the primary inspector refer
because she could not communicate with the individual and then it was in
my hands to make that decision and perhaps the alert was raised because
of the way he was dressing but perhaps a good line of question will
never -- I mean, never assume that everything in right. Just go with
your gut feelings and ask the questions and pass the battle line.

MR. KEAN: Thank you, Mr. Melendez-Perez. Thank you very much. You are an
honor to your profession, an honor to the United States government and
thank you very, very much for your service to this country.

MR. MELENDEZ-PEREZ: Thank you for the invitation, sir.

MR. KEAN: We will adjourn now until 1:00.

(Lunch recess.)

MR. KEAN: We will now reconvene. Once again we're going to begin with a
staff statement, introducing Dr. Zelikow.

MR. ZELIKOW: Members of the Commission, working with you your staff has
developed initial findings on the identification, watchlisting and
tracking of three individuals who helped carry out the 9/11 attacks upon
the United States. Those individuals are Nawaf al Hazmi, Salem al Hazmi
and Khalid al Mihdhar. These findings and judgments may help your
conduct of today's public hearing and inform the development of your
recommendations. This report reflects the results of our work so far. We
remain ready to revise our understanding of these topics as our work
continues.

This staff statement represents the collective effort of a number of
members of our staff: Douglas MacEachin, Barbara Grewe, Susan Ginsburg,
Lloyd Salvetti, Alexis Albion, Thomas Eldridge, Michael Hurley and Lorry
Fenner did most of the investigative work reflected in this statement.

Our staff was fortunate. We could build upon a substantial body of work
carried out by the Joint Inquiry organized in 2002 by the Intelligence
Committees of the House and Senate. We also relied on some high quality
work performed by the National Security Agency along with cooperation
from the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of State. Again
we were impressed by the high caliber of the professionals engaged in
public service.

The Congressional Joint Inquiry highlighted this story as one of failed
opportunities to put these suspected terrorists on a watchlist to
prevent them from entering the United States. Therefore the lesson
learned, as director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet put it, was
to do a better job of putting people on the watchlist to correct what he
called, quote, "A weakness in our internal training and an inconsistent
understanding of watchlist thresholds," close quote. We believe the
portrayal of this story as a watchlisting failure may literally be true
but we think this label is profoundly misleading.

One: no one can know the might-have-beens, but we do not think it is
likely that putting the three future hijackers on a watchlist would, by
itself, have prevented the 9/11 attacks. As we pointed out earlier
today, al Qaeda adapted to the failure of some its operatives to gain
entry into the United States. None of these three individuals were
pilots.

Two: the watchlisting label reinforces the sense that watchlisting is a
chore off to the side of core intelligence work. Of course, everyone
rightly acknowledges it is a necessary chore, something that busy
intelligence officials just have to remember to do, yet they did not see
it as an integral part of their own intelligence work. The opportunity
to prevent the attacks would not have arisen just from preventing these
people from entering the United States, it would have come from
intelligence work that used watchlisting as a tool.

Three: the watchlisting label also distorts the analysis of
accountability. It tends to cast a harsh light on whether one or two
people at headquarters did their job. That focus may be unfair. It
certainly is too narrow. We suggest instead that the watchlisting
failure was just one symptom of a larger intelligence failure. The
failure raises questions for the Commission about the CIA's and the
intelligence community's management of transnational intelligence
operations.

We will do what we can to reconstruct this story given the appropriate
constraints on what can be said about such topics in public. The story
is detailed, but the details are essential. We'll start with the initial
lead and the hindsight issue. The lead in this case came from the
analysis of communications by the National Security Agency or NSA. The
NSA and the intelligence community obtains what it calls signals
intelligence or SIGINT. Some sources relevant to this case are no longer
operational. We are therefore able to say a little more about it now
without disclosing any of the details about the methods used to collect
such intelligence.

The intelligence community obtained additional sources after the embassy
bombings in East Africa. These particular sources were important. They
offered insight into a larger al Qaeda network in the Middle East and
were linked directly to the East Africa bombings. In late 1999, NSA
analyzed communications associated with a man named Khalid, a man named
Nawaf and a man named Salem. NSA analysts at the time thought Salem was
Nawaf's younger brother. They were right.

We now know Nawaf was in Karachi, Pakistan. Khalid was in Yemen. Nawaf
planned to leave Karachi on January 2nd, 2000 and they were making plans
to meet in Malaysia. Nawaf planned to leave Karachi on January 2nd,
important detail. By early on December 31st, Pakistani time, U.S.
officials in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, were following the
situation. At this point the relevant working level officials in the
intelligence community knew little more than this, but they correctly
concluded that Nawaf and Khalid may be part of, quote, "an operational
cadre," close quote. And that, quote, "Something nefarious might be
afoot," close quote.

We believe every available resource should have been devoted to learning
who these people were and trying to spot and track them. NSA did not
think it was its job to initiate this research on its own. It saw itself
as an agency to support consumers such as CIA. It tried to respond
energetically to any requests made of them, but it tends to wait to be
asked. If NSA had been asked to try to identify these people, NSA would
have started by checking its own database of earlier information from
these same sources. Some of this information had been reported and
disseminated around the community, some had not. But it was all readily
accessible in NSA's database.

NSA's analysts would promptly have discovered who Nawaf was, that his
full name was Nawaf al Hazmi and that he was an old friend of Khalid.
NSA analysts also could then have readily inferred that Salem might be
named Salem al Hazmi. But NSA was not asked to do this work, at least
not until much, much later. Some might say that such comments display
20/20 hindsight, elevating the importance of these reports out of
hundreds of items. This is a reasonable argument. But in this case, we
think our critique is fair and not distorted by hindsight. Why?

At the end of 1999 and in early 2000, the period of the Millennium
alert, the danger from al Qaeda was, by all accounts, the number one
national security priority of the United States. It was the focus of
practically daily meetings by the top officials of the government. These
particular sources of information were especially important ones. Their
links to al Qaeda were, in the words of one cable, quote, "notorious,"
close quote. They had been linked directly with the East Africa embassy
attacks. The relevant analysts have told us, that at the time these
sources were among the very best on al Qaeda.

The intelligence community had reported that Nawaf and Khalid were
deploying to meet in Kuala Lumpur. Following up on intelligence, U.S.
officials were active in Yemen and in the United Arab Emirates where
Khalid would get his connecting flight. Other information reinforced the
picture of an emerging operation of some kind, and Salem's plans to
arrive in Yemen soon.

Nawaf, Khalid and now Salem made further arrangements. Nawaf made plans
to arrive in Malaysia on January 4th. The intelligence community thought
Nawaf was still in Pakistan and was not leaving there until the 4th.
Other officials could have worked on logical flight itineraries and
perhaps realized that Nawaf could and probably did keep to his original
plan, leaving Pakistan for South East Asia on January 2nd. He then
planned to, and did leave his Asian stopover, probably Singapore, for
Kuala Lumpur on January 4th. This detail matters because it meant that a
possible opportunity to check and track Nawaf's departure from Pakistan
had already been lost.

Officials in Pakistan tried to do this on the 4th, they had already
missed Nawaf. On January 3rd, both CIA headquarters and U.S. officials
around the world began springing energetically into action. With the
information about Khalid's travel itinerary, U.S. officials in Yemen,
the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia performed as well as could be
hoped. Long standing efforts to build relationships with friendly
foreign services paid dividends. Though they had missed Nawaf, officials
had more success in tracking Khalid. He was identified as Khalid al
Mihdhar. His Saudi passport was photocopied. It showed he had a visa to
visit the United States.

U.S. officials in Jeddah quickly confirmed that their post had issued
this visa in April 1999. Khalid al Mihdhar was tracked as he arrived at
Kuala Lumpur on January 5th. He and other Arabs, still unidentified were
surveilled as they congregated in the Malaysian capital. On January 5th,
CIA headquarters notified officials around the world that, quote, "We
need to continue the effort to identify these travelers and their
activities to determine if there is any true threat posed," close quote.
The same cable said the FBI had been notified. The cable also asserts
that Mihdhar's travel documents also were given to the FBI.

The weight of available evidence does not support that latter assertion.
At this point the case was considered important enough to mention it in
the regular updates on al Qaeda being given to the top officials in the
U.S. government. On January 3rd and 5th, the head of CIA's unit on al
Qaeda apparently briefed his bosses on these developments as part of his
regular daily updates. These updates, which included other ongoing
operational developments, were usually reviewed every day by Director
Tenet and by the National Security Advisor Sandy Berger. On January 5th
and 6th, the director of the FBI, Louis Freeh, and other top FBI
officials were briefed on the operation as one of their regular updates
and we're told, correctly, that CIA was in the lead and that CIA had
promised to let FBI know if an FBI angle to the case developed.

On January 6th, two of the Arabs being tracked in Malaysia left for new
destinations, one in Thailand and another in Singapore. After the fact,
efforts were made to track them. U.S. officials in Kuala Lumpur wondered
if one of these Arabs was the still mysterious Nawaf. Both returned to
Kuala Lumpur within the next 24 hours, though the authorities did not
know it at the time. The two individuals apparently were Nawaf al Hazmi
and an individual now known as Khallad bin Attash. We'll discuss Khallad
again in a moment.

On January 7th and then again on January 10, CIA headquarters notified
the field that it had run searches on the names it had so far about this
case and said these searches produced no hits. Headquarters was trying
to support the operations in the field. The field had given them
information about people being tracked. Headquarters had checked CIA's
own database and found nothing. These headquarters officials had not
checked the databases at NSA or specifically asked NSA to do so.

As mentioned earlier, if NSA had done this job its analysts would
quickly have identified Nawaf as Nawaf al Hazmi. Someone then could have
asked the State Department to check that name too. State would promptly
have found its own record on Nawaf al Hazmi. That record would have
shown that he too had been issued a visa to visit the United States.
They would have learned that the visa had been issued at the same place,
Jeddah, and on almost the same day as the one given to Khalid al
Mihdhar. But none of this was known at the time.

On January 8th, surveillance reported that three of the Arabs under
surveillance suddenly left Kuala Lumpur on a short flight to Bangkok
traveling together. U.S. officials in Kuala Lumpur asked U.S. officials
in Bangkok for help. The next day, headquarters, noticing what was going
on and working on a Sunday, backed up Kuala Lumpur's message with
another message marked NIACT immediate. That meant the incoming cable
would alert the duty officer and ensure that it was read and acted upon
regardless of the hour. Kuala Lumpur was able to identify one of the
travelers as Khalid al Mihdhar.

After the flight left they learned that one of his companions had the
name al Hazmi. Remember, that the officials did not have information
that would have allowed them to put that last name together with the
name they did know about, Nawaf. About the third person all they had was
part of a name, it was part of the name of the alias being used by
Khallad bin Attash. Khallad is a nickname, the Arabic word for silver,
and refers to Khallad's artificial leg. Khallad was then traveling under
an alias. One reason he may have been traveling around East Asia at this
time is that he may have been helping to plan possibly hijackings on
aircraft, perhaps in connection with an early idea for what would become
the 9/11 plot.

Khallad also had completed his work in helping plan the destruction of a
U.S. warship visiting Yemen, the USS The Sullivans. The attack had just
failed, unnoticed. The boat filled with explosives had sunk. Only the
terrorists knew what had gone wrong. Almost everything was salvaged and
prepared for another day. Khallad would later be a principal planner in
the next try nine months later. That was the October 2000 attack on
another U.S. ship visiting Yemen, the USS Cole, an attack which almost
sank the warship and did kill 17 American sailors.

Bangkok and beyond. The information came to Bangkok too late to track
these travelers as they came in. Had authorities in Bangkok already been
alerted for Khalid al Mihdhar as part of a general regional or worldwide
alert, they might have tracked him coming in. Had they been alerted to
look for a possible companion named Nawaf, they might have noticed him
too and even tracked Khallad as well. Instead, the authorities were
alerted only after Kuala Lumpur sounded the alarm. By that time, the
travelers had already disappeared into the streets of Bangkok.

We now know that two other al Qaeda operatives, two in addition to the
three, then flew to Bangkok to meet with Khallad in order to pass him
money. Some of this money was reportedly given to Hazmi and Mihdhar for
their upcoming work in the United States. None of this was known at the
time.

On January 12th, the head of the CIA's al Qaeda unit updated his bosses
that surveillance in Kuala Lumpur was continuing. He may not have known
that in fact the Arabs had dispersed and the tracking was falling apart.
U.S. officials in Bangkok regretfully reported the bad news on January
13th. The names they had were put on a watchlist in Bangkok so that Thai
authorities might notice if they left the country. U.S. intelligence did
learn that one of the travelers was using the name that was Khallad's
alias. Kuala Lumpur promptly asked for more information and agreement,
quote, "to share that information for watchlisting purposes," close
quote. There was no apparent response and Kuala Lumpur didn't follow
through on its own watchlisting ideas.

On January 14th, the head of the CIA's al Qaeda unit updated his bosses
that officials were continuing to track the suspicious individuals who
had now dispersed to various countries. Unfortunately there is no
evidence of any tracking efforts actually being undertaken by anyone
after the Arabs disappeared into Bangkok.

CIA headquarters asked NSA to put al Mihdhar on that agency's watchlist
which had limited effectiveness. But there was no other effort to
consider the onward destinations of these Arabs and to set up other
opportunities to spot them in case the screen in Bangkok failed.

Just from the evidence in al Mihdhar's passport, one of those possible
destinations and interdiction points would logically have been the
United States. Hence this watchlisting effort could have been seen as
integral to reviving a faltering tracking effort quite apart from the
other interests involved.

Weeks passed. Meanwhile, NSA would occasionally pass new information
generally of a personal nature associated with Khalid, Salem, Salem's
brother, Nawaf and perhaps Khallad as well. At this time, although the
intelligence community did not know it, Mihdhar was in San Diego,
California.

None of these reports seemed to have jogged renewed attention until
another matter reminded Kuala Lumpur about the case. That post prodded
Bangkok a bit in February about what had happened with those missing
Arabs. A few weeks later, in early March 2000, Bangkok responded to
Kuala Lumpur's question. It was reported that Nawaf al Hazmi, now
identified for the first time with his full name, had departed on
January 15th on a United Airlines flight to Los Angeles. We have found
no evidence that this information was sent to the FBI.

It was further reported that a person under the name Khallad was using
had departed Thailand for the last time on January 20th. His destination
was Karachi. As for Khalid al Mihdhar, his arrival on January 8th had
been noted but there was no record of his departure. In fact, Mihdhar
had been on the United flight to Los Angeles with Hazmi on January 15th.

We presume this departure information was obtained back in January on
the days that these individuals made their departures. Because these
names were watchlisted with the Thai authorities, we cannot yet explain
the delay in reporting this news. But since nothing particular was done
with this information even in March, we cannot attribute much
significance to this failure alone. By March 2000, Mihdhar and Hazmi had
already established their residence in San Diego. No one knew this at
the time because no follow-up was done with any of this information
until much later.

In January 2001, while working on the Cole attack, the CIA received
information that Khallad had attended the meeting in Kuala Lumpur. As
Director Tenet testified publicly before the joint inquiry, the Kuala
Lumpur meeting quote, "took on greater significance," close quote,
because this information placed the Arabs who were there with a known al
Qaeda operative. This discovery, however, did not lead to any fresh
effort to pick up the trail of Mihdhar and Hazmi. By that time, Mihdhar
had left the United States and returned to Yemen. But if a retrospective
of existing information had been conducted at this point, Hazmi might
have been tracked down in the United States and there would still have
been time to watchlist Mihdhar before he obtained a new United States
visa and reentered the United States to join in the 9/11 attacks.

Finally, in the summer of 2001, a thoughtful CIA official detailed to
the FBI, working with an FBI employee detailed to the CIA, did some
energetic detective work that at last unearthed and reexamined these old
puzzle pieces. It became apparent that both Mihdhar and Hazmi were in
the United States. They were watchlisted in late August 2001. It was
then too late to catch Mihdhar before he got another visa and returned
to the United States to rejoin the operation.

The connection to Salem al Hazmi, Nawaf's younger brother, had never
been made. So there was no effort to track his movements while in Yemen,
watchlist him before he obtained his visa or catch him as he entered the
United States on a Swiss Air flight to New York in June 2001. The search
in the United States for Nawaf al Hazmi and Mihdhar began. It had gotten
off to a stuttering, quarrelsome start by September 11th.

The watchlisting issue. The Department of State initiated and sponsored
the U.S. government's only pre-9/11 watchlist solely dedicated to
catching terrorists. This list, called TIPOFF, was created in 1987 by an
unassuming and enterprising public servant named John Arriza who still
helps sustain the program which is now considerably expanded. The
program was meant to keep terrorists from getting visas, of course. But
as the name implies, it also was a system to tip off intelligence and
law enforcement agencies that a suspected terrorist was attempting to
come to the United States.

Any overseas post that obtained appropriate derogatory information about
an individual had been told to enter into TIPOFF by sending the
appropriate cable. If the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and
Research saw the information, they could and often did take the
initiative to add the individual into TIPOFF. In 2001, the State
Department provided more source documents for TIPOFF than any other
agency, more than 2,000. In December 1999, CIA headquarters had repeated
this guidance to its posts overseas which technically also included its
al Qaeda unit at headquarters. In 2001, CIA provided more than 1,500
source documents for TIPOFF. It was CIA headquarters that finally
nominated Hazmi and Mihdhar for inclusion in TIPOFF.

Sharing of information with the FBI was vital from an intelligence
perspective, if the individuals were coming into the United States. But
FBI did not maintain the terrorists watchlist. That was the State
Department's job. FBI could contribute names like everyone else. In
2001, the FBI provided about 60 source documents for TIPOFF, fewer than
were obtained from the public media and a number approximately
equivalent to the contribution that year from the Australian
intelligence service.

It is worth noting that the Federal Aviation Administration's own no-fly
list was totally independent from TIPOFF. Few names were on this no-fly
list. So before 9/11, adding someone to TIPOFF would not have any
particular effect on their ability to board a commercial flight inside
the United States. So, to be specific, adding Hazmi and Mihdhar to
TIPOFF did not put them on a no-fly list and did not keep them from
flying on September 11th.

Therefore, in thinking about the question of accountability, that
potential list tends to expand to everyone. In effect, though, this
means no one. At the time of the Joint Inquiry report, the general
assumption was that the responsibility rested with some working level
official at CIA headquarters. Yet as we can see, many of the recipients
of those January 2000 cables could have done their part. Kuala Lumpur
thought about it and so on.

That is why we think this issue must be examined from a broader
perspective, that at the overall management of transnational
intelligence operations. After all, why would the watchlisting make a
difference? One purpose would have been to turn Hazmi and Mihdhar back
when they reached Los Angeles. In effect, throwing them back into the
sea. That would have served one purpose, but it might not have prevented
any attacks.

We think it may be more interesting to consider the intelligence
mission. Remember why TIPOFF had that name. The intelligence mission was
why the suspects were tracked in Malaysia rather than detained or
deported. If the FBI had been given the opportunity to monitor Hazmi and
Mihdhar in California and had been patient for months or a year, then
some larger results might have been possible, even after Mihdhar left.
The universe of possibilities expands after Hani Hanjour joined Hazmi in
December 2000, after which the two of them lived in Phoenix for several
months before driving across the country and linking up with other
future hijackers in Northern Virginia.

Up to this point, all of these hijackers named so far were involved in
the hijacking of American Airlines 77, which hit the Pentagon. But in
Northern Virginia, they linked up with a hijacker who had joined the
team assigned to United 175, thus creating a possible opportunity to
penetrate other teams associated with the Hamburg cell as well.

These are difficult what ifs. It is possible that the intelligence
community might have judged that the risks of conducting such a
prolonged intelligence operation were too high. The risk of losing track
of potential terrorists, for example. It is possible that the pre-9/11
FBI would not have been judged capable of conducting such an operation.

But surely the intelligence community would have preferred to have the
chance to make these choices. That is why we see this as an intelligence
story and a challenge for intelligence community management, management
of a transnational case. In trying to second-guess the management of
intelligence operations, the staff feels humbled as we encounter the
experience and hard work of so many of the officials we have
interviewed, although we have some very seasoned intelligence
professionals on our staff. We have listened hard to what the serving
officials have told us, as you can see.

These people cared deeply about combating terrorism. They have poured
much of their life energy into this cause. And we believe that many of
them were working in a system that was not well designed to take full
advantage of their accumulated talents. From the detail of this case,
one can see how hard it is for the intelligence community to assemble
enough of the puzzle pieces gathered by different agencies to make some
sense from them and then coordinate needed action to collect or to
disrupt. It is especially hard to do all this in a transnational case.

That was and is a challenge for management. In this case, there appears
to have been at least two strategic errors in management. First, the
managers of the case failed to get an all-source background analysis of
the players, canvassing what all agencies might know so they could
assemble the best possible picture for action. This omission is already
evident by the end of December 1999.

The second strategic error was that the managers of the case did not
systematically set up ways to track the hijackers as they moved in
predictable directions. Even if they slipped through the net in Bangkok,
it was foreseeable that a traveler with a U.S. visa in his passport
might seek to visit the United States. No one had the clear job of
ensuring that all the likely routes were covered. Who had the job of
managing the case to make sure these things were done?

One answer is that everyone had the job. That was the perspective the
Commission heard in its interview of the CIA's deputy director for
Operations, James Pavitt. Deputy Director Pavitt has been at or near the
top of this directorate for about six and a half years. He stressed that
the responsibility resided with all involved. Above all, he stressed the
primacy of the field. The field had the lead in managing operations. The
job of headquarters, he stressed, was to support the field and do so
without delay. If the field asked for information or other support, the
job of headquarters was to get it, and right away.

This is a traditional perspective on operations, and traditionally it
has great merit. It reminded us of the FBI's pre-9/11 emphasis on the
primacy of their field offices. When asked about how this traditional
structure would adapt to the challenge of managing a transnational case,
one that hopped from place to place, as this one did, the deputy
director argued that all involved were responsible for making it work.
He underscored the responsibility of the particular field location where
the suspects were being tracked at any given time. On the other hand, he
also said that the Counterterrorism Center was supposed to, quote,
"manage all the moving parts," close quote, while what happened on the
ground was the responsibility of managers in the field.

With this background, it is easier to understand why the way
headquarters handled this case may not have been so unusual. As pointed
out this morning, travel intelligence was not seen as a central concern.
Headquarters tended to support and facilitate, trying to make sure that
everyone was in the loop. From time to time, a particular post would
push one way or headquarters would urge someone to do something, but
headquarters never really took responsibility for the successful
management of this case. Hence the managers at headquarters did not
realize that the two strategic errors cited above had occurred, and they
scarcely knew that the case had fallen apart.

The director of the Counterterrorism Center at the time, Cofer Black,
recalled to us that this operation was one among many and that at the
time, quote, "It was considered interesting but not heavy water yet,"
close quote. He recalls the failure to get the word to Bangkok fast
enough, but has no evident recollection of why the case then dissolved
unnoticed.

Going the next level down, the director of the al Qaeda unit in CIA at
the time recalled to us that he did not think it was his job to direct
what should or should not be done. He did not pay attention when the
individuals dispersed and things fell apart. He would not have expected
NSA to do the retrospective work in its own database, but he was
uncertain of his own authority to order them to do it. There was no
conscious decision to stop the operation after the trail was temporarily
lost in Bangkok, but he acknowledged that perhaps there had been a let
down after the extreme tension and long hours in the period of the
millennium alert.

We believe both Mr. Black and the former al Qaeda unit head are capable
veterans of the Directorate of Operations, among the best the agency has
produced. Therefore we find these accounts more telling about the system
than about the people. In this system, no one was managing the effort to
ensure seamless handoffs of information or develop an overall
interagency strategy for the operation.

Such management of transnational operations fully integrating all source
analysis might require more employees. Deputy Director Pavitt told us,
as he has told Congress, that he does not think the availability of more
money would have prevented the 9/11 attacks. We are not sure that is
right.

Certainly since 9/11 the application of vast new resources within older
management models has achieved some significant gains, but this story is
not just about the past. We wonder whether the management of
transnational intelligence operations has adapted enough to cope with
the challenge of the war on terrorism.

Today's focus on travel intelligence has spotlighted the transnational
character of the problem. This particular story is especially tragic.
But we do not believe this operating style is unique to this case. We
are not sure that these problems have been addressed. We are not sure
they are even adequately acknowledged as a problem. And in an
environment driven by reactions to the latest threat report and
preoccupied with immediate operations, clear, accountable and strategic
management is a challenge. The intelligence community must overcome it.
Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Thank you very much, Dr. Zelikow.

MR. KERREY: Mr. Chairman, I just want to note for the record, we were
given this yesterday, I read this last night and I feel the same way
now. I just want to publicly make it clear that I think it's a very good
statement but there are many conclusions in here that I could not sign
off on. And I don't want the public to presume that because staff has
presented it to the Commission that the Commission embraces the
conclusions that have been reached fully.

MR. KEAN: No, that is correct. These are staff reports, not part of the
Commission conclusions.

If we have -- ask the next panel to come forward, please? Our next panel
is entitled, "Visas and Watchlisting Today." Heading it off will be
Ambassador Maura Harty, assistant secretary for Consular Affairs at the
United States Department of State. Ms. Harty has formerly served as
executive secretary at the Department of State and ambassador to
Paraguay. The ambassador will be followed by Russell E. Travers,
associate director for Defense Issues at the Terrorist Threat
Integration Center, known as the TTIC, where he manages TTIC's
government wide information sharing initiative and the development of
the USG's terrorist identities database.

Our third witness on this panel will be Donna Bucella, director,
Terrorist Screening Center at the FBI. Ms. Bucella served as United
States attorney for the middle district of Florida. She received the
attorney general's Exceptional Service Award for her extraordinary work
as a prosecutor in the Oklahoma City bombing investigation. She is on
detail to the FBI from the Transportation Security Administration where
she was a southeast areas director. If you could all rise please to take
the oath?

(Witnesses sworn.)

Ambassador Harty?

MS. HARTY: Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, I am very pleased to
be here today with my colleagues from TTIC and TSC. The fact that we are
three testifying here together highlights the unprecedented level of
cooperation among U.S. government agencies, aimed at improving border
security through enhanced information sharing and the fact that we are
using new approaches to border security to keep ahead of the changing
threat to our national security.

I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the critical role of the visa
process in defending our nation's borders and how we have strengthened
that system in the wake of the tragic events on September 11th, 2001.
Before I proceed further, however, I want to acknowledge the family
members of the victims of September 11th. None of us can know the pain
and suffering they have endured, but all Americans and people of decency
everywhere will forever remember the horror and condemn the actions of
those who inflicted such an outrage on our nation.

The Department of State together with other U.S. government agencies is
determined to eliminate potential vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks.
State's visa work is a vital element in providing for our national
border security. We have no higher responsibility than protecting our
citizens and safeguarding our country's borders. My goal since I was
confirmed as assistant secretary of State in November 2002 has been to
examine our processes from top to bottom to make them as strong a shield
against terrorists and criminals as we possibly can.

To this end, we have more than doubled the number of entries of
terrorists and criminals in our lookout database, enhanced our data
sharing capabilities with other agencies of U.S. government, revised our
consular officer training, and implemented new biometric programs for
foreign travelers so that we can adjudicate visas in light of these new
security threats, while continuing to welcome to our shores the
visitors, business people, students, researchers and immigrants who
enrich our society by their presence and who contribute to our nation's
economic well-being.

Now I'd like to provide a bit of detail about these efforts. The
consular officers of the Foreign Service, who adjudicate visas at over
200 embassies and consulates abroad, are truly our first line of
defense. Through them, our goal is to push the very borders of the
United States out as far as from our own shores as possible, so that we
stop a potential terrorist overseas. To do so, we must have the best
information available within the United States government on terrorist
threats. I cannot overemphasize this point.

One of the most reliable ways to stop those who intend to do us harm, is
to identify them to consular officers abroad. The Department of State,
working with other agencies, has made significant improvements to our
ability to share lookout information. Thanks to this new level of
collaboration, the data holdings in our consular lookout system now
total almost 18 million records of people ineligible or possibly
ineligible to receive visas. Much more than double what we had prior to
September 11. Most of the data in our lookout system now derives from
other agencies, especially those in the law enforcement and intelligence
communities.

We have cooperated in this important endeavor by working with my
colleagues from TTIC and TSC to integrate terrorist watchlists from
numerous government sources into one centralized point of reference for
everyone who needs to screen members of the public, from the police
officer on the beat to the consular officer abroad. Together with the
Terrorist Threat Integration Center, we will rely on TSC to ensure that
consular officers have access to the information they need to deny visas
to known or suspected terrorists.

We are proud that these institutions rest on a foundation that the
Department of State laid in the form of TIPOFF, a pioneering system in
the use of classified information for screening purposes, created in
1987. The TIPOFF database with its approximately 120,000 records is now
housed at TTIC. TTIC and TSC together will eliminate the stove piping of
terrorist data and provide a more systematic approach to posting
lookouts on potential and known terrorists.

We have also entered into a robust partnership with the Department of
Homeland Security and worked closely with them on a number of
initiatives to improve border security. DHS and State collaborated on
the implementation of the congressionally mandated SEVIS system to
verify student status and assist in student monitoring. We have
strengthened procedures following revocation of a visa by State, to
ensure timely notice to the DHS lookout systems.

We are currently engaged with DHS in implementing a biometrics program
to track the entry and exit of foreign visitors by using electronically
scanned fingerprints. Secretaries Powell and Ridge signed a memorandum
of understanding in September of 2003 which sets the terms under which
officers of the two departments will work together in the visa process.
We at the Bureau of Consular Affairs have undertaken a systematic review
of the visa process since September 11th to identify and eliminate
vulnerabilities in the system. Our overriding goal has been to provide
consular officers with the very best tools and the best training
possible.

We have made major changes in the consular training course by adding
four security counterterrorism sessions since 2001, two of which deal
specifically with counterterrorism. The third is a session provided by
diplomatic security on visa fraud and malfeasance, and a fourth session
teaches consular officers how to apply the terrorism provisions of the
Immigration and Nationality Act.

To improve interviewing at deception detection techniques, we contracted
outside interviewing experts to develop training specifically designed
for consular officers. Together we developed a module on analytic
interviewing which has -- which was introduced last November. Our goal
is to provide new consular officers with the best tools available as
they begin their critical roles in protecting U.S. border security. The
interviewing course is also being taught at the consular leadership
development courses which we conduct each year around the world, and in
the advanced consular course here in Washington to train our mid and
senior level officers as well.

After more than a decade of doing more with less, when the increasing
workload outstripped our resources, we are now hiring well above
attrition thanks to Secretary Powell's Diplomatic Readiness Initiative.
The department is establishing 161 new consular officer positions for FY
'04 and is requesting 123 more for 2005. These additional positions will
give us the ground troops necessary to staff our first line of defense.
We have established a new worldwide standard for visa interviewing
policy to comply with the congressional mandate, that we collect
biometric identifiers and include such in the non-immigrant visa.

We have implemented new regulations requiring that most visa applicants
appear for an interview. The following month we begin deployment of a
congressionally mandated biometric program at posts abroad to collect
electronically scanned fingerprints of all visa applicants. These
fingerprints will be matched against the Department of Homeland
Security's fingerprint database known as IDENT. In fact, we are already
successfully doing so at three posts, and will continue to bring online
even more posts just as quickly as we can.

When visa travelers enter the United States their identity will be
verified through DHS's U.S. visit program. We are now collecting
fingerprints at 55 posts overseas. All visa adjudicating posts will be
online and collecting biometrics by the congressionally mandated
deadline of October 26th, 2004.

Just as we are committed to the most secure visa adjudication process
and documentation, the same holds true for what I consider to be the
world's most valuable document, the U.S. passport. We recently completed
the systemwide introduction of the photo-digitized process for
passports. We then moved the production of passports issued abroad to
our U.S. domestic production facilities to take advantage of the
significant security improvements embodied in what we call the PhotoDig
process.

We are planning to introduce a new contact-list chip, passports to
strengthen our ability to link the authorized bearer of a passport and
its user. The department has also proposed implementing a travel
document requirement for U.S. citizens traveling to those parts of the
Western Hemisphere where a passport is currently not required and we are
engaged in discussions on that matter with DHS even as I speak.

We are by no means done. The systematic review is a continuing process.
Looking ahead now, we are actively working on new initiatives to build
on what I have just described. In 2004, we will introduce a new tamper
resistant machine readable immigrant visa foil to include digitized
photo and fingerprints. We will complete the worldwide deployment of
biometric visa capability and we will continue discussions with Canada,
Mexico and the rest of the international community to expand on
datashare.

Mr. Chairman and members of the Commission, the terrorist attacks of
September 11th highlighted as never before the crucial role the
Department plays in U.S. border security. Our response has been
energetic and committed to meeting the highest national security
standards. I want to assure you and especially the families of the
victims of terrorism that the Department of State and its Bureau of
Consular Affairs are determined to spare no effort to secure our borders
against terrorism, criminality, illegal migration and to create a visa
process in which the American people can place their confidence and
trust.

Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Thank you, Ambassador.

Who's going next?

Mr. Travers?

RUSSELL E. TRAVERS: Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, I'm pleased
to be here today to discuss the role of TTIC, the Terrorist Threat
Integration Center in the defense of our nation's borders.

As the Commission knows, TTIC was a presidential initiative announced at
last year's State of the Union address almost exactly one year ago. We
formally stood up on 1 May, 2003. Operating as an interagency joint
venture, TTIC currently has assignees from 16 separate federal
intelligence, law enforcement and homeland security organizations. The
mission, simply put, is to integrate and analyze terrorist threat
information collected domestically or abroad and to disseminate such
information to appropriate recipients.

As a part of that mission, TTIC is charged with maintaining an
up-to-date database of known and suspected terrorists. It is that aspect
of our mission that I want to discuss today. In doing so, I'll briefly
elaborate on three points. First, the community has corrected previously
identified shortcomings associated with database and watchlisting
support. Second, TTIC working with our community partners has a series
of initiatives to further enhance our support to the newly created
Terrorist Screening Center. And third, we are making significant
progress in the critical area of information sharing across the
government.

First, our progress to date. Over the last two years, the intelligence
and law enforcement communities have been engaged in a comprehensive
scrub of historical reporting to ensure that our databases are current.
Led primarily by CIA, CTC and the FBI, this has involved respectively
the review of literally millions of intelligence cables and previous
international terrorism cases. The goal is to ensure that anyone who
should have been watchlisted has been in fact so listed.

This historical review has been coupled with a significant growth in new
reporting that has occurred against the terrorism target over the past
two years. The net effect is that the number of records in the TIPOFF
terrorist identities database has grown from approximately 60,000 in
September of '01 to over 120,000 records at the beginning of this year.
A similar percentage growth has occurred in the number of individuals
actually watchlisted. These ongoing efforts have been supplemented by a
significant streamlining of the U.S. government's approach to
maintaining terrorist identity databases and supporting watchlisting.

Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6, signed in September of '03,
assigns to TTIC and the newly created Terrorist Screening Center precise
responsibilities. TTIC is required to maintain an up-to-date database of
known and suspected terrorists and to service TSC's single source of
terrorist information. The one exception to this is for purely domestic
terrorism information that will be provided by the FBI.

One particular aspect of HSPD-6 has already been implemented.
Specifically, the movement of State Department's highly regarded TIPOFF
database into TTIC occurred in mid-November and it has been fully
operational since. Similarly, we are in the midst of receiving data
holdings from other federal intelligence and law enforcement
organizations. We have already increased the analytic resources devoted
to TIPOFF by a factor of four, as we prepare to receive this additional
data.

With that description of our progress to date, we also have a number of
very near-term initiatives tied to HSPD-6 and oriented toward enhancing
the quality of our support to the watchlisting effort. First, we are
working with data collectors to increase the amount of unclassified data
that we can make available to the TSC. The more unclassified information
we can provide, the greater the likelihood of achieving positive matches
and the lower the possibility of false positives.

Second, we will be receiving additional FBI officers this spring and
will subsequently be adding to the database records on U.S. persons
known or appropriately suspected of being involved in international
terrorism. Third, under HSPD-6 the State Department is developing a
proposal for enhancing cooperation with certain foreign governments to
establish access to their terrorism screening information.

And fourth, we have under development and will deploy this summer the
initial version of a far more powerful database that will bring together
all the disparate streams of international terrorist identities
information. Operating with vastly more fields, all data will be
XML-tagged and will be postured to incorporate biometrics. Significant
program resource growth accompanies this initiative.

Mr. Chairman, these initiatives are critically important because this is
a very hard problem. Despite our best efforts, a names-based terrorist
identification system has inherent limitations. Under any circumstances,
the potential for false positives is high. With foreign names and
particularly with Arabic names, the challenges are even greater. For
instance, the transliteration of Arab names is a very inexact science.
Spelling can vary and the protocols for which particular names are
actually used can be difficult for Westerners to understand.

Couple this with the standard terrorist use of nicknames, alias, noms de
guerre and increasingly sophisticated forgeries and the analytic
challenge for the intelligence, law enforcement and homeland security
community becomes increasingly complex. Moreover, we are dealing with an
enemy that is focused on recruiting Westerners, women and generally,
quote unquote, "clean" individuals who haven't yet come to our
attention.

Finally, as we have seen with the Transit Without Visa program,
terrorists are always looking to exploit potential vulnerabilities that
might give them a further edge. For all these reasons, the community is
leveraging experience to build new organizations, develop new methods
and techniques and deploy advanced technologies and tools that are
required to respond to this exceptionally difficult challenge.

That brings me to the third and final issue I want to briefly address
this afternoon, the subject of information sharing. There is no question
that TTIC's ability to establish and maintain a database of known and
suspected terrorists is directly related to a free flow of relevant
information across the government. While there is undoubtedly room for
improvement, substantial progress has been made since 9/11.

To begin with, a solid legal and policy framework for information
sharing has been put in place since 2001. The PATRIOT Act, the Homeland
Security Act, the presidential decision to create TTIC, the Information
Sharing Memorandum of Understanding and HSPD-6 have all played a
critical role in driving the improvements in sharing terrorism related
information.

A few metrics provide a useful comparison. First, we have seen a
substantial growth in reporting on terrorism and WMD matters in the last
two years, roughly 250 percent. In September '01, we received
approximately 900 cables per day. In January '04, that figure had grown
to about 2,200 per day. The second useful metric relates to the use of
ORCON, originator controlled information. This can be a major impediment
to the free flow of information. In September '01, over 11 percent of
all our reporting was ORCON. In January '04, that figure had fallen to
roughly 6 percent.

And the third useful metric relates to the use of tear lines, the means
by which material that must remain ORCON is nevertheless sanitized to
allow for further dissemination. From September '01 to January '04, tear
line utilization increased almost by 70 percent in the community.

Is information sharing fixed? Certainly not, but huge strides have been
made. Indeed, one reflection of that progress can be seen in the ability
to electronically access terrorist related information. For the past
eight months of our existence, TTIC has focused on the technical
initiatives necessary to promote information sharing and in August of
last year, we launched the TTIC online website. This serves as a means
to access a broad range of terrorism threat information. This highly
secure capability can reach virtually the entire structure of the
federal government boasting over 2,500 users currently in the joint
worldwide intelligence communication system's top secret environment.

TTIC online reaches traditional intelligence community terrorism
analytic elements but also the joint terrorism task forces, all our
military commands and numerous other organizations that have a need for
terrorism threat information, for example, the Departments of Interior
and Agriculture.

The success of TTIC Online can be seen by a comparison with the
analogous capability that existed in 2001. The user base is almost six
times greater, five times as many organizations participate. The average
number of document hits per week has grown by 400 times, and the total
repository of documents has grown from one to three million. We
anticipate even greater success when we deploy a new secret level
version on SIPRNET later this year. Subsequently, TTIC plans to deploy a
sensitive but unclassified presence of TTIC Online on the Open Source
Information System network.

In summary, Mr. Chairman, TTIC continues to work with our partners
across the government to implement the President's vision and to ensure
that the most accurate data on known and suspected terrorists is made
available to the TSC and many other organizations involved in border
security and the war on terrorism. I hope you will agree that we have
made demonstrable progress in both the creation of a single database as
well as the ongoing effort to share relevant information across the
government.

Given the complexity of the analytic problem, as well as the challenge
of integrating diffuse data sets from a wide range of organizations, we
undoubtedly had a great deal to do. Nevertheless, in our eight months of
existence, TTIC has already accomplished a great deal, and we have both
a sound plan and I believe adequate resources for the future. Thank you
for the opportunity to testify and I look forward to your questions.

MR. KEAN: Thank you, Mr. Travers.

Ms. Bucella.

DONNA A. BUCELLA: Good afternoon, Chairman Kean and members of the
Commission. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the missions and
objectives of the new Terrorist Screening Center. The Terrorist
Screening Center was created to consolidate terrorist watchlists for
multiple agencies and provide 24/7 operational support for all federal,
state and local law enforcement officers across the country and around
the world. When fully operational, the TSC will dramatically increase
our ability to ensure that we are working off the same unified
comprehensive set of anti-terrorist information. This is an enormous
task and it requires cooperation and coordination from multiple
agencies.

Pursuant to the September 16th Homeland Security Presidential Directive
6, the FBI administers the TSC with support from the intelligence
community and the Departments of State, Homeland Security and Justice.
Each of these agencies have representatives assigned to the TSC. The TSC
was required to begin operations by December 1st. We met that goal and
became a single coordination point for terrorist screening data. Today
the TSC has the ability to make the names and identifying information of
terrorists known to or suspected by the United States government
accessible to all law enforcement.

We have a system for reviewing whether a known or suspected terrorist
should be included in or deleted from additional screening processes.
The TSC's initial capabilities are limited, due to the need to integrate
records ensuring that all data about suspected terrorists is accurate.
Each agency contributing data to the TSC is using its own database.
These databases, which were created to support the mission of the
individual agencies, are in many instances their case management
systems, not terrorist watchlists. By this summer, the TSC will have a
single consolidated database. And before the end of this year, the TSC
will have an even more dynamic database, thereby allowing private sector
agencies and foreign governments to submit a list of persons to the
United States government to identify possible terrorists.

Our database will be continuously updated. The TSC allows the
consolidation of information currently held by multiple agencies and
used in different ways to be brought together for a single purpose: to
help identify and detain potential terrorists. The TSC is supplied with
information from two avenues. One, all international terrorist
information from the Terrorist Threat Integration Center, TTIC; and two,
all domestic terrorist information from the FBI. The TSC will then
consolidate this identifying information from these records and make it
accessible for queries from state, federal and local agencies.

When a government agency makes a recommendation to include a name in our
database, it is reviewed and instructions are provided as to how an
encounter with this individual will be handled by a United States
government agency. The system is tailored to give different
instructions, depending on where the encounter takes place, either
outside, inside or at our borders.

Let me take a moment to describe for you a typical process at the
border. When a passenger arrives in the United States and is a possible
match to the TSC record, Customs and Border Protection contacts the TSC
for assistance in the identification process. Taking advantage of its
electronic access to all information contained in the FBI and TTIC
databases, we attempt to determine if that person is a positive match.
If there is a positive match, the TSC telephonically conferences in the
FBI's counterterrorism watch for specific instructions about what
appropriate action may be taken. Such specific instructions may include
arrest, detain or question the individual further.

In the case of a police inquiry, by querying the National Crime
Information Center, NCIC, database, which contains an instruction to
contact the TSC, for the very first time, a local police officer who
pulls over an individual during a routine traffic stop will now know if
the person encountered is a known or suspected terrorist. The TSC
contacts the FBI counterterrorism watch and simultaneously the watch
coordinates with the local Joint Terrorism Task Force, who will then
assist the police officer. The results of that follow-up action is then
reported back to the originating agency. The TSC will continue to
facilitate the feedback back to TTIC and other appropriate agencies.

We recognize with all these capabilities also comes a responsibility to
ensure that we continue to protect our civil liberties. The TSC has
absolutely no independent authority to conduct intelligence collection
or other operations. In fact, we don't collect information at all. We
only receive information collected by other agencies with a pre-existing
authority to do so, each with their own policies and procedures to
protect privacy rights and civil liberties. The handling and use of
information, including U.S. person information, is governed by the same
statutory, regulatory and constitutional requirements, as if the
information was not to be concluded in TSC managed database.

Our primary mission is to ensure that terrorist identities are located
in one place. The structures which are also in place also ensure that
information about U.S. persons that has been determined to be purely
domestic information does not go through the TTIC but is placed directly
into the TSC by the FBI. Also, the attorney general has been directed to
implement procedures and safeguards regarding information about U.S.
persons in coordination with the other government agencies.

We are also committed to addressing the issues and inconveniences
arising from the misidentifications of persons under previous
watchlisting practices. Procedures are in place to review and promptly
adjust or delete erroneous or outdated information, and several such
records have already been identified and updated or removed. The
creation of the TSC marks a significant step forward in protecting
America's communities and families by detecting, disrupting or
preempting terrorist threats. The TSC builds on the improvements to U.S.
watchlist capabilities that began following the horrific events of
September 11th.

The TSC is already contributing to nationwide efforts to keep terrorists
out of the United States and locate those who may already be in our
country. The TSC will be able to fulfill this mission more effectively
and efficiently after we receive full operating capability later this
calendar year. I appreciate the Commission's interest in the TSC's
activities and would be happy to answer any questions the Commission may
have.

MR. KEAN: Thank you very much.

Commissioner Gorelick.

MS. GORELICK: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

First of all, let me thank the members of the panel. Several of you are
known to me and I very much appreciate your service to the country. I'd
like to make a comment at the outset. We heard from the two staff
statements that we've heard so far today that there were many
opportunities to stop the 9/11 plot, and the focus of those statements
has been on, number one, lack of communication among the CIA or even
within the CIA and between it and the FBI, the NSA, the State
Department, particularly consular affairs.

Second, that there was no systematic mechanism for tracking terrorists.
And third, and overarching, a failure to think strategically about what
the terrorists need in order to proceed, and particularly how to deprive
them of what they needed in the way of freedom to travel. And I would
like to focus, however briefly, on all three of those. You are here to
tell us what has been fixed, and we very much appreciate the efforts
that the three of you and your agencies have been making to try to fix a
number of problems that have been identified.

It is clear that we will have suggestions and ideas about elements of
what you're doing that remain broken and that could be fixed further,
but we are quite constrained in talking about that in open session,
because it's the last thing that we want to do, is to provide a roadmap
to where the seams still may be that could be exploited, if you will.
So, I'm going to forbear from that and we will follow those
conversations in closed sessions.

I'd like to begin with Associate Director Travers. As I noted, the
salient point I think of the staff statement was that we as a government
had a failure of strategic management of our effort to stop al Qaeda.
There wasn't one person who was accountable; there wasn't one person who
said this is my job, I'm the quarterback, here are the assets at my
disposal and here's how we're going to proceed.

As you noted, TTIC has been stood up with great fanfare. Not every
agency gets mentioned in the State of the Union address, and it is
featured as an answer to the question how are we better working together
today than we were in the past? And for that reason I would like to
really pursue with you what it is that TTIC does and doesn't do. I was
very interested in the briefing that you gave to our staff in which
you're very clear that TTIC, quote, "Does not engage in collection or
operations and does not belong to any department or agency."

And I put that against the statement by the director of the CIA's al
Qaeda unit, that he didn't think it was his job to direct what should be
done in the field, and I put that next to Pavitt's statement that it was
everybody's job. My question to you is, is TTIC the answer to that
problem? Is it the entity that directs or controls the investigation of
al Qaeda right now?

MR. TRAVERS: TTIC is an analytic organization and, as you accurately
quoted, we don't do collection and we don't do operations. Those are the
province of other parts of the government. So we certainly do track al
Qaeda and we look at plots and the development of those plots and so
forth, but there is a division of responsibility in terms of the various
functions that you mentioned.

MS. GORELICK: So you are on the receiving end of other agencies efforts
and you try to meld them together. Would that be a fair description of
what you do?

MR. TRAVERS: That is certainly true we can -- where we identify
intelligence gaps we can levy requirements on the collectors to go out
and collect information on various gaps that we may have on knowledge
base, but other than that, yes ma'am.

MS. GORELICK: Well, to the extent that we are in a war and the other
side appears to be fairly well coordinated, the question is are we as
well coordinated and if it isn't TTIC that is running operations against
al Qaeda, who in our government is responsible for making those
strategic judgments and directions?

MR. TRAVERS: I mean, I think there are a few objective realities out
there in terms of the blurring of distinctions between foreign and
domestic and intel and ops and indeed many different parts of the
government have got various responsibilities for the global war on
terrorism. With respect to TTIC itself, there is a degree of ambiguity
between our mission and some other analytic organizations within the
government, I think it's fair to say that there are -- these are being
worked through within the government, how much should be done at the
departmental level, how much should be done within TTIC.

I think we have to acknowledge that these are very difficult questions
that we're dealing with, legacy organizations and responsibilities and
we are all trying to work them out to the whatever the good governance
solution is. But I mean it's certainly fair to say that there is an
ambiguity there.

MS. GORELICK: Thank you for the candor of that response. I noticed in
your testimony that, as you noted, you are dependent upon the
constituent agencies to share with you the information that they have so
that you can get it into your TTIC database, which is now the inheritor
of TIPOFF and that therefore you can then feed the Terrorist Screening
Center, and I was quite surprised to read that -- in your testimony that
to date, only 16 of the 56 FBI field officers have completed reviews of
their -- they data they have extant as to -- in order to take the names
from their files and provide them to you. Is that a correct statement?

MR. TRAVERS: You'd have to check with the FBI to give the exact figure.
You need to understand that what they've been asked to do is to go back
13 years and look at all previous international terrorism cases through
1990 and provide us an assessment of whether individuals in those cases
need to be in our database. But it is not a trivial question and I
believe this -- they've only been working on this for a few months, I
mean, it came out of HSPD-6.

MS. GORELICK: So, in other words, prior to a few months ago there was
not an effort on the part of the FBI to share with the government as a
whole the information it had in its files about terrorists in historical
cases?

MR. TRAVERS: Again, the whole issue of U.S. persons data being in
intelligence community databases was an issue and we believe we've
clarified that and the HSPD makes it quite clear that we're to include
appropriate U.S. persons data in our database, since that decision and
clearly goes back to the Patriot Act, and that process is being worked.

MS. GORELICK: Before TIPOFF moved from the State Department over to you,
it's my understanding that the State Department was in fact unable to
reach an agreement with the FBI, under which the FBI would provide the
information in its files, is that correct?

MR. TRAVERS: I wouldn't be able to answer that question.

MS. GORELICK: Let me turn for a moment to Ambassador Harty. You've
described additional training that you were undertaking for consular
officers, and we heard this morning that the interview process pre-9/11
was summary, to say the least, and in some cases non-existent. When your
process is complete for consular officers on interviews, how long do you
expect an interview will take?

MS. HARTY: Thanks for the question, because I think that there's a
pretty broad answer and a wide range of answers to that, as you probably
expected me to say. The -- first I'd like to say that you're right, as I
have briefly detailed, the training has changed dramatically for us. We
have put an emphasis on that interview because we want to be able to
drill down through an individual's story by asking questions that that
individual's persona, by the documents they present to us, by the way
they present themselves, gives us pause and gives rise to questions we
wouldn't normally be able to ask, or drill down through if we were
simply looking at a package of papers.

I've traveled to some probably 25 posts in the time I've been on the
job, and again and again the officers on the line who have a pretty hard
job and who are patriots in doing it say they prefer to see the people
than see the paper. Having said that, quite naturally I think it fair to
say we would spend considerably less time on a 67-year-old Norwegian
grandmother than we might spend on a 20-year-old young man who had -- no
story didn't sort of hold water and for whom we had sort of an abundance
of questions and an abundance of caution. We'll take less time with the
grandmother and take as much time as we need with the individual who
gives us pause.

MS. GORELICK: So you expect to have results from these interviews?

MS. HARTY: I do.

MS. GORELICK: You do?

MS. HARTY: I do.

MS. GORELICK: If someone comes through a country that's in the Visa
Waiver Program there is no interview, is that correct?

MS. HARTY: That's correct, if they're coming for, sort of the needs and
bounds of the Visa Waiver Program, that's tourists 90 days or less. If
they're coming for other reasons they're students, they're people coming
for a longer stay of some sort, for business reasons, they in fact have
to go through a regular visa process.

MS. GORELICK: But if I've applied for a tourist visa --

MS. HARTY: If you're coming to Disneyworld for 10 days, yes, you do not
need at this point, an interview.

MS. GORELICK: So there's no interview, and so even today there are
literally millions of visitors coming to this country with no interview
process, is that correct?

MS. HARTY: From the 27 visa waiver countries, that's in fact true.

MS. GORELICK: Now, as I understand it, the statute that permits these
countries to remain in the Visa Waiver Program and thus all of those
visitors to come in without the process that you've described and the
process that you're trying to enhance, conditions their continuation on
the country having a biometric passport scheme, is that correct?

MS. HARTY: That's right, by October 26, 2004.

MS. GORELICK: And what are the chances of any of those countries meeting
that deadline?

MS. HARTY: Very few will make it. Very few at this point have indicated
to us that they will have an ability to do that. In fact, I feel it
really necessary to say that the decision on what the biometric would be
-- the statute gave the decision, if you will, to ICAO and that decision
was made last May, and so those countries have not had that much time to
do it. There are robust efforts in place to put such programs in place,
but most will not be ready by October 26, 2004.

MS. GORELICK: When do you expect them to be ready?

MS. HARTY: It differs from country to country. Some say by the end of
2005, most actually -- the larger ones say probably by the end of 2005
or early 2006, which means that we'll be able to begin issuing but not
in the volume that we would like to see, certainly.

MS. GORELICK: So between now and that time, to the extent that people
come in without the interview process that you've described, that will
continue for several more years?

MS. HARTY: Well, they will --

MS. GORELICK: If the statute is extended.

MS. HARTY: Well, until 26 October '04, that is the case. But I would
like to say as well that, while they do not have the visa interview at
an embassy, they do in fact have an interview at a port of entry, and
that is in fact -- an inspector has the same information that a consular
officer has overseas, access to the consular officers CLASS database,
access to IBIS, access to the same information that we would see during
an interview and can ask the same kind of questions should the so
desire.

The 27 countries in the program have had to face sort of a rigorous
definition of their own abilities to issue valuable documentation. We --
the 27 countries that are in the program are in fact in the program
because their travelers, it has been assessed over the course of time,
are a much lower risk than others from other countries. So it is a
program that has been assessed from its very inception and continues to
be assessed regularly, an obligation that originally belonging to the
Justice Department now belongs to Department of Homeland Security.

As a matter of fact, since the inception of the program, several
countries have been bounced because they failed to continue to maintain
that level of confidence that we have in the program in the countries
that are participating.

MS. GORELICK: But we know that there are countries like Germany and
France, just to pick two, or U.K. to pick a third, that have active al
Qaeda cells operating in them and that yet they are under this Visa
Waiver Program. What would happen if the statutory deadline were really
enforced and therefore the Visa Waiver Program were to end? What --
could you function?

MS. HARTY: If the statutory deadline were to remain in place and
countries were unable on an individual basis to continue to participate
or to comply with the program as it exists, we estimate that we would
see an approximate 5.3 million additional visa interviews that would
need to be done. That's -- that would be a daunting, daunting challenge
for us, given our current resources. We would not be able to in fact
fulfill those obligations to the best -- to the way we would want to do
it.

The GAO wrote about this just a couple of years ago, as they talked
about the Visa Waiver Program and they in fact estimated that for the
year 2000, visa waiver travelers spent about $39.6 billion in this
country and that's about 57 percent of overseas tourist spending in this
country. The GAO also went on to say that it would take the State
Department between two and four years to ramp up to be able to meet the
necessary workload. Having said that, it would be a difficult management
challenge for us to have to bridge the gap to hire and train and perhaps
even build brick and mortar facilities to interview people to bridge the
gap between the October 26,'04 deadline and the time when the countries
would be able to come online, because it's not really on a toggle
switch, they are on a trajectory. They are going to continue to try and
meet the bounds of that program just as quickly as they can, so we are
talking about a challenge with a, sort of a, you know, finite --

MS. GORELICK: Do U.S. passports meet the conditions that we would impose
on other countries?

MS. HARTY: U.S. passports do not meet the conditions we would impose on
other countries, nor are -- nor does the law require that. Having said
that, we have every expectation that reciprocity would be fairly
rigorously enforced, and so we have, as I sort of briefly mentioned in
my opening remarks, we have a plan for what we're calling the
intelligent passport -- I've got a sample of it here.

The intelligent passport has in the front of it the photo digitization
process that I originally discussed. I know you can't see it from here
but I'll happily show it to you later. But in the back of it -- in fact
we envision it having a contact- list chip embedded in the back of the
passport with an antenna, so that you could at a port of entry -- at a
U.S. port of entry or overseas, access this documentation quite rapidly.
It would have the same information currently as is on the biographic
page of the passport and it would function not unlike a speed pass at a
tollbooth, so it would be a very quick process through the system.

MS. GORELICK: But how far off is this in reality?

MS. HARTY: Well, actually I'm glad you asked that question.

MS. GORELICK: Like the one you have in your hand?

MS. HARTY: Yeah, the one I have in my hand. We will begin by the end of
'05 to begin to be able to produce these, but also not mass produce them
-- we have some procurement issues. Happy to talk about that to you. As
we try and stay a step ahead of the people who would do us harm, in some
ways we juggle with the difficulties as we have all described with
sharing information and making current systems talk to each other. We
have procurement issues too, and the rules of procurement and the rules
that allow us to access new technology sometimes cause us to be very
hidebound by processes that we would like to move along that much more
quickly.

MS. GORELICK: You need to check names against essentially the terrorist
screening center list, but as I understand it under the Condor program
you were also required to check any essentially Arab males against a
list, against an FBI list. Is that correct?

MS. HARTY: Yes. Condor was one of -- Condor is one of a number of
different kinds of name checks we do with other agencies, yes.

MS. GORELICK: How many checks have you done to date?

MS. HARTY: Approximately 125,000.

MS. GORELICK: Have you had any hits?

MS. HARTY: We have had a number of hits, but none of them resulted in a
finding of a terrorist through the running of a Condor name check.

MS. GORELICK: And are there -- as I understand it there is yet a group
of people who have neither been denied nor permitted to come in --

MS. HARTY: Yes, that's right.

MS. GORELICK: -- who are in limbo, is that correct?

MS. HARTY: That's also right.

MS. GORELICK: What is your advice to this commission as to whether that
program should be maintained?

MS. HARTY: Thank you for asking. What I would like to do is work very,
very hard with my colleagues at this table to make sure that our systems
work just exactly as they have described as quickly as they possibly
can, at which point I would make a run at Condor and say that if all of
the information is in fact contained in the databases stored at TTIC and
TSC, I'm not entirely sure and not convinced at all, in fact, that we
would continue to need to do a separate name check. If it's all in
there, then it's all in there but I'm reluctant to pull the plug until
we're up and running as complete and total partners. It's a little bit
off, but I will not be shy about that -- 125,000 anythings is a lot and
we need to make sure that we're spending our resources as appropriately
as possible. We could be doing something different with that time.

MS. GORELICK: Thank you for that, for that answer. I think it tells us
where we need to go with that. A quick question for my former colleague,
Donna Bucella who couldn't be a better person in a tough job, so I'm
very pleased to see that you have been tapped for this difficult
coalescence of many functions. My question for you is this: you are now
substituting for a unit at the State Department that used to respond to
consular officers who had someone problematic or potentially problematic
in front of them, and they could call a fellow colleague in the State
Department and say what do we do?

My understanding is that that group provided pretty good customer
service, that is it made it its business to get it back and not leave
issues hanging and to coordinate across government to make sure that the
answers got back to the consular official sitting there with a person or
a piece of paper. What -- how confident are you that moving this service
to the FBI which is known as an enforcement agency, not a service
agency, to return to my colleague, Secretary Lehman's theme of this
morning, how confident are you that the FBI can provide that service to
our consular officers?

MS. BUCELLA: Well, fortunately those colleagues are now my colleagues,
because they physically are housed at with the TSC, and so there has not
been a degradation of service and I know that Ambassador Harty and I
talked about this when we were setting up that as long there was no
degradation of service. In fact I believe we've been able to enhance the
service, and I'll tell you why.

One is many of these agencies, while on the books you know how each
another operates, but when you see them in action, it's very, very
different. And we have been able to really learn from our State
Department colleagues, the center that we have access to now, we have
access to all of the TIPOFF information, for example. All of the
different assignees, whether they're from the Secret Service, the FBI,
they have the ability now, because they've been trained, to go into the
TIPOFF database.

As well, the people from the State Department have access to be able to
go into FBI's ACS and the text IBIS database, so we really are sharing
the information and it really is a cooperative effort, in that if we
find that we need more information or different types of information, or
for example, if we have the reach back authority to go back to the State
Department, we could actually go back to TTIC and say, we need more
information. And so, we actually have all the parties that need that
information to go back and articulate what it is that we need.

The TSC database is an identities database so we have the names, we do
not have the background files, but the way we are setup we have the
accessibility to go back to those files and then ask our State
Department colleagues, what does this mean? And it's right there and
it's real-time.

MS. GORELICK: One final question. One of your jobs is to make available
a tool that local law enforcement can use. There are nearly a million
law enforcement personnel in this country. How are you going to ensure
the integrity of that database and that a terrorist doesn't figure out a
way to pulse the database to see if he's in it?

MS. BUCELLA: Right now we've been up in operation for a little less than
two months. Many of our customers really are the state and locals. We
don't have a database so we just have accessibility, we worry about
verification and authentication. In developing our database such that
state and locals as well as other federal agencies can sort of dip in
and pull information out of our database, we're going to sit down with
our colleagues from both federal state agencies to figure out what the
requirements are. We need to have a verification process such that the
local law enforcement can't call on their cell phone because we won't be
able to verify that. That are some of the requirements we have been
talking about, exactly how we accomplish that, and in many instances
we're going to accomplish it as we've done through the NCIC. But again,
there are some vulnerabilities that we have to address in creating our
branded database.

MS. GORELICK: I'm glad to hear that it's top of mine. Thank you very
much.

MR. KEAN: Senator Gorton?

MR. GORTON: Each of you has been a part, in the last more than two
years, of a response to 9/11 in an attempt to substantially to improve
the ability of the United States to anticipate and frustrate future
9/11's and I know each of you regards it as a process which is long from
being done. But each of you has testified to believing that major steps
forward have been taken. I want to ask each of you to use his or her
imagination and because you're not collectors to assume that no
additional information or intelligence were available but that all of
the reforms that you have participated in had been -- were in place on
9/11. Interagency communication among agencies or the like, the whole
rest of the works. What would you rate our chances under those
circumstances of having been able to frustrate or to prevent 9/11 from
taking place?

MR. TRAVERS: I have absolutely no idea. I listened to the staff
statement quite closely, recognizing two years ago I didn't follow this,
I've learned a great deal in the last year plus, of the watchlisting
challenges that went on. I can only deal with the subject from sort of
the perspective of an analyst and I've listened to sort of the
connections and they make sense to me. But again, we're talking about
thousands of pieces of traffic that come across people's desks and
they're all trying very hard, as the staff suggested, to do their jobs
and all it takes is one breakable link and you may lose the trail.

This analysis business is really hard and I am -- I have a great deal of
sympathy for the argument that dealing with transnational issues
generally cuts across so many different organizations of the
intelligence community and indeed the U.S. government writ large that
I'm not personally convinced that it would have made a substantially
better chance. I mean, we are certainly sharing information and I think
that in the context of the intelligence community we are training people
to do watchlisting better and make sure that we get all the names but
there are, as I suggested in my statement, a lot of ways around
watchlistings as well, so -- that's all I'll say.

MS. HARTY: I have to agree with Russ. I also don't have any idea and I
certainly wouldn't present to you, sir, that everything we've done has
made us a foolproof operation. But speaking not only for my colleagues
who are adjudicating visas every day but for all of the hundreds of
people I've met in the last two years who have together wrapped their
brains around these issues and stepped up to the challenges, there isn't
a person out there that doesn't want every day in every way to make it
the tightest system possible.

I do believe that that's the genesis of the kinds of changes we've made
in the order in which we've made them, to close as many vulnerabilities
and holes and knit up as many different ways as we can. Would it have
gotten us to a different place on September 11th, I don't know. Like
Russ, I listened very carefully to Mr. Zelikow's statement and greatly
saddened as we all were by it and what we could see now, those are
teaching moments for all of us, we will continue to apply our efforts to
doing the very best job we can.

MS. BUCELLA: I, of course, would echo what my colleagues have said, but
there are too many ifs. I can tell you that I was out of the United
States government for about a year and when I came back, the
cooperation, the visible cooperation and the tone has totally changed
after 9/11. And we have a lot more work to do, but we actually have
people sitting around the table and trying to articulate and go through
the processes, not as to what they should be doing, but how they
actually are operating, and we on a daily basis, clearly at my center
with the cooperation of all of the assignees there, are constantly
trying to figure out ways of, is there a hole here, how are we not
communicating?

And then we regularly hear, between Maura, Russ and I as well as a
number of other people in different agencies, meet pretty routinely just
trying to figure out how can we improve? The process will never be over
because we'll always look for ways to fill the gaps and to improve.

MR. GORTON: So, each of you as a very dedicated public servant, was
putting his or her full time into the kind of challenges that we're
facing, can't really tell us whether all of the work that you have done
and that your colleagues have done, would have substantially increased
our ability to prevent 9/11 based on exactly the amount of information
we had then? One of our challenges, one of the things we're asked to do,
is to make a determination as to whether or not the system in effect at
9/11, you know, should not have been able to do better, and to prevent
it.

So you can see the frustration we have, the investment that the people
of the United States have made in you and I know that what you're doing
is very substantial. But you have no way of telling us we would have had
a -- even a substantially better chance of preventing 9/11 if everything
you'd have done had been in place then? That's the summary of your
answers as well as I can understand them. Is that correct?

MR. TRAVERS: Times change, sir. I absolutely believe that the
interagency model is the right one from the TTIC perspective. And I
certainly believe that the amount of information sharing is just plain
good government and the fact that we are bringing all these databases
together is almost a blinding flash of the obvious, frankly. Those are
all good things, but I can also tell you that terrorists are responding
to what we are doing and they're getting smarter in their own way and we
could talk about that at length off line, sir, if you'd like?

MR. GORTON: Well, I thank you very much for your candid answers.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. KEAN: Congressman Hamilton?

MR. HAMILTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

We heard a lot this morning about inadequate budgets and a lot better
jobs could be done if the budgets had been a lot larger and so I want to
ask each of you, given the responsibilities that you have in your
particular areas, is your budget satisfactory?

MS. HARTY: If I might speak first, sir? Secretary Powell's Diplomatic
Readiness Initiative has given an ability to hire considerably more
people than we would have been able to at another time, we're delighted
by that. The State Department's budget this year does envision several
different additional ways of collecting fees that we could keep and I
could use and I would -- I'm obviously quite supportive of that budget
and hopeful that it will bear fruit for us in the way we need it to.

MR. HAMILTON: Is the budget sufficient?

MS. HARTY: Yes, sir.

MR. HAMILTON: Mr. Travers?

MR. TRAVERS: I'm not a budget expert, sir. TTIC does not have a budget
because we are not legislated. And that may be the wrong way of saying
it, but we are an interagency joint venture so as a result we are
borrowing people. They are assigned to TTIC. I'm a DIA officer. I'm paid
by DIA as my assignee colleagues are paid by their home organizations. I
can certainly say that we have a substantial amount of money and feel
quite comfortable that we're going to bring on our database, for
example, on time, on schedule.

MR. HAMILTON: Do you believe your resources are sufficient?

MR. TRAVERS: Yes, sir, right now I do for this year, yes.

MR. HAMILTON: Ms. Bucella?

MS. BUCELLA: Yes, TSC also operates by each of the different agencies
donating money to the TSC. Since we've only been in operation about a
month and a half, almost two months, we have not only the financial
aspect comes from all the different agencies that are assigned to us,
but also my manpower is my two deputies. One is from DHS and one is from
the State Department, and currently under our two month longevity so
far, I believe that we have adequate funding.

MR. HAMILTON: Ms. Harty, I work at an institution now where I deal with
a lot of academics. This is kind of the flipside of the problem we've
been talking about here: we all want to stop terrorists coming in. But I
hear a lot of anecdotal evidence from scientists and from researchers,
from students, about how tough it is to get into the country. And I know
you're very familiar with this problem and I know a number of university
presidents -- the chairman, I think will confirm this -- that are deeply
worried about the flow of people into the country. They're very
important to us, of course, that they come in. How do you -- what can
you tell us about this? We've always got this tough problem of balancing
openness and security, just a matter of hitting the right balance.

MS. HARTY: It certainly is, sir, it's one of the many balances we try
and strike on a daily basis. Secretary Powell describes it as a balance
between secure borders and open doors. No one in the consular field or
in any of our fields will do anything ever but put security as job one.
And having said that, we have a requirement to look at the other side
too, and the definition of security might in fact be more broad than we
sometimes think. In part, that definition of security I think includes
the economic security of the nation.

We have, for instance, an $88 billion travel and tourism industry. We
have a $12 billion international student industry; one out of every
seven civilian adults employed in this country is employed in some facet
of the travel and tourism industry. When those young people choose to go
somewhere else for their education, we lose a generation. I have a
colleague who's our ambassador in Islamabad, and she told me that this
past summer some 6,000 students, Pakistani students, opted for studies
in the United Kingdom. Normally in previous years they'd issue visas to
about 2,000 students, and I look at that and I say that too is a
security problem for us.

When students choose to go somewhere else, they're choosing for
themselves at that moment in time certainly, they're choosing for their
younger brothers and sisters, they're probably choosing for their
children at a later date, they're certainly choosing who they want to do
business with at a later date when they are then sort of leaders in
their civic or civil societies. It is a concern of ours. Secretary
Powell has said since September 11th itself, we cannot erect a gate
around America that terrorists win again. It is however a balance we
have to strike.

When I came into the job there were tremendous backlogs, tremendous
backlogs mostly engendered by a variety of new name checks and a series
of systems that could not speak to each other. We have whacked that way
back in almost all cases. For instance, now it's only about 2 percent of
all cases worldwide that need in fact an additional Washington based
name check. Over time, as we mentioned, with respect to the Condor
program, over time when we are completely up and running and feel very
good about every element of our new partnership with TTIC and TSC. Maybe
we can trim that down even further.

At embassies now, any embassy you go to, there are programs in place to
allow a medical emergency, a student with a valid I-20 and a ticking
clock, so here she needs to get to their place of education, and a
business person with an emergency to move to the front of the line. Out
of the 211 visa adjudicating posts around the world, only fewer than 30
have more than a 30-day wait to get an appointment anyway.

MR. HAMILTON: I don't know what the data is, but I do know that there is
a very intense feeling in the academic community generally that we
haven't got the balance struck right yet and that I hear stories about
thousands of students who would ordinarily come to the United States are
now planning not to come to the United States but to go elsewhere.
Perhaps not a big deal --

MS. HARTY: Oh, sir, excuse me for talking, I think it's a terribly big
deal. The Institute for International Education, I believe, did a report
earlier this summer and it in fact indicated that the growth rate of
foreign students to the United States was in fact smaller than anybody
wanted or anticipated. The overall number of students in the country was
still a little bit higher than previous years.

MR. HAMILTON: I know you've got a tough problem here. I'm glad to know
you're sensitive to it. We do indeed want to keep terrorists out, but
there are an awful lot of good people we want to let in.

MS. HARTY: I couldn't agree with you more, sir.

MR. HAMILTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. KEAN: Commissioner Fielding?

MR. FIELDING: First, I'd like to thank you all as well, not only for
your service but for appearing here today, and for the candor of some of
your answers. They're not exactly always what we want to hear, but we do
want to hear your candor. My fellow commissioners have covered a lot of
the ground that I wanted to deal with, in particular though we all would
yearn to have the ability to know not only that there's coordinating
body that can now assemble all these facts, but there will be a body
that can connect those dots, to use the overused phrase, so anything
that anyone can give us, either in these sessions or maybe more
appropriately, much more appropriately in private sessions, the
Commission would welcome and would like to extend that charge to you, if
we could.

In specific regard to just clearing up a few things, I must say, Ms.
Bucella, I need your help on something, because good old Washington, if
there is any way that there's a division of responsibility or if there's
any power shifting around, there's the temptation to duplicate effort
and to replicate task. And you said that in your testimony, I believe
you said it's good terrorism information is now in one place. But now,
as I understand it, TSC checks intelligence that's gathered from
agencies against terrorist watchlists?

MS. BUCELLA: What we do is we have the terrorist identities information.
There is -- it would be the name of the terrorist and a few other
identifiers. We do not maintain the actual file or background
information about that. That information is still maintained by all the
gathering agencies, the originating agencies. So what we have is the
location of knowing the names and identities of the terrorists.

MR. FIELDING: Okay then, bear with me just a little here. DHS had a
press release and they said that the majority of information received
from you comes from TTIC. After it's assembled and analyzed the
information from numerous sources then it ends up going to you. Now, if
TTIC gathers most of the information and was created to bridge the gap
we all sense between foreign and domestic gathering sources, and you
receive the information from the FBI and it receives information from
the FBI as well, why isn't TSC simply located in TTIC? What added
benefit is achieved by you being located in the FBI? If any.

MS. BUCELLA: I don't know if I have an answer to that, since I -- the
creation of the TSC came out of HSPD-6. But the information that we have
comes from two different sources. The domestic terrorism information
comes from the FBI. That is not sitting at TTIC. The international
terrorist information goes through the TTIC. So there are two trunks of
information coming in. That information though is again only the
identities of terrorists that are known and suspected. The background
information still resides at TTIC.

MS. GORELICK: Excuse me, if I could just interrupt. When you say
domestic, you mean non-terrorism related. In other words, the FBI's
information on terrorists, that is, people who are in the United States
but have some relationship with terrorism would go to TTIC. Is that
correct?

MS. BUCELLA: Not if they were abortion bombers or something.

MS. GORELICK: No. I'm saying if they were related to international
terrorists.

MS. BUCELLA: That's correct, yes.

MS. GORELICK: So the only piece -- just to clarify here, the only piece
that TSC has that TTIC wouldn't have would be what we call a domestic
terrorist, an abortion clinic bomber or the Oklahoma City model militia
terrorist?

MR. FIELDING: Do you agree? Am I missing something here? You see what my
question was?

MR. TRAVERS: TTIC is an analytic organization. We have no operational
function whatsoever so that a decision to -- we will nominate to a
watchlist but Donna's people will decide whether or not it meets the
criteria and will put it on the watchlist and interact with CT watchlist
and so forth. We don't do that.

MR. FIELDING: Well, okay.

Ambassador Harty, just let me ask a follow-up question. We're dealing
unfortunately with what-ifs all the time here. One of the areas that
really was troublesome in analyzing what's happened on 9/11 was the
whole visa applicant issue. The questioning of applicants in Saudi
Arabia has caused problems of concern. So I guess, a couple part
question to you. Have the changes in interview policies since 9/11
changed that as well? Are you now interviewing far more these applicants
and are there any examples you can help us to demonstrate whether this
is leading to anything positive?

And the other side of that, I would like to also say, one of the major
concerns was that people were getting visas without really giving
fulsome information or even complete information. Are you satisfied now
that there is a policy and an implementation policy that now differs
today so that that would not happen again under ordinary circumstances?

MS. HARTY: Yes, sir. Thank you for the question. With respect to changes
in visa interview policy, we, last August, put into place a policy that
had already, in the immediate aftermath of September 11th, begun
informally by many, many posts and that is we see just about everybody
now. The reasons for that or that we believe the interview is a useful
thing to do, as I said earlier, to sort of drill down through a story.
The other part of this is we have a congressional mandate to collect a
biometric feature to embed in a non-immigrant visa. And so we are seeing
people because we are also taking a digital sort of scan of their
fingerprints. So we are seeing almost everybody. The exceptions concord
with the exceptions given by DHS at ports of entry, younger than 14,
older than 79.

With respect to your question, whether or not we have anything to show
for it. You didn't put that way. I will. The real truth is when you see
people and you can drill down through a story, you may not, certainly
almost never, if ever, at the end of an interview, say, Yep, that was a
terrorist. I got him. What you do say is what you heard that inspector
say earlier today. Somebody gives you pause. Somebody, in his words,
gives you the creeps. Somebody's story doesn't concord with the reality.
You know, speaking the language and living in that country, that
somebody doesn't get the right to go to America and that's a very useful
thing to do in an interview.

MR. FIELDING: Great. Thank you all very much.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. KEAN: Commissioner Ben-Veniste.

MR. BEN-VENISTE Thank you and thank you to members of the panel for your
contribution here today and in working with our staff. I have a question
first for Mr. Travers. You've indicated that there is some ambiguity
with respect to the job that you're trying to perform at TTIC and the
analytic efforts of others within the government and you mentioned that
some of the legacy organizations may not be on board. I would like you
to elaborate on that if you would be kind enough to do so.

MR. TRAVERS: I didn't mean to imply that there were legacy organizations
that weren't on board. My point was that you can go back in the National
Security Act and you've got a whole bunch of departments and
organizations and agencies that have been around a very long while. They
have got missions for which they need intelligence. We have TTIC that is
now extant as an interagency joint venture that will try to bring
together terrorist threat warning material.

What responsibilities should devolve from some of these other
organizations to TTIC, what should stay put? I don't believe that there
is a clear cut answer to that question. There is no doubt that CTC needs
operational support. There is no doubt that the DOD organization needs
force protection support from its terrorist analytic organization. So
there are no bright red lines, I think, that allow one to decide this
should go there, this should stay here. That was my only point.

MR. BEN-VENISTE Well, I guess the issue we're struggling with is what
has been frequently called stovepiping or turf or owning information.
There is a natural tendency, at least among men, maybe not so much among
women -- I'm probably going to get in trouble for saying this. I'm glad
to see that two of the representatives of these agencies now are women
who, according to others who have studied this subject suggest they are
more inclined to share information into personal relationships.

But to be very serious about this, part of the problem has been the
inability of one agency which develops information to provide that
information to another agency which did not develop it but which may
well use it for the common good. That's exactly the reason why TTIC was
created. The question is whether it's functioning as it was intended,
whether you're getting the kind of cooperation that you ought to get.
Would you agree with me that the only way in which that function can be
made viable is by leadership from the very top of the government?
Someone has to tell the agencies, Look, don't just pay mouth service to
this. You've got to do it.

MR. TRAVERS: I don't believe that's what's happening, sir. I mean, we've
had the Information Sharing Memorandum of Understanding, for example.
Puts a positive duty on organizations to share with TTIC information.
Again, getting back to the notion of legacy systems, we've got
architectures out there that -- my personal desk has five CPUs under it.
I have a whole host of organizations piping information to me. We have
some security policy questions that preclude us from being able to do
federated search across all those CPUs and so we are having to work
through those details.

But I don't -- I won't sit here and suggest that the heart is not
willing. We have had FBI over the last six months bringing FBI Net into
our system. As I suggested, they are providing for us all this
historical data. They're going to provide people on our floor, working
for Mike Resnick, my database guy, to make sure that we're including all
of the international terrorism individuals that they suspect. So I don't
think it's a question frankly of a willingness to share information.

MR. BEN-VENISTE What about on the follow-up side? You're receiving
information. You're analyzing it. You have no operational capability.
But clearly a function of an intelligence analytical operation is the
ability to direct the follow-up or the future collection of intelligence
information. What is your function and experience with respect to that
and is that running as smoothly or as vigorously as you would like?

MR. TRAVERS: Recognizing that we're still a relatively young
organization, just since last summer, but the -- Charlie Allen, the DCI
for collection, has placed an individual into TTIC to do just exactly
that. We have a collection manager in TTIC who works on a daily basis
with the analyst to ensure that collection requirements are being
registered with the appropriate collector, and we will compete quite
well, I'm convinced, against all of the other collection requirements
that are out there.

MR. BEN-VENISTE So are you saying that it is functioning in a way that
you are well satisfied with?

MR. TRAVERS: As I said a number of times in my statement, we have a long
ways to go. The issue of how we bring together foreign intelligence
collection requirements and domestic intelligence collection
requirements is new business for this government. And so we have not yet
fixed that problem, but we are certainly working it.

MR. BEN-VENISTE But in terms of your ability to communicate your
collection needs and the responsiveness of those with whom that
collection request is charged, is that functioning well or is that among
the areas in which you are ambivalent in your praise?

MR. TRAVERS: On every priority list that this government has, terrorism
is at the top. And so while I have not -- I couldn't sit here and give
you examples of how a TTIC intelligence collection requirement stacked
up against the Pacific Command intelligence collection requirement if
the collector was the same, I can say with a great deal of confidence
that TTIC would do very well.

MR. BEN-VENISTE Ambassador Harty, let me ask you a question that I put
early to Mary Ryan, and that is whether you have discovered in the
course of your service in the consular office that there are -- that
there is an issue with respect to the integrity of translators used in
the visa application process in various locations throughout the world
where you do not have native language speakers performing the consular
functions.

MS. HARTY: The short answer is no. I do not -- I'm not aware of any
systemic problem that way. But there are a couple of things I'd like to
add if I might, sir. First is when I came into the job, we sent a cable
to all ambassadors all around the world and said, please look at the
language requirements of every officer at that embassy, with specific
reference to the consular section, and make sure that we are sending out
language qualified officers at the level you believe you ought to have.
Number one.

Number two, in those posts where we do in fact use native speakers as
interpreters, there's a number of anti-fraud, anti-malfeasance steps
that should and ought to be taken, and I believe in most places where
there might be an issue or where we do have native speakers serving as
translators, we do do. And that is you rotate them. You avoid all
patterns of predictable behavior so that any given interpreter today
doesn't know which officer they're going to work with tomorrow, which
window they're going to sit at after lunch, and so that you are
constantly sort of mixing the field so that there isn't any way for
anybody to really sort of plan who they're going to interview, how
they're going to interview.

But I think there's no substitute for training all Foreign Service
Officers in the languages that they need to do the job. They're living
in a country. They are simply better when they speak that language well
to the very best of their abilities.

MR. BEN-VENISTE Let me ask you, if there are no systemic problems with
regard to the corruption or corruptibility of translators, are there
anecdotal instances with which you're familiar?

MS. HARTY: No, sir. I have to say I'm not. I can certainly find out for
you. It seems you may know something I don't know, but don't have a
story.

MR. BEN-VENISTE Well, as I say, we've received anecdotal information
about it. I'm not suggesting it's systemic. Korea is a country which has
been mentioned. There are others that it's specifically mentioned where
for a relatively modest amount of money a virtual lock on a visa can be
purchased. That's the information we've received, and not from people
unacquainted with the system.

MS. HARTY: I will certainly, sir, look at that. There are very few
things we take more seriously than malfeasance, and the Bureau of
Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Consular Affairs since Assistant
Secretary Taylor and I came on board have a robust partnership in
ferreting it out, in exonerating people who ought to be exonerated, and
in punishing swiftly those who ought to be punished.

MR. BEN-VENISTE I'm pleased to hear that. Let me just finish by asking
you whether it is feasible to train consular officers in foreign
languages of their assignment, given the rotation and the fact that they
will be moving to other posts.

MS. HARTY: Yes, sir, I think it is. One of the things that has also
changed are some of the rules as to how much language training an
officer can get before they go to post. Junior officers have five years,
during which time -- the first five years of their employment is the
time that they are under a tenure process. In pre-9/11 times it used to
be that you could only get a certain amount of language training, I
think it was six months, during the five years, because they wanted to
make sure that you had an ability to demonstrate how you were going to
do on the job.

The Office of Personnel, Foreign Service Institute have changed those
rules, have moved those meets and bans. We need to give people the
language they need to do the job. Physical presence isn't enough. You
have to be able to do the job.

MR. BEN-VENISTE That's encouraging. Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Congressman Roemer, then Senator Kerrey.

MR. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I want to go back to Ambassador Harty's initial remarks when she opened
up our hearing, thank her for acknowledging the very valuable
contributions that the 9/11 families have made, both to this commission
and to the type of questions we sometimes ask in these open hearings.
And I think it's safe to say that we probably wouldn't be here as a
commission if it weren't for the 9/11 families' fierce determination and
hard work. We certainly would not have gotten the funding increase that
we requested several months ago.

And I'm hopeful that this commission will forcefully and aggressively
ask for an extension so that we can complete our business, and I'm
hopeful that those families will help us in that effort to make sure
that we can definitively write the account of the plot of 9/11 and work
in a bipartisan way to make recommendations to make this country safer.
You acknowledged that participation by 9/11 families in your opening
statement and I want to thank you for that.

One of the issues that they've been very interested in has been the
reports about a plane that left a few days after 9/11 that had a number
of Saudis on it that was cleared out of our airspace and had members of
the bin Laden family. Are any of the three of you aware of this? Have
you requested after-action reports on this planeload of Saudis that
left? What do you know about it?

MS. HARTY: I'm sorry, Commissioner Roemer, I don't have any knowledge of
that. I'm happy to try and find out if it's in State's purview, but I
don't have any knowledge of that.

MR. TRAVERS: Nor do I.

MS. BUCELLA: I don't.

MR. ROEMER: We've heard reports that they left a few days after 9/11.
There have been even some reports, I don't know if they're accurate or
not, that this happened on the 15th or 16th. I'd be interested in if you
could task back to your agencies, if you all have asked to interview any
of those Saudis that left our country a few days after 9/11, whether or
not the FBI accompanied the people to the plane, to the airport. I'd be
interested in any after-action reports that your agencies have on this
and who might have approved the plane leaving U.S. airspace. If you
could help us with that we would greatly appreciate it.

On a different note, Mr. Travers, with respect to privacy, here's an
issue that Americans care deeply about. On the one hand, we want to make
sure that the terrorists are not successful in their next attack on
America. On the other hand, we greatly respect our civil liberties and
our civil rights, and we need that balance. One of the few people that
has lost a job since 9/11 has been a man by the name of John Poindexter,
who started a program called Total Information Awareness.

I know you in your statement addressed advanced analytical tools and the
role they can play in helping us watchlist people. I think that there
are some positive things that we might be able to ascertain and develop
as a result of some of these programs, but I also think that we have to
be very, very careful what we label them and how we work them and task
them, and that we balance these with the respect for civil rights and
civil liberties that is firmly enshrined in our documents in this
country. What if any part is your organization trying to take from this
initial development of Total Information Awareness and how can you
explain the value of this in a positive way as an analytical tool to
people watching today?

MR. TRAVERS: The tools themselves, from my perspective, are benign. The
question is what information streams go into the tools and you can
envision a number of different cases. On the one extreme, we could have
our intelligence community databases that could be -- the information
could be compared to one another to look for patterns or linkages that,
as I suggested, with in excess of 2,000 cables per day plus everything
in history, it is beyond the realm of reason to think that any
intelligence analyst by himself or herself would be able to in fact draw
linkages. Did that phone number match that phone number, or whatever?

So you do need very powerful tools to do that. My own thinking would be
that, if you're entirely on the intelligence community side, then this
really is no problem at all. This is all foreign intelligence
information that we are passing to determine linkages. If you have a
linkage with a U.S. person, now our ability to query a transactional
database, for example, from a known --

MR. ROEMER: What's a transactional one?

MR. TRAVERS: Credit card databases or something along those lines, we
wouldn't do but we could ask the foreign terrorist tracking task force
to do that or we could in essence throw it over the transom to determine
if there's a linkage back to the United States and then we could have
that data because there's a nexus to terrorism. There's a 12333
exception and I think we're fine as far as our view of privacy would be.

The hard question gets to be how do you bring together databases that
have foreign intelligence information but then information with U.S.
persons that isn't such a transactional database. You can't bring those
all together because there, there is clearly problems with privacy and
so what I think large numbers of people in the private sector and the
government are trying to think through is can you anonymize data? Is
there a way that you can in fact benefit from the power of technology
and bring together these streams of information but still be completely
in accord with all the privacy concerns which we share? I can all tell
you that we're bending over backwards not to go too far in that
direction.

MR. ROEMER: So the long and short of it is you are trying to develop
some firewalls to protect those transactional accounts --

MR. TRAVERS: Absolutely, yeah.

MR. ROEMER: -- but you are moving in some of the same directions that
that terrorist awareness program or total information program began.

MR. TRAVERS: There are a number of programs that will help us do data
mining and I talk about data mining in TIA in sort of the same general
phraseology and certainly the intelligence community believes we need to
do these things. But right now, we're focusing on only using foreign
intelligence now trying to decide, trying to work with the attorneys to
decide how far we can go or can't go with respect to U.S. persons data.

MR. ROEMER: Those firewalls are certainly very important to this
commission and the American people and if you could provide in writing
for the Commission a more specific and thorough listing of the databases
and the transactional accounts and the program that you're developing, I
would appreciate it.

MR. TRAVERS: Sure.

MR. ROEMER: Thank you, sir.

MR. KEAN: Senator Kerrey and then last questions from Secretary Lehman.

MR. KERREY: Mr. Travers, I'm going to come at this question that you've
been asked in three or four different ways. I'm going to try and ask it
somewhat differently. But it gets down to who do you report to and what
kind of accountability do we have in the system? If Ambassador Harty
issues a visa, if somebody out there gets a visa and comes to the United
States and does something bad, she's going to be up in front of both the
House and the Senate, Foreign and International Affairs Committee. She's
going to be up there testifying and asking why she isn't resigning, et
cetera. The heat will go on her immediately. Who do you report to on the
other hand?

It seems like you got a situation where everybody reports to their own
individual bosses. They come into this center -- you, for example, you
are a DIA employee. Number one, how do you establish the kind of
accountability relationships that you need to have in order to be able
to -- it's okay, we now know who to blame if I got a problem. Who takes
responsibility for doing it right and who takes responsibility for doing
it wrong?

MR. TRAVERS: I'm one of the day-to-day managers with John Brennan, the
director of TTIC, who responds to the DCI.

MR. KERREY: He reports to DCI?

MR. TRAVERS: Yes, sir.

MR. KERREY: So if there's a mistake either not getting somebody on a
watchlist who should be on a watchlist or getting somebody on a
watchlist who doesn't belong on a watchlist, it's Director Tenet or the
DCI's responsibility for that mistake?

MR. TRAVERS: As I said a couple of times, we are interagency. So we
bring together information that comes from a whole host of organizations
within the intelligence community and outside the intelligence community
and we are partnered with CIA, DOD, DHS and FBI.

MR. KERREY: I've heard you say that several times but now I'm putting it
to you in the form of a question. If a mistake is made and somebody is
not on a watchlist who should have been or somebody is on a watchlist
and shouldn't, do we hold Director Tenet or the DCI responsible for
that?

MR. TRAVERS: I can envision --

MR. KERREY: Do we hold you responsible for it? Do we hold DIA
responsible for it? Who do we hold responsible for it?

MR. TRAVERS: We are setting a protocol so that organizations other than
-- the watchlisting support function has been largely CIA and State
Department in the past. We are working with DIA to get all of their
names into a database, also working with --

MR. KERREY: You're saying you don't know who we hold responsible or --

MR. TRAVERS: No, I'm saying that if you can pull the string on --

MR. KERREY: I'm trying to get to a question with a yes or no as an
answer. Do I hold Tenet responsible or not?

MR. TRAVERS: I don't think it lends itself, sir, to a yes or no question
because -- a yes or no answer. You pull the string on an individual, he
may have been in a DIA IIR and that didn't get submitted for
watchlisting. So is that the director of DIA or is that the DCI? What if
it was an FBI TRRS?

MR. KERREY: Do you have any concern about an environment where
eventually I can pull the string and go into a hundred different
directions and you don't end up being able to say, well, this happened
on my watch and therefore I'm responsible for it?

MR. TRAVERS: As I suggested earlier on, sir, it is a difficult problem.
Unless you're going to put the entire counterterrorism effort under one
individual in the U.S. government -- and I don't know how you'd do that
because now you're picking up Treasury responsibilities and special ops
functions, this is a matrix managed across the government by a lot of
different people. And that I think is a fact.

MR. KERREY: I mean, currently do you report to any committee in
Congress? Do you --

MR. TRAVERS: I believe there are six committees and 17 subcommittees
that claim jurisdiction.

MR. KERREY: For you?

MR. TRAVERS: Yes.

MR. KERREY: And do you report to them? I mean, they hold hearings and
all that sort of thing on you?

MR. TRAVERS: There are varying degrees of responsiveness and I'm now out
on my own and I won't go any further than that in terms of what we
provide to the subcommittees.

MR. KERREY: Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Secretary Lehman.

MR. LEHMAN: Thank you. I have one question for Ambassador Harty. We had
an interesting discussion in this morning's panel with your predecessor
and we talked about what has been at least a 30-year decline in Consular
Affairs, a steady erosion of influence, closing of consulates around the
world in every administration, a shrinking, a diminishment of resources,
reduction of manpower, the loss of what in many periods was seen as an
elite professional consular corps and, in my experience, which again is
in about the middle of that period, a dropping out of the assistant
secretary from the crucial seventh floor meetings. In State, perhaps
more than in any other bureaucracy, where you sit is where you stand and
it was quite evident from your predecessor's fairly forthright complaint
after 9/11 that nobody told her. She didn't have the intelligence. She
wasn't in the loop and that was exactly what we got from the interviews
with the officers in Saudi Arabia. Why didn't anybody tell us?

So where are you today? The reduction of prestige in consular function
to being an entry level scut work job as opposed to a long-term
professional elite career, is that being restored? Do you sit in the
secretary's staff meetings? Are you part of the loop? Do you ask for
intelligence as opposed to waiting to have something be dropped on your
desk? Do your people feel that you are in the loop, you're a player,
that they don't have to depend on a cable.

As some of them said, "Well, you know, official doctrine was Saudi
Arabia was our close friends. So why would we look for a terrorist among
the Saudi Arabians?" I mean, if you're part of what's going on, you
think in a broader sense. And I guess, the question is, are you raising
or have you raised Consular Affairs back up to its elite-ness with
esprit and reality of being the outer defenses of this country?

MS. HARTY: Gosh, I appreciate the question and I could go on at some
lengths about this, so I thank you for it. I won't, but I'll try and
summarize very quickly, sir. It is true that in the 1990s there was a
great diminution in resources across the board at the State Department
and the resulting closure of consulates abroad affected not only
consular functions but every other function a consulate might perform.
Having said that, I am really very pleased and proud to assure you that
Secretary Powell practically charges me rent. I am there, I am at his
meetings. I was his executive secretary immediately before taking this
job.

He chose for the first time ever to put a career consular officer in the
job as assistant secretary for Consular Affairs. This is the first time
in the history of the Bureau of Consular Affairs that a consular officer
has actually run it. I think that speaks to -- although I respect all of
my predecessors who have had this job. When you have had 23 years in the
field knowing exactly what the people who work for you know, that helps
you get the job done.

A quick anecdote if I might about the spirit of the consular cone at
this point. I just came back about six weeks ago from a trip to seven
posts in the Middle East, including Baghdad, and then ended the trip in
London. At each of those posts, one or more than one non-consular
officer said to me, "Your work has meaning. It's where it's happening
now. How do we switch into the consular cone?" And I've got an e-mail
from a guy in Jakarta, asked the same thing today.

I think that we have proven that in consular work, what we do, among
other things, is touch lives. We touch the lives of private American
citizens every day as we protect and defend them overseas. We touch the
lives of American citizens who seek and need passports from us quickly
or in a rather more routine fashion.

We also touch the lives of the people who come to the embassies who seek
to immigrate or seek to visit our country. How we treat those people is
important because we need information from them about whether or not
they are legitimate travelers to our country. It's also important
because even if we refuse them a visa, they have a right to a dignified
experience and we don't have any rights to defile the reputation of the
United States by not treating them in a cordial fashion.

It is, in fact, very much where things are happening. I mentioned
Assistant Secretary Taylor a little while ago, who's our assistant
secretary for Diplomatic Security. He and Cofer Black and I are attached
at the hip on a regular basis, as are various of my counterparts at the
Department of Homeland Security, and as Donna mentioned earlier, we're
in touch all of the time. I think it is exactly the time to be in
Consular Affairs. I think an awful lot of Foreign Service Officers have
realized that, and we take all comers. It's a time to step up. It's a
time, frankly, to be a patriot, and we have an awful lot of young people
who are very interested in doing that.

MR. LEHMAN: Thank you.

MS. HARTY: Thank you, sir.

MR. KEAN: Thank you all very, very much. We appreciate the time you took
with us today and certainly appreciate your government service.

Thank you.

We've come now to our fourth panel. Our first witness will be James W.
Ziglar Senior, a former commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization
Service, Department of Justice. He formerly served as assistant
secretary of the Interior, where he's responsible for a successful
restructuring of the Bureau of Reclamation.

Following Mr. Ziglar will be Robert C. Bonner, commissioner of the U.S.
Customs Service since September 20th, 2001. On March 1st, 2003, Mr.
Bonner became the first head of the Bureau of Customs and Border
Protection in the Department of Homeland Security. He is currently
responsible for uniting all aspects of border activities, including the
U.S. Customs Service, Immigration inspectors and Border Patrol of legacy
INS, and the Agricultural inspectors from the Department of Agriculture.
He previously served as a United States district judge in California and
the administrator of the DEA.

Our last witness is Peter Verga, principal deputy assistant secretary of
Defense for Homeland Defense. Immediately following September 11th,
2001, Mr. Verga served as a special assistant for Homeland Security and
director of the Department of Defense Homeland Security Task Force.
Would you please all rise and raise your hand.

(Witnesses sworn.)

Thank you. Mr. Ziglar, you going first?

MR. JAMES ZIGLAR: Mr. Chairman and members of the Commission, I
appreciate the invitation to appear today to assist in your effort to
establish a complete and accurate record of the events leading up to
September 11th and the actions that were taken in the aftermath.

As you know, my first day of commissioner was August the 6th, 2001, one
month and five days before the attacks of September 11th. Consequently,
I have little to offer in terms of your investigation of events
occurring before September 11th. In my written testimony I have
attempted to tell the story of the INS' response to September 11th and
the story of our efforts to improve our performance in the many areas
for which we had jurisdiction. It's been 14 months since I retired from
federal service, so I hope you understand that I did not have access to
records or staff in preparing my testimony. I did my best to be as
thorough as possible with the resources and records and the time
available.

When I was first approached about the possibility of taking the
Commissioners job in March of 2001, it was explained to me that the
President was looking for someone with management experience to fulfill
two mandates. These mandates were based upon promises that the President
had made during the campaign. The first was to restructure and reform
the INS by separating the service and enforcement functions to create
more accountability, effectiveness and efficiency. The second was to
reduce the backlog of applications and petitions to an average
processing time of not more than six months.

When I entered the INS building on August the 6th, 2001, I felt a sense
of great urgency about moving forward with the restructuring. I knew
from my experience as an assistant secretary of the Interior during the
Reagan administration that moving quickly in a new job and getting
buy-in from employees for major change were necessary to success. It
worked for me in restructuring the Bureau of Reclamation and I had high
hopes that it would work here.

In my first month in the office, I spent most of my time learning about
the INS bureaucracy, directing the process of creating a restructuring
plan, and talking to and with employees about the need for fundamental
change. In fact, in my first 30 days, I met with every employee in the
Washington area through a series of group meetings and question and
answer sessions, and I used our audio and video communications
capacities to reach out to those in the field.

The restructuring task force that I put into place within the first 48
hours of joining the INS worked diligently through the month of August
to fashion a restructuring plan that met the President's goals and that
would rebuild the INS to achieve accountability and effectiveness. We
drew heavily on the work that had been done before, including a good
restructuring plan that had been proposed by Commissioner Meissner. On
September the 10th, we delivered our proposed restructuring plan to the
attorney general. September 11th obviously changed the focus of our
efforts at the INS.

From that day on we were engaged in participating in the investigation
of the events that transpired, we were working to prevent any further
terrorist attacks, we were developing and implementing new initiatives
to increase our effectiveness, and we were actively engaged in hardening
our borders to prevent the entry of terrorists into the United States.
And I use the term borders in a very broad sense.

In my written statement I have attempted to give you at least a partial
summary of the many actions that we took in these regards. The events of
September 11th itself brought home to me just how important it was to
continue the process of restructuring and reforming the INS. An
experience during those first hours after the attacks convinced me that
I could not take my eye off the ball of the restructuring. As I
mentioned in my written testimony, the INS was responsible for
suggesting to the attorney general that federal law enforcement agencies
should provide agents to supplement security at airport checkpoints.

We offered up 300 border patrol agents as the first contingent, and in
fact, we had 317 agents on the ground at nine airports, beginning within
36 hours of the attacks. When the President approved this initiative at
the suggestion of the attorney general and we set up about mobilizing
our agents, it came to my attention that the chief of the border patrol
was not actually in charge of the border patrol. You can imagine my
amazement at that. But given this reality, it was also obvious to me
that it would take days or even weeks to work our way through the
bureaucratic decision making process. I quickly suspended the
established chain of command, put the border control chief in direct
command, and we started moving agents to the airports immediately.

In April 2002, after finally receiving reprogramming authority from the
House and Senate Appropriations Committees to start the restructuring,
the first change I announced as part one -- as the first part of phase
one was the permanent realignment of the border control chain of command
to put the chief of the border control as its actual operating head. As
we were preparing to implement phase two of the restructuring, the
President announced his Homeland Security Department initiative and we
altered our process to blend in with that initiative. It was clear to me
that in the now hot war on terrorism, we had to simplify and clarify our
command and management structure, we had to impose accountability and
performance standards, and we had to upgrade and integrate our
technology.

As noted in my written testimony on September the 14th, three days after
September 11th, I gave clear directions to my senior staff that we were
not going to drop the ball on restructuring. On October 3rd we briefed
the attorney general on the plan and got his signoff to submit it to the
White House for review. On November the 14th, we submitted it to the
Congress. What this commission and the American people need to
understand and appreciate is that the scope of the duties and mandates
imposed on the INS far exceeded the resources that Congress had made
available to it for many years.

Even though the budget of the INS began to increase in the early 1990s,
primarily to hire more Border Patrol agents for the southwest border,
things such as interior enforcement, technology improvements,
integration of information systems, benefits processing, adequate
expansion of detention and removal capabilities and a host of other
important functions were the subject of neglect, benign and otherwise.
Yet even if Congress had supported and funded all of the things that
should have been done, I doubt whether that would have prevented the
events of September the 11th. The real failure was, in my personal
opinion, a failure to gather intelligence information, analyze it and
disseminate it to the points, including especially the INS and the
Department of State, where it could be used to thwart terrorists.

Since I wasn't part of the pre-September 11th structure, I can't speak
directly to those issues. However, I have a keen grasp of the obvious.
And it was abundantly obvious to me that September 11th was in most part
an intelligence failure. It's also obvious to me that the next terrorist
attack will be prevented by constantly improving our intelligence
gathering capabilities and the development of modalities for the rapid
dissemination of usable intelligence information for those on the front
line.

If our first encounter with a terrorist is when he or she comes and
shows up at the border and we don't know or suspect that he or she is a
terrorist, then we've lost the battle. As good as the people are who
work for Commissioner Bonner at Customs and Border Protection, and they
are good, they are not mind readers. They must have the information and
tools necessary to make the split-second decisions that we expect of
them, and they must be thoroughly trained to know exactly what it is
they're looking for.

In the near-term aftermath of the attacks on September 11th, we took a
number of important steps, including, among others, the identification
of the hijackers, which was a process that actually went on over several
days. It was -- the first process was just to look at the seating charts
on the airplanes, figure out who probably they were, check them against
entry records, so you had a pretty good idea, but from there then you
had to confirm who it was. And that's where, frankly, as I mentioned in
my testimony, where I saw the lack of interconnection of our information
systems, because the actual confirmation of who they were was contained
in records that were in the records center and district offices, things
like that. So we really had -- we identified them immediately but then
we really had to confirm who they were.

MR. KEAN: Start to wrap up please, Mr. Ziglar. We're running a little
long on time.

MR. ZIGLAR: I'm sorry. I beg your indulgence. I have a couple of other
things I'd love to say.

MR. KEAN: As quick as possible.

MR. ZIGLAR: The assignment of 1,000 of our special agents to the FBI. We
disseminated departure list, we deployed more inspectors to the northern
border, we accelerated the existing northern border strategy of the
Border Patrol and started to move toward reaching the 969 Border Patrol
agents that we wanted -- or we had established as a goal at the northern
border. We developed what turned out to be exactly 50 potential
initiatives for the attorney general, and we also put on warp speed the
development of our information enterprise architecture for the INS. And
I'm pleased to note that we got that done on my watch.

Perhaps the most important thing we did, though, was to go to Threat
Level One, which we did in coordination with the Customs Service. There
are a number of protocols, and I won't go through those because I'm
trying to wrap it up, sir. Needless to say, though, those -- the Threat
Level One at the border created enormous backups, and we had to work
pretty hard -- it's still a challenge I think out there -- to try to get
those backups down to not impede commerce and the flow of people across
those borders. And we worked I think very cooperatively with the Customs
Service.

The lessons from this experience for me were, one, we must develop surge
capacity at the border in order not to have events like this have such
draconian impacts. And the second is that we must move as many functions
and inspection functions as far away from the border as we possibly can
so we don't have this physical border problem that we've got. Protecting
the American people, enforcing our immigration laws and protecting our
economy are extremely important, but when these goals have impact or
perceived impact on the agendas of various groups, the goals get lost in
the noise.

Let me give you one example, because I have to take full responsibility
for this controversy. In March 2002, I propose that we should reduce the
default period of admission for B-2 visitors to 30 days form the then
existing default period of six months. In layman's language, a visitor
to the United States is usually granted admission for six months' stay
unless the immigration inspector decides to make it shorter. Generally
the six month default is what you get when you come in.

My view was that this length of stay exacerbated the problem we had with
overstays and that we made it easy for people like the 9/11 hijackers to
come in and to do their thing for six months while we didn't even know
where they were. My view was that the default period should be 30 days,
and if someone had a legitimate reason to stay longer, they would
present it to the inspector and the inspector would give them an
extended stay, but not exceeding six months. It seemed clear to me that
combining these tighter controls with an entry-exit system that would
tell us when they came and went would give us better control over the
people who came here with an intent to overstay, as well as it will put
a little tightening on the people who were here with evil intent.

The Department of Justice supported my view, and on April 22nd we
proposed those regs. You would have thought that I had committed
treason. An untold number of congressmen, governors -- no offense,
Governor -- mayors and travel industry representatives were outraged.
The horror stories about people having to sell their houses in Florida
and came from Canada because they could only stay here for 30 days, the
stories about grandparents not being able to visit their grandchildren
because they could only stay 30 days, all of these things were blown out
of proportion.

There were congressional hearings and even though we plainly stated that
people would be granted stays longer than 30 days for legitimate
reasons, the hysteria was rampant. The irony was that a lot of the
people who were bashing us for being too lax were the people that were
on our case about this one. I should note that those regulations were
withdrawn after I retired.

In closing, Mr. Chairman, I want to emphasize that our priority at the
INS during my tenure were focused on improving the performance of the
agency in the war on terrorism and in the enforcement of our immigration
laws as well as providing the services to which people are entitled
under our laws. These goals can be achieved through better management
structures, enhanced employee morale and productivity, obtaining
adequate resources and vastly improving our information technology
systems.

The achievement of these goals require patience, hard work and political
support. The implementation of programs such as SEVIS and US-VISIT won't
mean much if the whole spectrum of things that need to be done is
ignored. We can bring our immigration system under control consistent
with our legacy as a nation of immigrants and our dedication to being a
free and open society. But it will take much work and thoughtful, mature
analysis and decision-making.

Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Thank you, sir.

Mr. Bonner.

MR. ROBERT C. BONNER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the
Commission. It's a pleasure to have a chance to appear before the 9/11
Commission and to discuss with you the ways that 9/11 and the aftermath
impacted on the United States Customs, how Customs responded to 9/11 and
ultimately, the evolution, as Mr. Ziglar alluded to, of the creation of
the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Bureau within a new department of
our government.

On the morning of 9/11, I had not been confirmed yet as the Commissioner
of Customs. I was, I guess, a commissioner designate, had a temporary
office on the fourth floor of Treasury Department and with all the other
employees of Treasury, at about 9:30, 9:35 a.m., I evacuated the
Treasury Department and joined the then acting secretary of the
Treasury, Ken Dam at the Secret Service Headquarters Command Center a
few blocks away. And, once there, I did establish immediately contact
with U.S. Customs Headquarters at the Ronald Reagan building.

At about 10:05 a.m. on the morning of September 11th, U.S. Customs went
to Level 1 alert at all the ports of entry in the country and that is
the highest level of security alert short of actually shutting down the
border ports of entry. We did so, as Commissioner Ziglar indicated, in
coordination with the INS. Besides going to Level 1 alert, which, by the
way, means significantly increasing the questioning of people entering
the United States, passengers, vehicles, as well as the inspection of
vehicles and cargo, Customs also repositioned some of its Black Hawk
helicopters from the southern border with Mexico to the northeast to aid
the recovery efforts.

On the morning of 9/11, through an evaluation of data -- by the way,
this was the passing through manifest, which U.S. Customs was able to
access from the airlines -- I would say, within about an hour of 9/11
U.S. Customs Office of Intelligence had identified the 19 probable
hijackers as well as the complete list of the passengers on the
aircraft. By the way, Customs was also struck directly on 9/11. The U.S.
Customs cell in New York City was located at 6 World Trade Center. It's
an eight story building that was immediately north of the North Tower
and it was destroyed, of course, completely when the North Tower fell.
Fortunately, all 800 Customs employees in New York City that were in
that building, that worked in that building were unharmed. Of course,
the loss of our building is nothing in comparison to the thousands of
people that were murdered on the morning of 9/11.

I was confirmed on September 19th by the Senate and sworn in a few days
later. Let me just say, first of all, that it was very apparent to me
and I think many people at U.S. Customs that the agency's mission and
its future had been dramatically changed by what had happened. It
certainly was clear to me that our priority mission had changed from one
of interdiction of illegal drugs and trade regulation and the like to a
security prevention mission and, to put it very plainly and bluntly,
preventing terrorists or terrorist weapons from entering our country.

We also saw, by the way, after 9/11, on the 12th and 13th and 14th, we
saw that Level 1 alert was one thing but on the day after and the few
days after 9/11, we saw wait times go at our border ports of entry go
jump, particularly at our northern border, from about an average of 20
minutes before 9/11 at the Ambassador Bridge, for example, from Ontario
into Detroit, they jumped from 20 minutes to 12 hours overnight.

So, by September 12th, there was a 12-hour wait time which was impacting
many of the companies on our side of the borders, including auto makers
who had just in time inventories. By the way, that was across the
border. At Buffalo, the bridges over Buffalo were also 10- to 12-hour
wait times within a day or two of 9/11 as well as the bridge at Port
Huron. So we virtually shut down the borders by going to Level 1 alert.

Suffice it to say -- and I won't go into detail, it's in my testimony --
we worked with Governor Engler to get National Guard support. We worked
-- the inspectors were working 12 or 16 hours a day, seven days a week.
We TDY'd temporarily duty assigned people to the northern ports of entry
from as far away as Los Angeles. We did everything necessary to both
maintain security but by September 17th or September 18th, we had gotten
the wait times down to near where they had been prior to 9/11.

It was also clear to me that, if we were going to be able to perform our
anti-terrorism mission, that we were going to need to have advance
information about people and cargo coming into the United States. And we
did -- just very quickly, there were a couple of things that were very
important. One was, we did obtain legislation, with support of the
Administration, in the Transportation Security Act that mandated for the
first time that all airlines that were flying passengers into the United
States from abroad had to -- were required to provide the advance
passenger information with respect to everybody on that flight and also
the personal name data with respect to those passengers. That was
enacted in November of 2001 and we were able to get very fast compliance
with that law, in part by making it clear to airlines that didn't comply
with the law that Customs was going up to 100 percent inspection of all
their passengers arriving at JFK and other airports around the country.

The second thing we did was we also needed advance information
electronically with respect to cargo shipments coming into the country
and we promulgated in Customs what's called the 24-hour rule. But that
rule essentially required that Customs be given advance information with
respect to a complete information electronically with respect to all
cargo shipments, ocean-going cargo shipments that were being shipped to
the United States 24 hours before those cargo containers were loaded on
board vessels outbound from the foreign ports. Not 24 hours before
arrival into the U.S., 24 hours before they left the foreign ports for
the U.S. Similarly, under what's called the Trade Act legislation of
2002, we were able to essentially extend these advance manifest
information on cargo shipments to all other modes, commercial trucks,
rails, rail shipments and air cargo and the like.

We also, as Mr. Ziglar indicated, realized that we had to push our
border outward. We had to extend our zone of security and we did three
key things in that direction. One was to create in late 2001, November
2001, the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism. This was
essentially partnering with the private sector to get a commitment from
them to give increased supply chain security literally from the foreign
loading docks of their vendors to the U.S. borders.

In an exchange, if they met the security standards that we set out, in
exchange, we would give those companies -- we call it C-TPAT --
expedited processing through the borders of the U.S. That started off
with just seven companies, seven major importers of the U.S. in December
2001. There's over 5,000 companies that are now members of the
Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism and they represent over 40
percent of the volume by value of imports into the United States. That's
probably the largest, and I believe, most successful public-private
sector partnership that was formed out of the ashes of 9/11.

And then secondly, as an extended border program, we implemented the
Container Security Initiative. And the Container Security Initiative was
to recognize that particularly when you're talking about the terrorist
threat and potential use of a container to conceal a terrorist weapon,
even -- particularly a weapon of mass destruction -- or use the
container as a weapon, that we needed to do our targeting of cargo
containers that we're moving for the U.S., and the screening of those
containers for at least the high-risk containers, the containers that
were identified as posing a potential terrorist threat at foreign
seaports. And we proposed in January of 2002 that we start with the top
20 foreign ports, which represented almost 70 percent, over two-thirds
of all the containers coming to the United States, and that we implement
it at those ports.

And we have been able to implement the Container Security Initiative.
The countries representing 19 of the top 20 ports have agreed to
implement CSI, the Container Security Initiative, and we have in fact
implemented it at 17 foreign ports around the world. And we are
continuing, by the way, now to expand that to other ports that ship
significant volumes and are strategically located, of cargo containers
to the U.S., places like Malaysia.

Let me also just say -- it's in my testimony -- we've had some excellent
cooperation with Canada and Mexico with respect to smarter borders, that
is to say borders that add security to both the movement of people and
the movement of goods across our borders, and at the same time do it
with respect to some initiatives that actually facilitate the flow of
legitimate trade and people. These are programs like the Free and Secure
Trade Program with Canada, which we've expanded to Mexico, programs that
we worked on with the INS, the NEXUS program, which we've expanded,
which is for people who are travelling across our border who are willing
to give up basically some of their privacy to submit an application, pay
a small fee, and are vetted through the criminal and terrorist indices
of both Canada and the United States, and are personally interviewed.
And if they are determined not to pose a terrorist threat or a threat
for smuggling, they are given a proximity card and can get through the
border expeditiously.

MR. KEAN: Mr. Bonner, could you start to sum up, please?

MR. BONNER: I will. Those are a few of the initiatives that we took as
part of U.S. Customs. One of the most important initiatives actually was
the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, and within this new
department the Customs and Border Protection, which is for the first
time unifying all of the personnel or agencies that had border
responsibilities into one border agency to manage and secure the borders
of our country. We have begun to do that as of March 1, 2003, with the
stand-up to the department. That is to create what Secretary Ridge has
called one agency -- one face at the border, which is one border agency
of the federal government to manage, secure and control our borders.

And I can't tell you how important that is to our effectiveness in terms
of the terrorist threat. It is extraordinarily important to bring
together men and women like Inspector Melendez, who testified earlier
here, a former INS inspector, and people like Diana Dean, who was a
Customs inspector in the state of Washington who was responsible for
catching Ahmed Ressam, the millennium bomber.

So let me conclude my remarks with that. Mr. Chairman, thank you and the
Commission for your indulgence. I'll answer any questions you have when
we get to question time.

MR. KEAN: Thank you very much.

Mr. Verga.

MR. PETER F. VERGA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the
Commission. I appreciate the opportunity to help you with your important
work and to discuss the Department of Defense role in relation to
civilian border authorities. My comments today are distilled from the
longer, more detailed written statement I have submitted to you, and I
would ask that that written statement be made a part of the Commission's
record.

I am the principal deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Homeland
Defense, serving under Assistant Secretary Paul McHale in the Office of
the Secretary. I'm a career member of the Senior Executive Service, and
at the time of the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, I was
serving as deputy undersecretary of Defense for policy integration. Soon
after the attacks, Secretary Rumsfeld designated then secretary of the
Army, Thomas White, to manage the day-to-day execution of Homeland
Security and Defense activities in the department on a temporary basis.
And in January of 2002, I was appointed as a special assistant for
Homeland Security, managing a newly created Homeland Security Task Force
which served as a temporary bridge between the immediate post-9/11
aftermath and the establishment of new homeland defense and civil
support organizations within the department.

To provide the necessary context for my remarks, it's important to make
the distinction between homeland security and homeland defense, and the
very different but complementary roles of the Department of Defense and
the Department of Homeland Security in those activities. Stated simply,
the Defense Department provides the military defense of our nation from
all attacks that originate from abroad, while the Department of Homeland
Security aims to protect the nation against and prepare for acts of
terrorism. The Department of Defense has organized and prepared,
however, at the direction of the President and the secretary, to support
the Department of Homeland Security's mission.

In understanding DOD's activities in relation to the border, it's
important to understand that there is a nexus with DOD's support in the
counternarcotics arena and to recall a tragic incident in 1997 that had
ramifications for how that support is executed. The Department of
Defense active and Reserve component forces and the National Guard have
provided a wide variety of counternarcotics support to drug law
enforcement agencies along the southwest border of the United States
since 1989, including surface and aerial reconnaissance, minor
construction in establishing tactical observation posts, training,
intelligence analysis, linguistics support, transportation, and training
exercises along the border to provide terrain denial.

On May 20th of 1997, near the border in the vicinity of Redford, Texas,
an active duty Marine performing a counternarcotics mission tragically
killed a U.S. citizen in self-defense. Subsequently, DOD concluded that
it would no longer provide support that would place active and Reserve
component forces in situations in which confrontations with U.S.
citizens might occur. National Guard personnel acting in state status
were, however, permitted to continue to perform ground missions. It's
also important to underscore that the Homeland Security Act of 2002 now
gives the secretary of Homeland Security the responsibility for the
security of our nation's borders. And DOD's role in border security is
to provide support to those civil authorities, again, principally the
Department of Homeland Security, when appropriate.

I'd now like to respond directly to the four areas of interest related
to border security that were identified to us by the Commission. First,
what action did DOD take to secure borders immediately after the 9/11
attacks? As detailed in the written statement I've submitted, DOD
engaged in a number of actions to improve homeland defense and provide
interim support to border authorities immediately following and then in
the months after the attacks. These included, for example, Operation
Noble Eagle, which involves air patrols over key domestic locations,
U.S. Navy ships deployed off the coast, with anti-aircraft systems and
integrated air defense assets located in the National Capital Region,
deployment of National Guard troops operating under state control but
with federal funding to guard some 421 airports, and U.S. Navy support
for Coast Guard homeland security patrols and the mobilization of 1,600
National Guard troops along the southern and northern borders to support
the Customs Service, Immigration and Naturalization Service and the
Border Patrol in their heightened security postures.

The second area of interest is the strategic role of the military in
anti-terrorism, including protecting against infiltration of the United
States by terrorist groups such as al Qaeda. DOD defines anti-terrorism
as defensive measures to reduce vulnerabilities and protect U.S. forces
and assets worldwide. Anti-terrorism thus represents one element of a
broader approach to combating terrorism that also includes
counterterrorism, terrorism consequence management, and intelligence
support.

The principal focus of DOD's efforts to combat terrorism is on bringing
the fight to the terrorists abroad through the prosecution of the global
war on terrorism. The next line of defense also lies beyond the borders
of our nation, where we are patrolling the air and maritime avenues of
approach to engage terrorists before they reach our borders. In this
effort, the North American Aerospace Defense Command guards, patrols and
monitors the skies over and around Canada and the United States. And
similarly, the U.S. Navy mans the sea approaches in international waters
and works with the U.S. Coast Guard to patrol our territorial waters.

Within U.S. borders, the domestic law enforcement community is
responsible for countering terrorist threats. The Department of Defense,
of course, stands ready to provide assets and capabilities in support of
those civil authorities consistent with U.S. law.

The third area of interest is the military's role in sharing
intelligence with border inspection services. DOD policies and
directives emphasize protection of the constitutional rights and privacy
of U.S. citizens. In the absence of foreign involvement, military
intelligence organizations are limited to performing non-intelligence
functions in domestic support operations. If authorized by law to
collect foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information within
the United States, military intelligence organizations must do so only
in support of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the lead federal
agency responsible for intelligence collection within the United States.

DOD is a full partner in the Terrorist Threat Integration Center which
began operations in May 2003 and whose function it is to close the seam
between analysis of foreign and domestic intelligence on terrorism. And
additionally, United States Northern Command has a well established
links of information and intelligence sharing on border activities.
Primarily through its Joint Task Force 6, the North American Aerospace
Defense Command and the National Guard.

And similarly the National Guard in most of the 54 states and
territories supports intelligence analysis efforts of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Department of Homeland Security, Bureau of Customs and Border Protection
and various federal, state and local task forces. DOD is also now
installing secure Internet systems in many of the high intensity drug
trafficking areas intelligence centers to facilitate information sharing
that has national security and homeland security value.

The last area of interest I was requested to address is the role of the
military in civil support in emergency preparedness in conjunction with
U.S. land and sea border inspection and enforcement authorities. As
noted earlier, DOD's role vis-à-vis border security is to support civil
authorities, again primarily the Department of Homeland Security, when
requested. If the President or the secretary of Defense so direct,
NORTHCOM will lead DOD's response to request for assistance from those
lead federal agencies for border security operations.

DOD also plays a supporting role through developing and maintaining good
bilateral federal defense relationships with our neighbors. To the
south, the U.S. has a positive high level relationship with the Mexican
military and U.S.-Mexican civil cooperation along our shared border is
well established. To the north, we enjoy a close cooperative
relationship with Canada across the board, to include the areas of
counterterrorism, consequence management and aerospace warning and
defense.

At the strategic level, the Permanent Joint Board on Defense epitomizes
our close bilateral ties. At the operational level, that long standing
North American Aerospace Defense Command is a clear illustration of our
bi-national commitment to counter aerospace threats to North America. In
addition, a new bi-national planning group was established in Colorado
Springs in December of 2002. That planning group is working to improve
U.S.-Canada arrangements to defend against maritime threats to North
American continent and respond to land-based attacks as well as civil
support operations.

Maritime homeland security is the responsibility of the Department of
Homeland Security as the lead federal agency, and is executed by the
U.S. Coast Guard. Again, when directed by the President or the secretary
of Defense, United States Northern Command will respond to requests for
assistance to augment Coast Guard maritime security operations. The
Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, the Coast Guard
and the U.S. Navy are working together to establish a layered approach
to maritime defense and security. In that same vein, the Department of
Defense remains involved in supporting Coast Guard in port security and
maritime domain awareness.

Today we face a challenge that is equal to or greater than any we have
ever faced before. Once we could readily identify and defeat our enemy
in conventional warfare. Today we must cope not only with the threats
produced by proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile
technology among nation-states, but also with threats posed by
individual terrorists and terrorist organizations with global reach. The
Department of Defense has a long tradition of support to civil
authorities, including border authorities while maintaining its primary
mission of fighting and winning the nation's wars.

As long as terrorist networks continue to recruit new members, plan and
execute attacks against U.S. national interests and seek out weapons of
mass destruction, U.S. military forces and other DOD assets will remain
engaged. Our goals are to thwart terrorist operations, disrupt their
plans, destroy their networks and deter others who might consider such
attacks on our nation. U.S. military forces stand ready to defend and
protect our homeland in overseas and domestic operations. I look forward
to answering any questions you may have.

MR. KEAN: Thank you all, very much.

Commissioner Ben-Veniste?

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Thank you, gentlemen, for your testimony here today.

I'd like to start with Mr. Ziglar, if I may. I was particularly
interested in your analysis of the failures as you perceived them that
led up to the 9/11 catastrophe. And indeed I have made statements from
time to time from this vantage point about the fact that we had a
considerable amount of collected intelligence prior to 9/11, but it
seems as though our failures involved the inability to disseminate and
utilize that information in a way in which we could interdict those
individuals who participated in the 9/11 plot.

And so particularly since I agree with you, I'm very interested in that
analysis. I'd like to ask you, in the run up to September 11th, we have
received a great deal of information about the type, the quality and the
volume of information that was being received by our intelligence
community, indicating that something big was going to happen. Admittedly
the emphasis in looking at this information was toward an attack on U.S.
interests on foreign soil, but clearly the intelligence community did
not and could not and would not rule out the possibility of a violent
attack on the homeland.

Let me ask you, sir, whether you were advised or to the best of your
knowledge INS was advised that we were in the summer of 2001 in a
heightened period of alert, with respect to the possibility of Jihad-est
or Islamic fundamentalist terrorist activity?

MR. ZIGLAR: The answer, sir, is that I was not briefed or advised that
there was any particular concern at the time, nor am I aware of anyone
in our national security unit or intelligence folks being aware of that.
If they were, I'm not aware of it.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: What makes this particularly troublesome is the fact
that from June 1, 2001, forward nine, at least nine, of the participants
in the catastrophe of 9/11 entered into the United States. Nine of them
came in after June 1, 2001. During this period of increased, certainly
in the midst of this increased volume and quality of potential terrorist
activity, and nine, at least, came in between April and May. Now, had
you been a partner, putting aside an equal partner, at least a recipient
of the kind of information that was setting the hair on fire of other
people elsewhere in the government because of the dramatic nature of
this information, what might you have been able to do?

MR. ZIGLAR: Of course, you're asking me a question, a hypothetical
question because I wasn't there, but if I had known we had information
about specific individuals and specific threats, I think the first thing
we would have done immediately is to put that information into what was
called NAILS --

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Well, let's take that off the table because clearly
with the exception of two individuals who were not watchlisted, there
was no specific information that was within the databank of the U.S.
However, as you have heard this morning or maybe you haven't?

MR. ZIGLAR: I'm sorry, I wasn't here.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: But our staff has developed a very broad and detailed
analysis of the travel documents that were utilized as well as the
profiles of the individuals, had you been notified that you were in a
situation -- that we were in a situation of high alert during this
period, could you have taken steps that might have interdicted any of
these individuals?

MR. ZIGLAR: Well, I certainly think that the field operations people
would have put out an alert to all inspectors that there is a heightened
concern and that we would have probably at that point put a whole lot
more people into secondary for both questioning and inspection of their
documents, it would seem to me that would be a fundamental thing that
you would do. You would also go out to all the district offices for your
special agents internally and put out the word that there was a high
alert, then if you had a name or something that that would go to the top
of the priority list of people that they would be looking for.

I mean, those would be the normal course of events sort of things. We
had a national security unit, or have -- I guess we still have it, I
assume, a national security unit there that was responsible for working
with the field on particularly national security kinds of cases, they
would have been activated in a very targeted way.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Let me ask you about 9/11 itself and immediate
aftermath. One of the things that occurred in the immediate aftermath
was the order from the attorney general to take steps with respect to
foreign visitors in this country who had in one way or another been in
violation of their immigration status. Let me ask you whether you took a
position with respect to this program?

MR. ZIGLAR: Yes, sir, I did. I suggested that it needed to be targeted
to those folks that we had some kind of reasonable suspicion to believe
might have some kind of connections first that we should avoid the
appearance of being involved in any kind of harassment or sweep or
roundup or any of that sort of thing, for some very fundamental fairness
reasons, but also because I thought that it would probably scare the
community, that we would be looking for to cooperate with us, so I did
express that point of view.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: You saw a blanket effort to detain individuals who were
out of status as counterproductive because of its general scope?

MR. ZIGLAR: I thought it had the potential of being counterproductive,
yes, sir.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And did you express a view with respect to its
legality?

MR. ZIGLAR: Yes, sir.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Let me read from your statement, at page 15. "A public
record has been established indicating that INS personnel, including me,
raised questions and concerns about the appropriateness of certain
policies and practices that were being pursued by the Department of
Justice in the investigation. I considered it my duty to raise my hand
when I felt that the bounds of law were being approached, or where a
practice or policy was ineffective, ill-advised or violated notions of
fundamental fairness. I make no apologies for doing what I believed to
be my duty."

You go on to say, "We have a long history in our country, particularly
in times of crisis, of incorrectly assuming that there is a clear nexus
between immigration and terrorism or anarchy. Our public discourse needs
to be better informed. This commission bears a particular burden in that
respect." I agree with you. Would you like to elaborate on that point?

MR. ZIGLAR: I think it says what I feel, sir. I'm not sure I could
elaborate on it.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Can you tell us on the basis of your observation of how
that policy was carried out, whether there were any terrorists or
suspected terrorists who were arrested in connection with that sweep?

MR. ZIGLAR: I'm not aware of any.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Let me turn to Mr. Bonner, if I may. Obviously mindful
of what I think Commissioner Gorelick has earlier indicated in this day,
long day of hearing, that we're not going to obviously talk about
specific instances where our staff or we have perceived holes, in the
procedures, practices or policies that are now in place, but let me ask
you generally with respect to container security, which you have brought
up in your statement. It has been widely discussed that only a very,
very small percentage of shipping containers coming into this country
from foreign ports are physically inspected. Can you provide some
details with respect to that and whether there is a program underfoot to
increase the physical inspection of shipping containers?

MR. BONNER: Be happy to. First of all, there's sort of a -- one of the
urban myths is that there're 2 percent of the containers approximately
that come into the U.S. are inspected and the reality is, of course,
we've been increasing the rate of our inspections, but the premise, the
underlying premise for our inspection is a risk management one. That
posits with the right strategic intelligence, the right anomaly
analysis, the right detection equipment, you don't necessarily have to
inspect all containers coming into the U.S.

If we have to do that, we don't have the resources to do it and I think
it actually would be rather foolish, a waste of resources. But basically
I can tell you that if you take all cargo shipments which basically
would be both trucks and ocean going cargo containers, the number is
close to 10 percent.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And if you limited yourself to ocean going containers?

MR. BONNER: If you limit it to ocean going containers, it's between four
and 5 percent, I mean, it goes up and down, it varies. But I will hasten
to add, as I think you know, Mr. Ben-Veniste, that the premise here is
that we actually get information on all containers that come into the
United States before they arrive. We do an analysis of those containers,
we select out the ones that we think pose a potential risk for the
terrorist threat and we screen through both radiation detection and
large scale imaging equipment 100 percent of those containers.

Now, with CSI of course we're doing more and more of that, not just on
arrival at USC ports, but where we have CSI in place, doing it at the
outbound ports before they're even loaded on board vessels to the U.S.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: So is it fair to say that since 9/11 the percentage,
the quantity of shipping containers from overseas ports have increased?

MR. BONNER: Yes, unquestionably. Probably in the order of doubled or
tripled.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: So, pre-9/11 it might have been about 2 percent and now
it's 4 or 5?

MR. BONNER: But by the way, I don't know that it was 2 percent before
9/11, I mean I don't know where the figure comes from.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Well, if it's 4 percent now and it's doubled --

MR. BONNER: But I feel confident that it's increased by 100 percent and
I actually think it may well be more than that.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Do you have a goal, a target --

MR. BONNER: Yes.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: -- as to the -- where you'd want to be, can you share
that with us?

MR. BONNER: Yes. The goal is screen and do a security inspection for 100
percent of all containers that we identify as potentially risky for the
terrorist threat, and I believe we are doing that, that's the goal and I
think we're either doing it or close to doing it at ports of arrival
into the U.S. and we're now through the extended border strategy being
able to do that more at foreign sea ports before they're shipped to the
U.S.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Do I understand you to say that you are at your target
now?

MR. BONNER: We are -- yes, I think we are at or close to our target,
which is to say that one thing I didn't mention in my testimony for a
lack of time is that one of the things we set up in October 2001 for the
first time in the history of Customs, was a national targeting center to
target all containers, who also gets all the information on arriving
passengers too, but all containers that are coming to the U.S. and
essentially taking strategic intelligence and developing targeting
rules, there are 150, 200 targeting rules in the system to score and
target for potential threat.

It doesn't mean they are an actual terrorist threat, but because of a
variety of factors, we have identified those containers that pose a
potential security threat, terrorist threat. And with respect to those,
we are, I believe, we are screening 100 percent, every one of those
we've identified as a potential terrorist threat according to our
targeting rules that have been set up through the targeting center by
U.S. Customs. By the way, it's a 24/7 watch that takes all this
information and essentially evaluates it and analyzes it through these
rules.

Now, by the way, we need -- we are a consumer of intelligence and it's
not just tactical specific intelligence, what container or what person
may be a terrorist. But we are a consumer of strategic intelligence too
and so, some of our rules are formed by what we get through the
intelligence community and the FBI to inform us just on how we set our
rules. That's the methodology. It's a risk management methodology to
identify every container that poses a potential risk and then make sure
every container is screened for security purposes.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: I must say that I had the occasion to observe border
security operation by the Customs service at the Niagara Falls
U.S.-Canadian crossing and was very impressed with the dedication of the
individuals who were working there and the level of instruction that
they had obviously received. Let me ask you this. With respect to the
inspections that you have conducted with respect to both land and sea
containers since 9/11, have you interdicted any containers that would be
regarded as directed toward terrorist activities in the United States?

MR. BONNER: I can't say that there are any that are directly related to
terrorist activities. We have interdicted containers that have contained
automatic weapons. We have interdicted containers that contained
essentially chemical, anti-chemical exposure kinds of suits and things
like that. But I can't say that they're directly connected with
terrorism. But I can say that the system works. I'd also say, since you
were up at Niagara, you also saw -- I believe you saw that there are
portal radiation monitors there for the -- coming across those bridges,
both trucks and passenger vehicles.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: I did.

MR. BONNER: They didn't exist on 9/11. So we're getting a radiation read
on every vehicle, truck and passenger vehicle. We also have deployed,
which didn't exist on 9/11, large scale X-ray imaging machines so we can
do whole container truck X-rays and images which we didn't have on 9/11.
We've done that. We've put these in place on the northern border and sea
ports of the country and the like. So --

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Getting a lot of hits on cancer patients who --

MR. BONNER: We do get some hits on cancer patients occasionally that are
in vehicles crossing the Mexican or the northern border.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Let me ask you briefly about your statement about the
day on 9/11 which I found very interesting. You say that, on the morning
of 9/11, through an evaluation of data related to the passenger manifest
of the four terrorist hijacked aircraft, Customs Office of Intelligence
was able to identify the likely terrorist hijackers within 45 minutes of
the attack, Customs forwarded the passenger lists with the names of the
victims and 19 probable hijackers to the FBI and the intelligence
community. How are your people able to do that?

MR. BONNER: Well, it was pretty simple actually. We were able to pull
from the airlines the passenger manifest for each of the four flights.
We ran the manifest through the TECS/IBIS system. This is essentially
the lookout system that both U.S. Customs and INS use but it's
maintained by Customs. We ran it through the system. Two of the
passengers on those aircraft were hits for having been entered on the
watchlist in August of 2001. That was al Mihdhar and I forget the other
one's name but they were the two people that had gone to Singapore that
the CIA had identified. But they actually were put on the watchlist in
August of 2001 by the FBI. So they hit on those two.

Just using those two hits and taking a look at some other basic data
about the flight manifest, both in terms of -- I don't want to go into a
lot of detail -- but where they were seated, where they purchased their
tickets, you could do just a quick link analysis and essentially, I
remember I was at Secret Service headquarters, as I said, but I would
say whether it was 45 minutes, I don't know but my recollection is that
certainly by 11:00 a.m., I'd seen a sheet that essentially identified
the 19 probable hijackers. And in fact, they turned out to be, based
upon further follow-up in detailed investigation, to be the 19.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Was this more than looking at the two who were hits and
then checking out the other Arab names?

MR. BONNER: It was partly that, by the way, but it was more than that.
No, it was seat location, ticket purchase information. Again, I am on
public record here. I don't want to go into exact details since we use
some of this information in terms of targeting today for potential
terrorists. We actually use, as I was saying, advance passenger
information to identify beyond just who's on the watch list by biography
to try to do a more intelligent job as to who, as the combined
immigration inspection and Customs inspection, Customs and Border
Protection who would you ask a few questions to as they're arriving in
the United States.

So you're doing more than just looking at a watch list. You're looking
at a lot of data and trying to figure out who to look at, just as in the
same way we're looking at what cargo to look at by examining a multitude
of factors. That is, to some extent, strategic intelligence driven. So
it was looking at a bunch of relational data. Obviously, more refinement
of that occurred later but it was -- it didn't take a lot to do, just
sort of what I'd say a rudimentary link analysis to identify essentially
all 19.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: With respect to Mr. Verga, obviously we don't have time
to go into the -- we could spend the whole day certainly or more on each
of your areas of expertise. But I'm interested in the question of the
use of the military within the continental United States and in your
statement, you indicated that there were several statutory exceptions to
the Posse Comitatus Act, including Public Law 10740, authorizing the
President utilizing military force to prevent further terrorist acts
against the nation. And in that regard, I wasn't familiar with it but I
found that this was a law passed by Congress seven days after 9/11 and
I'd be interested to hear from you how the Department of Defense feels
that this is a modification or exemption to the Posse Comitatus Act.

MR. VERGA: First, let me stipulate I'm not an attorney and I would --
obviously for an official DOD legal reading on any interpretation of the
law, I would defer to our general counsel. My understanding is that the
Posse Comitatus Act provides that military forces may not be used to
enforce civil law except as otherwise provided by Congress through the
enactment of any other legislation. I believe that our view of that
particular statute is that it was not limited to overseas use of the
military forces and therefore it could be construed to in fact be an
exception to the Posse Comitatus law as enacted by Congress. But, as I
said, I would defer either to a former DOD general counsel who is a
member of the Commission or to our current general counsel for an
official reading on this.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: I would ask that, if it were possible, something be
submitted in writing as to that interpretation.

MR. VERGA: Sure.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: I'm also interested in the mission that you've
indicated with respect to NORTHCOM. NORTHCOM has, if I understand
correctly, it has -- and the military has, for some time, assisted in
the interdiction of narcotics traffic into the United States either by
plane or vessel. Do you interpret the mandate of NORTHCOM now to provide
similar assistance with respect to anti-terrorist activities?

MR. VERGA: You very correctly state that the Department of Defense is by
law the lead federal agency for the interdiction of air and maritime
drug traffic into the United States. United States Northern Command
operates -- part of their subordinate elements are Joint Task Force 6,
located in El Paso, Texas, which orchestrates the military's involvement
in that activity, along with our joint interagency task forces, east and
west, which also help work the interagency aspects of it.

There was a recent change in the law which allows the joint interagency
task forces, previously established for counternarcotics use, to be used
in the counterterrorist role. And we're undertaking that at this time.
Now, the question I think that arises from that is the active use of
military forces in interdicting traffic back and forth across the
border. And, again, that comes to the sort of public policy decision
that the border control authority for the United States is not the
United States military but our civilian agencies. We do assist those
civilian agencies by providing them information or, for example, flying
helicopter patrols along the southern border and then passing that
information of what we may observe onto the civilian law enforcement
agency.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And do you anticipate that that is a function which
will also be supplied in connection to counterterrorism?

MR. VERGA: I think it's one of those questions of it's difficult -- if
you identify somebody who's trying to sneak across the border, you can't
tell why they're trying to sneak across, you just know that they are and
therefore you pass that on to the appropriate authorities. It would be
useful in a counterterrorist role.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Does NORTHCOM have an intelligence capability? Does it
have its own intelligence unit?

MR. VERGA: It has its own intelligence analysis capability, as do all
our Combatant Commands. The J-2 in military jargon is the intelligence
officer for the command, and they take intelligence product and analyze
it based on the particular command's mission. We collect intelligence
only in accordance with the applicable laws, which restrict the
collection of intelligence inside the United States, principally to
counterintelligence in conjunction with the FBI.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: So if I understand you correctly, the Department of
Defense interprets its mission on NORTHCOM with respect to force
protection or any other traditional intelligence component of a command,
such as NORTHCOM if it were outside the United States, to restrict the
military from the collection function.

MR. VERGA: Yeah. From the gathering and collecting of intelligence
inside the United States, that's correct.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And it is, however, a customer of collected
intelligence. Is that correct?

MR. VERGA: That's correct as well.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: In looking at your detailed statement, at page 8 you
list a pretty good shopping list that goes on to page 9 of examples of
technology transfer specific to the areas of border and transportation
security, where the Department of Defense is making a contribution. Do
you anywhere indicate the data-mining project that was initiated at
DARPA or was then brought through this Total Information Awareness which
became Terrorist Information Awareness under Admiral Poindexter?

MR. VERGA: I did not indicate that in my written statement, nor have we
passed that technology on to any other agencies as of this time. There
are two very similar programs, that one which is the opportunity to use
-- I don't like the term data-mining, but data correlation I think is
probably a more appropriate term -- data correlation techniques to do
exactly what the Commissioner talked about doing manually post-9/11 but
doing it in an automated basis. We also have a joint protection
enterprise network which is a DOD network which we use for force
protection purposes, which is the ability to exchange relevant
information among the military commands associated with force protection
inside the United States.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Was there some -- that program that had been initiated
in DARPA, is that continuing?

MR. VERGA: The research on that is continuing as of now.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Okay. And if Northern Command is a customer for
collected intelligence, does that include intelligence about U.S.
citizens?

MR. VERGA: Only to the extent that it's permitted by law for NORTHCOM to
have information about U.S. persons. We conduct all of our intelligence
activities inside the United States or outside the United States in
accordance with the applicable law, and there are --

MR. BEN-VENISTE: I understand.

MR. VERGA: There are restrictions on the types of information that the
Department of Defense can collect or hold on U.S. persons. If it's
relative to the protection of U.S. installations or property, equipment,
a criminal investigation or a counterintelligence investigation, then
military intelligence activities could keep and hold that information,
otherwise they're not permitted to.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Would you agree that the creation of NORTHCOM now
provides a much broader need in the traditional sense for force
protection or other intelligence?

MR. VERGA: I don't think it creates any additional need. What NORTHCOM
and the Northern Command provides is centralized command structure to
undertake military activities that are authorized inside the United
States. They have currently only command and control type forces or
headquarters assigned to them. They receive forces on an as needed
basis, should they be required to come to the assistance of another
federal agency in response to the consequences of a terrorist attack.
But they didn't -- it did not create any additional need just by the
creation of Northern Command. The responsibilities for force protection
remained where they were before with the services, for example, or with
Joint Forces Command, which had the forces prior to the creation of
NORTHCOM.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Thank you very much.

Mr. Hamilton --

MR. HAMILTON: Chair has two more commissioners who want to ask
questions. Commissioner Gorelick and then Commissioner Fielding.

Commissioner Gorelick.

MS. GORELICK: Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman.

Let me start with you, Mr. Verga, kind of follow up on what Mr.
Ben-Veniste's been asking about but from a different angle. We have what
used to be a CINC and now a Combatant Commander for every part of the
world except the United States. And the American public I think would
find it interesting to know that if you have a Combatant Commander for a
particular area of the world, that person probes the intelligence to see
what the threats are, does scenario planning against those threats,
trains, makes sure that troops are trained against those missions,
exercises against those missions and against those threats.

You have given what I expect is a very accurate description of what we
have by contrast inside the United States. That is you are in a support
mode to civil authorities basically. You have some border security
functions, consequence management, of course, aerospace warning, but
basically you are in service of civil authorities that have a command
structure that doesn't remotely resemble, as we've heard today and
certainly before this, does not remotely resemble the unitary clear
command responsibility that a CINC or a Combatant Commander has.

Now, in my experience, had we had such a person here in the United
States prior to 9/11, that person would have probed the intelligence,
not necessarily on individual people but on the nature of the threats,
and might have practiced against that scenario and might have, for
example, pre-positioned aircraft in a different manner than they were
indeed pre-positioned. Would you agree with that scenario that I've just
drawn?

MR. VERGA: Let me just address a couple of things. The United States
Northern Command, which was created and became effective on the 1st of
October, 2002, is the command which is responsible for the geographic
area of the world which includes the United States. They have a mission
that's divided into two parts, the protection of the United States'
territory, interests, et cetera from external threats and aggression,
and to support civil authorities as ordered by the President or the
secretary of Defense.

As part of their first mission, they do, in fact, do exactly what you
said, analyze intelligence, look at threats, look at the positioning of
defense forces to deal with those external threats and aggression. The
difference is that the -- let's take the 9/11 attack, for example. The
prevention of the hijacking of the aircraft is, in fact, not the job of
the Department of Defense, it's the job of now the Department of
Homeland Security or the Transportation Security Administration.

Dealing with those hijacked aircraft after they had become weapons aimed
at the United States would in fact be the mission of the Department of
Defense and we position our defense forces accordingly. At the time, our
defense forces were positioned in accordance with the perceived air
threat against the United States, which was external threats to the
United States, so therefore we were looking outward, not inward, not
looking at external threats that manifest themselves internally, if
that's not an inconsistent statement.

Currently, every single day United States Northern Command looks at the
available intelligence and then arrays the air defense forces in
accordance with their estimation of where the most probable need might
arise. But we still look to the civilian agencies to prevent the
hijacking of aircraft. The obvious last thing that you want to have to
do is to shoot down a civilian aircraft that had been hijacked. So
therefore we would expect that no civilian airliner would be allowed to
take off if there were a doubt that would require us to be better
positioned to shoot that aircraft down.

MS. GORELICK: All right. So just to be clear, let's talk about the pre
and post-9/11 environment. Post-9/11, is the commander of NORTHCOM,
Northern Command, operating as a functional equivalent of the Combatant
Commanders elsewhere in the world in terms of responsibility for
assessing the threat, ensuring that scenario planning is done against
those threats, ensuring that troops, et cetera, are trained for missions
that would meet those threats.

MR. VERGA: That's correct. Consistent with their mission statement and
also consistent with the fact while he's a geographic Combatant
Commander like any other, the area of operation is, in fact, unique
because it contains the government of the United States, 54 sovereign
states and territories to deal with, so it's not exactly the same as
being an overseas Combatant Commander, but in terms of the mission to
defend the United States and respond to consequence management
requirements, he does all those things that you said.

MS. GORELICK: Prior to 9/11, was there any person who had that
functional equivalent role to assess the intelligence with regard to the
threats against the United States that might occur domestically and to
address those scenarios by scenario planning, training, pre-positioning
of all the means of defense? Was there any single person who had that
role prior to 9/11?

MR. VERGA: No single one. The responsibility for defense was actually
divided in two parts. Air defense was the responsibility of North
American Aerospace Defense Command and land and maritime defense was the
responsibility of Joint Forces Command, which was headquartered down at
Norfolk, Virginia.

MS. GORELICK: And did they have the same analogue response? In other
words, for the person who had responsibility for our air defenses on
that day, was that person charged with understand the full panoply of
threats to our nation's security from the air, addressing scenarios that
might arise as suggested by that intelligence, and pre-positioning both
individuals that were appropriately trained and equipment to meet those
threats.

MR. VERGA: I would have to answer yes to that question. I would also
have to qualify that yes by saying that the emphasis of the defense
activities of the United States at that particular time were external. I
don't think there was anybody who was, again, concentrating on an
external threat manifesting itself internally to the extent I believe
your question implies.

MS. GORELICK: Thank you for that very straightforward answer.

Mr. Bonner, a question for you. We have heard that there were 33
hijacker entries and two referrals to Customs' secondary inspection. And
I'd like to address one of them, which was Waleed al Shehri, who as I
understand it, he was -- there was a secondary inspection report that
states that a secondary inspection was complete and he was not permitted
entry into the Bahamas and returned to Florida by Bahamian immigration.
So my question to you is could it be that someone who would be rejected
by the Bahamian authorities would be accepted by us, and if so, under
what circumstances and what would we do about it?

MR. BONNER: Well, first of all, I know nothing whatsoever of any report
you might have with respect to a secondary inspection on al Shehri. So
there may have been one and it may have been INS, it may have been
Customs. I have no idea, not seen the report, so it gets very
speculative. I don't even know how to begin to answer that. But if he
were a non-immigrant who was not otherwise entitled to enter the United
States, obviously one would hope that he would not have been permitted
to enter the country. I have no idea -- if, in fact, I have to assume
your hypothetical because I do not have any knowledge of the fact --

MS. GORELICK: Well, maybe we'll do rather than --

MR. BONNER: -- that he was turned down by the Bahamian government, I
mean, the question would be why was he refused entry there? Was it
because he required a visa and didn't have one? Did he have a proper
visa to enter the U.S.? I mean, there are two many facts that I just
don't have at my command to answer that question.

MS. GORELICK: I should not have -- I'm sorry. I should not have presumed
your familiarity with this, and what I will do is ask the staff to
review with you what I'm referring to and maybe you can give me your
comments for the record.

MR. BONNER: I'd be happy to provide a response to you.

MS. GORELICK: Mr. Ziglar, I was struck in reading your testimony about
how thematically similar it was to Doris Meissner's testimony with
regard to the development of policy in the immigration area and the
political environment in which the INS has had to function. You refer
very strikingly to funding inadequacies, to the failure of Congress to
respond to your restructuring plan, which was a modification or a
carrying forward in some respects of Commissioner Meissner's
restructuring plan. You've told the story about what happened to you
when you tried to make a seemingly modest proposal with regard to the
visa period.

And the two elements of what you say and what Commissioner Meissner said
are really the same. One is that we need as a country to have a much
more balanced and thoughtful approach to immigration. But, in fact, what
we have is policy development characterized by a highly politicized
environment, an agency buffeted by both inconsistent knee-jerk pendulum
swings of points of view and inadequate funding. Now, you've been a
student of the INS and certainly Doris Meissner has been for decades.
Would that be a fair characterization of your view of the way in which
we view immigration policy and the consequences that that might have for
the security of our nation?

MR. ZIGLAR: I think that's a good characterization of it. I've had the
opportunity since I left the Commission to be a fellow up at the Kennedy
School, thinking and talking about this issue, then teaching at George
Washington Law School in the area. And I've had the good fortune for the
last year really to be able to study the history in very great detail.
What we're experiencing and what we've experienced in the last decade or
two decades in immigration is not new. Our schizophrenia or ambivalence
or whatever word you want to have about it goes back really literally
back to the late 1700s and we have periods throughout our history where
this has been through.

The one thing that struck me in my study of the history of immigration
is that the one policy area that the executive and the judicial branches
give the most deference to is immigration. I can't think of, based on my
study, any other place where the Congress has literally more control of
a policy area, from the funding to the execution, through the means that
Congress can do. And so, given an issue like immigration which divides
the country and has divided it so many times, it's not surprising to me
that we have been going back and forth and that, you know, you get some
laws but nobody wants to fund it. Everybody gets a little something and,
as a result of it, what we end up with is a system that doesn't work and
sometimes can't be enforced or even if it could be enforced, we don't
have the resources to do it.

MS. GORELICK: So I take it's your view then is that with this high level
of deference to the Congress and the highly politicized nature of
immigration in our body politic that the result is an agency less
competent, less able to proceed fairly and perhaps less able to protect
us. Would that be your view?

MR. ZIGLAR: I would take the word "competent" or "incompetent" out of
that. Sure, we had incompetent people. We have incompetent people in the
private sector. We have incompetent people in other agencies. I worked
up here in the Senate for many years. We even had some incompetent
people up here. But the fact is that the folks at the INS are
overwhelmed and there is a certain fact that when you are overwhelmed
that just kind of paralyses things at times. So that's the way I would
characterize it.

MS. GORELICK: I wasn't casting aspersions at all on the tens of
thousands of very able men and women who have worked in the immigration
area over the years. I mean, it was my -- one of my pleasures to
supervise the agency for a period of time when I was at the Department
of Justice. But I was referring to the difficulty of acting competently
when you have shifting requirements, inadequate funding and fear of
retribution when you try your job.

Thank you very much for your comments.

MR. ZIGLAR: Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Commissioner Fielding, we are going to make short questions
and succinct answers because we are running a little late on time.

MR. FIELDING: Mr. Chairman, I'll solve this problem. Thank you all,
first of all, for appearing and also for your past and present years of
wonderful government service and your service to this commission.

Mr. Bonner, I have a line of questioning about the targeting rule that
you discussed earlier in regard to identifying terrorism threats in
container ships. With your indulgence, I'd like to discuss that to the
staff and we'll complete it that way, if that's --

MR. BONNER: That will be fine, Mr. Fielding.

MR. FIELDING: Thank you.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. KEAN: Thank you.

Senator Kerrey.

MR. KERREY: You yielded some time to me, I hope.

Secretary Verga, let me -- earlier in a conversation with Commissioner
Meissner and Secretary Ryan, I made what I think is an accurate point
which is that a very significant fraction of our response to terrorism
in all its forms is connected to our concern about Islamist terrorism.
Do you share that view? We keep using the word "terrorism" as if there
is like six different flavors and seven different varieties and so
forth. It seems to me that we're talking about, in terms of what gets us
all worked up and seriously frightened, is a singular brand of
terrorism.

MR. VERGA: I think that's a fair statement. Most of the terrorist
organizations with global reach could be characterized as Islamic
fundamental terrorists. That's a fair statement.

MR. KERREY: I'm trying to think of terrorist organizations as a global
reach. It's not.

MR. VERGA: Global reach, I'd have to think about. But I would agree with
that. I can't think of one right off --

MR. KERREY: One of the presumptions that I keep hearing -- and all three
of you are post-9/11 appointees, so you're off the hook. You can look
back on this with a little more relief and objectivity, I hope. But
because it seems to me that one of the presumptions that keep surfacing
for those of us -- and I was in the Senate prior to 9/11 and a lot of
that work that we did, it seems to me, was inadequate to assess the
possibility that the homeland was going to be attacked. A lot of the
presumptions were that simply wasn't a possibility.

And we heard Secretary Ryan say, she said to me we were focused on a
potential attack overseas and yet the evidence over the past 10 years
seems to suggest that that wasn't a good presumption, beginning with the
World Trade Center action and following on with the attack on the CIA
and even the attack on Khobar Towers was against Americans. Unclear
exactly at the time who was responsible for what. But certainly the
global reach and the possibility that the United States of America could
be attacked should have been a front and center concern of everybody
that was evaluating that threat.

MR. VERGA: I think that that's fair but I think that the evaluation of
the type of attack or scope and scale led to the conclusion or to the
view that prevention of that type of activity is primarily law
enforcement activity. Since we're talking about internal security
matters of the United States, we have throughout our history made those
matters of civilian concern and not military concern. And so we, in the
Department of Defense, would look to the elimination of terrorist
activities overseas as our way of doing that, in military terminology,
defense in depth. You know, that's why we pursue the global war on
terrorism, Iraq, Afghanistan, other locations and turn to the civilian
law enforcement agencies to deal with activities inside the United
States.

MR. KERREY: That's actually a second opinion beyond just the DOD's
responsibilities on the matter. I mean, even though it was an
international event, we sent the FBI over to investigate Khobar. We sent
the FBI over to investigate Dar es Salaam and Nairobi. We sent the FBI
to investigate the Cole as if it was a law enforcement case.

MR. VERGA: We have throughout history dealt with acts of terrorism as
violations of U.S. law. It is, you know, a sort of legalistic burden of
proof kind of idea that we had gotten ourselves into prior to 9/11 or,
even in some cases, post-9/11, when you talk about specific acts of
terrorism because I think that's the nature of our society is to turn to
legal remedies short of war.

MR. KERREY: But the two moments that I think caused us to -- should have
caused us to analyze this threat much differently. The first was the
East African embassy bombings on the 7th of August that necessitated a
significant amount of sophistication. Earlier I made the point that, if
you look at the details of what these 19 men did on 11th September, they
defeated every defense that we had in place, every single on of them.
And there is no other word that you can put on it other than they
defeated us.

They defeated the INS. They defeated the Department of State. They
defeated the FAA. They defeated the airlines. Every single turn, they
defeated and in part, the defense seems to be, gee, we thought they were
going to hit us over the Middle East and it seems to me that both there
and take the Bojinka plot, which is the other one that I was going to
reference, we have the airlines and the FAA in here tomorrow to talk to
them. It seems to me reasonable -- and I seek your educated opinion on
this, not necessarily your DOD opinion.

But it seems to me that, at the very least, we should have been prepared
for a multiple hijacking event and we were not prepared for a multiple
hijacking event. Once again, we said, Well, gee, we didn't think that
was going to happen. At some point, you run out of patience when people
say, I didn't think that was going to happen when we were defeated so
clearly in areas where we shouldn't have been defeated.

MR. VERGA: I can't disagree that they defeated any defenses that we had
in place and that those defenses were, by evidence, inadequate. I think
what we have to do is to look at what we're doing today, look at what
we're doing in the future in order to learn from that mistake and not
let it happen again.

MR. KERREY: Would you -- I mean, you've got combat experience -- you put
a perimeter out and a guy falls asleep at nine and says, well, we
haven't been attacked for months and months and months. Why should we
worry about it any longer? That's not an excuse you would accept if you
went out and found that somebody out on the perimeter that's providing
security asleep. And yet that's the defense. There hadn't been a
hijacking in 10 years. Thus we really didn't have to worry about it any
longer. Am I thinking in a way that would be consistent with the way you
would evaluate this?

MR. VERGA: Clearly we should have and clearly we didn't, but, you know,
retrospectively that's an easy conclusion to come to. I think based on
the information people had available at the time, they came to a
different conclusion. And I would not be in a position -- I was not in a
position to make those judgments myself and would hesitate to second
guess someone. You make a judgment based on the best information you
have available at the time based on your experience and the information
that's brought to you. Sometimes you come to the right conclusion and
sometimes you come to the wrong conclusion.

MR. KERREY: But it seems to me that -- I appreciate hesitating to second
guess, but if I put somebody in charge of security and if I put someone
in charge of INS and say keep us safe, if I put somebody in charge of
the Consular Office, if I put somebody in charge of the FAA and the
airlines and say, 'whoops, I was looking someplace else.' I mean, I can
be sympathetic all I want to but at some point I need to say hey, you're
responsible for this and it doesn't work any longer to say 'well, you
didn't give me the intelligence, I was sitting there waiting for it. I
didn't realize.' I mean, that's what Secretary Lehman was saying
earlier. Everybody knew after Dar Es Salaam in Nairobi that we were up
against an extremely sophisticated operation, that the old stuff we were
using after World Trade Center I, which was these guys aren't very
sophisticated, thank God we've got people out there that are trying to
get the deposit back on the Ryder truck, all the stuff, the disparaging
evaluations that were being done at the time, it was clear that that was
no longer going to work.

I'm going to ask Mr. Bonner just one -- I'm going to take you off the
hook here. I'm going to ask Commissioner Bonner. Earlier we had -- and I
promise, Mr. Chairman, I'm going to be brief on this. Earlier we had a
presentation -- it went by very quickly -- of documents that these
conspirators, these hijackers used. It was put out there, the staff are
making a case and I think a very effective case that the idea that the
-- they just all came in legally and they're all clean and nothing could
have been done about it, that's a false idea. That there was
manipulation of documents and there was also some mistakes that were
made on our side and one of them had to do with Mohamed Atta and I'm
going to try on my own to stick this thing in so you can see it.

Can you see that from where you're sitting?

MR. BONNER: I can see it pretty well.

MR. KERREY: You can sit where you are Well, maybe you have to come over
and look at it. What you have here is a visa and then a secondary
evaluation that was done and the question is whether -- I mean,
basically what happened here, in the case of Mohamed Atta you've got
somebody says I'm coming to the United States under one kind of a visa
while the secondary evaluation clearly identified that that's not true.
That he's in a flight school, that he's applying for a change of status.
And the question is whether or not the -- I don't know what you call
them any longer, the single faced person that's INS and Customs --

MR. BONNER: Customs and Border Protection officers or inspectors.

MR. KERREY: Do they still have the discretion to make this kind of
judgment?

MR. BONNER: Yeah, they do but the discretion is pursuant to guidance
that I've issued, and that is that if there is a -- after a questioning
of a person -- we have a right to question everybody that's coming into
the United States. And after questioning if there's a concern about that
person for a terrorist threat and there is a basis, and there is almost
always a basis for a non-immigrant, that person is excluded from the
U.S. That's what Inspector Melendez did, by the way. He did his job
right. Yes, of course we could do this, and of course Mohamed Atta
should have been excluded from the United States. But it's the beauty of
hindsight and that sort of thing. I don't want to be -- actually this
was handled by INS inspectors at the time.

Commissioner Ziglar has just alluded to the kind of pressures that were
put on the INS from Congress and others to just let people in. But those
days are over. I'll tell you that right now. We've issued the directions
that you've got somebody coming in and he did -- he was not entitled to
come in because he was coming in -- he was changing his status, he had
left the United States, he was not entitled to come back in the United
States. And I'm saying that if there was a concern in anybody's mind in
the Immigration secondary --

MR. KERREY: I'm very impressed with the confidence that you're using
here, but Khalid Shaikh Mohammed used an alias and got in. You're saying
that that can't be done today?

MR. BONNER: I think it's a lot more difficult to get -- if you're
talking about using --

MR. KERREY: Wait a minute, if I could use your own words. You said, "a
lot more difficult." That's a lot different than the absolute certainty
that you were using --

MR. BONNER: There is no foolproof system. I'm just saying, look, of
course we should after -- first of all, I would say you would ask some
questions of Mohamed Atta. We obviously -- you know, this is in
hindsight, this is after 9/11, but we have instituted as part of CBP's
procedures that somebody that is by the way identified as potential,
could be a potential threat to the United States is going to go to get
some questions. Very often that's going to be in secondary. If you have
some concerns about them and they can be excluded from the United
States, that should be done. In this instance he was not entitled, by
the way, to enter the U.S.

MR. KERREY: Tell me what does this phrase "with hindsight" mean? What is
that all about? I mean, if you've put me in charge of something and I
make a mistake can I come and say, "Oh, sure, with hindsight you're
going to come in here and tell me I did something wrong"?

MR. BONNER: I'm not excusing or condoning anything, Senator, I want you
to understand that. I'm just saying, you know, there is some hindsight
that's applied here and we ought to learn from it and we ought to
improve what we do, and we have. And I'd be happy to tell you how we've
done it.

MR. KERREY: The narrative that concerns me a bit, Mr. Commissioner,
which has nothing to do with you or any of you three gentlemen, it has
to do with at moments in time -- the watershed for me was 7 August '78
-- at moments in time when we should have known that we were at
considerable risk to Islamic extremists, we didn't -- you didn't get a
presidential directive driving it down. At the moment in time that the
Cole was clearly -- sometime early in '01 the information came and said
we're absolutely certain the Cole attack was done by al Qaeda, Islamic
extremist terrorism. I know it may not be politically correct but that's
where it comes from. Yet you earlier, in response to Commissioner
Ben-Veniste's questioning you said -- I find this remarkable -- I mean,
you said we can figure out who the 19 were in 45 minutes. I mean, that's
a shocking thing to hear because it basically says that there were
simple ways to have prevented this from happening and we didn't do it.

MR. BONNER: And knowing too -- I mean, that's a very important fact that
we knew two of them --

MR. KERREY: All right, so what's it take? I run the manifest against a
lookout and the planes don't take off.

MR. BONNER: Absolutely. Well, and so the question would be are you doing
that? You bet. Now, if you wanted me to comment on something that was
done, look, it was wrong. First of all this was -- even under the INS
regulations at the time, Atta was not admissible into the United States
because he had left the country and he was seeking to change status.
Once you leave the country you're not entitled to come back in. So he
shouldn't have been let back in -- and let me just stop there. He
shouldn't have been let in.

MR. KERREY: Have you been on Crossfire before because you're very good
at this -- (laughter) --

MR. BONNER: Not Crossfire but similar - -

MR. KERREY: But you did say -- in front of 12 men and women in a jury,
is that what it is? Did you say though and answer in the affirmative
that INS agents have the discretion today to when there's a
contradiction in status such as this ---

MR. BONNER: No, in that situation, no, there is no discretion because
this was not -- this person could not be admitted because he was out of
status. What I'm saying is in the area -- really, what I should have
clarified is in the area where there is discretion to parole somebody in
or admit somebody in, that the guidance to the field -- and this is all
of the legacy Immigration inspectors, legacy Customs inspectors, the
guidance is that essentially if there is any concern about somebody
posing a potential terrorist threat you exercise discretion to exclude
that person from the United States. So I'm not saying there's discretion
in this case because I believe that still -- the law and regulation is
that if you're out of status you cannot be admitted back in.

Senator, I don't want to overstate things either. I actually almost want
to go back and see what the discretion would be in this situation, that
is to say where somebody was out of status because I believe that there
ought to be some discretion here. I don't think we mindlessly apply laws
and regulations. So that if this person that was out of status and had
applied for a change status, I don't know -- you know, it's the
proverbial 68-year-old grandmother who doesn't fit any targeting
criteria for a terrorist and we're satisfied that person isn't a
terrorist. I don't want to mindlessly exercise some rule that just
doesn't make any sense.

What we're trying to do is to have it clear to all the men and women on
the front line what we're trying to do here, and that is our job, as I
stated in my testimony, our priority mission our priority mission is
preventing terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United
States. So our job is to use our questioning skills -- those skills that
Inspector Melendez has back here -- to use those skills and make a
determination and then, if you're concerned about somebody you're darn
right to exclude them from the country by expedited removal. And that's
what we do.

So frankly, with respect to would we in a hundred percent of the cases
in all circumstances not exercise any discretion here, I actually don't
know. I don't know the answer to that. I'll get you the answer. But I
believe we ought to have some discretion, I just think it ought to be
guided in a principled way toward essentially the priority mission of
homeland security, and that's keeping terrorists out.

MR. LEHMAN: But shouldn't there also be some accountability as well? I
mean, following up on the Senator's theme. I mean, the only person
that's been disciplined since 9/11 has been John Poindexter.

(Applause.)

MR. LEHMAN: Now, I --

MR. BONNER: I think Mary Ryan. She was here this morning. I don't know
how you characterize that, but I won't characterize it.

MR. LEHMAN: Yes. She left, not because she screwed up but because she
spoke out and said that she didn't get any intelligence, as I understand
it.

MR. BONNER: There ought to be accountability and that is that you do --
I mean, in all circumstances we ought to make responsibility and
accountability as clear as we possibly can. And so another thing -- you
know, we have essentially a system where if you're going to admit
somebody in where you've done this interview, that has to be recorded. A
supervisor does have to take a look at it and say that makes sense. But
it's in accordance with not just the pure question of whether somebody's
admissible into the United States which was, to some extent, going back
to Doris Meissner and long before that -- I've been around government
for 30 years. That was the central question INS was asking. That's an
important question. But the more important question clearly now is: Is
this person seeking admission to our country a potential terrorist? And
using the combined Immigration and Customs authority to make that
determination, as astutely as possible and, if there is a concern, make
sure that person does not get into our country.

MR. LEHMAN: Just out of curiosity, is Officer Melendez today making any
more money or is he a higher rank than the 19 of his colleagues that let
in the terrorists?

(Applause.)

MR. BONNER: Well, he certainly deserves an award and commendation, but
to answer your question, I don't know. I'm sure Inspector Melendez will
check with me a little bit later on this one.

MR. KERREY: I hope so.

MR. KEAN: Commissioner Roemer.

MR. ROEMER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. KEAN: We are very late on time, sir.

MR. ROEMER: I realize that. I'll try to be very brief. I did want to
follow up on one of the Senator's points with respect to, with all due
respect, it's not so much hindsight looking back for us as it is one of
really the celebrated successes at the Millennium of Customs and INS and
Border Patrol working together to stop something from happening. Senator
Kerrey mentioned the turning point being Africa in 1998 and the bombings
there.

Well, certainly in the Millennium we have terrorists targeting our
domestic homeland and more specifically the Los Angeles airport. Ressam
is trying to get across the border, up on the northwest border, and you
have a celebrated success at the Millennium. You have something that has
been widely reported in the media when an agent who is doing her job
very diligently and with some serendipity, discovers what she seems to
think might be some drug problems and, with some combined skills from
some other people, they look in the trunk and find bomb material and we
catch somebody that might be coming at us to bomb the LA airport.

Now, we're not talking about specifically airlines as we were in the
Bojinka plot, we are talking about a domestic threat that happened in
1993 at the World Trade Center which they came to, it happened outside
Langley where there was a shooting, it happened in the Landmarks case in
New York where terrorists wanted to bomb some of our most historic sites
up in New York City. Why? It's not hindsight. Why is it, why is it that
we aren't more focused from outside inward to the domestic threat?

MR. BONNER: Well, we definitely are more focused now. I mean, the
question is why weren't we more focused on 9/11 --

MR. ROEMER: I'm talking about why on September 11th -- why aren't we
more focused?

MR. BONNER: And look, I'm very aware of, as you know, very much aware.
There's a Customs inspector, Diana Dean who was questioning Ahmed
Ressam. Ahmed Ressam was not only an Algerian national in Canada
illegally but he had gone to terrorist training camp, camps run by al
Qaeda in Afghanistan. He was to link up with some al Qaeda terrorists in
the United States to assist them to carry out the bombing attack on Los
Angeles International Airport.

So, yeah, it's one inspector -- cold hit by the way -- just like
Inspector Melendez. Cold hit by Inspector Dean. No advance information,
just doing her job. So it is important, by the way, to have well trained
people doing their job. We obviously want to be able to give them more
information in terms of who it is they need to look at, what they need
to look at, to improve our chances of preventing terrorists from
entering our country to carry out attacks.

So I don't -- by the way, when I said hindsight I don't mean that
pejoratively. The 9/11 Commission is doing exactly what it should be
doing: looking at this and trying to figure out what we could have done
better and what we need to do better and what we are doing better. So I
don't mean to -- please don't interpret that as critical whatsoever.

MR. ROEMER: Senator Kerrey's gone, you can say anything you want about
him now -- (laughter) --

MR. BONNER: Would you tell Senator Kerrey --

MR. ROEMER: We'll see. We'll see how you continue to answer these
questions. On the training side, you've said that these agents did their
job without advance knowledge on the border to get Ressam. Great example
of fortune and training and skill and some education and combination of
resources coming together to catch this person. But we also need
strategic and tactical information to give them advance warning about
our borders. There are reports that al Qaeda cells still exist in the
United States or up in Canada. Where are you getting, Commissioner, your
strategic and tactical intelligence now? Apparently it's not from the
CIA.

MR. BONNER: Well, every day actually, before March 1 of 2003, every day
or virtually every working day I did get an intelligence briefing in the
morning by the CIA.

MR. ROEMER: Up until when?

MR. BONNER: Up until the formation of the Department of Homeland
Security.

MR. ROEMER: So in March?

MR. BONNER: Yes, on March 1 of this year. And now I am getting
intelligence information. We have an Office of Intelligence within
Customs -- now Customs and Border Protection -- so we get all of the
classified cables come into our SKIF and they are reviewed by our people
in terms of one question: is this going to be helpful to the frontline
inspectors at the borders to have this information. Now, by the way, if
--

MR. ROEMER: Let me just ask a quick question. Are these new or newly
hired people or are they, as I've experienced with debriefings from the
CIA, you have some of the most experienced people at CIA with the
decades of experience. You don't have those briefings any more as of
March 1. Do you have the new- hired and the inexperienced people giving
you these briefs now?

MR. BONNER: That was just me personally getting briefings. Which is
important, by the way.

MR. ROEMER: No, no, I'm just curious as to how we're formulating the
people that are coming to give us the tactical intelligence.

MR. BONNER: This is a small cadre of intelligence analysts that we had
at U.S. Customs. It's smaller now because there was a break-off of
Customs, but it's a small cadre of intelligence analysts that have the
highest level of clearances, including SCI clearances and they are
looking at -- this is just one of the mechanisms.

MR. ROEMER: Yes, but this is a new department. Where are they from? Are
they detailed from another agency?

MR. BONNER: No, these are people -- the people that are looking at the
classified cables are U.S. Customs and Border Protection intelligence
analysts as part of our Office of Intelligence. It's not the only source
where we get information. I just want you to know there are about 800
classified cables a day. We look at them -- does it have any
information, not just tactically but strategically important to the
border and border security. Now, if it does, as I think you know, under
the rules, we have to go back, as we do, to the originating source to
declassify that so we can put out an appropriate alert or information to
the field, and that's what we do. That's why we have that note there.

We are also getting information from the Information Analysis
Infrastructure -- can't say it -- IAIP -- Information Analysis
Infrastructure Protection Directorate of the Department of Homeland
Security which is drawing -- and we put our collection requirements up
to -- I'm going to call it IA -- and it puts them to the intel community
and we are actually pulling valuable information down that is relevant
and related to border security through IAIP as a unit within the new
Department of Homeland Security. You've already heard testimony today on
the TTIC which is now stood up, I believe, and also the Terrorist
Screening Center which is to actually develop one master terrorist
watchlist for our government and the like.

So it's not that we're just getting it from one place. And I still, by
the way, I do get a weekly briefing typically from the CIA and I also
get another briefing once or twice a week from our own Office of
Intelligence myself, just to make sure that we understand as best we can
everything that's relevant and that we are then tasking operationally
intelligence driven special operations to all the ports of entry in the
United States, all the legacy Customs and Immigration inspectors who are
now CBP officers, and to the border patrol.

MR. ROEMER: What we just continue to be very worried about is that we
have these great experienced people out at CIA and new people, new
hires, less experienced people coming in to new slots and new
requirements at TTIC and Department of Homeland Security and that will
be a task-up problem and a training problem and is something that I'm
sure, Commissioner Bonner, you're experiencing. The day has been very
long. We've had a great series of panels and you've been very helpful.

Let me conclude with just one last question to Mr. Ziglar. According to
our staff -- and let me just read you a couple of sentences. Here's what
might happen at our borders, port of entry today. "Today at ports of
entry, inspectors swipe machine readable passports when they are
presented. The computer then prompts the inspector to enter the visa
type. The computer tells the inspector to give the B-1, B-2 applicant
six months." Six months to stay. The hijacker, Waleed al Shehri, for
instance, only requested 20 days but was given automatically by the
computer six months. Do you think that there should be an automatic
designated length of stay for people coming into this country when
they're requesting significantly less than that and why aren't we
addressing this?

MR. ZIGLAR: Congressman, I actually addressed that in my opening
statement. In fact, I propose that we have a 30-day default period when
there was ambiguity about how long somebody wanted to stay and that we
operate on the basis of you come in, you say I'm going to be here for
two weeks and here's my itinerary, and we give you two weeks or we give
you three weeks or we give you some reasonable period of time, as
opposed to just by default giving you six months. My view was that six
months, number one, encourages overstays. They get here, they like it,
they find a boyfriend or girlfriend -- all these things happen.

Secondly, it certainly gives a lot of time for evil folks to come in
here and do their thing really undetected. And so I thought -- my view
was that if we're going to have an entry-exit system that will record
the comings and goings and we have this 30 day default period, or we
know why you're here and how long you're going to be here, that we can
match those things up a whole lot better and -- not just for terrorism
though, Congressman, for better control of our borders and better
enforcement of our immigration laws, because not everybody who comes
across the border is a terrorist, but there are people that come across
the border with the intent of staying here because they like it. And one
of the biggest problems we've got are illegal aliens in the country.
Forty percent of those are overstays. And it seems to me that we can
deal with that problem by not having such a wide open default period of
six months. That was my view. We published a notice of proposed
regulations and, boy, did the storm start.

MR. ROEMER: Mr. Ziglar, I actually -- it's been a long day but not so
long that I didn't listen to your very eloquent opening statement. I
heard you say that, that you proposed it. Congress hasn't listened and
haven't done anything about that. How can we make your proposal
effective?

MR. ZIGLAR: Congressman, Congress doesn't have to do anything about
that.

MR. ROEMER: So how do we get it by the Executive Branch or by permission
of somebody -- how do we accomplish what you sought out to try to
achieve?

MR. ZIGLAR: They've got to convince the Executive Branch to do it and
then you've got to convince the Executive Branch not to bend when
Congress threatens them with the ability to cut off money or to do all
the things that Congress can do to the Executive Branch. This does not
require legislation. This is a regulation function.

MR. LEHMAN: Are you talking about Mr. Executive Branch Bonner?

MR. BONNER: I just made a note -- (laughter) --

MR. ROEMER: You've got the right people here today to do something about
that if they'd listen to that kind of proposal.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. KEAN: Our last question comes from Commissioner Ben-Veniste.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Mr. Verga, you appear to want to say something and I
want to say something to you so maybe it's possible we're on the same
wavelength. In response to a question posed by Commissioner Gorelick and
then additional questions by Senator Kerrey, you indicated that with
respect to NORAD, pre-9/11 your focus was on the external threat: you
were facing the wrong direction to be helpful with respect to the
suicide hijackings of 9/11. But, so that the record is accurate, it is
not to say that NORAD did not train for the possibility and practice
exercises for the possibility of multiple hijackings within the United
States territory, isn't that so?

MR. VERGA: That's correct.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: And even going back to the Atlanta Olympics, the
protection of the airspace over the Olympics, while the military was not
allowed to get involved, that was a considerable issue and something
which was given considerable attention by other agencies of the
government. But from time to time over the years, it is correct, is it
not, that NORAD recognized the potentiality for a domestic hijacking
that could threaten the continental United States?

MR. VERGA: It is. I can't say with what frequency or how often. I just
don't have personal knowledge of how often they did that but I'm aware
they did.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Well, that will be a subject of future hearings.

MR. VERGA: What I was going to request, sir, is you asked me a question
about the Total Information Awareness program, now known as Terrorist
Information Awareness, I'd like to submit you a little bit more for the
record. It's a little complicated. There was a period of time when the
program was suspended by Congress. That suspension expired in September
of last year and we're starting it again. So I'll just give you a little
sheet, if that's okay, for the record.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: I'd like to get that and I'd like to, if you wouldn't
mind submitting something in writing with respect to allowing us to
better understand the intelligence gathering function of the NORAD
command.

MR. VERGA: Will do.

MR. BEN-VENISTE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

MR. KEAN: Thank you all very much, and I want to thank this panel.
You've been interesting, enlightening and helpful to our investigation.
Thank you all very, very much. Commissioner Hamilton and I, the Vice
Chairman and I have brief statement to make, at this point we'll adjourn
the hearing.

We've learned a lot today. I think we've significantly advanced our
understandings of the events of 9/11. We've learned, among other things,
that the disruption of terrorist travel needs to be a vital part of our
counterterrorism strategy. It seems before 9/11 that just wasn't
central. So work on terrorist travel documents languished and older
methods for training people to spot them were not sustained. So the visa
system operated without adequate input from national security agencies
and terrorism was not a major priority in our immigration policy or
enforcement efforts.

We also learned that the problems with watchlisting and tracking
potential terrorists go well beyond working level failures. As that
staff statement pointed out, these problems raise issues about
responsibility in the senior management of the intelligence community.
Some of the tragic results in the 9/11 story were detailed today. We're
concerned about whether the management of transnational intelligence has
adapted adequately to the war on terror that exists right now.

In the past the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Consular
Service at the Department of State were not full partners in the war on
terrorism. Clearly they didn't have enough resources to perform their
mission. They did not apply those resources sufficiently against the
counterterrorism priority.

We learned that there was an apparent lack of urgency with respect to
counterterrorism. Senior officials performed their duties with
dedication to the best of their ability, but the world looked very
different to them at the time than it does to us now.

MR. HAMILTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The system of course is different
now, yet you could hear in the commissioners' questions throughout the
morning and the afternoon that we are still concerned about whether old
problems in sharing information are being solved or just replaced by new
ones. For example, the Terrorist Threat Integration Center only
coordinates analysis not operations. Then we heard the Terrorist Threat
Integration Center does not sift the information from domestic agencies
like the FBI, just information from international sources. So the
domestic/foreign divide takes on a new form.

In other words, 9/11 is in the past but the questions revealed by our
analysis of the past remain relevant today. We as a government have a
profound tendency to fight the last war. After the embassy bombings, we
improved embassy security. After Khobar Towers and USS Cole we improved
force protection. We knew a threat was coming in the summer of 2001, but
we thought the threat was abroad, not at home. We have a highly reactive
system in response to specific incidents rather than anticipation.

We heard today from a highly dedicated professional who performed his
duty with great professionalism who prevented a terrible catastrophe
from becoming worse. But we need our systems in place that will enable
the many dedicated professionals in the United States government to
maximize their ability to make America safer and more secure.

Thank you.

MR. KEAN: Thank you very much, sir.

We are now adjourned until 9:00 o'clock tomorrow morning.

Thank you all very, very much.
