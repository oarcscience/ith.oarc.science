### SOME OF THE "FAMOUS" WITCH TRIALS IN PENNSYLVANIA

Early Witch Trial in Pennsylvania.--To illustrate the extremely
fortunate circumstances in having so few witch trials in Pennsylvania,
we bring to you reference to the first reported case (which turned out
to be not much of a case at all), in which William Penn sat in
judgment--and let it speak for itself.

There is in our "'Pow Wow' Book," (The Aurand Press, Harrisburg, 1929),
a detailed account of what appears to be the only "witch" trial in the
entire history of the Colony, Province or the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania.

Margaret Mattson and Yeshro Hendrickson, (Swedish women), had been
accused as witches, and the jury accordingly found a true bill. Absentee
jurymen were fined 40 shillings each!

The first mentioned pleaded "not guilty" to the charge that she
bewitched calves, geese, etc., but that, while she could bewitch cattle,
oxen were above her reach. Her daughter's suspicions and convictions
were given in evidence, but "the prisoner denieth all things."

Governor Penn charged the jury, which brought in a verdict sufficiently
ambigious and ineffective for such a dubious offense, saying they find
her "guilty of having the common fame of a witch, but not guilty in the
manner and form as she stands indicted." The women were put on their
good behavior for six months!

It may be pointed out that in the early days of the colony, we had by
precedent, a statute of King James I. "That act," says Watson in his
"Annals of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania," "was held to be part of our
law by an act of our provincial Assembly, entitled 'An Act against
conjuration, witchcraft and dealing with evil and wicked spirits.'"

But all around us in the early days one heard of witches and
witchcraft--Virginia, New Jersey, New York, and New England. Where, even
today, is there a State, or Nation, wherein one cannot find such
beliefs? Folklore and customs are long-lasting; because we have never
learned of such things is a poor assumption that there is no "such
thing."

The Penn decision reminds one of the account of Jesus in the Temple,
writing on the ground with his finger, and saying, as we read in John
8:7: ". . . He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone
at her . . . 9. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own
conscience, went out one by one. . ."

Several "Near" Witch Trials.--The case of the York boys, three of them,
who murdered an old man for a book, or a lock of hair, back in 1928, is
well known throughout America. It was about that time that newspapers
needed some innoculations in the matter of a new line of news, and the
York case certainly went a long way to fill the bill.

Subsequently a baby at Lebanon died of malnutrition, and again the
"witch doctor" got it in the neck, and the newspapers got the "news."

In the same neighborhood a "buried treasure" hoax got abroad, and
"headlines" got a lot of "hex" ideas across.

A case in Lehigh county tried to rear its head a dozen years ago, but if
it was a "witch" case they are still trying to solve it.

Then there was the Bechtel case in Philadelphia--a Mennonite who was
murdered--the authorities at first declaring it was witchcraft--which it
wasn't.

Murder "For Insurance" Is Hardly "Witchcraft."--Recently closing its
records, the Philadelphia courts charged a number of persons with
"witchcraft," or, at least that was the impression left after reading
the newspapers. The cases turned out to be nothing more than mere
"murder-for-insurance"--surely a long way off from "witchcraft."

The Shinsky Case in 1934.--There was the case of Albert Shinsky, near
Pottsville--notable for the fact that he claimed he killed a witch in
self -defense--and, that nothing whatsoever happened in that affair to
prove, or disprove, the theory regarding witches, other than that they
are creatures of the mind, and of that fact there is little, or no
doubt.

Newspapers at that time published a copyright account by this writer,
some of them with screaming headlines: "Did Bible Figure in Witch
Slaying?"

In the article thus published, we had not established positively that
the Bible did figure, but suggested "it could have;" this conclusion was
supported a few days later when a professor from a Philadelphia
university, accompanied by an officer, called on Shinsky in his jail
cell.

Warden William Watson, of the Schuylkill county prison, reported that
Albert Shinsky believed that the murder of Mrs. Mummey, a "witch," was
justified in the Bible. Warden Watson was quoted in the Phila.
"Inquirer," of March 26, 1934, as follows:

"He told me," said the Warden, "that there are numerous instances in the
Scriptures where the sacrifice of human life has been declared
necessary. He cited the Old Testament tale of how Abraham was about to
kill his son Isaac on the altar as showing the necessity for taking
human life to placate spiritual curses or spells.

"He told me that all the New Testament writers clearly believed in the
power of demons and that the devil is a real personage, and not merely
an evil influence as modern theologists have it.

"The Bible represents the devil as a fallen angel, who goes about
whispering and suggesting evil acts. If you will read closely you will
find that Hell was made for the torment of the devil, and not human
beings, as a way of escape from that place has been provided for all of
us."

An eminent psychiatrist, Dr. A. I. Baron, of Philadelphia, who examined
Shinsky in jail, reports that

"When I left his cell after an exhaustive research as far back as his
earliest memories, I knew that I had been talking to an adolescent boy
of the most primitive development. I had been talking with a mental and
emotional infant.

"If the State demands the death penalty for Schuylkill county's 'hex'
slayer, society will be seeking revenge upon a 13-year-old savage."

Dr. Barton reported that Shinsky, although 23 years old, "has actually
been five different people, each personally at war with the other four;"
that he was "in medical phraseology--an emotional, imaginative extrovert
with schizophrenic reactions."

If psychiatrists were called in to examine 100, or 1000 adults, taken
from the streets at random, we wonder how many of that number would have
large traces of the same "disease" attributed to Shinsky. Surely the
"things" he bred in his mind can be found in the minds of all too many
others.

It is probably true, as pointed out elsewhere in this account, that
"religion and superstition walk hand in hand;" that children learn about
"this and that," but cannot, when they reach adulthood, separate their
thoughts from those learned as a child. The general effects of this
inability to forget surely has taken a terrible toll in the history of
man.

Yet, on the other hand, if we could forget as easily as would be
necessary to get rid of witches, we would as likely forget to whom we
are married, whose kids belong to who, and certainly where we live!

Whether Mrs. Mummey was a witch, or not, we'll never know--and the
authorities sent Albert to a place for men with "weak minds."

The Late Clarence Darrow, Esq., Was Interested in the York "Witch" Case

The late Clarence G. Darrow, eminent lawyer and scholar, is quoted in
reference to the York witchcraft case, at the sentencing of 14-year-old
John Curry, to "life in prison."

"Outrage," is the one word expressed by Darrow, who then queried: "Do
you think the State of Pennsylvania will stand for it? . . . It seems a
terrible outrage." Yes, the State did stand for it, although, after
something like ten years Curry was released from the penitentiary.

While many persons did not like all of Darrow's opinions, nevertheless
he was a deep thinker, and we record here his opinions regarding the
York case, as reported in the Harrisburg "Patriot," Feb. 21, 1929:

"Belief in witchcraft cannot, in itself, be thought a crime. If it is
there would be but few of us really innocent. Not so many years ago our
best people and devout Christians not only believed in witches but
guaranteed their celestial happiness by murdering them.

"We placidly admit that there are sections of our country where people
are isolated by their own customs and thought, or by geography, and live
quaintly a century and a half behind our little more enlightened
communities. But we forget that a mere century and a half takes us
almost back to Cotton Mather and the stake. Then witches were hanged for
the glory of God and for the peace of mind of those who thought they had
been or might be bewitched. There are today groups of people who have
advanced but little in mentality beyond the ignorant frenzy that
glorified in hangings.

"Even today a literal interpretation of the Bible would force us to
believe in witchcraft and sorcery. And those simple folk of which that
Curry boy is a product hold strictly to the Word just as they find it.
To them the Witch of Endor is very real. The devil is real. Spells are
real. In their world, furnished by traditions, myths and Old World lore,
handed down unchanged from one generation to another, there are evil
spirits as certain as a flying railroad train bearing down on a motorist
stalled on the tracks.

"Is there any doubt that Curry and those others believed that Rehmeyer
had an evil power which he could exercise at will? Is there any doubt
that they thought a lock of his hair would break the spell? Nothing new
in that belief, nothing unusual. Reach into your own pocket for your own
personal protector against bad luck.

"Our belief in capital punishment as a deterrent is just another form of
witchcraft. Apart from the mass desire for revenge, there is a
subconscious desire to rid ourselves of what we believe to be an evil
person. We look in vain for any proof that executions have had any
effect on crime. When England punished by death everything from bread
and sheep stealing to wholesale killing, crime was far more general than
it is today. Education and the training of youth in trades and
profession has diminished crime, never the death penalty.

"Isn't there every reason to believe that the crime of murder is a
symptom. In the York case it was clearly a symptom of a prevailing
ignorance, a condition which should never be allowed to exist in the
State of Pennsylvania. . . ."
