### WITCHCRAFT AND BELIEFS IN EVIL SPIRITS CAME TO AMERICA LONG AGO

Witches Active in Middle Ages.--In the middle ages in Europe there was
great activity in "witchcraft." Then came a time when the Popes took
cognizance of the practices to which the layman of the church, and
outsiders, were resorting--certain functions generally reserved for the
priesthood.

Following Papal Bulls in 1233 and 1484, thousands upon thousands of
innocent people were put to death, as they are in Europe today--because
they happened to live at the time some "master" of misguided religious
or political philosophy cared little whether the people "would be better
off dead, than alive."

There may be considerable division among people relative to the term
"witch;" some will want to class it with devils, or demons. There may be
other forms which some would want to employ to describe the opposite of
an angel. Now, so far as most of us are concerned, the latter have been
described largely through artists' conceptions, which, as in the case of
devils, leave much in doubt, and to the imagination as well.

Europeans Knew About Witches.--The earliest settlers of
America--Spanish, English, Dutch, Swedes, French, German, etc., all had
a "working knowledge," generally speaking, of religious backgrounds,
especially respecting good and bad--angels and witches. Most of the
books brought to America by either of the above races were of a
religious nature, having, of course, general rules for religious
behavior, if not of a moral and civil behavior, as well.

Today, as in the earliest colonial days, it matters little whether one
gets his religious knowledge in the public schools, or parochial
schools; in the home, or directly from religious publications.

The knowledge available to all, even to the unlearned, or unschooled, is
so widespread as to convey certain religious philosophies to the layman.

He doesn't have to know the law of God, nor of man, to understand that
the normal laws of society forbid that he should kill his fellow man.
Some are thus held in restraint, but when a man wants to kill--he'll do
it!

But one of the sins of society is that so many men (and women) of sound
mental knowledge and able to reason, are killers, and who escape the
just punishment for their crime. "Extenuating circumstances;" "passion;"
"mentally unsound;" and "drunkenness!" We would like to use a remark
attributed to the late President Lincoln, which propriety forbids our
using here; it isn't often that his language may be too expressive--even
if only about "horses."

Bible Basis for Strong Beliefs.--If a christian anywhere, particularly a
protestant christian, wishes to know the fundamental law on "behavior"
he sooner or later goes to the Scriptures for "light." Surely the reader
will not question our ethics in bringing this phase of the subject to
any one's attention.

Rev. P. Marion Simms, Ph. D., in his very enlightening and comprehensive
account of "The Bible in America," says:

The Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Church differ in many
things, but nowhere more widely than the place they assign the Bible,
and in the right of its private interpretation . . . By this means they
(the former) think to avoid the dangers involved . . .

The old time conception, once held well-nigh universally among
Christians, that the Bible is the very Word of God, verbally dictated by
the Lord hiniself and infallible in its every statement, has been
responsible for more misuse of the Bible than all other influences put
together . . .

Therefore, with entire consistency, "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to
live," (Exodus 22:18) was made the basis of the persecution of witches,
with all its horrors. This Scripture was the chief authority for the
execution of witches everywhere; and it is only a modified conception of
the Bible that can release the church from the obligation of witch
hunting today. Changing the translation to "sorceress" does not affect
the authority of the commandment . . . The stories of the persecution of
witches and that of the Inquisition could be written only with a pen
dipped in blood and tears and yet it came legitimately from the old time
conception and interpretation of the Bible. All persecutions by
Christians in America, as elsewhere, were supported always by quotations
from the Bible.

And so, because it is true that the vast majority of the early settlers
of America were men who read the Bible, and imparted its truths and
lessons of all kinds to their children, and no less to their
grandchildren, we have today in America, the hodge-podge which was
Europe. The various races have handed to each succeeding generation
their pet notions in everything.

Do we know any Irish who are not "in love" with old Irish traditions;
Slav with Slavish; Norse with Norse; Latin with Latin? You can answer
this from your own observations. The Anglo-Saxon is proud of notions and
ideals he can recall; so is the Jew; and so is the Negro. Traditions are
hard to change, or forget.

Today we are reaping, as each generation does, that portion of knowledge
which was sown early in the dawn of history, and as it ripens and falls
into the minds of young and old everywhere, we shall accordingly stand
or fall by our decisions to be rational, or irrational--"orthodox," or
"unorthodox."
