SWALLOW-WORT.

A means to overcome and end all fighting and anger, and to cause a sick
man to weep when his health is restored, or to sing with a cheerful
voice when on his death bed; also a very good remedy for dim eyes or
shining of the eyes. This weed grows at the time when the swallows build
their nests or eagles breed. If a man carries this' about him, together
with the heart of a mole, he shall overcome all fighting and anger. If
these things . are put upon the head of a sick man, he shall weep at the
restoration of his health, and sing with a cheerful voice when he comes
to die. When the swallow-wort blooms, the flowers must be pounded up and
boiled, and then the water must be poured off into another vessel, and
again be placed to the fire and carefully skimmed; then it must be
filtered through a cloth and preserved, and whosoever has dim eyes or
shining eyes, may bathe his eyes with it, and they will become clear and
sound.
