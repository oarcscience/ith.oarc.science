A WELL-TRIED CHARM.

Three holy drops of blood have passed down the holy cheeks of the Lord
God, and these three holy drops of blood are placed before the
touchhole. As surely as our dear lady was pure from all men, as surely
shall no fire or smoke pass out of this barrel. Barrel, do thou give
neither fire, nor flame, nor heat. Now I will walk out, because the Lord
God goeth before me; God the Son is with me, and God the Holy Ghost is
about me forever.

ANOTHER WELL-TRIED CHARM AGAINST FIRE-ARMS.

Blessed is the hour in which Jesus Christ was born; blessed is the hour
in which Jesus Christ was born; blessed is the hour in which Jesus
Christ was born;

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

blessed is the hour in which Jesus Christ has arisen from the dead;
blessed are these three hours over thy gun, that no shot or ball shall
fly toward me, and neither my skin, nor my hair, nor my blood, nor my
flesh be injured by them, and that no kind of weapon or metal shall do
me any harm, so surely as the Mother of God shall not bring forth
another son. + + +. Amen.

A CHARM TO GAIN ADVANTAGE OF A MAN OF SUPERIOR STRENGTH.

I \[*name*\] breathe upon thee. Three drops of blood I take from thee:
the first out of thy heart, the other out of thy liver, and the third
out of thy vital powers; and in this I deprive thee of thy strength and
manliness.

Hbbi Massa danti Lantien. I. I. I.
