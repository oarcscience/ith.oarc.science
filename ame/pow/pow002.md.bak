# TESTIMONIALS

Which go to show at any time, that I, Hohman, have successfully applied
the prescriptions of this book.

BENJAMIN STOUDT, the Son of a Lutheran schoolmaster, at Reading,
suffered dreadfully from a wheal in the eye. In a little more than 24
hours this eye was as sound as the other one, by the aid I rendered him
with the help of God, in the year 1817.

HENRY JORGER, residing in Reading, brought to me a boy who suffered
extreme pain, caused by a wheal in the eye, in the year 1814. In a
little more than 24 hours, I, with the help of God, have healed him.

JOHN BAYER, son of Jacob Bayer, now living near Reading, had an ulcer on
his leg, which gave him great pain. I attended him, and in a short time
the leg was well. This was in the year 1818.

LANDLIN GOTTWALD, formerly residing in Reading, had a severe pain in his
one arm. In about 24 hours I cured his arm.

CATHARINE MECK, at that time in Alsace township, suffered very much from
a wheal in the. eye. In a little more than 24 hours the eye was healed.

MR. SILVIS, of Reading, came to my house while engaged at the brewery of
my neighbor. He felt great pain in the eye caused by a wheal. I cured
his eye in a little more than 24 hours.

ANNA SNYDER, of Alsace township, had a severe pain in one of her
fingers. In a little more than twenty-four hours she felt relieved.

MICHAEL HARTMAN, Jr., living in Alsace township, had a child with a very
sore mouth. I attended it and

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

in a little more than twenty-four hours it was well again.

JOHN BINGEMANN, at Ruscombmanor, Berks county, had a boy who burnt
himself dreadfully. My wife came to that place in the fall of the year
1812. Mortification. had already set in--my wife had sympathy for it,
and in a short time the mortification was banished. The boy was soon
after perfectly cured and became well again. It was about the same time
that my wife cured John Bingemann's wife of the wild-fire, which she had
on a sore leg.

SUSANNA GOMBER had a severe pain in the head. In a short time I relieved
her.

The wife of David Brecht also felt a severe pain in the head, and was
relieved by me in a short time.

JOHN JUNKINS' daughter and daughter-in-law both suffered very much from
pain in the head; and his wife too had a sore check, on which the
wild-fire had broken out severely. The headache of the daughter and the
daughter-in-law- was banished by me; and the wild-fire, of the wife was
cured in some seven or nine hours. The swelled cheek burst open and
healed very fast. The woman had been laid up several days already on
account of it. The family of Junkins live at Nackenmixen, but Brecht and
Gomber reside in and near Reading. Nackenmixen is in Bucks county. The
four last mentioned were cured in the year 1819.

The daughter of John Arnold scalded herself with boiling coffee; the
handle of the pot broke off while she was pouring out coffee, and the
coffee ran over the arm and burnt it severely. I was present and
witnessed the accident. I banished the burning; the arm did not get sore
at all, and healed in a short time. This was in the year 1815. Mr.
Arnold lived near Lebanon, Lebanon county, Penn.

JACOB STOUFFER, at Heckak, Bucks county, had a

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

little child who was subject to convulsions every hour. I sold him a
book containing the 25 letters; and he was persuaded by his neighbor,
Henry Frankenfield, to try these 25 letters. The result was that the
child was instantaneously free from convulsions and perfectly well.
These letters are also to be found in this book.

<span id="img_finger"></span> ![](img/finger.jpg)If any one of the above
named witnesses, who have been cured by me and my wife through the help
of God, dares to call me a liar, and deny having been relieved by us,
although they have confessed that the) have been cured by us, I shall,
if it is at all possible, compel them to repeat their confession before
a Justice of the Peace.

A letter to cure rheumatism, sold at from one to two dollars, and, did
not even give directions how to make use of it: these depending on
verbal communications. John Allgaier, of Reading, had a very sore
finger. I used sympathy to banish the wild-fire and to cure the finger.
The very next morning the wild-fire was gone; he scarcely felt any pain,
and the finger began to heal very fast. This was in 1819.

<span id="img_finger"></span> ![](img/finger.jpg)This book is partly
derived from a work published by a Gypsy, and partly from secret
writings, and collected with much pain and trouble, from all parts of
the world, at different periods, by the author, John George Hohman. I
did not wish to publish it; my wife, also, was opposed to its
publication; but my compassion for my suffering fellow-men was too
strong, for I had seen many a one lose his entire sight by a wheal, and
his life or limb by mortification. And how dreadfully has many a woman
suffered from mother-fits? And I therefore ask thee again, oh friend,
male or female, is it not to my everlasting praise, that I have had such
books printed? Do I not deserve the rewards of God for it? Where else is
the physician that could cure these diseases? Besides that I am a poor
man in needy circumstances,

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

and it is a help to me if I can make a little money with the sale of my
books.

The Lord bless the beginning and the end of this little work, and be
with us, that we may not misuse it, and thus commit a heavy sin! The
word misuse, means as much as to use it for anything unnecessary. God
bless us! Amen. The word Amen means as much as that the Lord might bring
to pass in reality what had. been asked for in prayer.

HOHMAN.               

NOTE.

There are many in America who believe neither in a hell nor in a heaven;
but in Germany there are not so many of these persons found. I, Hohman,
ask: Who can immediately banish the wheal, or mortification? I reply,
and I, Hohman, say: All this is done by the Lord. Therefore, a hell and
a heaven must exist; and I think very little of any one who dares deny
it.
