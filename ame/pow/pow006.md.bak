*Pow-Wows, or Long Lost Friend*, by John George Hoffman, \[1820\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A remedy to be used when anyone is falling away, and which has cured
many persons.--Let the person in perfect soberness and without having
conversed with anyone, catch rain in a pot, before sunrise; boil on egg
in this; bore three small holes in this egg with a needle, and carry it
to an ant-hill made by big ants; and that person will feel relieved as
soon as the egg is devoured.
