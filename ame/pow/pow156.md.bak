Whoever is born upon one of these days is unfortunate and suffers much
poverty; and whoever takes sick on one of these days seldom recovers
health; and those who engage or marry on these days become very poor and
miserable. Neither is it advisable to move from one house to another,
nor to travel, nor to bargain, nor to engage in a lawsuit, on one of
these days.

The Signs of the Zodiac must be observed by the

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

course of the moon, as they are daily given in common almanacs.

If a cow calves in the sign of the Virgin, the calf will not live one
year; if it happens in the Scorpion, it will die much sooner; therefore
no one should be weaned off in these signs, nor in the sign of the
Capricorn or Aquarius, and they will be in less danger from mortal
inflammation.

This is the only piece extracted from a centennial almanac imported from
Germany, and there are many who believe in it. HOHMAN.
