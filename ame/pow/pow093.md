CURE FOR THE TOOTHACHE.

Hohman, the author of this book, has cured the severest toothache more
than sixty times, with this remedy.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

and, out of the sixty times he applied it, it failed but once in
affecting a cure. Take blue vitriol and put a piece of it in the hollow
tooth, yet not too much; spit out the water that collects in the mouth,
and be careful to swallow none. I do not know whether it is good for
teeth that are not hollow, but I should judge it would cure any kind of
toothache.
