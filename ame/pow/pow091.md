*Pow-Wows, or Long Lost Friend*, by John George Hoffman, \[1820\], at

VERY GOOD CURE FOR WEAKNESS OF THE LIMBS, FOR THE PURIFICATION OF THE
BLOOD, FOR THE INVIGORATION OF THE HEAD AND HEART, AND TO REMOVE
GIDDINESS, ETC.

Take two drops of oil of cloves in a tablespoonful of white wine early
in the morning, and before eating anything else. This is also good for
the mother-pains and the colic. The oil of cloves which you buy in the
drug stores will answer the purpose. These remedies are also applicable
to cure the cold when it settles in the bowels, and to stop vomiting. A
few drops of this oil poured upon cotton and applied to the aching
teeth, relieves the pain.
