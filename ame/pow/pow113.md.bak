*Pow-Wows, or Long Lost Friend*, by John George Hoffman, \[1820\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO PREVENT WITCHES FROM BEWITCHING CATTLE, TO BE WRITTEN AND PLACED IN
THE STABLE; AND AGAINST BAD MEN AND EVIL SPIRITS WHICH NIGHTLY TORMENT
OLD AND YOUNG PEOPLE, TO BE WRITTEN AND PLACED ON THE BEDSTEAD.

"Trotter Head, I forbid thee my house and premises; I forbid thee my
horse and cow-stable; I forbid thee my bedstead, that thou mayest not
breathe upon me; breathe into some other house, until thou hast ascended
every hill, until thou hast counted every fence-post, and until thou
hast crossed every water. And thus dear day may come again into my
house, in the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
Amen."

This will certainly protect and free all persons and animals from
witchcraft.
