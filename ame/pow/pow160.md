PEACHES.

The flowers of the peach-tree, prepared like salad, opens the bowels,
and is of use in the dropsy. Six or seven peeled kernels of the
peach-stone, eaten daily, will ease the gravel; they are also said to
prevent drunkenness, when eaten before meals.

Whoever loses his hair should pound up peach kernels; mix them with
vinegar, and put them on the bald place.

The water distilled from peach flowers opens the bowels of infants and
destroys their worms.
