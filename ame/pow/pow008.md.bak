*Pow-Wows, or Long Lost Friend*, by John George Hoffman, \[1820\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

A good Remedy for Worms, to be used for men as well as for Cattle:

Mary, God's Mother, traversed the land,  
Holding three worms close in her hand;  
One was white, the other was black, the third was red.

This must be repeated three times, at the same time stroking the person
or animal with the hand; and at the end of each application strike the
back of the person or the animal, to wit: at the first application once,
at the second application twice, and at the third application three
times; and then set the worms a certain time, but not less than three
minutes.
