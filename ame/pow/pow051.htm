<p align="CENTER">HELIOTROPE (SUN-FLOWER) A MEANS TO PREVENT CALUMNIATION.</p> 
<p>The virtues of this plant are miraculous. If it be collected in the sign of the lion, in the month of August, and wrapped up in a laurel leaf together with the tooth of a wolf. Whoever carries this about him, will never be addressed harshly by anyone, but all will speak to him kindly and peaceably. And if anything has been stolen from you put this under your head during the night, and you will surely see the whole figure of the thief. This has been found true.</p>
