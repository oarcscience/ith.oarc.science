TO COMPEL A THIEF TO RETURN STOLEN GOODS.

Walk out early in the morning before sunrise, to a juniper-tree, and
bend it with the left hand toward the rising sun, while you are saying:
Juniper-tree, I shall bend and squeeze thee, until the thief has
returned the stolen goods to the place from which he took them. Then you
must take a stone and put it on the bush, and under the bush and the
stone you must place the skull of a malefactor. + + + Yet you must be
careful, in case the thief returns the stolen goods, to unloose the bush
and replace the stone where it was before.
