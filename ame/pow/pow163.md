REMEDY FOR THE LOCK JAW.

We are informed by a friend that a sure preventive against this terrible
disease, is, to take some soft soap and mix it with a sufficient
quantity of pulverized chalk, so as to make it of the consistency of
buckwheat batter; keep the chalk moistened with a fresh supply of soap
until the wound begins to discharge, and the patient finds relief. Our
friend stated to us that explicit confidence may be placed in what he
says, that he has known several cases where this remedy has been
successfully applied. So simple and valuable a remedy, within the reach
of everyone, ought to be generally known.--
