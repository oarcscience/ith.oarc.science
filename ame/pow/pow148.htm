<p align="CENTER">A VERY EFFECTIVE CHARM.</p> 
<p>I (<i>name</i>) conjure thee, sword or knife, as well as all other weapons, by that spear which pierced Jesus' side, and opened it to the gushing out of blood and water, that he keep me from injury as one of the servants of God. + + + Amen.</p> 
<p align="CENTER">A VERY SAFE AND RELIABLE CHARM.</p> 
<p>The peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with me [<i>name</i>]. Oh shot, stand still! in the name of the mighty prophets Agtion and Elias, and do not kill me! oh shot, stop short. I conjure you by heaven and earth, and by the last judgment, that you do no harm unto me, a child of God. + + +</p> 
<p align="CENTER">A GOOD CHARM AGAINST THIEVES.</p> 
<p>There are three lilies standing upon the grave of the Lord our God; the first one is the courage of God, the other is the blood of God, and the third one is the will of God. Stand still, thief! No more than Jesus Christ stepped down from the cross, no more shalt thou move from this spot; this I command thee by the four evangelists and elements of heaven, there in the river, or in the shot, or in the judgment, or in the sight. Thus I conjure you by the last judgment to stand still and not to move, until I see all the stars in heaven and the sun rises again. Thus I stop by running and jumping and command it in the name of + + +. Amen.</p> 
<p>This must be repeated three times.</p>
