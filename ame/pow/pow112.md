TO PREVENT CONFLAGRATION.

Take a black chicken, in the morning or evening, cut its head off and
throw it upon the ground; cut its stomach out, yet leave it altogether;
then try to get a piece of a shirt which was worn by a chaste virgin
during her terms, and cut out a piece as large as a common dish from
that part which is bloodiest. These two things wrap up together, then
try to get an egg which was laid on maunday Thursday. These three things
put together in wax; then put them in a pot holding eight quarts, and
bury it under the threshold of your house, with the aid of God, and as
long as there remains a single stick of your house together, no
conflagration will happen. If your house should happen to be on fire
already in front and behind, the fire will nevertheless do no injury to
you nor to your children. This is done by the power of God, and is quite
certain and infallible. <span id="page_40">p. 40</span> If fire should
break out unexpectedly, then try to get a whole shirt in which your
servant-maid had her terms or a sheet on which a child was born, and
throw it into the fire, wrapped up in a bundle, and without saying
anything. This will certainly stop it.
