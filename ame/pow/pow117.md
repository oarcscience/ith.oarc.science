HOW TO FASTEN OR SPELL-BIND ANYTHING.

You say, "Christ's cross and Christ's crown, Christ Jesus' colored
blood, be thou every hour good. God, the Father, is before me; God, the
Son, is beside me; God, the Holy Ghost, is behind me. Whoever now is
stronger than these three persons may come, by day or night, to attack
me." + + +

Then say the Lord's prayer three times.

ANOTHER WAY OF FASTENING OR SPELL-BINDING.

After repeating the above, You speak, "At every step may Jesus walk with
(*name*). He is my head; I am his limb; therefore, Jesus, be with
(*name*)."
