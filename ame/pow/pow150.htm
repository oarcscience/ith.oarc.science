<p align="CENTER">A WELL-TRIED CHARM.</p> 
<p>Three holy drops of blood have passed down the holy cheeks of the Lord God, and these three holy drops of blood are placed before the touchhole. As surely as our dear lady was pure from all men, as surely shall no fire or smoke pass out of this barrel. Barrel, do thou give neither fire, nor flame, nor heat. Now I will walk out, because the Lord God goeth before me; God the Son is with me, and God the Holy Ghost is about me forever.</p> 
<p align="CENTER">ANOTHER WELL-TRIED CHARM AGAINST FIRE-ARMS.</p> 
<p>Blessed is the hour in which Jesus Christ was born; blessed is the hour in which Jesus Christ was born; blessed is the hour in which Jesus Christ was born;</p> 
<p><a name="page_59"><font size="1" color="green">p. 59</font></A></p> 
<p>blessed is the hour in which Jesus Christ has arisen from the dead; blessed are these three hours over thy gun, that no shot or ball shall fly toward me, and neither my skin, nor my hair, nor my blood, nor my flesh be injured by them, and that no kind of weapon or metal shall do me any harm, so surely as the Mother of God shall not bring forth another son. + + +. Amen.</p> 
<p align="CENTER">A CHARM TO GAIN ADVANTAGE OF A MAN OF SUPERIOR STRENGTH.</p> 
<p>I [<i>name</i>] breathe upon thee. Three drops of blood I take from thee: the first out of thy heart, the other out of thy liver, and the third out of thy vital powers; and in this I deprive thee of thy strength and manliness.</p> <b>
