A VERY GOOD AND CERTAIN MEANS OF DESTROYING THE WHEAL IN THE EYE.

Take a dirty plate; if you have none, you can easily dirty one, and the
person for whom you are using sympathy shall in a few minutes find the
pain much relieved. You must hold that side of the plate or dish, which
is used in eating, toward the eye. While you hold the plate before the
eye, you must say:

Dirty plate, I press thee,  
Wheal in the eye, do flee.
