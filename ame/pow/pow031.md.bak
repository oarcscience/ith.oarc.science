*Pow-Wows, or Long Lost Friend*, by John George Hoffman, \[1820\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

A VERY GOOD REMEDY FOR THE COLIC.

Take half a gill of good rye whiskey, and a pipe full of tobacco; put
the whiskey in a bottle, then smoke the tobacco and blow the smoke into
the bottle, shake it well and drink it. This has cured the author of
this book and many others. Or, take a white clay pipe which has turned
blackish from smoking, pound it to a fine powder, and take it. This will
have the same effect.
