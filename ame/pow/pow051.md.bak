HELIOTROPE (SUN-FLOWER) A MEANS TO PREVENT CALUMNIATION.

The virtues of this plant are miraculous. If it be collected in the sign
of the lion, in the month of August, and wrapped up in a laurel leaf
together with the tooth of a wolf. Whoever carries this about him, will
never be addressed harshly by anyone, but all will speak to him kindly
and peaceably. And if anything has been stolen from you put this under
your head during the night, and you will surely see the whole figure of
the thief. This has been found true.
