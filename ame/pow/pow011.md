A GOOD REMEDY FOR THE FEVER.

Good morning, dear Thursday! Take away from \[*name*\] the 77-fold
fevers. Oh! thou dear Lord Jesus Christ, take them away from him! + + +

This must be used on Thursday for the first time, on

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

Friday for the second time, and on Saturday for the third time; and each
time thrice.. The prayer of faith has also to be said each time, and not
a word dare be spoken to anyone until the sun has risen. Neither dare
the sick per, son speak to anyone till after sunrise; nor eat pork, nor
drink milk, nor cross a running water, for nine days.
