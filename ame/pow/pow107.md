A GOOD WAY TO DESTROY WORMS IN BEE-HIVES.

With very little trouble and at an expense of a quarter dollar, you can
certainly free your bee-hives from worms for a whole year. Get from an
apothecary store the powder called Pensses Blum, which will not injure
the bees in the least. The application of it is as follows: <span
id="page_37">p. 37</span> For one bee-hive you take as much of this
powder as the point of your knife will hold, mix it with one ounce of
good whiskey, and put it in a common vial; then make a hole in the
bee-hive and pour it in thus mixed with the whiskey, which is sufficient
for one hive at once. Make the hole so that it can be easily poured in.
As said before, a quarter dollar's worth of this powder is enough for
one hive.
