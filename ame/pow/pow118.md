A BENEDICTION TO PREVENT FIRE.

"The bitter sorrows and the death of our dear Lord Jesus Christ shall
prevail. Fire and wind and great heat and all that is within the power
of these elements, I command thee, through the Lord Jesus Christ, who
has spoken to the winds and the waters, and they obeyed him. By these
powerful words spoken by Jesus, I command, threaten, and inform thee,
fire, flame, and heat, and your powers as elements, to flee forthwith,
The holy, rosy blood of our dear Lord Jesus Christ may rule it. Thou,
fire, and wind, and great beat, I command

thee, as the Lord did, by his holy angels, command the great heat in the
fiery oven to leave those three holy men, Shadrach and his companions,
Meshach and Abednego, untouched, which was done accordingly. Thus thou
shalt abate, thou fire, flame, and great heat, the Almighty God having
spoken in creating. the four elements, together with heaven and earth;
Fiat! Fiat! Fiat! that is: It shall be in the name of God the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
