*Pow-Wows, or Long Lost Friend*, by John George Hoffman, \[1820\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO ATTACH A DOG TO A PERSON, PROVIDED NOTHING ELSE WAS USED BEFORE TO
EFFECT IT.

Try to draw some of your blood, and let the dog eat it along with his
food, and he will stay with you. Or scrape the four corners of your
table while you are eating, and continue to eat with the same knife
after having scraped the corners of the table. Let the dog eat those
scrapings, and he will stay with you.
