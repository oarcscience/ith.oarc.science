HOW TO MAKE CATTLE RETURN TO THE SAME PLACE.

Pull. out three small bunches of hair, one between the horns, one from
the middle of the back, and one near the tail, and make your cattle eat
it in their feed.

ANOTHER METHOD OF MAKING CATTLE RETURN HOME.

Take a handful of salt, go upon your fields and make your cattle walk
three times around the same stump or stone, each time
[keeping](errata.htm#0) the same direction; that is to say, you must
three times arrive at the same end of the stump or stone at which you
started from, and then let your cattle lick the salt from the stump or
stone.
