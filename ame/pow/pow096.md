*Pow-Wows, or Long Lost Friend*, by John George Hoffman, \[1820\], at

A VERY GOOD MEANS TO INCREASE THE GROWTH OF WOOL OR SHEEP, AND TO
PREVENT DISEASE AMONG THEM.

William. Ellis, in his excellent work on the manner of raising sheep,
relates the following: a tenant who had a flock of sheep that produced
an unusual quantity of wool. He informed me that he was in the habit of
washing his sheep with buttermilk just after shearing them, which was
the cause of the unusual growth of wool; because it in a known fact that
butter does not only improve the growth of sheep's wool, but also of the
hair of other animals. Those who have no buttermilk may substitute
common milk with salt and water, which will answer nearly as well to
wash the sheep just sheared. And I guarantee that by rightly applying
this means, you will not only have a great increase of wool, but the
sheep-lice and their entire brood will be destroyed. It also cures an
manner of scab and itch, and prevents them from taking cold.
