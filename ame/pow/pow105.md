AN EASY METHOD OF CATCHING FISH.

In a vessel of white glass must be put: 8 grains of civit, (musk), and
as much castorium; two ounces of eel-fat, and 4 ounces of unsalted
butter; after which the vessel must be well closed, and put in some
place where it will keep moderately warm for nine or ten days, and then
the composition must be well stirred with a stick until it is perfectly
mixed.

APPLICATION.--1. *In using the hooks*.-Worms or insects used for baiting
the hooks must first be moistened with this composition, and then put in
a bladder or box, which may be carried in the pocket.

2\. *In using the net*.--Small balls formed of the soft part of fresh
bread must be dipped in this composition and then by means of thread
fastened inside of the net before throwing it into the water.

3\. *Catching Fish with the hand*.--Besmear your legs or boots with this
composition before entering the water at the place where the fish are
expected, and they will collect in great numbers around you.
