# PREFACE

#### TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS USEFUL BOOK.

THE author would have preferred writing no preface whatever to this
little book, were it not indispensably necessary, in order to meet the
erroneous views some men entertain in regard to works of this character.
The majority, undoubtedly, approve of the publication and sale of such
books, yet some are always found who will persist in denouncing them as
something wrong. This latter class I cannot help but pity, for being so
far led astray; and I earnestly pray everyone who might find it in his
power, to bring them from off their ways of error. It is true, whosoever
taketh the name of JESUS in vain, committeth a great sin. Yet, is it not
expressly written in the fiftieth Psalm, according to Luther's
translation: "Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee,
and thou shalt glorify me." In the Catholic translation, the same
passage is found in the forty-ninth Psalm, reading thus: "Call upon me
in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt
glorify me."

Where is the doctor who has ever cured or banished the panting or
palpitation of the heart, and hide-boundness? Where is the doctor who
ever banished a wheal? Where is the doctor who ever banished the
mother-fits? Where is the doctor that can cure mortification when it
once seizes a member of the body? All these cures, and a great many more
mysterious and wonderful things are contained in this book; and its
author could take an oath at any time upon the fact of

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

his having successfully applied many of the prescriptions contained
herein.

I say: any and every man who knowingly neglects using this book in
saving the eye, or the leg, or any other limb of his fellow-man, is
guilty of the loss of such limb, and thus commits a sin, by which he may
forfeit to himself all hope of salvation. Such men refuse to call upon
the Lord in their trouble, although He especially commands it. If men
were not allowed to use sympathetic words, nor the name of the MOST
HIGH, it certainly would not have been revealed to them; and what is
more, the Lord would not help where they are made use of. God can in no
manner be forced to intercede where it is not his divine pleasure.

Another thing I have to notice here: There are men who will say, if one
has used sympathetic words in vain, the medicines of doctors could not
avail any, because the words did not effect a cure. This is only the
excuse of physicians; because whatever cannot be cured by sympathetic
words, can much less be cured by any doctor's craft or cunning: I could
name at any time that Catholic priest whose horse was cured with mere
words; and I could also give the name of the man who did it. I knew the
priest well; he formerly resided in Westmoreland county. If it was
desired, I could also name a Reformed preacher who cured several persons
of the fever, merely by writing them some tickets for that purpose; and
even the names of those persons I could mention. This preacher formerly
resided in Berks county. If men but use out of this book what they
actually need, they surely commit no sin; yet woe unto those who are
guilty that anyone loses his life in consequence of mortification, or
loses a limb, or the sight of the eye! Woe unto those who misconstrue
there things at the moment of danger, or who follow the ill advice of
any preacher who might teach them not to

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

mind what the Lord says in the fiftieth Psalm. "Call upon me in the day
of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me." Woe unto
those who, in obeying the directions of a preacher, neglect using any
means offered by this book against mortification, or inflammation, or
the wheal. I am willing to follow the preacher in all reasonable things,
yet when I am in danger and he advises me not to use any prescriptions
found in this book, in such a case I shall not obey him. And woe also
unto those who use the name of the Lord in vain and for trifling
purposes.

I have given many proofs of the usefulness of this book, and I could yet
do it at any time. I sell my books publicly, and not secretly, as other
mystical books are sold. I am willing that my books should be seen by
everybody, and I shall not secrete or hide myself from any preacher. I,
Hohman, too, have some knowledge of the Scriptures, and I know when to
pray and call unto the Lord for assistance. The publication of books
(provided they are useful and morally right) is not prohibited in the
United States, as is the case in other countries where kings and despots
hold tyrannical sway over the people. I place myself upon the broad
platform of the liberty of the press and of conscience, in regard to
this useful book, and it shall ever be my most heartfelt desire that all
men might have an opportunity of using it to their good, in the name of
Jesus.

Given at Rosenthal, near Reading, Berks county, Penn., on the 31st day
of July, in the year of our Lord, 1819.

JOHN GEORGE HOHMAN.
