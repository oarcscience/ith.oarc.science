A VERY GOOD REMEDY FOR THE GRAVEL.

The author of this book, John George Hohman, applied this remedy, and

ate every morning seven peach-stones before tasting anything else, which
relieved him very much; but as he had the gravel very bad, he was
obliged to use it constantly. I, Hohman, have used it for several weeks.
