TO COMPEL A THIEF TO RETURN STOLEN GOODS.

Early in the morning before sunrise you must go to a pear tree, and take
with you three nails out of a coffin, or three horse-shoe nails that
were never used, and holding these toward the rising Sun. you must say:

"Oh, thief, I bind you by the first nail, which I drive into thy skull
and. thy brain, to return the goods thou hast stolen to their former
place; thou shalt feel as sick and as anxious to see men, and to see the
place you stole from, as felt the disciple Judas after betraying Jesus.
I bind thee by the other nail, which I drive into your lungs and liver,
to. return the stolen goods to their former place; thou shall feel as
sick and as anxious to see men, and to see the place you have stolen
from, as did Pilate in the fires of hell. The third nail I shall drive
into thy foot, oh thief, in order that thou shalt return the stolen
goods to the very same place from which thou hast stolen them. Oh,
thief, I bind thee and compel thee, by the three holy nails which were
driven through the hands and feet of Jesus Christ, to return the stolen
goods to the very same place from which thou hast stolen them. + + + The
three nails, however, must be greased with the grease from an executed
criminal or other sinful person.
