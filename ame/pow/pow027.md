TO BANISH THE WHOOPING COUGH.

Cut three small bunches of hair from the crown of the head of a child
that has never seen its father; sew this hair up in an unbleached rag
and hang it around the neck of the child having the whooping cough. The
thread with which the rag is sewed must also be unbleached.

ANOTHER REMEDY FOR THE WHOOPING COUGH WHICH HAS CURED THE MAJORITY OF
THOSE WHO HAVE APPLIED IT.

Thrust the child having the whooping cough three times through a
blackberry bush, without speaking or saying anything. The bush, however,
must be grown

fast at the two ends, and the child must be thrust through three times
in the same manner, that is to say, from the same side it was thrust
through in the first place.
