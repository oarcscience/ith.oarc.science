### RELIGIOUS GROUPS WERE NUMEROUS BEFORE THE REVOLUTION

Variety of Faiths.--The religious background and life of the Germans is
varied, to say the least. We have little space to detail them at length,
but separate accounts may be found in libraries for particular readers.

The German Baptists, or Brethren, are a denomination of Christians who
emigrated to this country from Germany between the years 1718 and 1730;
they are commonly called Dunkers; but they have assumed for themselves
the name of "Brethren".

The United Brethren in Christ came into activity in the United Stites
about 1755, differing in name from the Moravians, or Unitas Fratrum, (or
United Brethren’s Church) by adding "in Christ." The former mentioned
denomination enjoys a healthy membership scattered throughout the
country.

The Moravians (Unitas Fratrum), or United Brethren’s Church, dates from
1722, descendants of the Bohemian and Moravian Brethren who were
persecuted in their native country, and who founded a colony under the
patronage of Count Zinzendorf, on an estate of his in Upper Lusatia.
American history is replete with accounts of activities of the Count,
and David Zeisberger, who labored among and learned so much from his
association with Indian tribes. Their establishments in the early days
were primarily, at Bethlehem, Nazareth and Lititz.

The Schwenkfelders take their name from Casper Schwenkfeld von Ossing,
who was born seven years after Martin Luther, with whom he had many
disagreements. This denomination arrived in Philadelphia on September
22, 1734, settling principally in Montgomery, Berks, Bucks and Lehigh
counties.

Ephrata Cloister.--One of the most notable of the early pietist
movements was this Ephrata community, under Conrad Beissel, who was born
in Eberbach, in 1690. He was a baker, as was his father. He came to
America in 1720, becoming a hermit on the Cocalico. Others built cabins
around him and imitated his ascetic life. But any religion that
prohibits race propagation soon eliminates itself.
