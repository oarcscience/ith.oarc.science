### AGNES SURRIAGE

When, in 1742, Sir Henry Frankland, collector of the port of Boston,
went to Marblehead to inquire into the smuggling that was pretty boldly
carried on, he put up at the Fountain Inn. As he entered that hostelry a
barefooted girl, of sixteen, who was scrubbing the floor, looked at him.
The young man was handsome, well dressed, gallant in bearing, while
Agnes Surriage, maid of all work, was of good figure, beautiful face,
and modest demeanor. Sir Henry tossed out a coin, bidding her to buy
shoes with it, and passed to his room. But the image of Agnes rose
constantly before him. He sought her company, found her of ready
intelligence for one unschooled, and shortly after this visit he
obtained the consent of her parents—humble folk—to take this wild flower
to the city and cultivate it.

He gave her such an education as the time and place afforded, dressed
her well, and behaved with kindness toward her, while she repaid this
care with the frank bestowal of her heart. The result was not
foreseen—not intended—but they became as man and wife without having
wedded. Colonial society was scandalized, yet the baronet loved the girl
sincerely and could not be persuaded to part from her. Having occasion
to visit England he took Agnes with him and introduced her as Lady
Frankland, but the nature of their alliance had been made known to his
relatives and they refused to receive her. The thought of a permanent
union with the girl had not yet presented itself to the young man. An
aristocrat could not marry a commoner. A nobleman might destroy the
honor of a girl for amusement, but it was beneath his dignity to make
reparation for the act.

Sir Henry was called to Portugal in 1755, and Agnes went with him. They
arrived inopportunely in one respect, though the sequel showed a
blessing in the accident; for while they were sojourning in Lisbon the
earthquake occurred that laid the city in ruins and killed sixty
thousand people. Sir Henry was in his carriage at the time and was
buried beneath a falling wall, but Agnes, who had hurried from her
lodging at the first alarm, sped through the rocking streets in search
of her lover. She found him at last, and, instead of crying or fainting,
she set to work to drag away the stones and timbers that were piled upon
him. Had she been a delicate creature, her lover's equal in birth, such
as Frankland was used to dance with at the state balls, she could not
have done this, but her days of service at the inn had given her a
strength that received fresh accessions from hope and love. In an hour
she had liberated him, and, carrying him to a place of safety, she
cherished the spark of life until health returned. The nobleman had
received sufficient proof of Agnes's love and courage. He realized, at
last, the superiority of worth to birth. He gave his name, as he had
already given his heart, to her, and their married life was happy.
