### NIX'S MATE

The black, pyramidal beacon, called Nix's Mate, is well known to
yachtsmen, sailors, and excursionists in Boston harbor. It rises above a
shoal,—all that is left of a fair, green island which long ago
disappeared in the sea. In 1636 it had an extent of twelve acres, and on
its highest point was a gallows where pirates were hanged in chains. One
night cries were heard on board of a ship that lay at anchor a little
way off shore, and when the watch put off, to see what might be amiss,
the captain, named Nix, was found murdered in his bed. There was no
direct evidence in the case, and no motive could be assigned for the
deed, unless it was the expectancy of promotion on the part of the mate,
in case of his commander's death.

It was found, however, that this possibility gave significance to
certain acts and sayings of that officer during the voyage, and on
circumstantial evidence so slight as this he was convicted and sentenced
to death. As he was led to execution he swore that he was not guilty, as
he had done before, and from the scaffold he cried aloud, "God, show
that I am innocent. Let this island sink and prove to these people that
I have never stained my hands with human blood." Soon after the
execution of his sentence it was noticed that the surf was going higher
on the shore, that certain rocks were no longer uncovered at low tide,
and in time the island wasted away. The colonists looked with awe on
this manifestation and confessed that God had shown their wrong.
