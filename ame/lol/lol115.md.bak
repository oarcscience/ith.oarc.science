### THE LOSS OF JACOB HURD

Jacob Hurd, stern witch-harrier of Ipswich, can abide nothing out of the
ordinary course of things, whether it be flight on a broomstick or the
wrong adding of figures; so his son gives him trouble, for he is an
imaginative boy, who walks alone, talking to the birds, making rhymes,
picking flowers, and dreaming. That he will never be a farmer, mechanic,
or tradesman is as good as certain, and one day when the child runs in
with a story of a golden horse, with tail and mane of silver, on which
he has ridden over land and sea, climbing mountains and swimming rivers,
he turns pale with fright lest the boy be bewitched; then, as the
awfulness of the invention becomes manifest, he cries, "Thou knowest
thou art lying," and strikes the little fellow.

The boy staggers into his mother's arms, and that night falls into a
fever, in which he raves of his horse and the places he will see, while
Jacob sits by his side, too sore in heart for words, and he never leaves
the cot for food or sleep till the fever is burned out. Just before he
closes his eyes the child looks about him and says that he hears the
horse pawing in the road, and, either for dust or cloud or sun gleam, it
seems for an instant as if the horse were there. The boy gives a cry of
joy, then sinks upon his pillow, lifeless.

Some time after this Jacob sets off one morning, while the stars are
out, to see three witches hanged, but at evening his horse comes flying
up the road, splashed with blood and foam, and the neighbors know from
that of Jacob's death, for he is lying by the wayside with an Indian
arrow in his heart and an axemark on his head. The wife runs to the
door, and, though she shakes with fear at its approach, she sees that in
the sunset glow the horse's sides have a shine like gold, and its mane
and tail are silver white. Now the animal is before the house, but the
woman does not faint or cry at the blood splash on the saddle, for—is it
the dust-cloud that takes that shape?—she sees on its back a boy with a
shining face, who throws a kiss at her,—her Paul. He, little poet, lives
in spirit, and has found happiness.
