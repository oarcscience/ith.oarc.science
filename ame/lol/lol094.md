### A CHESTNUT LOG

There is no doubt that farmer Lovel had read ancient history or he would
not have been so ready in the emergency that befell him one time in the
last century. He had settled among the New Hampshire hills near the site
that is now occupied by the village of Washington and had a real good
time there with bears and Indians. It was when he was splitting rails on
Lovel Mountain—they named it for him afterward—that he found himself
surrounded by six Indians, who told him that he was their prisoner. He
agreed that they had the advantage over him and said that he would go
quietly along if they would allow him to finish the big chestnut log
that he was at work on. As he was a powerful fellow and was armed with
an axe worth any two of their tomahawks, and as he would be pretty sure
to have the life of at least one of them if they tried to drive him
faster than he wanted to go, they consented. He said that he would be
ready all the sooner if they would help him to pull the big log apart,
and they agreed to help him. Driving a wedge into the long split he
asked them to take hold, and when they had done this he knocked out the
wedge with a single blow and the twelve hands were caught tight in the
closing wood. Struggle as the savages might, they could not get free,
and after calmly enjoying the situation for a few minutes he walked
slowly from one to the other and split open the heads of all six. Then
he went to work again splitting up more chestnuts.
