### THE SPIDER TOWER

In Dead Man's Canon—a deep gorge that is lateral to the once populated
valley of the Rio de Chelly, Arizona—stands a stark spire of weathered
sandstone, its top rising eight hundred feet above its base in a sheer
uplift. Centuries ago an inhabitant of one of the cave villages was
surprised by hostiles while hunting in this region, and was chased by
them into this canon. As he ran he looked vainly from side to side in
the hope of securing a hiding-place, but succor came from a source that
was least expected, for on approaching this enormous obelisk, with
strength well-nigh exhausted, he saw a silken cord hanging from a notch
at its top. Hastily knotting the end about his waist, that it might not
fall within reach of his pursuers, he climbed up, setting his feet into
roughnesses of the stone, and advancing, hand over hand, until he had
reached the summit, where he stayed, drinking dew and feeding on eagles'
eggs, until his enemies went away, for they could not reach him with
their arrows, defended as he was by points of rock. The foemen having
gone, he safely descended by the cord and reached his home. This help
had come from a friendly spider who saw his plight from her perch at the
top of the spire, and, weaving a web of extra thickness, she made one
end fast to a jag of rock while the other fell within his grasp—for she,
like all other of the brute tribe, liked the gentle cave-dwellers better
than the remorseless hunters. Hence the name of the Spider Tower.
