### THE SACRED FIRE OF NACHEZ

The Indians of the South, being in contact with the civilized races of
Central America, were among the most progressive and honorable of the
red men. They were ruled by intelligence rather than force, and
something of the respect that Europeans feel for their kingly families
made them submit to woman's rule. The valley of Nacooche, Georgia,
indeed, perpetuates in its name one of these princesses of a royal
house, for though she ruled a large tribe with wisdom she was not
impervious to the passions of common mortals. The "Evening Star" died by
her own hand, being disappointed in love affair. Her story is that of
Juliet, and she and her lover—united in death, as they could not be in
life—are buried beneath a mound in the centre of he valley.

The Indians of that region had towns built for permanency, and possessed
some knowledge of the arts, while in religion their belief and rites
were curiously like those of the Persian fire-worshippers. It was on the
site of the present city in Mississippi which bears their name that the
Natchez Indians built their Temple of the Sun. When it was finished a
meteor fell from heaven and kindled the fire on their altar, and from
that hour the priests guarded he flame continually, until one night when
it was extinguished by mischance. This event was believed to be an omen,
and the people so took it to heart that when the white men came,
directly after, they had little courage to prosecute a war, and fell
back before the conqueror, never to hold their ancient home again.
