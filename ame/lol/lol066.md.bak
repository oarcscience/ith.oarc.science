### THE PHANTOM DRUMMER

Colonel Howell, of the king's troops, was a gay fellow, framed to make
women false; but when he met the rosy, sweet-natured daughter of farmer
Jarrett, near Valley Forge, he attempted no dalliance, for he fell too
seriously in love. He might not venture into the old man's presence, for
Jarrett had a son with Washington, and he hated a red-coat as he did the
devil; but the young officer met the girl in secret, and they plighted
troth beneath the garden trees, hidden in gray mist. As Howell bent to
take his first kiss that night, a rising wind went past, bringing from
afar the roll of a drum, and as they talked the drum kept drawing
nearer, until it seemed at hand. The officer peered across the wall,
then hurried to his mistress' side, as pale as death. The fields outside
were empty of life.

Louder came the rattling drum; it seemed to enter the gate, pass but a
yard away, go through the wall, and die in the distance. When it ceased,
Howell started as if a spell had been lifted, laxed his grip on the
maiden's hand, then drew her to his breast convulsively. Ruth's terror
was more vague but no less genuine than his own, and some moments passed
before she could summon voice to ask him what this visitation meant. He
answered, "Something is about to change my fortunes for good or ill;
probably for ill. Important events in my family for the past three
generations have been heralded by that drum, and those events were
disasters oftener than benefits." Few more words passed, and with
another kiss the soldier scaled the wall and galloped away, the triple
beat of his charger's hoofs sounding back into the maiden's ears like
drum-taps. In a skirmish next day Colonel Howell was shot. He was
carried to farmer Jarrett's house and left there, in spite of the old
man's protest, for he was willing to give no shelter to his country's
enemies. When Ruth saw her lover in this strait she was like to have
fallen, but when she learned that it would take but a few days of quiet
and care to restore him to health, she was ready to forgive her
fellow-countrymen for inflicting an injury that might result in
happiness for both of them.

It took a great deal of teasing to overcome the scruples of the farmer,
but he gruffly consented to receive the young man until his hurt should
heal. Ruth attended him faithfully, and the cheerful, manly nature of
the officer so won the farmer's heart that he soon forgot the color of
Howell's coat. Nor was he surprised when Howell told him that he loved
his daughter and asked for her hand; indeed, it had been easy to guess
their affection, and the old man declared that but for his allegiance to
a tyrant he would gladly own him as a son-in-law. It was a long struggle
between love and duty that ensued in Howell's breast, and love was
victor. If he might marry Ruth he would leave the army. The old man gave
prompt consent, and a secret marriage was arranged. Howell had been
ordered to rejoin his regiment; he could not honorably resign on the eve
of an impending battle, and, even had he done so, a long delay must have
preceded his release. He would marry the girl, go to the country, live
there quietly until the British evacuated Philadelphia, when he would
return and cast his lot with the Jarrett household.

Howell donned citizen's dress, and the wedding took place in the
spacious best room of the mansion, but as he slipped the ring on the
finger of his bride the roll of a drum was heard advancing up the steps
into the room, then on and away until all was still again. The young
colonel was pale; Ruth clung to him in terror; clergymen and guests
looked at each other in amazement. Now there were voices at the porch,
the door was flung open, armed men entered, and the bridegroom was a
prisoner. He was borne to his quarters, and afterward tried for
desertion, for a servant in the Jarrett household, hating all English
and wishing them to suffer, even at each other's hands, had betrayed the
plan of his master's guest. The court-martial found him guilty and
condemned him to be shot. When the execution took place, Ruth, praying
and sobbing in her chamber, knew that her husband was no more. The
distant sound of musketry reverberated like the roll of a drum.
