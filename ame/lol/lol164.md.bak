### ROBERT LOCKWOOD'S FATE

In the winter of 1779, General Putnam was stationed at Reading,
Connecticut, with a band of ill-fed, unpaid troops. He was quartered at
the Marvin house, and Mary, daughter of farmer Marvin, won her way to
the heart of this rough soldier through the excellence of her dumplings
and the invigorating quality of her flip. He even took her into his
confidence, and, being in want of a spy in an emergency, he playfully
asked her if she knew any brave fellow who could be trusted to take a
false message into the British lines that would avert an impending
attack. Yes, she knew such an one, and would guarantee that he would
take the message if the fortunes of the colonial army would be helped
thereby. Putnam assured her that it would aid the patriot cause, and,
farther, that he would reward her; whereat, with a smile and a twinkling
eye, the girl received the missive and left the room.

When daylight had left the sky, Mary slipped out of the house, crossed a
pasture, entered a ravine, and in a field beyond reached a cattle
shelter. On the instant a tall form stepped from the shadows and she
sank into its embrace. There was a kiss, a moment of whispered talk, and
the girl hurriedly asked her lover if he would carry a letter to the
British headquarters, near Ridgefield. Of course he would. But he must
not read it, and he must on no account say from whom he had it. The
young man consented without a question—that she required it was
sufficient; so, thrusting the tiny paper into his hand and bidding him
God-speed, she gave him another kiss and they parted—he to go on his
errand, she to pass the night with the clergyman's daughter at the
parsonage. At about ten o'clock Putnam was disturbed by the tramping of
feet and a tall, goodlooking fellow was thrust into his room by a couple
of soldiers. The captive had been found inside the lines, they said, in
consultation with some unknown person who had escaped the eye of the
sentry in the darkness. When captured he had put a piece of paper into
his mouth and swallowed it. He gave the name of Robert Lockwood, and
when Putnam demanded to know what he had been doing near the camp
without a permit he said that he was bound by a promise not to tell.

"Are you a patriot?" asked the general.

"I am a royalist. I do not sympathize with rebellion. I have been a man
of peace in this war."

Putnam strode about the room, giving vent to his passion in language
neither choice nor gentle, for he had been much troubled by spies and
informers since he had been there. Then, stopping, he said:

"Some one was with you to-night-some of my men. Tell me that traitor's
name and I'll spare your life and hang him before the whole army."

The prisoner turned pale and dropped his head. He would not violate his
promise.

"You are a British spy, and I'll hang you at sunrise!" roared Putnam.

In vain the young man pleaded for time to appeal to Washington. He was
not a spy, he insisted, and it would be found, perhaps too late, that a
terrible mistake had been committed. His words were unheeded: he was led
away and bound, and as the sun was rising on the next morning the
sentence of courtmartial was executed upon him.

At noon Mary returned from the parsonage, her eyes dancing and her mouth
dimpling with smiles. Going to Putnam, she said, with a dash of
sauciness, "I have succeeded, general. I found a lad last night to take
your message. I had to meet him alone, for he is a Tory; so he cannot
enter this camp. The poor fellow had no idea that he was doing a service
for the rebels, for he did not know what was in the letter, and I bound
him not to tell who gave it to him. You see, I punished him for abiding
by the king."

The general laughed and gazed at her admiringly.

"You're a brave girl," he said, "and I suppose you've come for your
reward. Well, what is it to be?"

"I want a pass for Robert Lockwood. He is the royalist I spoke of, but
he will not betray you, for he is not a soldier; and—his visits make me
very happy."

"The spy you hanged this morning," whispered an aide in Putnam's ear.
"Give her the pass and say nothing of what has happened."

The general started, changed color, and paused; then he signed the order
with a dash, placed it in the girl's hand, gravely kissed her, watched
her as she ran lightly from the house, and going to his bedroom closed
the door and remained alone for an hour. From that time he never spoke
of the affair, but when his troops were ordered away, soon after, he
almost blenched as he gave good-by to Mary Marvin, and met her sad,
reproachful look, though to his last day he never learned whether or no
she had discovered Robert Lockwood's fate.
