### THE HUNDREDTH SKULL

In the early part of this century Bill Quick, trapper and frontiersman,
lived in a cabin on the upper Scioto, not far from the present town of
Kenton, Ohio. One evening when he returned from the hunt he found his
home rifled of its contents and his aged father weltering in his blood
on the floor. He then and there took oath that he would be revenged a
hundredfold. His mission was undertaken at once, and for many a year
thereafter the Indians of the region had cause to dread the doom that
came to them from brake and wood and fen,—now death by knife that
flashed at them from behind a tree, and the next instant whirled through
the air and was buried to the hilt in a red man's heart; now, by bullet
as they rowed across the rivers; now, by axe that clove their skulls as
they lay asleep.

Bill Quick worked secretly, and, unlike other men of the place and time,
he did not take his trophies Indian-fashion. The scalp was not enough.
He took the head. And presently a row of grinning skulls was ranged upon
his shelves. Ninety-nine of these ghastly prizes occupied his cabin, and
the man was confident that he should accomplish his intent. But the
Indians, in terror, were falling away toward the lakes; they were
keeping better guard; and ere the hundredth man had fallen before his
rifle he was seized with fatal illness. Calling to him his son, Tom, he
pointed to the skulls, and charged him to fulfil the oath he had taken
by adding to the list a hundredth skull. Should he fail in this the
murdered ancestor and he himself would come back to haunt the laggard.
Tom accepted the trust, but everything seemed to work against him. He
never was much of a hunter nor a very true shot, and he had no liking
for war; besides, the Indians had left the country, as he fancied. So he
grumbled at the uncongenial task appointed for him and kept deferring it
from week to week and from year to year. When his conscience pricked him
he allayed the smart with drink, and his conscience seemed to grow more
active as he grew older.

On returning to the cabin after a carouse he declared that he had heard
voices, that the skulls gibbered and cracked their teeth together as if
mocking his weakness, and that a phosphorescent glare shone through the
sockets of their eyes. In his cups he prattled his secret, and soon the
whole country knew that he was under oath to kill a red-skin-and the
country laughed at him. On a certain day it was reported that a band of
Indians had been seen in the neighborhood, and what with drink and the
taunts of his friends, he was impelled to take his rifle and set out
once more on the war-path. A settler heard a shot fired not long after.
Next day a neighbor passing Tom Quick's cabin tapped at the door, and,
receiving no answer, pushed it open and entered. The hundredth skull was
there, on the shelves, a bullet-hole in the forehead, and the scalp
gone. The head was Quick's.
