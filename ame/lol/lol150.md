### LOVE AND TREASON

The tribes that inhabited Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard before the
whites settled the country were constantly at war, and the people of the
western island once resolved to surprise those of Nantucket and slay as
many as possible before they could arm or organize for battle. The
attack was to be made before daybreak, at an hour when their intended
victims would be asleep in their wigwams, but on rowing softly to the
hostile shore, while the stars were still lingering in the west, the
warriors were surprised at finding the enemy alert and waiting their
arrival with bows and spears in hand. To proceed would have been
suicidal, and they returned to their villages, puzzled and disheartened.
Not for some years did they learn how the camp had been apprised, but at
the end of that time, the two tribes being at peace, one of their young
men married a girl of Nantucket, with whom he had long been in love, and
confessed that on the night preceding the attack he had stolen to the
beach, crossed to Nantucket on a neck of sand that then joined the
islands, and was uncovered only at low tide, sought his mistress, warned
her of the attack, that she, at least, might not be killed; then, at a
mad run, with waves of the rising tide lapping his feet, he returned to
his people, who had not missed him. He set off with a grave and innocent
face in the morning, and was as much surprised as any one when he found
the enemy in arms.
