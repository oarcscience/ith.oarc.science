### TWELFTH NIGHT AT CAHOKIA

It was Twelfth Night, and the French village of Cahokia, near St. Louis,
was pleasantly agitated at the prospect of a dance in the old court
saloon, which was assembly-room and everything else for the little
place. The thirteen holy fires were alight—a large one, to represent
Christ; a lesser one, to be trampled out by the crowd, typing Judas. The
twelfth cake, one slice with the ring in it, was cut, and there were
drink and laughter, but, as yet, no music. Gwen Malhon, a drift-wood
collector, was the most anxious to get over the delay, for he had begged
a dance from Louison. Louison Florian was pretty, not badly off in
possessions and prospects, and her lover, Beaurain, had gone away. She
was beginning to look a little scornful and impatient, so Gwen set off
for a fiddler.

He had inquired at nearly every cabin without success, and was on his
way toward the ferry when he heard music. Before him, on the moonlit
river, was a large boat, and near it, on the bank, he saw a company of
men squatted about a fire and bousing together from a bottle. At a
little distance, on a stump, sat a thin, bent man, enveloped in a cloak,
and it was he who played. Gwen complimented him and pleaded the
disappointment of the dancers in excuse of an urgent appeal that he
should hurry with him to the court saloon. The stranger was courteous.
He sprang into the road with a limping bound, shook down his cloak so as
to disclose a curled moustache, shaggy brows, a goat's beard, and a pair
of glittering eyes. "I'll give them a dance!" he exclaimed. "I know one
tune. They call it 'Returned from the Grave.' Pay? We'll see how you
like my playing."

On entering the room where the caperish youth were already shuffling in
corners, the musician met Mamzel Florian, who offered him a slice of the
cake. He bent somewhat near to take it, and she gave a little cry. He
had found the ring, and that made him king of the festival, with the
right to choose the prettiest girl as queen. A long drink of red wine
seemed to put him in the best of trim, and he began to fiddle with a
verve that was irresistible. In one minute the whole company—including
the priest, some said—was jigging it lustily. "Whew!" gasped one old
fellow. "It is the devil who plays. Get some holy water and sprinkle the
floor."

Gwen watched the musician as closely as his labors would allow, for he
did not like the way the fiddler had of looking at Louison, and he
thought to himself that Louison never blushed so prettily for him.
Forgetting himself when he saw the fiddler smile at the girl, he made a
rush for the barrel where that artist was perched. He bumped against a
dancer and fell. At that moment the light was put out and the hall rang
with screams and laughter. The tones of one voice sounded above the
rest: "By right of the ring the girl is mine."

"He has me," Louison was heard to say, yet seemingly not in fear. Lights
were brought. Louison and the fiddler were gone, the stranger's cloak
and half of a false moustache were on the floor, while Gwen was jammed
into the barrel and was kicking desperately to get out. When released he
rushed for the river-side where he had seen the boat. Two figures
flitted before him, but he lost sight of them, and in the silence and
loneliness his choler began to cool. Could it really have been the
devil? An owl hooted in the bush. He went away in haste. There was a
rumor in after years that Beaurain was an actor in a company that went
up and down the great river on a barge, and that a woman who resembled
Louison was also in the troupe. But Gwen never told the story of his
disappointment without crossing himself.
