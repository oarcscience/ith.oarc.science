### MOODUS NOISES

The village of Moodus, Connecticut, was troubled with noises. There is
no question as to that. In fact, Machimoodus, the Indian name of the
spot, means Place of Noises. As early as 1700, and for thirty years
after, there were crackings and rumblings that were variously compared
to fusillades, to thunder, to roaring in the air, to the breaking of
rocks, to reports of cannon. A man who was on Mount Tom while the noises
were violent describes the sound as that of rocks falling into immense
caverns beneath his feet and striking against cliffs as they fell.
Houses shook and people feared.

Rev. Mr. Hosmer, in a letter written to a friend in Boston in 1729, says
that before white settlers appeared there was a large Indian population,
that powwows were frequent, and that the natives "drove a prodigious
trade at worshipping the devil." He adds:—"An old Indian was asked what
was the reason of the noises in this place, to which he replied that the
Indian's god was angry because Englishman's god was come here. Now,
whether there be anything diabolical in these things I know not, but
this I know, that God Almighty is to be seen and trembled at in what has
been often heard among us. Whether it be fire or air distressed in the
subterranean caverns of the earth cannot be known for there is no
eruption, no explosion perceptible but by sounds and tremors which are
sometimes very fearful and dreadful."

It was finally understood that Haddam witches, who practised black
magic, met the Moodus witches, who used white magic, in a cave beneath
Mount Tom, and fought them in the light of a great carbuncle that was
fastened to the roof. The noises recurred in 1888, when houses rattled
in witch-haunted Salem, eight miles away, and the bell on the village
church "sung like a tuning-fork." The noises have occurred
simultaneously with earthquakes in other parts of the country, and
afterward rocks have been found moved from their bases and cracks have
been discovered in the earth. One sapient editor said that the pearls in
the mussels in Salmon and Connecticut Rivers caused the disturbance.

If the witch-fights were continued too long the king of Machimoddi, who
sat on a throne of solid sapphire in the cave whence the noises came,
raised his wand: then the light of the carbuncle went out, peals of
thunder rolled through the rocky chambers, and the witches rushed into
the air. Dr. Steele, a learned and aged man from England, built a
crazy-looking house in a lonely spot on Mount Tom, and was soon as much
a mystery as the noises, for it was known that he had come to this
country to stop them by magic and to seize the great carbuncle in the
cave—if he could find it. Every window, crack, and keyhole was closed,
and nobody was admitted while he stayed there, but the clang of hammers
was heard in his house all night, sparks shot from his chimney, and
strange odors were diffused. When all was ready for his adventure he set
forth, his path marked by a faint light that moved before him and
stopped at the closed entrance to the cavern.

Loud were the Moodus noises that night. The mountain shook and groans
and hisses were heard in the air as he pried up the stone that lay
across the pit-mouth. When he had lifted it off a light poured from it
and streamed into the heaven like a crimson comet or a spear of the
northern aurora. It was the flash of the great carbuncle, and the stars
seen through it were as if dyed in blood. In the morning Steele was
gone. He had taken ship for England. The gem carried with it an evil
fate, for the galley sank in mid-ocean; but, though buried beneath a
thousand fathoms of water, the red ray of the carbuncle sometimes shoots
up from the sea, and the glow of it strikes fear into the hearts of
passing sailors. Long after, when the booming was heard, the Indians
said that the hill was giving birth to another beautiful stone.

Such cases are not singular. A phenomenon similar to the Moodus noises,
and locally known as "the shooting of Nashoba Hill," occurs at times in
the eminence of that name near East Littleton, Massachusetts. The
strange, deep rumbling was attributed by the Indians to whirlwinds
trying to escape from caves.

Bald Mountain, North Carolina, was known as Shaking Mountain, for
strange sounds and tremors were heard there, and every moonshiner who
had his cabin on that hill joined the church and was diligent in worship
until he learned that the trembling was due to the slow cracking and
separation of a great ledge.

At the end of a hot day on Seneca Lake, New York, are sometimes heard
the "lake guns," like exploding gas. Two hundred years ago Agayentah, a
wise and honored member of the Seneca tribe, was killed here by a
lightning-stroke. The same bolt that slew him wrenched a tree from the
bank and hurled it into the water, where it was often seen afterward,
going about the lake as if driven by unseen currents, and among the
whites it got the name of the Wandering Jew. It is often missing for
weeks together, and its reappearances are heralded by the low booming
of—what? The Indians said that the sound was but the echo of Agayentah's
voice, warning them of dangers and summoning them to battle, while the
Wandering Jew became his messenger.
