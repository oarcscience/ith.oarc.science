### BLOCK ISLAND AND THE PALATINE

Block Island, or Manisees, is an uplift of clayey moorland between
Montauk and Gay Head. It was for sailors an evil place and "bad
medicine" for Indians, for men who had been wrecked there had been
likewise robbed and ill treated—though the honest islanders of to-day
deny it—while the Indians had been driven from their birthright after
hundreds of their number had fallen in its defence. In the winter of
1750-51 the ship Palatine set forth over the seas with thrifty Dutch
merchants and emigrants, bound for Philadelphia, with all their goods. A
gale delayed them and kept them beating to and fro on the icy seas,
unable to reach land. The captain died—it was thought that he was
murdered—and the sailors, a brutal set even for those days, threw off
all discipline, seized the stores and arms, and starved the passengers
into giving up their money.

When those died of hunger whose money had given out—for twenty guilders
were demanded for a cup of water and fifty six dollars for a
biscuit—their bodies were flung into the sea, and when the crew had
secured all that excited their avarice they took to their boats, leaving
ship and passengers to their fate. It is consoling to know that the
sailors never reached a harbor. The unguided ship, in sight of land, yet
tossed at the mercy of every wind and tenanted by walking skeletons,
struck off Block Island one calm Sunday morning and the wreckers who
lived along the shore set out for her. Their first work was to rescue
the passengers; then they returned to strip everything from the hulk
that the crew had left; but after getting her in tow a gale sprang up,
and seeing that she was doomed to be blown off shore, where she might
become a dangerous obstruction or a derelict, they set her on fire. From
the rocks they watched her drift into misty darkness, but as the flames
mounted to the trucks a scream rang across the whitening sea: a maniac
woman had been left on board. The scream was often repeated, each time
more faintly, and the ship passed into the fog and vanished.

A twelvemonth later, on the same evening of the year, the islanders were
startled at the sight of a ship in the offing with flames lapping up her
sides and rigging, and smoke clouds rolling off before the wind. It
burned to the water's edge in sight of hundreds. In the winter following
it came again, and was seen, in fact, for years thereafter at regular
intervals, by those who would gladly have forgotten the sight of it (one
of the community, an Indian, fell into madness whenever he saw the
light), while those who listened caught the sound of a woman's voice
raised in agony above the roar of fire and water.

Substantially the same story is told of a point on the North Carolina
coast, save that in the latter case the passengers, who were from the
Bavarian Palatinate, were put to the knife before their goods were
taken. The captain and his crew filled their boats with treasure and
pulled away for land, first firing the ship and committing its ghastly
freight to the flames. The ship followed them almost to the beach, ere
it fell to pieces, as if it were an animate form, bent on vengeance. The
pirates landed, but none profited by the crime, all of them dying poor
and forsaken.
