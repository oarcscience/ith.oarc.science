### THE SHRIEKING WOMAN

During the latter part of the seventeenth century a Spanish ship, richly
laden, was beset off Marblehead by English pirates, who killed every
person on board, at the time of the capture, except a beautiful English
lady, a passenger on the ship, who was brought ashore at night and
brutally murdered at a ledge of rocks near Oakum Bay. As the fishermen
who lived near were absent in their boats, the women and children, who
were startled from their sleep by her piercing shrieks, dared not
attempt a rescue. Taking her a little way from shore in their boat, the
pirates flung her into the sea, and as she came to the surface and
clutched the gunwale they hewed at her hands with cutlasses. She was
heard to cry, "Lord, save me! Mercy! O, Lord Jesus, save me!" Next day
the people found her mangled body on the rocks, and, with bitter
imprecations at the worse than beasts that had done this wrong, they
prepared it for burial. It was interred where it was found, but,
although it was committed to the earth with Christian forms, for one
hundred and fifty years the victim's cries and appeals were repeated, on
each anniversary of the crime, with such distinctness as to affright all
who heard them—and most of the citizens of Marblehead claimed to be of
that number.
