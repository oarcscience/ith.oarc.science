### OLD ESTHER DUDLEY

Boston had surrendered. Washington was advancing from the heights where
he had trained his guns on the British works, and Sir William Howe
lingered at the door of Province House,—last of the royal governors who
would stand there,—and cursed and waved his hands and beat his heel on
the step, as if he were crushing rebellion by that act. The sound
brought an old woman to his side. "Esther Dudley!" he exclaimed. "Why
are you not gone?"

"I shall never leave. As housekeeper for the governors and pensioner of
the king, this has been my home; the only home I know. Go back, but send
more troops. I will keep the house till you return."

"Grant that I may return," he cried. "Since you will stay, take this bag
of guineas and keep this key until a governor shall demand it."

Then, with fierce and moody brow, the governor went forth, and the faded
eyes of Esther Dudley saw him nevermore. When the soldiers of the
republic cast about for quarters in Boston town, they spared the
official mansion to this old woman. Her bridling toryism and assumption
of old state amused them and did no harm; indeed, her loyalty was half
admired; beside, nobody took the pride in the place that she did, or
would keep it in better order. That she sometimes had a half-dozen of
unrepentant codgers in to dinner, and that they were suspected of
drinking healths to George III. in crusted port, was a fact to blink.
Rumor had it that not all her guests were flesh and blood, but that she
had an antique mirror across which ancient occupants of the house would
pass in shadowy procession at her command, and that she was wont to have
the Shirleys, Olivers, Hutchinsons, and Dudleys out of their graves to
hold receptions there; so a touch of dread may have mingled in the
feeling that kept the populace aloof.

Living thus by herself, refusing to hear of rebel victories, construing
the bonfires, drumming, hurrahs, and bell-ringing to signify fresh
triumphs for England, she drifted farther and farther out of her time
and existed in the shadows of the past. She lighted the windows for the
king's birthday, and often from the cupola watched for a British fleet,
heeding not the people below, who, as they saw her withered face,
repeated the prophecy, with a laugh "When the golden Indian on Province
House shall shoot his arrow and the cock on South Church spire shall
crow, look for a royal governor again." So, when it was bandied about
the streets that the governor was coming, she took it in no wise
strange, but dressed herself in silk and hoops, with store of ancient
jewels, and made ready to receive him. In truth, there was a function,
for already a man of stately mien, and richly dressed, was advancing
through the court, with a staff of men in wigs and laced coats behind
him, and a company of troops at a little distance. Esther Dudley flung
the door wide and dropping on her knees held forth the key with the cry,
"Thank heaven for this hour! God save the king!"

The governor put off his hat and helped the woman to her feet. "A
strange prayer," said he; "yet we will echo it to this effect: For the
good of the realm that still owns him to be its ruler, God save King
George."

Esther Dudley stared wildly. That face she remembered now,—the
proscribed rebel, John Hancock; governor, not by royal grant, but by the
people's will.

"Have I welcomed a traitor? Then let me die."

"Alas! Mistress Dudley, the world has changed for you in these later
years. America has no king." He offered her his arm, and she clung to it
for a moment, then, sinking down, the great key, that she so long had
treasured, clanked to the floor.

"I have been faithful unto death," she gasped. "God save the king!"

The people uncovered, for she was dead.

"At her tomb," said Hancock, "we will bid farewell forever to the past.
A new day has come for us. In its broad light we will press onward."
