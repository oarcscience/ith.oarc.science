### THE COURTSHIP OF MYLES STANDISH

Myles Standish, compact, hard-headed little captain of the Puritan guard
at Plymouth, never knew the meaning of fear until he went a-courting
Priscilla Mullins—or was she a Molines, as some say? He had fought white
men and red men and never reeked of danger in the doing it, but his
courage sank to his boots whenever this demure maiden glanced at him, as
he thought, with approval. Odd, too, for he had been married once, and
Rose was not so long dead that he had forgotten the ways and likings of
women; but he made no progress in his suit, and finally chose John Alden
to urge it for him. John—who divides with Mary Chilton the honor of
being first to land on Plymouth Rock—was a well-favored lad of
twenty-two. Until he could build a house for himself he shared
Standish's cottage and looked up to that worthy as a guardian, but it
was a hard task that was set for him now. He went to goodman Mullins
with a slow step and sober countenance and asked leave to plead his
protector's cause. The father gave it, called his daughter in, and left
them together; then, with noble faith to his mission, the young man
begged the maiden's hand for the captain, dwelling on his valor,
strength, wisdom, his military greatness, his certainty of promotion,
his noble lineage, and all good attributes he could endow him with.

Priscilla kept at her spinning while this harangue went on, but the
drone of the wheel did not prevent her noting a sigh and a catch of the
breath that interrupted the discourse now and then. She flushed as she
replied, "Why does not Captain Standish come to me himself? If I am
worth the winning I ought to be worth the wooing."

But John Alden seemed not to notice the girl's confusion until, in a
pause in his eloquence, Priscilla bent her head a little, as if to mend
a break in the flax, and said, "Prithee, John, why don't you speak for
yourself?"

Then a great light broke on the understanding of John Alden, and a great
warmth welled up in his heart, and—they were married. Myles
Standish—well, some say that he walked in the wedding procession, while
one narrator holds that the sturdy Roundhead tramped away to the woods,
where he sat for a day, hating himself, and that he never forgave his
protege nor the maiden who took advantage of leap year. However that may
be, the wedding was a happy one, and the Aldens of all America claim
John and Priscilla for their ancestors.
