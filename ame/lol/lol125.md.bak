### THE WHITE DEER OF ONOTA

Beside quiet Onota, in the Berkshire Hills, dwelt a band of Indians, and
while they lived here a white deer often came to drink. So rare was the
appearance of an animal like this that its visits were held as good
omens, and no hunter of the tribe ever tried to slay it. A prophet of
the race had said, "So long as the white doe drinks at Onota, famine
shall not blight the Indian's harvest, nor pestilence come nigh his
lodge, nor foeman lay waste his country." And this prophecy held true.
That summer when the deer came with a fawn as white and graceful as
herself, it was a year of great abundance. On the outbreak of the French
and Indian War a young officer named Montalbert was despatched to the
Berkshire country to persuade the Housatonic Indians to declare
hostility to the English, and it was as a guest in the village of Onota
that he heard of the white deer. Sundry adventurers had made valuable
friendships by returning to the French capital with riches and
curiosities from the New World. Even Indians had been abducted as gifts
for royalty, and this young ambassador resolved that when he returned to
his own country the skin of the white deer should be one of the trophies
that would win him a smile from Louis.

He offered a price for it—a price that would have bought all their
possessions and miles of the country roundabout, but their deer was
sacred, and their refusal to sacrifice it was couched in such indignant
terms that he wisely said no more about it in the general hearing. There
was in the village a drunken fellow, named Wondo, who had come to that
pass when he would almost have sold his soul for liquor, and him the
officer led away and plied with rum until he promised to bring the white
doe to him. The pretty beast was so familiar with men that she suffered
Wondo to catch her and lead her to Montalbert. Making sure that none was
near, the officer plunged his sword into her side and the innocent
creature fell. The snowy skin, now splashed with red, was quickly
stripped off, concealed among the effects in Montalbert's outfit, and he
set out for Canada; but he had not been many days on his road before
Wondo, in an access of misery and repentance, confessed to his share of
the crime that had been done and was slain on the moment.

With the death of the deer came an end to good fortune. Wars, blights,
emigration followed, and in a few years not a wigwam was left standing
beside Onota.

There is a pendant to this legend, incident to the survival of the
deer's white fawn. An English hunter, visiting the lake with dog and
gun, was surprised to see on its southern bank a white doe. The animal
bent to drink and at the same moment the hunter put his gun to his
shoulder. Suddenly a howl was heard, so loud, so long, that the woods
echoed it, and the deer, taking alarm, fled like the wind. The howl came
from the dog, and, as that animal usually showed sagacity in the
presence of game, the hunter was seized with a fear that its form was
occupied, for the time, by a hag who lived alone in the "north woods,"
and who was reputed to have appeared in many shapes—for this was not so
long after witch times that their influence was forgotten.

Drawing his ramrod, the man gave his dog such a beating that the poor
creature had something worth howling for, because it might be the witch
that he was thrashing. Then running to the shanty of the suspected woman
he flung open her door and demanded to see her back, for, if she had
really changed her shape, every blow that he had given to the dog would
have been scored on her skin. When he had made his meaning clear, the
crone laid hold on the implement that served her for horse at night, and
with the wooden end of it rained blows on him so rapidly that, if the
dog had had half the meanness in his nature that some people have, the
spectacle would have warmed his heart, for it was a prompt and severe
revenge for his sufferings. And to the last the hunter could not decide
whether the beating that he received was prompted by indignation or
vengeance.
