### THE SWALLOWING EARTHQUAKE

The Indian village that in 1765 stood just below the site of Oxford,
Alabama, was upset when the news was given out that two of the squaws
had given simultaneous birth to a number of children that were spotted
like leopards. Such an incident betokened the existence of some baneful
spirit among them that had no doubt leagued itself with the women, who
were at once tried on the charge of witchcraft, convicted, and sentenced
to death at the stake, while a watch was to be set on the infants, so
early orphaned, lest they, too, should show signs of malevolent
possession. The whole tribe, seventeen hundred in number, assembled to
see the execution, but hardly were the fires alight when a sound like
thunder rolled beneath their feet, and with a hideous crack and groan
the earth opened and nearly every soul was engulfed in a fathomless and
smoking pit-all, indeed, save two, for a couple of young braves who were
on the edge of the crowd flung themselves flat on the heaving ground and
remained there until the earthquake wave had passed. The hollow
afterward filled with water and was called Blue Pond. It is popularly
supposed to be fathomless, but it was shown that a forest once spread
across the bottom, when, but a few years ago, a great tree arose from
the water, lifting first its branches, then turning so as to show its
roots above the surface, and afterward disappeared.
