### THE UNKNOWN CHAMPION

There was that in the very air of the New World that made the Pilgrims
revolt against priests and kings. The Revolution was long a-breeding
before shots were fired at Lexington. Stout old Endicott, having
conceived a dislike to the British flag because to his mind the cross
was a relic of popery, paraded his soldiers and with his sword ripped
out the offending emblem in their presence. There was a faint cry of
"Treason!" but he answered, "I will avouch the deed before God and man.
Beat a flourish, drummer. Shout for the ensign of New England. Pope nor
tyrant hath part in it now." And a loud huzza of independence went
forth.

With this sentiment confirmed among the people, it is not surprising
that the judges who had condemned a papist king—Charles I.—to the block
should find welcome in this land. For months at a time they lived in
cellars and garrets in various parts of New England, their hiding-places
kept secret from the royal sheriffs who were seeking them. For a time
they had shelter in a cave in West Rock, New Haven, and once in that
town they were crouching beneath the bridge that a pursuing party
crossed in search of them. In Ipswich the house is pointed out where
they were concealed in the cellar, and the superstitious believed that,
as a penalty for their regicidal decision, they are doomed to stay
there, crying vainly for deliverance.

Philip, the Narragansett chief, had declared war on the people of New
England, and was waging it with a persistence and fury that spread
terror through the country. It was a struggle against manifest destiny,
such as must needs be repeated whenever civilization comes to dispute a
place in new lands with savagery, and which has been continued, more and
more feebly, to our own day. The war was bloody, and for a long time the
issue hung in the balance. At last the Indian king was driven westward.
The Nipmucks joined him in the Connecticut Valley, and he laid siege to
the lonely settlements of Brookfield, Northfield, Deerfield, and
Springfield, killing, scalping, and burning without mercy. On the 1st of
September, 1675, he attacked Hadley while its people were at church, the
war-yelp interrupting a prayer of the pastor. All the men of the
congregation sallied out with pikes and guns and engaged the foe, but so
closely were they pressed that a retreat was called, when suddenly there
appeared among them a tall man, of venerable and commanding aspect, clad
in leather, and armed with sword and gun.

His hair and beard were long and white, but his eye was dark and
resolute, and his voice was strong. "Why sink your hearts?" he cried.
"Fear ye that God will give you up to yonder heathen dogs? Follow me,
and ye shall see that this day there is a champion in Israel."

Posting half the force at his command to sustain the fight, he led the
others quickly by a detour to the rear of the Indians, on whom he fell
with such energy that the savages, believing themselves overtaken by
reinforcements newly come, fled in confusion. When the victors returned
to the village the unknown champion signed to the company to fall to
their knees while he offered thanks and prayer. Then he was silent for a
little, and when they looked up he was gone.

They believed him to be an angel sent for their deliverance, nor, till
he had gone to his account, did they know that their captain in that
crisis was Colonel William Goffe, one of the regicide judges, who, with
his associate Whalley, was hiding from the vengeance of the son of the
king they had rebelled against. After leaving their cave in New Haven,
being in peril from beasts and human hunters, they went up the
Connecticut Valley to Hadley, where the clergyman of the place, Rev.
John Russell, gave them shelter for fifteen years. Few were aware of
their existence, and when Goffe, pale with seclusion from the light,
appeared among the people near whom he had long been living, it is no
wonder that they regarded him with awe.

Whalley died in the minister's house and was buried in a crypt outside
of the cellar-wall, while Goffe kept much abroad, stopping in many
places and under various disguises until his death, which occurred soon
after that of his associate. He was buried in New Haven.
