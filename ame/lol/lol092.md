### THE MOOSE OF MOUNT KINEO

Eastern traditions concerning Hiawatha differ in many respects from
those of the West. In the East he is known as Glooskap, god of the
Passamaquoddies, and his marks are left in many places in the maritime
provinces and Maine. It was he who gave names to things, created men,
filled them with life, and moved their wonder with storms. He lived on
the rocky height of Blomidon, at the entrance to Minas Basin, Nova
Scotia, and the agates to be found along its foot are jewels that he
made for his grandmother's necklace, when he restored her youth. He
threw up a ridge between Fort Cumberland and Parrsboro, Nova Scotia,
that he might cross, dry shod, the lake made by the beavers when they
dammed the strait at Blomidon, but he afterward killed the beavers, and
breaking down their dam he let the lake flow into the sea, and went
southward on a hunting tour. At Mount Desert he killed a moose, whose
bones he flung to the ground at Bar Harbor, where they are still to be
seen, turned to stone, while across the bay he threw the entrails, and
they, too, are visible as rocks, dented with his arrow-points. Mount
Kineo was anciently a cow moose of colossal size that he slew and turned
into a height of land, and the Indians trace the outline of the creature
in the uplift to this day. Little Kineo was a calf moose that he slew at
the same time, and Kettle Mountain is his camp-caldron that he flung to
the ground in the ardor of the chase.
