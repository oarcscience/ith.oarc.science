### SIREN OF THE FRENCH BROAD

Among the rocks east of Asheville, North Carolina, lives the Lorelei of
the French Broad River. This stream—the Tselica of the Indians—contains
in its upper reaches many pools where the rapid water whirls and
deepens, and where the traveller likes to pause in the heats of
afternoon and drink and bathe. Here, from the time when the Cherokees
occupied the country, has lived the siren, and if one who is weary and
downcast sits beside the stream or utters a wish to rest in it, he
becomes conscious of a soft and exquisite music blending with the plash
of the wave.

Looking down in surprise he sees—at first faintly, then with
distinctness—the form of a beautiful woman, with hair streaming like
moss and dark eyes looking into his, luring him with a power he cannot
resist. His breath grows short, his gaze is fixed, mechanically he
rises, steps to the brink, and lurches forward into the river. The arms
that catch him are slimy and cold as serpents; the face that stares into
his is a grinning skull. A loud, chattering laugh rings through the
wilderness, and all is still again.
