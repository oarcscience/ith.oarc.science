### THE CRIME OF BLACK SWAMP

Two miles south of Munger, Ohio, in the heart of what used to be called
the Black Swamp, stood the Woodbury House, a roomy mansion long gone to
decay. John Cleves, the last to live in it, was a man whose evil
practices got him into the penitentiary, but people had never associated
him with the queer sights and sounds in the lower chambers, nor with the
fact that a man named Syms, who had gone to that house in 1842, had
never been known to leave it. Ten years after Syms's disappearance it
happened that Major Ward and his friend John Stow had occasion to take
shelter there for the night—it being then deserted,—and, starting a
blaze in the parlor fireplace, they lit their pipes and talked till
late. Stow would have preferred a happier topic, but the major, who
feared neither man nor devil, constantly turned the talk on the evil
reputation of the house.

While they chatted a door opened with a creak and a human skeleton
appeared before them.

"What do you want? Speak!" cried Ward. But waiting for no answer he drew
his pistols and fired two shots at the grisly object. There was a
rattling sound, but the skeleton was neither dislocated nor
disconcerted. Advancing deliberately, with upraised arm, it said, in a
husky voice, "I, that am dead, yet live in a sense that mortals do not
know. In my earthly life I was James Syms, who was robbed and killed
here in my sleep by John Cleves." With bony finger it pointed to a
rugged gap in its left temple. "Cleves cut off my head and buried it
under the hearth. My body he cast into his well." At these words the
head disappeared and the voice was heard beneath the floor, "Take up my
skull." The watchers obeyed the call, and after digging a minute beneath
the hearth a fleshless head with a wound on the left temple came to
view. Ward took it into his hands, but in a twinkling it left them and
reappeared on the shoulders of the skeleton.

"I have long wanted to tell my fate," it resumed, "but could not until
one should be found brave enough to speak to me. I have appeared to
many, but you are the first who has commanded me to break my long
silence. Give my bones a decent burial. Write to my relative, Gilmore
Syms, of Columbus, Georgia, and tell him what I have revealed. I have
found peace." With a grateful gesture it extended its hand to Ward, who,
as he took it, shook like one with an ague, his wrist locked in its bony
clasp. As it released him it raised its hand impressively. A bluish
light burned at the doorway for an instant. The two men found themselves
alone.
