### LAKE SUPERIOR WATER GODS

There were many water gods about Lake Superior to whom the Indians paid
homage, casting implements, ornaments, and tobacco into the water
whenever they passed a spot where one of these manitous sat enthroned.
At Thunder Cape, on the north shore, lies Manibozho, and in the pillared
recess of La Chapelle, among the Pictured Rocks, dwelt powerful rulers
of the storm to whose mercy the red men commended themselves with quaint
rites whenever they were to set forth on a voyage over the great
unsalted sea. At Le Grand Portal were hidden a horde of mischievous
imps, among whose pranks was the repetition of every word spoken by the
traveller as he rested on his oars beneath this mighty arch. The
Chippewas worked the copper mines at Keweenaw Point before the white
race had learned of a Western land, but they did so timidly, for they
believed that a demon would visit with injury or death the rash mortal
who should presume to pillage his treasure, unless he had first bestowed
gifts upon him. Even then they went ashore with fear, lighted fires
around a surface of native copper, hacked off a few pounds of the
softened metal, and ran to their canoes without looking behind them.

There was another bad manitou at the mouth of Superior Bay, where
conflicting currents make a pother of waters. This spirit sat on the
bottom of the lake, gazing upward, and if any boatman ventured to cross
his domain without dropping a pipe or beads or hatchet into it, woe
betide him, for his boat would be caught in a current and smashed
against a rocky shore. Perhaps the most vexatious god was he who ruled
the Floating Islands. These islands were beautiful with trees and
flowers, metal shone and crystals sparkled on their ledges, sweet fruits
grew in plenty, and song-birds flitted over them. In wonder and delight
the hunter would speed toward them in his canoe, but as he neared their
turfy banks the jealous manitou, who kept these fairy lands for his own
pleasure, would throw down a fog and shut them out of sight. Never could
the hunter set foot on them, no matter how long he kept up his search.
