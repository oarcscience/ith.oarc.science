### XIII

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> person whom we are subjecting to this
process of psychoanalysis has a strong color sense, and wanted to be a
painter. So we note that she "gets" colors and names them correctly.
Here is my drawing of what I meant to be a bouquet of pink roses ([figs.
46, 46a](#img_fig046).md):

<span id="img_fig046"></span> ![Fig. 46, Fig, 46a](img/fig046.jpg.md)

Or take this case of a lobster. Craig's comment was: "Gorgeous colors,
red and greenish tinges." Apparently I had failed to decide whether I
was drawing a live lobster or a boiled one! My wife wrote further: "Now
it turns into a lizard, camelian \['Chameleon,' see above—JBH\], reds
and greens." When

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

she sees this about to be made public, she is embarrassed by her bad
spelling; but she says: "Please do not overlook the fact that a
chameleon is a reptile—and so is a lobster." I dutifully quote her, even
though her zoology is even worse than her spelling! ([figs. 47,
47a](#img_fig047).md):

<span id="img_fig047"></span> ![Fig. 47, Fig. 47a](img/fig047.jpg.md)

While we are on the "reptiles," I include this menacing crab, which may
have got hold of little Mary Craig's toe on the beach of the Mississippi
Sound ([fig. 48](#img_fig048).md):

<span id="img_fig048"></span> ![Fig. 48](img/fig048.jpg.md)

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

For the crab, Craig made two drawings, on opposite sides of the paper
([figs. 48a, 48b](#img_fig048a).md):

<span id="img_fig048a"></span> ![Fig. 48a, Fig. 48b](img/fig048a.jpg.md)

The comments on the above read: "Wings, or fingers—wing effect, but no
feathers, things like fingers instead of feathers. Then many little dots
which all disappear, and leave two of them, O O, as eyes of something."
And then, "Streamers flying from something."

Another color instance: I drew the head of a horse, and Craig drew a lot
of apparently promiscuous lines, and at various places wrote "yellow,"
"white," "blue," "(dark)," and then a general description, "Oriental."
Afterwards she said to me: "That looks like a complete failure; yet it
was so vivid, I can't be mistaken. Where did you get that horse?" Said
I: "I copied it from a Sunday supplement." We got the paper from the
trash-basket, and the page opposite the horse contained what Craig
described.

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

We shall note several other cases of this sort of intrusion of things I
did not draw, but which I had before me while drawing.

Also anything with metal or shine seems to stand a good chance of being
"got." For example, these nose-glasses ([figs. 49, 49a](#img_fig049).md):

<span id="img_fig049"></span> ![Fig. 49, Fig. 49a](img/fig049.jpg.md)

The comment reads: "Opalescent shine or gleam. Also peafowl."

Or again, a belt-buckle; my wife writes the word "shines" ([figs. 50,
50a](#img_fig050).md):

<span id="img_fig050"></span> ![Fig. 50, Fig. 50a](img/fig050.jpg.md)

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

Or this very busy alarm clock—she writes the same word "shines" ([figs.
51, 51a](#img_fig051).md):

<span id="img_fig051"></span> ![Fig. 51, Fig. 51a](img/fig051.jpg.md)

She has got at least part of a watch whenever one has been presented.
You remember the one Bob drew ([fig. 17](mrad08.htm#img_fig017).md). There
was another in series thirty-three; Craig made a crude drawing and
added: "Shines, glass or metal" ([figs. 52, 52a](#img_fig052).md):

<span id="img_fig052"></span> ![Fig. 52, Fig. 52a](img/fig052.jpg.md)

Also, on the automobile ride to Pasadena, series three, there was a
watch-face among the drawings, and Craig drew the angle of the hands,
and added the words, "a complication of small

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

configurations." Having arrived in Pasadena, she took the twelve
drawings and tried them over again. This time, of course, she had a one
in twelve chance of guessing the watch. She wrote: "A white translucent
glimmering, or shimmering which I knew was not light but rather glass.
It was like heat waves radiating in little round pools from a center. .
. . Then in the center I saw a vivid black mark. . . . So it was bound
to be the watch, and it was."

And here is a fountain. You see that it appears to be in a tub, and is
so drawn by Craig. But you note that the "shine" has been got. "These
shine!" ([figs. 53, 53a](#img_fig053).md):

<span id="img_fig053"></span> ![Fig. 53, Fig. 53a](img/fig053.jpg.md)

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

Another instance, even more vivid. I made a poor attempt to draw a bass
tuba, as one sees them on the stage—a lot of jazz musicians dressed up
in white duck, and a row of big brass and nickel horns, polished to
blind your eyes. See what Craig drew, and also what she wrote ([figs.
54, 54a](#img_fig054).md):

<span id="img_fig054"></span> ![Fig. 54, Fig 54a](img/fig054.jpg.md)  
Fig. 54, Fig 54a

The comments, continued on the other side of the sheet, are: "Dull gold
ring shimmers and stands out with shadow behind it and in center of it.
Gleams and moves. Metal. There is a glow of gold light, and the ring or
circle is out in the air, suspended, and moves in blur of gold."

You see, she gets the feeling, the emotional content. I draw a child's
express-wagon, and she writes: "Children again playing but can't get
exactly how they look. Just feel there are children." Or take this one,
which she describes as "Egyptian." I don't know if my pillar is real

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Egyptian, but it
seems so to me, and evidently to my wife, for you note all the artistry
it inspired ([figs. 55, 55a](#img_fig055).md):

<span id="img_fig055"></span> ![Fig. 55, Fig. 55a](img/fig055.jpg.md)

Sometimes Craig will embody the feeling in some new form of her own
invention; as for example, when I draw an old-fashioned cannon on
wheels, and she writes: "Black Napoleon hat and red military coat." I
draw a running fox —well drawn, because I copy it from a picture; she
rises to the occasion with two crossed guns, and a hunting horn with a
lot of musical notes coming out of it ([figs. 56, 56a](#img_fig056).md):

<span id="img_fig056"></span> ![Fig. 56, Fig. 56a](img/fig056.jpg.md)

I draw an auto, and she replies with the hub and spokes of a wheel. Not
satisfied with this,

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

she sets it aside, and tries again a little later—without looking at the
original drawing—and this time she produces a horn, with indication of a
noise. I give both her drawings, which are on two sides of the same slip
of paper ([figs. 57a, 57b](#img_fig057).md):
