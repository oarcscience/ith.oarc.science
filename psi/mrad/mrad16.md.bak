### XV

<span class="smallcaps">What</span> are the principles upon which I have
classified the drawings, as between successes, partial successes, and
failures? I will use this series, number eight, to illustrate. There are
eight drawings, and I have set them down as one success, six partial
successes, one failure. The success is the rooster ([fig.
61](mrad15.htm#img_fig061).md), called "a rooster," even though it "looks
like a coffee pot." The partial successes are, first, an electric light
bulb, very crudely imitated as to shape in three drawings. Perhaps this
was hardly good enough to be counted; it was a border-line case, and
probably the poorest that I admitted to the classification of "partial
successes" ([fig. 63a](#img_fig063).md).

Second, the ascending sky-rocket, already printed as [fig.
38](mrad13.htm#img_fig038.md), giving rise to six different drawings of
whirligigs and light. Third, the following drawing, for which Craig
wrote: "See spider, or some sort of legged pest. If this is

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

<span id="img_fig063"></span> ![Fig. 63a](img/fig063.jpg.md)

not a spider, there is a spider in the lot somewhere! This I know!"
([fig. 64](#img_fig064).md):

<span id="img_fig064"></span> ![Fig. 64'](img/fig064.jpg.md)

The fourth partial success was a drawn bow, with arrow fitted, ready to
be launched. Craig

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

wrote as follows: "Picked this up and saw inside as it dropped on
floor—so did not try it. Suddenly recall I have already 'seen' it
earlier." Before starting the tests, along with her written mention of
"a rooster," she had drawn a bow and crude arrow, and the resemblance is
so exact that it seems to me entitled to be called a partial success
([figs. 65, 65a](#img_fig065).md):

<span id="img_fig065"></span> ![Fig. 65, Fig. 65a](img/fig065.jpg.md)

Fifth, the wagon hub ([fig. 60](mrad15.htm#img_fig060).md), which became
the deer's muzzle. And finally the laced-up football ([fig.
15](mrad07.htm#img_fig015).md) which became a belly-band on a calf ([fig.
15a](mrad07.htm#img_fig015).md).

As for the failure in this series, it is a cake of soap, which was
called "whirls." There are a couple of other drawings in the series,
marked: "Too tired to see it," and "Tired now and excited and keep
seeing old things"—meaning, of course, the preceding drawings.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

I tried to avoid drawing the same object more than once, but now and
then I slipped up. In series eleven I drew another rooster, and there
followed, not one "anticipation," but several. Drawing number one was a
tooth; Craig wrote: "First see rooster. Then elephant." Drawing number
two was an elephant; and Craig wrote: "Elephant came again. I try to
suppress it, and see lines, and a spike sticking some way into
something." She drew it, and it seems clear that the "spike" is the
elephant's tusk, and the head of the "spike" is the elephant's eye
([figs. 66, 66a](#img_fig066).md):

<span id="img_fig066"></span> ![Fig. 66, Fig. 66a](img/fig066.jpg.md)

Next, number three, was the rooster. But Craig had set "rooster" down in
her mind as a blunder, so now she wrote: "I don't know what, see a
bunch, or tuft clearly. Also a crooked arm

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

on a body. But don't feel that I'm right." Here are the drawings, and
you can see that she was somewhat right ([figs. 67, 67a](#img_fig067).md):

<span id="img_fig067"></span> ![Fig. 67, Fig. 67a](img/fig067.jpg.md)

This series eleven, containing fourteen drawings, is marked: "Did this
lot rapidly, without holding (mind) blank. The chicken and elephant came
*at once*, on a very earnest request to my mind to 'come across.'" I
have classified in this series two successes, five partial, and five
failures: throwing out numbers twelve and fourteen, because Craig wrote:
"Nothing except all the preceding ones come—too many at once—all past
ones crowding in memory"; and again, "Nothing but everything in the
preceding. Too many of them in my mind."

The anticipations run all through this series in a quite fascinating
way. Thus, for number

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

four Craig wrote: "Flower. This is a very vivid one. Green spine—leaves
like century plant." She drew figure [68a](#img_fig068.md):

<span id="img_fig068"></span> ![Fig. 68a](img/fig068.jpg.md)

And then again, for drawing number seven, she did more flowers, with
this comment: "This is a *real* flower, I've seen it before. It's vivid
and returns. Century plant? Now it turns into candle stick. See a
candle" ([fig. 69a](#img_fig069).md).

All this was wrong—so far. Number four was a table, and number seven was
the rear half of a cow. But now we come to number eleven, the plant
known as a "cat-tail," which seems to resemble rather surprisingly the
lower of the two

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

<span id="img_fig069"></span> ![Fig. 69a](img/fig069.jpg.md)

drawings in figure [69a](#img_fig069.md). My drawing is given as figure
[70](#img_fig070.md), and the one Craig made for it is given as
[70a](#img_fig070.md).

<span id="img_fig070"></span> ![Fig. 70, Fig. 70a](img/fig070.jpg.md)

Comment on the above read: "Very pointed. Am not able to see what. Dog's
head?"

Drawing five was a large fish-hook; and this inspired the experimenter
to a discourse, as follows:

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Dog wagging—see
tail in air busy wagging—jolly doggie—tail curled in air." And then:
"Now I see a cow. I fear the elephant and chicken got me too sure of
animals. But I see these."

Now, a big fish-hook looks not unlike a "tail curled in air." But when
we come to number seven, we discover what Craig was apparently
anticipating. It is the drawing of what I have referred to as "the rear
half of a cow." It is badly done, with a cow's hoof, but I forgot what a
cow's tail is like, and this tail that I drew would fit much better on a
"jolly doggy," you must admit ([fig. 71](#img_fig071).md):

<span id="img_fig071"></span> ![Fig. 71](img/fig071.jpg.md)

Drawing number six was a sun, as children draw it, a circle with rays
going out all round. Craig wrote: "Setting sun and bird in sky. Big

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

bird on wing—seagull or wild goose." This I called a partial success.
Number nine was the muzzle end of an old-style cannon, already reported
in figs. [46, 46a](mrad14.htm#img_fig046.md).

I conclude the study of this particular series with drawing thirteen, to
which was added the comment: "Think of a saucer, then of a cup. It's
something in the kitchen. Too tired to see" ([figs. 72,
72a](#img_fig072).md):

<span id="img_fig072"></span> ![Fig. 72, Fig. 72a](img/fig072.jpg.md)

In series fourteen, drawing three, Craig wrote: "Man running, can't draw
it." She drew as follows ([fig. 73a](#img_fig073a).md):

<span id="img_fig073a"></span> ![Fig. 73a](img/fig073a.jpg.md)

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

Next came my drawing four, as follows ([fig. 73](#img_fig073).md):

<span id="img_fig073"></span> ![Fig. 73](img/fig073.jpg.md)

In series thirty-five I first drew a fire hydrant, and Craig wrote,
"Peafowl," and added the following drawing, which certainly constitutes
a partial success ([figs. 74, 74a](#img_fig074).md):

<span id="img_fig074"></span> ![Fig. 74, Fig. 74a](img/fig074.jpg.md)

My next drawing was the peafowl, as you see. For this Craig wrote:
"Peafowl again," and apparently

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

tried to draw the peafowl's neck, and a lot of those spots which I had
forgotten are an appurtenance of peafowls ([figs. 75,
75a](#img_fig075).md):

<span id="img_fig075"></span> ![Fig. 75, Fig. 75a](img/fig075.jpg.md)

In series twenty-nine I drew an elevated railway. If you turn it upside
down, as I have done here, it looks like water and smoke-stacks. Anyhow,
Craig drew a steamboat ([figs. 76, 76a](#img_fig076).md):

<span id="img_fig076"></span> ![Fig. 76, Fig. 76a](img/fig076.jpg.md)

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

And then came my next drawing—a steamboat! Craig wrote: "Smoke again,"
and drew the smoke and the stack ([figs. 77, 77](#img_fig077).md):

<span id="img_fig077"></span> ![Fig. 77, Fig. 77a](img/fig077.jpg.md)

She added two more drawings, which appear to be the wheel of the boat in
the water, and the smoke ([figs. 77b, 77c](#img_fig077b).md):

<span id="img_fig077b"></span> ![Fig. 77b, Fig. 77c](img/fig077b.jpg.md)

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

In series thirty I drew a fish-hook with line, and you see it turned
into a flower ([figs. 78, 78a](#img_fig078).md);

<span id="img_fig078"></span> ![Fig. 78, Fig. 78a](img/fig078.jpg.md)

Then came an obelisk, and Craig got it, but with novel effects, thus
([figs. 79, 79a](#img_fig079).md):

<span id="img_fig079"></span> ![Fig. 79, Fig. 79a](img/fig079.jpg.md)

Now why should an obelisk go on a jag, and have little circles at its
base? The answer appears to be: it inherited the curves from the
previous fish-hook, and the little circles from the next drawing. You
will see that, having used

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

up her supply of little circles, Craig did not get the next drawing so
well ([figs. 80, 80a](#img_fig080).md):

<span id="img_fig080"></span> ![Fig. 80 Fig. 80a](img/fig080.jpg.md)

In series twenty-two I first drew a bed, and Craig made two attempts to
draw a potted plant. My second drawing was a maltese cross, and Craig
turned it into a basket ([figs. 81, 81a](#img_fig081).md):

<span id="img_fig081"></span> ![Fig. 81 Fig. 81a](img/fig081.jpg.md)

But she could not give up her plant. She added: "There is a flower
basket in this lot, or potted plant." The next drawing was a
fleur-de-lys,

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

which looks not unlike a potted plant or hanging basket ([fig.
82](#img_fig082).md):

<span id="img_fig082"></span> ![Fig. 82](img/fig082.jpg.md)

In drawing four she got the elements of a door-knob pretty well, and
added: "See head of bird, too—eagle beak." Drawing seven was a crane,
with beak open.
