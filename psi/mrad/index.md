<span class="small">...I don't like to believe in telepathy, because I
don't know what to make of it... and I would a whole lot rather give all
my time to my muckraking...I don't expect to sell especially large
quantities of this book... In short, there isn't a thing in the world
that leads me to this act, except the conviction which has been forced
upon me that telepathy is real...--p. 229</span>

Upton Sinclair took a gamble publishing this book. A lifelong Socialist
who ran for high office several times, a muckraking author who had
exposed the abuses of capitalism, was dabbling with what was seen as the
occult. The impetus for this was his dear wife, Mary Craig Sinclair,
known as 'Craig,' who had been aware all her life that she could sense
things that had not yet happened, or which she had no rational access
to. In the late 1920s, this came to light when Craig had an odd feeling
that their friend Jack London was in mental turmoil, just prior to
London's suicide. The Sinclairs started to investigate how deep this
particular rabbit hole went...

The core of this book is a series of doodles which Upton and others made
outside Craig's presence, which she was able to duplicate, apparently
telepathically or through clairvoyance. Sinclair claims that Craig had
over a 75% success rate over 290 tests, including 25% matches, and 50%
partial matches. This success rate is obviously a lot higher than
probability, considering that the potential set of drawings is a lot
larger than, say, a deck of cards.

Sinclair's top reputation as a 'speaker of truth to power' was actually
a compelling reason to take this book seriously. The response to Mental
Radio was very positive, impressing academics in the field of psychology
and other scientists, including Albert Einstein, who wrote the
introduction to the German edition. William McDougal, Chair of the
Psychology Department at Duke University, who wrote the introduction for
this edition, conducted his own experiments with Craig. McDougal and
J.B. Rhine later went on to found the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke,
which conducted the [first academic investigations of
ESP](../esp/index.md). Walter Franklin Price, founder of the Boston Society
for Psychical Research, asked the Sinclairs if he could analyze their
research notes. In April 1932, Price published an analysis of the
Sinclair experiments in the Society's *Bulletin* in which he concluded
that the data could not be explained by coincidence or fraud.

*Production notes:* In order to effectively display the large number of
images in this book, I've embedded the images in each file, rather than
thumbnailing them as usual. This is possible because these images are
monochrome line drawings and smaller than an equivalent grey-scale file.
However, be aware that some of these chapters may take awhile to load on
a slow Internet connection.--<span class="small">*J.B. Hare, May 15,
