### VIII

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> experiments just described were all
that were done with Bob, because he found them a strain. Craig asked me
to make some drawings for her, and I did so, sitting in the next room,
some thirty feet away, but always behind a closed door. Thus you may
verify my assertion that the telepathic energy, whatever it may be,
knows no difference between thirty feet and forty miles. The results
with Bob and with myself were about the same.

The first drawings made with me are those which have already been given
([fig. 2, 2a](mrad03.htm#img_fig002).md), but I give them again for the
sake of convenience. I explain that in these particular drawings the
lines have been traced over in heavier pencil; the reason being that
Craig wanted a carbon copy, and went over the lines in order to make it.
This had the effect of making them heavier than they originally were,
and it made the whirly lines in Craig's first drawing more numerous than
they should be. She did this in the case of two or three of the early
drawings, wishing to

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

send a report to a friend. I pointed out to her how this would weaken
their value as evidence, so she never did it again.

<span id="img_06500"></span> ![](img/06500.jpg)

After my wife and I had compared the above drawings, she wrote a note to
the effect that just

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

before starting to concentrate, she had been looking at her drawing of
many concentric circles, which she had made in a test with Bob the
previous day ([fig. 19a](mrad08.htm#img_fig019).md). So her first vision
was of a whirl of circles. This turned sideways, and then took the shape
of an arrowhead, and then of a letter A, and finally evolved into a
complete star. As the agent in this test, I wish to repeat that I made
my drawing in my study with the door closed, that I kept it before my
eyes the entire time, and that the door stayed closed until Craig called
that she was through.

I do not find it easy to concentrate on a drawing, because my active
mind wanders off to side issues. If I draw a lighted cigarette, I
immediately think of the odious advertising now appearing in the papers;
or I think: "Will Craig get this right, and what does it mean, and will
the world accept evidence on this subject from me?"—and so on. Several
times my wife has "got" such thoughts, and so we took to noting them on
the record. On July 29, I drew a cigarette, with two little curls for
smoke, each running off like a string of the letter "eeeee," written by
hand. Underneath I wrote as follows: "My thought: 'cigarette with curls
of smoke.' I said to myself these words: 'she got the curls but not the
cigarette.'"

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

This would appear to be telepathy coming from Craig to me, for her
drawing was found to contain a lot of different curves—a curly capital
S, several other half circles twisted together, and three??? one inside
the other. She added the following words: "I can't draw it, but curls of
some sort."

Again, here is a work of art from my facile pen, dated July 21, and
having underneath my notation: "Concentrated on bald head" ([fig.
20](#img_fig020).md)

<span id="img_fig020"></span> ![Fig. 20](img/fig020.jpg.md)

My wife's note was: "Saw Upton's face." Then she drew a line through the
words, and wrote the following explanation: "Saw two half circles. Then
they came together making full circle. But I felt uncertain as to
whether they belonged together or not. Then suddenly saw Upton's profile
float across vision."

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

July 20 I drew a three-pronged fork, and made the note that I was not
sure if it was a hay-fork or an oyster-fork, and decided it was the
latter, whereupon my mind went off to "society" people and their many
kinds of forks. Craig wrote: "I thought it was an animal's head with
horns, and the head was on a long stick—a trophy mounted like this"—and
she drew a two-pronged fork.

July 17 I drew a large round stone with a smaller stone on top: at least
so I thought, and then decided they were two eggs. Craig drew two almost
tangent circles, and wrote: "I see two round things, not one inside the
other, as in Bob's drawing of circles. Then the above vanished and I saw
as below"—and she drew four little oblongs, tangent, which might be a
cluster of fish-eggs or fly-eggs.

July 20 I drew two heavy straight lines making a capital letter T, and
Craig drew a complete cross or square X, which is, of course, the T with
vertical arm prolonged. July 14 I drew a sort of jack-lantern. It is on
next page ([fig. 21](#img_fig021).md). I looked at this drawing and thought
of the eyes of M.C.S., and said mentally, "I should have drawn the
curves over eyes." Afterwards I told Craig about this, and she noted it
down on the drawing. On the reverse side of the sheet

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

<span id="img_fig021"></span> ![Fig. 21](img/fig021.jpg.md)

she added the following: "I told U. it was shaped like a half moon with
something in center—I supposed it must be a star, though I did not see
it as star but as indistinct marks." Her drawing follows, turned upside
down for greater convenience ([fig. 21a](#img_fig021a).md):
