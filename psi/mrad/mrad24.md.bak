### XXIII

<span class="smallcaps">Mention</span> telepathy in company, and almost
every one has a story to tell. You can find a clairvoyant to tell you
about yourself for a dollar—and maybe she is a fraud, but then again,
maybe she is a person with a gift which she does not understand, and the
police throw her into jail because they don't understand it either. I am
sorry if I aid the mass of fraud which I know exists in this field, but
there is no power of man which may not and will not be abused. The
person who invented high explosives and made possible great tunnels and
bridges, also made possible the destruction of the Louvain library. The
person who makes a dynamo may electrocute himself.

In spite of all fraud, I am convinced that there are thousands of
genuine clairvoyants and psychics. My friend Will Irwin told me recently
how he spent a year or so collecting material and writing an exposure of
fraud, "The Medium Game," published in *Collier's Weekly* some twenty
years ago. At the end of his labors he

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

went, on sudden impulse, into a "parlor" on Sixth Avenue, a cheap
neighborhood of New York, and a fat old woman in a greasy wrapper took
his dollar, and held his hand in hers, and told him things which he
believed were known to no human being but Will Irwin.

"What is the use of it?" some will ask. I reply with another question:
"What was the use of the lightning which Franklin brought down from the
clouds on his kite-string?" No use that Franklin ever knew; yet to-day
we make his lightning turn the wheels of industry, and move great
railroad systems, and light a hundred million homes, and spread jazz
music and cigarette advertising thousands of miles in every direction.
It is an axiom of the scientist that every scrap of knowledge will be
put to use sooner or later; get it, and let the uses wait. The discovery
of the cause of bubonic plague was made possible because some
foolish-minded entomologist had thought it worth-while to collect
information about the fleas which prey upon the bodies of rats and
ground squirrels.

I know a certain Wall Street operator who employed a "psychic" to sit in
at his business conferences, and tell him if the other fellow was
honest. I believe it didn't work very well; perhaps

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

the circumstances were not favorable to concentration. Needless to say,
Craig and I have no interest in such uses to be made of our knowledge.
What telepathy means to my wife is this: it seems to indicate a common
substratum of mind, underlying our individual minds, and which we can
learn to tap. Figure the conscious mind as a tree, and the subconscious
mind as the roots of that tree: then what of the earth in which the tree
grows, and from which it derives its sustenance? What currents run
through that earth, affecting all the trees of the forest? If one tree
falls, the earth is shaken—and may not the other trees feel the impulse?

In other words, we are apparently getting hints of a cosmic
consciousness, or cosmic unconsciousness: some kind of mind stuff which
is common to us all, and which we can bring into our individual
consciousness. Why is it not sensible to think that there may be a
universal mind-stuff, just as there is a universal body-stuff, of which
we are made, and to which we return?

When Craig orders her mind, or some portion of it, or faculty of it, to
get what is in Bob's mind, while Bob is forty miles away—and when her
mind does that, what are we to picture as happening? If I am correct in
my guess, that

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

mind and body are two aspects of one reality, then we shall find some
physical form of energy being manifested, just as we do when we
communicate by sound waves. The human brain is a storage battery,
capable of sending impulses over the nerves. Why may it not be capable
of sending impulses by means of some other medium, known or unknown? Why
may there not be such a thing as brain radio?

Certainly we know this, that every particle of energy in the universe
affects to some slight extent every other particle. The problem of
detecting such energy is merely one of getting a sufficiently sensitive
device. Who can say that our thoughts are not causing vibrations? Who
can set a limit to the distance they may travel, or to the receiving
powers of another brain, in some way or other attuned thereto? Any truly
scientific person will admit that this is a possibility, and that it is
purely a question of experimenting, to find out if it does happen, and
how.

Again, consider the problem of clairvoyance, suggested by Craig's
ability to tell what is inside a book she holds in her hand without
seeing it, or to reproduce drawings when no human mind knows what
drawing she holds. How are we to figure that as happening? Shall we say

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

that brain vibrations affect material things such as paper, and leave
impressions which endure for a long time, possibly forever? Can these
affect another brain, as in the case of a bit of radium giving off
emanations? It seems to me correct to say that, theoretically, it is
inevitable. Every particle of energy that has ever been manifested in
the universe goes on producing its effects somewhere, somehow, and the
universe is forever different because of that happening. The soil of
Britain is still shaking with the tramp of Cæsar's legions, two thousand
years old. Who can say that some day we may not have instruments
sensitive enough to detect such traces of energy? On the very day that I
am reading the galley proofs of this book, I find in my morning paper an
Associated Press dispatch, from which I clip a few paragraphs.

"A fundamental discovery in photography that takes the 'pictures'
directly on cold, hard untreated metal without the usual photographer's
medium of a sensitized plate was made public to-night at Cornell
University. It reveals that seemingly impervious metal records on its
surface unseen impressions from streams of electrons and that these
marks can be brought into visibility by the right kind of a 'developer,'

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

exactly as photographic images are brought out on sensitized paper. . .
.

"While studying sensitivity of photographic plates to electron rays it
suddenly was realized that polished metal surfaces might be able to pick
up impressions of these beams, and when tests were made they showed that
not only could such records be made on metals, but the amazing fact
appeared that some metals are almost as sensitive as photographic film,
and for very low velocity electrons much more sensitive. . . .

"This young physicist one day was looking at the rough spots produced on
the metal target of an X-ray tube by electron bombardment. Such spots
are commonplace, familiar sights to laboratory workers. It occurred to
Dr. Carr that perhaps long before the electrons produced the rough place
they made an invisible impression, which might be 'developed' in the
same manner that the still invisible image on a photo is brought out by
putting it into a developing bath. Carr shot the electron rays at gold
plates and developed them with mercury vapor, he shot them at silver and
developed with iodine, he used hydrochloric acid to develop zinc plates
and iodine to develop copper."

And now, if X-rays leave a permanent record

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

on metal, why might not brain-rays, or thought-rays, leave a record upon
a piece of paper? Why might not such energies be reflected back to
another brain, as light is reflected by a mirror? Or perhaps the record
might stay as some other form of energy, turned back into brain-rays or
thought-rays by the percipient. We are familiar with this in the
telephone, where sound vibrations are turned into electrical vibrations,
and in this form transported across a continent and under an ocean, and
then turned back into sound vibrations once again.

That mental activities do leave some kind of record on matter seems
certain; at any rate, it is the basic concept of the materialistic
psychologist. For what is memory, to the materialist, but some kind of
record upon brain cells? He compares these cells to photoelectric cells,
and imagines a lot of stored up records which we can consult. If now it
should be found that such memory records are impressed, not merely upon
living brain cells, but upon the molecules or electrons which compose
any form of matter, what would be so incredible about that?

I have gone this far, in the effort to meet my materialist friends
halfway. For my part, I have no metaphysics; I am content to say that

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I do not know what
matter is, nor what mind is, nor how they interact. If you want to
realize the inadequacies of the materialistic dogma, so far as concerns
this special field, you may consult the work of Dr. Rudolph Tischner, a
qualified scientist of Germany, whose book, "Telepathy and
Clairvoyance," is published in translation by Harcourt, Brace and
Company. The last chapter, called "Theory," deals with the suggested
explanations in more detail than I have the space for here.
