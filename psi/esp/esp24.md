### <span class="smallcaps">Second Appendix to Chapter 15</span> <span id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_103)

Throughout this report the values of groups of data have been presented
in the form X=D/p.e. In the beginning of the experiment this ratio was
important as a proof of the inadequacy of the chance hypothesis. When
the values grew far beyond the limits of any available tables the X
ratio was useful mainly as an arbitrary quantitative measure of
differences between blocks of data and between the work of individuals.
These X ratios may serve their original purpose as anti-chance ratios,
however, if any reader still clings to the Chance Hypothesis.

The following table ([Table XLIV](esp24.htm#an_tab44)) gives an
approximation to the meaning in terms of chance probability of the X
values listed in [Table XLIII](esp22.htm#an_tab43) \[10<sup>-14</sup>
means 1 fourteen places to the right of the decimal point
(.000 000 000 00001). This gives odds of 100 thousand billions to one
against mere chance as an explanation. It is left to the reader to write
out the figure corresponding to 10<sup>-1220</sup>.\]

The figures given are rough approximations computed by using only the
coefficient of the series expansion for the probability integral. <span

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

the error of such an approximation is less than the last term used in
the series, and as we have used only the first term, 1, the error in P
is equal to the figure given; that is, an error of 100%. This would be a
serious error in a pay envelope or cost estimate, but with these tiny
ratios it is negligible. For example: if X = 20 the approximation would
give P = 10<sup>-40.744</sup>, but with an error of 100% the actual
value of P may lie anywhere between 10<sup>-44.443</sup> and
10<sup>-∞</sup>. As we are here concerned with only the upper limit of
the error the difference between . (40 zeros)18 and . (40 zeros)36 is
considerably less than the errors introduced by our using only two and
three significant figures in the tabulation of the exponents. <span
id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105)

And a final word of warning to the mathematical enthusiast.
Mathematically the difference between X = 20 and, let us say, X = 40, is
enormous beyond our capacity to experience. For that reason, for the
purpose of evidence in opposition to a Chance Hypothesis the difference
is simply too superfluous to be appreciated. The higher values do give
the experimenter a quantitative measure of comparison and a feeling of
comfortable certainty, but the skeptic who refuses to be convinced by a
value of 15 or 20 will scarcely be moved by any mathematical treatment
of the data whatever.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_103"></span>[168:1](esp24.htm#fr_103) I am indebted to Mr.
Charles E. Stuart, Graduate Assistant in Psychology, for this Appendix,
as well as for much assistance in the earlier mathematics of the
production. He has been, as mathematician, assistant, and subject, an
extraordinarily useful and competent man.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[168:2](esp24.htm#fr_104) The formula is given
in Rietz, H. L.: *Handbook of Mathematical Statistics*. P. 15.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[169:1](esp24.htm#fr_105) This paragraph may be
regarded as primarily for [mathematicians](errata.htm#9) since it would
require much space to make it clear to the layman. It simply justifies
the approximation-method used in measuring the odds against chance
implied by a given X-value. Since few men have ever required such odds
for establishing belief in a principle, the tables are not available;
and the computation by more exact methods would be a burdensome—and a
uselessly burdensome—task.
