### CHAPTER 6

#### <span class="smallcaps">Charles E. Stuart</span>

Mr. Stuart rose to prominence as a subject after Linzmayer but as an
investigator he antedated Linzmayer's best work. The experiments made by
Stuart with other subjects have been reported in detail already in
Chapter IV and need not be repeated. In these tests he included some

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

trials of himself and was encouraged by these results to go on to an
extended series. It is of his own extra-sensory perception, then, that
we shall write in this chapter.

Stuart is now a graduate assistant in this Department of Psychology and
has been, through the years I have known him, one of the ablest students
within my acquaintance. His own experiments were, I believe, very
carefully conducted. He always impresses me as being very cautious and
responsible. I think no one of our Departmental group would have the
least hesitation in taking his report of his own unwitnessed experiments
in E.S.P.

Stuart is of Scotch-American stock, one of a pair of identical twins. He
has the capacity to be more positively suggestible than Linzmayer and
can go into good hypnotic trance. He is perhaps not quite so stably
integrated as Linzmayer; he is a little more imaginative, more emotional
and more expressive. He is somewhat more sociable and has a fairly
altruistic disposition. He is religious in an active but very liberal
way, and has a definite interest in art. He even does some work in two
different forms of fine arts and shows appreciation in several.

Although Stuart has had no definite psychic experiences, he has
occasional "intuitions" in small daily affairs that may well be
clairvoyant. His mother and aunt have had veridical psychic experiences;
in his mother's case there was a visual hallucination of a wounded
relative on the battlefield, correctly coinciding in time and detail so
far as knowledge went. The aunt has had veridical premonitory dreams.

Stuart was a subject for Dr. Lundholm and myself in the trance-telepathy
series. He scored, at that time, just a little above chance average,
about 20% above. And that is the rate also in his first 100 trials
witnessed by myself, exactly 20% above, which means an average of 6 hits
per 25 calls. The other 40 trials I have witnessed raised the average
for the whole 140 trials to 6.15 hits per 25. All the rest of his work
is unwitnessed but, since he does not on the whole rise beyond the level
of these witnessed results and since he is the responsible man he is, I
feel that we may unhesitatingly offer his work to the public as fully
endorsed.

Beginning in the autumn of 1931 and continuing through the school year,
Stuart ran the huge sum of 7,500 trials. Marvelous patience indeed!
These were not very high but, on account of the large number of trials,
they take on great mathematical significance. The ratio of the positive
deviation to the p.e. rises to 13.5 (and, if computed by sections, as is
fully legitimate in so long an experiment under necessarily changing
conditions, we get a still higher value, since the first 500 trials
alone give a value of X 13.3). The average per 25 for the 7,500 was
6.05. [Table XV](esp13.htm#an_tab15) will show these results in details
of 500's. In his procedure Stuart

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

held the cards behind him, cut the pack there at the start, and held
each card by the corner between thumb and finger, recording each call
when made and checking up after every 5 calls (and then reshuffling).

If the value of X is worked out from the separate values for sections of
500, which were all done on different days and to a certain extent
represent separate tests with always varying mental conditions, we get
for X the much increased figure of 18.14. This trouble is unnecessary,
however, for purposes of proof, since 13.5 is adequate beyond question.

The most remarkable feature of this table ([XV](esp13.htm#an_tab15)),
aside from its high significance in terms of X ("anti-chance value") is
the relatively gradual decline of the rate of scoring. Taken, however,
by 500's there is a peculiarly low drop in the 9th with a "comeback" for
the 10th to the 12th, followed by a drop again. Taken in larger groups
of 1500's the decline is steadier, the average per 25 being
respectively, 7.1, 6.1, 5.7, 5.9, 5.4. In 2500's the decline is a bit
more telescoped, but is clearly shown. The last 150 trials were slightly
below chance and, after discussing it with me, Stuart discontinued for a
time. We were interested in preserving his full capacity. He agreed with
me that his interest had declined somewhat.

During the summer of ’32 I wrote Stuart, asking him to try some more
E.S.P. work with the cards. His rate of scoring was found to be quite
good again, averaging 6.8 in 25 for 250 trials. He continued for the
summer, until 2,100 trials were made. These were about on the same
scoring level, averaging 6.9 per 25 trials. They alone have a value of
12.5 for the ratio of deviation to p.e.

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

But again the decline set in as before and, at the end of the 2,100,
Stuart's scoring had fallen down almost to chance average. This effect
can be shown best in the following table, [XVI](esp13.htm#an_tab16), in
which the data are grouped in 400's in order to spread the decline
effect out over more points.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The falling off of
the rate of scoring is apparently in the last 1000 trials; the first
1000 keep at a fair level. This second decline is much more abrupt than
the first, but the better scoring period is longer (in point of number
of trials) and more consistent scoring characterizes it.

Stuart introduced an interesting technique into the tests reported in
[Table XVI](esp13.htm#an_tab16). He began on July 21 to make 2 calls for
each card, one for "correct" and another that he thought was
"incorrect". The two records were appropriately labelled and kept
distinct. Pearce had been calling whole series with the deliberate
purpose of getting all incorrect. But he was afraid to complicate the
procedure by making both "correct" and "incorrect" calls on one card.
Stuart found no difficulty, and, as one would expect, in general, his
positive deviation on the High-Scoring and negative deviation on the
voluntary Low-Scoring are about equal. They likewise decline together at
about the same rate, as would naturally follow. Comparison of the two is
made in Table [XVII-A](esp13.htm#an_tab17a) with the data grouped in
400's for the purpose of comparing the decline.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The columns
showing the percentage of deviation from the np value (chance
expectation) bring the close similarity to a focus. Note also the
closeness of the various values for the totals in the 5th line.

Another interesting accomplishment of Stuart was his huge day's work of
July 21. He called 700 for high record and 600 for low. This is perhaps
not equal to 1300 scores for high record but it is a huge day's work
beyond doubt—the longest on our records; Zirkle is second with 950, and
Pearce comes third with 900, for straight record. No one seems to have
suffered, or have become fatigued especially. In all cases the scoring
was up to par, even to the last. This evidence is directly contrary to
the "fatigue-theory" as proposed by Miss Jephson. <span
id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73)

At present the most interesting phase of Stuart's work is his
development of P.T. scoring; *i.e.*, pure telepathy. He has only
relatively lately got started at it and he does it with just about the
same level of ability as he now shows on the P.C. work. (His late work
on the clairvoyance has, however, been low.) On the 500 trials of P.T.
he averaged 5.8 hits per 25. His regular B.T. trials, the 950 made since
the work of [Table XVII](esp13.htm#an_tab17a), gave only 5.7 hits per
25. This is quite naturally a most interesting comparison to follow up.

Stuart has tried D.T. clairvoyance but has not done it very successfully
as yet in all his 2100 trials; but, as just stated, in all of his work
he has been scoring low for nearly a year. In the 2100 trials the
average is only 5.3 per 25; and is not "significant" as yet—*i.e.*, is
not 4 times the p.e.—it is only about 2 times the p.e. But it shows the
same type of curve which we found in Linzmayer's D.T. data, and have
also found in the distribution of D.T. scoring by others; *i.e.*, a
curve showing greater frequency of successes as we approach either the
top or the bottom of the pack by 5's. His data are as follows, totalled
in number of hits in the order of 5's down through the D.T. pack: 40,
39, 36, 38, 49. He gets fewest near the center of the pack, as do
several of the others.

Stuart, too, shows a distinct operating curve, in waves of 5's. That is,
he tends to succeed better on the first and last of each 5 in his D.T.
work, a matter perhaps of habitual rhythm of attention, since he has
called over 10,000, 5 calls at a run. His totals of all the hits made in
1000 trials of D.T. work, obtained by superimposing the results by 5's
and totalling, then, for each ordinal in the 5, yield the following: 46,
37, 37, 31, 51. These 1000 trials are not selected; they happened to be
at hand and convenient. They show in total yield very little deviation
from chance, only 2 above, but are interesting for this internal
peculiarity, the distribution that produces the difference of 20 points
between the 4th and 5th calls. This

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

suggests a factor of internal motivation of the percipient—effort and
attention, probably.

We have reported now a total of 14,700 trials made by Stuart, which
represent great labor on his part and which also make a valuable
contribution to the subject. They alone give a value of 21.16 or, if we
correct for internal distribution in the large group, we get a value
that goes beyond 24. This is in itself much in excess of the requirement
for the thorough exclusion of the "chance" theory for these results.
Stuart's results alone, then, would be an adequate basis for the
dropping of the hypothesis of accidental or random distribution. They
are summarized in [Table XVII-B](esp13.htm#an_tab17b).
