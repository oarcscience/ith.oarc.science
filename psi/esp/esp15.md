### CHAPTER 8

#### <span class="smallcaps">Five Other Major Subjects</span>

It will be convenient to complete the presentation of the other five
principal subjects as something of a single unit of contribution, partly
in the interest of economizing space and partly because they have,
because of their relative newness, each one contributed fewer data than
the three already reported on, but chiefly because these subjects have
worked together a great deal and their data correlate well. One subject,
for

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

example, has acted as agent in telepathic work for each of the other
four, while some of them have reversed the arrangement with her and have
themselves cooperated.

All five of these subjects have been Duke students, and all are good,
normal, intelligent individuals, like the other major subjects, devoid
of any marked peculiarity of personality. Three are girls, and all five
subjects are between 20 and 25 years of age, all in good health.

All five subjects have shown some definite inclination toward artistic
interests. For one point, all of them are specially interested in music,
and all either play the piano or sing well. All are imaginative and have
been at some time given to extensive day-dreaming. All are quite
sociable and friendly, though two are relatively reserved in expression.
And, as almost of necessity follows, all five are more interested in
people than in things or causes.

All five of these subjects are what we may properly call religious in
interest and ideals, but none is at all orthodox. All five also have had
some "intuitional" or hallucinatory or clairvoyant experience, though
these vary widely. All three of the girls have had some sort of
hallucination in childhood in which they saw apparitions, heard voices,
heard steps or the like. But they do not regard these over-seriously.

The family histories of these subjects is of interest, on the point of
similarity of background. In all cases there is reported a near relative
with something parapsychological, if nothing more than "intuitional"
capacity. (In the popular sense, this usually means mildly clairvoyant.)
One subject states that her aunt has had various clairvoyant
experiences, another that her aunt (mother's sister) heard "voices",
while her mother had quite marked intuitional understanding of people.
One of the boys states that his father and father's father possessed
parapsychic ability, and the other boy related an incident that was
regarded as typical, in which his mother showed clairvoyant or
telepathic knowledge of a mishap that befell him.

All of the subjects are, I think, hypnotizable, though I have not gone
far into that state with the two boys. Both, at least, made definite
beginnings. One of the girls has done automatic writing and another has
demonstrated other automatic phenomena.

These subjects are all of the kind that one can easily work with—they
are highly co-operative; in part this may be because of genuine interest
in the phenomena themselves. All of them have a major interest in
psychology, the two graduates, Miss Sara Ownbey and Mr. George Zirkle,
being assistants in our Department. Miss May Frances Turner has about
completed her work for graduation, and Miss June Bailey is an

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

undergraduate. Mr. T. Coleman Cooper is an undergraduate, formerly of
Duke and now of Birmingham Southern.

In presenting the data in this chapter, I shall not give consideration
to the question of fraud or deception, since that has been perhaps
overdone in the earlier chapters. Not that all these results were
obtained without any precautions-some of them had the best of
conditions. But because it involves too much unnecessary duplication to
describe conditions repeatedly, and because we are beyond the question
of proof and are after the explanation and conditions. Besides these
points, the very experimental conditions here are often in themselves
incidentally the answer to the deception question, as well as
contributive to knowledge of the process, (*e.g.*, long distance
E.S.P.).

Altogether we have, from these five subjects alone, from less than a
year's work with them, 26,950 trials, which have been very fruitful in
scores as well as in general relationships. This is indicated by the
fact that the average per 25 for the 26,950 trials, including all
conditions, is 8.4 and the value of X, the "anti-chance" ratio of
deviation to p.e., is 81.9, higher than the whole 64,224 trials
heretofore made. Combined with these we now will have a total of 91,174
trials, with a combined X-value of 111.2. On this score figures can do
no more.

I shall begin the "carving" of the huge piece of work represented by
these 26,950 trials by trimming off a portion that for our purposes is
irrelevant. This consists of 2,625 trials in clairvoyance by Zirkle.
These are really preliminary trials, since Zirkle has not developed, as
yet, any measurable P.C. ability, although he is our best P.T. subject,
so far. It was due to a slight misunderstanding that he and the
assistant recorded this large item-before good evidence of his P.C.
ability is discovered. And, once recorded, we cannot ignore it in the
calculation of totals, averages, values of X, etc. But, for the
comparisons we want to make in the processes we are working with, we may
well exclude this block of results for the time being. This leaves
24,325 trials with a yield of successes totalling 8,499, an average of
8.7 per 25, and a value of X = 86.4. These may be compared with the
figures of the last paragraph.

Of these 24,325 trials, 10,275 are P.T., 7,925 are made with the B.T.
clairvoyant condition and the remaining 6,125 are D.T. clairvoyance.
Their averages per 25 run as follows: P.T. 9.6, B.T. 8.9 and D.T. 7.1.

The data of this group of subjects may again be split apart in a
direction that cuts across the tri-partite division into P.T., B.T. and
D.T. This is on the matter of witnessing. It is a matter of relative
unimportance here, because, with the exception of one subject, the
results are quite as

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

good when witnessed as when not. The P.T. data are all witnessed,
sometimes by the agent, when she was authorized as an assistant. [Table
XXVII](esp15.htm#an_tab27) will give the results on these points.

It will be seen that both with the B.T. and the D.T. the witnessed data
were lower in score, as shown in the last column. With the B.T. the
difference is not great enough to be important (0.5). With the D.T. it
is larger (1.7) and is entirely due here to one subject, Miss Ownbey,
who does very good D.T. work unwitnessed but drops with a witness
present. Her later work has, however, shown that she is getting over
this effect; her witnessed D.T. score has shown a value for X of 3.2,
with the best results latest. This is evidently an exaggerated case of
the phenomenon shown regularly by Pearce with visitors and reported in
[Table XIX](esp14.htm#an_tab19), Chapter 7. Miss Weckesser also had the
same effect of witnessing on her B.T.

The P.T. results bring the "witnessed" up above the "unwitnessed", if we
include them. This immunity from the disturbing effect of witnesses, if
we may so regard it, here in the higher P.T. results (which were all
witnessed) is probably due to the fact of the participation of the
witness in the agency of the experiments. It was noted by Lodge in his
early experiments in telepathy that witnesses were not as disturbing if
they participated, a matter possibly explainable on the grounds that a
witness engaged cooperatively has his own attention engaged by his task,
and consequently does not contribute so much to the percipient's
self-consciousness and consequent inability to attend extra-sensorially.

Other points of interest in [Table XXVII](esp15.htm#an_tab27) are the
relatively similar averages-per-25 of the B.T. and P.T. data, in spite
of the fact that the phenomenal scoring of Zirkle in P.T. raised that
average considerably.

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (And Zirkle has
shown no B.T. ability as yet.) This is the largest group comparison we
have yet made on P.T. and B.T. There are 10,275 trials in the one and
7,925 in the other, with averages per 25, respectively, of 9.6 and 8.9.

Another point of importance is the D.T. scoring and totals. This is the
largest D.T. block of data yet offered and, while it is vastly
significant mathematically, it is much below the B.T. It runs, however,
at almost exactly the level that Pearce ran at, with about the same
ratio to the B.T. scores. Yet these subjects did not know Pearce's
averages, or even each other's and their own. Are we up against a
physical barrier or a psychical or parapsychical limitation in D.T.?

It will be remembered that the subjects whose D.T. work has been
reported earlier all showed a rate-of-scoring curve that fell to its
lowest point somewhere in the 15 cards of the center of the pack and
rose again with approach to the top and bottom. (Cooper's work in D.T.,
done later, gave the same sort of U-curve.) But Miss Ownbey's data on
the 3,350 trials at D.T., for which I have the detailed data in hand,
show just the opposite type of curve. Miss Ownbey gets more hits in the
center-3 of the untouched pack than in any other 5. Next come the two
adjacent 5's. Not only is this true of the totals but, when divided into
the two main periods in which they were run, they show the same curve in
the relation of the serial 5's in the pack. The details can be better
presented in the later chapters (chapters 10, 12 and 14; for these data
see Graphs [1](esp17.htm#img_gr01) and ) summarizing the "curve data"
but the gross results of totals by order of 5's in the pack are as
follows: 210, 226, 248, 230, 211. Suffice it here merely to point out
this reversal of the thought that was already taking shape in our minds,
that somehow there was regular difficulty experienced in the center of
the pack, possibly due to some physical obstruction. This hypothesis for
the lower D.T. scores was incapacitated by Miss Ownbey's D.T. data.

And Miss Ownbey's results help to explain why the other D.T. scores are
lower than the B.T. It has seemed probable that the difficulty of
scoring in the center of the pack held the total score for the run at
its relatively low level. On this basis, those who score at a level of
around 10 in 25 at B.T. would do little over 7 per 25 at D.T. Pearce is
a good example of this. Now, Miss Ownbey gets better results in the
interior and she scores the highest in D.T. work of all the subjects,
once reaching 20 in 25 in one run and averaging 8.4 in 25 over a range
of 3,275 trials. It would appear that D.T. scoring is as high as the
B.T. for those portions of the pack which are favored by the subject—the
central 5 by Miss Ownbey, and the first and last 5's by others. What
governs these curves—if not the expectation of the subject?

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

There is the further point to be added that the regularity of this D.T.
curve of Miss Ownbey (for both sub-divisions of her D.T. results) and
its unexpectedness are further testimony to the genuineness of the data,
for any who may have doubted on this point. That is, even had Miss
Ownbey known what shape of curve to expect (which she did not), she
would not likely have so regularly differed from what she would
naturally suppose we might be expecting.

To provide a basis for further discussion and comparison, [Table
XXVIII](esp15.htm#an_tab28) offers all the data for each subject, under
the different conditions, P.T., B.T. or D.T., and witnessed or not
witnessed, merely stating number of trials and average per 25. I exclude
again here the 2,625 practise trials on B.T. and D.T. by Zirkle, who has
shown no ability in these phases of E.S.P. All the special experiments
are included, however, regardless of their effect on the score.

A number of individual peculiarities appear in the table and others
still escape this very general summary of the evidence. Miss Ownbey is,
as mentioned above, our best D.T. subject if we take her unwitnessed
records, as I am fully prepared to do, but she has done very little
P.T., B.T. or witnessed D.T. work. Yet on all of these she has shown
good promise of success. She has been so good an agent in P.T. work that
her other work has been neglected.

Zirkle is the best P.T. man by far, but he has not been able to develop
B.T. or D.T., though he has tried a great deal. Cooper has not tried
D.T. work as yet. <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78) He was kept
concentrated on B.T. and P.T. comparison work, to be reported later.

The other two subjects, Misses Bailey and Turner, are pretty well
balanced between B.T. and P.T. and though they are still low on D.T.,
they are able to do it with some success.

On the P.T., where all five may be compared, there is pretty general
similarity, ranging only over 8.1 to 10.7 in the averages. And on B.T.
the four who can score well do it about equally well, ranging over much
the same averages as in the P.T. It will be of much interest indeed to
see if,

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

in the future, Zirkle can qualify on B.T. <span
id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79) Such results suggest some general level, a
sort of *species level* for E.S.P., which level ranges from 8 to 11
approximately, under normally good conditions.

The B.T. and P.T. comparisons justify, I think, another rearrangement of
these data in [Table XXIX](esp15.htm#an_tab29) for the first four
subjects, totalling and averaging the witnessed and unwitnessed data for
the purpose. Note, however, back in [Table XXVIII](esp15.htm#an_tab28)
that the witnessed B.T., which are among the latest performed and should
be the more comparable to P.T. because made during the period of P.T.
experiments, are, in the main, strikingly similar to them. The widest
difference between a subject's B.T. (witnessed) average and his P.T. is
1.0, and with 2 of the subjects the difference is only 0.2. This is very
meaningful on the point of interrelationship of the functions concerned
in telepathy and clairvoyance. Could such a series be mere coincidence?
But, because of the relatively small number of witnessed trials, we will
include in Table XXIX also the unwitnessed, even though they widen the
gap considerably.

This table brings out more comparable groups of data from the point of
number of trials, and brings Miss Turner's data on B.T. and P.T. to an
almost identical average, though we have widened differences between the
results of Misses Bailey and Ownbey for the two conditions. But the
totals of these four subjects for the two conditions come out most
remarkably similar, 8.9 and 8.5. With only a difference of .3, we have
no significant distinction between the two conditions for these subjects
and the results. In a later chapter all the data on this point, from all
subjects, will be mustered-with even greater coincidence resulting.

We had an opportunity to compare the daily fluctuations of one of these
subjects, Mr. Cooper, on both B.T. and P.T. They show, as did Mr.
Pearce's results under similar conditions, a very general agreement as
to direction of change from day to day. With but two exceptions, both
B.T. and P.T. rise and fall together. See [Table
XXX](esp15.htm#an_tab30). In one of these cases, the P.T. dropped to
chance because the laboratory was very hot

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Temperature around
100° F.) and the electric fan which was used on every other day of the
series was not obtainable. (One is moved to remark that the
once-much-talked-of "involuntary whispering" had its one really superb
opportunity to help out on this, the only day when the fan was not
available. Its failure to work we shall have to leave to its advocates
to explain, if any of these are left.) The B.T. of this day was done
under the regular conditions. Due to this difference in conditions, I
put the figures for this day, accordingly, in parenthesis. The reader
can judge them as he prefers. In the other exception the case is a clear
one for those who understand the workings of this mode of perception;
the point is, there is no value to including, for comparative purposes,
data not above chance. On the day in question here, Cooper started off
in his P.T. with only chance results for the first three runs, getting
6, 4, 4. Then after trying some special distance tests, not included in
this table, he returned to plain P. T. and got 8 in 25. After another
digression to other tests, he came back with 11, 11 in P.T. If we
include the calls when he obviously did not show any E.S.P. ability, it
makes an average per 25 of 7.3; but this defeats our purpose-to discover
the daily level of P.T. and B.T. scoring, *when conditions are right for
E.S.P. to function*. I feel, therefore, that most readers will approve
my taking the above-chance scores 8, 11, 11 for the data for comparison
for the P.T. of that day with the B.T. of that day. This is not a point
of evidence for E.S.P. or the case would be different. I set the gross
average 7.3 in parenthesis and the restricted average 10, without. Other
days, too, show a low start-off; it is rather the rule. But all the
others gave a quicker rise to good scoring; some special difficulty was
present here.

Allowing the corrections made, we have here another good case of joint
daily fluctuations in B.T. and P.T.—somewhat better, in fact, than
Pearce's. Note the relative agreement of the average per 25 of the
totals for B.T. and P.T., again differing by the small figure of 1.1.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

I do not have the data for a daily comparison of B.T. and P.T. on the
other subjects, except for Zirkle, and his B.T. has not yet risen above
chance average.

Turning from the point of comparison of natural scoring levels of the
subjects to factors that influence these, we find that P.T., as well as
B.T., is affected by sodium amytal, by caffeine, by illness (so far as
we have data), and by sleepiness and general fatigue. The evidence on
the last two points is merely incidental but on the first two is
experimental. It is not adequate on the last point, since in most cases
the testimony of the subject to his fatigue and sleepiness came after
the work was begun and he had already registered low scores. I accept
these judgments, myself, since I follow the work and know the subjects
very well, and can check up on such judgments to some extent, but I do
not ask the reader to accept them. But the similarity of this condition
of sleepiness to the effect of sodium amytal, and the similarity of
results may help the reader to accept the fragmentary data on the point.

I have noted the disturbance to scoring of sleepiness and general
fatigue on Linzmayer and Pearce on clairvoyance, and on telepathy
between Miss Ownbey and Zirkle. Selecting only the data from the two
last named where I am certain, myself, of the correctness of the
judgment, I will make a small table, [XXXI](esp15.htm#an_tab31), showing
the results taken before and after the period of sleepiness and fatigue
in P.T. work, with Zirkle as percipient. On the first day reported on
here, I myself saw Zirkle, and he told me, before beginning to work,
that he had been up all night and had had only three hours of sleep in
the morning. He said he did not especially want to sleep but was "sort
of groggy". The second occasion reported was one on which both Zirkle
and Miss Ownbey had returned late at night from a walk of about four
miles into the country. We have the complication here that the agent,
too, was tired. An equal number of the trials, last preceding and the
same number of those next succeeding the period of sleepiness, are shown
under general columns marked "Before" and "After".

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> These data are
supported by the strong general "clinical impression" I have that, on
the whole, both P.C. and P.T. work succeed best when the

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

subject is least tired and sleepy. In this way the results from the
effects of caffeine can best be harmonized and explained. This drug
improves scoring when it falls off, and makes the subject more alert and
integrated at the same time.

On the point of illness, too, the data are fragmentary and none too
adequate, but they support the already mentioned observations made on
Pearce. Miss Turner had a mild illness, a sort of general run-down
condition, with a temperature rise that led the physician to suggest her
staying in bed. She tried B.T. work under these conditions, but said she
felt unable to do it well and, since the tentative trials were poor, she
discontinued. She tried again several times, since she was rather bored,
but did not get the feeling of success, and, since she did not get up to
her usual good scoring level, she did not run for record and we thus
lost the opportunity to measure the effect of illness. However, on her
return to class, but before she was fully well, she was asked to try for
record and made two runs of 25 in my presence, with results of 5 and 4.
We stopped here because she did not like to score low and we thought the
effect might be bad on the process. Miss Turner does not require an
"adjustment period" at the start; so this question is ruled out. On the
last preceding occasion of my witnessing (also, the last preceding B.T.
she had done) she had made 2 runs, yielding 10 and 8; and next before
these, 5 runs averaging 10.2 in 25. We have no follow-up data, since the
experiments were interrupted for two months thereafter. Her general B.T.
average for 3,825 trials is 9.0. These fragments agree with Pearce's
B.T. data on the point of illness. We have, too, some illness data with
a similar bearing on the P.T. phase, obtained with Zirkle and with Miss
Ownbey as agent. We can best state them, along with Miss Turner's few
data, as a small table, [XXXII](esp15.htm#an_tab32). In this period of
illness we have the complicating circumstance that both agent and
percipient were indisposed. Further data, of course, will be required to
discriminate between the relative effect upon the two. We offer these
results for what they may mean as they are, with only the assurance that
the percipient was ill for a time before the agent and the drop came at
once with his indisposition. The illness was tonsilitis with Zirkle and
a general cold with Miss Ownbey. It lasted approximately 9 days,
affecting the results from July 12 to the 20th, inclusive.

The drop of Miss Turner was a drop of 9.9 less 4.5, or 5.4, and for Mr.
Zirkle from an average of (from data before and after) 14.9 to one of
8.6 during the period of illness. This is a drop of 6.3 per 25, a highly
significant value, and it leaves little question that, directly or
indirectly, such illness is a condition very inhibitory to E.S.P.

More striking still are the drug data obtained by Zirkle with Miss
Ownbey as agent and observer. The experiments with caffeine on the
telepathic phase here showed, as did those with the effect of caffeine
upon clairvoyance with Pearce, that caffeine helped the subject to
recover his normal E.S.P. scoring level when he was low, *i.e.*, it
helped to overcome disturbing (disintegrative) factors. But, as with
P.C. work, we have no data on the P.T. with caffeine that shows that it
enhances the actual E.S.P. function itself; it seems rather that it
merely helps it to function better through counteracting the inhibiting
elements, as seemed the case with the B.T. experiment. Again, like
caffeine and B.T. with Pearce, the drug did not raise the P.T. score
even to its highest level but, rather, to approximately the normal
average level. Zirkle's level for his period of good health is 14.8 in
25, P.T. and the average per 25 with caffeine for 300 trials was 14.7.
Now, Zirkle's highest score for a long series was 17.4 per 25 on an
average, for 300 trials without drugs and all made in one day, as were
the caffeine trials. So far as we understand the known psychological
effects of caffeine on recognized processes, this is what we would
expect; namely, a general integrative effect, overcoming dissociated
states, but not directly strengthening a special ability or raising its
specific efficiency. We were especially interested, therefore, in the
results from giving caffeine to Zirkle some time after sodium amytal.
This brings out sharply and experimentally the expected effects of both
drugs on the general mental organization, thus relating E.S.P. all the
more closely to the general functioning of mind.

It was planned with Miss Ownbey to give Zirkle sodium amytal and to take
his scoring level one hour later, over a range of 300 trials. As a
matter of fact, the level was also taken three hours after the drug
treatment. Then, according to plan, with the subject in this very
dissociated condition, he was treated with caffeine. The purpose was to
put the general principle of the role of caffeine in known processes to
test on this particular process (E.S.P.); and, in an anticipatory word,
it worked quite as might have been expected for any cognitive function
of mind.

In both the caffeine and amytal experiments 5 grain capsules were used,
both drugs being made up to look alike, and the subject was given no
notion of the drug to be used for a given occasion and did not know what
to expect from either one by way of effect on the P.T. ability. Miss

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ownbey knew which
drug was used but did not know what to expect in score effects.

After a level of 13.6 per 25 trials for the last preceding 250 trials
over the day preceding and after 2 runs averaging 13.5 hits in 25 on the
same day, a 5 gr. capsule of sodium amytal was taken by Zirkle (Pearce
had taken 6 gr.; Linzmayer 15) and one hour later testing was resumed.
By this time he was showing signs of sleepiness. He became very sleepy
during the course of the experiment, which took about 1/2 to 2 hours. He
wanted to lie down, felt a little dizzy on rising, occasionally wanted
to pause, but seemed rationally clear when questioned and could walk in
a straight line. If the experimenter left him alone a few minutes he
dropped asleep.

The conditions of the experiments were these: the regular P.T.
conditions were used, with the 5-symbols taken from the Zener cards, and
the telegraph key was used for signalling readiness by the agent. The
agent chose a systematized scheme of variation from series to series and
used no objective basis (cards, etc.), except the scoring record made of
the calls of the percipient. These were checked for correctness as the
call was recorded. The agent and percipient were in different rooms, out
of sight of each other but with the door open, with an electric fan
going (for comfort and "covering noise" combined). The percipient sat or
lay with eyes closed, back toward the agent's room. A distance of about
8 to 12 feet separated the two. The key tapping was monotonously uniform
to my ear and judgment. All the data of the table,
[XXXIII](esp15.htm#an_tab33), are from these conditions. In brief
summary, the score average per 25 dropped from 13.6 for the preceding
runs down to 7.8 for the series of 12 runs (300 trials); this is a drop
of 5.8 and is very significant mathematically. Like Pearce (and his B.T.
data) under the influence of the same drug and a similar amount, the
fluctuations are large, due, I think, to varying effort at "pulling
himself together" and its effect on attention. The scores per 25 runs
are as follows: 7, 8, 10, 4, 6, 10, 11, 10, 11, 8, 6, 3. Total 94.
Average per 25, 7.8. It is interesting to see that Zirkle dropped from
his average level (for period of good health) of 14.8 by a percentage
roughly similar to what Pearce did on B.T. under the influence of the
same drug; namely, a drop of 47% from the upper score level as compared
to 39% for Pearce.

Three hours after the drug was taken Zirkle was very, very sleepy
indeed. Sensory perception, which had not been disturbed during the
earlier runs, was now beginning to suffer slightly from illusion. A
piece of chalk lying a few feet (3 to 6) away appeared to be another
capsule. If a book was held close, he saw "double", but he could still
read without trouble and, with effort, walk straight. His recall of
recent events was impaired. In this condition 12 runs of P.T., under the
same conditions

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

yielded only an average score per 25 of 6.2, with nothing higher than 9.
These scores run as follows: 5, 5, 6, 9, 7, 4, 5, 5, 8, 7, 5, 8. Total
74; average per 25, 6.2. This is a drop of 8.6 from Zirkle's pre-drug
level of 14.8.

Now, of course, was the superb opportunity to test the effect of
caffeine's integrative influence upon this P.T. scoring. Would it work
just as it does upon any complex mental ability or skill; *i.e.*, would
E.S.P. rise with the re-achievement of self-control and capacity for
attention? Our other data had suggested that it would—and it did! It
rose from the level of 6.2 per 25, passed the older amytal level of 7.8
in 25, which had been reached one hour after taking the amytal, and
attained the fairly respectable score average of 9.5 in 25. This was now
5 hours after the 5 gr. dose of sodium amytal and one hour after a 5 gr.
dose of caffeine. The 300 trials yielded the following scores, varying
rather widely: 10, 8, 4, 6, 13, 11, 8, 13, 8, 11, 9, 13. Total 114, an
average per 25 of 9.5. During this experiment Zirkle was still sleepy
but the effect of the caffeine was clearly noticeable in his general
behavior. He had become somewhat more alert and poised, but was by no
means fully "normal" yet. He seemed much like his score average of 9.5
indicated—approximately "half-way normal". Two to three hours later,
however, he reported that he was fully recovered.

Still more data would have been interesting as the effect of the
caffeine increased and Zirkle became much more alert. But he had already
run 950 trials in one day and was leaving the next morning; and human
endurance and patience ought not to be asked for more than this. Also,
Miss Ownbey's work on this day alone deserves the highest comment. The
agent's duty is often the more exhausting by far, as Lodge early pointed
out. <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80) And these data alone are highly
significant, the conditions good and suggestion ruled out by the
disguise of the drugs. On these points of physiological changes, too,
then, the P.T. phase of E.S.P. responds in about the same degree and in
the same way as the B.T., and falls and rises with the degree of
disintegration of the nervous system. The summary of the drug
experiments with Zirkle appears in [Table XXXIII](esp15.htm#an_tab33).
The percentage of drop that followed taking the amytal is computed in
the text from the general average of 14.8 and in the table from the
average of the preceding interval 13.6, based on 250 trials. There are
points in favor of both and the data are significant enough that it does
not matter which level is used. In a final word, the results show that
both the disintegrating and integrating drugs seriously affect the
process of E.S.P. under P.T. conditions as much, in fact, as under B.T.
The condition of the

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

nervous system, then, is important in both. E.S.P. is pretty well
indicated to be a nervous phenomenon, in both phases or conditions, P.T.
and B.T.

One of the minor features of our pure telepathy work is the greater
tendency to fatigue on the part of the agent than of the percipient, as
it appeared at first. In working with Miss Bailey in a most remarkable
series, from room to room, Miss Ownbey, the agent, reported headache and
general fatigue. She reported fatigue more than once with other subjects
as well, particularly with Mr. Zirkle, with whom she did the most of her
P.T. work. The headache effect was stopped by hypnotic suggestion and,
although she has served as agent in several thousand trials since, she
no longer experiences this discomfort. But the fatigue effect was not
included in the suggestion treatment and continued for a time. Then it
declined with experience, until at length she was able to work without
special fatigue and even to participate in the long series of 950 trials
in one day. It seems probable that more strain goes with the stronger
effort, combined with the greater uncertainty of success in the earlier
trials, and that such strain, if prolonged, may cause headache perhaps
and fatigue certainly. But it is doubtful if the calm, more experienced
agent, who has grown into a confidence in her ability, need be
especially fatigued or indisposed. I have earlier referred to Lodge's
observation of this effect on the agent. I think the above explanation
may be applicable to his case also.

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

There seems to be a great difference in the ability of the agents we
have used. Our data are not conclusive on this point, because there are,
as usual in this work, other factors to consider. The fact that a P.T.
percipient does well with one and poorly with another agent may mean
merely that the one personality is less disturbing and straining than
the other; or more interesting or more suggestive and impressive; or
perhaps there may be many different features involved. We know that even
in B.T. work subjects have preferences as to whom they wish present and
that scoring is much affected by such attitudes. (See [Table
XIX](esp14.htm#an_tab19) on effect of visitors, B.T., Pearce.) We would
expect some such effect on P.T. also from the presence of different
agents. One point of fact, however, in this connection is that most
subjects do better with certain agents than with others. For example,
Zirkle did very well at once with Miss Ownbey, his fiancée. But he had
been tried earlier by another friend, also an assistant in this work,
with a very much smaller positive deviation from chance average. Pearce,
it will be remembered, did his best P.T. with young lady agents. But we
come, in the P.T. work of Cooper, to a sharper comparison between the
agency of two young ladies, Miss Margaret Parsons <span
id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81) and Miss Ownbey, in whom the factor of the
social interest of the percipient is fairly equalized but who differ in
a very important way. Miss Ownbey has well demonstrated her E.S.P.
ability in both the P.C. and P.T. phases. Miss Parsons has tried
patiently and nobly, but has not yet scored very successfully.

We have a very similar situation with Miss Bailey's P.T. work, with Miss
Beaven and Miss Ownbey as agents. Miss Beaven has not demonstrated
marked E.S.P. ability as yet, while Miss Ownbey has. Miss Ownbey, Miss
Bailey and Miss Turner, our three highest scoring girls, are also our
best agents. Can it be that the E.S.P. ability helps in the agency also?
This remains to be better studied. Often the agent seems to perceive
telepathically what the percipient "wants to call next", but, in order
to insure its being a one-way process, we adhere pretty closely to the
policy of having the agent devise mentally a system of sequence of the
images to be chosen and to alter the scheme every 5 calls. But the facts
seem strongly to suggest that agents not only differ at their end of the
function but also that it may be E.S.P. ability that makes a good agent.
This is only suggested, however. The fact that Stuart, with his fair
E.S.P. ability, did better in his early trance-telepathy work than I,
with almost no significant E.S.P. ability, did, is also in line. For a
summary of the data on comparison of agents in the P.T. work of this
chapter, see [Table XXXIV](esp15.htm#an_tab34).

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

The names in the heavier type represent agents who have been good
subjects and the rest, with only exceptions noted, have not yet
qualified. The name of Mr. Stuart is not in heavy type because he was,
during the period in which these tests were made, running very low,
close to chance average, on his other E.S.P. work. The total of the data
taken with agents whose names are emphasized is 2,350, with an average
per 25 yield of 10.7, whereas the remaining 1,525 yield an average per
25 of only 6.4. The very significant difference of 4.3 suggests that the
agent is important and that E.S.P. capacity may be one of the important
features.

But however much we may find (in the future) that E.S.P. ability may
help in P.T. agency as well as on the side of perception, it is
apparently not an equally reversible process. That is, the agent cannot
turn percipient and receive from the former percipient with success
equal to that of the original arrangement, so far as our results go.
When Cooper tried to send back to Miss Parsons, after successfully
"receiving" from her for 800 trials, the score was not above chance
average. When Zirkle and Miss Ownbey work with Zirkle receiving, the
normal average is 14.8, but with Miss Ownbey receiving it falls to 8.1.
If we take, in order to have similar conditions, Zirkle's first 300 for
comparison with Miss Ownbey's 300 trials with him as agent, we have 11.8
for him as percipient and 8.1 for her—still a significant difference,
3.7 for 15 runs. We have a few data, however, to suggest that when we
have agents and percipients equal in E.S.P. ability they can reverse the
P.T. process without great difference. For example, with Miss Bailey as
agent, Miss Turner got an average per 25 of 11.2 from 125 trials, and
with the reverse arrangement for 50 trials, Miss Bailey got 10 per 25.
Reversals between Miss Ownbey and Miss Turner differ in average per 25
by 2.1, but the number of trials are too

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

small for significance. These interesting but inadequate results are
summarized in [Table XXXV](esp15.htm#an_tab35).

Of the data in [Table XXXV](esp15.htm#an_tab35), those of Miss Ownbey
and Mr. Zirkle alone are significant and they are clearly so. Those of
Cooper are somewhat impressive because of the supporting fact that Miss
Parsons shows as yet no clear E.S.P. ability. While it is dangerous to
speculate on this table, it is safe, I think, to suggest that the
differences between percipients are brought out here, while in the last
preceding table the differences between agents were shown. The three
girls in the last two items of the table (3 and 4) are very much on a
par in E.S.P. ability and reversing makes very little difference. In
Zirkle's case, he is our highest scorer on P.T. and the reversal with
him brings a drop. With Cooper and Miss Parsons the contrast is even
greater, since her E.S.P. ability is very low. Combining the data of the
two tables, it appears: (1) that good E.S.P. ability in both agent and
percipient means high scoring (as shown by Miss Ownbey as agent for all
four percipients, who all have good E.S.P. ability); (2) that good
E.S.P. in a percipient, with low E.S.P. capacity in the agent, means
mediocre scoring (Cooper with Miss Parsons as agent, 6.5; Miss Bailey
with Miss Beaven, 6.8; Zirkle with Stuart during his low period, 6.7;
and others); (3) that with a percipient with low E.S.P. ability and an
agent with good E.S.P. ability the scoring will be bad, or will be
limited according to the ability of the percipient. (Miss Parsons as
percipient, with no demonstrated E.S.P., and Cooper as agent; and the
lower scoring of Miss Ownbey when she and Zirkle reversed, supports the
point of the E.S.P. capacity of the percipient being the more limiting
factor.) These three situations have been illustrated and to some extent
demonstrated, though not adequately. The third situation is the weakest
in data but it is strong in my own conviction. That is, there have been
incidents that support the point aside from the regular data. Often some
one helping,

</span>

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

as agent has playfully tried to obtain a reversal of direction of the
transfer of thought, perhaps for a few trials or not for serious record;
and the general impression has thus grown up in my mind that, as the
above data suggest, a good agent (as measured by his own general E.S.P.
record) cannot succeed in transferring thought to a "percipient" who (as
shown by the general evidence of the tests) has shown no E.S.P. capacity
or cannot go beyond the ability level shown. In a word, the percipient
seems to be the more limiting factor but is in turn limited by agents
who are poor in E.S.P. capacity. This hypothesis will be further tested
out in future work.

In turning finally to telepathy-at-a-distance we come up first against
the question of the effect of the mental attitudes of the percipient.
This is a question that concerns many of the experiments and will be
raised by many readers. If the percipient thinks a new experiment will
not work, it probably will not. If he suggests it and believes in it, it
has then a much better chance. Such is the general impression I have
received and for observations that support this I refer to the effect of
new techniques as summed up on one subject, Mr. Pearce, [Table
XX](esp14.htm#an_tab20). Therefore, when we came to the drug experiments
with Zirkle, it was decided to keep him ignorant of the drug taken and
of its probable effect on his record. And when we were trying first to
separate out a possible telepathic factor by looking at the cards for
one series and not looking for the next, a screen was used to keep
Pearce from knowing the condition used at a given time. And so on.

But it is difficult to test P.T. at a distance from the agent, and avoid
the factors of suggestion and expectation, without practising deception.
And it is hard for anyone to expect as good chances for success at a
distance as in the same room. Most of our first "distance P.T." was
handicapped, then, with an "inhibiting idea" that it would not work as
well. It certainly did not. As will be recalled from Pearce's data
([Table XXIV](esp14.htm#an_tab24)), significant results were had with
short distances of from 8 to 12 feet between agent and percipient; but
with greater separation (20-30 feet) the score fell off and ran about
chance average.

With Cooper distance too seemed to offer difficulty. He said he felt
"out of touch" with the agent. 300 trials made by him with Miss Ownbey
as agent yielded only an average per 25 of 5.8—without mathematical
significance. But Miss Bailey (who, incidentally works in a semi-trance
condition that is self-induced) was quite successful in overcoming the
"distance delusion" and in the short distances tried, 8 to 12 feet, and
30 feet, she held her scoring average up to par, obtaining in 475 trials
an average per 25 of 9.1 at the shorter and 12.0 at the longer, with 150
trials. Both scores are above her general average.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

Then Mr. Zirkle tried these shorter distances and after a time it
seemed, as with Miss Bailey (and contrary to what a wave mechanics would
lead us to expect), the farther away he got, the better he averaged. It
was quite remarkably so, in fact. At the beginning, however, he got only
a little above chance; he was at low ebb physically and was scoring then
only from 7 to 9 in the same room with the agent. So we cannot evaluate
the earliest 15 runs. They averaged only 4.8 per 25, and may have been
due to a belief that he could not score at a distance or due to illness,
or both. At any rate, on July 21 he got well, raised his regular (same
room) P.T. score from 7.4 (of the day before) to 15.0, and went into the
next room and conquered the "distance" obstruction at once by an average
of 19 per 25 in 5 magnificent runs. He then invaded the next room away,
adding still another wall between the agent and himself and reaching
28-30 feet distance, and made 5 runs, 125 calls with an average of 17
per 25. All the records were broken and on these data alone the
significance went soaring to the heights of fullest satisfaction. And
they continued. On the 22d he called 50 across the table from the agent
at an average per 25 of 10.5, 50 in the adjoining room (12 feet),
average of 16.5 per 25, and 50 at 30 feet, 12 in 25. By the 26th, when
he left the campus, we have for the period of restored health (which
omits the first 15 runs and begins with August 21), at close range, 100
at an average of 12.8 per 25, 750 at 12 feet, with an average of 14.6
per 25; and, at the longer distance of 30 feet, separated by two walls,
250 trials with an average of 16.0 per 25. The only way in which we can
suppose a law of inverse squares to apply here, as in wave mechanics,
would be to suppose some very strong compensating factor to be present
and to suppose the distance too small to be significant under the
circumstances. With this in view, then, the next experiment is very much
to the point.

Miss Turner and Miss Ownbey carried out, during the month of July, 1933,
a long distance experiment in pure telepathy, after the manner of the
shorter distance tests. The distance was well over 250 miles, from
Durham to Lake Junaluska, N. C. The principal exception to the regular
procedure was that the time and rate of calling had to be arranged by
correspondence. At first, 5-minute intervals were followed between calls
and this was later reduced to 3 minutes. Both followed official time and
worked by the arranged time intervals instead of the auditory signals
used in the laboratory.

Miss Turner was a particularly good subject for this, since she has
never shown the more usual drop with new techniques or conditions and
with new witnesses. She has even boldly and successfully demonstrated
her E.S.P. ability to one of her teachers who was openly sceptical. But
her previous work had not prepared me for the shock of the first results

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

of this 250-mile P.T. test. The first score was 19 hits in 25!
Unquestionably significant alone, even if she never called another card.
But the next 25 gave 16 correct, and the third again gave 16. These 75
calls alone yield 36 above the chance expectation of 15 and give an
"anti-chance" index of (X =) 15.7, which offers clinching satisfaction
to the critical mind from that point of view. What of the other
conditions? Miss Ownbey had turned her agent's record (made at the close
of the 5-minute intervals) over to me and Miss Turner was expected to
send her call records direct to me. She made an error and forwarded them
for all three days to Miss Ownbey. Miss Ownbey, whose record I already
had on my desk, brought the letters received from Miss Turner direct to
me; and for the benefit of the reader, I will state that the recording
was unmistakably in Miss Turner's own hand and ink, and no changes were
evident. The notes that were written under the record were unmistakably
those of Miss Turner. The point is, that if one of these excellent young
ladies were to be suspected, both would have to be. Besides any motive
to deceive me, difficult as it is to conceive it in these two, they
would never aspire so absurdly high as to give me 19 in 25 on the first
run! I confess I wrestled for hours with every possible escape from
accepting it as fact. And, to my mind, there is none.

Thereafter, the records came directly to me, from each one
independently, but the scoring fell off seriously. It was, of course, a
monotonous procedure sitting quietly for one hour and 15 minutes and not
knowing how well the scoring is going until several days afterward. The
whole list of scores ran as follows: 19, 16, 16, 7, 7, 8, 6, 2. At this
point we stopped the experiment for a time, to await a recovery. The
whole 200 trials average 10.1 per 25 and give a total positive gain over
chance average that is 10.8 times the probable error. It shows that pure
telepathy stands up under distance conditioning as no known physical
process does. This average of 10.1 in 25 for 200 trials is higher than
all Miss Turner's tests with Miss Ownbey right in the same room with
her. Now, there were 275 trials made with only a table between Miss
Ownbey as agent and Miss Turner as percipient and they yielded an
average of only 7.7 in 25. Again we have, as with Miss Bailey and Mr.
Zirkle, *an appearance of improvement with distance in P.T. scoring*,
rather than the decline expected by physical analogy. Miss Turner never
ran under any other conditions such scores as the "19, 16, 16" which she
got at once with "P.T. at 250 miles". There is an interesting suggestion
in these facts. I hesitate to state it, for it is not in the least
proved—purely hypothetic: that one who is at a considerable distance
from the agent tends to relax those sensory processes commonly depended
upon for perception and utilizes the process of extrasensory perception
the more; also, the rational judgment realizes its own

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

uselessness and ceases to obstruct the E.S.P. function; the result is
better abstraction and "concentration".

The "distance" work on P.T. is summarized in [Table
XXXVI](esp15.htm#an_tab36), in which will be given the records of the
four out of the five subjects of this chapter who have worked under this
condition. First will be given their regular score average made with
agent and percipient in the same room. Next will come separation by 8 to
12 feet, which means with a tile wall between the two subjects, with an
open door in the wall but not directly between the subjects, so that
vision was cut off. Third will come the 28-30 feet distance, with two
tile walls between but each with an open door. Last will come the long
distance (250 miles) data of Miss Turner.

In all these data, with distance or without it, there was no chance for
involuntary whispering (even if there were any!), since an electric fan
was kept going practically all the time. And the percipients in these
four cases do not look at the agent, even when in the same room. There
is no sensory contact between the two, except for the methodical and
uniform tapping of the telegraph key, and the calling aloud of the
percipient. The agent is silent. And, of course, at the long distance
all sensory contact is gone. The percipient does not know till the end
of a run of 25 how many are right. The symbol thought of by the agent is
not given objective record until after the call is made (thus excluding
B.T.), or, in the long distance work, after the time interval is about
gone and the call has supposedly been made by the percipient. The data
presented under the heading "Same Room" are restricted to those obtained
with the agents who worked on the distance tests also. This is done in
order to afford a better basis of comparison, since results vary so much
with different agents. We omit also the data of Zirkle during the period
of illness. For these see [Table XXXII](esp15.htm#an_tab32).

The table shows the general increase in scores with distance, and this
is more emphatically shown by totalling the distance P.T. data, as will
be done in [Table XXXVII](esp15.htm#an_tab37) showing that in large
numbers of trials distance makes a significant advance in scores. The
difference of 1.2 in the

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

average per 25 is of mathematically justified significance, being 5.8
times the p.e. for the difference. Two great points are affected by this
fact: first, on the question of sensory perception (unconscious or
fraudulent), it is very important indeed to find that the more the
possibility of sense perception is excluded by walls and distance, the
better the scores; and, second, on the question of the underlying
physics of the phenomena, it is most baffling to present-day physical
theorizing in terms of wave mechanics, since, instead of falling off
rapidly with the square of the distance, as all radiation intensity is
thought to do, it actually significantly increases with distance.

The P.T. totals of these five subjects have been given already in [Table
XXVII](esp15.htm#an_tab37) but are more fully presented here as a
background for completeness.

With these results our chapter closes but the work goes on. One wishes
at most points to go on to larger figures and for more variations, but
with 90,000 trials there is some justice in a pause for discussion.
Truth, however, is not a matter purely of huge figures, and we must
often be more attentive to small but meaningful series than to those
numbering in thousands.

I feel, however, that the task of interpretation of these data is not
one for the weeks spent in the writing of this report, but one rather
for years of thinking about them and discussing them. So that, however
they are interpreted now, I shall steadfastly refuse to defend the
interpretation and shall hold it as necessarily tentative. I hope that
readers will, in the main, do the same.

Here again we have to add a final note on current progress achieved
during the writing-up period. Miss Turner and Miss Ownbey resumed their
distance P.T. work after a short rest and at 300 miles distance this
time, but could not get back to good scoring. After four runs at chance
average they discontinued again for a time. Miss Ownbey was in an

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

unusual situation; she was expecting soon to be married and, for lack,
perhaps, of a better theory, we suppose it may have been hard for her to
give her fullest attention to the role of E.S.P. agent under such
circumstances. This is, of course, only a conjecture. Miss Turner stated
that she could not get back the feeling of *rapport*.

At the same time a P.C.-distance test was made with Miss Turner, Miss
Ownbey handling the cards for her. Miss Ownbey would place the card,
without observing its figure, on a book in the center of a table in her
home in Asheville, N.C., with which Miss Turner was familiar, and Miss
Turner in Wilson, N. C., would call the cards at the intervals arranged
for, every 3 minutes. These began low, 4 per 25 for the first 2 runs.
Then she rose to 7, 8, 7 in the next three, when the experiment was
interrupted for a time. (But see the Pearce distance-P.C. results, which
began about the same time, addendum to Chapter 7.)

Cooper and Miss Ownbey, too, were at this time engaged in a distance
P.T. experiment over 7 or 8 miles of extent but it did not rise above
the chance level, either, before it was interrupted. There were 7 runs
at an average of only 4.4. Cooper did not expect it to succeed, since at
a distance he loses his feeling of *rapport*.

Also at the same time Miss Ownbey and Zirkle tried distance P.T. at 165
miles, but got little above np or chance average, 5.5 in 25 for the 10
runs tried. This, too, may be interpretable in the same way as suggested
for the Turner-Ownbey failure. But, actually, we do not know, in so
complex a situation, all that might be concerned. Zirkle, too, felt out
of *rapport* and wrote his impression on his records before he knew of
the low scores he was making.

And, in some respects, it is more reassuring to have such failures
following such striking successes than to have uniform success. First,
because it is essential that we have variation of phenomena to reveal to
us the laws of nature. And, second, the sceptic can get some degree of
reassurance on the ground that at this point when we expected good
results to come in, as they had done before under the same conditions,
they failed us flatly, although any practise of deception was as fully
available as before. Nor was it because we changed conditions
essentially, except as the subjects themselves change from time to time.
There were, of course, three experiments being conducted with one agent
and, as mentioned before, she had other things on her mind. Naturally we
expect strain to interfere with perception; and good agency has been
shown above to be required for good P.T. perception. In any event, Miss
Ownbey's long and splendid record as agent can take a lot of failures
without appreciable suffering. And Miss Turner's brilliant series of
P.T. at 250 miles cannot be statistically impaired by a score of such
failures.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[91:1](esp15.htm#fr_78) Since the above was
written Cooper has begun D.T., with some success.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[92:1](esp15.htm#fr_79) Later on he did in fact
qualify very successfully, getting, in the 1,150 trials of the later
series, a deviation of over 15 times the p.e., and an average of 8 per
25, which is only .8 below his P.T. average for the same period.
