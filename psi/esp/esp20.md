### CHAPTER 13

#### <span class="smallcaps">E.S.P. From the Viewpoint of General Parapsychology</span>

No branch of science can have a central and stable body of knowledge
until it has established inner relationships between its own phenomena.
There have been frequent and persistent attempts among scientific
students

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

of parapsychology to do this, yet, so far as I know the literature,
never experimentally. <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95) Telepathy (or
telepathy and clairvoyance) has been offered by students of the subject
in England as an hypothetical explanation for phenomena representing
themselves as of incorporeal origin; clairvoyance, expanded to include
telepathy and named metagnomy, cryptesthesia, etc., has been offered
among the French in a similar way for the same purpose. There have been
those (notably Professor Hyslop) who reverse the matter and suggest the
"spirit" hypothesis as a possible explanatory principle for telepathic
and clairvoyant phenomena. The principal French students of
parapsychology (métapsychique) have favored clairvoyance (lucidity,
etc.), although they recognize telepathy and make a branch of it. The
English students of the subject, while recognizing clairvoyance
(telesthesia), have given emphasis and attention almost entirely to
telepathy, with comparatively little work on clairvoyance. And on
neither side of the channel has work been done with a view to finding
out the relations assumed to exist between the two. In fact, as we saw
in Chapter 2, most of the work done on the subject has been under
conditions that would allow both telepathy and clairvoyance. This was
pardonable, perhaps, at a stage where proof of a new mode of perception
was the major point.

The plan of this research undertaking is, first, to inter-relate the
simpler phenomena (simple from the point of view of production) of
telepathy and clairvoyance, and to relate these, as far as may be, with
physiological conditions and with other mental processes. Along with the
interrelating of telepathy and clairvoyance will go an attempt to relate
these to dowsing, parapsychic cognition of remote past events and the
prevision of future events. Next it is hoped to invade the incorporeal
para-psychical branch; *i.e.*, into the so-called "mediumistic"
phenomena. The plan will be to try to work with the same subjects, in
part; subjects, that is, who are capable in the simpler capacities. The
objective is to discover the basic laws underlying the whole; and to go
on to find, by similarities and differences, what the general character
of the greater phenomena of the parapsychological field can be analyzed
into.

It may be said now, I think, on good experimental evidence, that in
clairvoyance and telepathy we are dealing with the same basic process.
They have been carefully separated under the conditions of these
experiments and found to exist in clearly demonstrable capacity in 7 of
8 major subjects, as well as in some of the minor ones. Both capacities

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

have been independently demonstrated in 7 of the 8 and, since less than
two months have elapsed since the discovery of the only subject (Zirkle)
who cannot do both P.T. and P.C., we are not sure that he will not yet
discover that he can do P.C. work also. <span
id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96)

Not only do the subjects possess both clairvoyant and telepathic
capacity, but, what is more meaningful still, they score in both
conditions at about the same rate. Our use of the figures from the cards
as the basis for thought-images in P.T. work makes comparison easy. The
averages per 25 for all subjects are remarkably close when we compare
the P.C. and P.T. from the same periods of time (when that is possible).

These score averages are assembled for comparison in [Table
XLI](esp20.htm#an_tab41). In all cases where we have the data on both
P.T. and P.C. for the same period, these alone are given. P.C. is made
up of B.T. in these data; no D.T. results are used.

The results summarized in this table are most impressive; all the more
so, when we remember that the subjects were not themselves aware of the
averages they were making. To produce such regularity as this in such
large numbers is indeed to reveal what can hardly seem other than a
fundamental law—that P.C. and P.T. are similar phenomena and that, like
the blind brothers who went to "see" the elephant, we have long had in
these different "limbs" a hold on the same "body". E.S.P., then, can
work as well under P.T. or P.C. conditions; *i.e.*, telepathically or
clairvoyantly. But, as referring to distinct processes, there is
probably no clairvoyance and no telepathy. There is just this mode of
perceiving, extra-sensorially. The averages per 25 for the large totals
in Table [XLI](esp20.htm#an_tab41) should especially be noted. Back in
[Table XXIX](esp18.htm#an_tab39), where the P.C. and P.T. comparisons
were given for 4 major subjects, the average per 25 for

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

the four were 8.9 and 8.6 respectively. As the totals expand here to
large figures and include all 7 subjects, the difference is cut still
smaller, 8.1 and 7.9.

The results cited under P.C. for the first three subjects, Linzmayer,
Pearce and Stuart, are low for them. It just so happened that we had
them begin their P.T. work during their low period and, of course, the
P.C. offered as a basis of comparison must be taken under the same
conditions as nearly as possible. The P.C. and P.T. work here given was
done on the same days.

Not only do individuals score at roughly similar rates under both P.C.
and P.T. conditions, but, in the fluctuations occurring from day to day,
success under the two conditions, P.T. and P.C., go up and down together
(so far as we have data for these conditions), with only a few
exceptions—and these are clearly understandable as due to special
discriminating factors in three out of the four instances. In the 8 days
in which we have comparisons of P.C. and P.T. with Pearce (See [Table
XXIII](esp14.htm#an_tab18) in Chapter 7), and in the 8 days of the same
sort with Cooper ([Table XXIX](esp15.htm#an_tab29), Chapter 8) there are
altogether 14 such fluctuations, and of these only 4 are exceptions to
the rule that P.T. and P.C. go up and down together. This is all the
better in view of the fact that the P.C. and P.T. were often hours apart
on the same day. In one of these, the 4th day for Pearce, we have only
one run of 25 and it went unusually high, upsetting the balance. There
were also only 2 runs of P.C. This day's work could well be omitted as
not being represented by enough trials. On the 3rd day for Cooper, there
was an important difference in conditions between P.T. and P.C. The P.C.
was run in a comfortably cool room, the P.T. in our warm laboratory
where we almost always use an electric fan in summer and on this one day
the fan could not be located. It was, too, one of the hottest days of
the season. Cooper dropped flatly to chance, the only time he ever did
this in P.T. work at close range. Obviously, this, too, should be ruled
out of this special consideration. On one other day, the fifth, he could
not, for some reason, get started for the first 75 trials. The last 75
of the 150 were, therefore, taken as his level for the day, since the
merely "chance" scores of the first 75 simply meant nothing to the
particular comparison value sought here. On one occasion, the last day
for Pearce, he, too, dropped to chance (5.2) but for no known adequate
reason. It was his only day of this sort on the series and, so far as
can be recalled, in the whole of his experience. With these exceptions,
explained so that the reader may use his own judgment in excluding or
retaining them, the 14 daily fluctuations stand as a fairly clear
picture of similar changes in both P.T. and P.C. scoring under roughly
similar conditions. These joint fluctuations of both types of E.S.P.
under the

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

influence of the factors affecting the work from day to day add further
weight to the evidence of [Table XL](esp19.htm#an_tab40), all urging
that we have here but two applications of the same perceptual function;
that "telepathy" and "clairvoyance" are not merely separate processes
changing together; that seven of our eight subjects did not just happen
to score alike in P.T. and in P.C., and have almost exactly similar
averages (P.C. and P.T.), all together. Rather, it is likely that the
extra-sensory mode of perception fluctuates daily and its results under
both conditions must be similarly affected.

There are other special experiments and observations that have given
similar results in both P.T. and P.C. For instance, the sodium amytal
tests reduced alike the P.C. capacity and the P.T. It will be recalled
that a large dose completely reduced Linzmayer to chance scoring in
P.C., while a dose of 6 grains lowered Pearce from 10.0 to 6.1 in 25.
Now, a similar dose reduced Zirkle on P.T. work from 14.7 to 7.0 (in all
600 trials combined). On the other hand, caffeine affected Pearce on
P.C. and Zirkle on P.T. in the same way, raising the scoring in the
direction of the normal in both cases but not above it. Illness
(tonsilitis) lowered P.T. with Zirkle and P.C. with Pearce. Fatigue
affects both adversely and alertness helps both. All the dissociative
and re-integrative factors affect both sets of results in the same
direction.

What, then, about the effect of screens and other possible obstructions?
Both P.C. and P.T. can be done with a heavy cardboard screen concealing
the cards or agent. Both P.T. and P.C. work through walls of
construction blocks made of tiling. Both are disturbed by new changes
with certain subjects; *e.g.*, Pearce on P.C. and P.T. Both can be done
at the same rates of speed in general, if the agent is not a limiting
factor. Both show about the same range of fluctuation from day to day.
Both require about the same mental conditions, of "concentration",
effort, interest, absence of conflict, integration, etc., so far as the
data go to show. In a word, there has not been found a single
difference, as yet, in any phase of the experiments; everything pointed
to a single general process of E.S.P., divided here merely by the class
of "objects" perceived; *i.e.*, figures in ink or in the
thought-process.

The most crucial point in the examination of the two conditions, P.C.
and P.T., was on the question of effect of distance on the two. On
several different hypotheses of the nature of P.C. and P.T., distance
might distinguish between the two. Distance data eventually came in
strikingly with P.T., which was taken up first. The evidence was highly
satisfactory, when there was scoring above chance at all. (See [Table
XXXVII](esp15.htm#an_tab37), Chapter 8, especially Miss Turner's
brilliant long-distance scores.) For some time then the P.C. at a
distance was an unsettled point. But as I

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

write this chapter the data are rolling in magnificently from the
dependable work of Pearce on B.T. 25 at 100 yards distance from the
cards. He began low, as is his wont in new conditions. Then he rose
above his old level and held it until we changed him to a longer
distance, where he is now beginning. His results at 100 yards, from one
building to another, were, in hits per 25 trials, 3, 8, 5, 9, 10, 12,
11, 12, 11, 13, 13, 12, which is an average of about ten; but, after the
adjustment period, the average is 11.4, which is higher than Pearce's
B.T. average at close range (which is 9.4). (In fact, his average for
300 trials made at close range with the observer handling the cards, as
in the distance P.C., which is really the comparable condition, is
rather low—approximately 7.) Here again is a similarity which is
peculiarly significant, I think. Not only do both P.T. and P.C. succeed
at a distance, but they both seem to succeed, when the conditions are
favorable, definitely better than at close range. It will be recalled
that Miss Turner, Zirkle and Miss Bailey all improved their P.T. with
distance; Pearce improved his P.C. with distance, after the initial
adjustment period, in a brilliant series that gives a deviation of 12.6
times the probable error.

The cumulative effect of these uniformly favorable comparisons of P.T.
and P.C. results under various conditions has been to convince me of
their being a single function, simply with two conditions of
application—to two types of perceptual "object", card-figures and
thought-images. It will be of interest for the future to explore and
measure the extent of this E.S.P., carrying the search into all branches
of the field. It seems plausible to hope to be able to follow the E.S.P.
thread throughout the more typical parapsychical phenomena, since it
would appear to be necessarily basic to them, if not indeed to all
parapsychological phenomena.

If the percipient's mind is, as hypothetically suggested in Chapter 12,
a relatively free agent that can, under certain conditions, go out
space-free, escaping material limitations, it might well be expected to
be able to find in this spaceless order of reality whatever (if any)
strange forces or entities there may be. If there are incorporeal
personalities, it could "contact" them. If there are reservoirs of
knowledge, it might tap them, by a more transcendent clairvoyance. The
active agency of the percipient's mind and the non-spatiality of the
E.S.P. phase of mental life would, if established, make much more
plausible the complex mental phenomena of this field, as they are
reported and accepted by many. At least, the track of E.S.P. research
leads us straight toward all the higher phenomena, not regarding it as a
necessarily all-explanatory hypothesis but as a basic fact of the
natural capacity of mind that may serve as a guiding principle in the
necessary stages of hypothesizing and reorganizing in the general
parapsychological field.

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

By way of a minor suggestion, I have said earlier that the fact that
alertness and integration seem to favor E.S.P., while dissociation
hinders it, seems to me to make a point of difference between the
spontaneous parapsychic phenomena (often explained as telepathic, such
as premonitory dreams), on the one hand, and E.S.P. on the other. Such
spontaneous instances seem to be largely either dreams or experiences
occurring in a sleepy or relaxed condition, when E.S.P., as measured by
our tests, would be at a low ebb. It would appear, then, that there must
be a different process involved in these spontaneous cases—perhaps an
agency from without, that may, as in our P.T. work in which two good
E.S.P. subjects cooperate as agent and percipient, augment the
percipient's E.S.P. capacity by its own. In other words, it may intrude
largely in its own capacity. This possibility needs to be tested by
ascertaining by careful experiment whether a good E.S.P. subject can
intrude or force his thoughts upon a sleep-dissociated or relaxed
individual who is not attending or expecting this to happen. Cases are
reported of such occurrences but we need repetition under good
conditions, with "chance" expectation clearly measurable. The difference
here suggested between the majority of the spontaneous cases that are
called "spontaneous telepathy" or "spontaneous clairvoyance" instances
and our E.S.P. phenomena may be a very fundamental one, I think, in our
future parapsychological theory; on the other hand, it may be entirely
superficial and misleading.

Two great sub-headings of parapsychology, then, have been clearly
separated experimentally, independently established, each in its own
conditions, and then, by experimental evidence, pretty closely
identified as the same fundamental principle, merely with two different
applications. This has something of the synthetic value that the
discovery of the basic interrelationship of sound and wave mechanics,
for example, had in the early history of physics, constituting much more
elaborate experimentation but, no doubt, much more modest reflection. It
was just such progress in the unification of its branches that gave to
physics its great central system of laws. I think we may hope for the
same ultimate effect in parapsychology, if the work of synthetic
reorganization can be pursued with vigor and persistence.

There is a basis of encouragement for the hope of the last paragraph,
which is little more, perhaps, than a "clinical impression" and which I
mention in that spirit. I have come to think it a very reasonable
hypothesis that all the truly parapsychological phenomena for which
there is fairly general acceptance among the more critical investigators
may well be but various manifestations of the same function we have here
in E.S.P., most probably in combination with other special factors, in
the more peculiar types. That is, E.S.P. may be the general fundamental
capacity, possibly

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

an essential one for any parapsychological occurrence. The ground for
this "clinical impression" is this: among these 8 major subjects and
their very close blood relatives (I omit names here by request of some
and out of consideration for all) there have occurred almost all the
usual run of psychic phenomena that are at all commonly accepted by the
critical. I might mention the general clairvoyant "hunches" or
impressions, monitory dreams, premonitory "intuitions" and visions,
several varieties of phantasms of the dead, two haunted house cases with
several hallucinated witnesses, a number of mediumistic phenomena,
including violent physical manifestations with the table and other
furniture, and the like. None of the individuals involved have been
professional clairvoyants or mediums. None of the subjects has taken the
phenomena reported over-seriously; *e.g.*, they have not fully accepted
the common Spiritualistic beliefs regarding them. Without at all judging
the reality of these instances reported, except that I know of no reason
to question the veracity of any of the subjects who reported them—indeed
I even feel certain of their utter honesty—I wish to say that, should
such phenomena actually occur, it would appear somewhat probable, then,
that our own subjects might be led to go on to produce them "in the
laboratory". That is, if they or their close relatives have done these
things (or something, even less spectacularly, like them), and the
subjects are known to be parapsychic by their "telepathic" and
"clairvoyant" capacity, may we not with some justice hope to go on to a
development of other parapsychological phenomena and to a laboratory
study of them through known subjects of known powers? Of course, it is
as yet an hypothesis but not, I am sure, a wholly irrational one. And I
repeat, first, that this is not to assume that the reported occurrences
are proved to be genuine but merely that they are justly regarded as
problems worthy of serious study, and, second, that this is not an
attempt to make E.S.P. a simple explanation for everything
parapsychological. It is an attempt to follow it as far as it goes, and
to recognize, by methods of difference, other factors, *if* and when
they come in, and to establish the facts we work with, as we proceed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_95"></span>[147:1](esp20.htm#fr_95) Prof. Hans Driesch, in
a recent book *Psychical Research*, transl. by Th. Besterman (Bell,
London, 1933), in which he gives a very interesting discussion of
methods, problems and theories in the field, comes to the conclusion
that clairvoyance and telepathy are fundamental phenomena; that is,
fundamentally different phenomena. Not only are these fundamentally
different, but prophecy and psychometry also are added to the list of
fundamentals. These questions, however. of what is ultimate and
fundamental must surely be settled rather by the results of experimental
exploration, just as the questions of what are the fundamentals in
physics can be settled only in the light of experimental evidence.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[148:1](esp20.htm#fr_96) Two months later Zirkle
was encouraged to try B.T. again and with a somewhat different approach.
He succeeded very definitely in the 1,150 trials made during this later
period. These yielded 368 successes or an average of 8.0 per 25. There
was a positive deviation 15.2 times the p.e. It is most important to
add, too, that Zirkle's P.T. for this period was 8.8, which is very
close to the B.T. average.
