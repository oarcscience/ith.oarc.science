### APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 15

#### <span class="smallcaps">Suggestions to Those Who May Care to Repeat These Experiments</span> <span id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_102.md)

It is hoped that others will repeat these experiments or, better still
perform more advanced ones. Much depends upon the conditions of the
tests as to whether success or failure will follow. The following
suggestions along with the discussion in Chapter 12, may help to avoid
failures:

1\. The subject should have an active interest in the tests and be
fairly free from strong bias or doubt. These would, of course, hinder
effort and limit attention. An open-minded, experimental attitude is all
that is required. Positive belief is naturally favorable but not
necessary.

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

2\. The preliminary tests should be entered into very informally,
without much serious discussion as to techniques, or explanations or
precautions. The more ado over techniques, the more inhibition is
likely; and the more there is of explanation, the more likely is
introspection to interfere. Playful informality is most favorable.

3\. If possible to do so honestly, it is helpful to give encouragement
for any little success but no extravagant praise is desirable, even over
striking results. The point is that encouragement is helpful,
apparently, but only if it does not lead to self-consciousness. If it
does, it is quite ruinous. Many subjects begin well, become excited or
self-conscious, and then do poorly.

4\. Some begin more easily with P.T. and some with P.C. It depends upon
personality, I think, but I cannot explain it except to link sociability
with P.T. preference. However, both conditions should be tried,
following the subject's preference in the beginning.

5\. It is highly important to let the subject have his own way, without
restraint, at first. Later he can be persuaded to allow changes, after
he has gained confidence and discovered his way to E.S.P. functioning.
Even then, it is better for him to have his way as far as experimental
conditions can allow. It is a poor science that dictates conditions to
Nature. It is a better one that follows up with its well-adapted
controls and conditions.

6\. It is wise not to express doubts or regrets. Discouragement seems to
damage the delicate function of E.S.P. Here again no doubt personalities
differ. One subject, I know, has worked in the face of doubt expressed;
but she is exceptional in this.

7\. Above all, one must not, like several investigators, stop with only
25 or 50 or even 100 trials per subject. Most of my good subjects did
not do very well in the first 100. With few exceptions, the first 50 to
100 trials give the worst scores. With all my major subjects this is
true. Several different occasions or sittings, too, should be allowed,
for there is with most subjects an adjustment phase at first that may
take some time.

8\. It is best at first to have the subject alone with the agent in P.T.
and in P.C. to leave him alone entirely. If not, he may be inhibited
from the start; but, once he has a start, he can gradually work back to
other conditions. When he has observers present, the experimenter should
do all he can to put the subject at ease.

9\. Simple cards with 5 suits seem best as a compromise of several
features of concern: easy calculation, easy recall, easy discrimination
of images, etc.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

10\. Short runs are desirable, say 5 at a time, with a check-up after
each 5. Then it is best to go casually and quietly on without too much
discussion of results.

11\. It is advisable not to bore or tire the subject. When he wants to
stop, or even before he expressly wishes to, it is better to stop work.

12\. It is best to try good friends for P.T. at first—or couples, single
or married, who feel certain they have thought-transference; and, above
all, to try those people who say they have had "psychic" experiences or
whose ancestors conspicuously have had.

These are suggestions, not rules, for we do not yet know enough of the
subject to lay down rules. They will help toward success, without
endangering conclusions. One can always tighten up on conditions before
drawing conclusions later. But any investigator must first of all get
his phenomena to occur—or exhaust the reasonable possibilities in trying
to.
