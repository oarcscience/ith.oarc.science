### CHAPTER 11

#### <span class="smallcaps">Some Physiological Conditions Affecting E.S.P.</span>

If it is correct to assume some energetic causal relationship between
the percipient and the agent or card, as, I think, our scientific logic
requires, then the percipient is somehow intercepting energy of some
kind in E.S.P., clear as we may feel that E.S.P. is not simply a
phenomenon of shortwave transmission. But what is the receptor system by
which this is done? Is it an organ of the body or a non-material system?
Is the nervous system definitely involved in the primary act of
reception? Is E.S.P. a function of the integrated organism or a passive
reception depending upon dissociation? Does it require physical
orientation (*i.e.*, any turning toward) of any sort? Is the
reception-system given or developed? Can it be injured or destroyed?
These are some of the questions one wishes to have answered in terms
that are physiological in some measure. The work so far has not gone far
to answer them but it does offer something.

There is nothing to indicate that any special organ of the body is
involved in E.S.P. in the mere reception. There may be, of course, since
there is no way as yet of telling in a conclusive way. But the
circumstances are against it. First, no subject has ever had any
definite feeling of getting reception localized in any special organ or
tissue of his body. The process has been as unlocalizable as mind
itself. Sensory reception is, of course, easily localizable in the sense
organs. Second, there seems to be such a variety of angles and
directions, as well as distances, which the recipient may take with
respect to the source (agent or card) that it is quite clear no special
orientation is of importance. It may seem to be so to the subject at
first. He may feel that he can do best with the card in a certain place
but we are now certain that such inhibiting notions are grounded only in
his own misconceptions. They may continue to inhibit as long as he
actively expects them to and then cease. (Nothing may be treated with
more scepticism than the subject's explanations of limitations; yet they
are, as effective factors, to be taken seriously, however delusional
they may be.) Stuart after a time found he could work as well with the
cards behind his back. Linzmayer has worked well at nearly all
angles—with the card behind him, beside him, in front, on his stomach,
forehead, etc. Others, too, have had varied conditions with no important
difference in results. There is no evidence whatever for a reception
center recognizably more sensitive than any other part of the organism
and the facts just given are against it. This Extra-Sensory reception of
energy would seem to be a general, rather than a local, function. Is,
then, the organism as a whole involved?

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

One conclusion that seems fairly clear is that E.S.P. depends upon the
higher functions of the nervous system. It requires a degree of control
by the higher functions that permits a certain amount of
"concentration"; *i.e.*, attention to one thing and exclusion of others.
This depends upon a certain degree of integration of the nervous system.
Dissociative drugs, <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84) sleepiness and
certain illnesses work to lower this integration and self-control;
whereas drugs that antagonize dissociative drugs help to recover normal
control. And in our results the data show plainly that dissociative
factors likewise lower E.S.P. ability, while counteractive factors help
to restore it. <span id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_85)

The effect of sodium amytal has been rather strikingly destructive to
E.S.P. in all three experiments, with Linzmayer and Pearce in P.C., and
with Zirkle in P.T. The results are significant beyond question. (See
[Table XXXVIII](esp18.htm#an_tab38)).

There was here no serious interference with perceptual capacity itself,
since sensory perception was clearly possible. In all the common mental
processes, especially with Pearce and Zirkle, there was no serious
impairment. In ordinary conversation, attention was not lacking.
Rational responses were made to questions. In all the external features
of the experiment, there was no marked difficulty. Only the higher and
more complex features of nervous organization were altered. Does it
mean, therefore, that E.S.P. involves a higher and more complex nervous
process? I think it does suggest just that; though there may be a
relatively simpler and lower phase to the actual reception itself.
Perception, however, in requiring a recognition of the reception phase,
may involve the higher organization. Yet, I think it is fully possible
also, and a little more probable, that we are dealing with a phenomenon
of the super-organization of the brain process-system, one that in
itself may function only at a certain level of organization, yet not
involve specialized structure necessarily. This cannot be decided now,
however, and is not of importance here.

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

Sleepiness, whether from fatigue or from sodium amytal, has the same
effect of lowering the scoring. With Zirkle, too, in P.T. the effect of
caffeine was equally striking. The first treatment brought his average
up from 12.8 to 14.7 in 300 trials. The latter average is approximately
his average under normal conditions of health, rest, etc. But the best
test for caffeine came 5 hours after taking the sodium amytal. Under the
influence of the amytal he had dropped to an average of 6.2 in the last
300 trials. One hour <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86) after the 5 gr.
dose of caffeine, he rose to an average of 9.5, which is a rise of 3.3,
a marked and significant advance.

It is, then, only with the best functioning of the higher processes of
the mind that E.S.P. of either type succeeds well. It is, in this, like
creative thinking and higher mental skills. The composer, the inventor,
the poet, the reflective scientist needs this condition for his
constructive work. He requires the highest integration of the nervous
system for his best creation. He may, then, like some of these subjects
in E.S.P., go off into abstraction from the surroundings, amounting
almost to a trance. But this is an intensification of attention in one
direction by withdrawal from others. It is " concentration".

Not that E.S.P. is comparable in other respects to higher creative
mental work. It is not, as we shall see in the next two chapters. But it
does require, as they do, the highest integration of the nervous system.
The data on illness support this view, though it is amply established, I
think, anyhow. The following data, in [Table XXXIX](esp18.htm#an_tab39),
are to this point. The illnesses in the four cases were tonsilitis,
colds or flu, all very dissociative and depressing to most people, and
destructive to higher mental functioning.

There is another important bearing of the data reviewed here on the
connection between integration and E.S.P. It appears to favor the point

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

of the agency of the percipient himself in the process and to count
against the theories of passive percipience which we shall take up later
on—for example, the "spirit" hypothesis, which has been suggested to
explain telepathy and clairvoyance. My point is that, if a dream state,
with a light sleep, had been found favorable to E.S.P., we might have a
favoring circumstance for the theories of outside agencies. But, since
alertness is favorable and drowsiness is unfavorable, we must interpret
this as negative to the hypotheses which suppose outside agencies. It
will be recalled that many of the reported spontaneous
para-psychological experiences (of apparitions, voices, premonitions,
etc.) come during sleep, as veridical dreams, or during a time when
sleep is expected. The dissociation is then such that, according to our
results, E.S.P. would not be expected to succeed well, if at all. All
such spontaneous phenomena do, of course, as a rule, take on the
appearance of being activated by an outside agency, while in no case of
this E.S.P. work of ours is there any suggestion of that. I think, then,
that the facts reported here of the relations between dissociated
conditions and E.S.P. ability favor pretty strongly that hypothesis
which stresses the active agency of the percipient subject himself, for
the conditions of these experiments, rather than of the superior order
of agencies sometimes proposed. This would hypothetically separate this
experimental work from the spontaneous occurrences. If correct, this is
the most important point in the physiological data.

It has already been pointed out that, when sufficient amytal has been
administered to prevent or nearly prevent E.S.P., sensory perception is
still possible. Such a ranking in stability and complexity suggests that
the sensory antedates the extra-sensory in the evolutionary development
of mental processes. This is counter to some of the speculative
hypotheses which attribute telepathy to the amoeba, the ant and other
lower animals, as a pre-sensory and a pre-language mode of
communication. There has been no favoring fact for this hypothesis, to
my knowledge, except the mere convenience of closing two gaps in our
knowledge by one theory. Telepathy or clairvoyance in birds, if any
exists, as is believed by many from the general facts of homing,
migration and simultaneous group responses (and I am not convinced), or
in dogs and horses, of which instances have been reported in the
scientific literature <span id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87), is a quite
different matter. For here we have sensory perception already developed
to a very high degree. I venture to suggest, therefore (and *merely* to
suggest), that sensory may be evolutionarily prior to extra-sensory
perception. I propose this because nervous dissociation more quickly
affects the extra-sensory capacity, and that, in general, this would
mean greater specialization and complexity, as well as less stability
and basic biological survival value.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

The general effect of the physiological observations of the effect of
fatigue, of amytal, caffeine, illness and sleepiness has been to
"naturalize" fully the whole function of E.S.P., making it as clearly
natural a process as any other physiological or psychological
phenomenon. For in these drug tests we have been arbitrarily controlling
the phenomenon in question, lowering and raising it at will, according
to an already established principle of the effect of the drugs on the
nervous system, and assuming that E.S.P. is a phenomenon of that system.
The assumption has been borne out very satisfactorily in every test, and
we may now without hesitation invite the attention of physiologists to
another mode of energy reception and to another function of the nervous
system.

But does the fact of the causal connection established between cards and
percipient or between agent and percipient, apparently involving a
work-producing or energetic sequence, necessitate our calling the
process "sensation" and designating the unknown receptive system a
"sense", as Frederic Myers and Charles Richet have done (in Myers’ case
by implication in his proposed term telethesia for clairvoyant
perception and in Richet's case by definite statement; see his book,
*Notre Sixième Sens*, Paris, 1928)? I think not, indeed. None of the
features of E.S.P. have indicated or suggested sensation or sense
organs. First, the E.S.P. experience seems rather to be that of a more
complex level, one that is readily broken up by sodium amytal and
fatigue while the senses are still functioning. Second, the experience
of the percipient is one of cognition or "knowing", not a "sensing" in
the strict psychological meaning of the word. That is, he knows but
cannot tell "how he knows"; there is no analysis possible apparently, as
there is for sensory perception. Third, there is no consciousness of
localization of the basis of the cognition, as is possible in sensory
perception. Fourth, and objectively, there seems to be no special
orientation required for success. Fifth, as shown in the last chapter,
there is the further basic difference also that the known energy forms
seemed inadequate as a physical basis for E.S.P., yet they are the known
basis of all known sensory perception. This is at least a very great
difference between them, if not a conclusive one.

It is a given fact, obvious in the experience of the percipient, that
there is cognition. And cognition of an object outside of the organism
would be perception. Future discoveries may reveal something comparable
to sense structures and functions, but thus far they have not. Instead,
the facts of the last paragraph above lead us strongly toward the
opposite conclusion, that this mode of perception is above and outside
the sensory sphere, and is likely to be more of a total response,
undifferentiable and unanalyzable—a reception on the complex level of
knowing. Hence I call it "Extra-Sensory Perception". But to avoid
spending my time in

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

disputing a mere name, I agree to mean by this merely "Perception by a
means or way that is outside the now recognized sensory modes."

The expression "Supersensuous Perception" has been used by certain
English writers on the subject and, personally, I think "super" probably
indicates hypothetically the right relation E.S.P. has with the sensory
mode; but it is an unnecessary additional hypothesis; also "super" often
simply means "highly" or "overly", as in "supersensitive", and this
would be ambiguous; and, finally, it suggests to some the undesirable
connotation of "supernatural".

It is probable that someone has already used the expression
"Extra-Sensory Perception"; and I should like to regard its use here as
a choice rather than an attempted innovation. Mr. Harvey L. Frick
entitled his M.A. Thesis submitted to this Department in 1931
"Extra-Sensory Cognition". But this is not specific enough; rational and
mnemonic cognition would also be "extra-sensory". Perception is
cognition of outer objects or relations, and is therefore, the proper
word here. Extra-Sensory, then, limits it in the necessary way.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_84"></span>[127:1](esp18.htm#fr_84) I am drawing the
general principles stated here largely from Prof. McDougall's discussion
of "Fatigue Drugs, and Sleep", Chapter III of *Outline of Abnormal
Psychology*, Scribners, 1926, and from his earlier work on the mutual
antagonism of certain drugs in their influence on certain mental
processes.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[127:2](esp18.htm#fr_85) Brugmann's results of
increased "telepathy" with 30 grams of [alcohol](errata.htm#6) (See
Chapter 2) are not contradictory. So small an amount would not for many
individuals be noticeably dissociative. In small amounts this drug gives
the effects of stimulation through the removal of inhibitions and the
vasomotor changes. But a certain dulling of sensory acuity would
probably add to ease of abstraction, too. These considerations are
adequate to account for Brugmann's results.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[128:1](esp18.htm#fr_86) After discussing these
results with Prof. McDougall in the light of his researches on
drug-antagonisms, I see that one hour was not long enough after the drug
ingestion for the maximum effect. In fact, the subjective report of
Zirkle confirmed this point. He was more alert several hours later.
Prof. McDougall found five hours after ingestion to be the time of
greatest effect for caffeine.
