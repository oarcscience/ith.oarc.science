### CHAPTER 7

#### <span class="smallcaps">Hubert E. Pearce, Jr.</span>

Of all the eight "major subjects" Mr. Pearce has done the greatest
amount of work and has been put through the greatest variety of
conditions. He has been relatively very stable in his scoring in spite
of these conditions and has been very co-operative throughout. In fact,
he has sportingly entered into new ventures and conditions whenever they
have been proposed.

Pearce is a young Methodist ministerial student in the Duke School of
Religion, very much devoted to his work, though fairly liberal in his
theology. He is very sociable and approachable, and is much interested
in people. There is also a pretty general artistic trend to his
personality, expressing itself mainly in musical interest and
production, but extending into other fields of art as well.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

Pearce has not, himself, had any striking parapsychological experiences
other than numerous "hunches" and "intuitions", but he reports that his
mother and others of her family have had certain clairvoyant
experiences. It was on learning from him of these experiences of his
family that I asked him to try our clairvoyance tests with my assistant,
Mr. Pratt.

All of Pearce's work has been carefully witnessed; but I wish to state
in addition that I have fullest confidence in his honesty, although in
this work the question of honesty arises in my mind with every one,
preacher or no.

In the beginning of his clairvoyant work, in the first 50 trials, Pearce
got only chance average and rose very little above on the first 100
trials. But he kept on rising until very soon he had reached a level of
9 or 10 correct per 25 trials and has held to this average ever
since—now over a year, and well over 15,000 trials—except in
experimentally produced situations that definitely work against the
E.S.P. capacity and a few other occasions (illness, etc.). Even
including a lot of special experiments at which he was handicapped and
including his one short ill period, his totals up to April 1, 1933, were
11,250 trials with an average of nearly 9 (8.9) hits per 25. Such
results as this are positively breath-taking, when one calculates their
mathematical significance. These alone sky-rocket the value of X up
above 60, with odds against chance now enormous beyond our capacity to
appreciate.

During the late Spring of 1932 Pearce ran 2,250 calls under pure
clairvoyance conditions and with the remarkable average per 25 of 9.7,
almost double the chance average. Some of these (275) were witnessed by
me alone, several hundred by both Pratt and myself, and the rest by
Pratt alone. The working conditions were these: observer and subject sat
opposite each other at a table, on which lay about a dozen packs of the
Zener Cards and a record book. One of the packs would be handed to
Pearce and he be allowed to shuffle it. (He felt it gave more real
"contact".) Then it was laid down and was cut by the observer. Following
this Pearce would, as a rule, pick up the pack, lift off the top card,
keeping both the pack and the removed card face down, and, after calling
it, he would lay the card on the table, still face down. The observer
would record the call. Either after 5 calls or after 25 calls,—and we
used both conditions generally about equally—the called cards would be
turned over and checked off against the calls recorded in the book. The
observer saw each card and checked each one personally though the
subject was asked to help in the checking by laying off the cards as
checked. There is no legerdemain by which an alert observer can be
repeatedly deceived at this

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

simple task in his own laboratory. <span id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74.md)
(And, of course, we are not dealing even with amateur magicians.) For
the next run another pack of cards would be taken up.

Further reassuring features on the point of deception are: first, when
Pearce got to running well, he seldom looked at the backs of the cards;
later we asked him, as a rule, not to do so. On the whole results under
this condition are as good as before. We later added the request to call
the top card before lifting it off the pack. And this, too, was
successful after a period of adjustment. Then we brought in new cards
many times, without there resulting any change in the level of scoring.
We had Pearce follow the procedure of working with the cards held behind
a screen and this, too, succeeded after the low period at first, that
accompanies nearly every innovation. And, finally, he does very well
under the remarkable D.T. condition, in which the pack is left unbroken
on the table while the subject makes the 25 calls in succession for the
cards before him. Most of the time in working at D.T. Pearce closes his
eyes and takes a posture of strong concentration; it seems as if this
were a more arduous task for clairvoyance than the ordinary conditions.

On all the points mentioned in the last paragraph above the evidence is
amply significant, as may be seen in the following table
([XVIII](esp14.htm#an_tab18).md) summarizing the data just referred to. It
is a table packed, I believe, with tremendous meaning, the most
evidential of the entire series.

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

It does not seem possible that any reasonable and honest doubt can exist
in the mind of the reader who accepts this table as reliably presented
(and if it is clear to him) that there is amply demonstrated in these
tests an extra-sensory mode of perception, of the type popularly known
as clairvoyance. It did not, therefore, seem profitable to spend more
time and effort in the mere pursuit of evidence for the existence of
E.S.P. What more, indeed, can be asked for simple proof's sake? With a
value of X, the anti-chance index of 61.5, such that the door is
"slammed" on the chance-theory; and with the D.T. data, the screen data,
and the New Card data together removing the weakened remains of the
"sensory-cues" theory from the realm of rational possibility, what
alternative to E.S.P. is there left, except to suppose that we are *all*
(a dozen or more are involved) playing a deeply complex game of
deception, or else are thoroughly irresponsible and unreliable? <span
id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md)

On the point of reliable witnessing and judgment, then, there is a set
of data on observations that were witnessed by other mature and
responsible persons, some of them professional men. Each one witnessed,
along with me, the production of the data set opposite his name in Table
XIX and in no case raised any question as to the genuineness of the
effectual exclusion of sensory perception of the card-symbols. The data
of columns B and C were doubly witnessed in their entirety, the visiting
observer seeing as much as he cared to and taking any part or position
desired. The magician, Mr. Wallace Lee, tried a few series himself with
only chance average results. He said frankly that he was convinced. It
appeared that he was, at least as far as we all are, "mystified". Pearce
was somewhat ill with tonsilitis on the day the magician was present,
hence (as I think) his low scoring, even for the period before the
entrance of the visitor. Note the splendidly high value of X for these
results, 23.5. With these excellent doubly witnessed results, which help
to divide the responsibility on the face of a supposed charge of "poor
observations", we will dismiss for this chapter the question of proof
and report the special experiments made for the purpose of throwing
light on the nature of the process.

The data in [Table XIX](esp14.htm#an_tab19.md) were originally collected
for the purpose of measuring the extent of the inhibitory effect of
visitors upon the clairvoyant function. We had noticed earlier that when
someone dropped in to watch Pearce work the scores at once dropped down.
We began to take down the evidence, sometimes inviting a visitor for the
purpose, sometimes availing ourselves of a casual caller. We recorded
the time of entrance and exit on 7 visitors, one being present twice.
They all produced a drop in Pearce's scoring. The results taken before
the entrance

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

will be stated in Column A and then in Column B will be given results
taken from the point of entrance, continuing until there is an upward
turning of the score curve that remains above mean chance expectation
for at least 2 runs, with the remainder of the series averaging above
chance. The curves are all sharp enough to make decision easy. Column C,
then, contains the scores made after the up-turn of the curve described
as the stopping point for B, which means after Pearce had become
adjusted to the visitor's presence. The number of runs in B is evidently
indicative of the difficulty experienced in adjusting to the visitor's
presence. Notice it is larger (11 runs, 275 trials) for the magician,
whose vocation Pearce knew, than for Miss E. C. (1 run), a young lady,
or for Dr. McDougall (2, 5), who he knew was sympathetically interested
in the results. In consulting [Table XIX](esp14.htm#an_tab19.md) for this
point compare especially the 3rd column under the headings A, B, and C,
giving the average hits per 25 trials as a basis for comparison.

We have in A and C about the same scoring level, showing eventually
complete adjustment to the new situation. This would seem to mean that
visitors are not inhibitory except in the strain excited in the
subjects. Naturally, subjects would differ in degree of this, as
visitors would differ in their effect. We have here a drop of 4.1 in 25,
82% of chance average (np), a figure very significant with the large
number of trials given.

Following along on the theme of disturbing factors, we may properly take
up next the illness effect shown in the results opposite the name of the
visitor, Wallace the Magician. Pearce had not done well even before
Wallace came in. The difference between the average of 7.5 and 7.4 and
those of 10.5 and 11 on days preceding is a significant one for the
number of trials made. This was the only illness the records show for
the time

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

we have worked with Pearce but the result is in harmony with the results
of other subjects. So it seems plausible to agree with Pearce's own
judgment and connect the illness as a causal factor in the production of
375 results with a drop from 10.5 per 25 to 7.5, which is 3 per 25. On
375 this would be a drop of 45, which is over 6 times the p.e. diff.
(7.4).

Another factor that upsets Pearce's scoring, as a rule, is any change
that he does not easily and spontaneously accept as likely to work. A
few changes he has taken without a considerable drop, those apparently
in which he has taken part in the planning and in which he felt sure of
success. Among these were the use of very small figures on the cards
(about 2mm. high) which he suggested, the D.T. procedure which he partly
originated himself and the calling for Low Scoring, voluntarily proposed
half-playfully. These all succeeded at once and were all, at least
partially, instituted by Pearce himself. But most changes meet with a
drop to chance scores. I have collected the data on the introduction of
a few of the new techniques, with the results taken during and after the
transition, grouping them, as we did in [Table XIX](esp14.htm#an_tab19.md),
into Columns A and B. For a fair comparison, I have taken equal numbers
of runs made next after the transition to that made during it. Compare
especially the 3rd column under A and B.

From the high recovery level of 10.1 in 25 Pearce is shown here to have
dropped almost to chance, 5.6 per 25. This drop of 4.6 in 25 is 92% of
np. and leaves no doubt of the point that the introduction of new
procedures, when they do not just spontaneously come in, is a quite
disturbing thing to the E.S.P. function in Pearce. There is some
evidence that this may not be as much the case with some subjects, but,
again, may be still worse with some others.

Still following the matter of disturbing factors, we come to another
line of influence on E.S.P., this time a more physiological one. I refer
to the work done with sodium amytal on Pearce, simply repeating the
amytal experiment carried out earlier with Linzmayer. Pearce was asked
to take 6 gr. of the drug (He is light in weight.), and a half hour
later was tested on the cards in the usual way and found almost to have
lost his ability, as had Linzmayer. He had averaged 14.5 hits per 25 in
50 trials just preceding the taking of the drug. Now that the effects of
drowsiness were showing, when he was tested he got only 5, 4, 3 in
succession. He had become careless, fumbled the cards, spoke dully and
mostly kept his eyes closed It may be interesting to follow the
variations of the data in [Table XXI](esp14.htm#an_tab21.md).

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This phenomenal
fall from his usual average per 25 of about 10 down to 6.1 is even more
striking than Linzmayer's drop from 6.8 to 5 and confirms the earlier
result. In both cases we ran enough trials to recover from the possible
novelty or new technique effect. One feature that is rather well brought
out as an incidental observation is the factor of effort No one could
have failed to see the coincidence of intense effort at attention to the
task, with better scoring, in this series of runs with the amytal.

This interesting experiment invites quite naturally a comparable one
with a drug having the opposite effect—that of integration. We used
caffeine for this purpose in 1-grain tablets of citrated caffeine. The
effect of caffeine was tried on Pearce on five occasions, using 5-grain
doses. The general aim was to give it when Pearce had been running low
(hence the low pre-caffeine score quoted), since it has been caffeine's
"de-fatiguing" effect that is most recognized. Under those conditions it
raised his scoring very considerably. We may compare the records of work
just preceding the drug-taking with those following for the experimental
period. The data are fragmentary, due to the cutting-in of other
experiments which were usually brought in as soon as the scoring level
rose again. The results are summarized in [Table
XXII](esp14.htm#an_tab22.md).

From these data it is evident that, using chance average as a basis of
percentage (5 hits in 25), we have got a rise following the drug
ingestion from 44% above chance average to 100% above chance average(
56%). Now, this latter figure (100% above np.) is just about Pearce's
normal rate. What we have done, then, is to pull him back up to his
usual running score, taking him at a time when he is scoring low to
begin with. It will take more experimentation to ascertain if he can be
raised above his own past level significantly by the use of caffeine.
There is, however, not the reason to expect this that we had for the
results just stated. For the important condition of the subject being
unaware of the nature of the drug and of its effect, see in Chapter 8,
the experiment carried out with Mr. Zirkle.

It was of interest to test the process of E.S.P. for fatigue in itself,
especially since in certain long series there is always a question
concerning the possibility of fatigue coming in as an unknown and
uncontrolled element. We had Pearce go through about 8 hours of steady
E.S.P. work and in that time he made 900 trials. They show, however, no
significant signs of decline and he showed at the end no unusual signs
of fatigue in

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

general. Of course, it was confining and tiresome, as any such work must
be, but nothing more. We did a mixture of experiments, contributing data
to a number of minor lines of inquiry. This variation was superficial,
however, since it was all genuine E.S.P. of the P.C. condition. His
average for the 900 trials was 10.1. It was only slightly (1.4 in 25)
lower in the afternoon than in the forenoon; this difference is not
significant for that number of trials. This day's work of 900 trials
will be of interest to Miss Jephson <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_77.md),
who suggests a "fatigue curve" in runs of only 5 trials.

I have mentioned earlier the purposively-low-scoring tests carried out
by Pearce. He showed that he could alternate high and low scores on
request, actually giving on one occasion 9 in 25 when asked for a
high-score run, followed by 1 in 25 for low; then a request for high
brought 10, and one for low another 1 in 25. He has, on the one hand,
called *0 in 25* by calling "wrong" purposely, and, on the other, once
called *25 correct in 25* in my presence when I playfully dared him, bet
with him and thereby aroused special effort with him over each card. (I,
myself, held the cards.) Of the "Low Scoring" record there are 275
trials, yielding only 20 hits, 35 below chance average. This is in
itself a valuable bit of evidence of the purposive principle of E.S.P.
at work, since X here equals 7.8 as an "anti-chance" value.

So far we have said little about Pearce and telepathy. He took rather
slowly to it, as the data in [Table XX](esp14.htm#an_tab20.md) have shown.
But eventually he emerged from the transition level of scoring and began
to do fairly good P.T. work. We undertook first to introduce the
telepathic condition into the P.C. experiments for comparison of P.C.
with the combined conditions. There are some data on this, showing that,
while at first Pearce dropped off considerably if I looked at the card,
he came eventually to do even somewhat better than when I did not look
at it. Omitting, then, the first 175 transition trials which gave an
average per 25 of only 6 and which belong under "New Technique Data", we
have 350 trials of the combined conditions, giving an average of 14 hits
per 25. This is an extraordinarily high average for Pearce or anyone
else, and is significantly elevated above Pearce's usual level of about
10 in 25. It may well be the effect of the combined extra-sensory
activation from the two sources (the card and the agent) or, of course,
may result from the possibly greater attention stimulated in the
percipient by the combined conditions of C and T. Or, again, it might
have been the effect of suggestion arising out of the expectation that
such results would occur. At any rate, a refinement of conditions was
necessary.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

To get at the question, then, of whether the telepathic condition really
aided the clairvoyant or not, we tried having the agent work behind a
screen so that Pearce, the percipient, would not know when the agent
looked at the card and when we had the simple P.C. conditions alone.
Here again we had transition troubles but they were, of course, equal
for both conditions, P.C. and general E.S.P. From a total of 600 trials
made behind a screen which concealed the agent's face and the cards from
Pearce, we still got quite better results for the combined telepathic
and clairvoyant conditions. See [Table XVIII](esp14.htm#an_tab18.md), 6, a
and b. The 300 P.C. were so interwoven with the 300 general E.S.P. that
Pearce could not have inferred any order in them. Usually I changed
conditions after every 5 calls. The difference is considerable, yet it
is not quite up to the requirement for significance, with this number of
trials. The difference is only 2.6 times the p.e. of the difference;
but, supported as it is by the greater difference found without the
screen, it appears rather convincing that the telepathic condition may
help clairvoyant perception to higher proficiency.

On P.T. itself Pearce showed a steady rise for a time. His first 250
P.T. trials averaged only 6.4 per 25. The next 250 rose to 7.3, and the
third, 7.8. His first 950 gave an average per 25 of 7.1 and a value of X
of 9.6. We can now say without any question, so far as the mathematical
significance of the data is concerned, that he, too, possesses both P.T.
and P.C. capacity.

In the 950 P.T. trials referred to above, the agent and percipient were
in the same room. The percipient sat with closed eyes, waiting for the
uniform tap of a telegraph key as a signal. At the time of the signal
the agent would be holding in consciousness the image of one of the
symbols of the Zener cards, but actually had no cards present. The
choice of order of images was planned by the agent for each 5 trials,
avoiding any naturally expected order, and varying, repeating, in
"random" fashion from one five to another.

Four agents served with Pearce. With Stuart he averaged 7; with myself
as agent, 7.3 (omitting the transition period). But with two charming
young ladies, he averaged 8.7!

And now for what is at the moment one of the most fascinating points of
the Pearce study. He, too, runs P.T. scoring at approximately the same
rate as the P.C. done at the same time and with the same conditions. The
time and circumstances are most important, and we need to have the
control data from the same situation and time period as the primary
data. And from our results it is now clear that when we compare P.C. and
P.T. with Pearce under the same conditions, we get, as with most other
subjects, about the same rate of scoring in the two phases of E.S.P.,
P.C. (B.T.) and P.T. There are two sets of data to offer in this
connection, the first

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

from the P.T. data already presented, merely omitting the transitional
data of the first 175 trials as not properly comparable. These P.T.
trials are quite similar in score value to the B.T. data taken during
the same experimental periods. In the one case there is an average of
7.7 hits per 25; in the other, 8.1. The second set of data come from an
experiment to be described below, made by Stuart and Pearce in the
summer of 1933 on the comparative effect of distance upon P.C. and P.T.
The results under distance conditions were but little above chance
expectation for even the relatively short distances introduced and in
these tests they show mainly the fact that they both dropped together
(B.T. to 5.3 and P.T. to 5.7). See Table XXIV below. The scores made
across the table are also quite comparable, averaging in the one case
6.4 and in the other 6.3. The details are shown in Table XXIII. It
should be said in explanation that, in giving the detailed results in
the table, the point is to show the fluctuations from day to day, since
these run predominantly in the same direction for both the P.C. and the
P.T. columns.

Nothing could be at this state more interesting than to see so large a
group of data turn out such similar score averages for the two different
conditions of experimentation, "mind-to-mind" and "card-to-mind"
transference. The fact that Pearce has on the whole scored much higher
in clairvoyant work does not bear on this point here. Perhaps, under
different conditions, he might also score higher on P.T. The data for
the two phases cover the same general conditions and the same periods.
There is, too, the general similarity between P.T. and P.C. in the
direction of fluctuation from day to day. If we leave out the 4th and
8th lines, all the rest of the 9 show a rise or fall of both
clairvoyance and telepathy together, both taking the same direction. In
the 4th line, at least, we have

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

a peculiar atypical instance, with only 1 run to deal with under P.T.,
and with the 8th line we just have an exception.

The latest experiment with Pearce, conducted by Stuart, did not succeed
very definitely. Pearce's scoring was the lowest it has ever been. There
is no reason to think there was anything in the combination with Stuart
that inhibited him. Pearce, himself, thinks it is because he had been
somewhat exhausted by the year's school work and was not in his usual
state of vigor. The purpose of the series was to test the relative
effect of distances upon the three main modes of testing in use, P.T.,
B.T. and D.T. It is probable, I think, that the elaborate conditions and
plans laid down (three conditions multiplied by the three distances make
a somewhat complex design in this work) were inhibiting, as new
techniques usually are with Pearce. The distances were to be short at
first and they did not get beyond these short distances. The results are
presented in the three conditions at the three distances; the three
columns represented the distances: A, close range, *i.e.*, across the
table; B, 8 to 12 feet away from the agent or the card; and C, 20 to 30
feet away. In all there were 5,400 trials made under the three
conditions, with all three distances. During the experiments an electric
fan was kept going and all "unconscious whispering" sounds during P.T.
work must have been effectively drowned by its noise. The telegraph key
was used for giving signals from agent to percipient. The results, I
think, do not warrant any greater detail in presentation. Later work has
already "outshone" them considerably. Probably only one point further is
of sufficient interest to mention and it is not at all adequately
substantiated. It will be seen that the D.T. results under A are the
highest. Yet this D.T. work scores lowest with distance, as shown in
Column B and C. It simply raises the question whether the precision
required to read the cards packed closely together can be achieved at a
distance even of 10 feet or whether this is an effect of the mental
attitude of the subject, an "expectation effect"; *i.e.*, he cannot
because he thinks he cannot.

It was pointed out above that in the P.T. and B.T. work of the
Pearce-Stuart series, the results obtained with the percipient in the
same room with the agent or the cards, were remarkably similar. Now, at
the distances used, 8-12 feet and 28-30 feet, both D.T. and B.T.
together do not show enough positive deviation to reach mathematical
significance (1525: 322: 17±10.5; X =1.6) . Whereas the P.T., which in
the same room yielded less than the D.T. and about the same as the B.T.,
yielded at the shorter distance (8-12 feet) a positive deviation over 5
times the p.e. and the whole distance-P.T. data have a value of X (4.3),
above the usual requirement for significance (4). This naturally raised
the question as to whether there was a genuine difference between P.T.
and P.C. on this point of distance

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

testing, or whether we had here to do again merely with mental attitudes
that offered different limitations for the two conditions.

In Tables [XXIV](esp14.htm#an_tab24) and [XXV](esp14.htm#an_tab25.md) will
be shown the results just described. The entire 5,400 results are really
very significant, giving a gain over chance expectation (np) that is
11.4 times the p.e. But for Pearce they are very low, giving an average
of only 6. per 25 instead of his usual level of 10 or thereabouts. The
points of interest lie chiefly in the column of "average per 25". The
contrast of these averages in general columns A and D in Table
[XXIV](esp14.htm#an_tab24.md) are worth attention, as are the 5th and 7th
columns in Table [XXV](esp14.htm#an_tab25.md). These bring out the point of
the difference between P.T. and B.T. results with distance, and their
similarity at close range, suggesting that while P.T. can clearly be
done at such distances, it may be that B.T. may not. It is still more
strongly suggested that D.T. may be limited to close range.

The fact that in D.T. work at close range Pearce did almost as well as
usual, but fell off in his B.T. and P.T. suggests, of course, that the
inhibiting factor was more operative under B.T. and P.T. conditions.
This leads one to look for some distracting set of circumstances in the
procedure, in the change to Stuart's conditions, since B.T. and P.T.
naturally allow more opportunity for disturbance than does the D.T.;
*i.e.*, in the D.T. work the subject is most independent of his
surroundings.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

And, finally, the curves! Pearce's work is full of interesting relations
that can be drawn up in graphic form. But these will be presented in
later chapters, and are omitted here because they do not involve any
other data than have already been given and were not the result of
planned experimentation. Pearce's D.T. curve shows the same dip for the
central part of the pack that the others showed (Linzmayer and Stuart).
He has a very marked curve of calling on his B.T.-5 trials (*i.e.*, made
5 calls at a run, followed by a check-up). There are regions of relative
emphasis in his other work as well, all pointing to the lawfulness of
the processes of E.S.P. and their natural inter-relationship with other
functions.

We have in Pearce's work no adequate estimate of its importance in the
mere index of the value X, but this is in itself a figure so large in
significance that we can no longer appreciate it. It is, for the 17,250
trials performed by Pearce since the Spring of 1932, 64.9. When this is
merged with the value left at the close of the last chapter, the figure
vaults now to 75.3 for the entire 64,224 trials reported to this point.
We must all agree that after reaching this point it would be almost a
deliberate waste of time to try to add to the mere significance or
weight of the evidence for E.S.P. The principal blocks of Pearce's data
are indicated in the following summarizing table,
[XXVI](esp14.htm#an_tab26.md):

In order to give a correct picture of the state of progress and constant
flux of these E.S.P. experiments, I will simply add to this chapter as
it is being copied the latest fruits of Pearce's work. It is in many
respects the best yet and answers several important questions at once.
The experiment is supervised by Mr. Pratt and is a long distance-P.C.
(B.T.) test. Pratt picks up, in a room in the Physics Building of Duke
University, every minute during the running period a card taken from a
cut and shuffled pack that lies on the table before him, and puts it
face down on top of a book. He does not look at its face. At the
beginning of the same

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

minute, Pearce, in the Duke Library, over 100 yards away, tries to
perceive the card then " exposed" by Pratt. He has succeeded,
magnificently, in doing so. At first he failed, as he nearly always does
with a new condition procedure. But the runs mount as he goes, as
follows: 3, 8, 5, 9, 10, 12, 11, 12, 11, 13, 13, 12. The total 300 at
that distance average 9.9 per 25; X = 12.2 and excludes the
chance-hypothesis. If we exclude the first three runs, as "adjustment
phase" trials, regularly required for Pearce, we have an average per 25
of 11.4, which is higher than Pearce's level for B.T. at close range. In
fact, in his B.T. with the same technique, carried out in the same room
with the cards but with the latter invisible—conditions the same as
reported just above, except that Pearce was a few feet from the card
instead of 100 yards—in 300 trials he obtained only an average of 7.
This is lower than his usual average of 9.5 to 10, due in part perhaps
to difficulty in adjusting himself to new conditions; this may be all
the harder with the observer right in the same room than with him off
with the cards 100 yards away. But, at any rate, distance does not
matter in this mode of perception, so far as these results go to
indicate. Then the cards were taken to the Duke Medical Building, with
over 250 yards between cards and percipient. Again there was the
low-scoring adjustment period at first. This lasted over more runs this
time but was followed by good scoring, which is now going on daily at
this distance. After a time the distance will be still further extended.

These long distance results with P.C. were most crucially appropriate,
as will be seen later in the report. The point was that with P.T. we
already had the distance test successfully met. We are keenly searching
for possible differences and similarities. This was then the point on
which eager interest strongly focused.

But what will distance do to D.T.? Can the remarkable acuity and
precision of this type be achieved at a distance too? Distance D.T. did
not succeed in the Pearce-Stuart series but, then, neither did the B.T.,
for that matter! I need not say that this point will be followed up with
vigorous interest.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_74"></span>[74:1](esp14.htm#fr_74.md) "Wallace the Magician"
(Wallace Lee) was asked to work under these conditions, after watching
Pearce work. He did not score above mean chance expectation, and frankly
admitted that he did not see how Pearce did.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[75:1](esp14.htm#fr_75.md) The striking data
obtained lately with Pearce at some distance from the cards (100 yards,
for example) may be taken as perhaps a further step.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[76:1](esp14.htm#fr_76.md) Another major subject
offers an exception to the rule evidenced in this table. Miss Turner,
whose work will be given in Chapter 8, once went to Dr. E., one of her
sceptical teachers on the campus, and offered to demonstrate E.S.P. to
him. She ran 100 trials with Dr. E. holding the cards behind a notebook
and got scores of 8, 11, 7, 7, which gives a deviation of 13 or 5 times
the p.e. Dr. E. gave me an independent confirmation of the
demonstration. This is exceptional, and is due, I think, to the fact
that she proposed the venture herself and that she did not stand in awe
of Dr. E.
