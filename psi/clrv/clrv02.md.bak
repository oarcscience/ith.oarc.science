### CHAPTER I

#### WHAT CLAIRVOYANCE IS

Clairvoyance means literally nothing more than "clear seeing", and it is
a word which has been sorely misused, and even degraded so far as to be
employed to describe the trickery of a mountebank in a variety show.
Even in its more restricted sense it covers a wide range of phenomena,
differing so greatly in character that it is not easy to give a
definition of the word which shall be at once succinct and accurate. It
has been called "spiritual vision", but no rendering could well be more
misleading than that, for in the vast majority of cases there is no
faculty connected with it which has the slightest claim to be honoured
by so lofty a name.

For the purpose of this treatise we may, perhaps, define it as the power
to see what is hidden from ordinary physical sight. It will be as well
to premise that it is very frequently

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (though by no
means always) accompanied by what is called clairaudience, or the power
to hear what would be inaudible to the ordinary physical ear; and we
will for the nonce take our title as covering this faculty also, in
order to avoid the clumsiness of perpetually using two long words where
one will suffice.

Let me make two points clear before I begin. First, I am not writing for
those who do not believe that there is such a thing as clairvoyance, nor
am I seeking to convince those who are in doubt about the matter. In so
small a work as this I have no space for that; such people must study
the many books containing lists of cases, or make experiments for
themselves along mesmeric lines. I am addressing myself to the
better-instructed class who know that clairvoyance exists, and are
sufficiently interested in the subject to be glad of information as to
its methods and possibilities; and I would assure them that what I write
is the result of much careful study and experiment, and that though some
of the powers which I shall have to describe may seem new and wonderful
to

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

them, I mention no single one of which I have not myself seen examples.

Secondly, though I shall endeavour to avoid technicalities as far as
possible, yet as I am writing in the main for students of Theosophy, I
shall feel myself at liberty sometimes to use, for brevity's sake and
without detailed explanation, the ordinary Theosophical terms with which
I may safely assume them to be familiar.

Should this document fall into the hands of any to whom the occasional
use of such terms constitutes a difficulty, I can only apologize to them
and refer them for these preliminary explanations to any elementary
Theosophical work, such as Mrs. Besant's *Ancient Wisdom* or *Man and
His Bodies*. The truth is that the whole Theosophical system hangs
together so closely, and its various parts are so interdependent, that
to give a full explanation of every term used would necessitate an
exhaustive treatise on Theosophy as a preface even to this short account
of clairvoyance.

Before a detailed explanation of clairvoyance can usefully be attempted,
however, it

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

will be necessary for us to devote a little time to some preliminary
considerations, in order that we may have clearly in mind a few broad
facts as to the different planes on which clairvoyant vision may be
exercised, and the conditions which renders its exercise possible.

We are constantly assured in Theosophical literature that all these
higher faculties are presently to be the heritage of mankind in
general—that the capacity of clairvoyance, for example, lies latent in
every one, and those in whom it already manifests itself are simply in
that one particular a little in advance of the rest of us. Now this
statement is a true one, and yet it seems quite vague and unreal to the
majority of people, simply because they regard such a faculty as
something absolutely different from anything they have yet experienced,
and feel fairly confident that they themselves, at any rate, are not
within measurable distance of its development.

It may help to dispel this sense of unreality if we try to understand
that clairvoyance, like so many other things in nature is mainly a
question of vibrations, and is in fact nothing but an extension of
powers which we are all

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

using every day of our lives. We are living all the while surrounded by
a vast sea of mingled air and ether, the latter interpenetrating the
former, as it does all physical matter; and it is chiefly by means of
vibrations in that vast sea of matter that impressions reach us from the
outside. This much we all know, but it may perhaps never have occurred
to many of us that the number of these vibrations to which we are
capable of responding is in reality quite infinitesimal.

Up among the exceedingly rapid vibrations which affect the ether there
is a certain small section—a *very* small section—to which the retina of
the human eye is capable of responding, and these particular vibrations
produce in us the sensation which we call light. That is to say, we are
capable of seeing only those objects from which light of that particular
kind can either issue or be reflected.

In exactly the same way the tympanum of the human ear is capable of
responding to a certain very small range of comparatively slow
vibrations—slow enough to affect the air which surrounds us and so the
only sounds which we can hear are those made by objects

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

which are able to vibrate at some rate within that particular range.

In both cases it is a matter perfectly well known to science that there
are large numbers of vibrations both above and below these two sections,
and that consequently there is much light that we cannot see, and there
are many sounds to which our ears are deaf. In these case of light the
action of these higher and lower vibrations is easily perceptible in the
effects produced by the actinic rays at one end of the spectrum and the
heat rays at the other.

As a matter of fact there exist vibrations of every conceivable degree
of rapidity, filling the whole vast space intervening between the slow
sound waves and the swift light waves; nor is even that all, for there
are undoubtedly vibrations slower than those of sound, and a whole
infinity of them which are swifter than those know to us as light. So we
begin to understand that the vibrations by which we see and hear are
only like two tiny groups of a few strings selected from an enormous
harp of practically infinite extent, and when we think how much we have
been able to learn

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

and infer from the use of those minute fragments, we see vaguely what
possibilities might lie before us if we were enabled to utilize the vast
and wonderful whole.

Another fact which needs to be considered in this connection is that
different human beings vary considerably, though within relatively
narrow limits, in their capacity of response even to the very few
vibrations which are within reach of our physical senses. I am not
referring to the keenness of sight or of hearing that enables one man to
see a fainter object or hear a slighter sound than another; it is not in
the lest a question of strength of vision, but of extent of
susceptibility.

For example, if anyone will take a good bisulphide-of-carbon prism, and
by its means throw a clear spectrum on a sheet of white paper, and then
get a number of people to mark upon the paper the extreme limits of the
spectrum as it appears to them, he is fairly certain to find that their
powers of vision differ appreciably. Some will see the violet extending
much farther than the majority do; others will perhaps see rather less
violet than

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

most, while gaining a corresponding extension of vision at the red end.
Some few there will perhaps be who can see farther than ordinary at both
ends, and these will almost certainly be what we call sensitive
people—susceptible in fact to a great range of vibrations than are most
men of the present day.

In hearing, the same difference can be tested by taking some sound which
is just not too high to be audible—on the very verge of audibility as it
were—and discovering how many among a given number of people re able to
hear it. The squeaks of a bat is a familiar instance of such a sound,
and experiment will show that on a summer evening, when the whole air is
full of the shrill, needle-like cries of these little animals, quite a
large number of men will be absolutely unconscious of them, and unable
to hear anything at all.

Now these examples clearly show that there is no hard-and-fast limit to
man's power of response to either etheric or aerial vibrations, but that
some among us already have that power to a wider extent than others; and
it will even be found that the same man's capacity varies on different
occasions. It is

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

therefore not difficult for us to imagine that it might be possible for
a man to develop this power, and thus in time to learn to see much that
is invisible to his fellow-men, and hear much that is inaudible to them,
since we know perfectly well that enormous numbers of these additional
vibrations do exist, and are simply, as it were, awaiting recognition.

The experiments with the Röntgen rays give us an example of the
startling results which are produced when even a very few of these
additional vibrations are brought within human ken, and the transparency
to these rays of many substances hitherto considered opaque at once
shows us one way at least in which we may explain such elementary
clairvoyance as is involved in reading a letter inside a closed box, or
describing those present in an adjoining apartment. To learn to see by
means of the Röntgen rays in addition to those ordinarily employed would
be quite sufficient to enable anyone to perform a feat of magic of this
order.

So far we have thought only of an extension of the purely physical
senses of man; and when we remember that a man's etheric

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

body is in reality merely the finer part of his physical frame, and that
therefore all his sense-organs contain a large amount of etheric matter
of various degrees of density, the capacities of which are still
practically latent in most of us, we shall see that even if we confine
ourselves to this line of development alone there are enormous
possibilities of all kinds already opening out before us.

But besides and beyond all this we know that man possesses an astral and
a mental body, each of which can in process of time be aroused into
activity, and will respond in turn to the vibrations of the matter of
its own plane, thus opening up before the Ego, as he learns to function
through these vehicles, two entirely new and far wider worlds of
knowledge and power. Now these new worlds, though they are all around us
and freely interpenetrate one another, are not to be thought of as
distinct and entirely unconnected in substance, but rather as melting
the one into the other, the lowest astral forming a direct

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

series with the highest physical, just as the lowest mental in its turn
forms a direct series with the highest astral. We are not called upon in
thinking of them to imagine some new and strange kind of matter, but
simply to think of the ordinary physical kind as subdivided so very much
more finely and vibrating so very much more rapidly as to introduce us
to what are practically entirely new conditions and qualities.

It is not then difficult for us to grasp the possibility of a steady and
progressive extension of our senses, so that both by sight and by
hearing we may be able to appreciate vibrations far higher and far lower
than those which are ordinarily recognized. A large section of these
additional vibrations will still belong to the physical plane, and will
merely enable us to obtain impressions from the etheric part of that
plane, which is at present as a closed book to us. Such impressions will
still be received through the retina of the eye; of course they will
affect its etheric rather than its solid matter, but we may nevertheless
regard them as still appealing only to an organ specialized to receive
them, and not to the whole surface of the etheric body.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

There are some abnormal cases, however, in which other parts of the
etheric body respond to these additional vibrations as readily as, or
even more readily than, the eye. Such vagaries are explicable in various
ways, but principally as effects of some partial astral development, for
it will be found that the sensitive pats of the body almost invariably
correspond with one or other of the *chakrams*, or centres of vitality
in the astral body. And though, if astral consciousness be not yet
developed, these centres may not be available on their own plane, they
are still strong enough to stimulate into keener activity the etheric
matter which they interpenetrate.

When we come to deal with the astral senses themselves the methods of
working are very different. The astral body has not specialized
sense-organs—a fact which perhaps needs some explanation, since many
students who are trying to comprehend its physiology seem to find it
difficult to reconcile with the statements that have been made as to the
perfect interpenetration of the physical body by astral matter, the
exact correspondence between the two vehicles and the fact that

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

every physical object has necessarily its astral counterpart.

Now all these statements are true, and yet it is quite possible for
people who do not normally see astrally to misunderstand them. Every
order of physical matter has its corresponding order of astral matter in
constant association with it—not to be separated from it except by a
very considerable exertion of occult force, and even then only to be
held apart from it as long as force is being definitely exerted to that
end. But for all that the relation of the astral particles one to
another is far looser than is the case with their physical
correspondences.

In a bar of iron, for example, we have a mass of physical molecules in
the solid condition—that is to say, capable of comparatively little
change in their relative positions, though each vibrating with immense
rapidity in its own sphere. The astral counterpart of this consists of
what we often call solid astral matter—that is, matter of the lowest and
densest sub-plane of the astral; but nevertheless its particles are
constantly and rapidly changing their relative positions, moving

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

among one another as easily as those of a liquid on the physical plane
might do. So that there is no permanent association between any one
physical particle and that amount of astral matter which happens at any
given moment to be acting as its counter part.

This is equally true with respect to the astral body of man, which for
our purpose at the moment we may regard as consisting of two parts—the
denser aggregation which occupies the exact position of the physical
body, and the cloud of rarer astral matter which surrounds that
aggregation. In both these parts, and between them both, there is going
on at every moment of time the rapid inter-circulation of the particles
which has been described, so that as one watches the movement of the
molecules in the astral body one is reminded of the appearance of those
in fiercely boiling water.

This being so, it will be readily understood that though any given organ
of the physical body must always have as its counterpart a certain
amount of astral matter, it does not retain the same particles for more
than a few

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

seconds at a time, and consequently there is nothing corresponding to
the specialization of physical nerve-matter into optic or auditory
nerves, and so on. So that though the physical eye or ear has
undoubtedly always its counterpart of astral matter, that particular
fragment of astral matter is no more (and no less) capable of responding
to the vibrations which produce astral sight or astral hearing than any
other part of the vehicle.

It must never be forgotten that though we constantly have to speak of
"astral sight" or "astral hearing" in order to make ourselves
intelligible, all that we mean by those expressions is the faculty of
responding to such vibrations as convey to the man's consciousness, when
he is functioning in his astral body, information of the same character
as that conveyed to him by his eyes and ears while he is in the physical
body. But in the entirely different astral conditions, specialized
organs are not necessary for the attainment of this result; there is
matter in every part of the astral body which is capable of such
response, and consequently the man functioning in that vehicle sees
equally well objects behind

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

him, beneath him, above him, without needing to turn his head.

There is, however, another point which it would hardly be fair to leave
entirely out of account, and that is the question of the *chakrams*
referred to above. Theosophical students are familiar with the idea of
the existence in both the astral and the etheric bodies of man of
certain centres of force which have to vivified in turn by the sacred
serpent-fire as the man advances in evolution. Though these cannot be
described as organs in the ordinary sense of the word, since it is not
through them that the man sees and hears, as he does in physical life
through eyes and ears, yet it is apparently very largely upon their
vivification that the power of exercising these astral senses depends
each of them as it is developed giving to the whole astral body the
power of response to a new set of vibrations.

Neither have these centres, however, any permanent collection of astral
matter connected with them. They are simply vortices in the matter of
the body—vortices through which all these particles pass in turn—points,

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

perhaps, at which the higher force from planes above impinges upon the
astral body. Even this description gives but a very partial idea of
their appearance, for they are in reality four dimensional vortices, so
that the force which comes through them and is the cause of their
existence seems to well up from nowhere. But at any rat, since all
particles in turn pass through each of them, it will be clear that it is
thus possible for each in turn to evoke in all the particles of the body
the power of receptivity to a certain set of vibrations, so that all the
astral senses are equally active in all parts of the body.

The vision of the mental plane is again totally different, for in this
case we can no longer speak of separate senses such as sight and
hearing, but rather have to postulate one general sense which responds
so fully to the vibrations reaching it that, when any object comes
within its cognition, it at once comprehends it fully, and as it were
sees it, hears it, feels it, and knows all there is to know about it by
the one instantaneous operation. Yet even this wonderful faculty differs
in degree only and not in kind from those which

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

are at our command at the present time; one the mental plane, just as on
the physical impressions are still conveyed by means of vibrations
travelling from the object seen to the seer.

On the buddhic plane we meet for the first time with a quite new faculty
having nothing in common with those of which we have spoken, for there a
man cognizes any object by an entirely different method, in which
external vibrations play no part. The object becomes part of himself,
and he studies it from the inside instead of from the outside. But with
*this* power ordinary clairvoyance has nothing to do.

The development, either entire or partial, of any one of these faculties
would come under our definition of clairvoyance—the power to see what is
hidden from ordinary physical sight. But these faculties may be
developed in various ways, and it will be well to say a few words as to
these different lines.

We may presume that if it were possible for a man to be isolated during
his evolution from all but the gentlest outside influences, and to
unfold from the beginning in

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

perfectly regular and normal fashion, he would probably develop his
senses in regular order also. He would find his physical senses
gradually extending their scope until they responded to all the physical
vibrations, of etheric as well as of denser matter; then in orderly
sequence would come sensibility to the coarser part of the astral plane,
and presently the finer part also would be included, until in due course
the faculty of the mental plane dawned in its turn.

In real life, however, development so regular as this is hardly ever
known, and many a man has occasional flashes of astral consciousness
without any awakening of etheric vision at all. And this irregularity of
development is one of the principal causes of man's extraordinary
liability to error in matters of clairvoyance—a liability from which
there is no escape except by a long course of careful training under a
qualified teacher.

Students of Theosophical literature are well aware that there are such
teachers to be found—that even in this materialistic nineteenth century
the old saying is still true, that "when the pupil is ready, the Master
is ready

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

also" and that "in the hall of learning, when he is capable of entering
there, the disciple will always find his Master." They are well aware
also that only under such guidance can a man develop his latent powers
in safety and with certainty, since they know how fatally easy it is for
the untrained clairvoyant to deceive himself as to the meaning and value
of what he sees, or even absolutely to distort his vision completely in
bringing it down into his physical consciousness.

It does not follow that even the pupil who is receiving regular
instruction in the use of occult powers will find them unfolding
themselves exactly in the regular order which was suggested above as
probably idea. His previous progress may not have been such as to make
this for him the easiest or most desirable road; but at any rate he is
in the hands of one who is perfectly competent to be his guide in
spiritual development, and he rests in perfect contentment that the way
along which he is taken will be that which is the best way for him.

Another great advantage which he gains is that whatever faculties he may
acquire are

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

definitely under his command and can be used fully and constantly when
he needs them for his Theosophical work; whereas in the case of the
untrained man such powers often manifest themselves only very partially
and spasmodically, and appear to come and go, as it were, at their own
sweet will.

It may reasonably be objected that if clairvoyant faculty is, as stated,
a part of the occult development of man, and so a sign of a certain
amount of progress along that line, it seems strange that it should
often be possessed by primitive peoples, or by the ignorant and
uncultured among our own race—persons who are obviously quite
undeveloped, from whatever point of view one regards them. No doubt this
does appear remarkable at first sight; but the fact is that the
sensitiveness o the savage or of the coarse and vulgar European
ignoramus is not really at all the same thing as the faculty of his
properly trained brother, nor is it arrived at in the same way.

An exact and detailed explanation of the difference would lead us into
rather recondite technicalities, but perhaps the general idea of the
distinction between the two may be

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

caught from an example taken from the very lowest plane of clairvoyance,
in close contact with the denser physical. The etheric double in man is
in exceedingly close relation to his nervous system, and any kind of
action upon one of them speedily reacts on the other. Now in the
sporadic appearance of etheric sight in the savage, whether of Central
Africa or of Western Europe, it has been observed that the corresponding
nervous disturbance is almost entirely in the sympathetic system, and
that the whole affair is practically beyond the man's control—is in fact
a sort of massive sensation vaguely belonging to the whole etheric body,
rather than an exact and definite sense-perception communicated through
a specialized organ.

As in later races and amid higher development the strength of the man is
more and more thrown into the evolution of the mental faculties, this
vague sensitiveness usually disappears; but still later, when the
spiritual man begins to unfold, he regains his clairvoyant power. This
time, however, the faculty is a precise and exact one, under the control
of the man's will, and exercised

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

through a definite sense-organ; and it is noteworthy that any nervous
action set up in sympathy with it is now almost exclusively in the
cerebro-spinal system.

On this subject Mrs. Besant writes: "The lower forms of psychism are
more frequent in animals and in very unintelligent human beings than in
men and women in whom the intellectual powers are well developed. They
appear to be connected with the sympathetic system, not with the
cerebro-spinal. The large nucleated ganglionic cells in this system
contain a very large proportion of etheric matter, and are hence more
easily affected by the coarser astral vibrations than are the cells in
which the proportion is less. As the cerebro-spinal system develops, and
the brain becomes more highly evolved, the sympathetic system subsides
into a subordinate position, and the sensitiveness to psychic vibrations
is dominated by the stronger and more active vibrations of the higher
nervous system It is true that at a later stage of evolution psychic
sensitiveness reappears but it is then developed in connection with the
cerebro-spinal

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

centres, and is brought under the control of the will. But the
hysterical and ill-regulated psychism of which we see so many lamentable
examples is due to the small development of the brain and the dominance
of the sympathetic system."

Occasional flashes of clairvoyance do, however, sometimes come to the
highly cultured and spiritual-minded man, even though he may never have
heard of the possibility of training such a faculty. In his case such
glimpses usually signify that he is approaching that stage in his
evolution when these powers will naturally begin to manifest themselves,
and their appearance should serve as an additional stimulus to him
strive to maintain that high standard of moral purity and mental balance
without which clairvoyance is a curse and not a blessing to its
possessor.

Between those who are entirely unimpressible and those who are in full
possession of clairvoyant power there are many intermediate stages. One
to which it will be worth while to give a passing glance is the stage in
which a man, though he has no clairvoyant faculty in ordinary life, yet
exhibits it more or less

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

fully under the influence of mesmerism. This is a case in which the
psychic nature is already sensitive, but the consciousness is not yet
capable of functioning in it amidst the manifold distractions of
physical life. It needs to be set free by the temporary suspension of
the outer senses in the mesmeric trance before it can use the diviner
faculties which are but just beginning to dawn within it. But of course
even in the mesmeric trance there are innumerable degrees of lucidity,
from the ordinary patient who is blankly unintelligent to the man whose
power of sight is fully under the control of the operator, and can be
directed whithersoever he wills, or to the more advanced stage in which,
when the consciousness is once set free, it escapes altogether from the
grasp of the magnetizer, and soars into fields of exalted vision where
it is entirely beyond his reach.

Another step along the same path is that upon which such perfect
suppression of the physical as that which occurs in the hypnotic trance
is not necessary, but the power of supernormal sight, though still out
of reach during waking life, becomes available when

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

the body is held in the bonds of ordinary sleep. At this stage of
development stood many of the prophets and seers of whom we read, who
were "warned of God in a dram", or communed with beings far higher than
themselves in the silent watches of the night.

Most cultured people of the higher races of the world have this
development to some extent: that is to say, the senses of their astral
bodies are in full working order, and perfectly capable of receiving
impressions from objects and entities of their own plane. But to make
that fact of any use to them down here in the physical body, two changes
are usually necessary: first, that the Ego shall be awakened to the
realities of the astral plane, and induced to emerge from the chrysalis
formed by his own waking thoughts, and look round him to observe and to
learn; and secondly, that the consciousness shall be so far retained
during the return of the Ego into his physical body as to enable him to
impress upon his physical brain the recollection of what he has seen or
learnt.

If the first of these changes has taken place, the second is of little
importance, since the

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ego, the true man,
will be able to profit by the information to be obtained upon that
plane, even though he may not have the satisfaction of bringing through
any remembrance of it into his waking life down here.

Students often ask how this clairvoyant faculty will first be manifested
in themselves—how they may know when they have reached the stage at
which its first faint foreshadowings are beginning to be visible. Cases
differ so widely that it is impossible to give to this question any
answer that will be universally applicable.

Some people begin by a plunge, as it were, and under some unusual
stimulus become able just for once to see some striving vision; and very
often in such a case, because the experience does not repeat itself, the
seer comes in time to believe that on that occasion he must have been
the victim of hallucination. Others begin by becoming intermittently
conscious of the brilliant colours and vibrations of the human aura; yet
others find themselves with increasing frequency seeing and hearing
something to which those around them are blind and deaf; others, again,
see

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

faces, landscapes, or coloured clouds floating before their eyes in the
dark before they sink to rest; while perhaps the commonest experience of
all is that of those who begin to recollect with greater and greater
clearness what they have seen and heard on the other planes during
sleep.

Having now to some extent cleared our ground, we may proceed to consider
the various phenomena of clairvoyance.

They differ so widely both in character and in degree that it is not
very easy to decide how they can most satisfactorily be classified. We
might, for example, arrange them according to the kind of sight
employed—whether it were mental, astral, or merely etheric. We might
divine them according to the capacity of the clairvoyant, taking into
consideration whether he was trained or untrained; whether his vision
was regular and under his command, or spasmodic and independent of his
volition; whether he could exercise it only when under mesmeric
influence, or whether that assistance was unnecessary for him; whether
he was able to use his faculty when awake in the physical body, or
whether

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

it was available only when he was temporarily away from that body in
sleep or trance.

All these distinctions are of importance, and we shall have to take them
all into consideration as we go on, but perhaps on the whole the most
useful classification will be one something on the lines of that adopted
by Mr. Sinnett in his *Rational of Mesmerism*—a book, by the way, which
all students of clairvoyance ought to read. In dealing with the
phenomena, then, we will arrange them rather according to the capacity
of the sight employed than to the plane upon which it is exercised, so
that we may group instances of clairvoyance under some such headings as
these:

1\. Simple clairvoyance—that is to say, a mere opening of sight,
enabling its possessor to see whatever astral or etheric entities happen
to be present around him, but not including the power of observing
either distance places or scenes belonging to any other time than the
present.

2\. Clairvoyance in space—the capacity to see scenes or events removed
from the seer in space, and either too far distant for

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

ordinary observation or concealed by intermediate objects.

3\. Clairvoyance in time—that is to say, the capacity to see objects or
events which are removed from the seer in time, or, in other words, the
