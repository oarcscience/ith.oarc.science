### CHAPTER VIII

#### CLAIRVOYANCE IN TIME: THE FUTURE

Even if, in a dim sort of way, we feel ourselves able to grasp the idea
that the whole of the past may be simultaneously and actively present in
a sufficiently exalted consciousness, we are confronted by a far greater
difficulty when we endeavour to realize how all the future may also be
comprehended in that consciousness. If we could believe in the
Mohammedan doctrine of kismet, or the Calvinistic theory of
predestination, the conception would be easy enough, but knowing as we
do that both these are grotesque distortions of the truth, we must look
round for a more acceptable hypothesis.

There may still be some people who deny the possibility of prevision,
but such denial simply shows their ignorance of the evidence

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

on the subject. The large number of authenticated cases leaves no room
for doubt as to the fact, but many of them are of such a nature as to
render a reasonable explanation by no means easy to find. It is evident
that the Ego possesses a certain amount of previsional faculty, and if
the events foreseen were always of great importance, one might suppose
that an extraordinary stimulus had enabled him for that occasion only to
make a clear impression of what he saw upon his lower personality. No
doubt that is the explanation of many of the cases in which death or
grave disaster is foreseen, but there are a large number of instances on
record to which it does not seem to apply, since the events foretold are
frequently exceedingly trivial and unimportant.

A well-know story of second-sight in Scotland will illustrate when I
mean. A man who had no belief in the occult was forewarned by a Higher
seer of the approaching death of a neighbour. The prophecy was given
with considerable wealth of detail, including a full description of the
funeral, with the names of the four pallbearers and others who

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

would be present. The auditor seems to have laughed at the whole story
and promptly forgotten it, but the death of his neighbour at the time
foretold recalled the warning to mind, and he determined to falsify part
of the prediction at any rate by being one of the pallbearers himself.
He succeeded in getting matters arranged as he wished, but just as the
funeral was about to start he was called away from his post by some
small matter which detained him only a minute or two. As he came
hurrying back he saw with surprise that the procession had started
without him, and that the prediction had been exactly fulfilled, for the
four pallbearers were those who had been indicated in the vision.

Now here is a very trifling matter, which could have been of no possible
importance to anybody, definitely foreseen months beforehand; and
although a man makes a determined effort to alter the arrangement
indicated he fails entirely to affect it in the least. Certainly this
looks very much like predestination, even down to the smallest detail,
and it is only when we examine this question from higher planes that we
are able to see our

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

way to escape that theory. Of course, as I said before about another
branch of the subject, a full explanation eludes us as yet, and
obviously must do so until our knowledge is infinitely greater than it
is now; the most that we can hope to do for the present is to indicate
the line along which an explanation may be found.

There is no doubt whatever that, just as what is happening now is the
result of causes set in motion in the past, so what will happen in the
future will be the result of causes already in operation. Even down here
we can calculate that if certain actions are performed certain results
will follow, but our reckoning is constantly liable to be disturbed by
the interference of factors which we have not been able to take into
account. But if we raise our consciousness to the mental plane we can
see very much farther into the results of our actions.

We can trace, for example, the effect of a casual word, not only upon
the person to whom it was addressed, but through him on many others as
it is passed on in widening circles, until it seems to have affected the

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

whole country; and one glimpse of such a vision is far more efficient
than any number of moral precepts in pressing upon us the necessity of
extreme circumspection in thought, word, and deed. Not only can we from
that plane see thus fully the result of every action, but we can also
see where and in what way the results of other actions apparently quite
unconnected with it will interfere with and modify it. In fact, it may
be said that the results of all causes at present in action are clearly
visible—that the future, as it would be if no entirely new causes should
arise, lies open before our gaze.

New causes of course do arise, because man's will is free; but in the
case of all ordinary people the use which they will make of their
freedom can be calculated beforehand with considerable accuracy. The
average man has so little real will that he is very much the creature of
circumstances; his action impervious lives places him amid certain
surroundings, and their influence upon him is so very much the most
important factor in his life-story that his future course may be
predicted with almost mathematical certainty.

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> With the developed
man the case is different; for him also the main events of life are
arranged by his past actions, but the way in which he will allow them to
affect him, the methods by which he will deal with them and perhaps
triumph over them—these are all his own, and they cannot be foreseen
even on the mental plane except as probabilities.

Looking down on man's life in this way from above, it seems as though
his free will could be exercised only at certain crises in his career.
He arrives at a point in his life where there are obviously two or three
alternative courses open before him; he is absolutely free to choose
which of them he pleases, and although someone who knew his nature
thoroughly well might feel almost certain what his choice would be, such
knowledge on his friend's part is in no sense a compelling force.

But when he *has* chosen, he has to go through with it and take the
consequences; having entered upon a particular path he may, in many
cases, be forced to go on for a very long way before he has ay
opportunity to

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

turn aside. His position is somewhat like that of the driver of a train;
when he comes to a junction he may have the points set either this way
or that, and so can pass on to whichever line he pleases, but when he
has passed on to one of them he is compelled to run on along the line
which he has selected until he reaches another set of points, where
again an opportunity of choice is offered to him.

Now, in looking down from the mental plane, these points of new
departure would be clearly visible, and all the results of each choice
would like open before us, certain to be worked out even to the smallest
detail. The only point which would remain uncertain would be the
all-important one as to which choice the man would make. We should, in
fact, have not one but several futures mapped out before our eyes,
without necessarily being able to determine which of them would
materialize itself into accomplished fact. In most instances we should
see so throng a probability that we should not hesitate to come to a
decision, but the case which I have described is certain theoretically
possible. Still, even this much knowledge

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

would enable us to do with safety a good deal of prediction; and it is
not difficult for us to imagine that a far higher power than ours might
always be able to foresee which way every choice would go, and
consequently to prophesy with absolute certainty.

On the buddhic plane, however, no such elaborate process of conscious
calculation is necessary, for, as I said before, in some manner which
down here is totally inexplicable, the past, the present, and the future
are there al existing simultaneously. One can only accept this fact, for
its cause lies in the faculty of the plane, and the way in which this
higher faculty works is naturally quite incomprehensible to the physical
brain. Yet now and then one may meet with a hint that seems to bring us
a trifle nearer to a dim possibility of comprehension. One such hint was
given by Sir Olive Lodge in his address to the British Association at
Cardiff. He said;

"A luminous and helpful idea is that time is but a relative mode of
regarding things; we progress through phenomena at a certain definite
pace and this subjective advance we

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

interpret in an objective manner, as if events moved necessarily in this
order and at this precise rate. But that may be only one mode of
regarding them. The events may be in some sense in existence always,
both past and future, and it may be we who are arriving at them, not
they which happening. The analogy of a traveller in a railway train is
useful; if he could never leave the train nor alter its pace he would
probably consider the landscapes as necessarily successive and be unable
to conceive their coexistence... We perceive, therefore, a possible
fourth dimensional aspect about time, the inexorableness of whose flow
may be a natural part of our present limitations. And if we once grasp
the idea that past and future may be actually existing, we can recognize
that they may have a controlling influence on all present action, and
the two together may constitute the 'higher plane' or totality of things
after which, as it seems to me, we are impelled to seek, in connection
with the directing of form or determinism, and the action of living
beings consciously directed to a definite and preconceived end."

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

Time is not in reality the fourth dimension at all; yet to look at it
for the moment from that point of view is some slight help towards
grasping the ungraspable. Suppose that we hold a wooden cone at right
angles to a sheet of paper, and slowly push it through its point first.
A microbe living on the surface of that sheet of paper, and having no
power of conceiving anything outside of that surface, could not only
never see the cone as a whole, but could form no sort of conception of
such a body at all. All that he would see would be the sudden appearance
of a tiny circle, which would gradually and mysteriously grow larger and
larger until it vanished from his world as suddenly and incomprehensibly
as it had come into it.

Thus, what were in reality a series of sections of the cone would appear
to him to be successive stages in the life of a circle, and it would be
impossible for him to grasp the idea that these successive stages could
be seen simultaneously. Yet it is, of course, easy enough for us,
looking down upon the transaction from another dimension, to see that
the microbe is simply under a delusion arising

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

from its own limitations, and that the cone exists as a whole all the
while. Our own delusion as to past, present, and future is possibly not
dissimilar, and the view that is gained of sequence of events from the
buddhic plane corresponds to the view of the cone as a whole. Naturally,
any attempt to work out this suggestion lands us in a series of
startling paradoxes; but the fact remains a fact, nevertheless, and the
time will come when it will be clear as noonday to our comprehension.

When the pupil's consciousness is fully developed upon the buddhic
plane, therefore, perfect prevision is possible to him, though he may
not—nay, he certainly will not—be able to bring the whole result of this
sight through fully and in order into this light. Still, a great deal of
clear foresight is obviously within his power, however he likes to
exercise it; and even when he is not exercising it, frequent flashes of
foreknowledge come through into his ordinary life, so that he often has
an instantaneous intuition as to how things will turn out even before
their inception.

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

Short of this perfect prevision we find, as in the previous cases, that
all degrees of this type of clairvoyance exist, from the occasional
vague premonitions which cannot in any true sense be called sight at
all, up to frequent and fairly complete second-sight. The faculty to
which this latter somewhat misleading name has been given is an
extremely interesting one and would well repay more careful and
systematic study than has ever higher to been given to it.

It is best know to us as a not infrequent possession of the Scottish
Highlanders, though it is by no means confirmed to them. Occasional
instances of it have appeared in almost every nation, but it has always
been commonest among mountaineers and men of lonely life. With us in
England it is often spoken of as though it were the exclusive appanage
of the Celtic race, but in reality it has appeared among similarly
situated peoples the world over. It is stated, for example, to be very
common among the Westphalian peasantry.

Sometimes the second-sight consists of a picture clearly foreshowing
some coming

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

event; more frequently, perhaps, the glimpse of the future is given by
some symbolical appearance. It is noteworthy that the events foreseen
are invariably unpleasant ones—death being the commonest of all; I do
not recollect a single instance in which the second-sight has shown
anything which was not of the most gloomy nature. It has a ghastly
symbolism which is all its own—a symbolism of shrouds and
corpse-candles, and other funereal horrors. In some cases it appears to
be to a certain extent dependent on locality, for it is state that
inhabitants of the Isle of Skye who possess the faulty often lose it
when they leave the island, even though it be only to cross to the
mainland. The gift of such sight is sometimes hereditary in a family for
generations, but this is not an invariable rule, for it often appears
sporadically in one member of a family otherwise free from its
lugubrious influence.

An example in which an accurate vision of a coming even was seen some
months beforehand by second-sight has already been given. Here is
another and perhaps a more striking one, which I give exactly as it was

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

related to me by one of the actors in the scene.

"We plunged into the jungle, and had walked on for about an hour without
much success, when Cameron, who happened to be next to me, stopped
suddenly, turned pale as death, and, pointing straight before him, cried
in accents of horror:

"'See! see! merciful heaven, look there!'

"'Where? what? what is it?' we all shouted confusedly, as we rushed up
to him and looked round in expectation of encountering a tiger—a
cobra—we hardly knew what, but assuredly something terrible, since it
had been sufficient to cause such evident emotion in our usually
self-contained comrade. But neither tiger nor cobra was visible—nothing
but Cameron pointing with ghastly, haggard face and staring eyeballs at
something we could not see.

"'Cameron! Cameron!' cried I, seizing his arm, 'for heaven's sake,
speak! What is the matter?'

"Scarcely were the words out of my mouth when a low, but very peculiar
sound struck on my ear, and Cameron, dropping his pointing

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

hand, said in a hoarse, strained voice, 'There! you heard it? Thank God
it's over!' and fell to the ground insensible.

"There was a momentary confusion while we unfastened his collard, and I
dashed in his face some water which I fortunately had in my flask, while
another tried to pour brandy between his clenched teeth; and under cover
of it whispered to the man next to me (one of our greatest sceptics, by
the way), 'Beauchamp, did *you* hear anything?'

"'Why, yes,' he replied, 'a curious sound, very; a sort of crash or
rattle far away in the distance, yet very distinct; if the thing were
not utterly impossible, I could have sworn it was the rattle of
musketry'.

"'Just my impression', murmured I; 'but hush! he is recovering'.

"In a minute or two he was able to speak feebly, and began to thank us
and apologize for giving trouble; and soon he sat up, leaning against a
tree, and in a firm, though still low voice said:

"'My dear friends, I feel I owe you an explanation of my extraordinary
behaviour. It is an explanation that I would fain avoid

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

giving; but it must come some time, and so may as well be given now. You
may perhaps have noticed that when during our voyage you all join in
scoffing at dreams, portents and visions, I invariably avoided giving
any opinion on the subject. I did so because, while I had no desire to
court ridicule or provoke discussion, I was unable to agree with you
knowing only too well from my own dread experience that the world which
men agree to call that of the supernatural is just as real as—nay,
perhaps, even far more real than—this world we see about us. In other
words, I, like many of my country men, am cursed with the gift of
second-sight—that awful faculty which foretells in vision calamities
that are shortly to occur'.

"'Such a vision I had just now, and its exceptional horror moved me as
you have seen. I saw before me a corpse—not that of one who has died a
peaceful natural death, but that of the victim of some terrible
accident; a ghastly, shapeless mass, with a face swollen, crushed,
unrecognisable. I saw this dreadful object placed in a coffin, and the
funeral service performed over it. I saw the

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

burial ground, I saw the clergyman; and though I had never seen either
before, I can picture both perfectly in my mind's eye now; I saw you,
myself, Beauchamp, all of us and many more, standing round as mourners;
I saw the soldiers raise their muskets after the service was over; I
heard the volley they fired—and then I knew no more'.

"As he spoke of that volley of musketry I glanced across with a shudder
at Beauchamp, and the look of stony horror on that handsome sceptic's
face was not to be forgotten."

This is only one incident (and by no means the principal one) in a very
remarkable story of psychic experience, but as for the moment we are
concerned merely with the example of second-sight which it gives us, I
need only say that later in the day the party of young soldiers
discovered the body of their commanding officer in the terrible
condition so graphically described by Mr. Cameron. The narrative
continues:

"When, on the following evening, we arrived at our destination, and our
melancholy deposition had been taken down by the proper authorities,
Cameron and I went out

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

for a quiet walk, to endeavour with the assistance of the soothing
influence of nature to shake off something of the gloom which paralyzed
our spirits. Suddenly he clutched my arm, and pointing through some rude
railings, said in a trembling voice. "Yes, there it is! that is the
burial-ground I saw yesterday'. And when later on we were introduced to
the chaplain of the post, I noticed, though my friends did not, the
irrepressible shudder with which Cameron took his hand, and I knew that
he had recognized the clergyman of his vision."

As for the occult rational of all this, I presume Mr. Cameron's vision
was a pure case of second-sight, and if so the fact that the two men who
were evidently nearest to him (certainly one—probably both—actually
touching him) participated in it to the limited extent of hearing the
concluding volley, while the others who were not so close did not, would
show that the intensity with which the vision impressed itself upon the
seer occasioned vibrations in his mind-body which were communicated to
those of the persons in contact with him, as in ordinary

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

thought-transference. Anyone who wishes to read the rest of the story
will find it in the pages of *Lucifer*, vol. xx, page 457.

Scores of examples of similar nature to these might easily be collected.
With regard to the symbolical variety of this sight, it is commonly
stated among those who possess it that if on meeting a living person
they see a phantom shroud wrapped around him, it is a sure
prognostication of his death. The date of the approaching decease is
indicated either by the extent to which the shroud covers the body, or
by the time of day at which the vision is seen; for if it be in the
early morning they say that the man will die during the same day, but if
it be in the evening, then it will be only some time within a year.

Another variant (and a remarkable one) of the symbolic form of
second-sight is that in which the headless apparition of the person
whose death is foretold manifests itself to the seer. An example of that
class is given in *Signs before Death* as having happened in the family
of Dr. Ferrier, though in that case, if I recollect rightly, the vision
did not occur until the time of the death, or very near it.

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

Turning from seers who are regularly in possession of a certain faculty,
although its manifestations are only occasionally fully under their
control, we are confronted by a large number of isolated instances of
prevision in the case of people with whom it is not in any way a regular
faculty. Perhaps the majority of these occur in dreams, although
examples of the waking vision are by no means wanting. Sometimes the
prevision refers to an event of distinct importance to the seer, and so
justifies the action of the Ego in taking the trouble to impress it. In
other cases, the even is one which is of no apparent importance, or is
not in any way connected with the man to whom the vision comes.
Sometimes it is clear that the intention of the Ego (or the
communicating entity, whatever it may be) is to warn the lower self of
the approach of some calamity, either in order that it may be prevented
or, if that be not possible, that the shock may be minimized by
preparation.

The even most frequently thus foreshadowed is, perhaps not unnaturally,
death—sometimes the death of the seer himself,

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

sometimes that of one dear to him. This type of prevision is so common
in the literature of the subject, and its object is so obvious, that we
need hardly cite examples of it; but one or two instances in which the
prophetic sight, though clearly useful, was yet of a less sombre
character, will prove not uninteresting to the reader. The following is
culled from that storehouse of the student of the uncanny, Mrs. Crowe's
*Night Side of Nature*, page 72.

"A few years ago Dr. Watson, now residing at Glasgow, dreamt that he
received a summons to attend a patient at a place some miles from where
he was living; that he started on horseback, and that as he was crossing
a moor he saw a bull making furiously at him, whose horns he only
escaped by taking refuge on a spot inaccessible to the animal, where he
waiting a long time till some people, observing his situation, came to
his assistance and released him.

"Whilst at breakfast on the following morning the summons came, and
smiling at the odd coincidence (as he thought it), he started on
horseback. He was quite ignorant of the road he had to go, but by and by
he

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

arrived at the moor, which he recognized, and presently the bull
appeared, coming full tilt towards him. But his dream had shown him the
place of refuge for which he instantly made, and there he spent three or
four hours, besieged by the animal, till the country people set him
free. Dr Watson declares that but for the dream he should not have known
in what direction to run for safety."

Another case, in which a much longer interval separated the warning and
its fulfillment, is given by Dr. F. G. Lee, in *Glimpses of the
Supernatural*, Volume 1, page 240.

"Mrs. Hannah Green, the housekeeper of a country family in Oxfordshire,
dreamt one night that she had been left alone in the house upon a Sunday
evening, and that hearing a knock at the door of the chief entrance she
went to it and there found an ill-looking tramp armed with a bludgeon,
who insisted on forcing himself into the house. She thought that she
struggled for some time to prevent him so doing, but quite
ineffectually, and that, being struck down by him and rendered
insensible, he thereupon gained ingress to the mansion. On this she
awoke.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

"As nothing happened for a considerable period the circumstance of the
dream was soon forgotten, and, as she herself asserts, had altogether
passed away from her mind. However, seven years afterwards this same
housekeeper was left with two other servants to take charge of an
isolated mansion at Kensington (subsequently the town residence of the
family), when on a certain Sunday evening, her fellow-servants having
gone out and left her alone, she was suddenly startled by a loud knock
at the front door.

"All of a sudden the remembrance of her former dream returned to her
with singular vividness and remarkable force, and she felt her lonely
isolation greatly. Accordingly, having at once lighted a lamp on the
hall table—during which act the loud knock was repeated with vigour—she
took the precaution to go up to a landing on the star and throw up the
window; and there to her intense terror she saw in the flesh the very
man who years previously she had seen in her dream, armed with the
bludgeon and demanding an entrance.

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

"With great presence of mind she went down to the chief entrance, made
that and other doors and windows more secure, and then rang the various
bells of the house violently, and placed lights in the upper rooms. It
was concluded that by the acts the intruder was scared away.

Evidently in this case also the dream was of practical use, as without
it the worthy housekeeper would without doubt from sheer force of habit
have opened the door in the ordinary way in answer to the knock.

It is not, however, only in dream that the Ego impresses his lower self
with what he thinks it well for it to know. Many instances showing this
might be taken from the books, but instead of quoting from them I will
give a case related only a few weeks ago by a lady of my acquaintance—a
case which, although not surrounded with any romantics incident, has at
least the merit of being new.

My friend, then, has two quite young children, and a little while ago
the elder of them caught (as was supposed) a bad cold, and suffered for
some days from a complete stoppage in the upper part of the nose. The

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

mother thought little of this, expecting it to pass off, until one day
she suddenly saw before her in the air what she describes as a picture
of a room, in the centre of which was a table on which her child was
lying insensible or dead, with some people bending over her. The
minutest details of the scene were clear to her, and she particularly
noticed that the child wore a white nightdress, whereas she knew that
all garments of that description possessed by her little daughter
happened to be pink.

The vision impressed her considerably, and suggested to her for the
first time that the child might be suffering from something more serious
than a cold, so she carried her off to a hospital for examination. The
surgeon who attended to her discovered the presence of dangerous growth
in the nose, which he pronounced must be removed. A few days later the
child was taken to the hospital for the operation, and was put to bed.
When the mother arrived at the hospital she found she had forgotten to
bring one of the child's night-dresses, and so the nurses had to supply
one, which was *white*. In this white dress

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

the operation was performed on the girl the next day, in the room that
her mother saw in her vision, every circumstance being exactly
reproduced.

In all these cases the prevision achieved its result, but the books are
full of stories of warnings neglected or scouted, and of the disaster
that consequently followed. In some cases the information is given to
someone who has practically no power to interfere in the matter, as in
the historic instance when John Williams, a Cornish mine-manager,
foresaw in the minutest detail, eight or nine days before it took place,
the assassination of Mr. Spencer Perceval, the then Chancellor of the
Exchequer, in the lobby of the House of Commons. Even in this case,
however, it is just possible that something might have been done, for we
read that Mr. Williams was so much impressed that he consulted his
friends as to whether he ought not to go up to London to warn Mr.
Perceval. Unfortunately they dissuaded him, and the assassination took
place. It does not seem very probable that, even if he had gone up to
town and related his story, much attention would have been

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

paid to him; still there is just the possibility that some precautions
might have been taken which would have prevented the murder.

There is little to show us what particular action on higher planes led
to this curious prophetic vision. The parties were entirely unknown to
one another, so that it was not caused by any close sympathy between
them. If it was an attempt made by some helper to avert the threatened
doom, it seems strange that no one who was sufficiently impressible
could be found nearer than Cornwall. Perhaps Mr. Williams, when on the
astral plane during sleep, somehow came across this reflection of the
future, and being naturally horrified thereby, passed it on to his lower
mind in the hope that somehow something might be done to prevent it; but
it is impossible to diagnose the case with certainty without examining
the ākāshic records to see what actually took place.

A typical instance of the absolutely purposeless foresight is that
related by Mr. Stead, in his *Real Ghost Stories* (page 83), of his
friend Miss Freer, commonly known as Miss X. When staying at a country
house this lady, being wide awake and fully conscious, once

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

saw a dogcart drawn by a white horse standing at the hall door, with two
strangers in it, one of whom got out of the cart and stood playing with
a terrier. She noticed that he was wearing an ulster, and also
particularly observed the fresh wheel-marks made by the cart on the
gravel. Nevertheless there was no cart there at the time; but half an
hour later two strangers *did* drive up in such an equipage, and every
detail of the lady's vision was accurately fulfilled. Mr. Stead goes on
to cite another instance of equally purposeless prevision where seven
years separated the dream (for in this case it was a dream) and its
fulfillment.

All these instances (and they are merely random selections from many
hundreds) show that a certain amount of prevision is undoubtedly
possible to the Ego, and such cases would evidently be much more
frequent if it were not for the exceeding density and lack of response
in the lower vehicles of the majority of what we call civilized
mankind—qualities chiefly attributable to the gross practical
materialism of the present age. I am not thinking of any profession of
materialistic

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

belief as common, but of the fact that in all practical affairs of daily
life nearly everyone is guided solely by considerations of worldly
interest in some shape or other.

In many cases the Ego himself may be an undeveloped one and his
prevision consequently very vague; in others he himself may see clearly
but may find his lower vehicles so unimpressible that all he can succeed
in getting through into his physical brain may be an indefinite presage
of coming disaster. Again, there are cases in which a premonition is not
the work of the Ego at all, but of some outside entity, who for some
reasons takes a friendly interest in the person to whom the feeling
comes. In the work which I quote above, Mr. Stead tells us of the
certainty which he felt many months beforehand that he would be left in
change of the *Pall Mall Gazette*, through from an ordinary point of
view nothing seemed less probable. Whether that foreknowledge was the
result of an impression made by his own Ego or of a friendly hint from
someone else it is impossible to say without definite investigation, but
his confidence in it was fully justified.

There is one more variety of clairvoyance in time which ought not to be
left without mention. It is a comparatively rare one, but there are
enough examples on record to claim our attention, though unfortunately
the particulars given do not usually include those which we should
require in order to be able to diagnose it with certainty. I refer to
the cases in which spectral armies or phantom flocks of animals have
been seen. In *The Night Side of Nature* (page 462 *et seq*.) we have
accounts of several such visions. We are there told how at Havarah Park,
near Ripley, a body of soldiers in white uniform, amounting to several
hundreds, was seen by reputable people to go through various evolutions
and then vanish; and how some years earlier a similar visionary army was
seen in the neighbourhood of Inverness by a respectable farmer and his
son.

In this case also the number of troops was very great, and the
spectators had not the slightest doubt at first that they were
substantial forms of flesh and blood. They counted at least sixteen
pairs of columns, and had abundance of time to observe every

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

particular. The front ranks marched seven abreast, and were accompanied
by a good many women and children, who were carrying tin cans and other
implements of cookery. The men were clothed in red, and their arms shone
brightly in the sun. In the midst of them was an animal, a deer or
horse, they could not distinguish which, that they were driving
furiously forward with their bayonets.

The younger of the two men observed to the other that every now and then
the rear ranks were obliged to run to overtake the van; and the elder
one, who had been a soldier, remarked that that was always the case, and
recommend him if he ever served to try to march in the front. There was
only one mounted officer; he rode a grey dragoon horse, and wore a
gold-laced hat and blue Hussar cloak, with wide open sleeves lined with
red. The two spectators observed him so particularly that they said
afterwards they should recognize him anywhere. They were, however,
afraid of being ill-treated or forced to go along with the troops, whom
they concluded to have come from Ireland, and landed at Hyntyre; and
whilst they were climbing over a dyke

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

to get out of their way, the whole thing vanished.

A phenomenon of the same sort was observed in the earlier part of this
century at Paderborn in Westphalia, and seen by at least thirty people;
but as, some years later, a review of twenty thousand men was held on
the very same spot, it was concluded that the vision must have been some
sort of second-sight—a faculty not uncommon in the district.

Such spectral hosts, however, are sometimes seen where an army of
ordinary men could by no possibility have marched, either before or
after. One of the most remarkable accounts of such apparitions is given
by Miss Harriet Martineau, in her description of *The English Lakes*.
She writes as follows:

"This Souter or Soutra Fell is the mountain on which ghosts appeared in
myriads, at intervals during ten years of the last century, presenting
the same appearances to twenty-six chosen witnesses, and to all the
inhabitants of all the cottages within view of the mountain, and for a
space of two hours and a half at one time—the spectral show being closed
by darkness! The mountain, be it remembered,

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

is full of precipices, which defy all marching of bodies of men; and the
north and west sides present a sheer perpendicular of 900 feet.

"On Midsummer Eve, 1735, a farm servant of Mr. Lancaster, half a mile
from the mountain, saw the eastern side of its summit covered with
troops, which pursued their onward march for an hour. They came,
indistinct bodies, from an eminence on the north and disappeared in a
niche in the summit. When the poor fellow told his tale, he was insulted
on all hands, as original observers usually are when they see anything
wonderful. Two years after, also on a Midsummer Eve, Mr. Lancaster saw
some men there, apparently following their horses, as if they had
returned from hunting. He thought nothing of this; but he happened to
look up again ten minutes after, and saw the figures, now mounted, and
followed by an interminable array of troops, five abreast, marching from
the eminence and over the cleft as before. All the family saw this, and
the manœuvres of the force, as each company was kept in order by a
mounted officer, who

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

galloped this way and that. As the shades of twilight came on, the
disciple appeared to relax, and the troops intermingled, and rode at
unequal paces till all was lost in darkness. Now of course all the
Lancasters were insulted, as their servant had been; but their
justification was not long delayed.

"On the Midsummer Eve of the fearful 1745, twenty-six persons, expressly
summoned by the family, saw all that had been seen before, and more.
Carriages were now interspersed with the troops; and everybody knew that
no carriages had been, or could be, on the summit of Souter Fell. The
multitude was beyond imagination; for the troops filled a space of a
mile, and marched quickly till night hid them—still marching. There was
nothing vaporous or indistinct about the appearance of the spectres. So
real did they seem, that some of the people went up the next morning, to
look for the hoof-marks of the horses; and awful it was to them to find
not one footprint on heather or grass. The witnesses attested the whole
story on oath before a magistrate; and fearful were the expectations
held by the whole country-side

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

about the coming events of the Scotch rebellion.

"It now comes out that two other persons had seen something of the sort
in the interval *viz*., in 1743—but had concealed it, to escape the
insults to which their neighbours were subjected. Mr. Wren, of Wilton
Hall, and his farm servant, saw, one summer evening, a man and a dog on
the mountain, pursuing some horses along a place so steep that a horse
could hardly by any possibility keep a footing on it. Their speed was
prodigious, and their disappearance at the south end of the fell so
rapid, that Mr. Wren and the servant went up, the next morning, to find
the body of the man who must have been killed. Of man, horse, or dog,
they found not a trace; and they came down and held their tongues. When
they did speak, they fared not much better for having twenty-six sworn
comrades in their disgrace.

"As for the explanation, the editor of the *Lonsdale Magazine* declared
(volume ii, page 313) that it was discovered that on the Midsummer Eve
of 1745 the rebels were 'exercising on the western cost of Scotland,
whose

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

movements had been reflected by some transparent vapour, similar to the
Fata Morgana'. This is not much in the way of explanation; but it is, as
far as we know, all that can be had at present. These facts, however,
brought out a good many more; as the spectral march of the same kind
seen in Leicestershire in 1707, and the tradition of the tramp of armies
over Helvellyn, on the eve of the battle of Marston Moor."

Other cases are cited in which flocks of spectral sheep have been seen
on certain roads, and there are of course various German stories of
phantom cavalcades of hunters and robbers.

Now in these cases, as so often happens in the investigation of occult
phenomena, there are several possible causes, any one of which would be
quite adequate to the production of the observed occurrences, but in the
absence of fuller information it is hardly feasible to do more than
guess as to which of these possible causes were in operation in any
particular instance.

The explanation usually suggested (whenever the whole story is not
ridiculed as a

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

falsehood) is that what is seen is a reflection by mirage of the
movements of a real body and troops, taking place at a considerable
distance. I have myself seen the ordinary mirage on several occasions
and know something therefore of its wonderful powers of deception; but
it seems to me that we should need some entirely new variety of mirage,
quite different form that at present known to science, to account for
these tales of phantom armies, some of which pass the spectator within a
few years.

First of all, they may be, as apparently in the Westphalian case above
mentioned, simply instances of prevision on a gigantic scale—by whom
arranged, and for what purpose, it is not easy to divine. Again, they
may often belong to the past instead of the future, and be in fact the
reflect in of scenes from the ākāshic records—though here again the
reason and method of such reflection is not obvious.

There are plenty of tribes of nature-spirits perfectly capable, if for
any reason they wished to do so, of producing such appearances by their
wonderful power of glamour (See *Theosophical Manual*, No. V, page 86),
and

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

such action would be quite in keeping with their delight in mystifying
and impressing human beings. Or it may even sometimes be kindly intended
by them as a warning to their friends of events that they know to be
about to take place. It seems as though some explanation along these
lines would be the most reasonable method of accounting for the
extraordinary series of phenomena described by Miss Martineau—that is,
if the stories told to her can be relied upon.

Another possibility is that in some cases what have been taken for
soldiers were simply the nature-spirits themselves going through some of
the ordered evolutions in which they take so much delight, though it
must be admitted that these are rarely of a character which could be
mistaken for military manœuvres except by the most ignorant.

The flocks of animals are probably inmost instances mere records, but
there are cases where they, like the "wild huntsmen" of German story,
belong to an entirely different class of phenomena which is altogether
outside of our present subject. Students of the occult will be familiar
with the fact that the

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

circumstances surrounding any scene of intense terror or passion, such
as an exceptionally horrible murder, are liable to be occasionally
reproduced in a form which it needs a very slight development of psychic
faculty to be able to see; and it has sometimes happened that various
animals formed part of such surroundings, and consequently they also are
periodically reproduced by the action of the guilty conscience of the
murderer. (See *Manual* V, page 115).

Probably whatever foundation of fact underlies the various stories of
spectral horsemen and hunting-troops may generally be referred to this
category. This is also the explanation, evidently, of some of the
visions of ghostly armies, such as that remarkable reenactment of the
battle of Edgehill which seems to have taken place at intervals for some
months after the date of the real struggle, as testified by a justice of
the peace, a clergyman, and other eyewitnesses in a curious contemporary
pamphlet entitled *Prodigious Noises of War and Battle, at Edgehill,
near Keinton, in Northamptonshire*. According to the pamphlet this case
was investigated at the time by some

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

officers of the army, who clearly recognized many of the phantom figures
that they saw. This looks decidedly like an instance of the terrible
power of man's unrestrained passions to reproduce themselves, and to
cause in some strange way a kind of materialization of their record.

In some cases it is clear that the flocks of animals seen have been
simply hordes of unclean artificial elementals taking that form in order
to feed upon the loathsome emanations of peculiarly horrible places,
such as would be the site of a gallows. An instance of this kind is
furnished by the celebrated "Gyb Ghosts", or ghosts of the biggest,
describe in *More Glimpses of the World Unseen*, page 109, as being
repeatedly seen in the form of herds of misshapen swine-like creatures,
rushing, rooting and fighting night after night on the site of that foul
monument of crime. But these belong to the subject of apparitions rather
than to that of clairvoyance.
