### CHAPTER V.

#### NATURAL PHENOMENA.

<span class="smallcaps">Many</span> of the most beautiful and graphic
passages in Shakespeare's writings have pictured the sun in highly
glowing language, and often invested it with that sweet pathos for which
the poet was so signally famous. Expressions, for instance, such as the
following are ever frequent:—"The glorious sun" ("Twelfth Night," iv.
3); "heaven's glorious sun" ("Love's Labour's Lost," i. 1); "gorgeous as
the sun at Midsummer" ("1 Henry IV.," iv. 1); "all the world is cheered
by the sun" ("Richard III.," i. 2); "the sacred radiance of the sun"
("King Lear," i. 1); "sweet tidings of the sun's uprise" ("Titus
Andronicus," iii. 1), &c. Then, again, how often we come across passages
replete with pathos, such as "the sun sets weeping in the lowly west"
("Richard II.," ii. 4); "ere the weary sun set in the west" ("Comedy of
Errors," i. 2); "the weary sun hath made a golden set" ("Richard III.,"
v. 3); "the sun for sorrow will not show his head" ("Romeo and Juliet,"
v. 3), &c. Although, however, Shakespeare has made such constant mention
of the sun, yet his allusions to the folk-lore connected with it are
somewhat scanty.

According to the old philosophy, the sun was accounted a planet, <span
id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88.md) and thought to be whirled round the earth
by the motion of a solid sphere, in which it was fixed. In "Antony and
Cleopatra" (iv. 15), Cleopatra exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                   "O sun,  
Burn the great sphere thou movest in! darkling stand  
The varying shore o’ the world."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Supposing this
sphere consumed, the sun must wander in endless space, and, as a natural
consequence, the earth be involved in endless night.

   In "1 Henry IV.," (i. 2), Falstaff, according to vulgar astronomy,
calls the sun a "wandering knight,"—and by this expression evidently
alludes to some knight of romance. Mr Douce <span
id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89.md) considered the allusion was to "The Voyage
of the Wandering Knight," by Jean de Cathenay, of which the translation,
by W. Goodyeare, appeared about the year 1600. The words may be a
portion of some forgotten ballad.

   A pretty fancy is referred to in "Romeo and Juliet" (iii. 5), where
Capulet says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;  
 But for the sunset of my brother's son  
 It rains downright."</span>

</div>

And so, too, in the "Rape of Lucreece":—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But as the earth doth weep, the sun being
set."</span>

</div>

   "That Shakespeare thought it was the air," says Singer, <span
id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_90.md) "and not the earth, that drizzled dew, is
evident from many passages in his works. Thus, in King John" (ii. 1) he
says:—"Before the dew of evening fall." Steevens, alluding to the
following passage in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (iii. 1), "and when she
(*i.e.* the moon) weeps, weeps every little flower," says that
Shakespeare "means that every little flower is moistened with dew, as if
with tears; and not that the flower itself drizzles dew."

   By a popular fancy, the sun was formerly said to dance at its rising
on Easter morning—to which there may be an allusion in "Romeo and
Juliet" (iii. 5), where Romeo addressing Juliet, says

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Look, love, what envious streaks  
 Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east;  
 Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day  
 Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We may also
compare the expression in "Coriolanus" (v. 4):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,  
 Tabors and cymbals and the shouting Romans,  
 Make the sun dance."</span>

</div>

   Mr Knight remarks, there was "Something exquisitely beautiful in the
old custom of going forth into the fields before the sun had risen on
Easter Day, to see him mounting over the hills with tremulous motion, as
if it were an animate thing, bounding in sympathy with the redeemed of
mankind." <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91.md)

   A cloudy rising of the sun has generally been regarded as ominous—a
superstition equally prevalent on the Continent as in this country. In
"Richard III." (v. 3), King Richard asks:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Who saw the sun to-day?  
    *Ratcliff*. Not I, my lord,  
    *K. Richard*. Then he disdains to shine; for, by the book  
 He should have braved the east an hour ago:  
 A black day will it be to somebody."</span>

</div>

   "The learned Moresin in his 'Papatus,'" says Brand, <span
id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_92.md) "reckons among omens, the cloudy rising of
the sun." Virgil, too, in his 1st Georgic (441–9) considers it a sign of
stormy weather <span id="fr_93"></span>[3](#fn_93.md):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Ille ubi nascentem maculis variaverit ortum  
 Conditus in nubem, medioque refugerit orbe;  
 Suspecti tibi sint imbres; namque urget ab alto  
 Arboribusque satisque notus pecorique sinister,  
 Aut ubi sub lucem densa inter nubila sese  
 Diversi rumpent radii, ut ubi pallida surget,  
 Tithoni croceum linquens Aurora cubile:  
 Heu male tum mites defendet pampinus uvas:  
 Tam multa in tectis crepitans salit horrida grando."</span>

</div>

   A red sunrise is also unpropitious, and according to a well-known
rhyme:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If red the sun begins his race,  
 Be sure the rain will fall apace."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

   This old piece of weather-wisdom is mentioned by our Lord in St
Matthew xvi. 2, 3:—"When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather:
for the sky is red. And in the morning, It will be foul weather today,
for the sky is red and lowring." Shakespeare in his "Venus and Adonis,"
thus describes it:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"—A red morn, that ever yet betoken’d  
 Wreck to the seaman, tempest to the field,  
 Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,  
 Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds."</span>

</div>

   Mr Swainson <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94.md) shows that this
notion is common on the Continent. Thus, at Milan the proverb runs, "If
the morn be red, rain is at hand."

   Shakespeare in "Richard II." (ii. 4), alludes to another indication
of rain:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The sun sets weeping in the lowly west,  
 Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest."</span>

</div>

   A "watery sunset" is still considered by many a forerunner of wet. A
red sunset, on the other hand, beautifully described in "Richard III"
(v. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The weary sun hath made a golden set,"</span>

</div>

is universally regarded as a prognostication of fine weather, and we
find countless proverbs illustrative of this notion—one of the most
popular being—"Sky red at night, is the sailor's delight."

   From the earliest times an eclipse of the sun was looked upon as an
omen of coming calamity; and was oftentimes the source of extraordinary
alarm as well as the occasion of various superstitious ceremonies. In
1597, during an eclipse of the sun, it is stated that at Edinburgh, men
and women thought the day of judgment was come. <span
id="fr_95"></span>[2](#fn_95.md) Many women swooned, much crying was heard
in the streets, and in fear some ran to the kirk to pray. Mr Napier says
he remembers "an eclipse about 1818, when about three parts of the sun
was covered. The alarm in the village was very great, indoor work was
suspended for the time, and in several families

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

prayers were offered for protection, believing that it portended some
awful calamity; but when it passed off there was a general feeling of
relief." In "King Lear" (i. 2), Gloucester remarks:—"These late eclipses
in the sun and moon portend no good to us: though the wisdom of nature
can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourged by the
sequent effects; love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide; in
cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the
bond cracked ’twixt son and father." Othello, too (v. 2), in his agony
and despair, exclaims:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                            "O heavy hour!  
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse  
Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe  
Should yawn at alteration."</span>

</div>

   Francis Bernier <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96.md) says that, in
France in 1654, at an eclipse of the sun, "some bought drugs against the
eclipse, others kept themselves close in the dark in their caves and
their well closed chambers, others cast themselves in great multitudes
into the churches; those apprehending some malign and dangerous
influence, and these believing that they were come to the last day, and
that the eclipse would shake the foundations of nature." <span
id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_97.md)

   In "3rd Henry VI." (ii. 1), Shakespeare refers to a curious
circumstance in which, on a certain occasion, the sun is reported to
have appeared like three suns. Edward says, "do I see three suns?" to
which Richard replies:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;  
 Not separated with the racking clouds,  
 But sever’d in a pale clear-shining sky.  
 See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,  
 As if they vow’d some league inviolable:  
 Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun,  
 In this the heaven figures some event." <span
id="fr_98"></span>[3](#fn_98.md)</span>

</div>

   This fact is mentioned both by Hall and Holinshed, the latter
says:—"At which tyme the sun (as some write)

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

appeared to the Earl of March like *three sunnes*, and sodainely joyned
altogether in one, upon whiche sight hee tooke such courage, that he
fiercely setting on his enemyes put them to flight."—We may note here
that on Trinity Sunday three suns are supposed to be seen. In the
"Memoires de l’Academie Celtique" (iii. 447), it is stated that "Le jour
de la fête de la Trinite, quelques personne vont de grand matin dans la
campagne, pour y voir levre trois soleils à la fois."

   According to an old proverb to quit a better for a worse situation
was spoken of as to go "out of God's blessing into the warm sun," a
reference to which we find in "King Lear" (ii. 2), where Kent says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Good King, that must approve the common saw,  
 That out of heaven's benediction comest  
 To the warm sun."</span>

</div>

   Dr Johnson thinks that Hamlet alludes to this saying (i. 2), for when
the king says to him, "How is it that the clouds still hang on you?" he
replies, "not so, my lord; I am too much i’ the sun," *i.e.*, out of
God's blessing.

   This expression, says Mr Dyce, <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_99.md) is
found in various authors from Heywood down to Swift—the former has:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"In your running from him to me, yee runne  
 Out of God's blessing into the warme sunne."</span>

</div>

And the latter—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Lord Sparkish*. They say, marriages are made in
heaven; but I doubt, when she was married, she had no friend there.  
 *Neverout*. Well, she's got out of God's blessing into the warm
sun." <span id="fr_100"></span>[2](#fn_100.md)</span>

</div>

   There seems to have been a prejudice from time immemorial against
sunshine in March; and according to a German saying, it were "better to
be bitten by a snake than to feel the sun in March." Thus in "1 Henry
IV." (iv. 1), Hotspur says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "Worse than the sun in March,  
This praise doth nourish agues."</span>

</div>

   Shakespeare employs the words "sun-burned" in the sense of uncomely,
ill-favoured. In "Much ado" (ii. 1), Beatrice

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

says, "I am sunburnt;" and in "Troilus and Cressida" (i. 3), Æneas
remarks—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth  
 The splinter of a lance."</span>

</div>

   *Moon*. Apart from his sundry allusions to the "pale-faced," "silver
moon," Shakespeare has referred to many of the superstitions associated
with it, several of which still linger on in country nooks. A widespread
legend of great antiquity informs us that the moon is inhabited by a
man <span id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_101.md) with a bundle of sticks on his
back, who has been exiled thither for many centuries, and who is so far
off that he is beyond the reach of death. This tradition, which has
given rise to many superstitions, is still preserved under various forms
in most countries; but it has not been decided who the culprit
originally was, and how he came to be imprisoned in his lonely abode.
Dante calls him Cain; Chaucer assigns his exile as a punishment for
theft, and gives him a thorn-bush to carry, while Shakespeare also loads
him with the thorns, but by way of compensation gives him a dog for a
companion. In the "Tempest" (ii. 2), Caliban asks Stephano whether he
has "not dropp’d from heaven?" to which he answers, "Out o’ the moon, I
do assure thee: I was the man i’ the moon when time was." Whereupon
Caliban says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:  
 My mistress show’d me thee and thy dog and thy bush."</span>

</div>

We may also compare the expression in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (v.
1), where, in the directions for the performance of the play of "Pyramus
and Thisbe," Moonshine is represented "with lanthorn, dog, and bush of
thorn." And further on in the same scene, describing himself, Moonshine
says—"All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the lanthorn is the
moon; I, the man in the moon; <span id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_102.md) this
thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog."

   Ordinarily, <span id="fr_103"></span>[3](#fn_103.md) however, his
offence is stated to have been

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Sabbath-breaking—an idea derived from the Old Testament. Like the man
mentioned in the "Book of Numbers" (xv. 32), he is caught gathering
sticks on the Sabbath; and, as an example to mankind, he is condemned to
stand for ever in the moon, with his bundle on his back. Instead of a
dog, one German version places him with a woman, whose crime was
churning butter on Sunday. The Jews have a legend that Jacob is the
moon, and they believe that his face is visible. Mr Baring Gould <span
id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_104.md) says that the "idea of locating animals
in the two great luminaries of heaven is very ancient, and is a relic of
a primeval superstition of the Aryan race." The natives of Ceylon,
instead of a man, have placed a hare in the moon; and the Chinese
represent the moon by "a rabbit pounding rice in a mortar." <span
id="fr_105"></span>[2](#fn_105.md)

   From the very earliest times the moon has not only been an object of
popular superstition, but been honoured by various acts of adoration. In
Europe, <span id="fr_106"></span>[3](#fn_106.md) in the fifteenth century,
"it was a matter of complaint that some still worshipped the new moon
with bended knee, or hood or hat removed. And to this day we may still
see a hat raised to her, half in conservatism and half in jest. It is
with deference to silver as the lunar metal that money is turned when
the act of adoration is performed, while practical peasant wit dwells on
the ill luck of having no piece of silver when the new moon is first
seen." Shakespeare often incidentally alludes to this form of
superstition. To quote one or two out of many instances, Enobarbus, in
"Antony and Cleopatra" (iv. 9) says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon."</span>

</div>

In "Love's Labour's Lost" (v. 2), the king says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to
shine,  
 Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne."</span>

</div>

Indeed it was formerly a common practice for people to address
invocations to the moon, <span id="fr_107"></span>[4](#fn_107.md) and even
at the present day we find remnants of this practice both in this
country and

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

abroad. Thus in many places it is customary for young women to appeal to
the moon to tell them of their future prospects in matrimony, <span
id="fr_108"></span>[1](#fn_108.md) the following or similar lines being
repeated on the occasion—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"New moon, new moon, I hail thee:  
 New moon, new moon, be kind to me;  
 If I marry man or man marry me,  
 Show me how many moons it will be."</span>

</div>

It was also the practice to swear by the moon, to which we find an
allusion in "Romeo and Juliet" (ii. 2), where Juliet reproves her lover
for testifying his affections by this means—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,  
 That monthly changes in her circled orb,  
 Lest that thy love prove likewise variable."</span>

</div>

And again, in "Merchant of Venice" (v. 1), where Gratiano exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong."</span>

</div>

   We may note here that the inconstancy <span
id="fr_109"></span>[2](#fn_109.md) of the moon is the subject of various
myths, of which Mr Tylor has given the following examples:—Thus an
Australian legend says that Mityan, the moon, was a native cat, who fell
in love with some one else's wife, and was driven away to wander ever
since. A Slavonic legend tells us that the moon, king of night, and
husband of the sun, faithlessly loved the morning star, wherefore he was
cloven through in punishment, as we see him in the sky. The Khasias of
the Himalaya say that the moon falls monthly in love with his
mother-in-law, who throws ashes in his face, whence his spots. <span
id="fr_110"></span>[3](#fn_110.md)

   As in the case of the sun, an eclipse of the moon was formerly
considered ominous. The Romans <span id="fr_111"></span>[4](#fn_111.md)
supposed it was owing to the influence of magical charms, to counteract
which they had recourse to the sound of brazen instruments of all

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

kinds. Juvenal alludes to this practice in his Sixth Satire (44i), when
he describes his talkative woman—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">        "Jam nemo tubas, nemo æra fatiget,  
Una laboranti poterit succurrere lunæ."</span>

</div>

   Indeed eclipses, which to us are well-known phenomena witnessing to
the exactness of natural laws, were in the earlier stages of
civilisation regarded as "the very embodiment of miraculous disaster."
Thus the Chinese believed that during eclipses of the sun and moon these
celestial bodies were attacked by a great serpent, to drive away which
they struck their gongs or brazen drums. The Peruvians entertaining a
similar notion, raised a frightful din when the moon was eclipsed, <span
id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112.md) while some savages would shoot up arrows
to defend their luminaries against the enemies they fancied were
attacking them. It was also a popular belief that the moon was affected
by the influence of witchcraft, a notion referred to by Prospero in "The
Tempest" (v. 1), who says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"His mother was a witch, and one so strong  
 That could control the moon."</span>

</div>

   In a former scene (ii. 1), Gonzalo remarks:—"You are gentlemen of
brave metal; you would lift the moon out of her sphere." Douce <span
id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_113.md) quotes a marginal reference from
Adlington's translation of "Apuleius" (1596), a book well known to
Shakespeare:—"Witches in old time were supposed to be of such power,
that they could put downe the moone by their enchantment." <span
id="fr_114"></span>[3](#fn_114.md) One of the earliest references to this
superstition among classical authorities is, that in the "Clouds" of
Aristophanes, where Strepsiades proposes the hiring of a Thessalian
witch, to bring down the moon and shut her up in a box, that he might
thus evade paying his debts by a month. Ovid, in his "Metamorphoses" (c.
xii. 263), says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Mater erat Mycale; quam deduxisse canendo  
 Sæpe reluctanti constabat cornua lunæ."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Horace in his
fifth Epode (l. 45) tells us:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Quæ sidera excantata voce Thessala,  
 Lunamque cœlo deripit." <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115.md)</span>

</div>

   Reverting again to the moon's eclipse; such a season being considered
most unlucky for lawful enterprises, was held suitable for evil designs.
Thus, in "Macbeth" (iv. 1), one of the witches, speaking of the
ingredients of the cauldron, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Gall of goat, and slips of yew,  
 Sliver’d in the moon's eclipse."</span>

</div>

   As a harbinger of misfortune it is referred to in "Antony, and
Cleopatra" where (iii. 13), Antony says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">               "Alack, our terrene moon  
Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone  
The fall of Antony!"</span>

</div>

Milton in his "Paradise Lost" (bk. i. S97), speaks much in the same
strain:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As when the sun new-risen  
 Looks through the horizontal misty air  
 Shorn of his beams, or from behind the moon  
 In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds  
 On half the nations."</span>

</div>

And in "Lycidas," he says of the unlucky ship that was wrecked:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"It was that fatal and perfidious bark  
 Built in the eclipse."</span>

</div>

   Its sanguine colour is also mentioned as an indication of coming
disasters in "Richard II." (ii. 4), where the Welsh captain remarks how

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the
earth."</span>

</div>

And its paleness, too, in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (ii. 2), is spoken
of as an unpropitious sign.

   According to a long accepted theory, insane persons are said to be
influenced by the moon; and many old writers

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

have supported this notion. Indeed, Shakespeare himself in "Othello" (v.
2), tells how the moon when "She comes more nearer earth than she was
wont, makes men mad." Dr Forbes Winslow, in his "Light: its Influence on
Life and Health," says, that "it is impossible altogether to ignore the
evidence of such men as Pinel, Daquin, Guislain, and others, yet the
experience of modern psychological physicians, is to a great degree
opposed to the deductions of these eminent men." He suggests that the
alleged changes observed among the insane at certain phases of the moon,
may arise, not from the direct, but the indirect, influence of the
planet. It is well known that certain important meteorological
phenomena, result from the various phases of the moon, such as the
rarity of the air, the electric conditions of the atmosphere, the degree
of heat, dryness, moisture, and amount of wind prevailing. It is urged
then, that those suffering from diseases of the brain, and nervous
system affecting the mind, cannot be considered as exempt from the
operation of agencies that are admitted to affect patients afflicted
with other maladies. Dr Winslow further adds, that "an intelligent lady,
who occupied for about five years the position of matron in my
establishment for insane ladies, has remarked that she invariably
observed among them, a greater agitation when the moon was at its full."
A correspondent of "Notes and Queries" (2nd S., xii. 492), explains the
apparent aggravated symptoms of madness at the full moon by the fact
that the insane are naturally more restless on light than on dark
nights, and that in consequence loss of sleep makes them more excitable.
We may note here, that in "Antony and Cleopatra" (iv. 9), Enobarbus
invokes the moon as the "sovereign mistress of true melancholy."

The moisture of the moon is invariably noticed by Shakespeare. In
"Hamlet" (i. 1) Horatio tells how "the moist star upon whose influence
Neptune's empire stands, was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse." In
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" (ii. 1) Titania says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,  
 Pale in her anger, washes all the air,  
 That rheumatic diseases do abound."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And in "The
Winter's Tale" (i. 2) Polixenes commences by saying how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nine changes of the watery star hath been  
 The shepherd's note since we have left our throne  
 Without a burthen."</span>

</div>

We may compare, too, the words of Enobarbus in "Antony and Cleopatra"
(iv. 9), who, after addressing the moon, says—"The poisonous damp of
night disponge upon me." And once more in "Romeo and Juliet" (i. 4) we
read of the "moonshine's watery beams."

   The same idea is frequently found in old writers. Thus for instance,
in Newton's "Direction for the Health of Magistrates and Studentes,"
(1574), we are told that "the moone is ladye of moisture." Bartholomœus
in "De Proprietate Rerum" describes the moon as "mother of all humours,
minister and ladye of the sea." <span id="fr_116"></span>[1](#fn_116.md) In
Lydgate's prologue to his "Story of Thebes" there are two lines not
unlike those in "Midsummer Night's Dream" already quoted—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Of Lucina the moone, moist and pale,  
 That many shoure fro heaven made availe."</span>

</div>

Of course, the moon is thus spoken of as governing the tides, and from
its supposed influence on the weather. <span
id="fr_117"></span>[2](#fn_117) In 1 Henry IV. (i. 2.md) Falstaff alludes
to the sea being governed "by our noble and chaste mistress the moon";
and in "Richard III." (ii. 2) Queen Elizabeth says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"That I, being govern’d by the watery moon,  
 May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world."</span>

</div>

We may compare, too, what Timon says, "Timon of Athens" (iv. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves The
moon into salt tears."</span>

</div>

The expression of Hecate in "Macbeth" (iii. 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Upon the corner of the moon  
 There hangs a vaporous drop profound,"</span>

</div>

seems to have been meant for the same as the *virus lunare* of the
ancients, being a foam which the moon was supposed

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

to shed on particular herbs, when strongly solicited by enchantment.
Lucan introduces Erictho using it (Pharsalia, book vi. 669)—"Et virus
large lunare ministrat."

   By a popular astrological doctrine the moon was supposed to exercise
great influence over agricultural operations, and also over many "of the
minor concerns of life, such as the gathering of herbs, the killing of
animals for the table, and other matters of a like nature." Thus the
following passage in the "Merchant of Venice" (v. 1), it has been
suggested, has reference to the practices of the old herbalists who
attributed particular virtues to plants gathered during particular
phases of the moon and hours of the night. After Lorenzo has spoken of
the moon shining brightly, Jessica adds—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     —"In such a night  
Medea gather’d the enchanted herbs,  
That did renew old Æson."</span>

</div>

And in "Hamlet" (iv. 7) the description which Laertes gives of the
weapon-poison refers to the same notion—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I bought an unction of a mountebank,  
 So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,  
 Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,  
 Collected from all simples that have virtue  
 Under the moon, can save the thing from death."</span>

</div>

The sympathy of growing and declining nature with the waxing and waning
moon is a superstition widely spread, and is as firmly believed in by
many as when Tusser in his "Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry,"
under "February" gave the following advice—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sow peason and beans, in the wane of the moon,  
 Who soweth them sooner, he soweth too soon,  
 That they with the planet may rest and arise,  
 And flourish, with bearing most plentifull wise."</span>

</div>

Warburton considers that this notion is alluded to by Shakespeare in
"Troilus and Cressida" (iii. 2) where Troilus speaking of the sincerity
of his love tells Cressida it is—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,  
 As sun to day, as turtle to her mate."</span>

</div>

There is a little doubt as to the exact meaning of plantage in this
passage. Nares observes that it probably

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

means anything that is planted; but Mr Ellacombe in his "Plant Lore of
Shakespeare" (1878, p. 165) says "it is doubtless the same as plantain."

   It appears that, in days gone by, "neither sowing, planting, nor
grafting was ever undertaken without a scrupulous attention to the
increase or waning of the moon." <span id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_118.md)
Scot, in his "Discoverie of Witchcraft," notes how "the poore husbandman
perceiveth that the increase of the moone maketh plants fruitful, so as
in the full moone they are in best strength; decaieing in the wane, and
in the conjunction do utterlie wither and vade."

   It was a prevailing notion that the moon had an attending star—Lilly
calls it "Lunisequa;" and Sir Richard Hawkins, in his "Observations in a
voyage to the South Seas in 1593," published in 1622, remarks: "Some I
have heard say, and others write, that there is a starre which never
separateth itself from the moon, but a small distance." Staunton
considers that there is an allusion to this idea in "Love's Labour's
Lost" (iv. 3), where the king says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon:  
 She an attending star, scarce seen a light."</span>

</div>

   The sharp ends of the new moon are popularly termed horns—a term
which occurs in "Coriolanus" (i. 1)—"They threw their caps as they would
hang them on the horns o’ the moon." It is made use of in Decker's
"Match me in London" (i.)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My lord, doe you see this change i’ the moone?  
 Sharp homes doe threaten windy weather."</span>

</div>

When the horns of the moon appear to point upwards, the moon is said to
be like a boat, and various weather prognostications are drawn from this
phenomena. <span id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_119.md) According to sailors,
it is an omen of fine weather, whereas others affirm it is a sign of
rain—resembling a basin full of water about to fall.

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

   Among other items of folk-lore connected with the moon, we may
mention the moon-calf, a false conception, or fœtus imperfectly formed,
in consequence, as was supposed, of the influence of the moon. The best
account of this fabulous substance may be found in Drayton's poem with
that title. Trinculo in the "Tempest" (ii. 2), supposes Caliban to be a
moon-calf—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I hid me under the dead moon-calf's
gaberdine."</span>

</div>

It has been suggested that in calling Caliban a moon-calf, Shakespeare
alluded to a superstitious belief formerly current, in the intercourse
of demons and other non-human beings with mankind. In the days of
witchcraft, it was supposed that a class of devils called Incubi and
Succubi roamed the earth with the express purpose of tempting people to
abandon their purity of life. Hence, all badly deformed children were
suspected of having had such an undesirable parentage. <span
id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120.md)

   A curious expression, "a sop o’ the moonshine," occurs in "King Lear"
(ii. 2), which probably alludes to some dish so called. Kent says to the
steward—"Draw, you rogue; for, though it be night, yet the moon shines;
I'll make a sop o’ the moonshine of you."

   There was a way of dressing eggs, called "eggs in moonshine," of
which Douce <span id="fr_121"></span>[2](#fn_121.md) gives the following
description:—"Eggs were broken and boiled in salad oil till the yolks
became hard. They were eaten with slices of onion fried in oil, butter,
verjuice, nutmeg, and salt." "A sop in the moonshine" must have been a
sippet in this dish. <span id="fr_122"></span>[3](#fn_122.md)

   *Planets*.—The irregular motion of the planets was supposed to
portend some disaster to mankind. Ulysses in "Troilus and Cressida" (i.
3), declares how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "When the planets  
In evil mixture to disorder wander,  
What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!  
What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!</span>

</div>

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span>  Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,  
 Divert and crack, rend and deracinate  
 The unity and married calm of states  
 Quite from their fixture."</span>

</div>

Indeed, the planets themselves were not thought in days gone by, to be
confined in any fixed orbit of their own, but ceaselessly to wander
about, as the etymology of their name demonstrates. A popular name for
the planets was "wandering stars," of which Cotgrave says, "they bee
also called wandering starres, because they never keep one certain place
or station in the firmament." Thus Hamlet (v. 1), approaching the grave
of Ophelia, addresses Laertes—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "What is he whose grief  
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow  
Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand  
Like wonder-wounded hearers?"</span>

</div>

In Tomkis's "Albumazar" (i. 1), they are called "wanderers"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Your patron Mercury, in his mysterious character  
 Holds all the marks of the other wanderers."</span>

</div>

According to vulgar astrology, the planets like the stars, were supposed
to affect, more or less, the affairs of this world, a notion frequently
referred to by old writers. In "Winter's Tale" (ii. 1), Hermione
consoles herself in the thought—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">       "There's some ill planet reigns:  
I must be patient till the heavens look  
With an aspect more favourable."</span>

</div>

In 1 Henry VI. (i. 1), the Duke of Exeter asks—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What! shall we curse the planets of mishap  
 That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?"</span>

</div>

Again, King Richard (Richard III., iv. 4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Be opposite all planets of good luck  
 To my proceedings."</span>

</div>

And once more, in "Hamlet" (i. 1), Marcellus, speaking of the season of
our Saviour's birth, says, "then no planets strike."

   That diseases, too, are dependent upon planetary influence is
referred to in "Timon of Athens" (iv. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Be as a planetary plague, when Jove  
 Will o’er some high-viced city hang his poison  
 In the sick air: Let not thy sword skip one."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

   "Fiery Trigon" was a term in the old judicial astrology, when the
three upper planets met in a fiery sign,—a phenomenon which was supposed
to indicate rage and contention. It is mentioned in "2 Henry IV." (ii.
4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">   "*P. Hen.* Saturn and Venus this year in
conjunction! What says the almanac to that?  
   *Poins*. And, look, whether the fiery Trigon, his man, be not lisping
to his master's old tables!"</span>

</div>

   Dr Nash, in his notes to Butler's "Hudibras," says, "the twelve signs
in astrology are divided into four *trigons* or triplicities, each
denominated from the connatural element; so they are three fiery
\[signs\], three airy, three watery, and three earthy:"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Fiery—Aries, Leo, Sagittarius.

Airy—Gemini, Libra, Aquarius.

Watery—Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces.

Earthly—Taurus, Virgo, Capricornus.

</div>

   Thus, when the three superior planets met in Aries, Leo, or
Sagittarius, they formed a *fiery trigon;* when in Cancer, Scorpio, and
Pisces, a watery one.

   *Charles’s Wain* was the old name for the seven bright stars of the
constellation Ursa Major. The constellation was so named in honour of
Charlemagne; or, according to some, it is a corruption of chorles or
churl's, *i.e.*, rustic's wain. Chorl is frequently used for a
countryman in old books, from the Saxon ceorl. In "1 Henry IV." (ii. 1),
the Carrier says, "Charles’ wain is over the new chimney."

   *Music of the spheres*.—Pythagoras was the first who suggested this
notion, so beautifully expressed by Shakespeare in the "Merchant of
Venice" (v. 1).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"There's not the smallest orb which thou
behold’st,  
 But in his motion like an angel sings,  
 Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins."</span>

</div>

   Plato says that a syren sits on each planet, who carols a most sweet
song, agreeing to the motion of her own particular planet, but
harmonising with the other seven. Hence Milton in his "Arcades" speaks
of the "celestial syrens’ harmony, that sits upon the nine enfolded
spheres."

   *Stars*.—An astrological doctrine, which has kept its place

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

in modern popular philosophy, asserts that mundane events are more or
less influenced by the stars. That astronomers should have divided the
sun's course into imaginary signs of the Zodiac, was enough, says Mr
Tylor, <span id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md) to originate astrological
rules "that these celestial signs have an actual effect on real earthly
rams, bulls, crabs, lions, virgins." Hence we are told that a child born
under the sign of the Lion will be courageous; but one born under the
Crab will not go forth well in life; one born under the Waterman is
likely to be drowned, and so forth. Shakespeare frequently alludes to
this piece of superstition, which, it must be remembered, was carried to
a ridiculous height in his day. In "Julius Cæsar" (i. 2), Cassius says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,  
 But in ourselves, that we are underlings."</span>

</div>

   In the following passage in "Twelfth Night" (i. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">   "*Sir Tob.* Were we not born under Taurus?  
   *Sir And.* Taurus! that's sides and heart.  
   *Sir Tob.* No, sir; it is legs and thighs."</span>

</div>

"Both the knights," says Mr Douce ("Illustrations of Shakspeare," p.
54), "are wrong in their astrology, according to the Almanacs of the
time, which make Taurus govern the neck and throat."

   Beatrice, in "Much Ado about Nothing" (ii. 1), says:" There was a
star danced, and under that was I born;" Kent, in "King Lear" (iv. 3),
remarks, "it is the stars, the stars above us, govern our conditions;"
and once more, in "Pericles" (i. 1), King Antilochus, speaking of the
charming qualities of his daughter, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,  
 For the embracements even of Jove himself:  
 At whose conception, till Lucina reign’d,  
 Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,  
 The senate-house of planets all did sit,  
 To knit in her their best perfections." <span
id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124.md)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

   Throughout the East, says Mr Tylor, <span
id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_125.md) astrology even now remains a science in
full esteem. The condition of mediæval Europe may still be perfectly
realised by the traveller in Persia, where the Shah waits for days
outside the walls of his capital till the constellations allow him to
enter; and where, on the days appointed by the stars for letting blood,
it literally flows in streams from the barbers’ shops in the streets.
Professor Wuttke declares that there are many districts in Germany where
the child's horoscope is still regularly kept with the baptismal
certificate in the family chest." Astrology is ridiculed in a masterly
manner in "King Lear" (i. 2); and Warburton suggests that if the date of
the first performance of "King Lear" were well considered, "it would be
found that something or other had happened at that time which gave a
more than ordinary run to this deceit, as these words seem to
indicate—"I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day,
what should follow these eclipses." Zouch, <span
id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_126.md) speaking of Queen Mary's reign, tells us
that "Judicial astrology was much in use long after this time. Its
predictions were received with reverential awe; and even men of the most
enlightened understandings were inclined to believe that the
conjunctions and oppositions of the planets had no little influence in
the affairs of the world."

   The pretence, also, of predicting events—such as pestilence from the
aspect of the heavenly bodies—one form of medical astrology—is noticed
in "Venus and Adonis"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Long may they kiss each other, for this cure!  
 O, never let their crimson liveries wear!  
 And as they last, their verdure still endure,  
 To drive infection from the dangerous year!  
     That the star-gazers, having writ on death,  
     May say, the plague is banished by thy breath!"</span>

</div>

   Heroes were in ancient times immortalised by being placed among the
stars, a custom to which Bedford refers in "1 Henry VI." (i. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A far more glorious star thy soul will make  
 Than Julius Cæsar."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And, again,
"Pericles" (v. 3) exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Heavens make a star of him."</span>

</div>

   On a medal of Hadrian, the adopted son of Trajan and Plotina, the
divinity of his parents is expressed by placing a star over their heads;
and in like manner the medals of Faustina the Elder exhibit her on an
eagle, her head surrounded with stars. <span
id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_127.md)

   In "2 Henry IV." (iv. 3) a ludicrous term for the stars is, "cinders
of the elements;" and in "Merchant of Venice" (v. 1) they are designated
"candles of the night."

   *Meteors*.—An elegant description of a meteor well-known to sailors
is given by Ariel in "The Tempest" (i. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "Sometime I’d divide  
And burn in many places; on the topmast,  
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,  
Then meet and join."</span>

</div>

   It is called by the French and Spaniards inhabiting the coasts of the
Mediterranean—St Helme's or St Telme's fire; by the Italians—the fire of
St Peter and St Nicholas. It is also known as the fire of St Helen, St
Herm, and St Clare. Douce <span id="fr_128"></span>[2](#fn_128.md) tells us
that whenever it appeared as a single flame it was supposed by the
ancients to be Helena, the sister of Castor and Pollux, and in this
state to bring ill luck, from the calamities which this lady is known to
have caused in the Trojan war. When it came as a double flame it was
called Castor and Pollux, and accounted a good omen. It has been
described as a little blaze of fire, sometimes appearing by night on the
tops of soldiers’ lances, or at sea on masts and sailyards, whirling and
leaping in a moment from one place to another. According to some, it
never appears but after a tempest, and is supposed to lead people to
suicide by drowning. Shakespeare in all probability consulted Batman's
"Golden Books of the Leaden Goddes," who, speaking of Castor and Pollux,
says—"They were figured like two lampes or cresset lightes—one on the
toppe of a maste, the other on the stemme or foreshippe." He adds that
if the first light appears in the stem or foreship and ascends upwards,
it is a

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

sign of good luck; if "either lights begin at the topmast, bowsprit," or
foreship, and descend towards the sea, it is a sign of a tempest. In
taking, therefore, the latter position, Ariel had fulfilled the commands
of Prospero and raised a storm. <span id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_129.md) Mr
Swainson, in his "Weather Lore" (1873, p. 193), quotes the following,
which is to the same purport—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Last night I saw Saint Elmo's stars,  
 With their glittering lanterns all at play,  
 On the tops of the masts and the tips of the spars,  
 And I knew we should have foul weather that day."</span>

</div>

   Capell, in his "School of Shakespeare" (1779, iii. 7), has pointed
out a passage in Hakluyt's "Voyages" (1598, iii. 450), which strikingly
illustrates the speech of Ariel, quoted above:—"I do remember that in
the great and boysterous storme of this foule weather, in the night,
there came vpon the toppe of our maine yarde and maine maste, a certaine
little light, much like unto the light of a little candle, which the
Spaniards called the Cuerpo-Santo, and said it was St Elmo, whom they
take to bee the aduocate of sailers. . . . . This light continued aboord
our ship about three houres, flying from maste to maste, and from top to
top; and sometimes it would be in two or three places at once." This
meteor was by some supposed to be a spirit; and by others "an exhalation
of moyst vapours, that are ingendered by foul and tempestuous
weather." <span id="fr_130"></span>[2](#fn_130.md) Mr Thoms in his
"Notelets on Shakespeare" (1865, 59), says that, no doubt, Shakespeare
had in mind the will-o’-the wisp. <span id="fr_131"></span>[3](#fn_131.md)

   *Fire-Drake*,—which is jocularly used in "Henry VIII." (v. 4), for a
man with a red face, was one of the popular terms for the will-o’ the
wisp, <span id="fr_132"></span>[4](#fn_132.md) and Burton in his "Anatomy
of Melancholy" says:—"fiery spirits or devils are such as commonly work
by fire-drakes, or ignes fatui, which lead men often in flumina et
praecipitia." In Bullokar's "English Expositor" (1616), we

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

have a quaint account of this phenomenon, "Fire-drake; a fire sometimes
seen flying in the night like a dragon. Common people think it a spirit
that keepeth some treasure hid, but philosophers affirme it to be a
great unequal exhalation inflamed betweene two clouds, the one hot, the
other cold, which is the reason that it also smoketh, the middle part
whereof, according to the proportion of the hot cloud being greater than
the rest, maketh it seem like a bellie, and both ends like unto a head
and tail." <span id="fr_133"></span>[1](#fn_133.md) White, however, in his
"Peripateticall Institutions" (p. 156), calls the fiery-dragon or
fire-drake, "a weaker kind of lightning. Its livid colours, and its
falling without noise and slowly, demonstrate a great mixture of watery
exhalation in it. . . . . . ’Tis sufficient for its shape, that it has
some resemblance of a dragon not the expresse figure."

   Among other allusions to the will-o’ the wisp by Shakespeare, Mr
Hunter <span id="fr_134"></span>[2](#fn_134.md) notices one in "King Lear"
(iii. 3), where Glo’ster's torch being seen in the distance, the fool
says, "Look, here comes a walking fire." Whereupon Edgar replies, "This
is the foul fiend, Flibbertigibbet; he begins at curfew, and walks till
the first cock." "From which," observes Mr Hunter, "Flibbertigibbet
seems to be a name for the will-o’-the-wisp. Hence the propriety of 'He
*begins at curfew*, and walks till the crowing of the cock,' that is, is
seen in all the dark of the night." It appears that when Shakespeare
wrote, "a walking fire" was a common name for the ignis fatuus, as we
learn from the story "How Robin Goodfellow lead a company of fellows out
of their way'':—A company of young men having been making merry with
their sweethearts, were, at their coming home, to come over a
heath—Robin Goodfellow, knowing of it, met them, and to make some
pastime hee led them up and downe the heathe a whole night, so that they
could not get out of it, for hee went

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

before them in the shape of a *walking fire*, which they all saw and
followed till the day did appeare, then Robin left them, and at his
departure spake these words:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Get you home, you merry lads,  
Tell your mammies and your dads,  
And all those that newes desire  
How you saw a walking fire,  
Wenches, that doe smile and lispe  
Use to call me willy-wispe."</span>

</div>

   Another allusion to this subject occurs in the "Tempest" (iv. 1),
where Stephano, after Ariel has led him and his drunken companions
through "tooth’d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns," and at
last "left them i’ the filthy mantled pool," reproaches Caliban in these
words—"Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done
little better than played the Jack with us"—that is, to quote Dr
Johnson's explanation of this passage "he has played
Jack-with-a-lanthorn, has led us about like an *ignis fatuus*, by which
travellers are decoyed into the mire." <span
id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_135.md) Once more, when Puck, in "Midsummer
Night's Dream" (iii. 1) speaks of the various forms he assumes in order
to "mislead night wanderers, laughing at their harm," he says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,  
 A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire."</span>

</div>

Shakespeare, no doubt, here alludes to the will-o’-the-wisp, an opinion
shared by Mr Joseph Ritson, <span id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_136.md) who
says—"This Puck, or Robin Goodfellow, seems likewise to be the illusory
candle-holder, so fatal to travellers, and who is more usually called
'Jack-a-lantern,' <span id="fr_137"></span>[3](#fn_137.md) or
'Will-with-a-wisp,' and 'Kit-with-the-can-stick.'"

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Milton in
"Paradise Lost" (b. ix.) alludes to this deceptive gleam in the

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                          "A wandering fire  
Compact of unctuous vapour, which the night  
Condenses, and the cold environs round,  
Kindled through agitation to a flame,  
Which oft, they say, some evil spirit attends,  
Hovering and blazing with delusive light,  
Misleads th’ amaz’d night-wanderer from his way  
To bogs and mires, and oft through pond and pool." <span
id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_138.md)</span>

</div>

   This appearance has given rise to a most extensive folklore, and is
embodied in many of the fairy legends and superstitions of this and
other countries. Thus, in Germany, Jack o’ Lanterns are said to be the
souls of unbaptized children, that have no rest in the grave, and must
hover between heaven and earth. In many places they are called
land-measurers, and are seen like figures of fire, running to and fro
with a red-hot measuring rod. These are said to be persons who have
falsely sworn away land, or fraudulently measured it, or removed
land-marks. <span id="fr_139"></span>[2](#fn_139.md) In the neighbourhood
of Magdeburg, they are known as "Lüchtemännekens; and to cause them to
appear, it is sufficient to call out "Ninove, Ninove." In the South
Altmark they are termed "Dickepôten;" and if a person only prays as soon
as he sees one, he draws it to him; if he curses, it retires. In some
parts, too, a popular name is "Huckepôten," and "Tuckbolde." The Jack o’
Lanterns of Denmark <span id="fr_140"></span>[3](#fn_140.md) are the
spirits of unrighteous men, who by a false glimmer, seek to mislead the
traveller , and to decoy him into bogs and moors. The best safeguard
against them, when they appear, is to turn one's cap inside out. A
similar notion occurs in Devonshire with regard to the Pixies, who
delight in leading astray such persons as they find abroad after
nightfall; the only remedy to escape them being to turn some part of the
dress. In Normandy, these fires are called "Feux Follets," and they are
believed to be

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

cruel spirits, whom it is dangerous to encounter. Among the
superstitions which prevail in connection with them, two, says Mr
Thoms, <span id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_141.md) are deserving of
notice:—"One is, that the ignis fatuus is the spirit of some unhappy
woman, who is destined to run *en furolle*, to expiate her intrigues
with a minister of the church, and it is designated from that
circumstance La Fourlore, or La Fourolle. Another opinion is, that Le
Feu Follet is the soul of a priest, who has been condemned thus to
expiate his broken vows of perpetual chastity; and it is very probable
that it is to some similar belief existing in this country at the time
when he wrote, that Milton alludes in "L’Allegro," when he says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"She was pinched and pulled, she said,  
 And he by Friar's Lanthorn led."</span>

</div>

In Brittany, the "Porte-brandon" appears in the form of a child bearing
a torch, which he turns like a burning wheel; and with this, we are
told, he sets fire to the villages, which are suddenly, sometimes in the
middle of the night, wrapped in flames.

   The appearance of meteors, Shakespeare ranks among omens, as in "1
Henry IV." (ii. 4), where Bardolph says:—"My lord, do you see these
meteors? do you behold these exhalations? what think you they portend?"
And in "King John" (iii. 4), Pandulph speaks of meteors as "prodigies
and signs." The Welsh Captain in "Richard II." (ii. 4), says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"’Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay,  
 The bay-trees in our country are all wither’d,  
 And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven."</span>

</div>

   *Comet*.—From the earliest times comets have been superstitiously
regarded, and ranked among omens. Thus Thucydides tells us, that the
Peloponnesian war was heralded by an abundance of earthquakes and
comets; and Virgil, in speaking of the death of Cæsar, declares that at
no other time did comets and other supernatural prodigies appear in
greater numbers. It is probably to this latter event that Shakespeare
alludes in "Julius Cæsar" (ii. 2), where he represents Calpurnia as
saying:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When beggars die, there are no comets seen;  
 The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Again, in "1 Henry
VI." (i. 1), the play opens with the following words uttered by the Duke
of Bedford:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to
night!  
 Comets, importing change of times and states,  
 Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,  
 And with them scourge the bad revolting stars  
 That have consented unto Henry's death!"</span>

</div>

In "Taming of the Shrew," too (iii. 2), Petruchio, when he makes his
appearance on his wedding-day, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "Gentles, methinks you frown:  
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,  
As if they saw some wondrous monument,  
Some comet, or unusual prodigy?"</span>

</div>

   In "1 Henry IV." (iii. 2), the king, when telling his son how he had
always avoided making himself "common-hackney’d in the eyes of men,"
adds—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By being seldom seen, I could not stir  
 But like a comet, I was wonder’d at."</span>

</div>

Arcite, in the "Two Noble Kinsmen" (v. 1), when addressing the altar of
Mars, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">        "Whose approach  
Comets forewarn."</span>

</div>

   *Dew*.—Amongst the many virtues ascribed to dew was its supposed
power over the complexion, a source of superstition which still finds
many believers, especially on May morning. <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_142.md)\* All dew, however, does not appear to
have possessed this quality—some being of a deadly or malignant quality.
Thus Ariel, in the "Tempest" (i. 2), speaks of the "deep brook" in the
harbour—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                             "Where once  
Thou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew  
From the still vex’d Bermoothes."</span>

</div>

And "Caliban" (i. 2), when venting his rage on Prospero and Miranda, can
find no stronger curse than the following

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As wicked dew as e’er my mother brush’d,  
 With raven's feather from unwholesome fen  
 Drop on you both!"</span>

</div>

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

It has been suggested that, in "Antony and Cleopatra" (iii. 12),
Shakespeare may refer to an old notion whereby the sea was considered
the source of dews as well as rain, Euphronius is represented as
saying:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Such as I am, I come from Antony:  
 I was of late as petty to his ends  
 As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf  
 To his grand sea."</span>

</div>

   According to an erroneous notion formerly current, it was supposed
that the air, and not the earth, drizzled dew—a notion referred to in
"Romeo and Juliet" (iii. 5):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle
dew."</span>

</div>

And in "King John" (ii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Before the dew of evening fall."</span>

</div>

Then there is the celebrated honey-dew, a substance which has furnished
the poet with a touching simile, which he has put into the mouth of
"Titus Andronicus" (iii. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears  
 Stood on her cheeks; as doth the honey-dew  
 Upon a gather’d lily almost wither’d."</span>

</div>

According to Pliny, "honey-dew" is the saliva of the stars, or a liquid
produced by the purgation of the air. It is, however, a secretion
deposited by a small insect, which is distinguished by the generic name
of Aphis. <span id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_143.md)

   *Rainbow*.—Secondary rainbows, the watery appearance in the sky
accompanying the rainbow, are in many places termed "water-galls"—a term
we find in the "Rape of Lucreece" \[1586–9\]:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And round about her tear-distained eye  
 Blue circles stream’d, like rainbows in the sky:  
 These water-galls in her dim element  
 Foretell new storms to those already spent."</span>

</div>

   Horace Walpole several times makes use of the word—"False good news
are always produced by true good, like the water-gall by the rainbow";
and again, "Thank heaven it is complete, and did not remain imperfect
like a water-gall." <span id="fr_144"></span>[2](#fn_144.md)

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In "The Dialect of
Craven" we find "Water-gall, a secondary or broken rainbow. *Germ*.
Wasser-galle."

   *Thunder*.—According to an erroneous fancy the destruction occasioned
by lightning was effected by some solid body known as the thunder-stone
or thunder-bolt. Thus in the beautiful dirge in "Cymbeline" (iv. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Guid*. Fear no more the lightning flash,  
 *Arv*. Or the all dreaded thunder-stone."</span>

</div>

   Othello asks (v. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "Are there no stones in heaven  
But what serve for the thunder?"</span>

</div>

   And in "Julius Cæsar" (i. 3) Cassius says

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,  
 Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone."</span>

</div>

   The thunder stone is the imaginary product of the thunder, which the
ancients called *Brontia*, mentioned by Pliny (Nat. Hist. xxxvii. 10) as
a species of gem, and as that which, falling with the lightning, does
the mischief. It is the fossil commonly called the Belemnite, or Finger
Stone, and now known to be a shell.

   A superstitious notion prevailed among the ancients, that those who
were stricken with lightning were honoured by Jupiter, and therefore to
be accounted holy. It is probably to this idea that Shakespeare alludes
in "Antony and Cleopatra" (ii. 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Some innocents ’scape not the thunderbolt." <span
id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_145.md)</span>

</div>

   The bodies of such were supposed not to putrify; and, after having
been exhibited for a certain time to the people, were not buried in the
usual manner, but interred on the spot where the lightning fell, and a
monument erected over them. Some, however, held a contrary opinion. Thus
Persius (Sat. ii. line 27), says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Triste jaces lucis evitandumque bidental."</span>

</div>

   The ground, too, that had been smitten by a thunderbolt was accounted
sacred, and afterwards enclosed; nor did anyone even presume to walk on
it. Such spots were, therefore,

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

consecrated to the gods, and could not in future become the property of
anyone.

   Among the many other items of folk-lore associated with thunder is a
curious one referred to in "Pericles" (iv. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thunder shall not so awake the beds of
eels."</span>

</div>

The notion formerly being that thunder had the effect of rousing eels
from their mud, and so rendered them more easy to be taken in stormy
weather. Marston alludes to this superstition in his satires ("Scourge
of Villainie," sat. vii.)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"They are nought but eeles, that never will
appeare  
 Till that tempestuous winds or thunder teare  
 Their slimy beds."</span>

</div>

   The silence that often precedes a thunder storm is thus graphically
described in "Hamlet" (ii. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">          "We often see, against some storm,  
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,  
The bold wind speechless, and the orb below  
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder  
Doth rend the region."</span>

</div>

   *Earthquakes*, around which so many curious myths and superstitions
have clustered, <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_146.md) are scarcely
noticed by Shakespeare. They are mentioned among the ominous signs of
that terrible night on which Duncan is so treacherously slain
("Macbeth," ii. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                           "The obscure bird  
Clamour’d the livelong night: some say, the earth  
Was feverous and did shake."</span>

</div>

And in "1 King Henry IV." (iii. 1) Hotspur assigns as a reason for the
earthquakes the following theory:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth  
 In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth  
 Is with a kind of colic pinch’d and vex’d  
 By the imprisoning of unruly wind  
 Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,  
 Shakes the old beldam earth, and topples down  
 Steeples, and moss-grown towers."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

   *Equinox*—The storms that prevail in spring at the vernal equinox are
aptly alluded to in "Macbeth" (i. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As whence the sun 'gins his reflection,  
 Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,  
 So from that spring whence comfort seem’d to come  
 Discomfort swells."</span>

</div>

—the meaning being:—the beginning of the reflexion of the sun is the
epoch of his passing from the severe to the milder season, opening,
however, with storms.

   *Wind*—An immense deal of curious weather lore <span
id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_147.md) has been associated with the wind from
the earliest period; and in our own and foreign countries innumerable
proverbs are found describing the future state of the weather from the
position of the wind, for, according to an old saying, "every wind has
its weather." Shakespeare has introduced some of these, showing how keen
an observer he was of those everyday sayings which have always been much
in use, especially among the lower classes. Thus the proverbial wet
which accompanies the wind when in the south is mentioned in "As you
Like It" (iii. 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Like foggy south puffing with wind and
rain."</span>

</div>

And again in "1 Henry IV." (v. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The southern wind  
 Doth play the trumpet to his (*i.e.* the sun's) purposes,  
 And by his hollow whistling in the leaves  
 Foretells a tempest and a blustering day."</span>

</div>

A popular saying to the same effect, still in use, tells us that—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When the wind is in the south,  
 It is in the rain's mouth."</span>

</div>

Again, in days gone by, the southerly winds were generally supposed to
be bearers of noxious fogs and vapours, frequent allusions to which are
given by Shakespeare. Thus in the "Tempest" (i. 2), Caliban says

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">        "A south-west blow on ye  
And blister you all o’er."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A book, <span
id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_148.md) too, with which, as already noticed,
Shakespeare appears to have been familiar, tells us, "This southern wind
is hot and moist. Southern winds corrupt and destroy; they heat, and
make men fall into the sickness." Hence, in "Troilus and Cressida" (v.
1), Thersites speaks of "the rotten diseases of the south;" and in
"Coriolanus" (i. 4), Marcius exclaims—"All the contagion of the south
light on you." Once more, in"Cymbeline" (ii. 3), Cloten speaks in the
same strain—"The south fog rot him."

   *Flaws*—These are sudden gusts of wind. It was the opinion, says
Warburton, "of some philosophers that the vapours being congealed in the
air by cold (which is the most intense in the morning), and being
afterwards rarefied and let loose by the warmth of the sun, occasion
those sudden and impetuous gusts of winds which were called 'flaws.'"
Thus he comments on the following passage in "2 Henry IV." (iv. 4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As humourous as winter and as sudden  
 As flaws congealed in the spring of day."</span>

</div>

In "2 Henry VI." (iii. 1), these outbursts of wind are further alluded
to—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage  
 Until the golden circuit on my head,  
 Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,  
 Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw."</span>

</div>

Again, in "Venus and Adonis" (425), there is an additional reference—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken’d  
 Wreck to the seaman, tempest to the field,  
 Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,  
 Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds."</span>

</div>

In the Cornish dialect a *flaw* signifies primitively a cut. <span
id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_149.md) But it is also there used in a secondary
sense for those sudden or cutting gusts of wind. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[3](#fn_150.md)

   *Squalls*.—There is a common notion that "the sudden

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

storm lasts not three hours," an idea referred to by John of Gaunt in
"Richard II." (ii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Small showers last long, but sudden storms are
short."</span>

</div>

Thus, in Norfolk, the peasantry say that "the faster the rain, the
quicker the hold up," which is only a difference in words from the
popular adage, "after a storm comes a calm."

   *Clouds*.—In days gone by, clouds floating before the wind, like a
reek or vapour, were termed racking clouds. Hence in "3 Henry VI." (ii.
1), Richard speaks of—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;  
 Not separated with the racking clouds."</span>

</div>

This verb though now obsolete, was formerly in common use; and in "King
Edward III.," 1596, we read:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">               "Like inconstant clouds,  
That, rack’d upon the carriage of the winds,  
Increase," &c.</span>

</div>

   At the present day one may often hear the phrase, the rack of the
weather, in our agricultural districts; many, too, of the items of
weather-lore noticed by Shakespeare being still firmly credited by our
peasantry.

says—"The wandering meteor of the moss or fell appears to have been
personified as Jack, Gill, Joan, Will, or Robin, indifferently,
according as the supposed spirit of the lamp seemed to the particular
rustic mind to be a male or female apparition." In Worcestershire it is
called "Hob-and-his-lanthorn," and "Hobany's," or "Hobnedy's-lanthorn."
