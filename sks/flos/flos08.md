<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the present chapter we have not only a
striking proof of Shakespeare's minute acquaintance with natural
history, but of his remarkable versatility as a writer. Whilst
displaying a most extensive knowledge of ornithology, he has further
illustrated his subject by alluding to those numerous legends, popular
sayings, and superstitions which have, in this and other countries,
clustered round the feathered race. Indeed, the following pages are
alone sufficient to show, if it were necessary, how fully he appreciated
every branch of antiquarian lore; and what a diligent student he must
have been in the pursuit of that wide range of information, the
possession of which has made him one of the most many-sided writers that
the world has ever seen. The numerous incidental allusions, too, by
Shakspeare, to the folk-lore of bygone days, whilst showing how deeply
he must have read and gathered knowledge from every available source,
serve as an additional proof of his retentive memory, and marvellous
power of embellishing his ideas by the most apposite illustrations.
Unfortunately, however, these have, hitherto, been frequently lost sight
of through the reader's unacquaintance with that extensive field of
folk-lore which was so well known to the poet. For the sake of easy
reference, the

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

birds with which the present chapter deals are arranged alphabetically.

   *Barnacle-Goose*.—There was a curious notion, very prevalent in
former times, that this bird (*Anser bernicla*) was generated from the
barnacle (*Leilas anatifera*), a shell-fish, growing on a flexible stem,
and adhering to loose timber, bottoms of ships, &c., a metamorphosis to
which Shakspeare alludes in the "Tempest" (iv. i), where he makes
Caliban say—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"We shall lose our time, And all be turn’d to
barnacles."</span>

</div>

   This vulgar error, no doubt, originated in mistaking the fleshy
peduncle of the shell-fish for the neck of a goose, the shell for its
head, and the tentacula for a tuft of feathers. These shell-fish,
therefore, bearing, as seen out of the water, a resemblance to the
goose's neck, were ignorantly, and without investigation, confounded
with geese themselves. In France, the barnacle-goose may be eaten on
fast days, by virtue of this old belief in its fishy origin. <span
id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151) Like other fictions this one had its
variations, <span id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_152) for sometimes the
barnacles were supposed to grow on trees, and thence to drop into the
sea, and become geese, as in Drayton's account of Furness, (*Polyolb*.
1622, Song 27, p. 1190). As early as the 12th century this idea <span
id="fr_153"></span>[3](#fn_153) was promulgated by Giraldus Cambrensis
in his "Topographia Hiberniæ." Gerarde, who in the year 1597 published
his "Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes," narrates the
following:—"There are found in the north parts of Scotland, and the
isles adjacent called Orcades, certain trees, whereon do grow certain
shell-fishes, of a white colour, tending to russet, wherein are
contained little living creatures; which shells in time of maturity do
open, and out of them grow those little living things, which, falling
into the water, do become fowls, whom we call barnacles, in the north of
England brant geese, and in Lancashire tree geese; but the others that
do fall upon the land perish, and do come to nothing. Thus much of the
writings of others, and also

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

from the mouths of people of those parts, which may very well accord
with truth. But what our eyes have seen and hands have touched, we shall
declare. There is a small island in Lancashire called the Pile of
Foulders, wherein are found the broken pieces of old ships, some whereof
have been cast thither by shipwreck, and also the trunks or bodies, with
the branches, of old rotten trees, cast up there likewise, whereon is
found a certain spume or froth, that in time breedeth into certain
shells, in shape like those of the mussel, but sharper pointed, and of a
whitish colour; wherein is contained a thing in form like a lace of
silk, one end whereof is fastened unto the inside of the shell, even as
the fish of oysters and mussels are. The other end is made fast unto the
belly of a rude mass or lump, which in time cometh to the shape and form
of a bird; when it is perfectly formed the shell gapeth open, and the
first thing that appeareth is the foresaid lace or string; next come the
legs of the bird hanging out, and as it groweth greater it openeth the
shell by degrees, till at length it is all come forth and hangeth only
by the bill. In short space after it cometh to full maturity, and
falleth into the sea, where it gathereth feathers and groweth to a fowl,
bigger than a mallard, and lesser than a goose; having black legs and
bill, or beak, and feathers black and white, spotted in such a manner as
is our magpie, which the people of Lancashire call by no other name than
a tree goose." An interesting cut of these birds so growing is given by
Mr Halliwell-Phillipps from a manuscript of the 14th century, who is of
opinion that the barnacle mentioned by Caliban was the tree-goose. It is
not to be supposed, however, that there were none who doubted this
marvellous story, or who took steps to refute it. Belon, so long ago as
1551, says Mr Harting, <span id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_154) and others
after him, treated it with ridicule, and a refutation may be found in
Willughby's "Ornithology," which was edited by Ray in 1678. <span
id="fr_155"></span>[2](#fn_155) This

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

vulgar error is mentioned by many of the old writers. Thus Bishop Hall,
in his "Virgidemiarum" (Lib. iv., sat. 2), says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The Scottish barnacle, if I might choose,  
 That of a worme doth waxe a winged goose."</span>

</div>

Butler, too, in his "Hudibras," (III., ii. 1. 655), speaks of it; and
Marston, in his "Malecontent," (1604), has the following:—"Like your
Scotch barnacle, now a block, instantly a worm, and presently a great
goose."

   *Blackbird*—This favourite is called in the "Midsummer Night's Dream"
(iii. 1.) an ousel, (old French, oisel), a term still used in the
neighbourhood of Leeds:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The ousel cock so black of hue,  
 With orange tawny bill."</span>

</div>

   In the 2d part of King Henry IV. (iii. 2) when Justice Shallow
inquires of Justice Silence, "And how doth my cousin?" he is answered—

   "Alas, a black ousel, <span id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_156) cousin
Shallow," a phrase which, no doubt, corresponded to our modern one, a
"black sheep." In Spenser's "Epithalamium" (1. 82), the word occurs—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The ousel shrills, the ruddock warbles
soft."</span>

</div>

   *Buzzard*.—Mr Staunton suggests that in the following passage of the
"Taming of the Shrew" (ii. 1), a play is intended upon the words, and
that in the second line, "buzzard" means a beetle from its peculiar
buzzing noise—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O slow-wing’d turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?  
 Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard."</span>

</div>

   The beetle was formerly called a buzzard; and in Staffordshire, a
cock-chafer is termed a hum-buz. In Northamptonshire, we find a proverb,
"I'm between a hawk and a buzzard," which means, "I don't know what to
do, or how to act." <span id="fr_157"></span>[2](#fn_157)

   *Chaffinch*.—Some think that this bird is alluded to in the song in
the "Midsummer Night's Dream" (iii. 1), where the expression "Finch" is
used; the chaffinch having always

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

been a favourite cage bird with the lower-classes. <span
id="fr_158"></span>[1](#fn_158) In "Troilus and Cressida" (v. 1),
Thersites calls Patroclus a "finch-egg," which was evidently meant as a
term of reproach. Others again consider the phrase is equivalent to
coxcomb.

   *Chough*.—In using this word, Shakespeare probably in most cases
meant the jackdaw; <span id="fr_159"></span>[2](#fn_159) for in "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" (iii. 2), he says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">       "Russet-pated choughs, many in sort,  
Rising and cawing at the gun's report."</span>

</div>

the term russet-pated being applicable to the jackdaw, but not to the
real chough. In "1 Henry IV." (v. 1), Prince Henry calls Falstaff
*chewet*—"Peace, chewet, peace"—in allusion no doubt to the chough or
jackdaw, for common birds have always had a variety of names. <span
id="fr_160"></span>[3](#fn_160) Such an appellation would be a proper
reproach to Falstaff, for his meddling and impertinent talk. Steevens,
and Malone, however, finding that *chewets* were little round pies made
of minced meat, thought that the Prince compared Falstaff for his
unseasonable chattering, to a minced pie. Cotgrave <span
id="fr_161"></span>[4](#fn_161) describes the French "chouette;" as an
owlet; also, a "chough," which many consider to be the simple and
satisfactory explanation of *chewet*. Belon in his "History of Birds"
(Paris, 1855), speaks of the *chouette* as the smallest kind of chough
or crow. Again, in "1 Henry IV." (ii. 2), in the amusing scene where
Falstaff, with the Prince and Poins, meet to rob the travellers at
Gadshill, Falstaff calls the victims "fat chuffs," probably, says Mr
Harting, who connects the word with chough, from their strutting about
with much noise. Nares, <span id="fr_162"></span>[5](#fn_162) too, in
his explanation

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

of *chuff*, says, that some suppose it to be from chough which is
similarly pronounced, and means a kind of sea-bird generally esteemed a
stupid one. Various other meanings are given. Thus, Mr Gifford <span
id="fr_163"></span>[1](#fn_163) affirms that chuff is always used in a
bad sense, and means "a coarse unmannered clown, at once sordid and
wealthy;" and Mr Halliwell-Phillipps explains it as spoken in contempt
for a fat person. <span id="fr_164"></span>[2](#fn_164) In
Northamptonshire, <span id="fr_165"></span>[3](#fn_165) we find the word
chuff used to denote a person in good condition, as in Clare's "Village
Minstrel"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"His chuff cheeks dimpling in a fondling
smile."</span>

</div>

Shakespeare alludes to the practice of teaching choughs to talk,
although from the following passages he does not appear to have esteemed
their talking powers of much value, for in "All's Well that Ends Well"
(iv. 1), he says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Choughs’ language, gabble enough, and good
enough."</span>

</div>

And in Tempest (ii. 1), he represents Antonio as saying—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "There be that can rule
Naples  
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate  
As amply and unnecessarily  
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make  
A chough of as deep chat."</span>

</div>

   Shakespeare always refers to the jackdaw as the "daw." <span
id="fr_166"></span>[4](#fn_166) The chough or jackdaw was one of the
birds considered ominous by our forefathers, an allusion to which occurs
in "Macbeth" (iii. 4.)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Augurs and understood relations have,  
 By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth  
 The secret’st man of blood."</span>

</div>

   At the present day this bird is not without its folklore, and there
is a Norwich rhyme to the following effect <span
id="fr_167"></span>[5](#fn_167)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When three daws are seen on St Peter's vane
together,  
 Then we're sure to have bad weather."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In the north, too,
of England <span id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_168) the flight of jackdaws
down the chimney is held to presage death.

   *Cock*.—The beautiful notion which represents the cock as crowing all
night long on Christmas Eve, and by its vigilance dispelling every kind
of malignant spirit <span id="fr_169"></span>[2](#fn_169) and evil
influence, is graphically mentioned in "Hamlet" (i. 1), where Marcellus,
speaking of the ghost, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"It faded on the crowing of the cock.  
 Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes,  
 Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,  
 The bird of dawning singeth all night long:  
 And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;  
 The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,  
 No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,  
 So hallow’d and so gracious is the time."</span>

</div>

In short, there is a complete prostration of the powers of darkness; and
thus, for the time being, mankind is said to be released from the
influence of all those evil forces which otherwise exert such sway. The
notion that spirits fly at cock-crow is very ancient, and is mentioned
by the Christian poet Prudentius, who flourished in the beginning of the
fourth century. There is also a hymn, said to have been composed by St
Ambrose, and formerly used in the Salisbury Service, which so much
resembles the following speech of Horatio (i. 1), that one might almost
suppose Shakespeare had seen it <span id="fr_170"></span>[3](#fn_170)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,  
 Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat  
 Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,  
 Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,  
 The extravagant and erring spirit hies  
 To his confine."</span>

</div>

   This disappearance of spirits at cock-crow is further alluded to (i.
2) <span id="fr_171"></span>[4](#fn_171)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The morning cock crew loud,  
 And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,  
 And vanish’d from our sight."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Blair, too, in his
"Grave" has these graphic words—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                            "The tale  
Of horrid apparition, tall and ghastly,  
That walks at dead of night, or takes his stand  
O’er some new-open’d grave, and strange to tell,  
Evanishes at crowing of the cock."</span>

</div>

   This superstition has not entirely died out in England, and a
correspondent of "Notes and Queries" <span
id="fr_172"></span>[1](#fn_172) relates an amusing legend current in
Devonshire:—"Mr N. was a squire who had been so unfortunate as to sell
his soul to the Devil, with the condition that after his funeral the
fiend should take possession of his skin. He had also persuaded a
neighbour to be present on the occasion of the flaying. On the death of
Mr N. this man went in a state of great alarm to the parson of the
parish and asked his advice. By him he was told to fulfil his
engagement, but he must be sure and carry a cock into the church with
him. On the night after the funeral the man proceeded to the church
armed with the cock, and, as an additional security, took up his
position in the parson's pew. At twelve o'clock the devil arrived,
opened the grave, took the corpse from the coffin, and flayed it. When
the operation was concluded he held the skin up before him and remarked,
'Well, ’twas not worth coming for after all, for it is all full of
holes!' As he said this, the cock crew, whereupon the fiend, turning
round to the man, exclaimed, 'If it had not been for the bird you have
got there under your arm, I would have your skin too!' But, thanks to
the cock, the man got home safe again." Various origins have been
assigned to this superstition, which Hampson <span
id="fr_173"></span>[2](#fn_173) regards as a misunderstood tradition of
some Sabæan fable. The cock, he adds, which seems by its early voice to
call forth the sun, was esteemed a sacred solar bird, hence it was also
sacred to Mercury, one of the personifications of the sun.

   A very general amusement up to the end of the last century was
cock-fighting, a diversion of which mention is occasionally made by
Shakespeare, as in "Antony and Cleopatra" (ii. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"His cocks do win the battle still of mine,  
 When it is all to nought."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And again Hamlet
says (v. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "O, I die, Horatio;  
The potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit"</span>

</div>

—meaning the poison triumphs over him, as a cock over his beaten
antagonist. Formerly, cock-fighting entered into the occupations of the
old and young. <span id="fr_174"></span>[1](#fn_174) Schools had their
cockfights. Travellers agreed with coachmen that they were to wait a
night if there was a cock-fight in any town through which they passed.
When country gentlemen had sat long at table, and the conversation had
turned upon the relative merits of their several birds, a cockfight
often resulted, as the birds in question were brought for the purpose
into the dining-room. Cock-fighting was practised on Shrove Tuesday to a
great extent, and, in the time of Henry VII., seems to have been
practised within the precincts of Court. The earliest mention of this
pastime in England is by Fitzstephens, in 1191. Happily, now-a-days,
cock-fighting is by law a misdemeanour, and punishable by penalty. One
of the popular terms for a cock beaten in a fight was "a craven," to
which we find a reference in the "Taming of the Shrew" (ii. 1)—"No cock
of mine; you crow too like a craven." We may also compare the expression
in Henry V. (iv. 7)—"He is a craven and a villain else." In the old
appeal or wager of battle, <span id="fr_175"></span>[2](#fn_175) in our
common law, we are told, on the authority of Lord Coke, that the party
who confessed himself wrong, or refused to fight, was to pronounce the
word *cravent*, and judgment was at once given against him. Singer <span
id="fr_176"></span>[3](#fn_176) says the term may be satisfactorily
traced from *crant*, *créant*, the old French word for an act of
submission. It is so written in the old metrical romance of "Ywaine and
Gawaine" (Ritson i. 133)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Or yelde the til us als creant."</span>

</div>

and in "Richard Coeur de Lion" (Weber ii. 208)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"On knees he fel down, and cryde, crêaunt."</span>

</div>

It then became *cravant*, *cravent*, and at length *craven*.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

   In the time of Shakespeare, the word *cock* was used as a vulgar
corruption or purposed disguise of the name of God, an instance of which
occurs in Hamlet (iv. 5)—"By cock, they are to blame." This irreverent
alteration of the sacred name is found at least a dozen times <span
id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_177) in Heywood's "Edward the Fourth," where
one passage is—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Herald*—Sweare on this booke, King Lewis, so help
you God,  
            You mean no otherwise then you have said.  
*King Lewis*—So helpe me Cock as I dissemble not."</span>

</div>

We find, too, other allusions to the sacred name, as in
"cock's-passion," "cock's-body;" as in "Taming of the Shrew" (iv.
i)—"Cock's passion, silence!" A not uncommon oath, too, in Shakespeare's
time was "Cock and pie"—*cock* referring to God, and *pie* being
supposed to mean the service-book of the Romish Church; a meaning which,
says Mr Dyce, seems much more probable than Douce's <span
id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_178) supposition that this oath was connected
with the making of solemn vows by knights in the days of chivalry,
during entertainments, at which a roasted peacock was served up. It is
used by Justice Shallow (2 Henry IV., v. 1)—"By cock and pye, sir, you
shall not away to-night." We may also compare the expression in the old
play of "Soliman and Perseda" (1599)—"By cock and pye and mousefoot." Mr
Harting <span id="fr_179"></span>[3](#fn_179) says the "Cock and Pye"
(*i.e.*, magpie) was an ordinary ale-house sign, and may have thus
become a subject for the vulgar to swear by.

   The phrase, "Cock-a-hoop," <span id="fr_180"></span>[4](#fn_180)
which occurs in "Romeo and Juliet" (i. 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"You'll make a mutiny among my guests!  
 You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!"</span>

</div>

—no doubt refers to a reckless person, who takes the cock or tap out of
a cask, and lays it on the top or hoop of the barrel, thus letting all
the contents of the cask run out. Formerly, a quart pot was called a
hoop, being formed of staves bound

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

together with hoops like barrels. There were generally three hoops to
such a pot; hence, in "2 Henry VI." (iv. 2), one of Jack Cade's popular
reformations was to increase their number, "The three-hooped pot shall
have ten hoops; and I will make it felony to drink small beer." Some,
however, consider the term Cock-a-hoop <span
id="fr_181"></span>[1](#fn_181) refers to the boastful crowing of the
cock.

   In "King Lear" (iii. 2) Shakespeare speaks of the "cataracts and
hurricanoes" as having—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks!"</span>

</div>

Vanes on the tops of steeples were in days gone by made in the form of a
cock—hence weathercocks—and put up, in papal times, to remind the clergy
of watchfulness. <span id="fr_182"></span>[2](#fn_182) Apart, too, from
symbolism, the large tail of the cock was well adapted to turn with the
wind. <span id="fr_183"></span>[3](#fn_183)

   *Cormorant*.—The proverbial voracity of this bird <span
id="fr_184"></span>[4](#fn_184) gave rise to a man of large appetite
being likened to it, a sense in which Shakespeare employs the word, as
in "Coriolanus" (i. 1)—"The cormorant belly;" in "Love's Labour's Lost"
(i. 1)—"Cormorant devouring time;" and in "Troilus and Cressida" (ii.
2)—"This cormorant war." "Although," says Mr Harting, <span
id="fr_185"></span>[5](#fn_185) "Shakespeare mentions the cormorant in
several of his plays, he has nowhere alluded to the sport of using these
birds, when trained, for fishing; a fact which is singular, since he
often speaks of the then popular pastime of hawking, and he did not die
until some years after James I. had made fishing with cormorants a
fashionable amusement."

   *Crow*.—This has from the earliest times been reckoned a bird of bad
omen; and in "Julius Cæsar," (v. 1), Cassius, on

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

the eve of battle, predicted a defeat, because, to use his own words:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                           "Crows and kites  
Fly o’er our heads and downward look on us,  
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem  
A canopy most fatal, under which  
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost."</span>

</div>

   Allusions to the same superstition occur in "Troilus and Cressida"
(i. 2); "King John" (v. 2), etc. Virgil (Bucolic i., 18), mentions the
croaking of the crow as a bad omen:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sæpe sinistra cava prædixit ab ilice
cornix."</span>

</div>

   And Butler in his "Hudibras" (part ii, canto 3), remarks:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Is it not ominous in all countries,  
 When crows and ravens croak upon trees."</span>

</div>

Even children now-a-days regard with no friendly feelings this bird of
ill-omen; <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_186) and in the north of
England there is a rhyme to the following effect:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Crow, crow, get out of my sight,  
 Or else I'll eat thy liver and lights."</span>

</div>

   Among other allusions, mentioned by Shakspeare, to the crow, may be
noticed the crow-keeper—a person employed to drive away crows from the
fields. At present, <span id="fr_187"></span>[2](#fn_187) in all the
midland counties, a boy set to drive away the birds is said to keep
birds; hence, a stuffed figure, now called a scare-crow, was also called
a crow-keeper, as in "King Lear" (iv. 6):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"That fellow handles his bow like a
crow-keeper."</span>

</div>

   One of Tusser's directions for September is—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"No sooner a-sowing, but out by-and-by,  
 With mother or boy that alarum can cry:  
 And let them be armed with a sling or a bow,  
 To scare away pigeon, the rook, or the crow."</span>

</div>

   In "Romeo and Juliet," (i. 4), a scare-crow seems meant—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,  
 Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

   Among further references to this practice, is that in "1 Henry VI."
(i. 4), where Lord Talbot relates that, when a prisoner in France, he
was publicly exhibited in the market-place:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Here, said they, is the terror of the French,  
 The scarecrow that affrights our children so." <span
id="fr_188"></span>[1](#fn_188)</span>

</div>

   And once more, in "Measure for Measure," (ii. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"We must not make a scare-crow of the law,  
 Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,  
 And let it keep one shape, till custom make it  
 Their perch and not their terror."</span>

</div>

   The phrase "to pluck a crow" is to complain good-naturedly but
reproachfully, and to threaten retaliation. <span
id="fr_189"></span>[2](#fn_189) It occurs in "Comedy of Errors," (iii.
1):—"We'll pluck a crow together." Sometimes the word pull is
substituted for pluck, as in Butler's "Hudibras," part ii. canto 2:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If not, resolve before we go  
 That you and I must pull a crow."</span>

</div>

   The crow has been regarded as the emblem of darkness, which has not
escaped the notice of Shakspeare, who in "Pericles" (iv. *introd*.),
speaking of the white dove, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"With the dove of Paphos might the crow  
 Vie feathers white." <span id="fr_190"></span>[3](#fn_190)</span>

</div>

   *Cuckoo*.—Many superstitions have clustered round the cuckoo, and
both in this country and abroad it is looked upon as a mysterious bird,
being supposed to possess the gift of second sight, a notion referred to
in "Love's Labour's Lost" (v. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Cuckoo, cuckoo: <span
id="fr_191"></span>[4](#fn_191) O word of fear,  
 Unpleasing to a married ear."</span>

</div>

   And again, in "Midsummer Night's Dream," (iii. 1), Bottom sings:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The plain-song cuckoo gray,  
 Whose note full many a man doth mark,  
 And dares not answer nay."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

   It is still a common idea that the cuckoo, if asked, will tell
anyone, by the repetition of its cries, how long he has to live. The
country lasses in Sweden count the cuckoo's call to ascertain how many
years they have to remain unmarried, but they generally shut their ears
and run away on hearing it a few times. <span
id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_192) Among the Germans the notes of the
cuckoo, when heard in spring for the first time, are considered a good
omen. Cæsarius (A.D. 1222), tells us of a convertite who was about to
become a monk, but changed his mind on hearing the cuckoo's call, and
counting twenty-two repetitions of it. "Come," said he, "I have
certainly twenty-two years still to live, and why should I mortify
myself during all that time. I will go back to the world, enjoy its
delights for twenty years, and devote the remaining two to
penitence." <span id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_193) In England, the
peasantry salute the cuckoo with the following invocation:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Cuckoo, cherry-tree,  
 Good bird tell me,  
 How many years have I to live."</span>

</div>

the allusion to the cherry-tree having probably originated in the
popular fancy, that before the cuckoo ceases its song, it must eat three
good meals of cherries. Pliny mentions the belief, that when the cuckoo
came to maturity, it devoured the bird which had reared it; a
superstition several times alluded to by Shakespeare. Thus, in "King
Lear," (i. 4) the Fool remarks—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,  
 That it's had it head bit off by it young."</span>

</div>

Again, in "1 Henry IV." (v. 1), Worcester says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And being fed by us you used us so  
 As that ungentle gull, the cuckoo's bird,  
 Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;  
 Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk  
 That even our love durst not come near your sight  
 For fear of swallowing."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

   Once more, the opinion that the cuckoo made no nest of its own, but
laid its eggs in that of another bird, is mentioned in "Antony and
Cleopatra" (ii. 6):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou dost o’er-count me of my father's house;  
 But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,  
 Remain in’t as thou mayst."</span>

</div>

It has been remarked, <span id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_194) however, in
reference to the common idea that the young cuckoo illtreats its foster
mother, that if we watch the movements of the two birds, when the
younger is being fed, we cannot much wonder at this piece of folk-lore.
When the cuckoo opens its great mouth, the diminutive nurse places her
own head so far within its precincts, that it has the exact appearance
of a voluntary surrender to decapitation.

   The notion <span id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_195) "which couples the
name of the cuckoo with the character of the man whose wife is
unfaithful to him, appears to have been derived from the Romans, and is
first found in the middle ages in France, and in the countries of which
the modern language is derived from the Latin. But the ancients more
correctly gave the name of the bird, not to the husband of the faithless
wife, but to her paramour, who might justly be supposed to be acting the
part of the cuckoo. They applied the name of the bird in whose nest the
cuckoo's eggs were usually deposited—'carruca'—to the husband. It is not
quite clear how, in the passage from classic to mediæval, the
application of the term was transferred to the husband." In further
allusion to this bird, we may quote the following from "All's Well that
Ends Well" (i. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For I the ballad will repeat,  
 Which men full true will find,  
 Your marriage comes by destiny,  
 Your cuckoo sings by kind."</span>

</div>

   The cuckoo has generally been regarded as the harbinger of spring,
and according to a Gloucestershire rhyme—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The cuckoo comes in April,  
 Sings a song in May;  
 Then in June another tune,  
 And then she flies away."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thus, in "1 Henry
IV." (iii. 2), Henry IV., alluding to his predecessor, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"So when he had occasion to be seen,  
 He was but as the cuckoo is in June,  
 Heard, not regarded."</span>

</div>

   In "Love's Labour's Lost" (v. 2), spring is maintained by the cuckoo,
in those charming sonnets descriptive of the beauties of the country at
this season.

   The word cuckoo has, from the earliest times, been used as a term of
reproach; <span id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_196) and Plautus <span
id="fr_197"></span>[2](#fn_197) has introduced it on more than one
occasion. In this sense we find it quoted by Shakespeare in "1 Henry
IV." (ii. 4):—"O’ horseback, ye cuckoo." The term *cuckold*, too, which
so frequently occurs throughout Shakespeare's Plays, is generally
derived from cuculus; <span id="fr_198"></span>[3](#fn_198) from the
practice already alluded to of depositing its eggs in other birds’
nests.

   *Domestic Fowl*.—In the "Tempest" (v. 1), the word chick is used as a
term of endearment, "Nay arise, chick, &c.;" and in "Macbeth" (iv. 3),
Macduff speaks of his children as "all my pretty chickens." In
"Coriolanus" (v. 3), hen is applied to a woman—"Poor hen, fond of no
second brood;" and in "Taming of the Shrew" (ii. 1), Petruchio says, "So
Kate will be my hen;" and, once more, "1 Henry IV." (iii. 3), Falstaff
says, "How now, Dame Partlet, the hen?" In "Othello" (i. 3), Iago
applies the term "guinea-hen" to Desdemona, a cant phrase in
Shakespeare's day for a fast woman.

   *Dove*.—Among the many beautiful allusions to this bird we may
mention one in "Hamlet" (v. 1), where Shakespeare speaks of the dove
only laying two eggs. <span id="fr_199"></span>[4](#fn_199)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As patient as the female dove  
 When that her golden couplets are disclosed."</span>

</div>

The young nestlings, when first disclosed, are only covered with a
yellow down, and the mother rarely leaves the nest, in

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

consequence of the tenderness of her young; hence the dove has been made
an emblem of patience. In "2 Henry IV." (iv. 1), it is spoken of as the
symbol of peace—"The dove, and very blessed spirit of peace;" and in the
"Taming of the Shrew" (ii. 1), we find the expression "as modest as the
dove." Its love, too, is several times referred to, as in "Romeo" (ii.
1), "Pronounce but—'love' and 'dove';" and in "1 Henry VI." (ii. 2),
Burgundy says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves,  
 That could not live asunder day or night."</span>

</div>

This bird has, also, been regarded as the emblem of fidelity, as in the
following graphic passage in "Troilus and Cressida" (iii. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,  
 As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,  
 As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre."</span>

</div>

and in "Winter's Tale" (iv. 4), we read—"Turtles pair, that never mean
to part." Its modesty is alluded to in the "Taming of the Shrew" (ii.
1)—"Modest as the dove;" and its innocence in "2 Henry VI." (iii. 1), is
mentioned, where King Henry says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent  
 From meaning treason to our royal person  
 As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:  
 The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given  
 To dream on evil or to work my downfall."</span>

</div>

The custom of giving a pair of doves or pigeons as a present or
peace-offering, is alluded to in "Titus Andronicus" (iv. 4), where the
Clown says, "God and Saint Stephen give you good den: I have brought you
a letter and a couple of pigeons here;" and when Gobbo tried to find
favour with Bassanio in "Merchant of Venice" (ii. 2), he began by
saying—"I have here a dish of doves, that I would bestow on your
worship." Shakespeare alludes in several places to the "doves of Venus,"
as in "Venus and Adonis:"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thus weary of the world, away she (Venus) hies,  
 And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid  
 Their mistress mounted through the empty skies  
 In her light chariot quickly is conveyed;  
 Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen  
 Means to immure herself and not be seen."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

and in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (i. 1), where Hermia speaks of "the
simplicity of Venus’ doves." This will also explain, says Mr
Harting, <span id="fr_200"></span>[1](#fn_200) the reference to "the
dove of Paphos" in "Pericles" (iv., *Introduction*). The towns of Old
and New Paphos are situated on the south-west extremity of the coast of
Cyprus. Old Paphos is the one generally referred to by the poets, being
the peculiar seat of the worship of Venus, who was fabled to have been
wafted thither, after her birth amid the waves. The "dove of Paphos" may
therefore be considered as synonymous with the "dove of Venus."

   Mahomet, we are told, had a dove, which he used to feed with wheat
out of his ear; when hungry, the dove lighted on his shoulder, and
thrust its bill in to find its breakfast;—Mahomet persuading the rude
and simple Arabians that it was the Holy Ghost that gave him
advice. <span id="fr_201"></span>[2](#fn_201) Hence, in "1 Henry VI."
(i. 2), the question is asked—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?"</span>

</div>

   *Duck*.—A barbarous pastime in Shakespeare's time was hunting a tame
duck in the water with spaniels. For the performance of this amusement
it was necessary <span id="fr_202"></span>[3](#fn_202) to have recourse
to a pond of water sufficiently extensive to give the duck plenty of
room for making its escape from the dogs when closely pursued: which it
did by diving as often as any of them came near it, hence the following
allusion in "Henry V." (ii. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck." <span
id="fr_203"></span>[4](#fn_203)</span>

</div>

   "To swim like a duck" is a common proverb, which occurs in the
"Tempest" (ii. 2), where Trinculo, in reply to Stephano's question how
he escaped, says: "Swum ashore, man, like a duck; I can swim like a
duck, I'll be sworn."

   *Eagle*.—From the earliest time this bird has been associated with
numerous popular fancies and superstitions, many of which have not
escaped the notice of Shakspeare. A

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

notion of very great antiquity attributes to it the power of gazing at
the sun undazzled, to which Spenser in his "Hymn of Heavenly Beauty"
refers:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And like the native brood of eagle's kind,  
 On that bright sun of glory fix thine eyes."</span>

</div>

   In "Love's Labour's Lost," (iv. 3), Biron says of Rosaline:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What peremptory eagle-sighted eye  
 Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,  
 That is not blinded by her majesty?" <span
id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_204)</span>

</div>

   And in 3 Henry VI. (ii. 1), Richard says to Edward, Prince of Wales:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,  
 Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun."</span>

</div>

   The French naturalist, Lacepede, <span
id="fr_205"></span>[2](#fn_205) has calculated that the clearness of
vision in birds is nine times more extensive than that of the
farthest-sighted man. The eagle, too, has always been proverbial for its
great power of flight, and on this account has had assigned to it the
sovereignty of the feathered race. Aristotle and Pliny both record the
legend of the wren disputing for the crown, a tradition which is still
found in Ireland: <span id="fr_206"></span>[3](#fn_206)—The birds all
met together one day and settled among themselves that whichever of them
could fly highest was to be the king of them all. Well, just as they
were starting, the little rogue of a wren perched itself on the eagle's
tail. So they flew and flew ever so high, till the eagle was miles above
all the rest, and could not fly another stroke, for he was so tired.
"Then," says he, "I'm the king of the birds," says he; "hurroo!" "You
lie," says the wren, darting up a perch and a-half above the big fellow.
The eagle was so angry to think how he was outwitted by the wren, that
when the latter was coming down he gave him a stroke of his wing, and
from that day the wren has never been able to fly higher than a hawthorn
bush. The swiftness

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

of the eagle's flight is spoken of in "Timon of Athens," (i. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">  "An eagle flight, bold, and forth on,  
Leaving no track behind." <span id="fr_207"></span>[1](#fn_207)</span>

</div>

   The great age, too, of the eagle is well known; and the words of the
psalmist are familiar to most readers:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"His youth shall be renewed like the
eagle's."</span>

</div>

   Apemantus, however, asks of Timon ("Timon of Athens," iv. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "Will these moss’d trees,  
That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,  
And skip where thou point’st out?"</span>

</div>

   Tuberville, in his "Book of Falconry," 1575, says that the great age
of this bird has been ascertained from the circumstance of its always
building its eyrie or nest in the same place. The Romans considered the
eagle a bird of good omen, and its presence in time of battle was
supposed to foretell victory. Thus, in "Julius Cæsar," (v. 1), we read:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign  
 Two mighty eagles fell; and there they perch’d,  
 Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands."</span>

</div>

   It was selected for the Roman legionary standard, <span
id="fr_208"></span>[2](#fn_208) through being the king and most powerful
of all birds. As a bird of good omen it is mentioned also in
"Cymbeline," (i. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I chose an eagle, and did avoid a puttock."</span>

</div>

and in another scene (iv. 2), the Soothsayer relates how "Last night the
very gods shew’d me a vision": thus:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing’d  
 From the spongy south to this part of the west,  
 There vanish’d in the sunbeams: which portends  
 (Unless my sins abuse my divination),  
 Success to th’ Roman host."</span>

</div>

   The conscious superiority <span id="fr_209"></span>[3](#fn_209) of
the eagle is depicted by Tamora in "Titus Andronicus," (iv. 4):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The eagle suffers little birds to sing,  
 And is not careful what they mean thereby,  
 Knowing that with the shadow of his wing,  
 He can at pleasure stint their melody."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

   *Goose*.—This bird was the subject <span
id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_210) of many quaint proverbial phrases often
used in the old popular writers. Thus, a tailor's goose was a jocular
name for his pressing iron, probably from its being often roasting
before the fire, an allusion to which occurs in "Macbeth," (ii. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Come in, tailor; here you may roast your
goose."</span>

</div>

The "wild-goose chase," which is mentioned in "Romeo and Juliet" (ii.
4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Mercutio*—Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose
chase, I have done."</span>

</div>

—was a kind of horse-race, which resembled the flight of wild-geese. Two
horses were started together, and whichever rider could get the lead,
the other was obliged to follow him over whatever ground the foremost
jockey chose to go. That horse which could distance the other won the
race. This reckless sport is enumerated by Burton, in his "Anatomy of
Melancholy," as a recreation much in vogue in his time among gentlemen.
The term, "Winchester goose," was a cant phrase for a certain venereal
disease, because the stews in Southwark were under the jurisdiction of
the Bishop of Winchester, to whom Gloucester tauntingly applies the term
in the following passage ("1 Henry VI.," i. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!"</span>

</div>

In "Troilus and Cressida" (v. 10), there is a further allusion—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss."</span>

</div>

Ben Jonson <span id="fr_211"></span>[2](#fn_211) calls it—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">   "The Winchestrian goose,  
Bred on the banke in time of Popery,  
When Venus there maintain’d the mystery."</span>

</div>

   "Plucking geese" was formerly a barbarous sport of boys ("Merry Wives
of Windsor," v. 1), which consisted in stripping a living goose of its
feathers. <span id="fr_212"></span>[3](#fn_212)

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

   In "Coriolanus" (i. 4), the goose is spoken of as the emblem of
cowardice. Marcius says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "You souls of geese,  
That hear the shapes of men, how have you run  
From slaves that apes would beat."</span>

</div>

   *Goldfinch*.—The Warwickshire name <span
id="fr_213"></span>[1](#fn_213) for this bird is "Proud Tailor," to
which, some commentators think, the words in "1 Henry IV." (iii. 1)
refer

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Lady P.*—I will not sing.  
 *Hotsp*.—’Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast
teacher."</span>

</div>

It has, therefore, been suggested that the passage should be read
thus—"’Tis the next way to turn tailor, or red-breast teacher," *i.e.*,
"to turn teacher of goldfinches or redbreasts." <span
id="fr_214"></span>[2](#fn_214) Singer, <span
id="fr_215"></span>[3](#fn_215) however, explains the words
thus—"Tailors, like weavers, have ever been remarkable for their vocal
skill. Percy is jocular in his mode of persuading his wife to sing; and
this is a humorous turn which he gives to his argument, 'Come, sing.' 'I
will not sing.' '’Tis the next (*i.e.*, the readiest, nearest) way to
turn tailor, or redbreast teacher'—the meaning being, to sing is to put
yourself upon a level with tailors and teachers of birds."

   *Gull*.—Shakespeare often uses this word as synonymous with fool.
Thus in Henry V. (iii. 6), he says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Why, ’tis a gull, a fool."</span>

</div>

The same play upon the word occurs in "Othello" (v. 2), and in "Timon of
Athens" (ii. 1). In "Twelfth Night" (v. 1), Malvolio asks—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Why have you suffer’d me to be imprison’d,  
 Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,.  
 And made the most notorious geck and gull  
 That e’er invention played on? tell me why."</span>

</div>

It is also used to express a trick or imposition, as in "Much Ado About
Nothing" (ii. 3)—"I should think this a gull,

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it." <span
id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_216) "Gull-catchers," or "gull-gropers," to
which reference is made in "Twelfth Night"(ii. 5), where Fabian, on the
entry of Maria, exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Here comes my noble gull-catcher."</span>

</div>

were the names by which sharpers <span id="fr_217"></span>[2](#fn_217)
were known in Shakespeare's time. <span id="fr_218"></span>[3](#fn_218)
The "gull-catcher" was generally an old usurer, who lent money to a
gallant at an ordinary, who had been unfortunate in play. <span
id="fr_219"></span>[4](#fn_219) Decker devotes a chapter to this
character in his "Lanthorne and Candle-light," 1612. According to him,
"the gull-groper is commonly an old monymonger, who having travailed
through all the follyes of the world in his youth, knowes them well, and
shunnes them in his age, his whole felicitie being to fill his bags with
golde and silver." The person so duped was termed a gull, and the trick
also. In that disputed passage in the "Tempest" (ii. 2), where Caliban,
addressing Trinculo, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">        "Sometimes I'll get thee  
Young scamels from the rock."</span>

</div>

some think that the sea-mew, or sea-gull, is intended, <span
id="fr_220"></span>[5](#fn_220) sea-mall, or sea-mell, being still a
provincial name for this bird. Mr Stevenson, in his "Birds of Norfolk"
(ii. p. 260), tells us that "the female bar-tailed godwit is called a
'scammell' by the gunners of Blakeney. But as this bird is not a
rock-breeder, <span id="fr_221"></span>[6](#fn_221) it cannot be the one
intended in the present passage, if we regard it as an accurate
description from a naturalist's point of view." Holt says that "scam" is
a limpet, and scamell probably a diminutive. Mr Dyce <span
id="fr_222"></span>[7](#fn_222) reads "Scamels," *i.e.*, the kestrel,
stannel, or windhover, which breeds in rocky situations, and high cliffs
on our coasts. He also further observes

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

that this accords well with the context "from the rock," and adds that
staniel or staunyel occurs in "Twelfth Night" (ii. 5), where all the old
editions exhibit the gross misprint, "stallion."

   *Hawk*.—The diversion of catching game with hawks was very popular in
Shakespeare's time, <span id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_223) and hence, as
might be expected, we find many scattered allusions to it throughout his
plays. The training of a hawk for the field was an essential part of the
education of a young Saxon nobleman; and the present of a well-trained
hawk was a gift to be welcomed by a king. Edward the Confessor spent
much of his leisure time in either hunting or hawking; and in the reign
of Edward III. we read how the Bishop of Ely attended the service of the
church at Bermondsey, Southwark, leaving his hawk in the cloister, which
in the meantime was stolen—the bishop solemnly excommunicating the
thieves. On one occasion Henry VIII. met with a serious accident when
pursuing his hawk at Hitchin in Hertfordshire. In jumping over a ditch,
his pole broke, and he fell headlong into the muddy-water, where he was
with some difficulty rescued by one of his followers. Sir Thomas Moore,
writing in the reign of Henry VIII., describing the state of manhood,
makes a young man say—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Man-hod I am, therefore I me delyght  
 To hunt and hawke, to nourish up and fede  
 The greyhounde to the course, the hawke to th’ flight,  
 And to bestryde a good and lusty stede."</span>

</div>

   In noticing then, Shakespeare's allusions to this sport, we have a
good insight into its various features, and also gain a knowledge of the
several terms associated with it. Thus frequent mention is made of the
word "haggard"—a wild untrained hawk—and in the following allegory
("Taming of the Shrew," iv. 1), where it occurs, much of the knowledge
of falconry is comprised:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;  
 And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged, <span
id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_224)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"> <span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span> For then she never looks upon her lure.  
 Another way I have to man my haggard,  
 To make her come and know her keeper's call,  
 That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites,  
 That bate and beat and will not be obedient.  
 She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;  
 Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not." <span
id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_225)</span>

</div>

   Further allusions occur in "Twelfth Night" (iii. 1), where Viola says
of the Clown:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;  
 And to do that well craves a kind of wit:  
 He must observe their mood on whom he jests,  
 The quality of persons, and the time,  
 And, like the haggard, check at every feather  
 That comes before his eye."</span>

</div>

   In "Much Ado about Nothing," Hero (iii. 1), speaking of Beatrice says
that—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">  "her spirits are as coy and wild  
As haggerds of the rock."</span>

</div>

   And Othello (iii. 3), mistrusting Desdemona, and likening her to a
hawk, exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">      "If I do prove her haggard,—  
I’ld whistle her off." <span id="fr_226"></span>[2](#fn_226)</span>

</div>

   The word "check" alluded to above was a term in falconry applied to a
hawk when she forsook her proper game and followed some other of
inferior kind that crossed her in her flight <span
id="fr_227"></span>[3](#fn_227)—being mentioned again in Hamlet (iv. 7),
where the king says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">            "If he be now return’d,  
As checking at his voyage." <span id="fr_228"></span>[4](#fn_228)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

   Another common expression used in falconry is "tower," applied to
certain hawks, etc., which tower aloft, soar spirally to a height in the
air, and thence swoop upon their prey. In "Macbeth" (ii. 4), we read of
"a falcon, towering in her pride of place;" in "2 Henry VI." (ii. 1),
Suffolk says, "My lord protector's hawks do tower so well;" and in "King
John" (v. 2), the Bastard says, "And, like an eagle o’er his aery <span
id="fr_229"></span>[1](#fn_229) towers."

   The word "quarry" which occurs several times in Shakespeare's plays,
in some instances, means the "game or prey sought." The etymology has,
says Nares, been variously attempted, but with little success. It may,
perhaps, originally have meant the square, or inclosure (carrée) into
which the game was driven (as is still practised in other countries),
and hence the application of it to the game there caught, would be a
natural extension of the term. Randle Holme, in his "Academy of Armory"
(Book II., c. xi. p. 240), defines it as "the fowl which the hawk flyeth
at, whether dead or alive." It was also equivalent to a heap of
slaughtered game, as in the following passages. In "Coriolanus" (i. 1),
Caius Marcius says—"I’ld make a quarry with thousands of these quarter’d
slaves." In "Macbeth" (iv. 3) <span id="fr_230"></span>[2](#fn_230) we
read "The quarry of these murder’d deer," and in "Hamlet" (v. 2), "This
quarry cries on havoc."

   Another term in falconry is "stoop," or "swoop,'' denoting the hawk's
violent descent from a height upon its prey. In "Taming of the Shrew"
(iv. 1) the expression occurs, "Till she stoop, she must not be
full-gorged." In "Henry V." (iv. 1), King Henry, speaking of the king,
says, "Though his affections are higher mounted than ours, yet when they
stoop, they stoop with the like wing." In "Macbeth,"

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

too (iv. 3), Macduff, referring to the cruel murder of his children,
exclaims, "What! at one fell swoop?" <span
id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_231) Webster, in the "White Devil," <span
id="fr_232"></span>[2](#fn_232) says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If she \[*i.e.*, Fortune\] give aught, she deals it
in small parcels,  
 That she may take away all at one swoop."</span>

</div>

   Shakespeare gives many incidental allusions to the hawk's trappings.
Thus in "Lucreece" he says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells  
 With trembling fear, as fowl hear falcon's bells."</span>

</div>

And in "As You Like It" (iii. 3) <span id="fr_233"></span>[3](#fn_233),
Touchstone says, "As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb, and
the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires." The object of these
bells was to lead the falconer to the hawk when in a wood or out of
sight. In Heywood's play entitled, "A Woman Killed with Kindness," 1617,
is a hawking scene, containing a striking allusion to the hawk's bells.
The dress of the hawk <span id="fr_234"></span>[4](#fn_234) consisted of
a close-fitting hood of leather or velvet, enriched with needle-work,
and surmounted with a tuft of coloured feathers, for use as well as
ornament, inasmuch as they assisted the hand in removing the hood when
the birds for the hawk's attack came in sight. Thus in "Henry V." (iii.
7), the Constable of France, referring to the valour of the Dauphin,
says, "’Tis a hooded valour, and when it appears it will bate." <span
id="fr_235"></span>[5](#fn_235) And again, in "Romeo and Juliet" (iii.
2), Juliet says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hood my unmann’d blood, bating <span
id="fr_236"></span>[6](#fn_236) in my cheeks."</span>

</div>

   The "jesses" were two short straps of leather or silk, which were
fastened to each leg of a hawk, to which was attached

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

a swivel from which depended the leash or strap which the falconer <span
id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_237) twisted round his hand. Othello (iii.
3), says

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Though that her jesses were my dear
heart-strings."</span>

</div>

   We find several allusions to the training of hawks. <span
id="fr_238"></span>[2](#fn_238) They were usually trained by being kept
from sleep, it having been customary for the falconers to sit up by
turns and "watch" the hawk, and keep it from sleeping, sometimes for
three successive nights. Desdemona in "Othello" (iii. 3), says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                    "My lord shall never rest;  
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;  
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;  
I'll intermingle every thing he does  
With Cassio's suit."</span>

</div>

   So in Cartwright's "Lady Errant" (ii. 2),—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"We'll keep you as they do hawks,  
 Watching until you leave your wildness."</span>

</div>

   In "The Merry Wives of Windsor" (v. 5), where Page says

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nay, do not fly: I think we have watch’d you
now"</span>

</div>

the allusion is, says Staunton, to this method employed to tame or
"reclaim" hawks.

   Again, in "Othello" (iii. 3), <span id="fr_239"></span>[3](#fn_239)
Iago exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"She that, so young, could give out such a
seeming,  
 To seel her father's eyes up close as oak;"</span>

</div>

in allusion to the practice of seeling a hawk, or sewing up its eyelids,
by running a fine thread through them, in order to make her tractable
and endure the hood of which we have already spoken. Henry IV. ("2 Henry
IV." iii. 1), in his soliloquy on sleep, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast  
 Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains  
 In cradle of the rude imperious surge." <span
id="fr_240"></span>[4](#fn_240)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

   In Spenser's "Fairie Queen," (I. vii. 23), we read:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Mine eyes no more on vanity shall feed,  
 But sealed up with death, shall have their deadly meed."</span>

</div>

   It was a common notion, that if a dove was let loose with its eyes so
closed, it would fly straight upwards, continuing to mount, till it fell
down through mere exhaustion. <span id="fr_241"></span>[1](#fn_241)

   In "Cymbeline," (iii. 4), Imogen, referring to Posthumus, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                         "I grieve myself  
To think, when thou shall be disedged by her  
That now thou tirest on,"</span>

</div>

this passage containing two metaphorical expressions from falconry. A
bird was said to be *disedged* when the keenness of its appetite was
taken away by *tiring*, or feeding upon some tough or hard substance
given to it for that purpose. In "3 Henry VI." (i. 1), the king says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                        "That hateful duke,  
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,  
Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle  
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son."</span>

</div>

   In "Timon of Athens," (iii. 6), one of the lords says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we
encountered."</span>

</div>

   In "Venus and Adonis," too, we find a further allusion:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,  
Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh, and bone," &c.</span>

</div>

   Among other allusions to the hawk, may be mentioned one in "Measure
for Measure," (iii. i):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "This outward-sainted deputy,  
Whose settled visage and deliberate word  
Nips youth i’ th’ head and follies doth emmew,  
As falcon doth the fowl."</span>

</div>

—the word "emmew" signifying the place where hawks were shut up during
the time they moulted. In "Romeo and Juliet," (iii. 4), Lady Capulet
says of Juliet:—"To-night she is mew’d up to her heaviness;" and in
"Taming of Shrew," (i. 1), Gremio speaking of Bianca to Signor Baptista,
says:—"Why will you mew her?"

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

   When the wing or tail feathers of a hawk were dropped, forced out, or
broken, by any accident, it was usual to supply or repair as many as
were deficient or damaged, an operation called "to imp <span
id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_242) a hawk." Thus in Richard II. (ii. 1),
Northumberland says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,  
 Imp out our drooping country's broken wing."</span>

</div>

So Massinger in his "Renegado" (v. 8), makes Asambeg say—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                 "Strive to imp  
New feathers to the broken wings of time."</span>

</div>

   Hawking was sometimes called birding. <span
id="fr_243"></span>[2](#fn_243) In the "Merry Wives of Windsor," (iii.
3), Master Page says:—"I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house to
breakfast; after, we'll a-birding together, I have a fine hawk for the
bush." In the same play (iii. 5), Dame Quickly, speaking of Mistress
Ford, says:—"Her husband goes this morning a-birding;" and Mistress Ford
says (iv. 2):—"He's a-birding, sweet St John." The word hawk, says Mr
Harting, is invariably used by Shakspeare in its generic sense; and in
only two instances does he allude to a particular species. These are the
kestrel and sparrowhawk. In "Twelfth Night," (ii. 5), Sir Toby Belch,
speaking of Malvolio, as he finds the letter which Maria has purposely
dropped in his path, says

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And with what wing the staniel <span
id="fr_244"></span>[3](#fn_244) checks at it."</span>

</div>

—staniel being a corruption of stangdall, a name for the kestrel
hawk. <span id="fr_245"></span>[4](#fn_245) "Gouts" is the technical
term for the spots on some parts of the plumage of a hawk, and perhaps
Shakspeare uses the word in allusion to a phrase in heraldry. Macbeth
(ii. 1), speaking of the dagger, says:—"I see thee still, and on thy
blade and dudgeon gouts of blood."

   *Heron*.—This bird was frequently flown at by falconers. Shakespeare,
in "Hamlet" (ii. 2), makes Hamlet say, "I am

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

but mad north-north-west; when the wind is southerly, I know a hawk from
a handsaw;" handsaw being a corruption of "heronshaw," or "hernsew,"
which is still used, in the provincial dialects, for a heron. In Suffolk
and Norfolk it is pronounced "harnsa," from which to "handsaw," is but a
single step. <span id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_246) Shakespeare here
alludes to a proverbial saying, "He knows not a hawk from a
handsaw." <span id="fr_247"></span>[2](#fn_247) Mr J. C. Heath <span
id="fr_248"></span>[3](#fn_248) explains the passage thus: "The
expression obviously refers to the sport of hawking. Most birds,
especially one of heavy flight like the heron, when roused by the
falconer or his dog, would fly down or with the wind, in order to
escape. When the wind is from the north, the heron flies towards the
south, and the spectator may be dazzled by the sun, and be unable to
distinguish the hawk from the heron. On the other hand, when the wind is
southerly, the heron flies towards the north, and it and the pursuing
hawk are clearly seen by the sportsman, who then has his back to the
sun, and without difficulty knows the hawk from the hernsew."

   *Jay*.—From its gay and gaudy plumage, this bird has been used for a
loose woman, as "Merry Wives of Windsor" (iii. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"We'll teach him to know turtles from jays,"</span>

</div>

*i.e.*, to distinguish honest women from loose ones. Again, in
"Cymbeline" (iii. 4), Imogen says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                             "Some jay of Italy  
Whose mother was her painting, <span id="fr_249"></span>[4](#fn_249)
hath betray’d him."</span>

</div>

   *Kestrel*.—A hawk <span id="fr_250"></span>[5](#fn_250) of a base
unserviceable breed, and therefore used by Spenser in his "Faerie Queen"
(II. iii. 4), to signify base

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Ne thought of honour ever did assay  
 His baser breast, but in his kestrell kynd  
 A pleasant veine of glory he did fynd."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> By some <span
id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_251) it is derived from "coystril," a knave
or peasant, from being the hawk formerly used by persons of inferior
rank. Thus, in "Twelfth Night" (i. 3), we find "coystrill," and in
"Pericles" (iv. 6), "coystrel." The name kestrel, says Singer, <span
id="fr_252"></span>[2](#fn_252) for an inferior kind of hawk, was
evidently a corruption of the French quercelle or quercerelle, and
originally had no connection with coystril, though in later times they
may have been confounded. Holinshed <span
id="fr_253"></span>[3](#fn_253) classes coisterels with lacqueys and
women, the unwarlike attendants on an army. The term was also given as a
nick-name to the emissaries employed by the kings of England in their
French wars. Dyce <span id="fr_254"></span>[4](#fn_254) also considers
kestrel distinct from coistrel.

   *Kingfisher*.—It was a common belief in days gone by, that during the
days the halcyon or kingfisher was engaged in hatching her eggs, the sea
remained so calm that the sailor might venture upon it without incurring
risk of storm or tempest; hence this period was called by Pliny and
Aristotle "the halcyon days," to which allusion is made in "1 Henry VI."
(i. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Expect St Martin's summer, halcyon days."</span>

</div>

Dryden also refers to this notion—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Amidst our arms as quiet you shall be,  
 As halcyons brooding on a winter's sea."</span>

</div>

Another superstition connected with this bird occurs in "King Lear" (ii.
1), where the Earl of Kent says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "Turn their halcyon beaks  
With every gale and vary of their masters."</span>

</div>

the prevalent idea being, that a dead kingfisher, suspended, from a
cord, would always turn its beak in that direction from whence the wind
blew. Marlow, in his "Jew of Malta," (i. 1), says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But now how stands the wind?  
 Into what corner peers my halcyon's bill?"</span>

</div>

   Occasionally one may still see this bird hung up in cottages, a
remnant, no doubt, of this old superstition. <span
id="fr_255"></span>[5](#fn_255)

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

   *Kite*.—This bird was considered by the ancients to be unlucky. In
"Julius Cæsar" (v. 1), Cassius says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "Ravens, crows, and kites,  
Fly o’er our heads and downward look on us."</span>

</div>

In "Cymbeline," too (i. 2), Imogen says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I chose an eagle, and did avoid a puttock,"</span>

</div>

puttock, <span id="fr_256"></span>[1](#fn_256) here, being a synonym
sometimes applied to the kite. Formerly the kite became a term of
reproach from its ignoble habits. Thus in "Antony and Cleopatra" (iii.
13), Antony exclaims, "You kite," and King Lear (i. 4), says to Goneril,
"detested kite, thou liest." Its intractable disposition is alluded to
in "Taming of the Shrew" by Petruchio (iv. 1). A curious peculiarity of
this bird is noticed in "Winter's Tale" (iv. 3), where Autolycus
says:—"My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser
linen"—meaning that his practice was to steal sheets; leaving the
smaller linen to be carried away by the kites, who will occasionally
carry it off to line their nests. <span id="fr_257"></span>[2](#fn_257)
Mr Dyce <span id="fr_258"></span>[3](#fn_258) quotes the following
remarks of Mr Peck on this passage—"Autolycus here gives us to
understand that he is a thief of the first class. This he explains by an
allusion to an odd vulgar notion. The common people many of them, think
that, if anyone can find a kite's nest, when she hath young, before they
are fledged, and sew up their back doors, so as they cannot mute, the
mother kite in compassion to their distress, will steal lesser linen, as
caps, cravats, ruffles, or any other such small matters as she can best
fly with, from off the hedges where they are hanged to dry after
washing, and carry them to her nest, and there leave them, if possible
to move the pity of the first corner, to cut the thread, and ease them
of their misery."

   *Lapwing*.—Several interesting allusions are made by Shakespeare to
this eccentric bird. It was a common notion that the young lapwings ran
out of the shell with part of it sticking on their heads, in such haste
were they to be hatched. Horatio ("Hamlet," v. 2) says of Osric—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This lapwing runs away with the shell on his
head."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

   It was, therefore, regarded as the symbol of a forward fellow.
Webster <span id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_259) in the "White Devil"
(1859, p. 13)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "Forward lapwing!  
He flies with the shell on’s head."</span>

</div>

   The lapwing, like the partridge, is also said to draw pursuers from
her nest by fluttering along the ground in an opposite direction or by
crying in other places. Thus in the "Comedy of Errors" (iv. 2),
Shakespeare says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Far from her nest the lapwing cries away."</span>

</div>

   Again in "Measure for Measure" (i. 4), Lucio exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "Though ’tis my familiar sin,  
With maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest  
Tongue far from heart."</span>

</div>

   Once more in "Much Ado about Nothing" (iii. 1) we read—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs,  
 Close by the ground, to hear our conference."</span>

</div>

   Several, too, of our older poets refer to this peculiarity. In Ben
Jonson's "Underwoods" (lviii.) we are told—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Where he that knows will like a lapwing fly,  
 Farre from the nest, and so himself belie."</span>

</div>

   Through thus alluring intruders from its nest, the lapwing became a
symbol of insincerity; and hence originated the proverb, "The lapwing
cries tongue from heart;" or, "The lapwing cries most, farthest from her
nest." <span id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_260)

   *Lark*.—Shakespeare has bequeathed to us many exquisite passages
referring to the lark, full of the most sublime pathos and lofty
conceptions. Most readers are doubtless acquainted with that superb song
in "Cymbeline" (ii. 3), where this sweet songster is represented as
singing "at heaven's gate;" and again, as the "bird of dawn," it is
described in "Venus and Adonis," thus—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest,  
 From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,  
 And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast  
 The sun ariseth in his majesty." <span
id="fr_261"></span>[3](#fn_261)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

   In "Love's Labour's Lost" (v. 2 song), we have a graphic touch of
pastoral life—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When shepherds pipe on oaten straws  
 And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks."</span>

</div>

The words of Portia, too, in "Merchant of Venice" (v. 1), to sing "as
sweetly as the lark," have long ago passed into a proverb.

   It was formerly a current saying that the lark and toad changed eyes,
to which Juliet refers in "Romeo and Juliet" (iii. 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Some say the lark and loathed toad change
eyes."</span>

</div>

Warburton says this popular fancy originated in the toad having very
fine eyes, and the lark very ugly ones. This tradition was formerly
expressed in a rustic rhyme—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "To heav’n I’d fly,  
But that the toad beguil’d me of mine eye."</span>

</div>

In "Henry VIII." (iii. 2), the Earl of Surrey, in denouncing Wolsey,
alludes to a curious method of capturing larks, which was effected by
small mirrors and red cloth. These scaring the birds made them crouch,
while the fowler drew his nets over them—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">           "Let his grace go forward,  
And dare us with his cap like larks."</span>

</div>

In this case the cap was the scarlet hat of the cardinal, which it was
intended to use as a piece of red cloth. The same idea occurs in
Skelton's "Why Come Ye not to Court?" a satire on Wolsey—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The red hat with his lure  
 Bringeth all things under cure."</span>

</div>

   The words "tirra-lyra" ("Winter's Tale," iv. 3), are a fanciful
combination of sounds, <span id="fr_262"></span>[1](#fn_262) meant to
imitate the lark's note, borrowed, says Nares, from the French
tire-lire. Browne, "British Pastorals" (bk. i. song 4), makes it
teery-leery. In

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

one of the Coventry pageants there is the following old song sung by the
shepherds at the birth of Christ, which contains the expression—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As I out rode this endenes night,  
 Of three joli shepherds I sawe a syght,  
 And all aboute there fold a stare shone bright,  
 They sang terli terlow,  
 So mereli the sheppards their pipes can blow."</span>

</div>

   In Scotland <span id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_263) and the north of
England, the peasantry say that if one is desirous of knowing what the
lark says, he must lie down on his back in the field and listen, and he
will then hear it say:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Up in the lift go we,  
 Tehee, tehee, tehee, tehee!  
 There's not a shoemaker on the earth  
 Can make a shoe to me, to me!  
 Why so, why so, why so?  
 Because my heel is as long as my toe."</span>

</div>

   *Magpie*.—It was formerly known as magot-pie, probably from the
French magot, a monkey, because the bird chatters and plays droll tricks
like a monkey. It has generally been regarded as a mysterious bird, and
regarded with superstitious awe, <span id="fr_264"></span>[2](#fn_264)
and is thus alluded to in "Macbeth," (iii. 4):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">  "Augurs and understood relations, have  
By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth  
The secret’st man of blood."</span>

</div>

   And again, in 3 "Henry VI.," (v. 6), it is said:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Chattering pies in dismal discords sung."</span>

</div>

   There are numerous rhymes <span id="fr_265"></span>[2](#fn_264)
relating to the magpie, of which we subjoin as a specimen one prevalent
in the north of England:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"One is sorrow, two mirth,  
 Three a wedding, four a birth.  
 Five heaven, six hell,  
 Seven the de’il's ain sell."</span>

</div>

   In Devonshire, in order to avert the ill-luck from seeing a magpie,
the peasant spits over his right shoulder three times,

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

and in Yorkshire various charms are in use. One is to raise the hat as a
salutation, and then to sign the cross on the breast; and another
consists in making the same sign by crossing the thumbs. It is a common
notion in Scotland that magpies flying near the windows of a house
portend a speedy death to one of its inmates. The superstitions
associated with the magpie are not confined to this country, for in
Sweden <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_265) it is considered the
witch's bird, belonging to the evil one and the other powers of night.
In Denmark, when a magpie perches on a house, it is regarded as a sign
that strangers are coming.

   *Martin*.—The martin, or martlet, which is called in "Macbeth," (i.
6), the "guest of summer," as being a migratory bird, has been from the
earliest times treated with superstitious respect,—it being considered
unlucky to molest or in any way injure its nest. Thus, in the "Merchant
of Venice," (ii. 9), the Prince of Arragon says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                  "The martlet  
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,  
Even in the force and road of casualty."</span>

</div>

   Forster <span id="fr_267"></span>[2](#fn_266) says that the
circumstance of this bird's nest being built so close to the habitations
of man indicates that it has long enjoyed freedom from molestation.
There is a popular rhyme still current in the north of England:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The martin and the swallow  
 Are God Almighty's bow and arrow."</span>

</div>

   *The Nightingale*.—The popular error that the nightingale sings with
its breast impaled upon a thorn is noticed by Shakespeare, who makes
Lucreece say:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And whiles against a thorn thou bear’st thy part,  
 To keep thy sharp woes waking."</span>

</div>

   In the "Passionate Pilgrim," (xxi.), there is an allusion:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Everything did banish moan,  
 Save the nightingale alone.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span>  She, poor bird, as all forlorn,  
 Lean’d her breast up-till a thorn,  
 And there sung the dolefull’st ditty,  
 That to hear it was great pity."</span>

</div>

   Beaumont and Fletcher, in "The Faithful Shepherdess" (v. 3), speak
of—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The nightingale among the thick-leaved spring,  
 That sits alone in sorrow, and doth sing  
 Whole nights away in mourning."</span>

</div>

   Sir Thomas Browne <span id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_267) asks "Whether
the nightingale's sitting with her breast against a thorn, be any more
than that she placeth some prickles on the outside of her nest, or
roosteth in thorny prickly places, where serpents may least approach
her." <span id="fr_269"></span>[2](#fn_268) In the "Zoologist" for 1862
the Rev. A. C. Smith mentions "the discovery, on two occasions, of a
strong thorn projecting upwards in the centre of the nightingale's
nest." Another notion is that the nightingale never sings by day; and
thus Portia in "Merchant of Venice," (v. 1), says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                "I think,  
The nightingale, if she could sing by day,  
When every goose is cackling, would be thought  
No better a musician than the wren."</span>

</div>

Such, however, is not the case, for this bird often sings as sweetly in
the day as at night-time. There is an old superstition <span
id="fr_270"></span>[3](#fn_269) that the nightingale sings all night, to
keep itself awake, lest the glow-worm should devour her. The classical
fable <span id="fr_271"></span>[4](#fn_270) of the unhappy Philomela
turned into a nightingale, when her sister Progne was changed to a
swallow, has doubtless given rise to this bird being spoken of as she;
thus Juliet tells Romeo (iii. 5),—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"It was the nightingale, and not the lark,  
 That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;  
 Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree;  
 Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sometimes the
nightingale is termed Philomel, as in "Midsummer Night's Dream" (ii. 2,
song) <span id="fr_272"></span>[1](#fn_271)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Philomel, with melody,  
 Sing your sweet lullaby."</span>

</div>

   *Osprey*.—This bird, <span id="fr_273"></span>[2](#fn_272) also
called the sea-eagle, besides having a destructive power of devouring
fish, was supposed formerly to have a fascinating influence, both which
qualities are alluded to in the following passage in "Coriolanus" (iv.
7)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "I think he'll be to Rome,  
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it  
By sovereignty of nature."</span>

</div>

Drayton, in his "Polyolbion" (Song xxv.), mentions the same fascinating
power of the osprey—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The osprey, oft here seen, though seldom here it
breeds,  
 Which over them the fish no sooner do espy,  
 But, betwixt him and them by an antipathy,  
 Turning their bellies up, as though their death they saw,  
 They at his pleasure lie, to stuff his gluttonous maw."</span>

</div>

   *Ostrich*.—The extraordinary digestion of this bird <span
id="fr_274"></span>[3](#fn_273) is said to be shown by its swallowing
iron and other hard substances. <span id="fr_275"></span>[4](#fn_274) In
2 Henry VI. (iv. 10), the rebel Cade says to Alexander Iden—"Ah villain,
thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand crowns of the .king by carrying
my head to him; but I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow
my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part." Cuvier, <span
id="fr_276"></span>[5](#fn_275) speaking of this bird, says, "It is yet
so voracious, and its senses of taste and smell are so obtuse, that it
devours animal and mineral substances indiscriminately, until its
enormous stomach is completely full. It swallows without any choice, and
merely as it were to serve for ballast, wood, stones, grass, iron,
copper, gold, lime, or, in fact, any other substance equally hard,
indigestible,

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

and deleterious." Sir Thomas Browne, <span
id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_276) writing on this subject, says, "The
ground of this conceit in its swallowing down fragments of iron, which
men observing, by a forward illation, have therefore conceived it
digesteth them, which is an inference, not to be admitted, as being a
fallacy of the consequent." In Loudon's "Magazine of Natural History"
(No. 6, p. 32), we are told of an ostrich having been killed by
swallowing glass.

   *Owl*.—The dread attached to this unfortunate bird is frequently
spoken of by Shakespeare, who has alluded to several of the
superstitions associated with it. At the outset, many of the epithets
ascribed to it show the prejudice with which it was regarded—being in
various places stigmatised as "the vile owl," in "Troilus and Cressida"
(ii. 1); and the "obscure bird," in "Macbeth" (ii. 3), etc. From the
earliest period it has been considered a bird of ill-omen, and Pliny
tells us how, on one occasion, even Rome itself underwent a lustration,
because one of them strayed into the Capitol. He represents it also as a
funereal bird, a monster of the night, the very abomination of human
kind. Virgil <span id="fr_278"></span>[2](#fn_277) describes its
death-howl from the top of the temple by night, a circumstance
introduced as a precursor of Dido's death. Ovid, <span
id="fr_279"></span>[3](#fn_278) too, constantly speaks of this bird's
presence as an evil omen; and indeed the same notions respecting it may
be found among the writings of most of the ancient poets. This
superstitious awe in which the owl is held may be owing to its peculiar
look, its occasional and uncertain appearance, its loud and dismal
cry, <span id="fr_280"></span>[4](#fn_279) as well as to its being the
bird of night. <span id="fr_281"></span>[5](#fn_280) It has generally
been associated with calamities and deeds of darkness. <span
id="fr_282"></span>[6](#fn_281) Thus its weird shriek pierces the ear of
Lady Macbeth (ii. 2), while the murder is being committed—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                         "Hark!—Peace!  
It was the owl that shriek’d, the fatal bellman,  
Which gives the stern’st good night."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And when the
murderer rushes in exclaiming—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a
noise?"</span>

</div>

She answers—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I heard the owl scream."</span>

</div>

Its appearance at a birth has been said to foretell ill-luck to the
infant, a superstition to which King Henry, in "3 Henry VI." (v. 6),
addressing Gloucester, refers—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The owl shriek’d at thy birth, an evil
sign."</span>

</div>

Its cries <span id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_282) have been supposed to
presage death, and, to quote the words of the "Spectator," "a
screech-owl at mid: night has alarmed a family more than a band of
robbers." Thus, in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (v. 1), we are told how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The screech-owl, screeching loud,  
 Puts the wretch that lies in woe  
 In remembrance of a shroud";</span>

</div>

and, in "1 Henry VI." (iv. 2), it is called the "ominous and fearful
hour of death." Again, when Richard III. (iv. 4) is exasperated by the
bad news, he interrupts the third messenger by saying—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of
death?"</span>

</div>

The owl by day is considered by some equally ominous, as in "3 Henry
VI." (v. 4) <span id="fr_284"></span>[1](#fn_282)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "The owl by day,  
If he arise, is mock’d and wonder’d at."</span>

</div>

   And in "Julius Cæsar" (i. 3), Casca says,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And yesterday the bird of night did sit  
 Even at noon-day, upon the market-place,  
 Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies  
 Do so conjointly meet, let not men say,  
 These are their reasons,—they are natural';  
 For, I believe they are portentous things  
 Unto the climate that they point upon."</span>

</div>

Considering, however, the abhorrence with which the owl is generally
regarded, it is not surprising that the "owlet's wing" <span
id="fr_285"></span>[2](#fn_283)

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

should form an ingredient of the cauldron in which the witches in
"Macbeth" (iv. 1), prepared their "charm of powerful trouble." The owl
is, too, in all probability, represented by Shakespeare as a
witch, <span id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_284) a companion of the fairies
in their moonlight gambols. In "Comedy of Errors" (ii. 2), Dromio of
Syracuse says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This is the fairy land: O, spite of spites!  
 We talk with goblins, owls, and elvish sprites.  
 If we obey them not, this will ensue,  
 They'll suck our breath, and pinch us black and blue!"</span>

</div>

Singer in his Notes on this passage (ii. p. 28) says—"It has been asked,
how should Shakespeare know that screech-owls were considered by the
Romans as witches?" Do these cavillers think that Shakespeare never
looked into a book? Take an extract from the Cambridge Latin Dictionary
(1594, 8vo), probably the very book he used: "Strix, a *scritche owle;*
an unluckie kind of bird (as they of olde time said) which sucked out
the blood of infants lying in their cradles; a witch, that changeth the
favour of children; an hagge or fairie." So in the "London Prodigal," a
comedy, 1605:—"Soul, I think I am sure crossed or witch’d with an
owl." <span id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_285) In the "Tempest" (v. 1),
Shakespeare introduces Ariel as saying—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Where the bee sucks, there suck I,  
 In a cowslip's bell I lie,  
 There I couch when owls do cry."</span>

</div>

Ariel, <span id="fr_288"></span>[3](#fn_286) who sucks honey for luxury
in the cowslip's bell, retreats thither for quiet when owls are abroad
and screeching. According to an old legend, the owl was originally a
baker's daughter, to which allusion is made in "Hamlet" (iv. 5), where
Ophelia exclaims—"They say the owl was a baker's daughter. Lord, we know
what we are, but know not what we may be." Douce <span
id="fr_289"></span>[4](#fn_287) says the following story was current
among the Gloucestershire peasantry:—"Our Saviour went into a baker's
shop where they were baking, and asked for some

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

bread to eat; the mistress of the shop immediately put a piece of dough
into the oven to bake for him; but was reprimanded by her daughter, who,
insisting that the piece of dough was too large, reduced it to a very
small size; the dough, however, immediately began to swell, and
presently became a most enormous size, whereupon the baker's daughter
cried out, 'Heugh, heugh, heugh!' which owl-like noise probably induced
our Saviour to transform her into that bird for her wickedness." Another
version of the same story, as formerly known in Herefordshire,
substitutes a fairy in the place of our Saviour. Similar legends are
found on the Continent. <span id="fr_290"></span>[1](#fn_288)

   *Parrot*.—The "popinjay," in "1 Henry IV." (i. 3), is another name
for the parrot—from the Spanish, papagayo—a term which occurs in
Browne's "Pastorals" (ii. 65)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Or like the mixture nature dothe display  
 Upon the quaint wings of the popinjay."</span>

</div>

   Its supposed restlessness before rain is referred to in "As you like
it," (iv. 1):—"More clamorous than a parrot against rain." It was
formerly customary to teach the parrot unlucky words, with which when
anyone was offended, it was the standing joke of the wise owner to say,
"Take heed, sir, my parrot prophesies,"—an allusion to which custom we
find in "Comedy of Errors," (iv. 4), where Dromio of Ephesus
says:—"Prophesy like the parrot, *beware the rope's end*." To this
Butler hints, where speaking of Ralpho's skill in augury, he says <span
id="fr_291"></span>[2](#fn_289):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Could tell what subtlest parrots mean,  
 That speak and think contrary clean;  
 What member ’tis of whom they talk,  
 When they cry *rope*, and *walk, knave walk*."</span>

</div>

   The rewards given to parrots to encourage them to speak are mentioned
in "Troilus and Cressida," (v. 2) <span
id="fr_292"></span>[3](#fn_290)—"The parrot will not do more for an
almond." Hence, a proverb for the greatest temptation that could be put
before a man

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

seems to have been "An almond for a parrot." To "talk like a parrot," is
a common proverb, a sense in which it occurs in "Othello," (ii. 3).

   *Peacock*.—This bird was as proverbially used for a proud, vain fool
as the lapwing for a silly one. In this sense some would understand it
in the much disputed passage in "Hamlet," (iii. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For thou dost know, O Damon dear,  
   This realm dismantled was  
 Of Jove himself; and now reigns here  
   A very, very—peacock." <span id="fr_293"></span>[1](#fn_291)</span>

</div>

   The third and fourth folios reads *pajock*, <span
id="fr_294"></span>[2](#fn_292) the other editions have "paiock,"
"paiocke," or "pajocke," and in the later quartos the word was changed
to "paicock" and "pecock," whence Pope printed peacock.

   Dyce says that in Scotland the peacock is called the pea-jock. Some
have proposed to read paddock, and in the last scene Hamlet bestows this
opprobrious name upon the king. It has been also suggested to read
puttock, a kite. <span id="fr_295"></span>[3](#fn_293) The peacock has
also been regarded as the emblem of pride and arrogance, as in 1 "Henry
VI." (iii. 3) <span id="fr_296"></span>[4](#fn_294):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while,  
 And, like a peacock, sweep along his tail;  
 We'll pull his plumes and take away his train."</span>

</div>

   *Pelican*.—There are several allusions by Shakespeare to the
pelican's piercing her own breast to feed her young. Thus, in Hamlet
(iv. 5), Laertes says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;  
 And like the kind life-rendering pelican,  
 Repast them with my blood."</span>

</div>

   And in "King Lear," where the young pelicans are represented

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

as piercing their mother's breast to drink her blood, an illustration of
filial impiety (iii. 4), the king says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers  
 Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?  
 Judicious punishment! ’Twas this flesh begot  
 Those pelican daughters." <span id="fr_297"></span>[1](#fn_295)</span>

</div>

   It is a common notion that the fable here alluded to is a classical
one, but this is an error. Shakespeare, says Mr Harting, "was content to
accept the story as he found it, and to apply it metaphorically as the
occasion required." Mr Houghton, in an interesting letter to "Land and
Water " <span id="fr_298"></span>[2](#fn_296) on this subject, remarks
that the Egyptians believed in a bird feeding its young with its blood,
and this bird is none other than the vulture. He goes on to say that the
fable of the pelican doubtless originated in the Patristic annotations
on the scriptures. The ecclesiastical Fathers transferred the Egyptian
story from the vulture to the pelican, but magnified the story a
hundredfold, for the blood of the parent was not only supposed to serve
as food for the young, but was also able to reanimate the dead
offspring. Augustine, commenting on Psalm cii. 6,—"I am like a pelican
of the wilderness,"—remarks:—"These birds \[male pelicans\] are said to
kill their offspring by blows of their beaks, and then to bewail their
death for the space of three days. At length, however, it is said that
the mother inflicts a severe wound on herself, pouring the flowing blood
over the dead young ones, which instantly brings them to life." To the
same effect write Eustathius, Isidorus, Epiphanius, and a host of other
writers. <span id="fr_299"></span>[3](#fn_297)

   According to another idea <span id="fr_300"></span>[4](#fn_298)
pelicans are hatched dead, but the cock pelican then wounds his breast,
and lets one drop of blood fall upon each, and this quickens them.

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

   *Pheasant*.—This bird is only once alluded to in "Winter's Tale" (iv.
4), where the Clown jokingly says to the Shepherd—"Advocate's the Court
word for a pheasant; say you have none."

   *Phœnix*.—Many allusions are given to this fabulous bird which is
said to rise again from its own ashes. Thus in "Henry VIII." (v. 4),
Cranmer tells how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                "When  
The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phœnix,  
Her ashes new create another heir,  
As great in admiration as herself."</span>

</div>

Again, in "3 Henry VI." (i. 4), the Duke of York exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My ashes, as the phœnix, may bring forth  
 A bird that will revenge upon you all."</span>

</div>

Once more, in "Henry VI." (iv. 7), Sir William Lucy speaking of Talbot
and those slain with him, predicts that "from their ashes shall be
rear’d a phœnix that shall make all France afeard." <span
id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_299)

   Sir Thomas Browne <span id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_300) tells us that
there is but one phœnix in the world, "which after many hundred years
burns herself, and from the ashes thereof ariseth up another." From the
very earliest times there have been countless traditions respecting this
wonderful bird. Thus its longevity has been estimated from three hundred
to fifteen hundred years; and among the various localities assigned as
its home are Ethiopia, Arabia, Egypt, and India. In the "Phœnix and the
Turtle," it is said—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Let the bird of loudest lay  
 On the sole Arabian tree,  
 Herald sad and trumpet be."</span>

</div>

   Pliny says of this bird, "Howbeit, I cannot tell what to make of him;
and first of all, whether it be a tale or no, that there is never but
one of them in the whole world, and the same not commonly seen."
Malone <span id="fr_303"></span>[3](#fn_301) quotes from Lyly's "Euphues
and his England" (p. 312, ed. Arber). "For as

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

there is but one phœnix in the world, so is there but one tree in Arabia
wherein she buyldeth;" and Florio's "New Worlde of Wordes" (1598),
"Rasin, a tree in Arabia, whereof there is but one found, and upon it
the phœnix sits."

   *Pigeon*.—As carriers these birds have been used from a very early
date, and the castle of the birds at Bagdad takes its name from the
pigeon-post which the old monks of the convent established. The building
has crumbled into ruins long ago by the lapse of time, but the bird
messengers of Bagdad became celebrated as far westward as Greece, and
were a regular commercial institution between the distant parts of Asia
Minor, Arabia, and the east. <span id="fr_304"></span>[1](#fn_302) In
ancient Egypt also the carrier breed was brought to great perfection,
and, between the cities of the Nile and the Red Sea, the old traders
used to send word of their caravans to each other by letters written on
silk, and tied under the wings of trained doves. In "Titus Andronicus"
(iv. 3), Titus, on seeing a clown enter with two pigeons, says—"News,
news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come. Sirrah, What tidings? have
you any letters?" From the same play we also learn that it was also
customary to give a pair of pigeons as a present. The Clown says to
Saturninus (iv. 4), "I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons
here." <span id="fr_305"></span>[2](#fn_303)

In "Romeo and Juliet" (i. 3), the dove is used synonymously for pigeon;
where the nurse is represented as "sitting in the sun under the
dove-house wall." <span id="fr_306"></span>[3](#fn_304)\* Mr Darwin in
his "Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication" (i. pp. 204,
205), has shown that from the very earliest times pigeons have been kept
in a domesticated state. He says—"The earliest record of pigeons in a
domesticated condition occurs in the 5th Egyptian dynasty, about 3000
B.C., but Mr Birch of the British Museum informs me that the pigeon
appears in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty. Domestic pigeons are
mentioned in "Genesis," "Leviticus," and "Isaiah." Pliny informs us that
the Romans gave immense prices for pigeons; 'nay, they are come to this
pass, that they can

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

reckon up their pedigree and race.' In India, about the year 1600
pigeons were much valued by Akber Khan; 20,000 birds were carried about
with the Court." In most countries, too, the breeding and taming of
pigeons have been a favourite recreation. The constancy of the pigeon
has been proverbial from time immemorial; allusions to which occur in
"Winter's Tale" (iv. 3); and in "As You Like it" (iii. 3).

   *Quail*.—The quail was thought to be an amorous bird; and hence was
metaphorically used to denote people of a loose character. <span
id="fr_307"></span>[1](#fn_305) In this sense it is generally understood
in "Troilus and Cressida" (v. 1), "Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow
enough, and one that loves quails." Mr Harting, <span
id="fr_308"></span>[2](#fn_306) however, thinks that the passage just
quoted refers to the practice formerly prevalent of keeping quails, and
making them fight like game-cocks. The context of the passage would seem
to sanction the former meaning. Quail fighting <span
id="fr_309"></span>[3](#fn_307) is spoken of in "Antony and Cleopatra"
(ii. 3), where Antony, speaking of the superiority of Cæsar's fortunes
to his own, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">              "If we draw lots, he speeds;  
His cocks do win the battle still of mine,  
When it is all to nought; and his quails ever  
Beat mine, inhoop’d, at odds."</span>

</div>

   It appears that cocks as well as quails were sometimes made to fight
within a broad hoop—hence the term inhoop’d—to keep them from quitting
each other. Quail-fights were well known among the ancients, and
especially at Athens. <span id="fr_310"></span>[4](#fn_308) Julius
Pollux relates that a circle was made, in which the birds were placed,
and he whose quail was driven out of this circle lost the stake, which
was sometimes money, and occasionally the quails themselves. Another
practice was to produce one of these birds, which being first smitten
with the middle finger, a feather was then plucked from its head. If the
quail bore this operation without flinching, his master

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

gained the stake, but lost it if he ran away. Some doubt exists as to
whether quail-fighting prevailed in the time of Shakespeare. At the
present day <span id="fr_311"></span>[1](#fn_309) the Sumatrans practise
these quail combats, and this pastime is common in some parts of Italy,
and also in China. Mr Douce has given a curious print, from an elegant
Chinese miniature painting, which represents some ladies engaged at this
amusement, where the quails are actually inhooped.

   *Raven*.—Perhaps no bird is so universally unpopular as the raven,
its hoarse croak in most countries being regarded as ominous. Hence, as
might be expected, Shakespeare often refers to it, in order to make the
scene he depicts all the more vivid and graphic. In "Titus Andronicus"
(ii. 3), Tamora, describing "a barren detested vale," says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,  
 O’ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:  
 Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,  
 Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven."</span>

</div>

And in "Julius Cæsar" (v. 1), Cassius tells us how ravens

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Fly o’er our heads and downward look on us,  
 As we were sickly prey." <span id="fr_312"></span>[2](#fn_310)</span>

</div>

   It seems that the superstitious dread <span
id="fr_313"></span>[3](#fn_311) attaching to this bird has chiefly
arisen from its supposed longevity, <span
id="fr_314"></span>[4](#fn_312) and its frequent mention and agency in
Holy Writ. By the Romans it was consecrated to Apollo, and was believed
to have a prophetic knowledge—a notion still very prevalent. Thus its
supposed faculty <span id="fr_315"></span>[5](#fn_313) of "smelling
death" still renders its presence, or even its voice, ominous. Othello
(iv. i) exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">           "O, it comes o’er my memory,  
As doth the raven o’er the infected house,  
Boding to all."</span>

</div>

There is no doubt a reference here to the fanciful notion that it was a
constant attendant on a house infected with the plague. Most readers,
too, are familiar with that famous

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

passage in "Macbeth" (i. 5), where Lady Macbeth, having heard of the
king's intention to stay at the castle, exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">           "The raven himself is hoarse  
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan  
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits  
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,  
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full  
Of direst cruelty!"</span>

</div>

   We may compare Spenser's language in the "Faerie Queene" (bk. ii., c.
vii. 23)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"After him owles and night ravens flew,  
 The hateful messengers of heavy things,  
 Of death and dolor telling sad tidings."</span>

</div>

And once more the following passage from Drayton's "Barons’ Wars" (book
v. st. 42), illustrates the same idea—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The ominous raven often he doth hear,  
 Whose croaking him of following horror tells."</span>

</div>

   In "Much Ado About Nothing" (ii. 3), the "night-raven" is mentioned.
Benedick observes to himself—"I had as lief have heard the night-raven,
come what plague could have come after it." <span
id="fr_316"></span>[1](#fn_314)\* This inauspicious bird, according to
Steevens, is the owl; but this conjecture is evidently wrong,
"being <span id="fr_317"></span>[2](#fn_315) at variance with sundry
passages in our early writers, who make a distinction between it and the
night-raven."

   Thus Johnson, in his "Seven Champions of Christendom" (part i),
speaks of "the dismal cry of night-ravens, . . . . and the fearefull
sound of schriek owles." Cotgrave regarded the "night-crow" and the
"night-raven" as synonymous; and Mr Yarrell considered them only
different names for the night-heron. <span
id="fr_318"></span>[3](#fn_316) In "3 Henry VI." (v. 6), King Henry
says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The night-crow cried, aboding luckless
time."</span>

</div>

Goldsmith, in his "Animated Nature," calls the bittern the night-raven,
and says—"I remember, in the place where I

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

was a boy, with what terror the bird's note affected the whole village;
they consider it as the presage of some sad event, and generally found,
or made one to succeed it. If any person in the neighbourhood died, they
supposed it could not be otherwise, for the night-raven had foretold it;
but if nobody happened to die, the death of a cow or a sheep gave
completion to the prophecy."

   According to an old belief, the raven deserts its own young, to which
Shakespeare alludes in "Titus Andronicus" (ii. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,  
 The whilst their own birds famish in their nests."</span>

</div>

"It was supposed that when the raven," says Mr Harting, <span
id="fr_319"></span>[1](#fn_317) "saw its young ones newly hatched, and
covered with down, it conceived such an aversion that it forsook them,
and did not return to the nest until a darker plumage had shown itself."
To this belief the commentators consider the Psalmist refers, when he
says—"He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which
cry" (Psalm cxlvii. 9). We are told, too, in Job, "Who provideth for the
raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack
of meat" (Job xxxviii. 41). Shakespeare, in "As You Like It" (ii. 3),
probably had the words of the Psalmist in his mind—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">      "He that doth the ravens feed  
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow."</span>

</div>

   The raven has from earliest times been symbolical of blackness, both
in connection with colour and character. In "Romeo and Juliet" (iii. 2),
Juliet exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face,  
 Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?  
 Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!  
 Dove-feather’d raven!" <span id="fr_320"></span>[2](#fn_318)</span>

</div>

Once more, ravens’ feathers were formerly used by witches, from an old
superstition that the wings of this bird carried

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

with them contagion wherever they went. Hence in the "Tempest" (i. 2),
Caliban says

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As wicked dew as e’er my mother brush’d  
 With raven's feather from unwholesome fen  
 Drop on you both."</span>

</div>

   *Robin Redbreast*.—According to a pretty notion, <span
id="fr_321"></span>[1](#fn_319) this little bird is said to cover with
leaves any dead body it may chance to find unburied; a belief which
probably in a great measure originated in the well-known ballad of the
"Children in the Wood," although it seems to have been known previously.
Thus Singer quotes as follows from "Cornucopia, or Divers Secrets," &c.
(by Thomas Johnson, 1596)—"The robin redbreast, if he finds a man or
woman dead, will cover all his face with moss; and some think that if
the body should remain unburied that he would cover the whole body
also." In Dekker's "Villaines Discovered by Lanthorn and Candlelight"
(1616), quoted by Douce, it is said—"They that cheere up a prisoner but
with their sight, are robin redbreasts that bring strawes in their bills
to cover a dead man in extremitie." Shakespeare, in a beautiful passage
in "Cymbeline" (iv. 2), thus touchingly alludes to it, making Arviragus,
when addressing the supposed dead body of Imogen, say—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                          "With fairest flowers  
While summer lasts, and I live here, Fidele,  
I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack  
The flower that like's thy face, pale primrose, nor  
The azured harebell, like thy veins; no, nor  
The leaf of Eglantine, whom not to slander  
Out-sweeten’d not thy breath: the ruddock would,  
With charitable bill,—o bill, sore shaming  
Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie  
Without a monument! bring thee all this;  
Yea, and furr’d moss besides, when flowers are none,  
To winter-ground thy corse."</span>

</div>

the "ruddock" <span id="fr_322"></span>[2](#fn_320) being one of the old
names for the redbreast,

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

which is now-a-days found in some localities. John Webster, also, refers
to the same idea in "The White Devil" (1857. Edit. Dyce, p. 45),—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Call for the robin redbreast and the wren,  
   Since o’er shady groves they hover,  
   And with leaves and flowers do cover  
 The friendless bodies of unburied men."</span>

</div>

   Drayton, too, in the "Owl," has the following lines:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Cov’ring with moss the dead's unclosed eye,  
 The little redbreast teaching charitie."</span>

</div>

   *Rook*.—As an ominous bird this is mentioned in "Macbeth," (iii. 4).
Formerly the nobles of England prided themselves in having a
rookery <span id="fr_323"></span>[1](#fn_321) in the neighbourhood of
their castles, because rooks were regarded as "fowls of good omen." On
this account no one was permitted to kill them, under severe penalties.
When rooks desert a rookery <span id="fr_324"></span>[2](#fn_322) it is
said to foretell the downfall of the family on whose property it is. A
Northumbrian saying informs us that the rooks left the rookery of
Chipchase before the family of Reed left that place. There is also a
notion that when rooks haunt a town or village "mortality is supposed to
await its inhabitants, and if they feed in the street it shows that a
storm is at hand." <span id="fr_325"></span>[3](#fn_323)

   The expression "bully-rook," in "Merry Wives of Windsor," (I. 3), in
Shakespeare's time, says Mr Harting, <span
id="fr_326"></span>[4](#fn_324) had the same meaning as "jolly-dog"
now-a-days; but subsequently it became a term of reproach, meaning a
cheating sharper. It has been suggested that the term derives its origin
from the rook in the game of chess; but Douce <span
id="fr_327"></span>[5](#fn_325) considers it very improbable that this
noble game, "never the amusement of gamblers, should have been ransacked
on this occasion."

   *Snipe*.—This bird was in Shakespeare's time proverbial for

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

a foolish man. <span id="fr_328"></span>[1](#fn_326) In "Othello," (1.
3), Iago, speaking of Roderigo, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For I mine own gain’d knowledge should profane,  
 If I would time expend with such a snipe,  
 But for my sport and profit."</span>

</div>

   *Sparrow*.—A popular name for the common sparrow was, and still is,
philip, perhaps from its note, "Phip, phip." Hence the allusion to a
person named Philip in "King John," (i. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">*Gurney*, Good leave, good Philip.  
*Bastard*, Philip!—sparrow.</span>

</div>

   Staunton says perhaps Catullus alludes to this expression in the
following lines:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sed circumsiliens, modo huc, modo illuc,  
 Ad solam dominam usque pipilabat."</span>

</div>

   Skelton, in an elegy upon a sparrow, calls it "Phyllyp Sparowe"; and
Gascoigne also writes "The praise of Philip Sparrow."

   In "Measure for Measure," (iii. 2), Lucio, speaking of Angelo, the
Deputy-Duke of Vienna, says:—"Sparrows must not build in his
house-eaves, because they are lecherous." <span
id="fr_329"></span>[2](#fn_327)

   *Sparrow-hawk*.—A name formerly given to a young sparrow hawk was
eyas-musket, <span id="fr_330"></span>[3](#fn_328) a term we find in
"Merry Wives of Windsor," (iii. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"How now, my-eyas-musket!  
 What news with you?"</span>

</div>

   It was thus metaphorically used as a jocular phrase for a small
child. As the invention, too, of fire-arms took place <span
id="fr_331"></span>[4](#fn_329) at a time when hawking was in high
fashion, some of the new weapons were named after those birds, probably
from

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

the idea of their fetching their prey from on high. Musket has thus
become the established name for one sort of gun. Some, however, assert
that the musket was invented in the fifteenth century, and owes its name
to its inventors.

   *Starling*.—This was one of the birds that was in days gone by
trained to speak. In "1 Henry IV." (i. 3), Hotspur says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak  
 Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him,  
 To keep his anger still in motion."</span>

</div>

   Pliny tells us how starlings were taught to utter both Latin and
Greek words for the amusement of the young Cæsars; and there are
numerous instances on record of the clever sentences uttered by this
amusing bird.

   *Swallow*.—This bird has generally been honoured as the harbinger of
spring, and Athenæus relates that the Rhodians had a solemn song to
welcome it. Anacreon has a well known ode. Shakespeare in the "Winter's
Tale" (iv. 3), alludes to the time of the swallow's appearance in the
following passage—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                           "Daffodils,  
That come before the swallow dares, and take  
The winds of March with beauty."</span>

</div>

And its departure is mentioned in "Timon of Athens" (iii. 6), "The
swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship."

   We may compare Tennyson's notice of the bird's approach and migration
in the "May Queen"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And the swallow ’ll come back again with summer
o’er the wave."</span>

</div>

   It has been long considered lucky for the swallow to build its nest
on the roof of a house, but just as unlucky for it to forsake a place
which it has once tenanted. Shakespeare probably had this superstition
in his mind when he represents Scarus as saying, in "Antony and
Cleopatra" (iv. 12)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                      "Swallows have built  
In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers  
Say they know not,—they cannot tell;—look grimly,  
And dare not speak their knowledge."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

   *Swan*.—According to a romantic notion, dating from antiquity, the
swan is said to sing sweetly just before its death, many pretty
allusions to which we find scattered here and there throughout
Shakespeare's plays. In "Merchant of Venice" (iii. 2), Portia says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">               "He makes a swan-like end,  
Fading in music."</span>

</div>

Emilia, too, in "Othello" (v. 2), just before she dies, exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "I will play the swan,  
And die in music."</span>

</div>

In "King John" (v. 7), Prince Henry, at his father's deathbed, thus
pathetically speaks—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"’Tis strange that death should sing.  
 I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,  
 Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,  
 And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings  
 His soul and body to their lasting rest."</span>

</div>

Again, in "Lucrece" (1611), we have these touching lines—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And now this pale swan in her watery nest,  
 Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending."</span>

</div>

And once more in "Phœnix and the Turtle"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Let the priest in surplice white,  
 That defunctive music can,  
 Be the death-divining swan,  
 Lest the requiem lack his right."</span>

</div>

   This superstition, says Douce, <span id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_330)
"was credited by Plato, Chrysippus, Aristotle, Euripides, Philostratus,
Cicero, Seneca, and Martial. Pliny, Ælian, and Athenæus, among the
ancients, and Sir Thomas More, among the moderns, treat this opinion as
a vulgar error. Luther believed in it." This notion probably originated
in the swan being identified with Orpheus. Sir Thomas Browne <span
id="fr_333"></span>[2](#fn_331) says we read that, "after his death
Orpheus the musician became a swan. Thus was it the bird of Apollo, the
bird of music by the Greeks." Alluding

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

to this piece of folk-lore, Carl Engel <span
id="fr_334"></span>[1](#fn_332) remarks:—"Although our common swan does
not produce sounds which might account for this tradition, it is a
well-known fact that the wild swan (*Cygnus ferus*), also called the
'whistling swan,' when on the wing emits a shrill tone, which, however
harsh it may sound if heard near, produces a pleasant effect when,
emanating from a large flock high in the air, it is heard in a variety
of pitches of sound, increasing or diminishing in loudness according to
the movement of the birds and to the current of the air." Colonel
Hawker <span id="fr_335"></span>[2](#fn_333) says, "The only note which
I ever heard the wild swan make, in winter, is his well-known
'whoop.'" <span id="fr_336"></span>[3](#fn_334)

   *Tassel-Gentle*. <span id="fr_337"></span>[4](#fn_335)—The male of
the Goshawk was so called on account of its tractable disposition, and
the facility with which it was tamed. It occurs in "Romeo and Juliet"
(ii. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O, for a falconer's voice  
 To lure this tassel-gentle back again!"</span>

</div>

Spenser, in his "Faerie Queene" (Bk. iii., iv. 49), says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Having far off espied a tassel-gent  
 Which after her his nimble wings doth straine."</span>

</div>

This species of hawk was also commonly called a "falcon-gentle;" on
account of "her familiar, courteous, disposition." <span
id="fr_338"></span>[5](#fn_336)

   *Turkey*.—This bird, so popular with us at Christmas-tide, is
mentioned in "1 Henry IV." (ii. 1), where the First Carrier says:—"God's
body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite starved." This however, is an
anachronism on the part of Shakespeare, as the turkey was unknown in
this country until the reign of Henry VIII. According to a rhyme written
in 1525, commemorating the introduction of this bird, we are told how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Turkies, carps, hoppes, piccarell, and beere,  
 Came into England all in one yeare."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The turkey is
again mentioned by Shakespeare in 'Twelfth Night' (ii. 5), where Fabian
says of Malvolio:—"Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him: how he
jets under his advanced plumes."

   *Vulture*.—In several passages Shakespeare has introduced most
forcibly this bird to deepen the beauty of some of his exquisite
passages. Thus King Lear (ii. 4), when complaining of the unkindness of
a daughter, bitterly exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "O Regan, she hath tied  
Sharp-tooth’d unkindness, like a vulture, here."</span>

</div>

What, too, can be more graphic than the expression of Tamora in "Titus
Andronicus" (v. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am Revenge, sent from the infernal kingdom,  
 To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind."</span>

</div>

Equally forcible too are Pistol's words in "The Merry Wives of Windsor"
(i. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Let vultures gripe thy guts."</span>

</div>

   Johnson considers that "the vulture of sedition" in "2 Henry VI."
(iv. 3), is in allusion to the tale of Prometheus, but of this there is
a decided uncertainty.

   *Wagtail*.—In "King Lear" (ii. 2), Kent says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Spare my grey beard, you wagtail,"</span>

</div>

the word being used, in an opprobrious sense, to signify an officious
person.

   *Woodcock*.—In several passages this bird is used to denote a fool or
silly person; as in "Taming of the Shrew" (i. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O this woodcock! what an ass it is!"</span>

</div>

And again in "Much ado about Nothing" (v. 1) where Claudio, alluding to
the plot against Benedick, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Shall I not find a woodcock too."</span>

</div>

In "Love's Labour's Lost" (iv. 3) Biron says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "O heavens, I have my wish;  
Duncan's transformed: four woodcocks in a dish."</span>

</div>

   The woodcock has generally been proverbial as a foolish bird,—perhaps
because it is easily caught in springes or

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

nets. <span id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_337) Thus the popular phrase
"Springes to catch woodcocks "meant arts to entrap simplicity, <span
id="fr_340"></span>[2](#fn_338) as in "Hamlet" (i. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Aye, springes to catch woodcocks."</span>

</div>

A similar expression occurs in Beaumont and Fletcher's "Loyal Subject"
(iv. 4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">            "Go like a woodcock,  
And thrust your neck i’ th’ noose."</span>

</div>

   "It seems," says Nares, "that woodcocks are now grown wiser by time,
for we do not now hear of their being so easily caught. If they were
sometimes said to be without brains, it was only founded on their
character, certainly not on any examination of the fact." <span
id="fr_341"></span>[3](#fn_339) Formerly, one of the terms for
twilight <span id="fr_342"></span>[4](#fn_340) was "cock-shut time,"
because the net in which cocks, *i.e.* woodcocks, were shut in during
the twilight, was called a "cock-shut." It appears that a large net was
stretched across a glade, and so suspended upon poles as to be easily
drawn together. Thus in "Richard III." (v. 3) Ratcliff says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,  
 Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop,  
 Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers."</span>

</div>

   In Ben Jonson's "Masque of Gypsies" we read—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Mistress, this is only spite;  
 For you would not yesternight  
 Kiss him in the cock-shut light."</span>

</div>

Sometimes it was erroneously written "cock-shoot." "Come, come away
then, a fine cock-shoot evening." In the "Two Noble Kinsmen" (iv. i) we
find the term "cock-light."

   *Wren*.—The diminutive character of this bird is noticed in "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" (iii. 1, song)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The wren with little quill."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

   Lady Macbeth (iv. 2) says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "The poor wren,  
The most diminutive of birds, will fight  
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl."</span>

</div>

   Considering, too, that as many as sixteen young ones have been found
in this little bird's nest, we can say with Grahame in his poem on the
birds of Scotland—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But now behold the greatest of this train  
 Of miracles, stupendously minute;  
 The numerous progeny, claimant for food  
 Supplied by two small bills, and feeble wings  
 Of narrow range, supplied—ay, duly fed—  
 Fed in the dark, and yet not one forgot."</span>

</div>

   The epithet "poor" applied to the wren by Lady Macbeth was certainly
appropriate in days gone by, when we recollect how it was cruelly hunted
in Ireland on St Stephen's day—a practice which prevailed also in the
Isle of Man. <span id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_341)
