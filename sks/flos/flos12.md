### CHAPTER X.

#### FOLK MEDICINE.

<span class="smallcaps">Without</span> discussing the extent of
Shakespeare's technical medical knowledge, the following pages will
suffice to show that he was fully acquainted with many of the popular
notions prevalent in his day, respecting certain diseases and their
cures. These, no doubt, he collected partly from the literature of the
period with which he was so fully conversant, besides gathering a good
deal of information on the subject from daily observation. Anyhow, he
has bequeathed to us some interesting particulars relating to the
folk-medicine of bygone times, which is of value, in so far as it helps
to illustrate the history of medicine in past years. In Shakespeare's
day the condition of medical science was very unlike that at the present
day. As Mr Goadby, in his "England of Shakespeare" (1881, p. 104),
remarks, "the man of science was always more or less of an alchemist,
and the students of medicine were usually extensive dealers in charms
and philtres "If a man wanted bleeding he went to a barber-surgeon, and
when he required medicine he consulted an apothecary; the shop of the
latter being well described by Romeo (v. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,  
 An alligator stuff’d, and other skins  
 Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves  
 A beggarly account of empty boxes,  
 Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,  
 Remnants of pack-thread and old cakes of roses,  
 Were thinly scattered to make up a show."</span>

</div>

Such a man was as ready "to sell love philtres to a maiden as narcotics
to a friar."

   *Bleeding*.—Various remedies were in use in Shakespeare's

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

day to stop bleeding. Thus, a key, on account of the coldness of the
metal of which it is composed, was often employed; hence the term "key
cold" became proverbial, and is referred to by many old writers. In
"King Richard III." (i. 2), Lady Anne, speaking of the corpse of King
Henry the Sixth, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Poor key-cold figure of a holy king."</span>

</div>

In the "Rape of Lucrece" (1. 1774) the same expression is used—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And then in key-cold Lucrece's bleeding stream  
 He falls, and bathes the pale fear in his face."</span>

</div>

In Beaumont and Fletcher's "Wild Goose Chase" (iv. 3), we read—"For till
they be key-cold dead, there's no trusting of ’em." <span
id="fr_594"></span>[1](#fn_592.md)

   Another common remedy was the one alluded to in "King Lear" (iii. 7),
where one of the servants says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs  
 To apply to his bleeding face."</span>

</div>

This passage has been thought to be parodied in Ben Jonson's play, "The
Case is Altered" (ii. 4)—"Go, get a white of .an egg and a little flax,
and close the breach of the head, it is the most conducible thing that
can be." Mr Gifford, however, has shown the incorrectness of this
assertion, pointing out that Jonson's play was written in 1599, some
years before "King Lear" appeared, while the allusion is "to a method of
cure common in Jonson's time to every barber-surgeon and old woman in
the kingdom." <span id="fr_595"></span>[2](#fn_593.md)

   Cobwebs are still used to staunch the bleeding from small wounds, and
Bottom's words seem to refer to this remedy of domestic surgery—"I shall
desire you of more acquaintance, good master Cobweb; if I cut my finger,
I shall make bold with you."

   Anciently, says Mr Singer, "a superstitious belief was annexed to the
accident of bleeding at the nose," hence in the "Merchant of Venice"
(ii. 5), Launcelot says—"It was not

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

for nothing that my nose fell a bleeding on Black Monday last." In days
gone, it was customary with our forefathers to be bled periodically, in
spring and in autumn, in allusion to which custom King Richard II. (i.
1), refers, when he says to his uncle—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Our doctors say this is no month to bleed."</span>

</div>

Hence the almanacks of the time generally gave particular seasons as the
most beneficial for bleeding. The forty-seventh aphorism of Hippocrates
(sect. 6), is that "persons who are benefited by venesection or purging,
should be bled or purged in the spring."

   *Blindness*.—The exact meaning of the term "sand-blind," which occurs
in the "Merchant of Venice" (ii. 2), is somewhat obscure—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Launcelot*. O heavens, this is my true-begotten
father! who, being more than sand-blind, high gravel blind, knows me
not.  
              \*          \*          \*          \*          \*  
 *Gobbo*. Alack, sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not."</span>

</div>

It probably means very dim-sighted, <span
id="fr_596"></span>[1](#fn_594.md) and in Nares’ "Glossary" <span
id="fr_597"></span>[2](#fn_595.md) it is thus explained:—"Having an
imperfect sight, as if there was sand in the eye." The expression is
used by Beaumont and Fletcher in "Love's Cure" (ii. 1)—"Why, signors,
and my honest neighbours, will you impute that as a neglect of my
friends, which is an imperfection in me? I have been *sand-blind* from
my infancy." The term was probably one in vulgar use. <span
id="fr_598"></span>[3](#fn_596.md)

   *Blister*.—In the following passage of "Timon of Athens" (v. 1),
Timon appears to refer to the old superstition that a lie produces a
blister on the tongue, though in the malice of his rage he imprecates
the minor punishment on truth, and the old surgery of cauterization on
falsehood <span id="fr_599"></span>[4](#fn_597.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou sun, that comfort’st, burn! speak, and be
hang'd;  
 For each true word, a blister! and each false  
 Be as a cauterizing to the root o’ the tongue,  
 Consuming it with speaking."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We may also
compare the passage in "Winter's Tale" (ii. 2), where Paulina declares—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If I prove honey-mouth’d, let my tongue blister  
 And never to my red-look’d anger be  
 The trumpet any more." <span id="fr_600"></span>[1](#fn_598.md)</span>

</div>

   *Bone-ache*.—This was a nickname in bygone years for the *Lues
venerea*, an allusion to which we find in "Troilus and Cressida" (ii.
3), where Thersites speaks of "the bone-ache as the curse dependant on
those that war for a placket." Another name for this disease was the
"brenning or burning," a notice of which we find in "King Lear" (iv. 6).

   *Bubukle*.—According to Johnson this denoted "a red pimple." Nares
says it is "a corrupt word for a carbuncle or something like; and Mr
Halliwell-Phillipps, in his "Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial
Words," defines it as a botch or imposthume. It occurs in "King Henry
V." (iii. 6), where Fluellen describes Bardolph's face "as all
bubukles."

   *Bruise*.—A favourite remedy in days past for bruises was parmaceti,
a corruption of spermaceti, in allusion to which Hotspur, in "1 Henry
IV." (i. 3), speaks of it as "the sovereign’st thing on earth for an
inward bruise." So, too, in Sir T. Overbury's "Characters," 1616 \[An
Ordinarie Fencer\], "His wounds are seldom skin-deepe; for an *inward
bruise* lamb-stones and sweetbreads are his only spermaceti." A
well-known plant called the "Shepherd's Purse," has been popularly
nicknamed the "Poor Man's Parmacetti," being a joke on the Latin word
*bursa*, a purse, which, to a poor man, is always the best remedy for
his bruises. <span id="fr_601"></span>[2](#fn_599.md) In "Romeo and Juliet"
(i. 2), a plantain leaf is pronounced to be an excellent cure "for your
broken shin." "Plantain water was a remedy in common use with the old
surgeons." <span id="fr_602"></span>[3](#fn_600.md)

   *Burn*.—The notion of one heat driving out another gave rise to the
old-fashioned custom of placing a burnt part

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

near the fire to drive out the fire,—a practice, says Dr Bucknill, <span
id="fr_603"></span>[1](#fn_601.md) certainly not without benefit, acting on
the same principle as the application of turpentine and other stimulants
to recent burns. This was one of the many instances of the ancient
homoeopathic doctrine, that what hurts will also cure. <span
id="fr_604"></span>[2](#fn_602) Thus, in "King John" (iii. 1.md), Pandulph
speaks of it:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire  
 Within the scorched veins of one new burn’d."</span>

</div>

Again, in the "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (ii. 4), Proteus tells how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Even as one heat another heat expels,  
 Or as one nail by strength drives out another,  
 So the remembrance of my former love  
 Is by a newer object quite forgotten."</span>

</div>

We may also compare the words of Mowbray in "King Richard II." (i. 1),
where a similar idea is contained:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am disgraced, impeach’d, and baffled here,  
 Pierced to the soul with slander's venom’d spear,  
 The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood  
 Which breathed this poison."</span>

</div>

Once more, in "Romeo and Juliet" (i. 2) Benvolio relates how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"One fire burns out another's burning,  
 One pain is lessen’d by another's anguish;  
 Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;  
 One desperate grief cures with another's anguish."</span>

</div>

   *Cataract*.—One of the popular names for this disease of the eye was
the "web and the pin." Markham in his "Cheap and Good Husbandry" (Bk. i.
chap. 37), thus describes it in horses:—"But for the wart, pearle, pin
or web, which are evils grown in or upon the eye, to take them off, take
the juyce of the herb betin and wash the eye therewith, it will weare
the spots away." Florio ("Ital. Dict."), gives the following:—"Cataratta
is a dimnesse of sight occasioned by humores hardened in the eies called
a cataract or a pin and a web." Shakespeare uses the term in the
"Winter's Tale" (i. 2), where Leontes speaks of "all eyes blind with the
pin and web but theirs," and in "King Lear" (iii. 4), alluding to

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "the foul fiend
Flibbertigibbet," says "he gives the web and the pin." <span
id="fr_605"></span>[1](#fn_603) Acerbi, in his "Travels" (ii. 290.md), has
given the Lapland method of cure for this disease. In a fragment of an
old medical treatise, it is thus described:—"Another sykenes ther byth
of *yezen;* *on a webbe*, a nother a wem, that hydyth the myddel of the
yezen; and this hes to maners, other whilys he is white and thynne, and
other whilys he is thykke, as whenne the obtalmye ne is noght clene
yhelyd up, bote the rote abydyth stylle. Other whilys the webbe is noght
white but rede, other blake." <span id="fr_606"></span>[2](#fn_604.md) In
the Statute of the 34 and 35 of "Henry VIII." a pin and web in the eye
is recited among the "customable diseases," which honest persons, not
being surgeons, might treat with herbs, roots, and waters, with the
knowledge of whose nature God had endowed them.

   *Chilblains*.—These are probably alluded to by the Fool in "King
Lear" (i. 5):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If a man's brains were in 's heels, were’t not in
danger of kibes."</span>

</div>

Hamlet, too, says (v. 1):—"The age is grown so picked that the toe of
the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he galls his kibe."

   *Deformity*.—It was an old prejudice which is not quite extinct that
those who are defective or deformed are marked by nature as prone to
mischief. Thus in "King Richard III." (i. 3), Margaret says of Richard,
Duke of Gloster:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou elvish-mark’d, abortive, rooting hog!  
 Thou that was seal’d in thy nativity,  
 The slave of nature and the son of hell."</span>

</div>

She calls him *hog*, in allusion to his cognizance, which was a boar. A
popular expression in Shakespeare's day for a deformed person was a
"stigmatic." It denoted anyone who had been *stigmatised*, or burnt with
an iron, as an ignominious punishment; and hence was employed to
represent a person on whom nature has set a mark of deformity. Thus in
"3 Henry VI." (ii. 2), Queen Margaret says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;  
 But like a foul misshapen stigmatic</span>

</div>

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span>  Mark’d by the destinies to be avoided,  
 As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings."</span>

</div>

Again in "2 Henry VI." (v. 1), young Clifford says to Richard:—"Foul
stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell." We may note, too, how in
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" (v. 1), mothers’ marks and congenital forms
are deprecated by Oberon from the issue of the happy lovers:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And the blots of Nature's hand  
 Shall not in their issue stand;  
 Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,  
  Nor mark prodigious, such as are  
 Despised in nativity,  
 Shall upon their children be." <span
id="fr_607"></span>[1](#fn_605.md)</span>

</div>

   Indeed, constant allusions are to be met with in our old writers
relating to this subject, showing how strong were the feelings of our
forefathers on the point. But, to give one further instance of this
superstition given by Shakespeare, we may quote the words of King John
(iv. 2), with reference to Hubert and his supposed murder of Prince
Arthur:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A fellow by the hand of nature mark’d,  
 Quoted and sign’d to do a deed of shame,  
 This murder had not come into my mind."</span>

</div>

   This adaptation of the mind to the deformity of the body concurs,
too, with Bacon's theory:—"Deformed persons are commonly even with
nature, for, as nature hath done ill by them, so do they by nature,
being void of natural affection, and so they have their revenge on
nature."

   *Drowning*.—The old superstition <span
id="fr_608"></span>[2](#fn_606.md) of its being dangerous to save a person
from drowning is supposed, says Mr Halliwell-Phillipps, to be alluded to
in "Twelfth Night." It was owing to the belief that the person saved
would sooner or later injure the man who saved him. Thus, in Sir Walter
Scott's "Pirate," Bryce, the pedlar, warns the hero not to attempt to
resuscitate an inanimate form, which the waves had washed ashore on the
mainland of Shetland. "\`Are you mad,'

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

exclaimed the pedlar, 'you that have lived sae lang in Zetland, to risk
the saving of a drowning man? Wot ye not if ye bring him to life again,
he will do you some capital injury.'"

   *Epilepsy*.—A popular name for this terrible malady was the "Falling
Sickness," because, when attacked with one of these fits, the patient
falls suddenly to the ground. In "Julius Cæsar," (i. 2), it is thus
mentioned in the following dialogue:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Cassius*. But, soft, I pray you: what, did Cæsar
swoon?  
 *Casca*. He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at mouth, and was
speechless.  
 *Brutus*. ’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness.  
 *Cassius*. No, Cæsar hath it not, but you and I,  
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness."</span>

</div>

   *Fistula*.—At the present day a fistula means an abscess external to
the rectum, but in Shakespeare's day it was used in the more general
signification for a burrowing abscess in any situation. <span
id="fr_609"></span>[1](#fn_607.md) The play of "All's Well that Ends Well"
has a special interest, because, as Dr Bucknill says, its very plot may
be said to be medical. "The orphan daughter of a physician cures the
king of a fistula by means of a secret remedy left to her as a great
treasure by her father. The royal reward is the choice of a husband
among the nobles of the court, and 'thereby hangs the tale.'" The story
is taken from the tale of Gilletta of Narbonne, in the Decamerone of
Boccaccio. It came to Shakespeare through the medium of Painter's
"Palace of Pleasure," and is to be found in the first volume, which was
printed as early as 1566. <span id="fr_610"></span>[2](#fn_608.md) The
story is thus introduced by Shakespeare in the following dialogue (i.
1), where the Countess of Rousillon is represented as inquiring:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?  
 *Lafeu*. He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose practices
he hath persecuted time with hope; and finds no other
[advantage](errata.htm#8.md) in the process but only the losing of hope by
time.  
 *Count*. This young gentlewoman had a father—O, that 'had!' how sad a
passage ’tis!—whose skill was almost as great as his honesty;</span>

</div>

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">had it stretched so far, would have made nature
immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
king's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of the king's
disease.  
 *Laf*. How called you the man you speak of, madam?  
 *Count*. He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great
right to be so; Gerard de Narbon.  
 *Laf*. He was excellent, indeed, madam; the king very lately spoke of
him admiringly and mourningly; he was skilful enough to have lived
still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.  
 *Ber*. What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?  
 *Laf*. A fistula, my lord."</span>

</div>

   The account given of Helena's secret remedy and the King's reason for
rejecting it, give, says Dr Bucknill, "an excellent idea of the state of
opinion with regard to the practice of physic in Shakespeare's time."

   *Fit*.—Formerly the term "rapture" was synonymous with a fit or
trance. The word is used by Brutus in "Coriolanus" (ii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "Your prattling nurse  
Into a rapture lets her baby cry  
While she chats him."</span>

</div>

   Steevens quotes from the "Hospital for London's Follies" (1602) where
Gossip Luce says.—"Your darling will weep itself into a rapture, if you
take not good heed." <span id="fr_611"></span>[1](#fn_609.md)

   *Gold*.—It was a long prevailing opinion that a solution of gold had
great medicinal virtues; and that the incorruptibility of the metal
might be communicated to a body impregnated with it. Thus in "2 Henry
IV." (iv. 4) Prince Henry, in the course of his address to his father,
says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">“Coming to look on you thinking you dead,  
 And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,  
 I spake unto this crown as having sense  
 And thus upbraided it: ‘The care on thee depending  
 Hath fed upon the body of my father;  
 Therefore, thou best of gold are worst of gold;  
 Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,  
 Preserving life in medicine potable.’”</span>

</div>

   Potable gold was one of the panaceas of ancient quacks. In John
Wight's translation of the "Secretes of Alexis" is a receipt "to
dissolve and reducte golde into a potable licour, which conserveth the
youth and healthe of a man, and will

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

heale every disease that is thought incurable, in the space of seven
daies at the furthest." The receipt, however, is a highly complicated
one, the gold being acted upon by juice of lemons, honey, common salt,
and *aqua vitæ*, and distillation frequently repeated from an "urinall
of glass,"—as the oftener it is distilled, the better it is. "Thus
doyng," it is said, "ye shall have a right naturall, and perfecte
potable golde, whereof somewhat taken alone every monthe once or twice,
or at least with the said licour, whereof we have spoken in the second
chapter of this boke, is very excellent to preserve a man's youthe and
healthe, and to heale in a fewe daies any disease rooted in a man, and
thought incurable. The said gold will also be good and profitable for
diverse other operations and effectes: as good wittes and diligent
searchers of the secretes of nature may easily judge." A further
allusion to gold as a medicine is probably alluded to in "All's Well
that Ends Well" (v. 3) where the King says to Bertram—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                            "Plutus himself,  
That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,  
Hath not in nature's mystery more science  
Than I have in this ring."</span>

</div>

   Chaucer, too, in his sarcastic excuse for the doctor's avarice refers
to this old belief—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And yet he was but esy of despence:  
 He kept that he wan in the pestilence.  
 For gold in physic is a cordial;  
 Therefore he loved it in special."</span>

</div>

   Once more, in Sir Kenelm Digby's *Receipts* (A.D. 1674) we are told
that the gold is to be calcined with three salts, ground with sulphur,
burnt in a reverbatory furnace with sulphur twelve times, then digested
with spirit of wine "which will be tincted very yellow, of which, few
drops for a dose in a fit vehicle hath wrought great effects."

   The term "grand liquor" is also used by Shakespeare for the aurum
potabile of the alchymist, as in "Tempest" (iv. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "Where should they  
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded them."</span>

</div>

   *Good Year*.—This is evidently a corruption of goujere, a disease
derived from the French gouge, a common camp-follower,

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

and probably alludes to the *Morbus Gallicus*. Thus, in "King Lear (v.
3), we read—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,  
 Ere they shall make us weep."</span>

</div>

With the corruption, however, of the spelling, the word lost in time its
real meaning, and it is consequently found in passages where a sense
opposite to the true one is intended. <span
id="fr_612"></span>[1](#fn_610.md) It was often used in exclamations, as in
"Merry Wives of Windsor" (i. 4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"We must give folks leave to prate: what, the
good-jer!"</span>

</div>

In "Troilus and Cressida" (v. 1) Thersites, by the "rotten diseases of
the south" probably meant the "Morbus Gallicus."

   *Handkerchief*.—It was formerly a common practice in England for
those who were sick to wear a kerchief on their heads, and still
continues at the present day among the common people in many places.
Thus, in "Julius Cæsar" (ii. 1), we find the following allusion:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Brutus*. O, what a time have you chose out, brave
Caius,  
 To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick."</span>

</div>

   "If," says Fuller, "this county (Cheshire) hath bred no writers in
that faculty (physic), the wonder is the less, if it be true what I
read, that if any here be sick, they make him a posset and tye a
kerchief on his head, and if that will not mend him, then God be
merciful to him."—*Worthies of England*, 1662, p. 180.

   *Hysteria*.—This disorder which, in Shakespeare's day, we are told,
was known as "the mother," or "hysterica passio," was not considered
peculiar to women only. It is probable that when the poet wrote the
following lines in "King Lear" (ii. 4), where he makes the king say—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!  
 *Hysterica passio!* down, thou climbing sorrow,  
 Thy element's below!—Where is this daughter?"</span>

</div>

he had in view the subjoined passages from Harsnet's "Declaration of
Popish Impostures" (1603), a work which, it has been suggested, <span
id="fr_613"></span>[2](#fn_611.md) "he may have consulted in order to

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

furnish out his character of Tom of Bedlam with demoniacal gibberish."
The first occurs at p. 25:—"Ma. Maynie had a spice of the *hysterica
passio*, as it seems, from his youth; hee himselfe termes it the moother
(as you may see in his confessione). Master Richard Mainy, who was
persuaded by the priests that he was possessed of the devil, deposes as
follows (p. 263):—The disease I speake of was a spice of the Mother,
wherewith I had been troubled (as is before mentioned) before my going
into Fraunce. Whether I doe rightly *terme* it the mother or no I know
not." Dr Jordan, in 1603, published "A Briefe Discourse of a Disease
called the Suffocation of the Mother."

   *Infection*.—According to an old, but erroneous belief, infection
communicated to another left the infector free, in allusion to which
Timon (iv. 3) says,—"I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns to thine
own lips again."

   Among other notions prevalent in days gone by was the general
contagiousness of disease, to which an allusion seems to be made in "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" (i. 1), where Helena says,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,  
 Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go."</span>

</div>

   Malone considers that Shakespeare, in the following passage in "Venus
and Adonis" alludes to a practice of his day, when it was customary, in
time of the plague, to strew the rooms of every house with rue and other
strong-smelling herbs to prevent infection

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Long may they kiss each other, for this cure!  
 O never let their crimson liveries wear!  
 And as they last, their verdure still endure  
 To drive infection from the dangerous year."</span>

</div>

Again, the contagiousness of pestilence is thus alluded to by Beatrice
in "Much Ado about nothing" (i. 1):—O Lord, he will hang upon him like a
disease; he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs
presently mad." The belief too, that the poison of pestilence dwells in
the air is spoken of in "Timon of Athens" (iv. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                          "When Jove  
Will o’er some high-viced city hang his poison  
In the sick air."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

And again, in "King Richard II." (i. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Devouring pestilence hangs in our air."</span>

</div>

It is alluded to also in "Twelfth Night" (i. 1), where the Duke says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,  
 Methought she purged the air of pestilence!"</span>

</div>

   While on this subject, we may quote the following dialogue from the
same play (ii. 3), which, as Dr Bucknill <span
id="fr_614"></span>[1](#fn_612.md) remarks, "involves the idea that
contagion is bound up with something appealing to the sense of smell, a
mellifluous voice being miscalled contagious; unless one could apply one
organ to the functions of another, and thus admit contagion, not through
its usual portal, the nose":—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Sir Andrew*. A mellifluous voice, as I am true
knight.  
 *Sir Toby*. A contagious breath.  
 *Sir Andrew*. Very sweet and contagious, i’ faith.  
 *Sir Toby*. To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion."</span>

</div>

   *Insanity*.—That is a common idea that the symptoms of madness are
increased by the full moon. Shakespeare mentions this popular fallacy in
"Othello" (v. 2), where he tells us that the moon makes men insane, when
she comes nearer the earth than she was wont. <span
id="fr_615"></span>[2](#fn_613.md)

   Music, as a cure for madness, is perhaps referred to in "King Lear"
(iv. 7), where the physician of King Lear says:—"Louder the musick
there." <span id="fr_616"></span>[3](#fn_614.md) Mr Singer, however, has
this note:—"Shakespeare considered soft music favourable to sleep. Lear,
we may suppose, had been thus composed to rest; and now the physician
desires louder music to be played, for the purpose of waking him."

   So in "Richard II." (v. 5), the king says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This music mads me; let it sound no more:  
 For though it holp madmen to their wits,  
 In me it seems it will make wise men mad."</span>

</div>

   The power of music as a medical agency, has been recognized from the
earliest times, and in mental cases has often

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

been highly efficacious. <span id="fr_617"></span>[1](#fn_615.md) Referring
to music as inducing sleep, we may quote the touching passage in "2
Henry IV." (iv. 5), where the King says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;  
 Unless some dull and favourable hand  
 Will whisper music to my weary spirit.  
 *Wor*. Call for the music in the other room."</span>

</div>

Ariel in the "Tempest" (ii. 1) enters playing solemn music to produce
this effect.

   A mad-house seems formerly to have been designated a "dark-house."
Hence in the "Twelfth Night" (iii. 4), the reason for putting Malvolio
into a dark room, was to make him believe that he was mad. In the
following act (iv. 2) he says, "Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad,
they have laid me here in hideous darkness," and further on (v. 1), he
asks," Why have you suffer’d me to be imprison’d, kept in a dark-house?"

   In "As You Like It" (iii. 2), Rosalind says that "love is merely a
madness, and deserves as well a dark-house and a whip, as madmen do."

   The expression "horn-mad," *i.e.* quite mad, occurs in the "Comedy of
Errors" (ii. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad."</span>

</div>

And again, in "The Merry Wives of Windsor" (i. 4), Mistress Quickly
says, "If he had found the young man, he would have been horn-mad."

   Madness in cattle was supposed to arise from a distemper in the
internal substance of their horns, and furious or mad cattle had their
horns bound with straw.

   *King's Evil*.—This was a common name in years gone by for scrofula,
because the sovereigns of England were supposed to possess the power of
curing it, "without other medicine, save only by handling and prayer."
This custom of "touching for the king's evil" is alluded to in "Macbeth"
(iv. 3), where the following dialogue is introduced:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Malcolm*. Comes the king forth, I pray you?  
 *Doctor*. Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls  
 That stay his cure; their malady convinces  
 The great assay of art; but at his touch—</span>

</div>

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"> <span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span> Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand—  
 They presently amend.  
 *Malcolm*. I thank you, doctor.  
 *Macduff*. What's the disease he means?  
 *Malcolm*. ’Tis call’d the evil:  
 A most miraculous work in this good king;  
 Which often, since my here-remain in England,  
 I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,  
 Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,  
 All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,  
 The mere despair of surgery, he cures,  
 Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,  
 Put on with holy prayers: and ’tis spoken,  
 To the succeeding royalty he leaves  
 The healing benediction. With this strange virtue  
 He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;  
 And sundry blessings hang about his throne,  
 That speak him full of grace."</span>

</div>

This reference, which has nothing to do with the progress of the drama,
is introduced obviously in compliment to King James, who fancied himself
endowed with the confessor's powers. <span
id="fr_618"></span>[1](#fn_616.md) The poet found authority for the passage
in Holinshed (i. 279)—"As hath bin thought, he was enspired with the
gift of prophecie, and also to haue hadde the gift of healing
infirmities and diseases. Namely, he vsed to help those that were vexed
with the disease, commonly called the kyngs euill, and left that vertue
as it were a portion of inheritance vnto his successors the kyngs of
this realme." Edward's miraculous powers were believed in, we are told,
by his contemporaries, or at least soon after his death, and were
expressly recognised by Pope Alexander III., who canonized him. In
Plot's "Oxfordshire" (chap. x. sec. 125) there is an account,
accompanied with a drawing, of the touch piece supposed to have been
given by this monarch. James First's practice of touching for the evil
is frequently mentioned in Nichols’ "Progresses." Charles I., when at
York, touched seventy persons in one day. Indeed, few are aware to what
an extent this superstition once prevailed. In the course of twenty
years, between 1660 and 1682, no less than 92,107 persons were touched
for this disease. The

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

first English monarch who refused to touch for the King's Evil was
William III., but the practice was resumed by Queen Anne, who officially
announced, in the "London Gazette," March 12, 1712, her royal intention
to receive patients afflicted with the malady in question. It was
probably about that time that Johnson was touched by her Majesty, upon
the recommendation of the celebrated physician Sir John Floyer, of
Lichfield. King George I. put an end to this practice, which is said to
have originated with Edward the Confessor in 1058. <span
id="fr_619"></span>[1](#fn_617.md) The custom was also observed by French
kings, and on Easter Sunday, 1686, Louis XIV. is said to have touched
1600 persons.

   *Lethargy*.—This is frequently confounded by medical men of former
times, and by Shakespeare himself, with apoplexy. The term occurs in the
list of diseases quoted by Thersites in "Troilus and Cressida" (v.
1). <span id="fr_620"></span>[2](#fn_618.md)

   *Leprosy*.—This was in years gone by used to denote the *lues
venerea*, as in "Antony and Cleopatra" (iii. 8)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">         "Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,  
Whom leprosy o’ertake!  
Hoists sail and flies."</span>

</div>

   *Leech*.—The old medical term for a leech is a "bloodsucker," and a
knot would be an appropriate term for a number of clustering leeches. So
in "Richard III." (iii. 3), Grey being led to the block, says of
Richard's minions—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A knot you are of damned blood-suckers."</span>

</div>

In "2 Henry VI." (iii. 2), mention is made by Warwick of the
"bloodsucker of sleeping men," which, says Dr Bucknill, appears to mean
the vampire bat.

   *Measles*.—This word originally signified leprosy, although in modern
times used for a very different disorder. Its derivation is the old
French word *meseau*, or *mesel*, a leper. Thus Cotgrave has "meseau, a
meselled, scurvy, leaporous, lazarous person." Distempered, or scurvied
hogs are still said to be measled. It is in this sense that Coriolanus
uses it (iii. 1):—

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As for my country I have shed my blood,  
 Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs  
 Coin words till their decay against those measels,  
 Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought  
 The very way to catch them."</span>

</div>

   *Pleurisy*.—This denotes a plethora, or redundancy of blood, and was
so used probably from an erroneous idea that the word was derived from
*plus pluris*. It is employed by Shakespeare in "Hamlet" (iv. 7)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For goodness, growing to a plurisy  
 Dies in his own too much."</span>

</div>

In the "Two Noble Kinsmen" (v. 1), there is a similar phrase:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                    "That heal’st with blood  
The earth when it is sick, and cur’st the world  
O’ the plurisy of people."</span>

</div>

The word is frequently used by writers contemporary with Shakespeare.
Thus, for instance, Massinger in "The Picture" (iv. 2), says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A plurisy of ill blood you must let out  
 By labour."</span>

</div>

   *Mummy*.—This was a preparation, for magical purposes, made from dead
bodies, and was used as a medicine both long before and long after
Shakespeare's day. Its virtues seem to have been chiefly imaginary, and
even the traffic of it fraudulent. <span id="fr_621"></span>[1](#fn_619.md)
The preparation of mummy is said to have been first brought into use in
medicine by a Jewish physician, who wrote that flesh thus embalmed was
good for the cure of divers diseases, and particularly bruises, to
prevent the blood's gathering and coagulating. It has, however, long
been known that no use whatever can be derived from it in medicine, and
"that all which is sold in the shops, whether brought from Venice or
Lyons, or even directly from the Levant by Alexandria, is factitious,
the work of certain Jews, who counterfeit it by drying carcases in
ovens, after having prepared them with powder of Myrrh, caballine aloes,
Jewish pitch, and other coarse or unwholesome drugs." <span
id="fr_622"></span>[2](#fn_620.md) Shakespeare speaks of this preparation.
Thus Othello (iii. 4),

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

referring to the handkerchief which he had given to Desdemona relates
how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"It was dyed in mummy which the skilful  
 Conserved of maidens’ hearts."</span>

</div>

And in "Macbeth" (iv. 1), the "Witches' Mummy" forms one of the
ingredients of the boiling cauldron. Webster in "The White Devil" (1857,
p. 5), speaks of it:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "Your followers  
Have swallow’d you like mummia, and, being sick,  
With such unnatural and horrid physic,  
Vomit you up i’ the kennel."</span>

</div>

Sir Thomas Browne, in his interesting Fragment on Mummies, <span
id="fr_623"></span>[1](#fn_621.md) tells us that Francis the First always
carried mummy with him as a panacea against all disorders. Some used it
for epilepsy, some for gout, some used it as a stiptic. He further adds:
"The common opinion of the virtues of mummy bred great consumption
thereof, and princes and great men contended for this strange panacea,
wherein Jews dealt largely, manufacturing mummies from dead carcases,
and giving them the names of kings, while specifics were compounded from
crosses and gibbets leavings."

   *Nightmare*.—There are various charms practised in this and other
countries for the prevention of nightmare, many of which are exceedingly
quaint. In days gone by it appears that St Vitalis, whose name has been
corrupted into St. Withold, was invoked; and by way of illustration
Theobald quotes from the old play of "King John" <span
id="fr_624"></span>[2](#fn_622.md) the following:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sweet S. Withold of thy lenitie, defend us from
extremitie."</span>

</div>

Shakespeare alluding to the nightmare in his "King Lear" (iii. 4),
refers to the same Saint, and gives us a curious old charm:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"S. Withold footed thrice the old; \[wold\]  
 He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;  
   Bid her alight  
   And her troth plight,  
 And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

For what purpose, as Mr Singer <span id="fr_625"></span>[1](#fn_623.md) has
pointed out, the incubus is enjoined to "plight her troth" will appear
from a charm against the nightmare in Reginald Scot's "Discovery of
Witchcraft," which occurs with slight variation in Fletcher's "Monsieur
Thomas" (iv. 6):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"St George, St George, our lady's knight,  
 He walks by day, so does he by night,  
 And when he had her found,  
 He her beat and her bound,  
 Until to him her troth she plight,  
 She would not stir from him that night."</span>

</div>

   *Paralysis*.—An old term for chronic paralysis was "cold palsies,"
which is used by Thersites in "Troilus and Cressida" (v. 1). <span
id="fr_626"></span>[2](#fn_624.md)

   *Philosopher's Stone*.—This was supposed by its touch to convert base
metal into gold. It is noticed by Shakespeare in "Antony and Cleopatra"
(i. 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Alexas*.             Sovereign of Egypt, hail!  
 *Cleopatra*. How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!  
 Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath  
 With his tinct gilded thee."</span>

</div>

   The alchymists call the matter, whatever it may be, says Johnson, by
which they perform transmutation a medicine. Thus Chapman in his "Shadow
of Night" (1594)—"O then, thou great elixir of all treasures;" on which
passage he has the following note:—"The philosopher's stone, or
*philosophica medicina*, is called the *great elixir*." Another
reference occurs in "Timon of Athens" (ii. 1) where the Fool in reply to
the question of Varro's servant, "What is a whoremaster, fool?"
answers—"A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. ’Tis a spirit:
sometime ’t appears like a lord; sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a
philosopher, with two stones moe than's artificial one," etc., a passage
which Johnson explains as meaning "more than the philosopher's stone,"
or twice the value of a philosopher's stone; though, as Farmer observes,
"Gower has a chapter in his 'Confessio Amantis,' of the three stones
that philosophers made." Singer, <span id="fr_627"></span>[3](#fn_625.md)
in his note on the philosopher's stone, says

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

that Sir Thomas Smith was one of those who lost considerable sums in
seeking of it. Sir Richard Steele was one of the last eminent men who
entertained hopes of being successful in this pursuit. His laboratory
was at Poplar. <span id="fr_628"></span>[1](#fn_626.md)

   *Pimple*.—In the Midland Counties a common name for a pimple, which
by rubbing is made to smart, or rubbed to sense, is "a quat." The word
occurs in "Othello" (v. 1) where Roderigo is so called by Iago—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I have rubb’d this young quat almost to the
sense,  
 And he grows angry."</span>

</div>

—Roderigo being called a quat by the same mode of speech as a low fellow
is now called a *scab*. It occurs in Langham's "Garden of Health," p.
1.53—"The leaves \[of coleworts\] laid to by themselves, or bruised with
barley meale, are good for the inflammations, and soft swellings,
burnings, impostumes, and cholerick sores or gnats," etc.

   *Plague*.—"Tokens" or "God's tokens" were the terms for those spots
on the body which denoted the infection of the plague. In "Love's
Labour's Lost" (v. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For the lord's tokens on you do I see,"</span>

</div>

and in "Antony and Cleopatra" (iii. 10) there is another allusion—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Enobarbus*.      How appears the fight?  
 *Scarus*. On our side like the token’d pestilence,  
 Where death is sure."</span>

</div>

In "Troilus and Cressida" (ii. 3) Ulysses says of Achilles—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"He is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it  
 Cry, 'no recovery.'"</span>

</div>

King Lear, too, it would seem, compares Goneril (ii. 4) to these fatal
signs, when he calls her "a plague sore." When the tokens had appeared
on any of the inhabitants, the house was shut up, and "Lord have mercy
upon us" written or printed upon the door. Hence Biron in "Love's
Labour's Lost" (v. 2) says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Write, 'Lord have mercy on us,' on those there;  
 They are infected, in their hearts it lies,  
 They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

   The "red pestilence," referred to by Volumnia in "Coriolanus," (iv.
1), probably alludes to the cutaneous eruptions common in the plague:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,  
 And occupations perish."</span>

</div>

   In the "Tempest," (i. 2), Caliban says, to Prospero, "The red plague
rid you."

   *Poison*.—According to a vulgar error prevalent in days gone by,
poison was supposed to swell the body, an allusion to which occurs in
"Julius Cæsar," (iv. 3), where, in the quarrel between Brutus and
Cassius, the former declares:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"You shall digest the venom of your spleen,  
 Though it do split you."</span>

</div>

   We may also compare the following passage in "2 King Henry IV.," (iv.
4), where the king says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                           "Learn this, Thomas,  
And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,  
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,  
That the united vessel of their blood,  
Mingled with venom of suggestion,  
As, force perforce, the age will pour it in—  
Shall never leak, though it do work as strong  
As aconitum or rash gunpowder."</span>

</div>

   In "King John," Hubert, when describing the effect of the poison upon
the monk (v. 6), narrates how his "bowels suddenly burst out." This
passage also contains a reference to the popular custom prevalent in the
olden days, of great persons having their food tasted by those who were
supposed to have made themselves acquainted with its wholesomeness. This
practice, however, could not always afford security when the taster was
ready to sacrifice his own life, as in the present case <span
id="fr_629"></span>[1](#fn_627.md):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Hubert*. The king, I fear, is poisoned by a
monk:  
 I left him almost speechless. . . .  
 *Bastard*. How did he take it? Who did taste to him?  
 *Hubert*. A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

   The natives of Africa have been supposed to be possessed of the
secret how to temper poison with such art as not to operate till several
years after they were administered. Their drugs were then as certain in
their effect as subtle in their preparation. <span
id="fr_630"></span>[1](#fn_628) Thus, in the "Tempest," (iii. 3.md),
Gonzalo says of the fiends:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"All three of them are desperate: their great
guilt,  
 Like poison given to work a great time after,  
 Now ’gins to bite the spirits."</span>

</div>

   The belief, also, in slow poisoning was general in bygone times,
although no better founded on fact, remarks Dr Bucknill, <span
id="fr_631"></span>[2](#fn_629.md) than the notion that persons burst with
poison, or that narcotics could, like an alarum clock, be set for a
certain number of hours. So in "Cymbeline," (v. 5), Cornelius relates to
the king the queen's confession:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "She did confess she had  
For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,  
Should by the minute feed on life, and lingering  
By inches waste you."</span>

</div>

   *Pomander*.—This was either a composition of various perfumes wrought
in the shape of a ball or other form, and worn in the pocket or hung
about the neck, and even sometimes suspended to the wrist; or a case for
containing such a mixture of perfumes. It was used as an amulet against
the plague or other infections, as well as for an article of luxury.
There is an allusion to its use in "The Winter's Tale," (iv. 3), by
Autolycus, who enumerates it among all his trumpery that he had sold.
The following recipe for making a pomander we find in an old play <span
id="fr_632"></span>[3](#fn_630.md):—"Your only way to make a pomander is
this,—take an ounce of the purest garden mould, cleans’d and steep’d
seven days in change of motherless rose-water. Then take the best
labdanum, benjoin, with storaxes, ambergris, civet, and musk.
Incorporate them together, and work them into what form you please.
This, if your breath be not too valiant, will make you smell as sweet as
any lady's dog."

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

   *Rheumatism*.—In Shakespeare's day this was used in a far wider sense
than now-a-days, including, in addition to what is now understood by the
term, distillations from the head, catarrhs, &c. Malone quotes from the
"Sydney Memorials," (i. 94), where the health of Sir Henry Sidney is
described:—"He hath verie much distempored divers parts of his bodie; as
namelie, his heade, his stomack, &c., and thereby is always subject to
distillacions, coughes, and other rumatick diseases." Among the many
superstitions relating to the moon, <span
id="fr_633"></span>[1](#fn_631.md) one is mentioned in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream," (ii. 1), where Titania tells how the moon—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Pale in her anger, washes all the air,  
 That rheumatic diseases do abound."</span>

</div>

   The word "rheumatic" was also formerly used in the sense of choleric
or peevish, as in "2 Henry IV.," (ii. 4), where the hostess says:—"You
two never meet but you fall to some discord: you are both, i’ good
truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts." Again, in "Henry V.," (ii. 3),
the hostess says of Falstaff:—"A’ did in some sort, indeed, handle
women; but then he was rheumatic, <span id="fr_634"></span>[2](#fn_632.md)
and talked of the whore of Babylon."

   *Serpigo*.—This appears to have been a term extensively used by old
medical authors for any creeping skin disease; being especially applied
to that known as the *herpes circinatus*. The expression occurs in
"Measure for Measure" (iii. 1), being coupled by the Duke with "the
gout" and the "rheum." In "Troilus and Cressida" (ii. 3), Thersites
says:—"Now the dry serpigo on the subject."

   *Sickness*.—Sickness of stomach, which the slightest disgust is apt
to provoke, is still expressed by the term "queasy;" hence the word
denoted delicate, unsettled; as in "King Lear" (ii. 1), where it is used
by Edmund:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I have one thing, of a queasy question,  
 Which I must act."</span>

</div>

So Ben Jonson employs it in Sejanus (i. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"These times are rather queasy to be
touched."</span>

</div>

   *Sigh*.—It was a prevalent notion that sighs impair the

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

strength, and wear out the animal powers. Thus, in "2 Henry VI." (iii.
2), Queen Margaret speaks of "blood-drinking sighs." We may, too,
compare the words of Oberon in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (iii. 2), who
refers to "sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear." In "3 Henry
VI." (iv. 4), Queen Elizabeth says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">           "For this I draw in many a tear  
And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs."</span>

</div>

Once more in "Hamlet" (iv.. 7), the king mentions the "spendthrift's
sigh that hurts by easing." Fenton in his "Tragical Discourses." (1579),
alludes to this notion in the following words:—"Your scorching sighes
that have already drayned your body of his wholesome humoures."

   It was also an ancient belief that sorrow consumed the blood, and
shortened life. Hence Romeo tells Juliet (iii. 5),—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:  
 Dry sorrow drinks our blood."</span>

</div>

   *Small-pox*.—Such a terrible plague was this disease in the days of
our ancestors, that its name was used as an imprecation. Thus, in
"Love's Labour's Lost" (v. 2), the princess says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A pox of that jest."</span>

</div>

   *Saliva*.—The colour of the spittle was, with the medical men of
olden times, an important point of diagnosis. Thus in "2 Henry IV." (i.
2), Falstaff exclaims against fighting on a hot day, and wishes he may
"never spit white again," should it so happen. <span
id="fr_635"></span>[1](#fn_633.md)

   *Sterility*.—The charm against sterility referred to by Cæsar in
"Julius Cæsar" (i. 2), is copied from Plutarch, who, in his description
of the festival Lupercalia, tells us how "noble young men run naked
through the city, striking in sport whom they meet in the way with
leather thongs," which blows were commonly believed to have the
wonderful effect attributed to them by Cæsar—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The barren, touched in this holy chase,  
 Shake off their sterile curse."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

   *Suicide*.—Cominius, in "Coriolanus" (i. 9), arguing against
Marcius's overstrained modesty, refers to the manner in which suicide
was thought preventable in olden times—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If ’gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put
you,  
 Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,  
 Then reason safely with you."</span>

</div>

   *Toothache*.—It was formerly a common superstition—and one, too, not
confined to our own country—that toothache was caused by a little worm,
having the form of an eel, which gradually gnawed a hole in the tooth.
In "Much Ado About Nothing" (iii. 2), Shakespeare speaks of this curious
belief—

"*Don Pedro*. What! sigh for the toothache?  
    *Leonata*. Where is but a humour or a worm."

This notion was some years ago prevalent in Derbyshire, <span
id="fr_636"></span>[1](#fn_634.md) where there was an odd way of
extracting, as it was thought, the worm. A small quantity of a mixture,
consisting of dry and powdered herbs, was placed in some small vessel,
into which a live coal from the fire was dropped. The patient then held
his or her open mouth over the vessel, and inhaled the smoke as long as
it could be borne. The cup was then taken away, and in its place a glass
of water was put before the patient. Into this glass the person breathed
hard for a few moments, when it was supposed the grub or worm could be
seen in the water. In Orkney, too, toothache goes by the name of "the
worm," and, as a remedy, the following charm, called "wormy lines," is
written on a piece of paper, and worn as an amulet by the person
affected, in some part of his dress:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Peter sat on a marble stone weeping;  
 Christ came past, and said, 'What aileth thee, Peter?'  
 'O my Lord, my God, my tooth doth ache.'  
 'Arise, O Peter! go thy way; thy tooth shall ache no more.'"</span>

</div>

This notion is still current in Germany, and is mentioned by

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thorpe in his
"Northern Mythology" (iii. 167), who quotes a North German incantation,
beginning—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Pear tree, I complain to thee;  
 Three worms sting me."</span>

</div>

It is found, too, even in China and New Zealand, <span
id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_635.md) the following charm being used in the
latter country—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"An eel, a spiny back  
 True indeed, indeed: true in sooth, in sooth.  
 You must eat the head  
 Of said spiny back."</span>

</div>

   A writer in the *Athenaeum* (Jan. 28, 1860), speaking of the Rev. R.
H. Cobbold's "Pictures of the Chinese, Drawn by themselves," says—"The
first portrait is that of a quack doctress, who pretends to cure
toothache by extracting a maggot—the cause of the disorder. This is
done—or rather pretended to be done—by simply placing a bright steel pin
on the part affected, and tapping the pin with a piece of wood. Mr
Cobbold compares the operation to procuring worms for fishing, by
working a spade backwards and forwards in the ground. He and a friend
submitted to the process, but in a very sort time compelled the doctress
to subsist, by the excessive precautions they took against imposition."
We may further note that John of Gatisden, one of our oldest medical
authors, attributes decay of the teeth to "a humour or a worm." In his
"Rosa Anglica," <span id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_636.md) he says—"Si vermes
sint in dentibus, ℞, semen porri, seu lusquiami contere et misce cum
cera, pone super carbones, et fumus recipiatur per embotum, quoniam
sanat. Solum etiam semen lusquiami valet coctum in aqua calida, supra
quam aquam patiens palatum apertum si tenuerit, cadent vermes evidenter
vel in illam aquam, vel in aliam quæ ibi fuerit ibi posita. De myrrha et
aloe ponantur in dentem, ubi est vermis: semen caulis, et absinthium,
per se vermes interficit."

   *Tub-fast*.—In years past "the discipline of sweating in a heated tub
for a considerable time, accompanied with strict

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

abstinence, was thought necessary for the cure of venereal taint." <span
id="fr_639"></span>[1](#fn_637) Thus, in "Timon of Athens" (iv. 3.md),
Timon says to Timandra—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Be a whore still! they love thee not that use
thee;  
 Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.  
 Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves  
 For tubs and baths: bring down rose-cheeked youth  
 To the tub-fast and the diet."</span>

</div>

   As beef, too, was usually salted down in a tub, the one process was
jocularly compared to the other. So, in "Measure for Measure" (iii. 2),
Pompey, when asked by Lucio about his mistress, replies, "Troth, sir,
she hath eaten up all her beef, and she is herself in the tub." Again,
in "Henry V." (ii. 1), Pistol speaks of "the powdering tub of infamy."

   *Vinegar*.—In Shakespeare's day this seems to have been termed
"eisel" (from A.–S. aisel), being esteemed highly efficacious in
preventing the communications of the plague and other contagious
diseases. In this sense it has been used by Shakespeare in his 111th
sonnet—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Like a willing patient, I will drink  
 Potions of eisel, ’gainst my strong infection."</span>

</div>

m

   In a MS. Herbal in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge occurs
"acetorum, an<sup>ce</sup> vynegre or aysel." The word occurs again in
"Hamlet" (v. 1), where Laertes is challenged by Hamlet—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Woo’t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?"</span>

</div>

   The word woo’t in the northern counties is the common contraction of
wouldst thou, which is the reading of the old copies. In former years it
was the fashion with gallants to do some extravagant feat as a proof of
their love in honour of their mistresses, and among others the
swallowing of some nauseous potion was one of the most frequent. Hence
in the above passage some bitter potion is evidently meant, which it was
a penance to drink. Some are of opinion that *wormwood* is alluded to;
and Mr Singer thinks it probable that "the propoma called absinthites, a
nauseously bitter medicament then much in use, may have been in the
poet's mind

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

to drink up a quantity of which would be an extreme pass of amorous
demonstration." It has been suggested by a correspondent of "Notes and
Queries" <span id="fr_640"></span>[1](#fn_638.md) that the reference in
this passage from "Hamlet" is to a lake Esyl which figures in
Scandinavian legends. Messrs Wright and Clark, however, in their Notes
to "Hamlet" (1876, p. 218), say that they have consulted Mr Magnusson on
this point, and 'he writes as follows:—"No such lake as Esyl is known to
Norse mythology and folk-lore." Steevens supposes it to be the river
Yssell. <span id="fr_641"></span>[2](#fn_639.md)

   *Water-casting*.—The fanciful notion of recognising diseases by the
mere inspection of the urine was denounced years ago by an old statute
of the College of Physicians, as belonging to tricksters and impostors,
and any member of the college was forbidden to give advice by this
so-called "water-casting" without he also saw the patient. The statute
of the college runs as follows:—"Statuimus, et ordinamus, ut nemo, sive
socius, sive candidatus, sive permissus consilii quidquam impertiat
veteratoriis, et impostoribus, super urinarum nuda inspectione, nisi
simul ad ægrum vocetur, ut ibidem, pro re natû, idonea medicamenta ab
honesto aliquo pharmacopoea componenda præscribat." An allusion to this
vulgar error occurs in the "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (ii. 1), where,
after Speed has given to Valentine his amusing description of a lover,
in which, among other signs, are "to walk alone like one that had the
pestilence," and "to fast like one that takes diet," the following
quibble takes place upon the within and the without of the symptoms—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Valentine*. Are all these things perceived in
me?  
 *Speed*. They are all perceived without ye.  
 *Valentine*. Without me? they cannot.  
 *Speed*. Without you? nay, that's certain, for without you were so
simple, none else would: but you are so without these follies, that
these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an
urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on
your malady."</span>

</div>

   This singular pretence, says Dr Bucknill, <span
id="fr_642"></span>[3](#fn_640.md) is "alleged to have arisen, like the
barber surgery, from the ecclesiastical

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

interdicts upon the medical vocations of the clergy. Priests and monks
being unable to visit their former patients are said first to have
resorted to the expedient of divining the malady, and directing the
treatment upon simple inspection of the urine. However this may be, the
practice is of very ancient date." Numerous references to this piece of
medical quackery occur in many of our old writers, most of whom condemn
it in very strong terms. Thus Forestus in his "Medical Politics" speaks
of it as being, in his opinion, a practice altogether evil, and
expresses an earnest desire that medical men would combine to repress
it. Shakespeare gives a further allusion to it in the passage where he
makes Macbeth (v. 3) say—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If thou couldst, doctor, cast  
 The water of my land, and her disease,  
 And purge it to a sound and pristine health,  
 I would applaud thee to the very echo."</span>

</div>

And in "2 Henry IV." (i. 2) Falstaff asks the page, "What says the
doctor to my water?" and once more in "Twelfth Night" (iii. 4), Fabian,
alluding to Malvolio, says, "Carry his water to the wise woman."

   It seems probable, too, that in the "Merry Wives of Windsor" (ii. 3),
the term "mock-water" employed by the host to the French Dr Caius,
refers to the mockery of judging of diseases by the water or
urine,—"mock-water" in this passage being equivalent to "you pretending
water-doctor!"
