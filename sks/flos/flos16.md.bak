### CHAPTER XIV.

#### DEATH AND BURIAL.

<span class="smallcaps">From</span> a very early period there has
existed a belief in the existence of a power of prophecy at that period
which precedes death. It took its origin in the assumed fact that the
soul becomes divine in the same ratio as its connection with the body is
loosened. It has been urged in support of this theory that at the hour
of death the soul is, as it were, on the confines of two worlds, and may
possibly at the same moment possess a power which is both prospective
and retrospective. Shakespeare, in "Richard II." (ii. 1), makes the
dying Gaunt exclaim, alluding to his nephew, the young and self-willed
king—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Methinks I am a prophet new inspired  
 And thus expiring do foretell of him."</span>

</div>

Again, the brave Percy, in "1 Henry IV." (v. 4), when in the agonies of
death, expresses the same idea—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                    "O, I could prophesy,  
But that the earthy and cold hand of death  
Lies on my tongue."</span>

</div>

   We may also compare what Nerissa says of Portia's father in "Merchant
of Venice" (i. 2), "Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
death have good inspirations."

   Curious to say this notion may be traced up to the time of Homer.
Thus Patroclus prophesies the death of Hector ("Iliad," π. 852):—"You
yourself are not destined to live long, for even now death is drawing
nigh unto you, and a violent fate awaits you—about to be slain in fight
by the hands of Achilles." Aristotle tells us that the soul, when on the
point of death, foretells things about to happen. Others have

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

sought for the foundation of this belief in the 49th chapter of
Genesis:—"And Jacob called his sons, and said, Gather yourselves
together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last
days. And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered
up his feet into his bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered
unto his people." Whether, however, we accept this origin or not, at any
rate it is very certain that the notion in question has existed from the
earliest times, being alluded to also by Socrates, Xenophon, and
Diodorus Siculus. It still lingers on in Lancashire and other parts of
England.

   Among other omens of death may be mentioned high spirits, which have
been supposed to presage impending death. Thus, in "Romeo and Juliet"
(v. 3), Romeo exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"How oft when men are at the point of death  
 Have they been merry! which their keepers call  
 A lightning before death."</span>

</div>

   This idea is noticed by Ray, who inserts it as a proverb, "It's a
lightening before death;" and adds this note: "This is generally
observed of sick persons, that a little before they die their pains
leave them, and their understanding and memory return to them—as a
candle just before it goes out gives a great blaze." It was also a
superstitious notion that unusual mirth was a forerunner of adversity.
Thus, in the last act of "Romeo and Juliet" (1), Romeo comes on saying—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,  
 My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:  
 My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;  
 And all this day an unaccustom’d spirit  
 Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts."</span>

</div>

Immediately, however, a messenger enters to announce Juliet's death.

   In "King Richard III." (iii. 2), Hastings is represented as rising in
the morning in unusually high spirits. Stanley says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,  
 Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,  
 And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;  
 But yet, you see, how soon the day o’ercast."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This idea, it may
be noted, runs throughout the whole scene. Before dinner-time, Hastings
was beheaded.

   Once more, in "2 Henry IV." (iv. 2), the same notion is alluded to in
the following dialogue:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Westmoreland*. Health to my lord and gentle
cousin,  
    *Mowbray*. Mowbray. You wish me health in very happy season;  
 For I am, on the sudden, something ill.  
    *Arch*. Against ill chances men are ever merry;  
 But heaviness foreruns the good event.  
    *West*. Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow  
 Serves to say thus, 'Some good thing comes to-morrow.'  
    *Arch*. Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.  
    *Mowb*. So much the worse, if your own rule be true."</span>

</div>

   Tytler, in his "History of Scotland," thus speaks of the death of
King James I.—"On this fatal evening (Feb. 20, 1436), the revels of the
Court were kept up to a late hour. The prince himself appears to have
been in unusually gay and cheerful spirits. He even jested, if we may
believe the contemporary manuscript, about a prophecy which had declared
that a king that year should be slain." Shelley strongly entertained
this superstition—"During all the time he spent in Leghorn, he was in
brilliant spirits, to him a sure prognostic of coming evil."

   Again, it is a very common opinion that death announces its approach
by certain mysterious noises, a notion, indeed, which may be traced up
to the time of the Romans, who believed that the genius of death
announced his approach by some supernatural warning. In "Troilus and
Cressida" (iv. 4), Troilus says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hark! you are call’d: some say, the Genius so  
 Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die."</span>

</div>

This superstition was frequently made use of by writers of bygone times,
and often served to embellish, with touching pathos, their poetic
sentiment. Thus Flatman, in some pretty lines, has embodied this
thought—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My soul, just now about to take her flight,  
 Into the regions of eternal night,  
 Methinks I hear some gentle spirit say,  
 Be not fearful, come away."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

   Pope speaks in the same strain—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hark! they whisper, angels say,  
 Sister spirit, come away."</span>

</div>

   Shakespeare, too, further alludes to this idea in "Macbeth" 3),
where, it may be remembered, Lennox graphically describes how, on the
awful night in which Duncan is so basely murdered—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,  
 Lamentings heard i’ the air; strange screams of death,  
 And prophesying with accents terrible  
 Of dire combustion and confused events,  
 New hatch’d to the woeful time."</span>

</div>

   As in Shakespeare's day, so, too, at the present time, there is
perhaps no superstition so deeply rooted in the minds of many people as
the belief in what are popularly termed "death-warnings." Modern
folk-lore holds either that a knocking or rumbling in the floor is an
omen of a death about to happen, or that dying persons themselves
announce their dissolution to their friends in such strange
sounds. <span id="fr_733"></span>[1](#fn_731.md) Many families are supposed
to have particular warnings, such as the appearance of a bird, the
figure of a tall woman, etc. Such, moreover, are not confined to our own
country, but in a variety of forms are found on the continent. According
to another belief, it was generally supposed that when a man was on his
death-bed, the devil or his agents tried to seize his soul, if it should
happen that he died without receiving the sacrament of the eucharist, or
without confessing his sins. Hence, in "2 Henry VI." (iii. 3), the king
says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O, beat away the busy meddling fiend  
 That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul,  
 And from his bosom purge this black despair."</span>

</div>

   In the old office books of the church, these "busy meddling fiends"
are often represented with great anxiety besieging the dying man; but on
the approach of the priest and his attendants, they are shown to display
symptoms

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

of despair at their impending discomfiture. Douce <span
id="fr_734"></span>[1](#fn_732.md) quotes from an ancient manuscript book
of devotion, written in the reign of Henry the Sixth, the following
prayer to St George:—"Judge for me whan the moste hedyous and damnable
dragons of helle shall be redy to take my poore soule and engloute it in
to theyr infernall belyes."

   Some think that the "passing bell," which was formerly tolled for a
person who was dying, was intended to drive away the evil spirit that
might be hovering about to seize the soul of the deceased. <span
id="fr_735"></span>[2](#fn_733.md)\* Its object, however, was probably to
bespeak the prayers of the faithful, and to serve as a solemn warning to
the living. Shakespeare has given several touching allusions to it.
Thus, in his seventy-first sonnet he says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"No longer mourn for me when I am dead  
 Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell  
 Give warning to the world that I am fled  
 From this vile world."</span>

</div>

In "2 Henry IV." (i. 1), Northumberland speaks in the same strain—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news  
 Hath but a losing office, and his tongue  
 Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,  
 Remember’d tolling a departing friend."</span>

</div>

We may quote a further allusion in "Venus and Adonis" (701)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And now his grief may be compared well  
 To one sore sick that hears the passing bell."</span>

</div>

   In a statute passed during the reign of Henry VIII., it is ordered
"that clarks are to ring no more than the passing bell for poare people,
nor less for an honest householder, and he be a citizen; nor for
children, maydes, journeymen, apprentices, daylabourers, or any other
poare person." In 1662, the Bishop of Worcester <span
id="fr_736"></span>[3](#fn_734.md)\* asks in his visitation charge:—"Doth
the parish clerk or sexton take care to admonish the living, by tolling
of a passing-bell of any that are dying,

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

thereby to meditate of their own deaths, and to commend the other's weak
condition to the mercy of God." It was, also, called the "soul-bell,"
upon which Bishop Hall remarks—"We call it the soul-bell because it
signifies the departure of the soul, not because it helps the passage of
the soul." Ray in his "Collection of Proverbs" has the following
couplet—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When thou dost hear a toll or knell  
 Then think upon thy passing bell."</span>

</div>

It was formerly customary to draw away the pillow from under the heads
of dying persons, so as to accelerate their departure—an allusion to
which we find in "Timon of Athens" (iv. 3), where Timon says

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Pluck stout men's pillows from below their
heads."</span>

</div>

This, no doubt, originated in the notion that a person cannot die
happily on a bed with pigeons’ feathers. Grose says:—"It is impossible
for a person to die whilst resting on a pillow stuffed with the feathers
of a dove; but that he will struggle with death in the most exquisite
torture. The pillows of dying persons are therefore frequently taken
away when they appear in great agonies, lest they may have pigeon's
feathers in them." Indeed, in Lancashire, this practice is carried to
such an extent that some will not allow dying persons to lie on a
feather bed, because they hold that it very much increases their pain
and suffering, and actually retards their departure. <span
id="fr_737"></span>[1](#fn_735.md)

   The departure of the human soul from this world, and its journey to
its untried future, have become interwoven with an extensive net-work of
superstitions, varying more or less in every country and tribe.
Shakespeare has alluded to the numerous destinations of the disembodied
spirit, enumerating the many ideas prevalent in his time on the subject.
In "Measure for Measure" (iii. 1), Claudio thus speaks:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;  
 To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;</span>

</div>

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span>  This sensible warm motion to become  
 A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit  
 To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside  
 In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;  
 To be imprison’d in the viewless winds,  
 And blown with restless violence round about  
 The pendent world." <span id="fr_738"></span>[1](#fn_736.md)</span>

</div>

We may compare also the powerful language of Othello (v. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,  
 And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!  
 Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!  
 Whip me, ye devils.  
 From the possession of this heavenly sight!  
 Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulphur!  
 Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!  
 O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!"</span>

</div>

Douce <span id="fr_739"></span>[2](#fn_737.md) says that in the former
passage it is difficult to decide whether Shakespeare is alluding to the
pains of hell or purgatory. Both passages are obscure, and have given
rise to much criticism. It seems probable, however, that whilst partly
referring to the notions of the time, relating to departed souls,
Shakespeare has in a great measure incorporated the ideas of what he had
read in books of Catholic divinity. The passages quoted above remind us
of the legend of St. Patrick's purgatory, where mention is made of a
lake of ice and snow into which persons were plunged up to their necks;
and of the description of hell, given in the "Shepherd's Calendar"

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"—a great froste in a water rounes  
 And after a bytter wynde comes  
 Which gothe through the soules with eyre;  
 Fends with pokes pulle theyr flesshe ysondre,  
 They fight and curse, and eche on other wonder."</span>

</div>

We cannot here enter, however, into the mass of mystic details
respecting "the soul's dread journey <span
id="fr_740"></span>[3](#fn_738.md) by caverns and rocky paths and weary
plains, over steep and slippery mountains, by frail bank or giddy
bridge, across gulfs or

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

rushing rivers, abiding the fierce onset of the soul-destroyer or the
doom of the stern guardian of the other world." Few subjects indeed have
afforded greater scope for the imagination than the hereafter of the
human soul, and hence, as might be expected, numerous myths have been
invented in most countries to account for its mysterious departure in
the hour of death, from the world of living men to its unseen, unknown
home in the distant land of Spirits.

   Shakespeare several times uses the word "limbo" in a general
signification for hell, as in "Titus Andronicus" (iii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As far from help as Limbo is from bliss."</span>

</div>

And in "All's Well That Ends Well" (v. 3), Parolles says—"For indeed he
was mad for her, and talked of Satan, and of Limbo, and of Furies, and I
know not what." In "Henry VIII." (v. 4), "In Limbo Patrum" is jocularly
put for a prison; and again, in "Comedy of Errors" (iv. 2), "He's in
Tartar limbo." "According to the schoolmen, *Limbus Patrum* was the
place, bordering on hell, where the souls of the patriarchs and saints
of the Old Testament remained till the death of Christ, who, descending
into hell, let them free." <span id="fr_741"></span>[1](#fn_739.md)

   One of the punishments invented of old for the covetous and
avaricious in hell was to have melted gold poured down their throats, to
which allusion is made by Flaminius in "Timon of Athens" (iii. 1), who,
denouncing Lucullus for his mean insincerity towards his friend Timon,
exclaims, on rejecting the bribe offered him to tell his master that he
had not seen him—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"May these add to the number that may scald thee!  
 Let molten coin be thy damnation."</span>

</div>

   In the "Shepherd's Calendar," Lazarus declares himself to have seen
covetous men and women in hell dipped in caldrons of molten lead. Malone
quotes the following from an old black-letter ballad of "The Dead Man's
Song"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Ladles full of melted gold  
 Were poured down their throats."</span>

</div>

Crassus was so punished by the Parthians. <span
id="fr_742"></span>[2](#fn_740.md)

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

   There is possibly a further allusion to this imaginary punishment in
"Antony and Cleopatra" (ii. 5), where Cleopatra says to the Messenger—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">          "But, sirrah, mark, we use  
To say the dead are well; bring it to that,  
The gold I give thee will I melt and pour  
Down thy ill-uttering throat."</span>

</div>

   According to a well-known superstition among sailors, it is
considered highly unlucky to keep a corpse on board, in case of a death
at sea. Thus, in "Pericles" (iii. 1), this piece of folk-lore is alluded
to—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"1 *Sail*. Sir, your queen must overboard; the sea
works high, the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be cleared
of the dead.  
    *Per*. That's your superstition.  
    1 *Sail*. Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been still
observed; and we are strong in custom. Therefore briefly yield her; for
she must overboard straight."</span>

</div>

   It was also a popular opinion that death is delayed until the ebb of
the tide—a superstition to which Mrs Quickly refers, in "Henry V." (ii.
3), speaking of Falstaff's death, she says—"’A made a finer end and went
away an it had been any christom child; ’a parted even just between
twelve and one, even at the turning o’ the tide." Hence, in cases of
sickness, many pretended that they could foretell the hour of the soul's
departure. It may be remembered how Mr Peggotty explained to David
Copperfield, by poor Barkis's bedside, that "people can't die along the
coast except when the tide's pretty nigh out. They can't be born unless
it's pretty nigh in—not properly born till flood. He's agoing out with
the tide—he's agoing out with the tide. It's ebb at half-arter three,
slack-water half-an-hour. If he lives till it turns he'll hold his own
till past the flood, and go out with the next tide." Mr Henderson <span
id="fr_743"></span>[1](#fn_741.md) quotes from the parish register of
Heslidon, near Hartlepool, the subjoined extracts of old date, in which
the state of the tide at the time of death is mentioned—

   "The xi<sup>th</sup> daye of Maye, A.D. 1595, at vi. of ye clocke in
the morninge, being full water, Mr Henrye Mitford, of

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hoolam, died at
Newcastel, and was buried the xvi<sup>th</sup> daie, being Sondaie, at
evening prayer, the hired preacher maid ye sermon."

   "The xvii<sup>th</sup> daie of Maie, at xii. of ye clock at noon,
being lowe water, Mrs Barbara Mitford died, and was buried the
xviii<sup>th</sup> daie of Maie, at ix of the clocke. Mr Holsworth maid
ye sermon."

   According to Mr Henderson, this belief is common along the east coast
of England, from Northumberland to Kent. It has been suggested that
there may be "some slight foundation for this belief in the change of
temperature, which undoubtedly takes place on the change of tide, and
which may act on the flickering spark of life, extinguishing it as the
ebbing sea recedes."

   We may compare, too, the following passage in "2 Henry IV." (iv. 4),
where Clarence, speaking of the approaching death of the king, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The river hath thrice flow’d, no ebb between;  
 And the old folk, time's doting chronicles,  
 Say it did so a little time before  
 That our great grandsire, Edward, sick’d and died."</span>

</div>

   This was an historical fact, having happened on October 12th, 1411.

   The prayers of the Church which are used for the recovery of the sick
were, in the olden time, also supposed to have a morbific influence, to
which Gloucester attributes the death of the king in "1 Henry VI." (i.
1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The church! where is it? Had not churchmen
pray’d,  
 His thread of life had not so soon decay’d."</span>

</div>

Once more, the custom of closing the eyes at the moment of death is
touchingly referred to in "Antony and Cleopatra" (v. 2), where Charmian
may be supposed to close Cleopatra's eyes—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "Downy windows, close;  
And golden Phœbus never be beheld  
Of eyes again so royal."</span>

</div>

   Passing on from that solemn moment in human life when the soul takes
its flight from the fragile tenement of clay that

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

contained it during its earthly existence, we find that even among the
lowest savages there has generally been a certain respect paid to the
dead body; and consequently various superstitious rites have from time
to time been associated with its burial, which has been so appropriately
termed "the last act." Whilst occasionally speaking of death,
Shakespeare has not only pictured its solemnity in the most powerful and
glowing language, but, as opportunity allowed, given us a slight insight
into those customs that formerly prevailed in connection with the
committal of the body to its final resting place in the grave. At the
present day, when there is an ever-growing tendency to discard and
forget as irrational and foolish the customs of by-gone years, it is
interesting to find chronicled for all future time in the immortal pages
of our illustrious poet those superstitious rites and social usages
which may be said to have been most intimately identified with the age
to which they belonged. One custom, perhaps, that will always retain its
hold amongst us—so long as we continue to bury the remains of our
departed ones—is the scattering of flowers on their graves, a practice
indeed which may be traced up to Pagan times. It is frequently mentioned
by Shakespeare in some of his superb passages, as, for instance, in
"Cymbeline" (iv. 2), where Arviragus says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                          "With fairest flowers,  
Whilst summer lasts, and I live here, Fidele,  
I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack  
The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor  
The azured hare-bell, like thy veins; no, nor  
The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,  
Out-sweeten’d not thy breath.  
    .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .  
Yea, and furr’d moss besides, when flowers are none,  
To winter-ground thy corse."</span>

</div>

In "Hamlet" (iv. 5), the poor bewildered Ophelia sings—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Larded with sweet flowers;  
Which bewept to the grave did go  
     With true-love showers."</span>

</div>

Then further on (v. 1) there is the affecting flower-strewing

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

scene, where the Queen, standing over the grave of Ophelia, bids her a
long farewell—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sweets to the sweet, farewell!  
 I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;  
 I thought thy bride-bed to have deck’d, sweet maid,  
 And not have strew’d thy grave."</span>

</div>

   In "Romeo and Juliet" (iv. 5), Capulet says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Our bridal flowers serve for a buried
corse."</span>

</div>

And further on (v. 3) the Page says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"He came with flowers to strew his lady's
grave." <span id="fr_744"></span>[1](#fn_742.md)</span>

</div>

Once more, in "Pericles" (iv. 1), Marina is introduced, entering with a
basket of flowers, uttering these sad words—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,  
 To strew thy green with flowers; the yellows, blues,  
 The purple violets, and marigolds,  
 Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,  
 While summer-days do last."</span>

</div>

   Flowers, which so soon droop and wither, are indeed sweet emblems of
that brief life which is the portion of mankind in this world; while, at
the same time, their exquisite beauty is a further type of the glory
that awaits the redeemed hereafter, when, like fair flowers, they shall
burst forth in unspeakable grandeur on the resurrection morn. There is a
pretty custom observed in South Wales on Palm Sunday, of spreading fresh
flowers upon the graves of friends and relatives,—the day being called
Flowering Sunday.

   The practice of decorating the corpse is mentioned by many old
writers. In "Romeo and Juliet," (iv. 5), Friar Laurence says,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary  
 On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,  
 In all her best array bear her to church."</span>

</div>

   Queen Katharine, in "Henry VIII.," (iv. 2), directs,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">            "When I am dead, good wench,  
Let me be used with honour: strew me over  
With maiden flowers."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

   It was formerly customary, in various parts of England, to have a
garland of flowers and sweet herbs carried before a maiden's coffin, and
afterwards to suspend it in the church. In allusion to this practice the
priest in "Hamlet" (v. 1), says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Yet here she is allow’d her virgin crants,  
 Her maiden strewments and the bringing home  
 Of bell and burial."</span>

</div>

—crants <span id="fr_745"></span>[1](#fn_743.md) meaning garlands. It may
be noted that no other instance has been found of this word in English.
These garlands are thus described by Gay:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"To her sweet mem’ry flow’ry garlands strung,  
 On her now empty seat aloft were hung."</span>

</div>

   Nichols, in his "History of Lancashire," (ii., pt. i. 382), speaking
of Waltham in Framland Hundred, says: "In this Church, under every arch,
a garland is suspended, one of which is customarily placed there
whenever any young unmarried woman dies." Brand <span
id="fr_746"></span>[2](#fn_744.md) tells us he saw in the churches of
Wolsingham and Stanhope, in the County Durham, specimens of these
garlands; the form of a woman's glove, cut in white paper, being hung in
the centre of each of them.

   The funerals of knights and persons of rank were in Shakespeare's day
performed with great ceremony and ostentation. Sir John Hawkins observes
that "the sword, the helmet, the gauntlet, spens, and tabard are still
hung over the grave of every knight." In "Hamlet," (iv. 5), Laertes
speaks of this custom:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"His means of death, his obscure burial,  
 No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o’er his bones,  
 No noble rite, nor formal ostentation—  
 Cry to be heard, as ’twere from heaven to earth  
 That I must call’t in question."</span>

</div>

   Again, in "2 Henry VI.," (iv. 10), Iden says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Is’t Cade that I have slain, that monstrous
traitor?  
 Sword, I will hallow thee for this thy deed,  
 And hang thee o’er my tomb when I am dead."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

   The custom of bearing the dead body in its ordinary habiliments, and
with the face uncovered—a practice referred to in "Romeo and Juliet,"
(iv. 1),—appears to have been peculiar to Italy,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Then, as the manner of our country is,  
 In thy best robes uncover’d on the bier  
 Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault  
 Where all the kindreds of the Capulets lie."</span>

</div>

   In Coryat's "Crudities" (1776, ii. p. 27), the practice is thus
described:—"The burials are so strange, both in Venice and all other
cities, towns, and parishes of Italy, that they differ not only from
England, but from all other nations whatever in Christendom. For they
carry the corse to church with the face, hands, and feet all naked, and
wearing the same apparel that the person wore lately before it died, or
that which it craved to be buried in; which apparel is interred together
with their bodies. <span id="fr_747"></span>[1](#fn_745.md) Singer <span
id="fr_748"></span>[2](#fn_746.md) says that Shakespeare no doubt had seen
this custom particularly described in the "Tragicall History of Romeus
and Juliet,"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Another use there is, that whosoever dies,  
 Borne to the Church, with open face upon the bier he lies,  
 In wonted weed attir’d, not wrapt in winding sheet."</span>

</div>

He alludes to it again in Ophelia's song in "Hamlet" (iv. 5):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"They bore him barefaced on the bier."</span>

</div>

It was in bygone times customary to bury the Danish kings in their
armour—hence the remark of Hamlet (i. 4), when addressing the Ghost:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "What may this mean,  
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel  
Revisit’st thus the glimpses of the moon,  
Making night hideous."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Shakespeare was
probably guilty of an anachronism in "Coriolanus" (v. 6), when he makes
one of the lords say:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "Bear from hence his body;  
And mourn you for him: let him be regarded  
As the most noble corse that ever herald  
Did follow to his urn,"</span>

</div>

the allusion being to the public funerals of English Princes, at the
conclusion of which a herald proclaimed the style of the deceased.

   We may compare what Queen Katharine says in "King Henry VIII." (iv.
2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"After my death I wish no other herald,  
 No other speaker of my living actions,  
 To keep my honour from corruption  
 But such an honest chronicler as Griffith."</span>

</div>

   It seems to have been the fashion, as far back as the thirteenth
century, to ornament the tombs of eminent persons with figures and
inscriptions on plates of brass; hence in "Love's Labour's Lost" (i. 1),
the King says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,  
 Live register’d upon our brazen tombs."</span>

</div>

   In "Much ado about Nothing" (v. 1), Leonato speaking of his
daughter's death says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb,  
 And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night."</span>

</div>

And also in a previous scene (iv. 1), this graceful custom is noticed:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Maintain a mourning ostentation  
 And on your family's old monument  
 Hang a mournful epitaph."</span>

</div>

It was also the custom, in years gone by, on the death of an eminent
person, for his friends to compose short laudatory verses, epitaphs,
&c., and to affix them to the hearse or grave with pins, wax, paste, &c.
Thus in "Henry V." (i. 2), Henry declares:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Either our history shall with full mouth  
 Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,</span>

</div>

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span>  Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,  
 Not worshipp’d with a waxen epitaph,"</span>

</div>

meaning, says Gifford, "I will either have my full history recorded with
glory, or lie in an undisturbed grave; not merely without an inscription
sculptured in stone, but un-worshipped, unhonoured, even by a waxen
epitaph." <span id="fr_749"></span>[1](#fn_747.md)

   We may also compare what Lucius says in "Titus Andronicus" (i. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy
friends,  
 Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb."</span>

</div>

The custom was still general when Shakespeare lived; many fine and
interesting examples existing in the old Cathedral of St. Paul's, and
other churches of London, down to the time of the Great Fire, in the
form of pensil-tables of wood and metal, painted or engraved with
poetical memorials, suspended against the columns and walls.

   "Feasts of the Dead," which have prevailed in this and other
countries from the earliest times are, according to some antiquarians,
supposed to have been borrowed from the *cæna feralis* of the Romans—an
offering, consisting of milk, honey, wine, olives, and strewed flowers,
to the ghost of the deceased. In a variety of forms this custom has
prevailed amongst most nations—the idea being that the spirits of the
dead feed on the viands set before them; hence the rite in question
embraced the notion of a sacrifice. In Christian times, however, these
funeral offerings have passed into commemorative banquets, under which
form they still exist amongst us. In allusion to these feasts, Hamlet
(i. 2), speaking of his mother's marriage, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "The funeral baked meats  
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables."</span>

</div>

   Again, in "Romeo and Juliet" (iv. 5), Capulet narrates how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"All things that we ordained festival,  
 Turn from their office to black funeral;  
 Our instruments to melancholy bells,  
 Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast."</span>

</div>

   Mr Tylor, <span id="fr_750"></span>[2](#fn_748.md) in discussing the
origin of funeral feasts, and

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

in tracing their origin back to the savage and barbaric times of the
institution of feast of departed souls, says we may find a lingering
survival of this old rite in the doles of bread and drink given to the
poor at funerals, and "soul-mass cakes" which peasant girls beg for at
farmhouses with the traditional formula,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Soul, soul, for a soul cake,  
 Pray you, mistress, a soul cake." <span
id="fr_751"></span>[1](#fn_749.md)</span>

</div>

   In the North of England, the funeral feast is called an "arval," and
the loaves that are sometimes distributed among the poor are termed
"arval bread."

   Among other funeral customs mentioned by Shakespeare, may be
mentioned his allusion to the burial service. Originally, before the
reign of Edward VI., it was the practice for the priest to throw earth
on the body in the form of a cross, and then to sprinkle it with holy
water. Thus, in the "Winter's Tale," (iv. 4), the Shepherd says,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me  
 Where no priest shovels in dust,"</span>

</div>

—implying, "I must be buried as a common malefactor, out of the pale of
consecrated ground, and without the usual rites of the dead,"—a
whimsical anachronism, as Mr Douce <span id="fr_752"></span>[2](#fn_750.md)
points out, when it is considered that the old Shepherd was a pagan, a
worshipper of Jupiter and Apollo.

   In "Antony and Cleopatra," (i. 3), we find an allusion to the
lachrymatory vials filled with tears, which the Romans were in the habit
of placing in the tomb of a departed friend. Cleopatra sorrowfully
exclaims,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O most false love!  
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill  
With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,  
In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be."</span>

</div>

   This is another interesting instance of Shakespeare's knowledge of
the manners of distant ages, showing how varied and extensive his
knowledge was, and his skill in applying it whenever occasion required.

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

   The winding or shrouding-sheet, in which the body was wrapped
previous to its burial, is alluded to in "Hamlet," (v. 1), in the song
of the clown,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,  
   For and a shrouding sheet:  
 O, a pit of clay for to be made  
   For such a guest is meet."</span>

</div>

   Again, in "A Midsummer Night's Dream," (v. 1), Puck says,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The screech owl, screeching loud,  
 Puts the wretch that lies in woe  
 In remembrance of a shroud."</span>

</div>

   Ophelia speaks of the shroud as white as the mountain snow ("Hamlet,"
iv. 5). The following song, too, in "Twelfth Night," (ii. 4), mentions
the custom of sticking yew in the shroud,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Come away, come away, death,  
   And in sad cypress let me be laid;  
 Fly away, fly away, breath:  
   I am slain by a fair cruel maid."

"My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,  
   O prepare it!  
 My part of death, no one so true  
   Did share it!"

</div>

To quote two further illustrations, Desdemona ("Othello," iv. 2) says to
Emilia, "Lay on my bed my wedding-sheets," and when in the following
scene Emilia answers—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I have laid those sheets you bade me on the
bed"</span>

</div>

Desdemona adds—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If I do die before thee, pr’ithee, shroud me  
 In one of those same sheets."</span>

</div>

—a wish, indeed, which her cruel fate so speedily caused to be realised.

   And in "3 Henry VI." (i. 1), we have King Henry's powerful words—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Think’st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,  
 Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?  
 No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;</span>

</div>

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span>  Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,  
 And now in England to our heart's great sorrow  
 Shall be my winding-sheet."</span>

</div>

   The custom still prevalent of carrying the dead to the grave with
music—a practice which existed in the primitive church—to denote that
they have ended their spiritual warfare, and are become conquerors,
formerly existed very generally in this country. <span
id="fr_753"></span>[1](#fn_751) In "Cymbeline" (iv. 2.md), Arviragus says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And let us, Polydore, though now our voices  
 Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,  
 As once our mother; use like note and words,  
 Save that Euriphile must be Fidele."</span>

</div>

   The tolling of bells at funerals is referred to in "Hamlet" (v. 1),
where the priest says of Ophelia—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                "—She is allow’d her virgin
crants,  
Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home  
Of bell and burial."</span>

</div>

   It has been a current opinion for centuries, that places of burial
are haunted with spectres and apparitions—a notion, indeed, that
prevailed as far back as the times of heathenism. Ovid speaks of ghosts
coming out of their sepulchres and wandering about; and Virgil, quoting
the popular opinion of his time, tells us how Moeris could call the
ghosts out of their sepulchres ("Bucol." viii. 98):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Mœrim, sæpe animas imis excire sepulcris,  
 Atque satas alio vidi traducere messes."</span>

</div>

Indeed, the idea of the ghost remaining near the corpse is of world-wide
prevalence; and as Mr Tylor <span id="fr_754"></span>[2](#fn_752.md) points
out, "through all the changes of religious thought from first to last in
the course of human history, the hovering ghosts of the dead make the
midnight burial-ground a place where men's flesh creeps with terror." In
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" (v. 1), Puck declares—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Now it is the time of night  
   That the graves all gaping wide,  
 Every one lets forth his sprite,  
   In the church-way paths to glide."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In the same play,
too, (iii. 2) Puck speaking of "Aurora's harbinger," says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and
there,  
 Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,  
 That in cross ways and floods have burial,  
 Already to their wormy beds are gone;  
 For fear lest day should look their shames upon."</span>

</div>

In this passage two curious superstitions are described;—the ghosts of
self-murderers, who are buried in cross-roads; and of those who have
been drowned at sea, being said to wander for a hundred years, owing to
the rites of sepulture having never been properly bestowed on their
bodies.

   We may further compare Hamlet's words (iii. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"’Tis now the very witching time of night;  
 When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out  
 Contagion to this world."</span>

</div>

   From the earliest period much importance has been attached to the
position of the grave, the popular direction being from east to west,
that from north to south being regarded not only dishonourable but
unlucky. Thus, in "Cymbeline" (iv. 2), Guiderius, when arranging about
the apparently dead body of Imogen, disguised in man's apparel, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;  
 My father had a reason for’t."</span>

</div>

   Indeed, the famous antiquary Hearne had such precise views in this
matter that he left orders for his grave to be made straight by a
compass, due east and west. This custom was practised by the ancient
Greeks, and thus, as Mr Tylor points out, <span
id="fr_755"></span>[1](#fn_753.md) it is not to late and isolated fancy,
but to the carrying on of ancient and widespread solar ideas, that we
trace the well-known legend that the body of Christ was laid with the
head towards the west, thus looking eastward, and the Christian usage of
digging graves east and west which prevailed through mediæval times, and
is not yet forgotten. The rule of laying the head to the west, and its
meaning that the dead shall rise looking towards the east, are perfectly
stated in the following passage from an ecclesiastical treatise

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

of the 16th century <span id="fr_756"></span>[1](#fn_754.md):—"Debet autem
quis sic sepeliri ut capite ad occidentem posito, pedes dirigat ad
Orientem, in quo quasi ipsa positione orat: et innuit quod promptus est,
ut de occasu festinet ad ortum: de mundo ad seculum." <span
id="fr_757"></span>[2](#fn_755.md)

   Within old monuments and receptacles for the dead perpetual lamps
were supposed to be lighted up, an allusion to which is made by Pericles
(iii. 1), who, deploring the untimely death of Thaisa at sea, and the
superstitious demand made by the sailors that her corpse should be
thrown overboard, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "Nor have I time  
To give thee hallow’d to thy grave, but straight  
Must cast thee, scarcely coffin’d, in the ooze;  
Where, for a monument upon thy bones,  
And e’er-remaining lamps, the belching whale  
And humming water must o’erwhelm thy corpse,  
Lying with simple shells."</span>

</div>

Again, in "Troilus and Cressida" (iii. 2), we find a further reference
in the words of Troilus—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O that I thought it could be in a woman,  
 To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love."</span>

</div>

Pope, too, in his "Eloisa to Abelard," has a similar allusion (1.
261–2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Ah, hopeless lasting flames, like those that burn  
 To light the dead, and warm th’ unfruitful urn!"</span>

</div>

   D’Israeli, in his "Curiosities of Literature," thus explains this
superstition—"It has happened frequently that inquisitive men, examining
with a flambeau ancient sepulchres which have just been opened, the fat
and gross vapours engendered by the corruption of dead bodies, kindled
as the flambeau approached them, to the great astonishment of the
spectators, who frequently cried out a miracle! This sudden
inflammation, although very natural, has given room to believe that
these flames proceeded from perpetual lamps,

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

which some have thought were placed in the tombs of the ancients, and
which, they said, were extinguished at the moment that these tombs
opened, and were penetrated by the exterior air." Mr Dennis, however, in
his "Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria" (1878, ii. p. 404), says that the
use of sepulchral lamps by the ancients is well known, and gave rise to
the above superstition. Sometimes lamps were kept burning in sepulchres
long after the interment, as in the case of the Ephesian widow,
described by Petronius ("Satyr," c. 13), who replaced the lamp placed in
her husband's tomb.

   A common expression formerly applied to the dead occurs in the
"Winter's Tale" (v. 1), where Dion asks—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "What were more holy,  
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?"</span>

</div>

So in "Antony and Cleopatra" (ii. 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Mess*. First, madam, he is well.  
*Cleo*. Why, there's more gold.  
But, sirrah, mark, we use  
To say the dead are well." <span id="fr_758"></span>[1](#fn_756.md)</span>

</div>

   Lastly, commentators have differed as to the meaning of the words of
Julia, in the "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (i. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I see you have a month's mind to them."</span>

</div>

Douce says she refers to the mind or remembrance days of our Popish
ancestors; persons in their wills having often directed that in a month,
or at some other specific time, some solemn office, as a mass or a
dirge, should be performed for the repose of their souls. Thus Ray
quotes a proverb, "To have a month's mind to a thing," and quotes the
above custom. For a further and not improbable solution of this
difficulty, the reader may consult Dyce's "Glossary" (p. 277).
