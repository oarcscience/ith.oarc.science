### CHAPTER IV.

#### DEMONOLOGY AND DEVIL LORE.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> state of popular feeling in past
centuries with regard to the active agency of devils has been well
represented by Reginald Scot, who in his work on witchcraft has shown
how the superstitious belief in demonology was part of the great system
of witchcraft. Many of the popular delusions of this terrible form of
superstition have been in a masterly manner exposed by Shakespeare, and
the scattered allusions which he has given illustrative of it are indeed
sufficient to prove, if it were necessary, what a highly elaborate creed
it was. Happily Shakespeare, like the other dramatists of the period,
has generally treated the subject with ridicule, showing that he had no
sympathy with the grosser opinions shared by various classes in those
times, whether held by king or clown. According to an old belief, still
firmly credited in the poet's day, it was supposed that devils could at
any moment assume whatever form they pleased that would most conduce to
the success of any contemplated enterprise they might have in hand; and
hence the charge of being a devil, so commonly brought against innocent
and harmless persons in former years, can easily be understood. Amongst
the incidental allusions to this notion given by Shakespeare, Prince Hal
("1 Henry IV.," ii. 4) tells Falstaff "there is a devil haunts thee in
the likeness of an old fat man;" "an old white-bearded Satan." In the
"Merchant of Venice" (iii. 1) Salanio, on the approach of Shylock,
says—"Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my prayer, for
here he comes in the likeness of a Jew."

   Indeed "all shapes that man goes up and down in" seem

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

to have been at the devil's control, a belief referred to in "Timon of
Athens" (ii. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">   *Var. Serv.* What is a whoremaster, fool?  
   *Fool*. A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. ’Tis a
spirit: sometime ’t appears like a lord; sometime like a lawyer;
sometime like a philosopher, with two stones moe than’s artificial one:
he is very often like a knight; and, generally, in all shapes that man
goes up and down in from fourscore to thirteen, this spirit walks
in."</span>

</div>

   A popular form assumed by evil spirits was that of a negro or moor,
to which Iago alludes when he incites Brabantio to search for his
daughter in "Othello" (i. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Zounds, sir, you're robb’d; for shame, put on your
gown;  
 Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;  
 Even now, now, very now, an old black ram  
 Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise;  
 Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,  
 Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:  
 Arise, I say."</span>

</div>

   On the other hand, so diverse were the forms which devils were
supposed to assume that they are said occasionally to appear in the
fairest form, even in that of a girl (ii. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When devils will the blackest sins put on,  
 They do suggest at first with heavenly shows."</span>

</div>

So in "The Comedy of Errors" (iv. 3) we have the following dialogue—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Ant. S.* Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me
not!  
 *Dro. S.* Master, is this mistress Satan?  
 *Ant. S.* It is the devil.  
 *Dro. S.* Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here she comes
in the habit of a light wench; and thereof comes that the wenches say,
God damn me;' that's as much to say, 'God make me a light wench.' It is
written, they appear to men like angels of light."</span>

</div>

(Cf. also "Love's Labour's Lost," iv. 3.) In "King John" (iii. 1) even
the fair Blanche seemed to Constance none other than the devil tempting
Lewis "in likeness of a new untrimmed bride."

   Not only, too, were devils thought to assume any human shape they
fancied, but, as Mr Spalding remarks, <span
id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md) "the forms

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

of the whole of the animal kingdom appear to have been at their
disposal; and, not content with these, they seem to have sought for
unlikely shapes to appear in"—the same characteristic belonging also to
the fairy tribe.

   Thus when Edgar is trying to persuade the blind Gloucester that he
has in reality cast himself over the cliff, he describes the being from
whom he is supposed to have just departed—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As I stood here below, methought his eyes  
 Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses.  
 Horns welk’d and waved like the endridged sea:  
 It was some fiend."</span>

</div>

Again, Edgar says ("King Lear," iii. 6)—"The foul fiend haunts poor Tom
in the voice of a nightingale"—the allusion probably being to the
following incident related by Friswood Williams:—"There was also another
strange thing happened at Denham about a bird. Mistris Peckham had a
nightingale which she kept in a cage, wherein Maister Dibdale took great
delight, and would often be playing with it. The nightingale was one
night conveyed out of the cage, and being next morning diligently sought
for, could not be heard of, till Maister Mainie's devil, in one of his
fits (as it was pretended), said that the wicked spirit which was in
this examinate's sister had taken the bird out of the cage and killed it
in despite of Maister Dibdale." <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82.md)

   Even the shape of a fly was a favourite one with evil spirits, so
much so, that the term "fly" was a popular synonym for a familiar. In
"Titus Andronicus" (iii. 2) there is an allusion to this belief where
Marcius, being rebuked by Titus for having killed a fly, gives as his
reason—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">              "It was a black ill-favour’d fly,  
Like to the empress’ Moor: therefore I kill’d him."</span>

</div>

   Mr Spalding gives the following illustrations of the superstition:
"At the execution of Urban Grandier, the famous magician of London, in
1634, a large fly was seen buzzing about the stake; and a priest
promptly seizing the opportunity of improving the occasion for the
benefit of the onlookers, declared that Beelzebub had come in his own
proper person

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

to carry off Grandier's soul to hell. In 1664 occurred the celebrated
witch trials which took place before Sir Matthew Hale. The accused were
charged with bewitching two children, and part of the evidence against
them was that flies and bees were seen to carry into their victims’
mouths the nails and pins which they afterwards vomited."

   Once more, another form devils assumed was that of a dead friend.
Thus Hamlet (i. 4), when he confronts the apparition, exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Angels and ministers of grace defend us!  
 Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn’d,  
 Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,  
 Be thine intents wicked or charitable,  
 Thou comest in such a questionable shape  
 That I will speak to thee."</span>

</div>

for, as Mr Spalding remarks, "it cannot be imagined that Hamlet imagined
that a 'goblin damned' could actually be the spirit of his dead father;
and, therefore, the alternative in his mind must be that he saw a devil
assuming his father's likeness—a form which the Evil One knew would most
incite Hamlet to intercourse."

   The same idea seems present in Horatio's mind:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,  
 Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff,  
 That beetles o’er his base into the sea,  
 And there assume some horrible form,  
 Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,  
 And draw you into madness?"</span>

</div>

   Once more, in the next act (ii. 2), Hamlet again expresses his
doubts:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The spirit that I have seen  
 May be the devil: and the devil hath power  
 To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps  
 Out of my weakness and my melancholy,  
 As he is very potent with such spirits,  
 Abuses me to damn me."</span>

</div>

   In the Elizabethan times, too, no superstitious belief exerted a more
pernicious and baneful influence on the credulous and ignorant than the
notion that evil spirits from time to time entered into human beings,
and so completely gained a despotic control over them as to render them
perfectly

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

helpless. Harsnet, in his "Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures"
(1603), has exposed this gross superstition; and a comparison of the
passages in "King Lear," spoken by Edgar when feigning madness with
those given by Harsnet, will show that Shakespeare has accurately given
the contemporary belief on the subject. Mr Spalding also considers that
nearly all the allusions in "King Lear" refer to a youth known as
Richard Mainey, a minute account of whose supposed possession has been
given by Harsnet.

   Persons so possessed were often bound and shut up in a dark room,
occasionally being forced to submit to flagellation—a treatment not
unlike that described in "Romeo and Juliet" (i. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Not mad, but bound more than a madman is,  
 Shut up in prison, kept without my food,  
 Whipp’d and tormented."</span>

</div>

   In the "Comedy of Errors" (iv. 4) we have an amusing scene, further
illustrative probably of the kind of treatment adopted in Shakespeare's
day:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">   "*Courtesan*. How say you now? Is not your
husband mad?  
    *Adriana*. His incivility confirms no less.  
 Good doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;  
 Establish him in his true sense again,  
 And I will please you what you will demand.  
    *Luciana*. Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!  
    *Courtesan*. Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!  
    *Pinch*. Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.  
    *Ant. F.* There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.  
    *Pinch*. I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,  
 To yield possession to my holy prayers,  
 And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight,  
 I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven."</span>

</div>

   Pinch further says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"They must be bound and laid in some dark
room."</span>

</div>

   As Brand remarks, <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md) there is no
vulgar story of the devil's having appeared anywhere without a cloven
foot. In graphic representations he is seldom or never pictured without
one.

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In the following
passage, where Othello is questioning whether Iago is a devil or not, he
(v. 2) says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.  
 If that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee."</span>

</div>

   Dr Johnson gives this explanation, "I look towards his feet to see
if, according to the common opinion, his feet be cloven."

   In Massinger's "Virgin Martyr" (iii. 3), Harpax, an evil spirit,
following Theophilus in the shape of a secretary, speaks thus of the
superstitious Christian's description of his infernal enemy—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll tell you what now of the devil,  
 He's no such horrid creature; cloven-footed,  
 Black, saucer-ey’d, his nostrils breathing fire,  
 As these lying Christians make him."</span>

</div>

#### GOOD AND EVIL DEMONS.

   It was formerly commonly believed that not only kingdoms had their
tutelary guardians, but that every person had his particular genius or
good angel, to protect and admonish him by dreams, visions, &c. <span
id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84) Hence in "Antony and Cleopatra" (ii. 3.md),
the soothsayer speaking of Cæsar says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O Antony, stay not by his side,  
 Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is  
 Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,  
 Where Cæsar's is not, but, near him thy angel  
 Becomes a fear, as being o’erpower’d."</span>

</div>

   Thus Macbeth (iii. 1), speaks in a similar manner in defence to
Banquo:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "There is none but he  
Whose being I do fear; and, under him,  
My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,  
Mark Antony's was by Cæsar."</span>

</div>

   So too, in 2 Henry IV. (i. 2), the Chief-Justice says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"You follow the young prince up and down, like his
ill angel."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

   We may quote a further reference in "Julius Cæsar" (iii. 2), where
Antony says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For Brutus, as you know, was Cæsar's angel."</span>

</div>

   In the Roman world, says Mr Tylor in his "Primitive Culture" (1873,
ii. 202), "each man had his 'genius natalis,' associated with him from
birth to death, influencing his action and his fate, standing
represented by its proper image, as a lar among the household gods, and
at weddings and joyous times, and especially on the anniversary of the
birthday when genius and man began their united career, worship was paid
with song and dance to the divine image, adorned with garlands, and
propitiated with incense and libations of wine. The demon or genius was,
as it were, the man's companion soul, a second spiritual ego. The
Egyptian astrologer warned Antonius to keep far from the young Octavius,
'For thy demon,' said he, 'is in fear of his.'"

   The allusion by Lady Macbeth (i. 5), in the following passage is to
the "Spirits of Revenge":—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                         "Come, you spirits  
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,  
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full  
Of direst cruelty."</span>

</div>

   In Nash's "Pierce Pennilesse" we find a description of these spirits
and of their office. "The second kind of devils which he most employeth
are those northern *Martii*, called the *Spirits of Revenge*, and the
authors of massacres and seed-men of mischief, for they have commission
to incense men to rapine, sacrilege, theft, murder, wrath, fury, and all
manner of cruelties; and they command certain of the southern spirits to
wait upon them, as also great Arioch, that is termed the Spirit of
Revenge." In another passage we are further told how "the spirits of the
aire will mixe themselves with thunder and lightning, and so infect the
clime where they raise any tempest, that suddenly great mortalitie shall
ensue of the inhabitants." "Aerial spirits or devils," according to
Burton's "Anatomy of Melancholy," "are such as keep quarter most part in
the aire, cause many tempests, thunder and lightnings, tear oakes, fire
steeples, houses, strike men and beasts, etc." Thus in "King John" (iii.
2), the bastard remarks:—

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;  
 Some airy devil hovers in the sky  
 And pours down mischief."</span>

</div>

   It was anciently supposed that all mines of gold, &c., were guarded
by evil spirits. Thus Falstaff in 2 Henry IV. (iv. 3) speaks of
"learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil." This superstition still
prevails, and has been made the subject of many a legend. Thus it is
believed by the peasantry living near Largo-Law, Scotland, that a rich
mine of gold is concealed in the mountain. "A spectre once appeared
there, supposed to be the guardian of the mine, who being accosted by a
neighbouring shepherd, promised to tell him at a certain time and on
certain conditions, where 'the gowd mine is in Largo-Law,' especially
enjoining that the horn sounded for the housing of the cows at the
adjoining farm of Balmain should not blow. Every precaution having been
taken, the ghost was true to his tryst; but, unhappily, when he was
about to divulge the desired secret, Tammie Norrie, the cowherd of
Balmain, blew a blast, whereupon the ghost vanished with the
denunciation—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">'Woe to the man that blew the horn,  
 For out of the spot he shall ne’er be borne.'</span>

</div>

The unlucky horn-blower was struck dead, and as it was found impossible
to remove the body, a cairn of stones was raised over it." <span
id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85.md)

   Steevens considers that when Macbeth (iii. 2) says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;  
 Whiles night's black agents to their preys do rouse,"</span>

</div>

he refers to those demons who were supposed to remain in their several
places of confinement all day, but at the close of it were released;
such, indeed, as are mentioned in the "Tempest" (v. 1), as rejoicing "to
hear the solemn curfew, because it announced the hour of their freedom."

   Amongst other superstitions we may quote one in the "Merchant of
Venice" (iii. 1) where Salanio says—"Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the
devil cross my prayers."

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

   Of the devils mentioned by Shakespeare may be mentioned the
following—

   *Amaimon* is one of the chief, whose dominion is on the north side of
the infernal gulf. He might be bound or restrained from doing hurt from
the third hour till noon, and from the ninth hour till evening. In the
"Merry Wives of Windsor" (ii. 2) Ford mentions this devil, and in "1
Henry IV." (ii. 4) Falstaff says—"that same mad fellow of the north,
Percy; and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the bastinado and made Lucifer
cuckold." <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_86.md)

   The north was always supposed to be the particular habitation of bad
spirits. Milton, therefore, assembles the rebel angels in the north. In
"1 Henry VI." (v. 3), La Pucelle invokes the aid of the spirits—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Under the lordly monarch of the north."</span>

</div>

   *Barbason*. This demon would seem to be the same as "Marbas, alias
Barbas," who, as Scot <span id="fr_87"></span>[2](#fn_87.md) informs us,
"is a great president, and appeareth in the forme of a mightie lion; but
at the commandment of a conjurer cometh up in the likeness of man, and
answereth fullie as touching anything which is hidden or secret." In the
"Merry Wives of Windsor" (ii. 2) it is mentioned by Ford in connection
with Lucifer, and again in "Henry V." (ii. 1) Nym tells Pistol—"I am not
Barbason, you cannot conjure me."

   The names of the several fiends in "King Lear," Shakespeare is
supposed to have derived from Harsnet's "Declaration of Egregious Popish
Impostures" (1603).

   *Flibbertiggibet*, one of the fiends that possessed poor Tom, is, we
are told (iv 1.), the "fiend of mopping and mowing, who possesses
chambermaids and waiting-women." And again (iii. 4), "he begins at
curfew and walks till the first cock; he gives men the pin and the web."

   *Frateretto* is referred to by Edgar (iii. 6). "Frateretto calls me;
and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness. Pray, innocent,
and beware the foul fiend."

   *Hobbididance* is noticed as "prince of darkness" (iv. 1),

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

and perhaps is the same as Hopdance (iii. 6), "who cries," says Edgar,
"in Tom's belly for two white herring."

   *Mahu*, like Modo, would seem to be another name for "the prince of
darkness" (iii. 4), and further on (iv. i) he is spoken of as the fiend
"of stealing;" whereas the latter is described as the fiend "of murder."
Harsnet thus speaks of them:—"Maho was general dictator of hell; and
yet, for good manner's sake, he was contented of his good nature to make
show, that himself was under the check of Modu, the graund devil in
Ma(ister) Maynie."

   *Obidicut*, another name of the fiend known as Haberdicut (iv. 1).

   *Smulkin* (iii. 4). This is spelt Smolkin by Harsnet.

   Thus, in a masterly manner, Shakespeare has illustrated and
embellished his plays with references to the demonology of the period;
having been careful in every case—whilst enlivening his audience—to
convince them of the utter absurdity of this degraded form of
superstition.
