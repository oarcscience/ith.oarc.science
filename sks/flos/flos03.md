# FOLK-LORE OF SHAKESPEARE.

### CHAPTER I.

#### FAIRIES.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> wealth of Shakespeare's luxuriant
imagination and glowing language seems to have been poured forth in the
graphic accounts which he has given us of the fairy tribe. Indeed, the
profusion of poetic imagery with which he has so richly clad his fairy
characters is unrivalled, and the "Midsummer Night's Dream" holds a
unique position in so far as it contains the finest modern artistic
realisation of the fairy kingdom. Mr Dowden in his Shakspere Primer
(1877, pp. 71, 72) justly remarks:—"As the two extremes of exquisite
delicacy, of dainty elegance, and, on the other hand, of thick-witted
grossness and clumsiness, stand the fairy tribe, and the group of
Athenian handicraftsmen. The world of the poet's dream includes the
two—a Titania, and a Bottom the weaver—and can bring them into grotesque
conjunction. No such fairy poetry existed anywhere in English literature
before Shakspere. The tiny elves, to whom a cowslip is tall, for whom
the third part of a minute is an important division of time, have a
miniature perfection which is charming. They delight in all beautiful
and dainty things, and war with things that creep and things that fly,
if they be un-comely; their lives are gay with fine frolic and delicate
revelry." Puck, the jester of fairyland, stands apart from the rest, the
recognisable "lob of spirits," a rough, "fawn-faced, shock-pated little
fellow, dainty-limbed shapes around him." Judging, then, from the
elaborate account which the poet has bequeathed us of the fairies, it is
evident that

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

the subject was one in which he took a special interest. Indeed, the
graphic pictures he has handed down to us of—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and
groves;  
 And ye, that on the sands with printless foot,  
 Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him  
 When he comes back; you demy-puppets that  
 By moonshine do the green-sour ringlets make  
 Whereof the ewe not bites," &c.,</span>

</div>

show how intimately he was acquainted with the history of these little
people, and what a complete knowledge he possessed of the superstitious
fancies which had clustered round them. In Shakespeare's day, too, it
must be remembered, fairies were much in fashion; and, as Johnson
remarks, common tradition had made them familiar. It has also been
observed that well acquainted, from the rural habits of his early life,
with the notions of the peasantry respecting these beings, he saw that
they were capable of being applied to a production of a species of the
wonderful. Hence, as Mr Halliwell Phillipps <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) has so aptly written, "he founded his elfin
world on the prettiest of the people's traditions, and has clothed it in
the ever-living flowers of his own exuberant fancy." Referring to the
fairy mythology in the "Midsummer Night's Dream," it is described by Mr
Keightley <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) as an attempt to blend "the
elves of the village with the fays of romance. His fairies agree with
the former in their diminutive stature—diminished, indeed, to dimensions
inappreciable by village gossips—in their fondness for dancing, their
love of cleanliness, and their child-abstracting propensities. Like the
fays, they form a community, ruled over by the princely Oberon and the
fair Titania. There is a court and chivalry; Oberon would have the
queen's sweet changeling to be a "knight of his train to trace the
forest wild." Like earthly monarchs, he has his jester, "the shrewd and
knavish sprite called Robin Goodfellow."

   Of the fairy characters mentioned by Shakespeare may be

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

mentioned Oberon, king of fairyland, and Titania his queen. They are
represented as keeping rival courts in consequence of a quarrel, the
cause of which is thus told by Puck ("Midsummer Night's Dream," ii. I):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The king doth keep his revels here to-night:  
 Take heed the queen come not within his sight;  
 For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,  
 Because that she as her attendant hath  
 A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;  
 She never had so sweet a changeling;  
 And jealous Oberon would have the child  
 Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;  
 But she perforce withholds the loved boy,  
 Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy;  
 And now they never meet in grove or green,  
 By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen," &c.</span>

</div>

   Oberon first appears in the old French romance of "Huon de
Bourdeaux," and is identical with Elberich, the dwarf king of the German
story of Otnit in the Heldenbuch. The name Elberich, or, as it appears
in the "Nibelungenlied," Albrich, was changed, in passing into French,
first into Auberich, then into Auberon, and finally became our Oberon.
He is introduced by Spenser in the "Fairy Queen" (Book ii., cant. i.,
st. 6), where he describes Sir Guyon:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Well could he tournay, and in lists debate,  
 And knighthood tooke of good Sir Huon's hand,  
 When with King Oberon he came to faery land."</span>

</div>

And in the 10th canto of the same book (stanza 75) he is the allegorical
representative of Henry VIII. The wise Elficleos left two sons,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                        "of which faire Elferon,  
The eldest brother, did untimely dy;  
Whose emptie place the mightie Oberon  
Doubly supplide, in spousall and dominion."</span>

</div>

"Oboram, King of Fayeries," is one of the characters in Greene's "James
the Fourth." <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md)

   The name Titania for the queen of the fairies appears to

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

have been the invention of Shakespeare, for, as Mr Ritson <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md) remarks, she is not "so called by any other
writer." Why, however, the poet designated her by this title, presents,
according to Mr Keightley, <span id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md) no
difficulty—"It was," he says, "the belief of those days that the fairies
were the same as the classic nymphs, the attendants of Diana. The Fairy
Queen was therefore the same as Diana whom Ovid (Met. iii. 173) styles
Titania." In Chaucer's "Merchant's Tale," Pluto is the King of Faerie,
and his queen, Proserpina, "who danced and sang about the well under the
laurel in January's garden." <span id="fr_5"></span>[3](#fn_5.md)

   In "Romeo and Juliet" (i. 4) she is known by the more familiar
appellation, Queen Mab. "I dream’d a dream tonight," says Romeo,
whereupon Mercutio replies, in that well-known famous passage—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you"</span>

</div>

—this being the earliest instance in which Mab is used to designate the
fairy queen. Mr Thoms <span id="fr_6"></span>[4](#fn_6.md) thinks that the
origin of this name is to be found in the Celtic, and that it contains a
distinct allusion to the diminutive form of the elfin sovereign. *Mab*,
both in Welsh and in the kindred dialects of Brittany, signifies a child
or infant, and hence it is a befitting epithet to one who

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                 "Comes  
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone  
On the fore-finger of an alderman."</span>

</div>

Mr Keightley suggests that Mab may be a contraction of Habundia, who,
Heywood says, ruled over the fairies; and another derivation is from
Mabel, of which Mab is an abbreviation.

   Amongst the references to Queen Mab, we may mention Drayton's
"Nymphidia"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hence Oberon, him sport to make,  
 (Their rest when weary mortals take,</span>

</div>

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"> And none but only fairies wake),  
  Descendeth for his pleasure:  
 And Mab, his merry queen, by night  
 Bestrides young folks that lie upright," etc.</span>

</div>

   Ben Jonson, in his "Entertainment of the Queen and Prince at
Althrope," in 1603, describes to come "tripping up the lawn a bevy of
fairies, attending on Mab, their Queen, who falling into an artificial
ring that there was cut in the path, began to dance around." In the same
masque the queen is thus characterised by a satyr—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This is Mab, the mistress fairy,  
 That doth nightly rob the dairy,  
 And can help or hurt the cherning  
 As she please, without discerning," &c.</span>

</div>

   Like Puck, Shakespeare has invested Queen Mab with mischievous
properties, which "identify her with the night of hag of popular
superstition," and she is represented as

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Platting the manes of horses in the night."</span>

</div>

   The merry Puck, who is so prominent an actor in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream," is the mischief-loving sprite, the jester of the fairy court,
whose characteristics are roguery and sportiveness. In his description
of him, Shakespeare, as Mr Thoms points out, "has embodied almost every
attribute with which the imagination of the people has invested the
fairy race; and has neither omitted one trait necessary to give
brilliancy and distinctness to the likeness, nor sought to heighten its
effect by the slightest exaggeration. For, carefully and elaborately as
he has finished the picture, he has not in it invested the "Lob of
Spirits" with one gift or quality which the popular voice of the age was
not unanimous in bestowing upon him." Thus (ii. 1) the fairy says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Either I mistake your shape and making quite,  
 Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite  
 Call’d Robin Goodfellow: are you not he  
 That frights the maidens of the villagery;  
 Skim milk; and sometimes labour in the quern</span>

</div>

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"> And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;  
 And sometimes make the drink to bear no barm;  
 Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?  
 Those that Hobgoblin call you and Sweet Puck,  
 You do their work, and they shall have good luck:  
 Are you not he?"</span>

</div>

   The name "Puck" was formerly applied to the whole race of fairies,
and not to any individual sprite—puck, or pouke, being an old word for
devil, in which sense it is used in the Vision of Piers Ploughman—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Out of the poukes pondfold  
 No maynprise may us feeche."</span>

</div>

The Icelandic *puki* is the same word, and in Friesland and Jutland the
domestic spirit is called Puk by the peasantry. In Devonshire, Piskey is
the name for a fairy, with which we may compare the Cornish Pixey. In
Worcestershire, too, we read how the peasantry are occasionally
"poake-ledden," that is, misled by a mischievous spirit called *poake*.
And, according to Grose's "Provincial Glossary," in Hampshire they give
the name of Colt-pixey to a supposed spirit or fairy, which, in the
shape of a horse, neighs, and misleads horses into bogs. The Irish,
again, have their Pooka, <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) and the Welsh
their Pwcca—both words derived from Pouke or Puck. Mr Keightley <span
id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8.md) thinks, also, that the Scottish *pawkey*,
sly, knowing, may belong to the same list of words. It is evident, then,
that the term Puck was in bygone years extensively applied to the
fairy-race, an appellation still found in the west of England. Referring
to its use in Wales, there is a Welsh tradition to the effect that
Shakespeare received his knowledge of the Cambrian fairies from his
friend Richard Price, son of Sir John Price, of the Priory of Brecon. It
is even claimed that Cwm Pwcca, or Puck Valley, a part of the romantic
glen of the Clydach, in Breconshire, is the original scene of the
"Midsummer Night's Dream." <span id="fr_9"></span>[3](#fn_9.md)

   Another of Puck's names was Robin Goodfellow, and one of the most
valuable illustrations we have of the "Midsummer

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Night's Dream" is
a black-letter tract published in London, 1628, under the title of
"Robin Goodfellow: His Mad Pranks, and Merry Jests," full of honest
mirth, and is a fit medicine for melancholy." <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) Mr Halliwell Phillipps, <span
id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md) speaking of Robin Goodfellow, says, "there
can be no doubt that in the time of Shakespeare the fairies held a more
prominent position in our popular literature than can be now concluded
from the pieces on the subject that have descended to us." The author of
"Tarlton's "News out of Purgatory," printed in 1590, assures us that
Robin Goodfellow was "famosed in every old wives chronicle for his mad
merry pranks;" and we learn from Henslowe's Diary that Chettle was the
writer of a drama on the adventures of that "merry wanderer of the
night." These have disappeared; and time has dealt so harshly with the
memory of poor Robin, that we might almost imagine his spirit was still
leading us astray over massive volumes of antiquity in a delusive search
after documents for ever lost; or rather, perhaps, it is his punishment
for the useless journeys he has given our ancestors, misleading
night-wanderers, "and laughing at their harm." <span
id="fr_12"></span>[3](#fn_12.md) He is mentioned by Drayton in his
"Nymphidia"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"He meeteth Puck, which most men call  
 Hob-goblin, and on him doth fall," &c.</span>

</div>

"hob being the familiar or diminutive form of Robert and Robin, so that
Hobgoblin is equivalent to Robin the Goblin, *i.e.*, Robin
Goodfellow." <span id="fr_13"></span>[4](#fn_13.md) Burton, in his "Anatomy
of Melancholy," alludes to him thus, "A bigger kinde there is of them,
called with us hobgoblins and Robin Goodfellows, that would, in
superstitious times grinde corne for a mess of milk, cut wood, or do any
manner of drudgery work." Under his name of Robin Goodfellow, Puck is
well characterized in Jonson's "Masque of Love Restored." <span
id="fr_14"></span>[5](#fn_14.md)

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

   Another epithet applied to Puck is "Lob," as in the "Midsummer
Night's Dream" (ii. 1), where he is addressed by the fairy as—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou Lob of spirits." <span
id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md)</span>

</div>

With this we may compare the "lubber-fiend" of Milton, and the following
in Beaumont and Fletcher's "Knight of the Burning Pestle (iii. 4):"
"There is a pretty tale of a witch that had the devil's mark about her,
that had a giant to be her son, that was called Lob-lye-by-the-Fire."
Grimm <span id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md) mentions a spirit, named the
"Good Lubber," to whom the bones of animals used to be offered at
Manseld in Germany. Once more, the phrase of "being in," or "getting
into Lob's pound," is easy of explanation, presuming Lob to be a fairy
epithet—the term being equivalent to Poake-ledden or Pixy-led. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[3](#fn_17.md) In "Hudibras," this term is employed as a
name for the stocks in which the knight puts Crowdero—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Crowdero, whom in irons bound,  
 Thou basely threw’st into Lob's pound."</span>

</div>

   It occurs, also, in Massinger's "Duke of Milan" (iii. 2), where it
means behind the arras."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Who forc’d the gentleman, to save her credit,  
 To marry her, and say he was the party  
 Found in Lob's pound."</span>

</div>

   The allusion by Shakespeare to the "Will-o’-the-Wisp," where he
speaks of Puck as "sometime a fire," is noticed elsewhere, this being
one of the forms under which this fairy was supposed to play his
midnight pranks.

   Referring, in the next place, to the several names of Shakespeare's
fairies, we may quote from "The Merry Wives of Windsor" (iv. 3), where
Mrs Page speaks of "urchins, ouphes, and fairies"—urchin having been an
appellation for one class of fairies. In the "Maydes Metamorphosis" of
Lylie (1600), we find fairies, elves, and urchins

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

separately accommodated with dances for their use. The following is the
*urchin's* dance:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By the moone we sport and play,  
 With the night begins our day;  
 As we frisk the dew doth fall,  
 Trip it, little urchins all, Lightly as the little bee,  
 Two by two, and three by three,  
 And about goe wee, goe wee."</span>

</div>

   In the "Tempest" (i. 2), their actions are also limited to the night.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                     "Urchins  
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,  
All exercise on thee."</span>

</div>

   The children employed to torment Falstaff in "Merry Wives of Windsor"
(iv. 4), were to be dressed in these fairy shapes.

   Mr Douce regards the word urchin, when used to designate a fairy, of
Celtic origin, with which view Mr Thoms <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md) compares the *urisks* of Highland fairies.

   The term "ouphe," according to Grimm, is only another form of the
cognate *elf*, which corresponds with the Middle High German ulf, in the
plural *ulve*. He further proves the identity of this *ulp* with *alp*,
and with our English elf, from a Swedish song published by Asdwiddson,
in his "Collection of Swedish Ballads," in one version of which the
elfin king is called Herr *Elfver*, and in the second Herr *Ulfver*.

   The name *elf*, which is frequently used by Shakespeare, is the same
as the Anglo-Saxon alf, the old High German and the middle High German
alp. "Fairies and elvs," says Tollet, "are frequently mentioned together
in the poets without any distinction of character that I can recollect."

   The other fairies, Peas-blossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustard-seed,
probably owe their appellations to the poet himself.

   How fully Shakespeare has described the characteristics of the fairy
tribe, besides giving a detailed account of their habits and doings may
be gathered from the following pages,

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

in which we have briefly enumerated the various items of fairy lore as
scattered through the poet's writings.

   Beauty, then, united with power, was one of the popular
characteristics of the fairy tribe. Such was that of the "Fairy Queen"
of Spenser, and of Titania in "A Midsummer Night's Dream." In "Antony
and Cleopatra" (iv. 8), Antony, on seeing Cleopatra enter, says to
Scarus—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,  
 Make her thanks bless thee."</span>

</div>

In "Cymbeline" (iii. 6), when the two brothers find Imogen in their
cave, Belarius exclaims:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But that it eats our victuals, I should think  
 Here was a fairy." <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md)</span>

</div>

And he then adds—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,  
 An earthly paragon! behold diviness  
 No elder than a boy."</span>

</div>

   The fairies, as represented in many of our old legends and
folk-tales, are generally noticeable for their beauty, the same being
the case with all their surroundings. As Sir Walter Scott <span
id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md) too says, "Their pageants and court
entertainments comprehended all that the imagination could conceive of
what were accounted gallant and splendid. At their processions they
paraded more beautiful steeds than those of mere earthly parentage. The
hawks and hounds which they employed in their chase were of the first
race. At their daily banquets, the board was set forth with a splendour
which the proudest kings of the earth dared not aspire to, and the hall
of their dancers echoed to the most exquisite music."

   Mr Douce <span id="fr_21"></span>[3](#fn_21.md) quotes from the romance
of "Lancelot of the Lake," where the author, speaking of the days of
King Arthur, says, "En celui temps estoient appellees faees toutes
selles qui sentre-mettoient denchantemens et de charmes, et moult en
estoit pour lors principalement en la Grande Bretaigne, et savoient la
force et la vertu des paroles, des pierres,

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

et des herbes, parquoy elles estoient tenues en jeunesse et en beaulte,
et en grandes richesses comme elles devisoient."

   "This perpetual youth and beauty," he adds, "cannot well be separated
from a state of immortality;" another characteristic ascribed to the
fairy race. It is probably alluded to by Titania in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" (ii. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The human mortals want their winter here."</span>

</div>

And further on (ii. 1), when speaking of the changeling's mother, she
says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But she, being mortal, of that boy did die."</span>

</div>

Again, a fairy addresses Bottom the weaver (iii. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hail, Mortal!"</span>

</div>

—an indication that she was not so herself. The very fact, indeed, that
fairies "call themselves *spirits*, ghosts, or shadows, seems to be a
proof of their immortality." Thus Puck styles Oberon "king of shadows,"
and this monarch asserts of himself and his subjects—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But we are spirits of another sort."</span>

</div>

   Fletcher in the "Faithful Shepherdess" describes (i. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A virtuous well, about whose flow’ry banks  
 The nimble-footed fairies dance their rounds,  
 By the pale moon-shine, dipping oftentimes  
 Their stolen children, so to make them free  
 From dying flesh, and dull mortality."</span>

</div>

   Ariosto in his "Orlando Furioso" (Book xliii. stanza 98) says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am a fayrie, and to make you know,  
 To be a fayrie what it doth import,  
 We cannot dye, how old so ear we grow.  
 Of paines and harmes of ev’rie other sort  
 We taste, onelie no death we nature ow."</span>

</div>

   An important feature of the fairy race was their power of vanishing
at will, and of assuming various forms. In "A Midsummer Night's Dream,"
Oberon says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am invisible, and I will  
 Overhear their conference."</span>

</div>

Puck relates how he was in the habit of taking all kinds

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

of outlandish forms; and in the "Tempest," Shakespeare has bequeathed to
us a graphic account of Ariel's eccentricities. "Besides," says Mr
Spalding, <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) "appearing in his natural
shape, and dividing into flames, and behaving in such a manner as to
cause young Ferdinand to leap into the sea, crying, 'Hell is empty, and
all the devils are here!' he assumes the forms of a water nymph (i. 2),
a harpy (iii. 3), and also the Goddess Ceres (iv. 1), while the strange
shapes, masquers, and even the hounds that hunt and worry the would-be
king and viceroys of the island, are Ariel's 'meaner fellows." Poor
Caliban complains of Prospero's spirits (ii. 2),—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For every trifle are they set upon me;  
 Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me  
 And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which  
 Lie tumbling in my bare-foot way and mount  
 Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I  
 All wound with adders who with cloven tongues  
 Do hiss me into madness."</span>

</div>

   That fairies are sometimes exceedingly diminutive is fully shewn by
Shakespeare, who gives several instances of this peculiarity. Thus Queen
Mab in "Romeo and Juliet" to which passage we have already had occasion
to allude (i. 4) is said to come

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"In shape no bigger than an agate stone <span
id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md)  
 On the fore-finger of an alderman."</span>

</div>

And Puck tells us, in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (ii. 1), that when
Oberon and Titania meet,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"They do square, that all their elves for fear  
 Creep into acorn cups, and hide them there."</span>

</div>

Further on (ii. 2) the duties imposed by Titania upon her train point to
their tiny character—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;  
 Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;</span>

</div>

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"> Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,  
 Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,  
 To make my small elves coats."</span>

</div>

And when enamoured of Bottom, she directs her elves that they should—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;  
 Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,  
 With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;  
 The honey bags steal from the humble bees,  
 And for night tapers crop their waxen thighs  
 And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,  
 To have my love to bed and to arise  
 And pluck the wings from painted butterflies  
 To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes."</span>

</div>

We may compare, too, Ariel's well-known song in the "Tempest" (v. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">    "Where the bee sucks, there suck I:  
     In a cowslip's bell I lie;  
     There I couch when owls do cry,  
     On the bat's back I do fly  
     After summer merrily,  
 Merrily, merrily shall I live now  
 Under the blossom that hangs on the bough."</span>

</div>

   Again, from the following passage in the "Merry Wives of Windsor"
(iv. 4) where Mrs Page, after conferring with her husband, suggests
that—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nan Page my daughter and my little son  
 And three or four more of their growth we'll dress  
 Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green, and white,  
 With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,  
 And rattles in their hands."</span>

</div>

it is evident that in Shakespeare's day fairies were supposed to be of
the size of children. The notion of their diminutiveness, too, it
appears was not confined to this country, <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) but existed in Denmark, <span
id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25.md) for in the ballad of Eline of Villenskov
we read—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Out then spake the smallest Trold;  
   No bigger than an ant;—  
 Oh! here is come a christian man,  
   His schemes I'll sure prevent."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

   Again, various stories are current in Germany descriptive of the
fairy dwarfs; one of the most noted being that relating to Elberich, who
aided the emperor Otnit to gain the daughter of the Paynim Soldan of
Syria. <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md)

   The haunts of the fairies on earth are generally supposed to be the
most romantic and rural that can be selected; such a spot being the
place of Titania's repose described by Oberon in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" (ii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A bank where the wild thyme blows,  
 Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,  
 Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,  
 With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:  
 There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,  
 Lull’d in these flowers with dances and delight;  
 And there the snake throws her enamell’d skin,  
 Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in."</span>

</div>

Titania also tells how the fairy race meet—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"On hill, in dale, forest or mead,  
 By paved fountain, or by rushy brook,  
 Or in the beached margent of the sea."</span>

</div>

   In the "Tempest" (v. 1), we have the following beautiful invocation
by Prospero:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and
groves,  
 And ye, that on the sands with printless foot,  
 Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him  
 When he comes back—"</span>

</div>

Their haunts, however, varied in different localities, but their
favourite abode was in the interior of conical green hills, on the
slopes of which they danced by moonlight. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_27)\* Milton in the "Paradise Lost" (Book i..md)
speaks of—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "Fairy elves,  
Whose midnight revels, by a forest side  
Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,  
Or dreams he sees, while overhead the moon  
Sits arbitress, and nearer to the earth  
Wheels her pale course, they, on their mirth and dance  
Intent, with jocund music charm his ear;  
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

   The Irish fairies occasionally inhabited the ancient burial-places
known as tumuli or barrows, whilst some of the Scottish fairies took up
their abode under the "door-stane" or threshold of some particular
house, to the inmates of which they administered good offices. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md)

   The so-called fairy-rings in old pastures <span
id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29.md)—little circles of a brighter green, within
which it is supposed the fairies dance by night—are now known to result
from the outspreading propagation of a particular mushroom, the
fairy-ringed fungus, by which the ground is manured for a richer
following vegetation. An immense deal of legendary lore, however, has
clustered round this curious phenomenon, popular superstition
attributing it to the merry roundelays of the moonlight fairies <span
id="fr_30"></span>[3](#fn_30). In the "Tempest" (v. 1.md) Prospero invokes
the fairies as the "demi-puppets" that

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By moonshine do the green-sour ringlets make,  
 Whereof the ewe not bites; and you, whose pastime  
 Is to make midnight mushrooms."</span>

</div>

   In "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (ii. 1), the fairy says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I do wander everywhere,  
 Swifter than the moon's sphere;  
 And I serve the fairy queen,  
 To dew her orbs upon the green."</span>

</div>

   Again in the "Merry Wives of Windsor" (v. 5), Mistress Quickly says

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And nightly, meadow-fairies, look, you sing  
 Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring;  
 The expressure that it bears, green let it be,  
 More fertile-fresh than all the field to see."</span>

</div>

And once in "Macbeth" (v. 1), Hecate says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Like elves and fairies in a ring."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

   Drayton in his "Nymphidia" (1. 69–72) mentions this superstition:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And in their courses make that round,  
 In meadows and in marshes found,  
 Of them so called the fayrie ground,  
 Of which they have the keeping."</span>

</div>

   Cowley, too, in his "Complaint," says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Where once such fairies dance, no grass does ever
grow."</span>

</div>

And again, in his ode upon Dr Harvey—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And dance, like fairies, a fantastic round."</span>

</div>

   Pluquet in his "Contes Populaires de Bayeux," tells us that the fairy
rings, called by the peasants of Normandy "Cercles des Fées," are said
to be the work of fairies.

   Amongst the numerous superstitions which have clustered round the
fairy rings, we are told that when damsels of old gathered the May dew
on the grass, which they made use of to improve their complexions, they
left undisturbed such of it as they perceived on the fairy-rings,
apprehensive that the fairies should in revenge destroy their beauty.
Nor was it considered safe to put the foot within the rings, lest they
should be liable to the fairies’ power. <span
id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31) The "Athenian Oracle" (i. 397.md) mentions a
popular belief that "if a house be built upon the ground where fairy
rings are, whoever shall inhabit therein does wonderfully prosper."

   Speaking of their dress, we are told that they constantly wore green
vests, unless they had some reason for changing their attire. <span
id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32)\* In the "Merry Wives of Windsor" (iv. 4.md)
they are spoken of as:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and
white."</span>

</div>

And further on (v. 4):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Fairies, black, grey, green, and white."</span>

</div>

   The fairies of the moors were often clad in heathbrown or lichen-dyed
garments, whence the epithet of "Elfingrey."

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

   The legends of most countries are unanimous in ascribing to the
fairies an inordinate love of music; such harmonious sounds as those
which Caliban depicts in the "Tempest" (iii. 2) being generally ascribed
to them:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "The isle is full of noises,  
 Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.  
 Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments  
 Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices  
 That, if I then had waked after long sleep,  
 Will make me sleep again."</span>

</div>

   In the "Midsummer Night's Dream" (ii. 3), when Titania is desirous of
taking a nap, she says to her attendants:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Come, now a roundel, and a fairy song."</span>

</div>

   And further on (iii. 1) she tells Bottom:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,  
 And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,  
 And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep."</span>

</div>

   The author of "Round About Our Coal Fire" <span
id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) tells us that "they had fine musick always
among themselves, and danced in a moonshiny night, around, or in, a
ring."

   They were equally fond of dancing, and we are told how they meet—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"To dance their ringlets to the whistling
wind;"</span>

</div>

and in the "Maydes’ Metamorphosis" of Lylie, the fairies, as they dance,
sing—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Round about, round about, in a fine ring a,  
 Thus we dance, thus we dance, and thus we sing a  
 Trip and go, to and fro, over this green a,  
 All about, in and out, for our brave queen a," &c.</span>

</div>

   As Mr Thorns says in his "Three Notelets on Shakespeare" (1865. pp.
40–1), "the writings of Shakespeare abound in graphic notices of these
fairy revels, couched in the highest strains of poetry; and a comparison
of these with some of the popular legends which the industry of
Continental antiquaries has preserved, will show us clearly that these
delightful sketches of elfin enjoyment, have been drawn by a hand as
faithful as it is masterly."

   It would seem that the fairies disliked irreligious people, and so in
"Merry Wives of Windsor" (v. 5), the mock fairies

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

are said to chastise unchaste persons, and those who do not say their
prayers. This coincides with what Lilly in his "Life and Times" says:
"Fairies love a strict diet and upright life; fervent prayers unto God
conduce much to the assistance of those who are curious hereways,"
*i.e.*, who wish to cultivate an acquaintance with them.

   Again, fairies are generally represented as great lovers and patrons
of cleanliness and propriety, for the observance of which they were
frequently said to reward good servants, by dropping money into their
shoes in the night; and on the other hand, they were reported to punish
most severely the sluts and slovenly, by pinching them black and
blue. <span id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) Thus, in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" (v. i.), Puck says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am sent with broom before,  
 To sweep the dust behind the door."</span>

</div>

   In "Merry Wives of Windsor" (v. 5), Pistol, speaking of the mock
fairy queen, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery."</span>

</div>

and the fairies who haunt the towers of Windsor are enjoined:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "—About, about,*  
 *Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:*  
 *Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:  
   \*              \*            \*            \*  
 The several chairs of order look you scour  
 With juice of balm and every precious flower."</span>

</div>

In Ben Jonson's ballad of "Robin Goodfellow," <span
id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35.md) we have a further illustration of this
notion

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When house or hearth doth sluttish lie,  
   I pinch the maidens black and blue,  
 The bed clothes from the bed pull I,  
   And lay them naked all to view.  
            ’Twixt sleep and wake  
            I do them take,  
 And on the key-cold floor them throw;  
            If out they cry,  
            Then forth I fly,  
 And loudly laugh I, ho, ho, ho!"</span>

</div>

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In "Round about
our Coal Fire," we find the following passage bearing on the
subject:—"When the master and mistress were laid on the pillows, the men
and maids, if they had a game at romps, and blundered up stairs, or
jumbled a chair, the next morning every one would swear ’twas the
fairies, and that they heard them stamping up and down stairs all night,
crying 'Waters lock’d, waters lock’d!' when there was no water in every
pail in the kitchen." Herrick, too, in his "Hesperides" speaks of this
superstition:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If ye will with Mab find grace,  
 Set each platter in his place;  
 Rake the fire up and set  
 Water in, ere sun be set,  
 Wash your pales and cleanse your dairies,  
 Sluts are loathesome to the fairies:  
 Sweep your house; who doth not so,  
 Mab will pinch her by the toe."</span>

</div>

   While the belief in the power of fairies existed, they were supposed
to perform much good service to mankind. Thus in "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" (v. 1), Oberon says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"With this field-dew consecrate,  
 Every fairy take his gait;  
 And each several chamber bless,  
 Through this palace, with secret peace;  
 And the owner of it blest  
 Ever shall in safety rest."</span>

</div>

the object of their blessing being to bring peace upon the house of
Theseus. Mr Douce <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) remarks, that the
great influence which the belief in fairies had on the popular mind,
"gave so much offence to the holy monks and friars, that they determined
to exert all their power to expel these imaginary beings from the minds
of the people, by taking the office of the fairies’ benedictions
entirely into their own hands, a proof of which we have in Chaucer's
"Wife of Bath":—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I speke of many hundred yeres ago;  
 But now can no man see non elves mo,  
 For now the grete charitee and prayeres  
 Of limitoures and other holy freres</span>

</div>

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"> That serchen every land and every streme,  
 As thikke as motes in the sonne beme,  
 Blissing halles, chambres, kichenes, and boures,  
 Citees and burghes, castles highe and toures,  
 Thropes and bernes, shepenes and dairies,  
 This maketh that ther ben no faeries:  
 For ther as wont to walken was an elf  
 Ther walketh now the limitour himself."</span>

</div>

Macbeth, too, (v. 8) in his encounter with Macduff, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I bear a charmed life, which must not yield  
 To one of woman born."</span>

</div>

   In the days of chivalry, the champion's arms were ceremoniously
blessed, each taking an oath that he used no charmed weapon. In
Spenser's "Faerie Queene" (Book i., canto 4) we read:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">            "He bears a charmed shield,  
And eke enchanted arms, that none can pierce."</span>

</div>

   Fairies were amazingly expeditious in their journeys. Thus, Puck goes
"swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow," and he answers Oberon in "A
Midsummer Night's Dream," who was about to send him on a secret
expedition:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll put a girdle round about the earth  
 In forty minutes."</span>

</div>

Again, the same fairy addresses him—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Fairy king, attend, and mark:  
 I do hear the morning lark."  
   *Oberon*. Then, my queen, in silence sad,  
 Trip we after the night's shade:  
 We the globe can compass soon,  
 Swifter than the wandering moon."</span>

</div>

Once more, Puck says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,  
 For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,  
 And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger," &c.</span>

</div>

   It was fatal, if we may believe Falstaff in "Merry Wives of Windsor"
(v. 5), to speak to a fairy—"They are fairies; he that speaks to them
shall die."

   Fairies are accustomed to enrich their favourites; and in "A Winter's
Tale" (iii. 3) the shepherd says:—"It was told

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

me I should be rich by the fairies; " <span
id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37) and in "Cymbeline" (v. 4.md), Posthumous, on
waking and finding the mysterious paper, exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare
one!  
 Be not, as in our fangled world, a garment  
 Nobler than that it covers," &c.</span>

</div>

   At the same time, however, it was unlucky to reveal their acts of
generosity, as the shepherd further tells us—"This is fairy gold, boy;
and ’twill prove so; up with’t, keep it close, home, home, the next way.
We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy."

   The necessity of secrecy in fairy transactions of this kind is
illustrated in Massinger and Field's play of the "Fatal Dowry," 1632
(iv. 1), <span id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38.md) where Romont says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But not a word o’ it; ’tis fairies’ treasure,  
 Which, but reveal’d, brings on the blabber's ruin."</span>

</div>

   Amongst the many other good qualities belonging to the fairy tribe,
we are told that they were humanely attentive to the youthful
dead. <span id="fr_39"></span>[3](#fn_39.md) Thus Guiderius in "Cymbeline,"
thinking that Imogen is dead (iv. 2), says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,  
 And worms will not come to thee;" <span
id="fr_40"></span>[4](#fn_40.md)</span>

</div>

there having been a popular notion that where fairies resorted no
noxious creature could be found.

   In the pathetic dirge of Collins a similar allusion is made—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"No wither’d witch shall here be seen,  
   No goblin lead their nightly crew;  
 The female fays shall haunt the green  
   And dress thy grave with pearly dew."</span>

</div>

It seems, however, that they were also supposed to be malignant; but
this, "it may be," says Mr Ritson, "was merely calumny, as being utterly
inconsistent with their general

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

character, which was singularly innocent and amiable." Thus when Imogen,
in "Cymbeline" (ii. 2), prays on going to sleep—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"From fairies and the tempters of the night,  
 Guard me, beseech ye," <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md)</span>

</div>

it must have been, says Mr Ritson, <span id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md)
the *incubus* she was so afraid of.

   Hamlet too notices this imputed malignity of the fairies (i. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "Then no planet strikes,  
Nor fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm." <span
id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_43.md)</span>

</div>

   That the fairies, however, were fond of indulging in mischievous
sport at the expense of mortals is beyond all doubt, the merry pranks of
Puck or Robin Goodfellow fully illustrating this item of our fairy-lore.
Thus, in "A Midsummer's Night's Dream" (ii. 1), this playful fairy says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am that merry wanderer of the night.  
 I jest to Oberon and make him smile  
 When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,  
 Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:  
 And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,  
 In very likeness of a roasted crab,  
 And when she drinks, against her lips I bob  
 And on her wither’d dewlap pour the ale.  
 The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,  
 Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;  
 Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,  
 And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough."</span>

</div>

A fairy, in another passage, asks Robin

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Are you not he  
That frights the maidens of the villagery,  
        \*        \*        \*        \*  
Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm."</span>

</div>

   We have already mentioned how Queen Mab had the same

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

mischievous humour in her composition, which is described by Mercutio in
"Romeo and Juliet" (i. 4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                    "This is that very Mab  
 That plats the manes of horses in the night,  
 And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,  
 Which once untangled much misfortune bodes."</span>

</div>

   Another reprehensible practice attributed to the fairies was that of
carrying off and exchanging children, such being designated
changelings. <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md) The special agent in
transactions of the sort was also Queen Mab, and hence Mercutio says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"She is the fairies’ midwife."</span>

</div>

And "she is so called," says Mr Halliwell-Phillipps, "because it was her
supposed custom to steal new-born babes in the night and leave others in
their place." Mr Steevens gives a different interpretation to this line,
and says, "It does not mean that she was the midwife to the fairies but
that she was the person among the fairies whose department it was to
deliver the fancies of sleeping men in their dreams, those children of
an idle brain."

metaphorically for a very diminutive person, in allusion to the small
figures cut in agate for rings. In 2 Henry IV. (i. 2) Falstaff says:—"I
was never manned with an agate till now; but I will inset you neither in
gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your
master, for a jewel." In "Much Ado About Nothing" (iii. 1) Hero speaks
of a man as being "low, an agate very vilely cut."
