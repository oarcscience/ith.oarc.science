### CHAPTER II.

#### WITCHES.

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> years gone by witchcraft was one of
the grossest forms of superstition, and it would be difficult to
estimate the extent of its influence in this and other countries. It is
not surprising that Shakespeare should have made frequent allusions to
this popular belief, considering how extensively it prevailed in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; the religious and dramatic
literature of the period being full of it. Indeed, as Mr Williams <span
id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45) points out, "what the vulgar superstition
must have been may be easily conceived, when men of the greatest genius
or learning credited the possibility, and not only a theoretical but
possible occurrence, of these infernal phenomena." Thus Francis Bacon
was "not able to get rid of the principles upon which the creed was
based. Sir Edward Coke, his contemporary, the most acute lawyer of the
age, ventured even to define the devil's agents in witchcraft. Sir
Thomas Browne and Sir Matthew Hale, in 1664, proved their faith, the one
by his solemn testimony in open court, the other by his still more
solemn sentence." Hence, it was only to be expected that Shakespeare
should introduce into his writings descriptions of a creed which held
such a prominent place in the history of his day, and which has made
itself famous for all time by the thousands of victims it caused to be
sent to the torture-chamber, to the stake, and to the scaffold. Thus he
has given a graphic account of the celebrated Jeanne D’Arc, the Maid of
Orleans, in 1 Henry VI., although Mr Dowden <span
id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_46) is of opinion that this play was written
by one or

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

more authors, Greene having had perhaps a chief hand in it, assisted by
Peele and Marlowe. He says, "It is a happiness not to have to ascribe to
our greatest poet the crude and hateful handling of the character of
Joan of Arc, excused though to some extent it may be by the occurrence
of view in our old English chronicles."

   Mr Lecky, <span id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47) too, regards the
conception of Joan of Arc given in I Henry VI. as "the darkest blot upon
the poet's genius," but it must be remembered that we only have
expressed the current belief of his day—the English vulgar having
regarded her as a sorceress, the French as an inspired heroine. Talbot
is represented as accusing her of being a witch, serving the Evil One,
and entering Rouen by means of her sorceries (iii. 2).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy
tears,  
 If Talbot but survive thy treachery.  
 Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress,  
 Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,  
 That hardly we escaped the pride of France."</span>

</div>

   Further on (v. 3) she is made to summon fiends before her, but she
wishes them in vain, for they speak not, hanging their heads in sign of
approaching disaster.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Now help, ye charming spells and periapts;  
 And ye choice spirits that admonish me  
 And give me signs of future accidents.  
 You speedy helpers, that are substitutes  
 Under the lordly monarch of the north,  
 Appear and aid me in this enterprise."</span>

</div>

But she adds—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"See, they forsake me! now the time is come  
 That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest  
 And let her head fall into England's lap.  
 My ancient incantations are too weak,  
 And hell too strong for me to buckle with:  
 Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust."</span>

</div>

   Finally, convicted of practising sorcery, and filling "the world with
vicious qualities," she was condemned to be burnt. Her death, however,
Sir Walter Scott <span id="fr_48"></span>[2](#fn_48) says, "was not, we

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

are sorry to say, a sacrifice to superstitious fear of witchcraft, but a
cruel instance of wicked policy, mingled with national jealousy and
hatred. The Duke of Bedford, when the ill-starred Jeanne fell into his
hands, took away her life in order to stigmatise her memory with
sorcery, and to destroy the reputation she had acquired among the
French."

   The cases of the Duchess of Gloucester and of Jane Shore, also
immortalised by Shakespeare, are both referred to in the succeeding
pages.

   The witch of Brentford, mentioned by Mrs Page in "The Merry Wives of
Windsor" (iv. 2), was an actual personage, the fame, says
Staunton, <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49) "of whose vaticinations
must have been traditionally well known to an audience of the time,
although the records we possess of her are scant enough. The chief of
them is a black letter tract, printed. by William Copland in the middle
of the sixteenth century, entitled "Jyl of Braintford's Testament," from
which it appears she was hostess of a tavern at Brentford. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_50) One of the characters in Dekker and
Webster's "Westward Ho" <span id="fr_51"></span>[3](#fn_51) says, "I
doubt that old hag, Gillian of Brainford has bewitched me."

   The witches in "Macbeth" are probably Scottish hags. As Mr Gunnyon
remarks, <span id="fr_52"></span>[4](#fn_52) "They are hellish monsters,
brewing hell-broth, having cats and toads for familiars, loving
midnight, riding on the passing storm, and devising evil against such as
offend them. They crouch beneath the gibbet of the murderer, meet in
gloomy caverns, amid earthquake convulsions, or in thunder, lightning,
and rain." Coleridge, speaking of them, observes that "the weird sisters
are as true a creation of Shakespeare's as his Ariel and Caliban—fates,
fairies, and materialising witches being the elements. They are wholly
different from any representation of witches in the contemporary
writers, and yet presented a sufficient external resemblance to the
creatures of vulgar prejudice to act

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

immediately on the audience. Their character consists in the imaginative
disconnected from the good, they are the shadowy obscure and fearfully
anomalous of physical nature, elemental avengers without sex or kin."

   It has been urged, however, by certain modern critics, that these
three sisters, "who play such an important part in 'Macbeth' are not
witches at all, but are, or are intimately allied to, the Norns or Fates
of Scandinavian paganism." <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53) Thus, a
writer in the *Academy* (Feb. 8th, 1879) thinks that Shakespeare drew
upon Scandinavian mythology for a portion of the material he used in
constructing these characters, and that he derived the rest from the
traditions of contemporary witchcraft; in fact, that the "sisters" are
hybrids between Norns and witches. The supposed proof of this is that
each sister exercises the special function of one of the Norns. "The
third," it is said, "is the special prophetess, whilst the first takes
cognizance of the past, and the second of the present, in affairs
connected with humanity. These are the tasks of Urda, Verdandi, and
Skulda. The first begins by asking, "When shall we three meet again?"
The second decides the time: "When the battle's lost and won." The
third, the future prophecies: "That will be ere the set of sun." The
first again asks, "Where?" The second decides: "Upon the heath." The
third, the future prophesies: "There to meet with Macbeth."

   It is further added, that the description of the sisters given by
Banquo (i. 3) applies to Norns rather than witches—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What are these  
 So wither’d and so wild in their attire,  
 That look not like the inhabitants o’ the earth,  
 And yet are on’t? Live you? or are you aught  
 That man may question? You seem to understand me,  
 By each at once her chappy finger laying  
 Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,  
 And yet your beards forbid me to interpret  
 That you are so."</span>

</div>

But, as Mr Spalding truly adds, "a more accurate poetical counterpart to
the prose descriptions given by contemporary writers, of the appearance
of the poor creatures who were

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

charged with the crime of witchcraft could hardly have been penned."
Scot, for instance, in his "Discoverie of Witchcraft" (Book I. chap.
iii. 7), says—"They are women which commonly be old, lame, bleare-eied,
pale, fowle, and full of wrinkles; they are leane and deformed, showing
melancholie in their faces." Harsnet, too, in his "Declaration of Popish
Impostures" (1603, 136), speaks of a witch as "an old weather-beaten
crone, having her chin and knees meeting for age, walking like a bow,
leaning on a staff, hollow-eyed, un-toothed, furrowed, having her limbs
trembling with palsy, going mumbling in the streets; one that hath
forgotten her paternoster, yet hath a shrewd tongue to call a drab a
drab."

   The beard, also, to which Shakespeare refers in the passage above,
was the recognised characteristic of the witch. Thus, in the "Honest
Man's Fortune" (ii. 1), it is said, "The women that come to us for
disguises must wear beards, and that's to say a token of a witch." In
the "Merry Wives of Windsor" (iv. 2), Sir Hugh Evans says of the
disguised Falstaff—"By yea and no, I think the ’oman is a witch indeed:
I like not when a ’oman has a great peard; I spy a great peard under his
muffler."

   introduction of Hecate among the witches in "Macbeth" (iii. 5),
Shakespeare has been censured for confounding ancient with modern
superstitions. But the incongruity is found in all the poets of the
Renaissance. Hecate, of course, is only another name for Diana.
"Witchcraft, in truth, is no modern invention. Witches were believed in
by the vulgar in the time of Horace as implicitly as in the time of
Shakespeare. And the belief that the Pagan gods were really existent as
evil demons is one which has [come](errata.htm#0) down from the very
earliest ages of Christianity." <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54) As
far back as the fourth century, the Council of Ancyra is said to have
condemned the pretensions of witches; that in the night-time they rode
abroad, or feasted with their mistress, who was one of the

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pagan goddesses,
Minerva, Sibylla, or Diana, or else Herodias. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55) In Middleton's "Witch," Hecate is the name
of one of his witches, and she has a son a low buffoon. In Jonson's "Sad
Shepherd" (ii. 1) Maudlin the witch calls Hecate the mistress of
witches, "Our dame Hecate." Whilst speaking of the witches in "Macbeth,"
it may be pointed out that <span id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56) "the full
meaning of the 1st scene is the fag-end of a witch's Sabbath, which, if
fully represented, would bear a strong resemblance to the scene at the
commencement of the 4th Act. But a long scene on such a subject would be
tedious and uninteresting at the commencement of the play. The audience
is therefore left to assume that the witches have met, performed their
conjurations, obtained from the evil spirits the information concerning
Macbeth's career that they desired to obtain, and perhaps have been
commanded by the fiends to perform the mission they subsequently carry
through." Brand <span id="fr_57"></span>[3](#fn_57) describes this
"Sabbath of the witches as a meeting to which the sisterhood, after
having been anointed with certain magical ointments, provided by their
infernal leader, are supposed to be carried through the air on brooms,"
&c. It was supposed to be held on a Saturday, and in past centuries this
piece of superstition was most extensively credited, and was one of the
leading doctrines associated with the system of witchcraft.

   Referring, in the next place, to the numerous scattered notices of
witches given by Shakespeare throughout his plays, it is evident that he
had made himself thoroughly acquainted with the superstitions connected
with the subject, many of which he has described with the most minute
accuracy. It appears, then, that although they were supposed to possess
extraordinary powers, which they exerted in various ways, yet these were
limited, as in the case of Christmas night, when we are told in "Hamlet"
(i. 1), "they have no power to charm." In spite, too, of their being
able to

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

assume the form of any animal at pleasure, the tail was always wanting.
In "Macbeth" (i. 3), the first witch says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And, like a rat without a tail, I'll do, I'll do,
and I'll do."</span>

</div>

One distinctive mark, also, of a werwolf, or human being changed into a
wolf, was the absence of a tail. The cat was said to be the form most
commonly assumed by the familiar spirits of witches; as, for instance,
where the first witch says, "I come, Graymalkin!" <span
id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58) (i. 1), and further on (iv. i), "Thrice
the brinded cat hath mew’d." In German legends and traditions, we find
frequent notice of witches, assuming the form of a cat, and displaying
their fiendish character in certain diabolical acts. It was, however,
the absence of the tail that only too often was the cause of the witch
being detected in her disguised form. There were various other modes of
detecting witches; one being "the trial by the stool," to which an
[allusion](errata.htm#1) is made in "Troilus and Cressida" (ii. 1),
where Ajax says to Thersites—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou stool for a witch!"</span>

</div>

—a practice which is thus explained in Grey's *Notes* (ii. 236), "In one
way of trying a witch, they used to place her upon a chair or a stool,
with her legs tied cross, that all the weight of her body might rest
upon her seat, and by that means, after some time, the circulation of
the blood would be much stopped, and her sitting would be as painful as
the wooden horse; and she must continue in this pain twenty-four hours,
without either sleep or meat; and it was no wonder that, when they were
tired out with such an ungodly trial, they would confess themselves many
times guilty to free themselves from such torture."

   Again, it was a part of the system of witchcraft that drawing blood
from a witch rendered her enchantments ineffectual. Thus in 1 Henry VI.
(i. 5) Talbot says to the Pucelle de Orleans—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">          "I'll have a bout with thee;  
 Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee:  
 Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> An instance of
this superstition occurred some years ago in a Cornish village, when a
man was summoned before the bench of magistrates and fined for having
assaulted the plaintiff and scratched her with a pin. Indeed, this
notion has by no means died out. As recently as the year 1870, a man
eighty years of age was fined at Barnstaple, in Devonshire, for
scratching with a needle the arm of a young girl. He pleaded that he had
"suffered affliction" through her for five years, had had four
complaints on him at once, had lost fourteen canaries, and about fifty
goldfinches, and that his neighbours told him this was the only way to
break the spell and get out of her power." <span
id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59)

It was, also, a popular belief that a great share of faith was a
protection from witchcraft. Hence, in the "Comedy of Errors" (iii. 2.),
Dromio of Syracuse says of Nell—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If my breast had not been made of faith and my
heart of steel,  
 She had transform’d me to a curtal-dog, and made me turn i’ the
wheel."</span>

</div>

In order, moreover, to check the power of witches, it was supposed to be
necessary to propitiate them, a ceremony which was often performed. It
is alluded to further on in the same play (iv. 3), where Dromio of
Syracuse says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,  
 A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,  
 A nut, a cherry-stone,"</span>

</div>

and in "Macbeth" we read of their being propitiated by gifts of blood.
Witches were supposed to have the power of creating storms and other
atmospheric disturbances—a notion to which much prominence is given in
"Macbeth." Thus the witches elect to meet in thunder, lightning, or
rain. They are represented as being able to loose and bind the winds (v.
3), to cause vessels to be tempest-tossed at sea. Hence Macbeth
addresses them (iv. i)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Though you untie the winds and let them fight  
 Against the churches; though the yesty waves  
 Confound and swallow navigation up;  
 Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;  
 Though castles topple on their warders’ heads;</span>

</div>

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"> Though palaces and pyramids do slope  
 Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure  
 Of nature's germens tumble all together,  
 Even till destruction sicken."</span>

</div>

Thus, by way of illustration we may quote a curious confession made in
Scotland, about the year 1591, by Agnes Sampson, a reputed witch. She
vowed that at the time his Majesty (James VI.) was in Denmark, she took
a cat and christened it, and afterwards bound to each part of that cat
the chiefest parts of a dead man, and several joints of his body; and
that in the night following, the said cat was conveyed into the midst of
the sea, by herself and other witches, sailing in their riddles, or
crieves, and so left the said cat right before the town of Leith, in
Scotland. This done, there arose such a tempest in the sea, as a greater
hath not been seen, which tempest was the cause of the perishing of a
boat or vessel coming from the town of Brunt Island to the town of
Leith, wherein were sundry jewels and rich gifts, which should have been
presented to the new Queen of Scotland at his Majesty's coming to Leith.
Again, it is confessed that the said christened cat was the cause of the
king's majesty's ship, at his coming forth of Denmark, having a contrary
wind to the rest of the ships then being in his company, which thing was
most strange and true, as the king's majesty acknowledged.” It is to
this circumstance that Shakespeare probably alludes in "Macbeth" (i. 3),
where he makes the witch say—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Though his bark cannot be lost,  
 Yet it shall be tempest-tost."</span>

</div>

Witches were also believed to be able to sell or give winds, a notion
thus described in Drayton's "Moon-Calf" (865)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"She could sell winds to any one that would  
 Buy them for money, forcing them to hold  
 What time she listed, tie them in a thread,  
 Which ever as the seafarer undid  
 They rose or scantled, as his sails would drive  
 To the same port whereas he would arrive."</span>

</div>

So in "Macbeth" (i. 3)—

"2 Witch. I'll give thee a wind.  
 1 Witch. Thou’rt kind.  
 3 Witch. And I another.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Singer quotes from
Sumner's "Last Will and Testament"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"In Ireland, and in Denmark both,  
 Witches for gold will sell a man a wind,  
 Which, in the corner of a napkin wrapp’d,  
 Shall blow him safe unto what coast he will."</span>

</div>

   At one time the Finlanders and Laplanders drove a profitable trade by
the sale of winds. After being paid they knitted three magical knots,
and told the buyer that when he untied the first he would have a good
gale; when the second, a strong wind; and when the third, a severe
tempest. <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60)

   The sieve, as a symbol of the clouds, has been regarded amongst all
nations of the Aryan stock as the mythical vehicle used by witches,
nightmares, and other elfish beings in their excursions over land and
sea. <span id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_61) Thus the first witch in
"Macbeth" (i. 3), referring to the scoff which she had received from a
sailor's wife, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o’ the
Tiger:  
 But in a sieve I'll thither sail." <span
id="fr_62"></span>[3](#fn_62)</span>

</div>

   Stories of voyages performed in this way are common enough in
Germany. A man, for instance, going through a corn-field, finds a sieve
on the path, which he takes with him. He does not go far before a young
lady hurries after him, and hunts up and down as if looking for
something, ejaculating all the time, "How my children are crying in
England!" Thereupon the man lays down the sieve, and has hardly done so
ere sieve and lady vanish. In the case of another damsel of the same
species, mentioned by Mr Kelly, the usual exclamation is thus varied—"My
sieve rim! my sieve rim! how my mother is calling me in England!" At the
sound of her mother's voice the daughter immediately thinks of her
sieve. Steevens quotes from the Life of Doctor Fian, "a notable
sorcerer," burnt at Edinburgh, January 1591, how

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

that he and a number of witches went to sea, "each one in a *riddle* or
*cive*." In the "Discovery of Witchcraft," Reginald Scot says it was
believed that "witches could sail in an egg shell, a cockle or muscle
shell, through and under the tempestuous seas." Thus, in "Pericles" (iv.
4), Gower says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make
short;  
 Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for’t."</span>

</div>

Their dance is thus noticed in "Macbeth" (iv. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll charm the air to give a sound  
 While you perform your dutie round."</span>

</div>

   Witches also were supposed to have the power of vanishing at will, a
notion referred to in "Macbeth" (i. 3), where, in reply to Banquo's
inquiry as to whither the witches are vanished, Macbeth replies—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Into the air; and what seem’d corporal melted  
 As breath into the wind."</span>

</div>

In his letter to his wife he likewise observes—"They made themselves
air, into which they vanished." Hecate, in the third Act (scene 5),
after giving instructions to the weird host, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am for the air; this night I'll spend  
 Unto a dismal and a fatal end."</span>

</div>

   To this purpose they prepared various ointments, concerning which
Reginald Scot <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63) says—"The devil
teacheth them to make ointment of the bowels and members of children,
whereby they ride in the air and accomplish all their desires. After
burial they steal them out of their graves and seethe them in a cauldron
till the flesh be made potable, of which they make an ointment by which
they ride in the air." Lord Bacon also informs us that the "ointment the
witches use is reported to be made of the fat of children digged out of
their graves, of the juices of smallage, wolfbane, and cinquefoil,
mingled with the meal of fine wheat; but I suppose the soporiferous
medicines are likest to do it, which are—henbane, hemlock, mandrake,
moonshade—or, rather, nightshade—tobacco, opium, saffron," <span
id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64) &c. These witch recipes, which are very

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

numerous, are well illustrated in Shakespeare's grim cauldron scene. In
"Macbeth" (iv. 1), where the first witch speaks of—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Grease that's sweaten  
 From the murderer's gibbet."</span>

</div>

we may compare a similar notion given by Apuleius, who, in describing
the process used by the witch, Milo's wife, for transforming herself
into a bird, says—"That she cut the lumps of flesh of such as were
hanged." <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65)

   Another way by which witches exercise their power was by looking into
futurity, as in "Macbeth" (i. 3), where Banquo says to them—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If you can look into the seeds of time,  
 And say which grain will grow and which will not,  
 Speak then to me."</span>

</div>

   Charles Knight, in his biography of Shakespeare, quotes a witch-trial
which aptly illustrates the passage above; the case being that of
Johnnet Wischert, who was "indicted for passing to the green-growing
corn in May, twenty-two years since, or thereby, sitting thereupon
tymous in the morning before the sun-rising; and being there found and
demanded what she was doing, thou answered, I shall tell thee; I have
been piling the blades of the corn. I find it will be a dear year; the
blade of the corn grows withersones \[contrary to the course of the
sun\], and when it grows sonegatis about \[with the course of the sun\],
it will he a good, cheap year."

   According to a common notion firmly believed in days gone by, witches
were supposed to make waxen figures of those they intended to harm,
which they stuck through with pins, or melted before a slow fire. Then,
as the figure wasted, so the person it represented was said to waste
away also. Thus in "Macbeth" (i. 3), the First Witch says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Weary se’nnights nine times nine,  
 Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine."</span>

</div>

   Referring to the histories of the Duchess of Gloucester and of Jane
Shore, who were accused of practising this mode

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

of witchcraft, Shakespeare, in "2 Henry VI." (i. 2), makes the former
address Hume thus—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What say’st thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr’d  
 With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,  
 With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?  
 And will they undertake to do me good?"</span>

</div>

She was afterwards, however, accused of consulting witches concerning
the mode of compassing the death of her husband's nephew, Henry VI. It
was asserted that "there was found in the possession of herself and
accomplices a waxen image of the king, which they melted in a magical
manner before a slow fire, with the intention of making Henry's force
and vigour waste away by like insensible degrees."

   A similar charge was brought against Jane Shore, the mistress of
Edward IV., by Richard, Duke of Gloucester. Thus in "King Richard III."
(iii. 4), Gloucester asks Hastings—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I pray you all, tell me what they deserve  
 That do conspire my death with devilish plots  
 Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail’d  
 Upon my body with their hellish charms?"</span>

</div>

And he then further adds—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"See how I am bewitch’d; behold mine arm  
 Is, like a blasted sapling, wither’d up:  
 And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,  
 Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,  
 That by their witchcraft thus have marked me."</span>

</div>

   This superstition is further alluded to in "King John" (v. 4) by
Melun, who, wounded, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Have I not hideous death within my view,  
 Retaining but a quantity of life,  
 Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax  
 Resolveth from his figure ’gainst the fire?"</span>

</div>

And again, in "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" (ii. 4), Proteus says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For now my love is thaw’d;  
 Which, like a waxen image ’gainst a fire,  
 Bears no impression of the thing it was." <span
id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66)</span>

</div>

   Images were frequently formed of other materials, and maltreated in
some form or other, to produce similar results—

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

a piece of superstition which still prevails to a great extent in the
East. Dubois, in his "People of India" (1825), speaks of magicians who
make small images in mud or clay, and then write the names of their
animosity on the breasts thereof these are otherwise pierced with thorns
or mutilated, "so as to communicate a corresponding injury to the person
represented." They were also said to extract moisture from the body, as
in "Macbeth" (i. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I will drain him dry as hay."</span>

</div>

   Referring to the other mischievous acts of witches, Steevens quotes
the following from "A Detection of Damnable Driftes Practised by Three
Witches," &c., arraigned at Chelmisforde, in Essex, 1579:—"Item,—Also
she came on a tyme to the house of one Robert Lathburie, who, dislyking
her dealyng, sent her home emptie; but presently after her departure his
hogges fell sicke and died, to the number of twentie." Hence in
"Macbeth" (i. 3) in reply to the inquiry of the First Witch—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Where hast thou been, sister?"</span>

</div>

the second replies—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Killing swine."</span>

</div>

   It appears to have been their practice to destroy the cattle of their
neighbours, and the farmers have to this day many ceremonies to secure
their cows and other cattle from witchcraft; but they seem to have been
most suspected of malice against swine. Harsnet observes, how, formerly,
"A sow could not be ill of the measles, nor a girl of the sullens, but
some old woman was charged with witchcraft." <span
id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67)

   Mr Henderson, in his "Folk-Lore of the Northern Counties" (1879, p.
182), relates how a few years ago a witch died in the village of Bovey
Tracey, Devonshire. She was accused of "overlooking" her neighbours'
pigs, so that her son, if ever betrayed into a quarrel with her, used
always to say before they parted—"Mother, mother, spare my pigs."

   Multiples of three and nine were specially employed by witches,
ancient and modern. Thus in "Macbeth" (i. 3), the

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

witches take hold of hands and dance round in a ring nine times—three
rounds for each witch as a charm for the furtherance of her
purposes." <span id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thrice to thine and thrice to mine  
 And thrice again, to make up nine.  
 Peace! the charm's wound up."</span>

</div>

   The love of witches for odd numbers is further illustrated (iv. 1)
where one of them tells how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined."</span>

</div>

this being the witches’ way of saying four times.

   In Fairfax's "Tasso" (book xiii, stanza 6) it is said that—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Witchcraft loveth numbers odd."</span>

</div>

This notion is very old, and we may compare the following quotations
from Ovid's "Metamorphoses" (xiv. 58)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Ter novies Carmen magico demurmurat ore."</span>

</div>

And again (vii. 189–191)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Ter se convertit; ter sumptis fluorine crinem  
 Irroravit aquis; ternis ululatibus ora  
 Solvit."</span>

</div>

Virgil too in his "Eclogues" (viii. 75) says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Numero deus impare gaudet."</span>

</div>

   The belief in the luck of odd numbers is noticed by Falstaff in the
"Merry Wives of Windsor" (v. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"They say there is divinity in odd numbers, either
in nativity, chance, or death!"</span>

</div>

   In "King Lear" (iv. 2) when the Duke of Albany tells Goneril—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"She that herself will sliver and disbranch  
 From her material sap, perforce must wither  
 And come to deadly use"—</span>

</div>

he alludes to the use that witches and enchanters were commonly supposed
to make of withered branches in their charms. <span
id="fr_69"></span>[2](#fn_69)\*

   Amongst other items of witch-lore mentioned by Shakespeare, may be
noticed the common belief in the intercourse

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

between demons and witches to which Prospero alludes in the Tempest (i.
2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself  
 Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!"</span>

</div>

This notion is seriously refuted by Scot in his "Discovery of
Witchcraft" (book iv.), where he shows it to be "flat knavery."

   The offspring of a witch was termed "Hag-Seed," and as such is spoken
of by Prospero in the "Tempest" (i. 2).

   Witches were also in the habit of saying their prayers backwards; a
practice to which Hero refers in "Much ado about Nothing" (iii. 1) where
speaking of Beatrice, she says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I never yet saw man,  
 How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,  
 But she would spell him backward."</span>

</div>

   Familiar spirits <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70) attending on
magicians and witches were always impatient of confinement. <span
id="fr_71"></span>[2](#fn_71) So in the "Tempest" (i. 2) we find an
illustration of this notion in the following dialogue—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">*Prospero*. "What is’t thou canst demand?"  
*Ariel*.                              "My Liberty."  
*Prospero*. "Before the time be out? No more."</span>

</div>

   Lastly, the term "Aroint thee" ("Macbeth" i. 3) used by the first
witch, occurs again in "King Lear" (iii. 4), "Aroint thee, witch, aroint
thee." That *aroint* is equivalent to "away," "begone," seems to be
agreed, though its etymology is uncertain. <span
id="fr_72"></span>[3](#fn_72)\* "Rynt thee" is used by Milkmaids in
Cheshire to a. cow, when she has been milked, to bid her get out of the
way. Ray in his Collection of North Country Words (1768, p. 52) gives
"Rynt ye, by your leave, stand handsomly, as rynt you witch, quoth
Bessie Locket to her mother, Proverb, Chesh."

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Some connect it
with the adverb "aroume," meaning "abroad," found in Chaucer's "House of
Fame" (book ii. 32)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"That I a-roume was in the field."</span>

</div>

Other derivations are from the Latin averrunco: the Italian rogna, a
cutaneous disease, &c. <span id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73)\*

   How thoroughly Shakespeare was acquainted with the system of
witchcraft is evident from the preceding pages, in which we have noticed
his allusions to most of the prominent forms of this species of
superstition. Many other items of witch lore, however, are referred to
by him, mention of which is made in succeeding chapters.
