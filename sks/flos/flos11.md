### CHAPTER IX.

#### INSECTS AND REPTILES.

<span class="smallcaps">As</span> Dr Johnson has truly remarked,
Shakespeare is "the poet of nature," for "his attention was not confined
to the actions of men; he was an exact surveyor of the inanimate world;
his descriptions have always some peculiarity, gathered by contemplating
things as they really exist. Whether life or nature be his subject,
Shakespeare shows plainly that he has seen with his own eyes." So, too,
he was in the habit of taking minute observation of the popular notions
relating to natural history, so many of which he has introduced into his
plays—using them to no small advantage. In numerous cases, also, the
peculiarities of certain natural objects have furnished the poet with
many excellent metaphors. Thus, in "Richard II." (ii. 3), Bolingbroke
speaks of "the caterpillars of the commonweath," and in "2 Henry VI."
(iii. 1), the Duke of York's reflection on the destruction of his hopes,
is—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud,  
 And caterpillars eat my leaves away—"</span>

</div>

their destructive powers being familiar.

   *Ant*.—An ancient name for the ant is "Pismire," probably a Danish
word, from *paid* and *myre*, signifying such ants as live in hillocks.
In "1 Henry IV.," (I. 3), Hotspur says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Why, look you, I am whipp’d and scourged with
rods,  
 Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear  
 Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke."</span>

</div>

   *Blue-bottle*.—This well-known insect has often been used as a term
of reproach. Thus, in "2 Henry IV.," (v. 4), it furnishes an epithet
applied by the abusive tongue of Doll Tearsheet, to the beadle who had
her in custody. She reviles

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

him as a "blue-bottle rogue," a term, says Mr Patterson, <span
id="fr_573"></span>[1](#fn_571.md) "evidently suggested by the similarity
of the colours of his costume to that of the insect."

   *Bots*.—Our ancestors imagined that poverty or improper food
engendered these worms, or that they were the offspring of putrefaction.
In "1 King Henry IV.," (ii. 1), one of the carriers says:—"Peas and
beans are as dank here as a dog, and that is the next way to give poor
jades the bots." And one of the misfortunes of the miserable nag of
Petruchio is, ("Taming of the Shrew," iii. 2), "that he is so begnawn
with the bots."

   *Cricket*—The presence of crickets in a house has generally been
regarded as a good omen, and said to prognosticate cheerfulness and
plenty. Thus, Poins, in answer to the Prince's question in "1 Henry
IV.," (ii. 4), "Shall we be merry?" replies, "As merry as crickets." By
many of our poets the cricket has been connected with cheerfulness and
mirth. Thus, in Milton, "il Penseroso" desires to be—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Far from all resort of mirth,  
 Save the cricket on the hearth."</span>

</div>

   It has not always, however, been regarded in the same light, for Gay,
in his "Pastoral Dirge," among the rural prognostications of death,
gives the following:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And shrilling crickets in the chimney
cry’d."</span>

</div>

   And in Dryden's "Œdipus" occurs the subjoined:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Owls, ravens, crickets, seem the watch of
death."</span>

</div>

   Lady Macbeth, also, (ii. 2), in replying to the question of her
husband after the murder of Duncan, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I heard the owl scream and the crickets
cry."</span>

</div>

   In "Cymbeline," too, (ii. 2), when Iachimo, at midnight, commences
his survey of the chamber where Imogen lies sleeping, his first words
refer to the chirping of crickets, rendered all the more audible by the
repose which at that moment prevailed throughout the palace:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The crickets sing, and man's o’er labour’d sense  
 Repairs itself by rest."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

   Gilbert White, in his "History of Selborne," (1853, p. 174), remarks
that "it is the housewife's barometer, foretelling her when it will
remain; and is prognostic sometimes, she thinks, of ill or good luck, of
the death of a near relation, or the approach of an absent lover. By
being the constant companion of her solitary home, it naturally becomes
the object of her superstition." <span id="fr_574"></span>[1](#fn_572.md)

   Its supposed keen sense of hearing is referred to in the "Winter's
Tale," (ii. 1), by Mamillius, who, on being asked by Hermione to tell a
tale, replies:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">           "I will tell it softly;  
Yond crickets shall not hear it."</span>

</div>

   *Frog*.—In the "Two Noble Kinsmen," the gaoler's daughter (iii. 4),
says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Would I could find a fine frog! he would tell me  
 News from all parts o’ the world; then would I make  
 A carack of a cockle-shell, and sail  
 By east and north-east to the King of Pigmies,  
 For he tells fortunes rarely."</span>

</div>

   In days gone frogs were extensively used for the purpose of
divination. <span id="fr_575"></span>[2](#fn_573.md)\*

   *Gadfly*.—A common name for this fly is the "brize" or "breese," an
allusion to which occurs in "Troilus & Cressida," (i. 3), where Nestor,
speaking of the sufferings which cattle endure from this insect, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The herd hath more annoyance by the breese  
 Than by the tiger."</span>

</div>

   And in "Antony and Cleopatra," (iii. 9), Shakespeare makes the
excited Scarus draw a comparison between the effect which this insect
produces on a herd of cattle, and the abruptness and sudden frenzy of
Cleopatra's retreat from the naval conflict:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "You ribaudred nag of
Egypt,  
Whom leprosy o’ertake! i’ the midst o’ the fight,  
When vantage like a pair of twins appear’d  
Both the same, or rather ours the elder,  
The breese upon her, like a cow in June,  
Hoists sails and flies."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

   It is said that the terror this insect causes in cattle proceeds
solely from the alarm occasioned by "a peculiar sound it emits while
hovering for the purpose of oviposition." <span
id="fr_576"></span>[1](#fn_574.md)

   *Lady-bird*.—This is used in "Romeo and Juliet" (i. 3), as a term of
endearment. Lady Capulet having inquired after her daughter Juliet, the
nurse replies:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I bade her come. What, lamb! What, lady-bird!  
 God forbid! Where's this girl! What, Juliet!"</span>

</div>

Mr Staunton regards this passage as an exquisite touch of nature. "The
old nurse," he says, in her fond garrulity uses 'lady-bird' as a term of
endearment; but recollecting its application to a female of loose
manners, checks herself—'God forbid!' her darling should prove such a
one." Mr Dyce, <span id="fr_577"></span>[2](#fn_575.md) however, considers
this explanation incorrect, and gives the subjoined note:—"The nurse
says that she has already bid Juliet come"; she then calls out, "What,
lamb! What, lady-bird!" and Juliet not yet making her appearance, she
exclaims, "God forbid! Where's this girl?" The words, "God forbid,"
being properly an ellipsis of "God forbid that any accident should keep
her away," but used here merely as an expression of impatience."

   *Lizard*.—It was a common superstition in the time of Shakespeare
that lizards were venomous, a notion which probably originated in their
singular form. Hence the lizard's leg was thought a suitable ingredient
for the witches’ cauldron in "Macbeth" (iv. 1). Suffolk in "2 Henry VI."
(iii. 2), refers to this idea:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!  
 Their softest touch as smart as lizards’ stings."</span>

</div>

Again in "3 Henry VI." (ii. 2.) Queen Margaret speaks of—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Venom toads, or lizards’ dreadful stings."</span>

</div>

In "Troilus and Cressida" (v. 1), it is classed with the toad and the
owl.

   *Moth*.—This term, as Mr Patterson remarks in his "Insects mentioned
in Shakespeare's Plays" (1841, p. 164), does not

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

awaken many pleasing associations. In the minds of most people it stands
for an insect either contemptible from its size and inertness, or
positively obnoxious from its attacks on many articles of clothing. Thus
Shakespeare, he says, employs the expression "moth" to denote something
trifling or extremely minute. <span id="fr_578"></span>[1](#fn_576.md)\*
And in "King John" (iv. 1), we have the touching appeal of Prince Arthur
to Hubert, in which for mote he would substitute moth:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Arthur*. Is there no remedy?  
 *Hubert*. None but to lose your eyes.  
 *Arthur*. O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,  
           A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,  
           Any annoyance in that precious sense!  
           Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,  
           Your vile intent must needs seem horrible"</span>

</div>

in "Henry V." (iv. 1).

In these two passages, however, the correct reading is probably "mote."

   *Serpent*.—A term used by our old writers to signify a serpent was "a
worm," which is still found in the north of England in the same sense.
It is used several times by Shakespeare, as for instance, in "Measure
for Measure" (iii. 1), where the Duke, addressing Claudio, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">               "Thou’rt by no means valiant;  
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork  
Of a poor worm."</span>

</div>

This passage also illustrates an error very prevalent in days gone by
that the forked tongue of the serpent tribe was their instrument of
offence; without any thought of the teeth or fangs which are its real
weapons. <span id="fr_579"></span>[2](#fn_577.md) Again, the "blind-worm"
or "slow-worm"—a little snake with very small eyes, falsely supposed to
be venomous—is spoken of in "A Mid-summer Night's Dream" (ii. 2), in
that charming passage where the fairies are represented as singing to
their Queen Titania:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"You spotted snakes with double tongue,  
 Thorn y hedgehogs, be not seen;</span>

</div>

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span> Newts and blind-worms do no wrong,  
   Come not near our fairy queen."</span>

</div>

   In "Macbeth" (iv. 1) one of the ingredients of the witches’ cauldron
is—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting."</span>

</div>

To quote a further allusion from "Timon of Athens" (iv. 3), Shakespeare
speaks of—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The gilded newt and eyeless venomed worm."</span>

</div>

Massinger employs the same term in his "Parliament of Love" (iv. 2)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "The sad father  
That sees his son stung by a snake to death,  
May, with some justice, stay his vengeful hand,  
And let the worm escape, than you vouchsafe him  
A minute to repent." <span id="fr_580"></span>[1](#fn_578.md)</span>

</div>

   There was an old notion that the serpent caused death without pain, a
popular fancy which Shakespeare has introduced in his "Antony and
Cleopatra" (v. 2):

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,  
 That kills and pains not?"</span>

</div>

   The term "worm" was also occasionally used to signify a . "poor
creature," as also was the word "snake." Thus, in the "Taming of the
Shrew" (v. 2), Katharina says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Come, come, you froward and unable worms!  
 My mind hath been as big as one of yours,  
 My heart as great, my reason haply more."</span>

</div>

So, in "As you Like it" (iv. 3), Rosalind uses snake in the sense of
reproach:—"Well, go your way to her, for I see love hath made thee a
tame snake."

   The serpent, as the emblem of ingratitude, is alluded to by King Lear
(ii. 4), who, referring to his daughter, says how she—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">          "Struck me with her tongue,  
Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:  
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall  
On her ingrateful top!"</span>

</div>

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

   According to a popular belief, still credited, a poisonous bite could
be cured by the blood of the viper which darted the poison. Thus, in
"King Richard II." (i. 1), Mowbray says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am disgraced, impeached, and baffled here,  
 Pierced to the soul with slander's venom’d spear,  
 The which no balm can cure but his heart blood  
 Which breathed this poison."</span>

</div>

   In Cornwall it is still believed that the dead body of a serpent
bruised on the wound it has occasioned, is an infallible remedy for its
bite. <span id="fr_581"></span>[1](#fn_579.md) Hence has originated the
following rhyme:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The beauteous adder hath a sting,  
 Yet bears a balsam too."</span>

</div>

   The old notion that the snake, in the casting of its slough or skin
annually, is supposed to regain new vigour and fresh youth, is alluded
to by King Henry ("King Henry V.," iv. 1), who speaks of "With casted
slough and fresh legerity"—legerity meaning lightness, nimbleness. In
"Twelfth Night" (ii. 5), in the letter which Malvolio finds, there is
this passage:—"To inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy
humble slough and appear fresh." One of the most useful miracles which
St Patrick is reported to have performed was his driving the venomous
reptiles out of Ireland and forbidding them to return. This tradition is
probably alluded to by King Richard (ii. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                "Now for our Irish wars:  
We must supplant these rough rug-headed kerns;  
Which live like venom where no venom else,  
But only they have privilege to live."</span>

</div>

The way, we are told, by which the Saint performed this astounding feat
of his supernatural power, was by means of a drum. Even spiders, too,
runs the legend, were included in this summary process of
excommunicating the serpent race. One of the customs, therefore,
observed on St Patrick's day is visiting Croagh Patrick. This sacred
hill is situated in the county of Mayo, and is said to have been the
spot

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

chosen by St Patrick for banishing the serpents and other noxious
animals into the sea.

   In "Julius Cæsar" (ii. 1), where Brutus says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;  
 And that craves wary walking,"</span>

</div>

we may compare the popular adage—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"March wind  
Wakes the ether (*i.e.* adder) and blooms the whin." <span
id="fr_582"></span>[1](#fn_580.md)</span>

</div>

   *Spider*.—This little creature, which in daily life is little noticed
except for its cobweb, the presence of which in a house generally
betokens neglect, has, however, an interesting history, being the
subject of many a curious legend and quaint superstition. Thus, it has
not escaped the all-pervading eye of Shakespeare, who has given us many
curious scraps of folk-lore concerning it. In days gone by the web of
the common house-spider was much in request for stopping the effusion of
blood; and hence, Bottom, in addressing one of his fairy attendants in
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" (iii. 1) says—"I shall desire you of more
acquaintance, good master Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold
with you."

   Its medicinal virtues, however, do not end here, for in Sussex <span
id="fr_583"></span>[2](#fn_581.md) it is used in cases of jaundice; many an
old doctress prescribing "a live spider rolled up in butter." It is
stated, too, that the web is narcotic, and has been administered
internally, in certain cases of fever, with success. <span
id="fr_584"></span>[3](#fn_582.md) As a remedy for ague it has been
considered most efficacious. Some years ago a lady in the South of
Ireland was celebrated far and near for her cure of this disorder. Her
remedy was a large house spider taken alive enveloped in treacle or
preserve. Of course, the parties were carefully kept in ignorance of
what the wonderful remedy was. <span id="fr_585"></span>[4](#fn_583.md)

   According to a universal belief spiders were formerly considered
highly venomous; in allusion to which notion

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> King Richard II.
(iii. 2) in saluting the "dear earth" on which he stands, after "late
tossing on the breaking seas," accosts it thus—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,  
 Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous Sense,  
 But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,  
 And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,  
 Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet,  
 Which with usurping steps do trample thee."</span>

</div>

Again Leontes in the "Winter's Tale" (ii. 1) remarks—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "There may be in the cup  
A spider steep’d."</span>

</div>

   In "Cymbeline" (iv. 2), and "Richard III." (i. 2) Shakespeare classes
it with adders and toads; and in the latter play (i. 3) when Queen
Margaret is hurling imprecations on her enemies, she is turned from her
encounter with Gloucester, by a remark made by the Queen: and while a
pitying spirit seems for a minute to supplant her rage, she addresses
her successor in these words—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!  
 Why strew’st thou sugar on that bottled spider,  
 Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?"</span>

</div>

In another part of the same play (iv. 4) the epithet "bottled" is again
applied in a similar manner by Queen Elizabeth—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou bottled spider, that foul bunch-back’d
toad!"</span>

</div>

Ritson on these two passages has the following remarks on the term
bottled spider:—"A large, bloated, glossy spider, supposed to contain
venom proportionate to its size."

   The origin of the silvery threads of gossamer which are so frequently
seen extending from bush to bush was formerly unknown. Spenser, for
instance, speaks of them as "scorched dew;" and Thomson in his "Autumn"
mentions "the filmy threads of dew evaporate," which probably, says Mr
Patterson, <span id="fr_586"></span>[1](#fn_584.md) refers to the same
object. The gossamer is now, however, known to be the production of a
minute spider. It is twice mentioned by Shakespeare; but not in
connection

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

with the little being from which it originates. One of the passages is
in "Romeo and Juliet" (ii. 6)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A lover may bestride the gossamer  
 That idles in the wanton summer air,  
 And yet not fall; so light is vanity."</span>

</div>

The other occurs in "King Lear" (iv. 6) where Edgar accosts his father,
after his supposed leap from that

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Cliff, whose high and bending head  
 Looks fearfully on the confined deep."</span>

</div>

He says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers,
air,  
 So many fathom down precipitating,  
 Thou’dst shiver’d like an egg."</span>

</div>

In each case, it is expressive of extreme lightness. Nares in his
"Glossary" (i. 378) considers that the term "gossamer" originally came
from the French *gossampine*, the cotton tree, and is equivalent to
cotton wool. He says that it also means any light downy matter, such as
the flying seeds of thistles and other plants, and in poetry is not
unfrequently used to denote the long floating cobwebs seen in fine
weather. In the above passage from "King Lear" he thinks it has the
original sense, and in the one from "Romeo and Juliet" probably the
last. Some are of opinion that the word is derived from goss, the gorse
or furze. <span id="fr_587"></span>[1](#fn_585.md) In Germany, the popular
belief attributes the manufacture of the gossamer to the dwarfs and
elves. Of King Oberon, it may be remembered, we are told—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A rich mantle he did wear,  
 Made of tinsel gossamer,  
 Bestarred over with a few  
 Diamond drops of morning dew."</span>

</div>

Hogg, too, introduces it as a vehicle fit for the fairy bands, which he
describes as—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">          —"Sailing ’mid the golden air  
In skiffs of yielding gossamer."</span>

</div>

   *Toad*.—Among the vulgar errors of Shakespeare's day was the belief
that the head of the toad contained a stone possessing

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

great medicinal virtues. In "As you Like It" (ii. 1) the Duke says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sweet are the uses of adversity,  
 Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,  
 Wears yet a precious jewel in his head."</span>

</div>

Lupton in his "One Thousand Notable Things" says that "a toadstone,
called *Crepaudina*, touching any part envenomed by the bite of a rat,
wasp, spider, or other venomous beast, ceases the pain and swelling
thereof." In the Londesborough Collection is a silver ring of the
fifteenth century, in which one of these stones is set. <span
id="fr_588"></span>[1](#fn_586.md)

   It was also generally believed that the toad was highly venomous—a
notion to which there are constant allusions in Shakespeare's Plays; as,
for example, in the above passage (ii. 1), where it is spoken of as
"ugly and venomous." In Richard III. (i. 2) Lady Anne says to
Gloucester—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Never hung poison on a fouler toad."</span>

</div>

And in another scene (i. 3) Queen Margaret speaks of "that poisonous
bunch-back’d toad."

   Once more, in "Titus Andronicus" (iv. 2) the nurse describes Queen
Tamora's babe as being "as loathsome as a toad." There is doubtless some
truth in this belief, as the following quotation from Mr Frank
Buckland's "Curiosities of Natural History" seems to show:—"Toads are
generally reported to be poisonous; and this is perfectly true to a
certain extent. Like the lizards, they have glands in their skin which
secrete a white highly acid fluid, and just behind the head are seen two
eminences like split beans; if these be pressed this acid fluid will
come out—only let the operator mind that it does not get into his eyes,
for it generally comes out with a jet. There are also other glands
dispersed through the skin. A dog will never take a toad in his mouth,
and the reason is that this glandular secretion burns his tongue and
lips. It is also poisonous to the human subject. Mr Blick, surgeon, of
Islip, Oxfordshire, tells me that a man once made a wager, when

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

half drunk in a village public-house, that he would bite a toad's head
off; he did so, but in a few hours his lips, tongue, and throat began to
swell in a most alarming way, and he was dangerously ill for some
time." <span id="fr_589"></span>[1](#fn_587.md)

   Owing to the supposed highly venomous character of the toad,
"Superstition," says Pennant, <span id="fr_590"></span>[2](#fn_588.md)
"gave it preternatural powers, and made it a principal ingredient in the
incantations of nocturnal hags." Thus in "Macbeth" (iv. 1) the witch
says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Toad that under cold stone  
 Days and nights has thirty-one,  
 Swelter’d venom sleeping got,  
 Boil thou first i’ the charmed pot."</span>

</div>

Pennant adds that this was intended "for a design of the first
consideration, that of raising and bringing before the eyes of Macbeth a
hateful second-sight of the prosperity of Banquo's line. This shows the
mighty power attributed to this animal by the dealers in the magic art."

The evil spirit, too, has been likened by one of our master bards to the
toad, as a semblance of all that is devilish and disgusting ("Paradise
Lost," iv. 800):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                "Him they found,  
Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve,  
Assaying with all his devilish art to reach  
The organs of her fancy."</span>

</div>

   In "Macbeth" (i. 1), the paddock or toad is made the name of a
familiar spirit:—

   *Wasp*.—So easily, we are told, <span id="fr_592"></span>[4](#fn_590.md)
is the wrathful temperament of this insect aroused, that extreme
irascibility can scarcely be better expressed than by the term
"waspish." It is in this sense that Shakespeare has applied the epithet,
"her waspish-headed son," in the "Tempest" (iv. 1), where

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

we are told that Cupid is resolved to be a boy outright. Again, in "As
You Like It" (iv. 3), Silvius says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I know not the contents; but, as I guess  
 By the stern brow and waspish action,  
 Which she did use as she was writing of it,  
 It bears an angry tenour."</span>

</div>

Again, in the "Taming of the Shrew" (ii. 1), Petruchio addresses his
intended spouse in language not highly complimentary:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Pet*. Come, come, you wasp; i’ faith, you are too
angry.  
 *Kath*. If I be waspish, best beware my sting.  
 *Pet*. My remedy is, then, to pluck it out."</span>

</div>

   In the celebrated scene in "Julius Cæsar" (iv. 3), in which the
reconciliation between Brutus and Cassius is effected, the word is used
in a similar sense:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,  
 When you are waspish." <span id="fr_593"></span>[1](#fn_591.md)</span>

</div>

   *Water-Fly*.—This little insect which, on a sunny day, may be seen
almost on every pool, dimpling the glassy surface of the water, is used
as a term of reproach by Shakespeare. Thus, "Hamlet" (v. 2), speaking of
Osric, asks Horatio, "Dost know this water-fly?" In "Troilus and
Cressida" (v. 1), Thersites exclaims:—"Ah, how the poor world is
pestered with such water-flies, diminutives of nature." Johnson says it
is the proper emblem of a busy trifler, because it skips up and down
upon the surface of the water, without any apparent purpose.
