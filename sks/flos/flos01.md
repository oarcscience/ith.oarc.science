*Folk-lore of Shakespeare*, by T.F. Thiselton Dyer, \[1883\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PREFACE.

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> would be difficult to overestimate the
value which must be attached to the plays of Shakespeare in connection
with the social life of the Elizabethan age. Possessed of a rich
treasury of knowledge of a most varied kind, much of which he may be
said to have picked up almost intuitively, he embellished his writings
with a choice store of illustrations descriptive of the period in which
he lived. Apart, too, from his copious references to the manners and
customs of the time, he seems to have had not only a wide knowledge of
many technical subjects, but, also, an intimate acquaintance with the
folk-lore of bygone days. How far this was the case may be gathered from
the following pages, in which are collected, and grouped together, as
far as arrangement would permit, the various subjects relating to this
interesting and popular branch of our domestic history. It only remains
for me to add that the Edition of the poet's plays made use of is the
"Globe," published by Messrs Macmillan.

T. F. THISELTON DYER.

*August*, 1883.
