### CHAPTER VIII.

#### PLANTS.

<span class="smallcaps">That</span> Shakespeare possessed an extensive
knowledge of the history and superstitions associated with flowers is
evident, from even only a slight perusal of his plays. Apart from the
extensive use which he has made of these lovely objects of nature for
the purpose of embellishing, or adding pathos to, passages here and
there; he has also, with a master hand, interwoven many a little legend
or superstition, thereby infusing an additional force into his writings.
Thus we know with what effect he has made use of the willow in
"Othello," in that touching passage where Desdemona (iv. 3),
anticipating her death, relates how her mother had a maid called
Barbara—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"She was in love, and he she lov’d, prov’d mad,  
 And did forsake her; she had a song of willow,  
 An old thing ’twas, but it express’d her fortune,  
 And she died singing it. That song, to-night,  
 Will not go from my mind."</span>

</div>

In a similar manner, Shakespeare has frequently introduced the notice of
flowers with a wonderful aptness, as in the case of poor Ophelia. Those,
however, desirous of gaining a good insight into Shakespeare's knowledge
of flowers, as illustrated by his plays, would do well to consult Mr
Ellacombe's exhaustive work on the "Plant-Lore of Shakespeare," a book
to which we are much indebted in the following pages, as also to Mr
Biesly's "Shakspere's Garden."

   *Aconite*. <span id="fr_454"></span>[1](#fn_452.md)—This plant from the
deadly virulence of its juice, which, Mr Turner says, "is of all
poysones the most hastie

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

poysone," is compared by Shakespeare to gunpowder, as [in](errata.htm#4.md)
"2 Henry IV." (iv. 4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The united vessel of their blood  
 Mingled with venom of suggestion  
 As, force perforce, the age will pour it in,  
 Shall never leak, though it do work as strong  
 As aconitum or rash gunpowder."</span>

</div>

It is probably, too, alluded to in the following passage in "Romeo and
Juliet" (v. 1), were Romeo says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                   "Let me have  
A dram of poison, such soon speeding geer  
As will disperse itself through all the veins  
That the life-weary taker may fall dead  
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath  
As violently as hasty powder fired  
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb."</span>

</div>

According to Ovid, it derived its name from growing upon rock (Metam.
vii. 419)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Quæ, quia nascuntur dura vivacia caute,  
 Agrestes aconita vocant."</span>

</div>

It is probably derived from the Greek ἀκόνιτον, without a struggle, in
allusion to the intensity of its poisonous qualities. Virgil <span
id="fr_455"></span>[1](#fn_453.md) speaks of it, and tells us "how the
aconite deceives the wretched gatherers, because often mistaken for some
harmless plant. <span id="fr_456"></span>[2](#fn_454.md) The ancients
fabled it as the invention of Hecate, <span
id="fr_457"></span>[3](#fn_455.md) who caused the plant to spring from the
foam of Cerberus, when Hercules dragged him from the gloomy regions of
Pluto. Ovid pictures the stepdame as preparing a deadly potion of
aconite, (Metam. i. I47)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Lurida terribiles miscent aconita novercœ."</span>

</div>

In hunting the ancients poisoned their arrows with this venomous plant,
as "also when following their mortal brutal trade of slaughtering their
fellow creatures. <span id="fr_458"></span>[4](#fn_456.md)\* Numerous
instances are on record of the fatal results through persons eating this

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

plant. In the "Philosophical Transactions" (1732, vol. 38), we read of a
man who was poisoned in that year, by eating some of it in a salad,
instead of celery. Dr Turner mentions the case of some Frenchmen at
Antwerp, who eating the shoots of this plant for masterwort, all died,
with the exception of two, in forty-eight hours. The aconitum is equally
pernicious to animals.

   *Anemone*.—This favourite flower of early spring is probably alluded
to in the following passage of "Venus and Adonis"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By this, the boy that by her side lay killed  
 Was melted like a vapour from her sight;  
 And in the blood that on the ground lay spill’d,  
 A purple flower sprung up chequer’d with white,  
 Resembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood  
 Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood."</span>

</div>

   According to Bion, it is said to have sprung from the tears that
Venus wept over the body of Adonis—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Alas, the Paphian! fair Adonis slain!  
 Tears plenteous as his blood she pours amain,  
 But gentle flowers are born, and bloom around,  
 From every drop that falls upon the ground  
 Where streams his blood, there blushing springs the rose,  
 And where a tear has dropp’d a wind-flower blows."</span>

</div>

Other classical writers make the anemone to be the flower of Adonis. Mr
Ellacombe, <span id="fr_459"></span>[1](#fn_457.md) says that although
Shakespeare does not actually name the anemone, yet the evidence is in
favour of this plant. The "purple colour," he adds, is no objection, for
purple in Shakespeare's time had a very wide signification, meaning
almost any bright colour, just as "purpureus" had in Latin. <span
id="fr_460"></span>[2](#fn_458.md)

   *Apple*.—Although Shakespeare has so frequently introduced the apple
into his Plays, yet he has abstained from alluding to the extensive
folk-lore associated with this favourite fruit.

   Indeed, beyond mentioning some of the popular nicknames by which the
apple was known in his day, little is said about it. The term apple was
not originally confined to the fruit now so called, but was a generic
name applied to any fruit, as

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

we still speak of the love-apple, pine-apple, &c." <span
id="fr_461"></span>[1](#fn_459) So when Shakespeare ("Sonnet" xciii..md),
makes mention of Eve's apple, he simply means that it was some fruit
that grew in Eden—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,  
 If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show."</span>

</div>

   (*a*.) The "Apple-john," called in France *deux-années* or
*deux-ans*, because it will keep two years, and considered to be in
perfection when shrivelled and withered, <span
id="fr_462"></span>[2](#fn_460.md) is evidently spoken of in "1 Henry IV."
(iii. 3) where Falstaff says—"My skin hangs about me like an old lady's
loose gown; I am withered like an old apple-john." In "2 Henry IV." (ii.
4) there is a further. allusion—"1*st Drawer*. What the devil hast thou
brought there? apple-johns? thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an
apple-john. 2*nd Drawer*. Mass, thou sayest true. The prince once set a
dish of apple johns before him, and told him there were five more Sir
Johns, and, putting off his hat, said, 'I will now take my leave of
these six dry, round, old, withered knights.'" This apple, too, is well
described by Phillips ("Cider," B. i.)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nor John Apple, whose wither’d rind, entrench’d  
 By many a furrow, aptly represents  
 Decrepid age."</span>

</div>

   In Ben Jonson's "Bartholomew Fair" (i. 1) where Little-wit encourages
Quarlus to kiss his wife, he says, "she may call you an apple-john if
you use this." "Here apple-john <span id="fr_463"></span>[3](#fn_461.md)
evidently means a procuring John, besides the allusion to the fruit so
called. <span id="fr_464"></span>[4](#fn_462.md)

   (*b*.) The "Bitter-sweet or sweeting" to which Mercutio alludes in
"Romeo and Juliet" (ii. 4)—"Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a
most sharp sauce;" was apparently a

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

favourite apple, which furnished many allusions to poets. Gower in his
"Confessio Amantis" (1554, fol. 174) speaks of it—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For all such time of love is lore  
 And like unto the bitter swete,  
 For though it thinke a man first swete,  
 He shall well felen atte laste,  
 That it is sower, and maie not laste."</span>

</div>

   The name is "now given to an apple of no great value as a table
fruit, but good as a cider apple, and for use in silk dyeing." <span
id="fr_465"></span>[1](#fn_463.md)

   (*c*.) The "Crab" roasted before the fire and put into ale was a very
favourite indulgence, especially at Christmas, in days gone by, and is
referred to in the song of winter in "Love's Labour's Lost" (v. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl  
 Then nightly sings the staring owl."</span>

</div>

The beverage thus formed was called "Lambs-wool," and generally
consisted of ale, nutmeg, sugar, toast, and roasted crabs, or apples. It
formed the ingredient of the wassail-bowl; <span
id="fr_466"></span>[2](#fn_464.md) and also of the gossip's bowl <span
id="fr_467"></span>[3](#fn_465.md) alluded to in "Midsummer Night's Dream"
(ii. 1) where Puck says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,  
 In very likeness of a roasted crab,  
 And when she drinks, against her lips I bob  
 And on her wither’d dewlap pour the ale."</span>

</div>

   In Peele's "Old Wives' Tale," it is said—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Lay a crab in the fire to roast for lamb's
wool." <span id="fr_468"></span>[4](#fn_466.md)</span>

</div>

And in Herrick's "Poems"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">  "Now crowne the bowle  
    With gentle lamb's wooll,  
Add sugar, and nutmegs, and ginger."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

   (*d*.) The "Codling," spoken of by Malvolio in "Twelfth Night," (i.
5), "Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy, as a
squash is before ’tis a peascod, or a codling when ’tis almost an
apple,"—is not the variety now so-called, but was the popular term for
an immature apple, such as would require cooking to be eaten, being
derived from "coddle," to stew or boil lightly,—hence it denoted a
boiling apple, an apple for coddling or boiling. <span
id="fr_469"></span>[1](#fn_467.md) Mr Gifford <span
id="fr_470"></span>[2](#fn_468.md) says that codling was used by our old
writers for that early state of vegetation when the fruit, after shaking
off the blossom, began to assume a globular and determinate form.

   (*e*). The "Leather Coat" was the apple generally known as "the
golden russeting." <span id="fr_471"></span>[3](#fn_469.md) Davy, in "2
Henry IV," (v. 3), says:—"There's a dish of leather coats for you."

   (*f*.) The "Pippin" was formerly a common term for an apple, to which
reference is made in "Hudibras Redivivus," (1705),—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A goldsmith telling o’er his cash,  
 A pipping-monger selling trash."</span>

</div>

   In Taylor's Workes <span id="fr_472"></span>[4](#fn_470) (1630.md), we
read:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Lord, who would take him for a pippin squire,  
 That's so bedaub’d with lace and rich attire?"</span>

</div>

Mr Ellacombe <span id="fr_473"></span>[5](#fn_471.md) says the word
"pippin" denoted an apple raised from pips and not from grafts, and "is
now, and probably was in Shakespeare's time, confined to the
bright-coloured long-keeping apples of which the golden pippin is the
type." Justice Shallow, in "2 Henry IV," (v. 3), says:—"Nay, you shall
see my orchard, where in an arbour we will eat a last year's pippin of
my own graffing."

   (*g*.) The "Pomewater" was a species of apple evidently of a juicy
nature, and hence of high esteem in Shakespeare's time, for in "Love's
Labour's Lost," (iv. 2), Holofernes says:—"The deer was, as you know,
sanguis, in blood; ripe as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel
in the ear of

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

cœlo,—the sky, the welkin, the heaven; and anon falleth like a crab on
the face of *terra*,—the soil, the land, the earth."

   Parkinson <span id="fr_474"></span>[1](#fn_472.md) tells us the
"Pomewater is an excellent, good, and great whiteish apple, full of sap
or moisture, somewhat pleasant sharp, but a little bitter withal; it
will not last long, the winter's frost soon causing it to rot and
perish.

   It appears that apples and carraways were formerly always eaten
together; and it is said that they are still served up on. particular
days at Trinity College, Cambridge. This practice is probably alluded to
by Justice Shallow in the much disputed passage in "2 Henry IV.," (iii.
5), when he speaks of eating "a last year's pippin, with a dish of
caraways." The phrase, too, seems further explained by the following
quotations from Cogan's "Haven of Health," (1599). After stating the
virtues of the seed, and some of its uses, he says:—"For the same
purpose *careway seeds* are used to be made in comfits, and to be eaten
with apples, and surely very good for that purpose, for all such things
as breed wind would be eaten with other things that break wind." Again,
in his chapter on apples, he says:—"Howbeit wee are wont to eat
carrawaies or biskets, or some other kind of comfits, or seeds together
with apples, thereby to breake winde ingendred by them, and surely this
is a verie good way for students." Mr Ellacombe, <span
id="fr_475"></span>[2](#fn_473.md) however, considers that in "the dish of
carraways" mentioned by Justice Shallow, neither caraway seeds, nor
cakes made of caraways, are meant; but the carraway or carraway-russet
apple. Most of the commentators are in favour of one of the former
explanations. Mr Dyce <span id="fr_476"></span>[3](#fn_474.md) reads
caraways in the sense of comfits or confections made with caraway-seeds,
and quotes from Shadwell's "Woman-Captain" the following:—"The fruit,
crab-apples, sweetings, and horse-plumbs; and for confections, a few
carraways in a small sawcer, as if his worship's house had been a lousie
inn."

   *Apricot*. This word, which is spelt by Shakespeare "Apricock,"

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

occurs in "Richard II.," (iii. 4), where the gardener says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,  
 Which, like unruly children, make their sire  
 Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight."</span>

</div>

And in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (iii. i), Titania gives directions:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Be kind and courteous to this gentleman,  
 Feed him with apricocks and dewberries."</span>

</div>

   The spelling "Apricock," <span id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_475.md) is
derived from the Latin *præcox*, or *præcoquus;* and it was called "the
precocious tree" because it flowered and fruited earlier than the peach.
The term "Apricock" is still in use in Northamptonshire.

   *Aspen*,—According to a mediæval legend, the perpetual motion of this
tree dates from its having supplied the wood of the Cross, and that its
leaves have trembled ever since at the recollection of their guilt. De
Quincey in his essay on "Modern Superstition" says, that this belief is
co-extensive with Christendom. The following verses, <span
id="fr_478"></span>[2](#fn_476.md) after telling how other trees were
passed by in the choice of wood for the Cross, describe the hewing down
of the aspen, and the dragging of it from the forest to Calvary—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"On the morrow stood she, trembling  
   At the awful weight she bore,  
 When the sun in midnight blackness  
   Darkened on Judea's shore.

 Still when not a breeze is stirring,  
   When the mist sleeps on the hill,  
 And all other trees are moveless  
   Stands the aspen trembling still."

</div>

   The Germans, says Mr Henderson, have a theory of their own, embodied
in a little poem, which may be thus translated:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Once, as our Saviour walked with men below,  
   His path of mercy through a forest lay;  
 And mark how all the drooping branches show,  
   What homage best a silent tree may pay.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Only the aspen stands erect and free,  
  Scorning to join that voiceless worship pure;  
 But see! He casts one look upon the tree,  
  Struck to the heart she trembles evermore!"</span>

</div>

   Another legend tells us <span id="fr_479"></span>[1](#fn_477.md) that
the aspen was said to have been the tree on which Judas hanged himself
after the betrayal of his Master, and ever since its leaves have
trembled with shame. Shakespeare twice alludes to the trembling of the
aspen. In "Titus Andronicus" (ii. 4), Marcus exclaims:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O, had the monster seen those lily hands  
 Tremble, like aspen leaves, upon the lute?"</span>

</div>

And in "2 Henry IV." (ii. 4), the hostess says:—"Feel, masters, how I
shake. Yea, in very truth, do I, an ’twere an aspen leaf."

   *Bachelor's Buttons*.—This was a name given to several flowers, and
perhaps in Shakespeare's time was more loosely applied to any flower in
bud. It is now usually understood to be a *double variety* of
ranunculus; according to others, the *Lychnis Sylvestris;* and in some
counties it is applied to the *Scabiosa Succisa*. <span
id="fr_480"></span>[2](#fn_478.md) According to Gerarde, this plant was so
called from the similitude of its flowers "to the jagged cloathe
buttons, anciently worne in this kingdome." It was formerly supposed by
country people to have some magical effect upon the fortunes of lovers.
Hence, it was customary for young people to carry its flowers in their
pockets, judging of their good or bad success, in proportion as these
retained or lost their freshness. It is to this sort of divination that
Shakespeare probably refers in "Merry Wives of Windsor" (iii. 2) where
he makes the hostess say:—"What say you to young Master Fenton? He
capers, he dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he speaks
holiday, he smells April and May; he will carry ’t, he will carry ’t;
’tis in his buttons; he will carry ’t." Mr Warter, in one of his notes
in Southey's "Common-Place Book" (1851, 4th series 244) says that this

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

practice was common in his time, in Shropshire and Staffordshire. The
term "to wear bachelor's buttons," seems to have grown into a phrase for
being unmarried. <span id="fr_481"></span>[1](#fn_479.md)

   *Balm*.—From very early times, the balm or balsam has been valued for
its curative properties, and, as such, is alluded to in "Troilus and
Cressida" (i. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,  
 Thou lay’st in every gash that love hath given me  
 The knife that made it."</span>

</div>

   In "3 Henry VI." (iv. 8) King Henry says <span
id="fr_482"></span>[2](#fn_480.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My pity hath been balm to heal their
wounds."</span>

</div>

   Alcibiades, in "Timon of Athens" (iii. 5), says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Is this the balsam, that the usuring senate  
 Pours into captains’ wounds? Banishment?"</span>

</div>

   Macbeth, too, in the well-known passage (ii. 2), introduces it—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sleep that knits up the ravell’d sleave of care,  
 The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,  
 Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,  
 Chief nourisher in life's feast."</span>

</div>

   As the oil of consecration, <span id="fr_483"></span>[3](#fn_481.md) it
is spoken of by Richard ("Richard II.," iii. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Not all the water in the rough, rude sea  
 Can wash the balm off from an anointed king."</span>

</div>

And again, in "3 Henry VI." (iii. 1), King Henry, when in disguise,
speaks thus—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thy place is filled, thy sceptre wrung from thee,  
 Thy balm wash’d off wherewith thou wast anointed.  
 No bending knee will call thee Cæsar now."</span>

</div>

   The origin of balsam, says Mr Ellacombe <span
id="fr_484"></span>[4](#fn_482.md) "was for a long time a secret, but it is
now known to have been the produce of

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

several gum-bearing trees, especially the *pistacia lentiscus* and the
*balsamodendron gileadense*, and now, as then, the name is not strictly
confined to the produce of any one plant."

   *Barley*.—The barley broth, of which the Constable in "Henry V."
(iii. 5) spoke so contemptuously as the food of English soldiers, was
probably beer, <span id="fr_485"></span>[1](#fn_483.md) which long before
the time of Henry was so celebrated that it gave its name to the plant
(barley being simply the beer-plant)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "Can sodden water,  
A drench for surrein’d jades, their barley broth,  
Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat."</span>

</div>

   *Bay-tree*.—The withering and death of this tree were reckoned a
prognostic of evil, both in ancient and modern times, a notion <span
id="fr_486"></span>[2](#fn_484.md) to which Shakespeare refers in "Richard
II." (ii. 4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"’Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.  
 The bay-trees in our country are all wither’d"</span>

</div>

—having obtained it probably from Holinshed, who says—"In this yeare, in
a manner throughout all the realme of Englande, old baie trees
withered." Lupton, in his "Syxt Booke of Notable Things," mentions this
as a bad omen—"Neyther falling-sickness, neyther devyll, wyll infest or
hurt one in that place whereas a bay-tree is. The Romaynes call it the
plant of the good angel." <span id="fr_487"></span>[3](#fn_485.md)

   *Camomile*.—It was formerly imagined that this plant grew the more
luxuriantly for being frequently trodden or pressed down; a notion
alluded to in "1 Henry IV." (ii. 4), by Falstaff—"For though the
camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster it grows, yet youth, the
more it is wasted the sooner it wears." Nares <span
id="fr_488"></span>[4](#fn_486.md) considers that the above was evidently
written in ridicule of the following passage, in a book very fashionable
in Shakespeare's day, Lyly's "Euphues," of which it is a parody—"Though
the camomile, the more it is trodden and pressed down, the more it
spreadeth; yet the violet, the

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

oftener it is handled and touched, the sooner it withereth and
decayeth," &c.

   *Clover*.—According to Johnson, the "honey-stalks" in the following
passage ("Titus Andronicus," iv. 4), are "clover-flowers, which contain
a sweet juice." It is not uncommon for cattle to overcharge themselves
with clover and die, hence the allusion by Tamora—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I will enchant the old Andronicus  
 With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,  
 Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep."</span>

</div>

   *Columbine*.—This was anciently termed "a thankless flower," and was
also emblematical of forsaken lovers. It is somewhat doubtful to what
Ophelia alludes in "Hamlet" (iv. 5), where she seems to address the
king—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"There's fennel for you, and columbines."</span>

</div>

Perhaps she regarded it as symbolical of ingratitude:

   *Crow-flowers*.—This name, which in Shakespeare's time was applied to
the "ragged robin," is now used for the buttercup. It was one of the
flowers that poor Ophelia wove into her garland ("Hamlet" iv. 7)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"There with fantastic garlands did she come  
 Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples."</span>

</div>

   *Cuckoo-buds*.—Commentators are uncertain as to what flower
Shakespeare refers in "Love's Labour's Lost," (v. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When daisies pied and violets blue  
   And lady-smocks all silver-white  
 And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue  
   Do paint the meadows with delight."</span>

</div>

   Mr Miller, in his "Gardener's Dictionary," says that the flower here
alluded to is the "Ranunculus Bulbosus"; but Mr Beisly, in his
"Shakspere's Garden," considers it to be the "Ranunculus Ficaria,"
(lesser celandine), or pile-wort, as this flower appears earlier in
spring, and is in bloom at the same time as the other flowers named in
the song. Mr Swinfen Jervis, however, in his "Dictionary of the Language
of Shakespeare" (1868), decides in favour of cowslips <span
id="fr_489"></span>[1](#fn_487.md); and

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Dr Prior suggests
the buds of the crowfoot. At the present day the nickname cuckoo-bud is
assigned to the meadow cress (cardamine pratensis).

   *Cuckoo-Flowers*.—By this flower, Mr Beisly <span
id="fr_490"></span>[1](#fn_488.md) says, the ragged robin is meant, a
well-known meadow and marsh plant, with rose-coloured flowers and
deeply-cut narrow segments. It blossoms at the time the cuckoo comes,
hence one of its names. In "King Lear," (iv. 4), Cordelia narrates how:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                      "He was met even now  
As mad as the vex’d sea—singing aloud;  
Crown’d with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,  
With burdocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,  
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow  
In our sustaining corn."</span>

</div>

   *Cypress*.—From the earliest times the cypress has had a mournful
history, being associated with funerals and churchyards, and as such is
styled by Spenser "cypress funereal."

   In Quarles's "Argalus and Parthenia," (1726, bk. iii.), a knight is
introduced whose

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Horse was black as jet, His furniture was round
about beset  
 With branches slipt from the sad cypress tree."</span>

</div>

Formerly coffins were frequently made of cypress wood, a practice to
which Shakespeare probably alludes in "Twelfth Night," (ii. 4), where
the clown says:—"In sad cypress let me be laid. Some, however,
prefer <span id="fr_491"></span>[2](#fn_489.md) understanding cypress to
mean "a shroud of cyprus or cypress,"—a fine transparent stuff, similar
to crape, either white or black, but more commonly the latter. <span
id="fr_492"></span>[3](#fn_490.md) Douce <span
id="fr_493"></span>[4](#fn_491.md) thinks that the expression "laid"

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

seems more applicable to a coffin than to a shroud, and also adds that
the shroud is afterwards expressly mentioned by itself.

   *Daffodil*.—The daffodil of Shakespeare is the wild daffodil which
grows so abundantly in many parts of England. Perdita, in "Winter's
Tale," (iv. 4), mentions a little piece of weather-lore, and tells us
how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                  "Daffodils  
That come before the swallow dares, and take  
The winds of March with beauty."</span>

</div>

   And Autolycus in the same play (iv. 3), sings thus:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When daffodils begin to peer,  
 With heigh! the doxy over the dale,  
 Why, then comes in the sweet o’ the year."</span>

</div>

   *Darnel*.—This plant, like the cockle, was used in Shakespeare's day
to denote any hurtful weed. Newton, <span
id="fr_494"></span>[1](#fn_492.md) in his "Herbal to the Bible," says that
"under the name of cockle and darnel is comprehended all vicious,
noisome, and unprofitable graine, encombring and hindering good corne."
Thus Cordelia, in "King Lear," (iv. 4), says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow  
 In our sustaining corn."</span>

</div>

   According to Gerarde, "darnel hurteth the eyes, and maketh them dim,
if it happen either in corne for breade, or drinke." Hence, it is said,
originated the old proverb, "lolio victitare,"—applied to such as were
dim-sighted. Steevens considers that Pucelle in the following passage
from "1 Henry VI.," (iii. 2), alludes to this property of the
darnel—meaning to intimate that the corn she carried with her had
produced the same effect on the guards of Rouen; otherwise they would
have seen through her disguise, and defeated her stratagem:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?  
 I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast  
 Before he'll buy again at such a rate:  
 ’Twas full of darnel: do you like the taste?"</span>

</div>

   *Date*.—This fruit of the palm-tree was once a common

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

ingredient in all kinds of pastry, and some other dishes, and often
supplied a pun for comedy, as for example, in "All's Well that End's
Well" (i. 1), where Parolles says:—"Your date is better in your pie and
your porridge, than in your cheek." And in "Troilus and Cressida" (i.
2):—"Ay, a minced man; and then to be baked with no date in the pye; for
then the man's date's out."

   *Ebony*.—The wood of this tree was regarded as the typical emblem of
darkness—the tree itself, however, was unknown in this country in
Shakespeare's time. It is mentioned in "Love's Labour's Lost" (iv. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*King* By heaven thy love is black as ebony,  
 *Biron*. Is ebony like her? O wood divine!  
        A wife of such wood were felicity."</span>

</div>

In the same play we read of "the ebon-coloured ink" (i. 1), and in
"Venus and Adonis" (948), of "Death's Ebon Dart."

   *Elder*.—This plant whilst surrounded by an extensive folklore, has
from time immemorial possessed an evil reputation, and been regarded as
one of bad omen. According to a popular tradition "Judas was hanged on
an elder,"—a superstition mentioned by Biron in "Love's Labour's Lost"
(v. 2); and also by Ben Jonson in "Every Man Out of Humour" (iv. 4)—"He
shall be your Judas, and you shall be his elder-tree to hang on." In
"Piers Plowman's Vision" (1. 593–6), we are told how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Judas, he japed  
 With jewen silver,  
 And sithen on an eller  
 Hanged hymselve."</span>

</div>

   So firmly rooted was this belief in days gone by that Sir John
Mandeville tells us in his travels, which he wrote in 1364, that he was
actually shown the identical tree at Jerusalem, "And faste by is zit,
the tree of Elder that Judas henge himself upon, for despeyr that he
hadde when he solde and betrayed oure Lord." This tradition no doubt, in
a great measure, helped to give it its bad fame; causing it to be spoken
of as "the stinking elder." Shakespeare makes

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

it an emblem of grief. In "Cymbeline" (iv. 2) Arviragus says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                      "Grow, patience!  
And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine  
His perishing root with the increasing vine."</span>

</div>

   The Dwarf Elder <span id="fr_495"></span>[1](#fn_493.md) (*Sambucus
Ebulus*) is said only to grow where blood has been shed either in battle
or in murder. The Welsh call it "Llysan gward gwyr," or "plant of the
blood of man." Shakespeare perhaps had this piece of folklore in mind
when he represents Bassianus, in "Titus and Andronicus" (ii. 4), as
killed at a pit beneath an elder tree—"This is the pit and this the
elder tree."

   *Eryngoes*.—These were formerly said to be strong pro-vocatives, and
as such are mentioned by Falstaff in "Merry Wives of Windsor" (v. 5).
"Let the sky rain potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green Sleeves,
hail kissing comfits, and snow eryngoes." Mr Ellacombe <span
id="fr_496"></span>[2](#fn_494.md) thinks that in this passage the Globe
Artichoke is meant, "which is a near ally of the Eryngium, and was a
favourite dish in Shakespeare's time."

   *Fennel*.—This was generally considered as an inflammatory herb; and
to eat "conger and fennel" was "to eat two high and hot things
together," which was an act of libertinism. <span
id="fr_497"></span>[3](#fn_495)\* Thus in "2 Henry IV." (ii. 4.md) Falstaff
says of Poins he "eats conger and fennel." Mr Beisly states <span
id="fr_498"></span>[4](#fn_496.md) that fennel was used as a sauce with
fish hard of digestion, being aromatic, and as the old writers term it,
"hot in the third degree." One of the herbs distributed by poor Ophelia
in her distraction is fennel which she offers either as a cordial or as
an emblem of flattery—"There's fennel for you, and columbine."

Mr Staunton, however, considers that fennel here signifies *lust*, while
Mr Beisly thinks its reputed property of clearing the sight is alluded
to. It is more probable that it denotes

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

flattery; especially, as in Shakespeare's time, it was regarded
emblematical of flattery. In this sense it is often quoted by old
writers. In Greene's "Quip for an Upstart Courtier," we read—"Fennell I
meane for flatterers." In "Phyala Lachrymarum" <span
id="fr_499"></span>[1](#fn_497.md) we find—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nor fennel-finkle bring for flattery,  
 Begot of his, and famed courtesie."</span>

</div>

   *Fern*.—According to a curious notion fern-seed was supposed to
possess the power of rendering persons invisible. Hence it was a most
important object of superstition, being gathered mystically, especially
on Midsummer Eve. It was believed at one time to have neither flower nor
seed; the seed, which lay on the back of the leaf, being so small as to
escape the detection of the. hasty observer. On this account, probably,
proceeding on the fantastic doctrine of signatures, our ancestors
derived the notion that those who could obtain and wear this invisible
seed would be themselves invisible; a belief which is referred to in "1
Henry IV." (ii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Gadshill*. We have the receipt of fern-seed, we
walk invisible.  
"*Chamberlain*. Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the
night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible."</span>

</div>

This superstition is mentioned by many old writers; a proof of its
popularity in times past. It is alluded to in Beaumont and Fletcher's
"Fair Maid of the Inn" (i. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Did you think that you had Gyges’ ring?  
 Or the herb that gives invisibility?"</span>

</div>

Again, in Ben Jonson's "New Inn" (i. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                        "I had  
No medicine, sir, to go invisible,  
No fern-seed in my pocket."</span>

</div>

   As recently as Addison's day, we are told in the "Tatler" (No. 240),
that "it was impossible to walk the streets without having an
advertisement thrust into your hand of a doctor

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

who had arrived at the knowledge of the green and red dragon, and had
discovered the female fern-seed." <span id="fr_500"></span>[1](#fn_498.md)

   *Fig*—Formerly the term fig served as a common expression of
contempt, and was used to denote a thing of the least importance. Hence
the popular phrase, "not to care a fig for one;" a sense in which it is
sometimes used by Shakespeare, who makes Pistol say, in "Merry Wives of
Windsor" (i. 3), "a fico for the phrase;" and in "Henry V." (iii. 6),
Pistol exclaims, "figo for thy friendship." In "Othello" (i. 3), Iago
says, "Virtue! a fig."

   The term, "to give or make the fig," as an expression of insult, has
for many ages been very prevalent among the nations of Europe, and
according to Douce <span id="fr_501"></span>[2](#fn_499.md) was known to
the Romans. It consists in thrusting the thumb between two of the closed
fingers, or into the mouth, a practice, as some say, <span
id="fr_502"></span>[3](#fn_500.md) in allusion to a contemptuous punishment
inflicted on the Milanese, by the Emperor Frederic Barbarossa in 1162,
when he took their city. This, however, is altogether improbable, the
real origin no doubt being a coarse w representation of a disease, to
which the name of *ficus* or fig has always been given. <span
id="fr_503"></span>[4](#fn_501.md)

   The "fig of Spain" spoken of in "Henry V." (iii. 6), may either
allude to the poisoned fig employed in Spain as a secret way of
destroying an obnoxious person, as in Webster's "White Devil" <span
id="fr_504"></span>[5](#fn_502.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I do look now for a Spanish fig, or an Italian
salad, daily,"</span>

</div>

And in Shirley's "Brothers" <span id="fr_505"></span>[6](#fn_503.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I must poison him; One fig sends him to
Erebus."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

   It may, as Mr Dyce remarks, <span id="fr_506"></span>[1](#fn_504.md)
simply denote contempt or insult in the sense already mentioned.

   *Flower-de-luce*.—The common purple iris which adorns our gardens is
now generally agreed upon as the fleur-de-luce, a corruption of fleur de
Louis—being spelt either fleur-de-lys or fleur-de-lis. It derives its
name from Louis VII., King of France, who chose this flower as his
heraldic emblem when setting forth on his crusade to the Holy Land. It
had already been used by the other French kings, and by the emperors of
Constantinople; but it is still a matter of dispute among antiquarians
as to what it was originally intended to represent. Some say a flower,
some a toad, some a halbert-head. It is uncertain as to what plant is
referred to by Shakespeare when he alludes to the fleur-de-luce in the
following passage <span id="fr_507"></span>[2](#fn_505.md) in "2 Henry VI."
(v. 1) where the Duke of York says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A sceptre shall it have, hive I a soul,  
 On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France."</span>

</div>

   In "1 Henry VI." (i. 2), Pucelle declares—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am prepared; here is my keen edged sword,  
 Deck’d with five flower-de-luces on each side."</span>

</div>

Some think the lily is meant, others the iris. For the lily theory, says
Mr Ellacombe, <span id="fr_508"></span>[3](#fn_506.md) "there are the facts
that Shakespeare calls it one of the lilies, and that the other way of
spelling is fleur-de-lys."

   Chaucer seems to connect it with the lily (C. T. Prol, 238)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Her nekke was white as the flour-de-lis."</span>

</div>

   On the other hand, Spenser separates the lilies from the
flower-de-lutes in his "Shepherd's Calendar;" and Ben Jonson mentions
"rich carnations, flower-de-luces, lilies."

   The fleur-de-lis was not always confined to royalty as a badge. Thus
in the square of La Pucelle, in Rouen, there is

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

a statue of Jeanne D’Arc with fleur-de-lys sculptured upon it, and an
inscription as follows:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The maiden's sword protects the royal crown;  
 Beneath the maiden's sword the lilies safely blow."</span>

</div>

   St Louis conferred upon the Chateaubriands the device of a
fleur-de-lis, and the motto, "Mon sang teint les bannièrs de France."
When Edward III. claimed the crown of France, in the year 1340, he
quartered the ancient shield of France with the lions of England. It
disappeared, however, from the English shield in the first year of the
present century.

   *Gillifower*.—This was the old name for the whole class of
carnations, pinks, and sweet-williams, from the French *girofle*, which
is itself corrupted from the Latin *cariophyllum*. <span
id="fr_509"></span>[1](#fn_507.md) The streaked gillyflowers, says Mr
Beisly, <span id="fr_510"></span>[2](#fn_508.md) noticed by Perdita in
"Winter's Tale" (iv. 4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The fairest flowers o’ the season  
 Are our carnations and streak’d gillyvors,  
 Which some call nature's bastards"</span>

</div>

"are produced by the flowers of one kind being impregnated by the pollen
of another kind, and this art (or law) in nature Shakspere alludes to in
the delicate language used by Perdita, as well as to the practice of
increasing the plants by slips." Tusser, in his "Five Hundred Points of
Good Husbandry," says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The gilloflower also the skilful doe know,  
 Doth look to be covered in frost and in snow."</span>

</div>

   *Harebell*.—This flower, mentioned in "Cymbeline" (iv. 2), is no
doubt another name for the wild hyacinth.

   Arviragus says of Imogen—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "Thou shalt not lack  
The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor  
The azured harebell, like thy veins."</span>

</div>

   *Hemlock*.—In consequence of its bad and poisonous character, this
plant was considered an appropriate ingredient for

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

witches’ broth. In "Macbeth," (iv. 1), we read of "root of hemlock
digg’d i’ the dark." Its scientific name, *conium*, is from the Greek
word meaning cone or top, whose whirling motion resembles the giddiness
produced on the constitution by its poisonous juice. It is by most
persons supposed to be the death-drink of the Greeks, and the one by
which Socrates was put to death.

   *Herb of Grace* or *Herb Grace*.—A popular name in days gone by for
rue. The origin of the term is uncertain. Most probably it arose from
the extreme bitterness of the plant, which, as it had always borne the
name *rue* (to be sorry for anything), was not unnaturally associated
with repentance. It was, therefore, the herb of repentance, <span
id="fr_511"></span>[1](#fn_509.md)" and this was soon changed into 'herb of
grace,' repentance being the chief sign of grace." The expression is
several times used by Shakespeare. In "Richard II." (iii. 4), the
gardener narrates—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Here did she fall a tear; here in this place  
 I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:  
 Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,  
 In the remembrance of a weeping queen."</span>

</div>

In "Hamlet" (iv. 5), Ophelia, when addressing the queen, says, "There's
rue for you; and here's some for me: we may call it herb-grace o’
Sundays: O, you must wear your rue with a difference." <span
id="fr_512"></span>[2](#fn_510.md)

   Malone observes that there is no ground for supposing that rue was
called "herb of grace" from its being used in exorcisms in churches on
Sunday, a notion entertained by Jeremy Taylor, who says, referring to
the *Flagellum Dæmonum*, "First, they (the Romish exorcisers) are to try
the devil by holy water, incense, sulphur, rue, which from thence, as we
suppose, came to be called "herb of grace." <span
id="fr_513"></span>[3](#fn_511.md) Rue was also a common subject of puns,
from being the

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

same word which signified sorrow or pity (see "Richard II." iii. 4 cited
above).

   *Holy Thistle*.—The Carduus Benedictus, called also "blessed
thistle," was so named, like other plants which bear the specific name
of "blessed," from its supposed power of counteracting the effect of
poison. <span id="fr_514"></span>[1](#fn_512.md) Cogan, in his "Haven of
Health," 1595, says, "This herbe may worthily be called *Benedictus*, or
*Omnimorbia*, that is, a salve for every sore, not known to physitians
of old time, but lately revealed by the special providence of almighty
God." It is alluded to in "Much Ado about Nothing" (iii. 4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Margaret*. Get you some of this distilled Carduus
Benedictus, and lay it to your heart; it is the only thing for a
qualm.  
"*Hero*. There thou prickest her with a thistle.  
"*Beatrice*. Benedictus! why Benedictus? You have some moral in this
Benedictus.  
"*Margaret*. Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning: I mean
plain holy-thistle."</span>

</div>

   *Insane Root*.—There is much doubt as to what plant is meant by
Banquo in "Macbeth" (i. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Have we eaten of the insane root  
 That takes the reason prisoner?"</span>

</div>

   The origin of this passage is probably to be found in North's
"Plutarch—Life of Antony," 1579 (p. 990), where mention is made of a
plant which "made them out of their wits." Several plants have been
suggested—the hemlock, belladonna, mandrake, henbane, &c. Douce supports
the last, and cites the following passage <span
id="fr_515"></span>[2](#fn_513.md):—"Henbane . . . is called insana, mad,
for the use thereof is perillous; for if it be eate or dronke, it
breedeth madness, or slow lykenesse of sleepe." Nares <span
id="fr_516"></span>[3](#fn_514.md) quotes from Ben Jonson ("Sejanus" iii.
2), in support of hemlock—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "Well, read my charms,  
And may they lay that hold upon thy senses  
As thou hadst snufft up hemlock."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

   *Ivy*.—It was formerly the general custom in England, as it is still
in France and the Netherlands, to hang a bush of ivy at the door of a
vintner. Hence the allusion in "As You Like It" (v. 4, Epilogue), where
Rosalind wittingly remarks, "If it be true that good wine needs no bush,
’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue." This custom is often
referred to by our old writers, as, for instance, in Nash's "Summer's
Last Will and Testament; <span id="fr_517"></span>[1](#fn_515.md)" 1600—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Green ivy bushes at the vintner's doors."</span>

</div>

And in the "Rival Friends," 1632—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"’Tis like the ivy bush unto a tavern."</span>

</div>

   This plant was no doubt chosen from its being sacred to Bacchus. The
practice was observed at statute hirings, wakes, &c., by people who sold
ale at no other time. The manner, says Mr Singer, <span
id="fr_518"></span>[2](#fn_516.md) in which they were decorated appears
from a passage in Florio's "Italian Dictionary," in voce *trcmola*,
"Gold foile, or thin leaves of gold or silver, namely, thinne plate, as
our vintners adorn their bushes with." We may compare the old sign of
"An owl in an ivy bush," which perhaps denoted the union of wisdom or
prudence with conviviality, as "be merry and wise."

   *Kecksies*.—These are the dry hollow stalks of hemlock. In "Henry V."
(v. 2), Burgundy makes use of the word:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                    "And nothing teems,  
But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,  
Losing both beauty and utility."</span>

</div>

It has been suggested <span id="fr_519"></span>[3](#fn_517.md) that
kecksies may be a mistaken form of the plural kex; and that kex may have
been formed from keck, something so dry that the eater would keck at it,
or be unable to swallow it. The word is probably derived from the Welsh
"cecys," which is applied to several plants of the umbelliferous kind.
Dr Prior, <span id="fr_520"></span>[4](#fn_518.md) however, says that
kecksies is from an old English word keek, or kike, retained in the
northern counties in the sense of "peep" or "spy."

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

   *Knotgrass*. <span id="fr_521"></span>[1](#fn_519.md)—The allusion to
this plant in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (iii. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                         "Get you gone, you dwarf,  
You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made,  
You bead, you acorn"</span>

</div>

refers to its supposed power of hindering the growth of any child or
animal, when taken in an infusion, a notion alluded to by Beaumont and
Fletcher ("Coxcombe" ii. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"We want a boy extremely for this function,  
 Kept under for a year with milk and knot-grass."</span>

</div>

In "The Knight of the Burning Pestle" (ii. 2), we read:—"The child's a
fatherless child, and say they should put him into a strait pair of
gaskins, ’twere worse than knot-grass; he would never grow after it."

   *Lady Smocks*.—This plant is so-called from the resemblance of its
white flowers to little smocks hung out to dry ("Love's Labour's Lost"
v. 2), as they used to be at that season of the year especially:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When daisies pied and violets blue,  
   And lady-smocks all silver white  
 And cuckoo buds of yellow hue  
   Do paint the meadows with delight,  
  \*      \*      \*      \*      \*      \*  
 When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,  
   And maidens bleach their summer smocks."</span>

</div>

   According to another explanation, the lady's smock is a corruption of
"Our Lady's Smock," so called from its first flowering about Lady-tide.
This plant has also been called cuckoo-flower, because, as Gerarde says,
"it flowers in April and May when the cuckoo doth begin to sing her
pleasant notes without stammering."

   *Laurel*.—From the very earliest times this classical plant has been
regarded as symbolical of victory, and used for crowns. In "Titus
Andronicus" (i. 1), Titus says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel
boughs."</span>

</div>

And in "Antony and Cleopatra" (v. 3), the latter exclaims:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">        "Upon your sword  
Sit laurelled victory." <span id="fr_522"></span>[2](#fn_520.md)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

   *Leek*.—The first of March is observed by the Welsh in honour of St
David, their patron saint, when, as a sign of their patriotism, they
wear a leek. Much doubt exists as to the origin of this custom.
According to the Welsh, it is because St David ordered his Britons to
place leeks in their caps, that they might be distinguished in fight
from their Saxon foes. Shakespeare in "Henry V." (iv. 7), alludes to the
custom when referring to the battle of Cressy. Fluellen says:—"If your
majesties is remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a garden
where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps, which your
majesty know to this hour is an honourable badge of the service; and I
do believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek upon Saint
Tavy's Day." <span id="fr_523"></span>[1](#fn_521.md) Dr Owen Pughe <span
id="fr_524"></span>[2](#fn_522.md) supposes the custom arose from the
practice of every farmer contributing his leek to the common repast when
they met at the Cymmortha, an association by which they reciprocated
assistance in ploughing the land. Anyhow, the subject is one involved in
complete uncertainty, and the various explanations given are purely
conjectural (see page [284](flos13.htm#page_284).md).

   *Lily*.—Although so many pretty legends and romantic superstitions
have. clustered round this sweet and favourite flower, yet they have
escaped the notice of Shakespeare, who, whilst attaching to it the
choicest epithets, has simply made it the type of elegance and beauty,
and the symbol of purity and whiteness.

   *Long Purples*.—This plant mentioned by Shakespeare in "Hamlet" (iv.
7) as forming part of the nosegay of poor Ophelia, is generally
considered to be the early purple orchis (orchis mascula) which blossoms
in April or May. It grows in meadows and pastures, and is about ten
inches high. Tennyson ("A Dirge") uses the name—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Round thee blow, self-pleached deep,  
 Bramble roses, faint and pale,  
 And long purples of the dale."</span>

</div>

   Another term applied by Shakespeare to this flower was

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Dead Men's
Fingers," from the pale colour and hand-like shape of the palmate
tubers—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Our cold maids do dead men's fingers call
them."</span>

</div>

   In "Flowers from Stratford-on-Avon" it is said "there can be no doubt
that the wild arum is the plant alluded to by Shakespeare," but there
seems no authority for this statement.

   *Love-in-Idleness*, or, with more accuracy, *Love-in-Idle*, <span
id="fr_525"></span>[1](#fn_523.md) is one of the many nicknames of the
pansy or heart’s-ease—a term said to be still in use in Warwickshire. It
occurs in "Midsummer Night's Dream" (ii. 1) <span
id="fr_526"></span>[2](#fn_524.md) where Oberon says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Yet mark’d I where the bolt of Cupid fell:  
 It fell upon a little western flower,  
 Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,  
 And maidens call it love-in-idleness."</span>

</div>

The phrase literally signifies love in vain, or to no purpose, as Taylor
alludes to it in the following couplet:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When passions are let loose without a bridle,  
 Then precious time is turned to love and idle."</span>

</div>

   That flowers, and pansies especially, were used as
love-philtres, <span id="fr_527"></span>[3](#fn_525.md) or for the object
of casting a spell over people in Shakespeare's day, is shown in the
passage already quoted, where Puck and Oberon amuse themselves at
Titania's expense. Again, a further reference occurs (iv. 1) where the
king removes the spell—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But first I will release the fairy queen.  
      Be as thou wast wont to be:  
      See as thou wast wont to see:</span>

</div>

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span>       Dian's bud <span
id="fr_528"></span>[1](#fn_526.md) o’er Cupid's flower <span

      Hath such force and blessed power.  
 Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen."</span>

</div>

   "It has been suggested," says Mr Aldis Wright, <span
id="fr_530"></span>[3](#fn_528.md) "that the device employed by Oberon to
enchant Titania by anointing her eyelids with the juice of a flower, may
have been borrowed by Shakespeare from the Spanish Romance of Diana by
George of Montemayor. But apart from the difficulty which arises from
the fact that no English translation of this romance is known before
that published by Young in 1598, there is no necessity to suppose that
Shakespeare was indebted to anyone for what must have been a familiar
element in all incantations at a time when a belief in witchcraft was
common." Percy ("Reliques," iii. b. 2) quotes a receipt by the
celebrated astrologer, Dr Dee, for "an ungent to anoynt under the
eyelids, and upon the eyelids eveninge and morninge, but especially when
you call," that is, upon the fairies. It consisted of a decoction of
various flowers.

   *Mandragora or Mandrake*.—No plant, perhaps, has had, at different
times, a greater share of folk-lore attributed to it than the mandrake;
partly owing probably to the fancied resemblance of its root to the
human figure, and the accidental circumstance of man being the first
syllable of the word. An inferior degree of animal life was assigned to
it; and it was commonly supposed that, when torn from the ground, it
uttered groans of so pernicious a character, that the person who
committed the violence either went mad or died. In "2 Henry VI." (iii.
2), Suffolk says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,  
 I would invent, &c.</span>

</div>

And Juliet (iv. 3) speaks of—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Shrieks like mandrake's torn out of the earth,  
 That living mortals, hearing them, run mad."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> To escape this
danger, it was recommended to tie one end of a string to the plant and
the other to a dog, upon whom the fatal groan would discharge its whole
malignity. The ancients, it appears, were equally superstitious with
regard to this mysterious plant, and Columella, in his directions for
the site of gardens, says they may be formed where—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "The mandrake's flowers  
Produce, whose root shews half a man, whose juice  
With madness strikes."</span>

</div>

Pliny <span id="fr_531"></span>[1](#fn_529.md) informs us that those who
dug up this plant paid particular attention to stand so that the wind
was at their back; and before they began to dig, they made three circles
round the plant with the point of the sword, and then proceeding to the
west commenced digging it up. It seems to have been well known as an
opiate in the time of Shakespeare, who makes Iago say in "Othello,"
(iii. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Not poppy, nor mandragora.  
 Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,  
 Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep  
 Which you owedst yesterday."</span>

</div>

   In "Antony and Cleopatra," (i. 5), the latter pathetically says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">     "Give me to drink mandragora.  
*Char*. Why, madam?  
*Cleo*. That I might sleep out this great gap of time,  
       My Antony is away."</span>

</div>

   Lyte, in his translation of "Dodoens," (1578, 438), tells us that
"the leaves and fruit be also dangerous, for they cause deadly sleepe,
and peevish drowsiness, like opium." It was sometimes regarded as an
emblem of incontinence, as in "2 Henry IV." (i. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Yes, lecherous as a monkey, and the whores call him
mandrake."</span>

</div>

A very diminutive figure was, too, often compared to a mandrake. In "2
Henry IV." (i. 2), Falstaff says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou whoreson mandrake, thou are fitter to be worn
in my cap than to wait at my heels."</span>

</div>

Tracing back the history of this plant into far distant times, it is
generally believed that it is the same as that which the

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

ancient Hebrews called Dudain. <span id="fr_532"></span>[1](#fn_530.md)
That these people held it in the highest esteem in the days of Jacob is
evident from its having been found by Reuben, who carried the plant to
his mother, and the inducement which tempted Leah to part with it,
proves the value then set upon this celebrated plant. According to a
curious superstition this plant was thought to possess the properties of
making childless wives become mothers, and hence some suppose Rachel
became so desirous of possessing the mandrakes which Reuben had found.
Among the many other items of folk-lore associated with the mandrake;
there is one which informs us that "it is perpetually watched over by
Satan, and if it be pulled up at certain holy times, and with certain
invocations, the evil spirit will appear to do the bidding of the
practitioner." <span id="fr_533"></span>[2](#fn_531.md) In comparatively
recent times, quacks and impostors counterfeited with the root briony
figures resembling parts of the human body, which were sold to the
credulous as endued with specific virtues. <span
id="fr_534"></span>[3](#fn_532.md) The Germans, too, equally superstitious,
formed little idols of the roots of the mandrake, which were regularly
dressed every day, and consulted as oracles,—their repute being such
that they were manufactured in great numbers and sold in cases. They
were, also, imported into this country during the time of Henry VIII.,
it being pretended that they would; with the assistance of some mystic
words, increase whatever money was placed near them. In order, too, to
enhance the value of these so-called miracle workers, it was said that
the roots of this plant were produced from the flesh of criminals which
fell from the gibbet, and that it only grew in such a situation. <span
id="fr_535"></span>[4](#fn_533.md)

   *Marigold*.—This flower was a great favourite with our old writers,
from a curious notion that it always opened or shut its flowers at the
sun's bidding; in allusion to which Perdita remarks in "Winter's Tale,"
(iv. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The marigold, that goes to bed wi’ the sun  
 And with him rises weeping."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

   It was also said, but erroneously, to turn its flowers to the sun, a
quality attributed to the sunflower (helianthus annuus), and thus
described by Moore:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The sunflower turns on her god when he sets  
 The same look which she did when he rose."</span>

</div>

   A popular name for the marigold was "mary-bud," mention of which we
find in "Cymbeline," (ii. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Winking Mary-buds begin  
 To ope their golden eyes."</span>

</div>

   *Medlar*.—This fruit, which Shakespeare describes as only fit to be
eaten when rotten, is applied by Lucio to a woman of loose character, as
in "Measure for Measure," (iv. 3):" They would else have married me to
the rotten medlar."

   Chaucer, in the "Reeve's Prologue," applies the same name to it—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"That ilke fruit is ever lenger the wers,  
 Till it be roten in mullok, or in stre.  
 We olde men, I drede, so faren we,  
 Till we be roten can we not be ripe."</span>

</div>

   *Mistletoe*.—This plant, which from the earliest times has been an
object of interest to naturalists, on account of its curious growth,
deriving its subsistence entirely from the branch to which it annexes
itself, has been the subject of wide-spread superstition. In "Titus
Andronicus" (ii. 3), Tamora describes it in the graphic passage below as
"the baleful mistletoe," an epithet which, as Mr Douce observes, is
extremely appropriate either conformably to an ancient, but erroneous,
opinion, that the berries of the mistletoe were poisonous; or on account
of the use made of this plant by the Druids during their detestable
human sacrifices. <span id="fr_536"></span>[1](#fn_534.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">   *Demetrius*. How now, dear sovereign, and our
gracious mother,  
Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?  
   *Tamora*. Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?  
These two have ’tic’d me hither to this place:—  
A barren detested vale you see it is;  
The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,  
O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:  
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,  
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

   *Mushroom*.—Besides his notice of the mushroom in the following
passages, Shakespeare alludes to the fairy rings <span
id="fr_537"></span>[1](#fn_535.md) which are formed by fungi, though, as Mr
Ellacombe <span id="fr_538"></span>[2](#fn_536.md) points out, he probably
knew little of this. In the "Tempest" (v. 1), Prospero says of the
fairies—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "You demi-puppets that  
By [moonshine](errata.htm#5.md) do the green-sour ringlets make,  
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime  
Is to make midnight mushrooms."</span>

</div>

the allusion in this passage being to the superstition that sheep will
not eat the grass that grows on fairy rings.

   *Mustard*.—Tewkesbury mustard, to which reference is made in "2 Henry
IV." (ii. 4), where Falstaff speaks of "wit as thick as Tewkesbury
mustard," was formerly very famous. Shakespeare speaks only of its
thickness, but others have celebrated its pungency. Coles, writing in
1657, says:" In Gloucestershire, about Teuxbury, they grind mustard and
make it into balls, which are brought to London, and other remote
places, as being the best that the world affords."

   *Narcissus*.—The old legend attached to this flower is mentioned by
Emilia in "The Two Noble Kinsmen" (ii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"That was a fair boy certain, but a fool,  
 To love himself; were there not maids enough."</span>

</div>

   *Nutmeg*.—A gilt nutmeg was formerly a common gift at Christmas and
on other festive occasions, a notice of which occurs in "Love's Labour's
Lost" (v. 2), in the following dialogue <span
id="fr_539"></span>[3](#fn_537.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">   "*Armado*. The omnipotent Mars, of lances the
almighty,  
Gave Hector a gift.  
   *Dumain*.                             A gilt nutmeg."</span>

</div>

   *Oak*.—A crown of oak was considered by the Romans worthy of the
highest emulation of statesmen and warriors.

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> To him who had
saved the life of a Roman soldier was given a crown of oak leaves; one,
indeed, which was accounted more honourable than any other. In
"Coriolanus" (ii. 1), Volumnia says—"He comes the third time home with
the oaken garland." And again (i. 3)—"To a cruel war I sent him; from
whence he returned, his brows bound with oak." Montesquieu, indeed, said
that it was with two or three hundred crowns of oak that Rome conquered
the world. Although so much historical and legendary lore have clustered
round the oak, yet scarcely any mention is made of this by Shakespeare.
The legend of Herne the hunter, which seems to have been current at
Windsor, is several times alluded to, as for instance in "Merry Wives of
Windsor" (iv. 4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,  
 Sometime a keeper in Windsor forest,  
 Doth all the winter time, at still midnight,  
 Walk round about an oak, with great ragg’d horns."

 "*Page*. There want not many that do fear  
 In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak."

</div>

   Herne's Oak, so long an object of much curiosity and enthusiasm, is
now no more. According to one theory, the old tree was blown down,
August 31st, 1863; and a young oak was planted by Her Majesty, September
12th, 1863, to mark the spot where Herne's oak stood. <span
id="fr_540"></span>[1](#fn_538.md) Mr Halliwell-Phillipps, however, tells
us, "the general opinion is that it was accidentally destroyed in the
year 1796, through an order of George III. to the bailiff Robinson, that
all the unsightly trees in the vicinity of the castle, should be
removed; an opinion confirmed by a well-established fact, that a person
named Grantham, who contracted with the bailiff for the removal of the
trees, fell into disgrace with the king for having included the oak in
his gatherings." <span id="fr_541"></span>[2](#fn_539.md)

   *Olive*.—This plant ever famous from its association with the return
of the dove to the oak, has been considered typical of peace. It was as
an emblem of peace, that a garland of olive was given to Judith when she
restored peace to the

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Israelites by the
death of Holofernes (Judith xv. i3). It was equally honoured by Greeks
and Romans. It is, too, in this sense, that Shakespeare speaks of it
when he makes Viola in "Twelfth Night" (i. 5), say—"I bring no overture
of war, no taxation of homage; I hold the olive in my hand, my words are
as full of peace as matter." In his "Sonnet" (cvii.), here are too those
well-known lines <span id="fr_542"></span>[1](#fn_540.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And peace proclaims olives of endless age."</span>

</div>

   *Palm*.—As the symbol of victory, this was carried before the
conqueror in triumphal processions. Its classical use is noticed by
Shakespeare in "Coriolanus" (v. 3). Volumnia says <span
id="fr_543"></span>[2](#fn_541.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And bear the palm for having bravely shed  
 Thy wife and children's blood."</span>

</div>

   In "Julius Cæsar" (i. 2), Cassius exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                    "Ye gods, it doth amaze me,  
A man of such a feeble temper should  
So get the start of the majestic world  
And bear the palm alone."</span>

</div>

   Pilgrims were formerly called "palmers," from the staff or bough of
palm they were wont to carry. So in "All's Well That End's Well" (iii.
5), Helena asks—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech
you?"</span>

</div>

   *Pear*.—In his few notices of the pear, Shakespeare only mentions two
by name, the warden and the poperin—the former was chiefly used for
roasting or baking, and is mentioned by the clown in the "Winter's Tale"
(iv. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I must have saffron to colour the warden
pies."</span>

</div>

Hence, Ben Jonson makes a pun upon Church-Warden pie's. According to
some antiquarians, the name warden is from the Anglo-Saxon *wearden*, to
preserve, as it keeps for a long time; but it is more probable that the
word had its origin

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

from the horticultural skill of the Cistercian monks of Wardon Abbey, in
Bedfordshire, founded in the twelfth century. Three warden pears
appeared on the armorial bearings of the Abbey. <span
id="fr_544"></span>[1](#fn_542.md) It is noticeable that the warden pies of
Shakespeare's day, coloured with saffron, have been replaced by stewed
pears coloured with cochineal.

   *The Poperin*.—This pear was probably introduced from Flanders by the
Antiquary Leland, who was made rector of Popering, by Henry VIII. It is
alluded to by Mercutio in "Romeo and Juliet" (ii. 1), where he wishes
that Romeo were "a poperin pear." In the old dramas there is much
attempt at wit on this pear.

   *Peas*.—A practice called "peascod wooing" was formerly a common mode
of divination in love affairs. The cook, when shelling green peas,
would, if she chanced to find a pod having nine, lay it on the lintel of
the kitchen door, and the first man who entered was supposed to be her
future husband. Another way of divination by peascod consisted in the
lover selecting one growing on the stem, snatching it away quickly, and
if the good omen of the peas remaining in the husk were preserved, in
then presenting it to the lady of his choice. Touchstone in "As You Like
It" (ii. 4), alludes to this piece of popular suggestion:—"I remember
the wooing of a peascod <span id="fr_545"></span>[2](#fn_543.md) instead of
her." Gay, who has carefully chronicled many a custom of his time, says
in his "Fourth Pastoral":—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As peascods once I pluck’d, I chanc’d to see,  
 One that was closely fill’d with three times three,  
 Which when I cropp’d I safely home convey’d,  
 And o’er my door the spell in secret laid."</span>

</div>

We may quote as a further illustration the following stanza from
Browne's "Pastorals" (Bk. ii., song 3).

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The peascod greene, oft with no little toyle,  
 He’d seek for in the fattest, fertil’st soile,  
 And rende it from the stalke to bring it to her,  
 And in her bosom for acceptance wooe her." <span
id="fr_546"></span>[3](#fn_544.md)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

   *Plantain*.—The leaves of this plant were carefully valued by our
forefathers for their supposed efficacy in healing wounds, &c. It was
also considered as a preventive of poison. And to this supposed virtue
we find an allusion in "Romeo and Juliet"(i. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Benvolio*. Take thou some new infection to thy
eye,  
             And the rank poison of the old will die.  
 *Romeo*. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.  
 *Benvolio*. For what, I pray thee?  
 *Romeo*. For your broken skin." <span
id="fr_547"></span>[1](#fn_545.md)</span>

</div>

In the "Two Noble Kinsmen" (i. 2), Palamon says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">       "These poor slight sores  
Need not a plantain."</span>

</div>

   *Poppy*.—The plant referred to by Shakespeare in "Othello" (iii. 3),
is the opium poppy, well known in his day for its deadly qualities. It
is described by Spencer, "Faerie Queene" (ii. 7, 52), as the
"dead-sleeping poppy," and Drayton ("Nymphal" v.), enumerates it among
the flowers that procure "deadly sleeping."

   *Potato*.—It is curious enough, says Nares <span
id="fr_548"></span>[2](#fn_546.md) to find that excellent root which now
forms a regular portion of the daily nutriment of every individual, and
is the chief or entire support of multitudes in Ireland, spoken of
continually as having some powerful effect upon the human frame, in
exciting the desires and passions—yet this is the case in all the
writings contemporary with Shakespeare. Thus Falstaff in "Merry Wives of
Windsor" (v. 5) says:—"Let the sky rain potatoes; let it thunder to the
tune of Green Sleeves, hail kissing comfits," &c. In "Troilus and
Cressida" (v. 2) Thersites adds:—"How the devil Luxury with his fat rump
and potato finger, tickles these together." <span
id="fr_549"></span>[3](#fn_547.md) It appears, too, that the medical
writers of the times countenanced this fancy. Mr Ellacombe <span
id="fr_550"></span>[4](#fn_548.md) observes that the above passages are of
peculiar interest inasmuch as they contain almost the

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

earliest notice of potatoes after their introduction into England.

   *Primrose*.—Although the early primrose has always been such a
popular and favourite flower, yet it seems to have been associated with
sadness, <span id="fr_551"></span>[1](#fn_549.md) or even worse than
sadness; for in the following passages the "primrose paths," and
"primrose way," are meant to be suggestive of sinful pleasures. Thus in
"Hamlet" (i. 3), Ophelia says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Like a puffed and reckless libertine,  
 Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,  
 And recks not his own rede."</span>

</div>

And in "Macbeth" (ii. 3), the porter declares:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I had thought to have let in some of all
professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire."</span>

</div>

Curious to say, too, Shakespeare's only epithets for this fair flower
are "pale," "faint," "that die unmarried." Nearly all the poets of that
time spoke of it in the same strain, with the exception of Ben Jonson
and the two Fletchers.

   *Reed*—Among the uses to which the reed was formerly applied were the
thatching of houses, and the making of shepherds’ pipes. The former is
alluded to in the "Tempest" (v. i.):—"His tears run down his beard, like
winter's drops from eaves of reeds"; and the latter in "Merchant of
Venice" (iii. 4), where Portia speaks of "a reed voice." It has
generally been regarded as the emblem of weakness, as in "Antony and
Cleopatra" (ii. 7)—"A reed that will do me no service."

   *Rose*.—As might be expected, the rose is the flower most frequently
mentioned by Shakespeare; denoting. in many cases the symbol of all that
is fair and lovely. Thus, for instance, in "Hamlet" (iii. 4), the queen
says

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Such an act . . . takes off the rose  
 From the fair forehead of an innocent love,  
 And sets a blister there."</span>

</div>

And Ophelia (iii. i), describes Hamlet as—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The expectancy and rose of the fair state."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In days gone by
the rose entered largely into the customs and superstitions of most
nations, and even now-a-days there is an extensive folklore associated
with it.

It appears that in Shakspeare's time one of the fashions of the day was
the wearing of enormous roses on the shoes, of which full-length
portraits afford striking examples. <span
id="fr_552"></span>[1](#fn_550) Hamlet (iii. 2.md) speaks "of two
provincial roses on his razed shoes."—meaning, no doubt, rosettes of
ribbon in the shape of roses of Provins or Provence. Douce favours the
former, Warton the latter locality. In either case it was a large rose.
The Province or damask rose, was probably the better known. Gerarde in
his "Herbal," says that the damask rose is called by some "Rosa
provincialis." <span id="fr_553"></span>[2](#fn_551.md) Mr Fairholt <span
id="fr_554"></span>[3](#fn_552.md) quotes from Friar Bacon's Prophecy,
1604, the following in allusion to this fashion:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When roses in the gardens grew,  
 And not in ribbons on a shoe:  
 Now ribbon roses take such place  
 That garden roses want their grace."</span>

</div>

   Again, in King John (i. 1), where the Bastard alludes to the
three-farthing silver pieces of Queen Elizabeth, which were extremely
thin, and had the profile of the sovereign, with a rose on the back of
her head, there doubtless is a fuller reference to the court fashion of
sticking roses in the ear:— <span id="fr_555"></span>[4](#fn_553.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                               "My face so thin,  
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose,  
Lest men should say, 'Look, where three-farthings goes.'"</span>

</div>

   Shakspeare also mentions the use of the rose in rose-cakes and
rose-water, the former in "Romeo and Juliet" (v. r), where Romeo speaks
of "old cakes of roses," the latter in "Taming the Shrew" (induction,
sc. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Let one attend him with a silver basin  
 Full of rose water and bestrewed with flowers."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

   Referring to its historical lore, we may mention its famous
connection with the "Wars of the Roses." In the fatal dispute in the
Temple Gardens, Somerset, on the part of Lancaster, says, ("1 Henry VI."
ii. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,  
 But dare maintain the party of the truth,  
 Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me."</span>

</div>

Warwick, on the part of York, replies:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I have no colours, and without all colour  
 Of base insinuating flattery  
 I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet."</span>

</div>

   The trailing white dog-rose is commonly considered to have been the
one chosen by the house of York. A writer however, in the "Quarterly
Review" (vol. cxiv.), has shown that the white rose has a very ancient
interest for Englishmen, as, long before the brawl in the Temple
Gardens, the flower had been connected with one of the most ancient
names of our island. The elder Pliny, in discussing the etymology of the
word Albion, suggests that the land may have been so named from the
white roses which abounded in it. The York and Lancaster rose, with its
pale striped flowers, is a variety of the French rose known as Rosa
Gallica. It became famous when the two emblematical roses, in the
persons of Henry VII. and Elizabeth of York at last brought peace and
happiness to the country which had been so long divided by internal
warfare. The canker rose referred to by Shakspeare is the wild dog rose,
a name occasionally applied to the common red poppy.

   *Rosemary*.—This plant was formerly in very high esteem, and was
devoted to various uses. It was supposed to strengthen the memory, hence
it was regarded as a symbol of remembrance, and on this account was
often given to friends. Thus, in "Hamlet" (iv. 5), where Ophelia seems
to be addressing Laertes, she says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"There's rosemary, that's for remembrance."</span>

</div>

In the "Winter's Tale" (iv. 4), rosemary and rue are beautifully put
together:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For you there's rosemary and rue, these keep;  
 Seeming and savour all the winter long:  
 Grace and Remembrance be to you both,  
 And welcome to our shearing."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Besides being used
at weddings, it was also in request at funerals, probably for its odour,
and as a token of remembrance of the deceased. Thus the Friar in "Romeo
and Juliet" (iv. 5) says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary  
 On this fair corse."</span>

</div>

   This practice is thus touchingly alluded to by Gay in his
"Pastorals"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"To shew their love, the neighbours far and near  
 Followed with wistful look, the damsel's bier:  
 Sprigg’d rosemary the lads and lasses bore,  
 While dismally the parson walk’d before."</span>

</div>

Rosemary, too, was one of the evergreens with which dishes were
anciently garnished during the season of Christmas, an allusion to which
occurs in "Pericles" (iv. 6)—"Marry, come up my dish of chastity, with
rosemary and bays."

   *Rush*.—Before the introduction of carpets, the floors of churches
and houses were strewed with rushes, a custom to which Shakespeare makes
several allusions. In "Taming of the Shrew" (iv. i.) Grumio asks—"Is
supper ready, the house trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept;" and
Glendower in "1 Henry IV." (iii. 1) says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down  
 And rest your gentle head upon her lap." <span
id="fr_556"></span>[1](#fn_554.md)</span>

</div>

At the coronation of Henry V. ("2 Henry IV.," v. 5) when the procession
is coming, the grooms cry, "More rushes, more rushes," which seems to
have been the usual cry for rushes to be scattered on a pavement or a
platform when a procession was approaching. <span
id="fr_557"></span>[2](#fn_555) Again, in "Richard II." (i. 3.md) the
custom is further alluded to by John of Gaunt, who speaks of the
presence strew’d," referring to the presence chamber. So, too, in
"Cymbeline" (ii. 2), Iachimo soliloquizes—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "Tarquin thus  
Did softly press the rushes ere he waken’d  
The chastity he wounded."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And in "Romeo and
Juliet" (i. 4) Romeo says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Let wantons light of heart  
 Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels."</span>

</div>

—an expression which Middleton has borrowed in his "Blunt Master
Constable," 1602—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Bid him, whose heart no sorrow feels,  
 Tickle the rushes with his wanton heels,  
 I have too much lead at mine."</span>

</div>

In the "Two Noble Kinsmen" (ii. 1) the gaoler's daughter is represented
carrying "strewings" for the two prisoners’ chamber.

   Rush-bearings were a sort of rural festival, when the parishioners
brought rushes to strew the church. <span
id="fr_558"></span>[1](#fn_556.md)

   The "rush-ring" appears to have been a kind of token for plighting of
troth among rustic lovers. It was afterwards vilely used, however, for
mock marriages, as appears from one of the Constitutions of Salisbury.
In "All's Well that Ends Well" (ii. 2) there seems a covert allusion to
the rush-ring—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As a Tib's Rush for Tom's forefinger."</span>

</div>

Spenser, in the "Shepherd's Kalendar," speaks of—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The knotted rush-rings and gilt Rosemarie."</span>

</div>

Du Breul, in his "Antiquities of Paris," <span
id="fr_559"></span>[2](#fn_557.md) mentions the rush-ring as "a kind of
espousal used in France by such persons as meant to live together in a
state of concubinage; but in England it was scarcely ever practised
except by designing men, for the purpose of corrupting those young women
to whom they pretended love."

   The "rush candle," which in times past was found in nearly every
house, and served as a night-light for the rich and candle for the poor,
is mentioned in "Taming of the Shrew" (iv. 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Be it moon or sun, or what you please:  
 An if you please to call it a rush candle,  
 Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me."</span>

</div>

   *Saffron*.—In the following passage ("All's Well that Ends Well," iv.
5) there seems to be an allusion <span id="fr_560"></span>[3](#fn_558.md)
by Lafeu to the

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

fashionable and fantastic custom of wearing yellow, and to that of
colouring paste with saffron:—"No, no, no, your son was misled with a
snipt-taffeta fellow, whose villanous saffron would have made all the
unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in his colour."

   *Spear-grass*.—This plant—perhaps the common reed—is noticed in "1
Henry IV." (ii. 4) as used for tickling the nose and making it bleed. In
Lupton's "Notable Things" it is mentioned as part of a medical
recipe—"Whoever is tormented with sciatica or the hip gout, let them
take an herb called spear-grass, and stamp it and lay a little thereof
upon the grief." Mr Ellacombe <span id="fr_561"></span>[1](#fn_559.md)
thinks that the plant alluded to is the common couch grass, (Triticum
repens), which is still known in the Eastern Counties as spear-grass.

   *Stover*.—This word, which is often found in the writings of
Shakespeare's day, denotes fodder and provision of all sorts for cattle.
In Cambridgeshire, stover signifies hay made of coarse rank grass, such
as even cows will not eat while it is green. In the "Tempest" (iv. 1)
Iris says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,  
 And flat meads thatch’d with stover, them to keep."</span>

</div>

According to Steevens, stover was used as a thatch for cart-lodges and
other buildings that required but cheap coverings.

   *Strawberry*.—Shakespeare's mention of the strawberry in connection
with the nettle in "Henry V." (i. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The strawberry grows [underneath](errata.htm#6.md) the
nettle  
 And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best  
 Neighbour’d by fruit of baser quality."</span>

</div>

deserves, says Mr. Ellacombe, a passing note. "It was the common opinion
in his day that plants were affected by the neighbourhood of other
plants to such an extent that they imbibed each other's virtues and
faults. Thus sweet flowers were planted near fruit trees with the idea
of improving the flavour of the fruit, and evil-smelling trees, like the
elder, were carefully cleared away from fruit trees, lest they should be
tainted. But the strawberry was supposed to be an exception to the rule,
and was said to thrive in the midst of 'evil communications without
being corrupted.'"

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

   *Thorns*.—The popular tradition which represents the marks on the
moon <span id="fr_562"></span>[1](#fn_560.md) to be that of a man carrying
a thorn-bush on his head, is alluded to in "Midsummer Night's Dream" (v.
1) in the prologue: "This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
presenteth Moonshine." Little else is mentioned by Shakespeare with
regard to thorns, save that they are generally used by him as the
emblems of desolation and trouble.

   *Violets*.—An old superstition is alluded to by Shakespeare, when he
makes Laertes wish that violets may spring from the grave of Ophelia
("Hamlet" v. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">              "Lay her i’ the earth:  
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh  
May violets spring."</span>

</div>

an idea which occurs in Persius's "Satires" (i. 39)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "—E tumulo fortunataque favilla  
Nascentur violæ."</span>

</div>

   The violet has generally been associated with early death. This, Mr
Ellacombe considers <span id="fr_563"></span>[2](#fn_561.md) "may have
arisen from a sort of pity for flowers that were only allowed to see the
opening year, and were cut off before the first beauty of summer had
come, and so were looked upon as apt emblems of those who enjoyed the
bright springtide of life and no more." Thus, the violet is one of the
flowers which Marina carries to hang "as a chaplet on the grave" in
"Pericles" (iv. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "The yellows, blues,  
The purple violets and marigolds,  
Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,  
While summer-days do last."</span>

</div>

   Again, in that exquisite passage in the "Winter's Tale" (iv. 4),
where Perdita enumerates the flowers of spring, she speaks of:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "Violets dim,  
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes  
Or Cytherea's breath."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Upon which Mr
Singer <span id="fr_564"></span>[1](#fn_562.md) thus comments:—"The eyes of
Juno were as remarkable as those of Pallas, and:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Of a beauty never yet  
 Equalled in height of tincture."</span>

</div>

The beauties of Greece and other Asiatic nations tinged their eyes of an
obscure violet colour, by means of some unguent, which was doubtless
perfumed like those for the hair, etc., mentioned by Athenæus.

   *Willow*.—From time immemorial the willow has been regarded as the
symbol of sadness. Hence it was customary for those who were forsaken in
love, to wear willow garlands—a practice to which Shakespeare gives
several allusions. In "Othello" (iv. 3), Desdemona, anticipating her
death, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My mother had a maid call’d Barbara;  
 She was in love, and he she loved proved mad,  
 And did forsake her: she had a song of willow,  
 An old thing ’twas, but it express’d her fortune,  
 And she died singing it: that song to-night  
 Will not go from my mind."</span>

</div>

The following is the song <span id="fr_565"></span>[2](#fn_563.md):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,  
                       Sing all a green willow;  
 Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,  
                       Sing willow, willow, willow:  
 The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur’d her moans,  
                       Sing willow, willow, willow;  
 Her salt tears fell from her, and soften’d the stones,  
                       Sing willow, willow, willow:  
 Sing all a green willow must be my garland."</span>

</div>

And further on Emilia says (v. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "I will play the swan,  
And die in music \[singing\], willow, willow, willow."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And, again,
Lorenzo, in "Merchant of Venice" (v. 1), narrates:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">              "In such a night  
Stood Dido, with a willow in her hand  
Upon the wild sea-banks."</span>

</div>

   It was, too, in reference to this custom that Shakespeare in "Hamlet"
(iv. 7), represented poor Ophelia hanging her flowers on the "willow
aslaunt a brook." "This tree," says Douce <span
id="fr_566"></span>[1](#fn_564.md) "might have been chosen as the symbol of
sadness from the cxxxvii. Psalm (verse 2)—'We hanged our harps upon the
willows;' or else from a coincidence between the weeping-willow and
falling tears." Another reason has been assigned. The agnus castus was
supposed to promote chastity, and "the willow being of a much like
nature," says Swan, in his "Speculum Mundi," 1635, "it is yet a custom
that he which is deprived of his love must wear a willow garland." Bona,
the sister of the King of France, on receiving news of Edward the
Fourth's marriage with Elizabeth Grey, exclaimed, "In hope he'll prove a
widower shortly, I'll wear a willow garland for his sake."

   *Wormwood*.—The use of this plant in weaning infants is alluded to in
"Romeo and Juliet" (i. 3) by Juliet's nurse in the following passage—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,  
   .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
 When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple  
 Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool."</span>

</div>

   *Yew*.—This tree styled by Shakespeare "the dismal yew" ("Titus and
Andronicus," ii. 3) apart from the many superstitions associated with
it, has been very frequently planted in churchyards, besides being used
at funerals. Paris in "Romeo and Juliet" (v. 3) says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Under yon yew trees lay thee all along,  
 Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;  
 So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,  
 Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,  
 But thou shalt hear it."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

   Although various reasons have been assigned for planting the yew tree
in churchyards, it seems probable that the practice had a superstitious
origin. As witches were supposed to exercise a powerful influence over
the winds, they were believed occasionally to exert their formidable
power against religious edifices. Thus Macbeth says (iv. i)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Though you untie the winds and let them fight  
 Against the churches."</span>

</div>

To counteract, therefore, this imaginary danger, our ancestors may have
planted the yew tree in their churchyards—not only on account of its
vitality as an evergreen, but as connected, in some way in heathen
times, with the influence of evil powers. <span
id="fr_567"></span>[1](#fn_565.md) In a statute made in the latter part of
Edward the First's reign, to prevent rectors from cutting down trees in
churchyards, we find the following: "Verum arbores ipsæ, propter
ventorum impetus ne ecclesiis noceant, sœpe plantantur." <span
id="fr_568"></span>[2](#fn_566.md)

   The custom of sticking yew in the shroud is alluded to in the
following song in "Twelfth Night" (ii. 4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,  
    O, prepare it!  
 My part of death, no one so true  
    Did share it."</span>

</div>

Through being reckoned poisonous, it is [introduced](errata.htm#7.md) in
"Macbeth" (iv. 1), in connection with the witches—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Gall of goat, and slips of yew  
 Sliver’d in the moon's eclipse."</span>

</div>

   "How much the splitting or tearing off of the slip had to do with
magic we learn from a piece of Slavonic folk-lore. It is unlucky to use
for a beam, a branch, or a tree, broken by the wind. The devil, or storm
spirit, claims it as his own, and, were it used, the evil spirit would
haunt the house. It is a broken branch the witches choose; a sliver’d
slip the woodman will have none of." <span
id="fr_569"></span>[3](#fn_567.md)

   Its epithet, "double fatal" "Richard II." (iii. 2), no doubt refers
to the poisonous quality of the leaves, and on account

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

of its wood being employed for instruments of death. Sir Stephen Scroop,
when telling Richard of Bolingbroke's revolt, declares that "the very
beadsmen learn to bend their bows of double-fatal yew against thy
state."

   It has been suggested that the poison intended by the Ghost in
"Hamlet" (i. 5), when he speaks of the juice of cursed ebenon is that of
the yew, and is the same as Marlowe's "juice of hebon" ("Jew of Malta,"
iii. 4). The yew is called hebon by Spenser, and by other writers of
Shakespeare's age; and, in its various forms of eben, eiben, hiben,
etc., this tree is so named in no less than five different European
languages. From medical authorities, both of ancient and modern times,
it would seem that the juice of the yew is a rapidly fatal poison; next,
that the symptoms attendant upon yew poisoning correspond, in a very
remarkable manner, with those which follow the bites of poisonous
snakes; and lastly, that no other poison but the yew produces the
"lazar-like" ulcerations on the body, upon which Shakespeare, in this
passage, lays so much stress. <span id="fr_570"></span>[1](#fn_568.md)

   Amongst the other explanations of this passage, is the well-known one
which identifies "hebenon" with henbane. Mr Beisly suggests that
nightshade may be meant, while Nares considers that ebony is
meant. <span id="fr_571"></span>[2](#fn_569.md)

   From certain ancient statutes it appears that every Englishman, while
archery was practised, was obliged to keep in his house either a bow of
yew or some other wood. <span id="fr_572"></span>[3](#fn_570.md)
