### CHAPTER XX.

#### HUMAN BODY.

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> would be difficult to enumerate the
manifold forms of superstition which have, in most countries, in the
course of past centuries, clustered round the human body. Many
[of](errata.htm#9) these, too, may still be found scattered, here and
there, throughout our own country. One of the most deep-rooted being
palmistry, several allusions to which are made by Shakespeare.

   According to a popular belief current in years past, a trembling of
the body was supposed to be an indication of demoniacal possession.
Thus, in the "Comedy of Errors" (iv. 4), the courtezan says of
Antipholus of Ephesus—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy."</span>

</div>

and Pinch adds—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,  
 To yield possession to my holy prayers,  
 And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight;  
 I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven."</span>

</div>

   In the "Tempest" (ii. 2), Caliban says to Stephano, "Thou dost me yet
but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I know it by thy trembling."

   It was formerly supposed that our bodies consisted of the four
elements—fire, air, earth, and water, and that all diseases arose from
derangement in the due proportion of these elements. Thus in Antony's
eulogium on Brutus in "Julius Cæsar" (v. 5) this theory is alluded to:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"His life was gentle, and the elements  
 So mix’d in him that Nature might stand up  
 And say to all the world, 'this was a man!'"</span>

</div>

<span id="page_446">p. 446</span>

   In "Twelfth Night" (ii. 3) it is also noticed:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Sir Toby*. Do not our life consist of the four
elements?  
 *Sir Andrew*. ’Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists of
eating and drinking.  
 *Sir Toby*. Thou art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink. Marian,
I say! a stoop of wine!"</span>

</div>

   In "Antony and Cleopatra" (v. 2), Shakespeare makes the latter say—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am fire and air, my other elements  
 I give to baser life."</span>

</div>

   This theory is the subject, too, of the 44th and 45th sonnets, and is
set forth at large in its connection with physic in Sir Philip Sydney's
"Arcadia":—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O elements, by whose (men say) contention,  
 Our bodies be in living power maintained,  
 Was this man's death the fruit of your dissension?  
 O physic's power, which (some say) hath restrained  
 Approach of death, alas, thou keepest meagerly,  
 When once one is for Atropos distrained,  
 Great be physicians’ brags, but aide is beggarly  
 When rooted moisture fails, or groweth drie  
 They leave off all, and say, death comes too eagerly.  
 They are but words therefore that men doe buy  
 Of any, since God Esculapius ceased."</span>

</div>

   This notion was substantially adopted by Galen, and embraced by the
physicians of the olden times. <span id="fr_904"></span>[1](#fn_901)

   *Blood*.—In old phraseology this word was popularly used for
disposition or temperament. In "Timon of Athens" (iv. 2), Flavius
says:—"Strange, unusual blood, when man's worst sin is, he does too much
good!" In the opening passage of "Cymbeline" it occurs in the same
sense—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods  
 No more obey the heavens than our courtiers  
 Still seem as does the king."</span>

</div>

the meaning evidently being that, "our dispositions no longer obey the
influences of heaven; they are courtiers, and still seem to resemble the
disposition the king is in."

   Again, in "Much Ado About Nothing" (ii. 3)—"Wisdom

<span id="page_447">p. 447</span>

and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that
blood hath the victory."

   Once more, in "King Lear" (iv. 2), the Duke of Albany says to
Goneril—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "Were't my fitness  
To let these hands obey my blood,  
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear  
Thy flesh and bones."</span>

</div>

   Again, the phrase "to be in blood," was a term of the chase, meaning
to be in good condition, to be vigorous. In "1 Henry VI." (iv. 2),
Talbot exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If we be English deer, be then in blood;  
 Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch."</span>

</div>

—the expression being put in opposition to "rascal," which was the term
for the deer when lean and out of condition. In "Love's Labour's Lost"
(iv. 2), Holofernes says—"The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood."

   The notion that the blood may be thickened by emotional influences,
is mentioned by Polixenes in the "Winter's Tale" (i. 2), where he speaks
of "thoughts that would thick my blood." In King John's temptation of
Hubert to murder Arthur (iii. 3), it is thus referred to—.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,  
 Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-sick,  
 Which else runs tickling up and down the veins," etc.</span>

</div>

   Red blood was considered a traditionary sign of courage. Hence in the
"Merchant of Venice" (ii. x), the Prince of Morocco, when addressing
himself to Portia, and urging his claims for her hand, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Bring me the fairest creature northward born,  
 Where Phoebus’ fire scarce thaws the icicles,  
 And let us make incision for your love, <span
id="fr_905"></span>[1](#fn_902)  
 To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_448">p. 448</span>

   Again, in the present play, cowards are said to "have livers as white
as milk," and an effeminate man is termed a "milksop." Macbeth, too, (v.
3) calls one of his frighted soldiers a "lily-liver’d boy." And in "King
Lear" (ii. 2), the Earl of Kent makes use of the same phrase. In
illustration of this notion Mr Douce <span
id="fr_906"></span>[1](#fn_903) quotes from Bartholomew Glantville, who
says—"Reed clothes have been layed upon deed men in remembrance of theyr
hardynes and boldnes, whyle they were in theyr bloudde."

   The absence of blood in the liver as the supposed property of a
coward, originated, says Dr Bucknill, <span
id="fr_907"></span>[2](#fn_904) in the old theory of the circulation of
the blood, which explains Sir Toby's remarks on his dupe in "Twelfth
Night" (iii. 2)—"For Andrew, if he were opened, and you find so much
blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of
the anatomy."

   We may quote here a notion referred to in "Lucrece" (1747–50) that,
ever since the sad death of Lucrece, corrupted blood has watery
particles—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"About the mourning and congealed face  
 Of that blood a watery rigol goes,  
 Which seems to weep upon the tainted place:  
 And ever since, as pitying Lucrece's woes,  
 Corrupted blood some watery token shows;  
   And blood untainted still doth red abide,  
   Blushing at that which is so putrified."</span>

</div>

   Brain.—By old anatomists the brain was divided into three ventricles,
in the hindermost of which they placed the memory. That this division
was not unknown to Shakespeare, is apparent from "Love's Labour's Lost"
(iv. 2), where Holofernes says—"A foolish extravagant spirit, full of
forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,
revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of memory." Again, Lady
Macbeth (i. 7), speaking of Duncan's two chamberlains, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Will I with wine and wassail so convince  
 That memory, the warder of the brain,  
 Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason  
 A limbeck only."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_449">p. 449</span>

   The "third ventricle is the cerebellum, by which the brain is
connected with the spinal marrow and the rest of the body; the memory is
posted in the cerebellum like a warder or sentinel to warn the reason
against attack. Thus, when the memory is converted by intoxication into
a mere fume, <span id="fr_908"></span>[1](#fn_905) then it fills the
brain itself—the receipt or receptacle of reason, which thus becomes
like an alembic or cap of a still." <span
id="fr_909"></span>[2](#fn_906)

   A popular nickname, in former times, for the skull, was "brain-pan;"
to which Cade, in "2 Henry VI." (iv. 10), refers:—"Many a time, but for
a sallet, my brain-pan had been cleft with a brown bill." The phrase "to
beat out the brains" is used by Shakespeare metaphorically in the sense
of defeat or destroy; just as now-a-days we popularly speak of knocking
a scheme on the head. In "Measure for Measure" (v. 1), the Duke
addressing Isabel tells her:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O most kind maid,  
 It was the swift celerity of his death  
 Which I did think with slower foot came on,  
 That brain’d my purpose."</span>

</div>

   The expression "to bear a brain," which is used by the Nurse in
"Romeo and Juliet" (i. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nay, I do bear a brain,"</span>

</div>

denoted "much mental capacity either of attention, ingenuity, or
remembrance." <span id="fr_910"></span>[3](#fn_907) Thus in Marston's
"Dutch Courtezan" (1605), we read:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My silly husband, alas! knows nothing of it, ’tis  
 I that must beare a braine for all."</span>

</div>

   The notion of the brain as the seat of the soul is mentioned by
Prince Henry, who, referring to King John (v. 7), says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                        "His pure brain  
Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house  
Doth by the idle comments that it makes  
Foretell the ending of mortality."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_450">p. 450</span>

   *Ear*.—According to a well-known superstition, much credited in days
gone by, and still extensively believed, a tingling of the right ear is
considered lucky, being supposed to denote that a friend is speaking
well of one, whereas a tingling of the left is said to imply the
opposite. This notion, however, varies in different localities, as in
some places it is the tingling of the left ear which denotes the friend,
and the tingling of the right ear the enemy. In "Much ado about Nothing"
(iii. 1), Beatrice asks Ursula and Hero, who had been talking of her:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What fire is in mine ears?"</span>

</div>

the reference, no doubt, being to this popular fancy. Sir Thomas
Browne <span id="fr_911"></span>[1](#fn_908) ascribes the idea to the
belief in guardian angels, who touch the right or left ear according as
the conversation is favourable or not to the person.

   In Shakespeare's day it was customary for young gallants to wear a
long lock of hair dangling by the ear, known as a "love-lock." Hence in
"Much ado about Nothing" (iii. 3), the Watch identifies one of his
delinquents:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I know him; a’ wears a lock." <span
id="fr_912"></span>[2](#fn_909)</span>

</div>

Again, further on (v. 1), Dogberry gives another allusion to this
practice:—"He wears a key in his ear, and a lock hanging by it."

   An expression of endearment current in years gone by was "to bite the
ear." In "Romeo and Juliet" (ii. 4), Mercutio says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I will bite thee by the ear for that jest."</span>

</div>

a passage which is explained in Nares’ ("Glossary," i. p. 8i), by the
following one from Ben Jonson's "Alchemist" (ii. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Mammon*. Th’ hast witch’d me, rogue; take, go.  
 *Face*. Your jack, and all, sir.  
 *Mammon*. Slave, I could bite thine ear . . . Away, thou dost not care
for me!"</span>

</div>

Gifford, in his notes on Jonson's Works (ii. p. 184), says the odd mode
of expressing pleasure by biting the ear seems "to

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

be taken from the practice of animals, who, in a playful mood, bite each
other's ears."

   Whilst speaking of the ear, it may be noted that the so-called want
of ear for music has been regarded as a sign of an austere disposition.
Thus Cæsar says of Cassius (i. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">          "He hears no music,  
Seldom he smiles."</span>

</div>

There is too the well-known passage in the "Merchant of Venice" (v. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The man that hath no music in himself,  
 Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,  
 Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils."</span>

</div>

According to the Italian proverb:—"Whom God loves not, that man loves
not music." <span id="fr_913"></span>[1](#fn_910)

   *Elbow*.—According to a popular belief the itching of the elbow
denoted an approaching change of some kind or other. <span
id="fr_914"></span>[2](#fn_911) Thus in "1 Henry IV." (v. 1), the King
speaks of—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Fickle changelings and poor discontents,  
 Which gape and rub the elbow at the news  
 Of hurlyburly innovation."</span>

</div>

With this idea we may compare similar ones connected with other parts of
the body. Thus in "Macbeth" (iv. 1), one of the Witches exclaims:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By the pricking of my thumbs,  
 Something wicked this way comes."</span>

</div>

Again, in "Troilus and Cressida" (ii. 1), Ajax says, "My fingers
itch," <span id="fr_915"></span>[3](#fn_912) and an itching palm was
said to be an indication that the person would shortly receive money.
Hence it denoted a hand ready to receive bribes. Thus in "Julius Cæsar"
(iv. 3), Brutus says to Cassius:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself  
 Are much condemn’d to have an itching palm;  
 To sell and mart your offices for gold  
 To undeservers."</span>

</div>

So in "Merry Wives of Windsor" (ii. 3), Shallow says:—"If I see a sword
out, my finger itches to make one."

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

   Again, in "Othello" (iv. 3), poor Desdemona says to Emilia:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Mine eyes do itch;  
 Doth that bode weeping?"</span>

</div>

   Grose alludes to this superstition, and says, "when the right eye
itches, the party affected will shortly cry; if the left, they will
laugh." The itching of the eye as an omen is spoken of by Theocritus,
who says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My right eye itches now, and I will see my
love."</span>

</div>

   *Eyes*.—A good deal of curious folk-lore has, at one time or another,
clustered round the eye; and the well-known superstition known as the
"evil eye" has already been described in the chapter on "Birth and
Baptism." Blueness above the eye was, in days gone by, considered a sign
of love, and as such is alluded to by Rosalind in "As You Like It" (iii.
2), where she enumerates the marks of love to Orlando:—"A lean cheek,
which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not."

   The term "baby in the eye" was sportively applied by our forefathers
to the miniature reflection of himself, which a person may see in the
pupil of another's eye. In "Timon of Athens" (i. 2), one of the Lords
says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Joy had the like conception in our eyes,  
 And at that instant like a babe sprung up."</span>

</div>

—an allusion probably being made to this whimsical notion. It is often
referred to by old writers, as for instance by Drayton in his "Ideas"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But O, see, see! we need enquire no further,  
 Upon your lips the scarlet drops are found,  
 And in your eye, the boy that did the murder." <span
id="fr_916"></span>[1](#fn_913)</span>

</div>

   We may compare the expression, "to look babies in the eyes," a common
amusement of lovers in days gone by. In Beaumont and Fletcher's "Loyal
Subject" (iii. 2), Theodore asks—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">              "Can ye look babies, sisters,  
In the young gallants’ eyes, and twirl their band-strings?"</span>

</div>

And once more to quote from Massinger's "Renegado" (ii. 4), where Donusa
says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When a young lady wrings you by the hand, thus,  
 Or with an amorous touch presses your foot;  
 Looks babies in your eyes, plays with your locks." &c.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

   Another old term for the eyes was "crystal," which is used by Pistol
to his wife, Mrs Quickly, in "Henry V." (ii. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Therefore Caveto be thy counsellor.  
 Go, clear thy crystals;"</span>

</div>

that is, dry thine eyes.

   In "Romeo and Juliet" (i. 2), the phrase is employed by Benvolio:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,  
 Herself poised with herself in either eye:  
 But in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d  
 Your lady's love against some other maid," &c.</span>

</div>

   It also occurs in Beaumont and Fletcher's "Double Marriage" (v. 3),
where Juliana exclaims:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">               "Sleep you, sweet glasses!  
An everlasting slumber crown those crystals."</span>

</div>

   The expression "wall-eyed" denotes, says Dyce ("Glossary," p. 486),
"eyes with a white or pale-gray iris—glaring-eyed." It is used by Lucius
in "Titus Andronicus" (v. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey  
 This growing image of thy fiend-like face?"</span>

</div>

In "King John" (iv. 3), Salisbury speaks of "wall-eyed wrath."

   Brockett, in his "Glossary of North Country Words," says:—"In those
parts of the north with which I am best acquainted, persons are said to
be *wall-eyed* when the white of the eye is very large and to one side;
on the borders 'sic folks' are considered lucky. The term is also
occasionally applied to horses with similar eyes, though its wider
general acceptation seems to be when the iris of the eye is white, or of
a very pale colour. A *wall-eyed* horse sees perfectly well."

   *Face*.—A common expression "to play the hypocrite," or feign, was
"to face." So in "1 Henry VI." (v. 3), Suffolk declares how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">               "Fair Margaret knows  
That Suffolk does not flatter, face, or feign."</span>

</div>

Hence the name of one of the characters in Ben Jonson's "Alchemist." So
in the "Taming of the Shrew" (ii. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Yet have I faced it with a card of ten."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>

   The phrase, also, "to face me down," implied insisting upon anything
in opposition. So in the "Comedy of Errors" (iii.), Antipholus of
Ephesus says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But here's a villain that would face me down  
 He met me on the mart."</span>

</div>

   *Feet*.—Stumbling has from the earliest period been considered
ominous. <span id="fr_917"></span>[1](#fn_914) Thus Cicero mentions it
amongst the superstitions of his day; and numerous instances of this
unlucky act have been handed down from bygone times. We are told by Ovid
how Myrrha, on her way to Cinyra's chamber stumbled thrice, but was not
deterred by the omen from an unnatural and fatal crime; and Tibullus
(Lib. I., Eleg. iii. 20), refers to it:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O! quoties ingressus iter, mihi tristia dixi,  
          Offensum in porta signa dedisse pedem."</span>

</div>

   This superstition is alluded to by Shakespeare, who in "3 Henry VI."
(iv. 7) makes Gloucester say:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"For many men that stumble at the threshold  
 Are well foretold that danger lurks within."</span>

</div>

   In "Richard III." (iii. 4), Hastings relates:— <span
id="fr_918"></span>[2](#fn_915)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did
stumble  
 And startled, when he look’d upon the Tower,  
 As loath to bear me to the slaughter house."</span>

</div>

   In the same way, stumbling at a grave has been regarded as equally
unlucky, and in "Romeo and Juliet" (v. 3), Friar Laurence says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">               "How oft to-night  
Have my old feet stumbled at graves."</span>

</div>

   *Hair*.—From time immemorial there has been a strong antipathy to red
hair, which originated, according to some antiquarians, in a tradition
that Judas had hair of this colour.

<span id="page_455">p. 455</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> One reason, it may
be, why the dislike to it arose, was that this colour was considered
ugly and unfashionable, and on this account a person with red hair would
soon be regarded with contempt. It has been conjectured, too, that the
odium took its rise from the aversion to the red-haired Danes. In "As
You Like It" (iii. 4), Rosalind, when speaking of Orlando, refers to
this notion:— <span id="fr_919"></span>[1](#fn_916)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"His very hair is of the dissembling colour."</span>

</div>

Whereupon Celia replies:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Something browner than Judas's."</span>

</div>

   Yellow hair, too, was in years gone by regarded with ill-favour, and
esteemed a deformity. In ancient pictures and tapestries both Cain and
Judas are represented with yellow beards, in allusion to which Simple,
in the "Merry Wives of Windsor" (i. 4), when interrogated, says of his
master, "He hath but a little wee face, with a little yellow beard—a
Cain coloured beard." <span id="fr_920"></span>[2](#fn_917)

   In speaking of beards, it may be noted that formerly they gave rise
to various customs. Thus, in Shakespeare's day, dyeing beards was a
fashionable custom, and so Bottom, in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (i.
2), is perplexed as to what beard he should wear when acting before the
Duke. He says, "I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard,
your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French
crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow." <span
id="fr_921"></span>[3](#fn_918)

   To mutilate a beard in any way was considered an irreparable outrage,
a practice to which Hamlet refers (ii. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?  
 Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?"</span>

</div>

And in "King Lear" (iii. 7), Gloucester exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly done  
 To pluck me by the beard."</span>

</div>

   Stroking the beard before a person spoke was preparatory

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

to favour. Hence in "Troilus and Cressida" (i. 3), Ulysses, when
describing how Achilles asks Patroclus to imitate certain of their
chiefs, represents him as saying:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,  
 As he being drest to some oration."</span>

</div>

   Again, the phrase "to beard" meant to oppose face to face in a
hostile manner. Thus in "1 Henry IV." (iv. 1), Douglas declares:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"No man so potent breathes upon the ground  
 But I will beard him."</span>

</div>

And in "1 Henry VI." (i. 3), the Bishop of Winchester says to
Gloucester:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy
face."</span>

   It seems also to have been customary to swear by the beard, an
allusion to which is made by Touchstone in "As You Like It" (i.
2):—"Stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave."

   We may also compare what Nestor says in "Troilus and Cressida" (iv.
5):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By this white beard, I’ld fight with thee
to-morrow."</span>

</div>

   Our ancestors paid great attention to the shape of their beards,
certain cuts being appropriated to certain professions and ranks. In
"King Henry V." (iii. 6), Gower speaks of "a beard of the general's
cut." As Mr Staunton remarks, "Not the least odd among the fantastic
fashions of our forefathers was the custom of distinguishing certain
professions and classes by the cut of the beard; thus we hear, inter
alia, of the bishop's beard, the judge's beard, the soldier's beard, the
citizen's beard, and even the clown's beard." Randle Holme tells us,
"The broad or cathedral beard \[is\] so-called because bishops and
gown-men of the church anciently did wear such beards." By the military
man, the cut adopted was known as the stiletto or spade. The beard of
the citizen was usually worn round, as Mrs Quickly describes it in
"Merry Wives of Windsor" (i. 4), "like a glover's paring knife." The
clown's beard was left bushy or untrimmed.

<span id="page_457">p. 457</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Malone quotes from
an old ballad entitled "Le Prince d’ Amour," 1660:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Next the clown doth out-rush  
 With the beard of the bush."</span>

</div>

   According to an old superstition, much hair on the head has been
supposed to indicate an absence of intellect, a notion referred to by
Antipholus of Syracuse in the "Comedy of Errors" (ii. 2):—"There's many
a man hath more hair than wit." In the "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (iii.
1), the same proverbial sentence is mentioned by Speed. Malone quotes
the following lines upon Suckling's "Aglaura," as an illustration of
this saying <span id="fr_922"></span>[1](#fn_919):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This great voluminous pamphlet may be said  
 To be like one that hath more hair than head;  
 More excrement than body: trees which sprout  
 With broadest leaves have still the smallest fruit."</span>

</div>

   Steevens gives an example from "Florio":—"A tisty-tosty wag-feather,
more haire than wit."

   Excessive fear has been said to cause the hair to stand on end; an
instance of which Shakespeare records in "Hamlet" (iii. 4), in that
celebrated passage where the Queen, being at a loss to understand her
son's strange appearance during his conversation with the Ghost, which
is invisible to her, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,  
 Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,  
 Starts up, and stands an end."</span>

</div>

   A further instance occurs in the "Tempest" (i. 2), where Ariel,
describing the shipwreck, graphically relates how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "All but mariners  
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,  
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,  
With hair up-staring—then like reeds, not hair—  
Was the first man that leap’d."</span>

</div>

   Again, Macbeth says (i. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">     "Why do I yield to that suggestion  
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair?"</span>

</div>

<span id="page_458">p. 458</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And further on he
says (v. 5):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The time has been, my senses would have cool’d  
 To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair  
 Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in’t."</span>

</div>

   In "2 Henry VI." (iii. 2), it is referred to by Suffolk as a sign of
madness:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Mine hair be fix’d on end, as one distract."</span>

</div>

   And once more, in "King Richard III." (i. 3), Hastings declares

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Mine hair doth stand on end to hear her
curses."</span>

</div>

   Another popular notion, mentioned by Shakespeare, is that sudden
fright or great sorrow will cause the hair to turn white. In "1 Henry
IV." (ii. 4), Falstaff, in his speech to Prince Henry, tells him:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thy father's beard is turned white with the
news."</span>

</div>

   Among the many instances recorded to establish the truth of this
idea, it is said that the hair and beard of the Duke of Brunswick
whitened in twenty-four hours, upon his hearing that his father had been
mortally wounded in the battle of Auerstadt. Marie Antoinette, the
unfortunate queen of Louis XVI., found her hair suddenly changed by her
troubles; and a similar change happened to Charles I., when he attempted
to escape from Carisbroke Castle. Mr Timbs, in his "Doctors and
Patients" (1876, p. 201), says that "chemists have discovered that hair
contains an oil, a mucous substance, iron, oxide of manganese, phosphate
and carbonate of iron, flint, and a large proportion of sulphur. White
hair contains also phosphate of magnesia, and its oil is nearly
colourless. When hair becomes suddenly white from terror, it is probably
owing to the sulphur absorbing the oil, as in the operation of whitening
woollen cloths."

   Hair was formerly used metaphorically for the colour, complexion, or
nature of a thing. In "1 Henry IV." (iv. 1), Worcester says

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">     "I would your father had been here,  
The quality and hair of our attempt  
Brooks no division."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_459">p. 459</span>

   In Beaumont and Fletcher's "Nice Valour," it is so used:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A lady of my hair cannot want pitying."</span>

</div>

   *Hands*.—Various superstitions have at different times clustered
round the hand. Thus in palmistry a moist one is said to denote an
amorous constitution. In "Othello" (iii. 4), we have the following
allusion to this popular notion

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Othello*. Give me your hand: this hand is moist,
my lady.  
 *Desdemona*. It yet have felt no age nor known no sorrow.  
 *Othello*. This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart."</span>

</div>

Again in "Antony and Cleopatra" (i. 2), Iras says—"There's a palm
presages chastity;" whereupon Charmian adds—"If an oily palm be not a
fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear." And in the "Comedy
of Errors" (iii. 2), Dromio of Syracuse speaks of barrenness as "hard in
the palm of the hand."

   A dry hand, however, has been supposed to denote age and debility. In
"2 Henry IV." (i. 2), the Lord Chief Justice enumerates this amongst the
characteristics of such a constitution. <span
id="fr_923"></span>[1](#fn_920)

   In the "Merchant of Venice" (ii. 2), Launcelot, referring to the
language of palmistry, calls the hand "the table," meaning thereby the
whole collection of lines on the skin, within the hand:—"Well, if any
man in Italy hath a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book,
I shall have good fortune." He then alludes to one of the lines in the
hand, known as the "line of life:"—"Go to, here's a simple line of
life."

   In the "Two Noble Kinsmen" (iii. 5), palmistry is further mentioned:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Gaoler's Daughter*. Give me your hand.  
 *Gerrold*. Why?  
 *Gaoler's Daughter*. I can tell your fortune."</span>

</div>

   It was once supposed that little worms were bred in the fingers of
idle servants. To this notion Mercutio refers in "Romeo and Juliet" (i.
4), where, in his description of Queen Mab, he says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat,  
 Not half so big as a round little worm  
 Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_460">p. 460</span>

   This notion is alluded to by John Banister, a famous surgeon in
Shakespeare's day, in his "Compendious Chyrurgerie" (1585, p. 465):—"We
commonly call them worms, which many women, sitting in the sunshine, can
cunningly picke out with needles, and are most common in the handes."

   A popular term formerly in use for the nails on the ten fingers was
the "ten commandments," which, says Nares, <span
id="fr_924"></span>[1](#fn_921) "doubtless led to the swearing by them,
as by the real commandments." Thus, in "2 Henry VI." (i. 3), the Duchess
of Gloucester says to the Queen:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Could I come near your beauty with my nails  
 I’ld set my ten commandments in your face."</span>

</div>

   In the same way the fingers were also called the "ten bones," as a
little further on in the same play where Peter swears "by these ten
bones."

   The phrase "of his hands" was equivalent to "of his inches, or of his
size; a hand being the measure of four inches." So in the "Merry Wives
of Windsor" (i. 4), Simple says:—"Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man
of his hands as any is between this and his head," "the expression being
used probably for the sake of a jocular equivocation in the word tall,
which meant either bold or high." <span id="fr_925"></span>[2](#fn_922)

   Again, in the "Winter's Tale" (v. 2), the Clown tells the
Shepherd:—"I'll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands
and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall fellow of
thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk; but I'll swear it, and I would
thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands."

   A proverbial phrase for being tall from necessity was "to blow the
nail." In "3 Henry VI." (ii. 5), the King says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When dying clouds contend with growing light  
 What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,  
 Can neither call it perfect day or night."</span>

</div>

It occurs in the song at the end of "Love's Labour's Lost":—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And Dick the shepherd blows his nails."</span>

</div>

   "To bite the thumb" at a person implied an insult; hence

<span id="page_461">p. 461</span>

in "Romeo and Juliet" (i. 1), Sampson says:—"I will bite my thumb at
them; which is a disgrace to them, if they hear it."

The thumb in this action we are told "represented a fig, and the whole
was equivalent to a fig for you." <span id="fr_926"></span>[1](#fn_923)
Decker in his "Dead Term" (1608), speaking of the various groups that
daily frequented St Pauls’ Church, says:—"What swearing is there, what
shouldering, what justling, what jeering, what byting of thumbs, to
beget quarrels?"

   *Hare-lip*.—A cleft lip so called from its supposed resemblance to
the upper lip of a hare. It was popularly believed to be the mischievous
act of an elf or malicious fairy. So in "King Lear" (iii. 4), Edgar says
of Gloucester:—"This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet:—He squints the
eye and makes the hare-lip." In the "Midsummer Night's Dream" (v. 2),
Oberon, in blessing the bridal bed of Theseus and Hippolyta,
says:—"Never mole, hare lip, nor scar," &c., "shall upon their children
be."

   The expression "hang the lip" meant to drop the lip in sullenness or
contempt. Thus in "Troilus and Cressida" (iii. 1), Helen explains why
her brother Troilus is not abroad by saying:—"He hangs the lip at
something." We may compare, too, the words in "1 Henry IV." (ii. 4):—"A
foolish hanging of thy nether lip."

   *Head*—According to the old writers on physiognomy, a round head
denoted foolishness, a notion to which reference is made by "Cleopatra"
(iii. 3), in the following dialogue, who enquiring about Octavia, says
to the messenger—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">           "Bear’st thou her face in mind? Is’t long
or round?  
Messenger. Round even to faultiness.  
Cleopatra. For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so."</span>

</div>

In Hill's "Pleasant History," etc. (1613) we read:—"The head very round,
to be forgetful and foolish." Again—"The head long, to be prudent and
wary."

   *Heart*.—The term "broken heart" as commonly applied to death from
excessive grief, is not a vulgar error, but may

<span id="page_462">p. 462</span>

arise from violent muscular exertion, or strong mental emotions. In
"Macbeth" (iv. 3) Malcolm says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                "The grief that does not speak  
Whispers the o’er fraught heart and bids it break."</span>

</div>

We may compare, too, Queen Margaret's words to Buckingham in "King
Richard III." (i. 3) where she prophesies how Gloucester—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Shall split thy very heart with sorrow."</span>

</div>

   Mr Timbs, in his "Mysteries of Life, Death, and Futurity" (1861, p.
149), has given the following note on the subject "This affection was,
it is believed, first described by Harvey; but since his day several
cases have been observed. Morgagni has recorded a few examples: amongst
them, that of George II., who died suddenly of this disease in 1760;
and, what is very curious, Morgagni himself fell a victim to the same
malady. Dr Elliotson, in his Lumleyan Lectures on Diseases of the Heart
in 1839, stated that he had only seen one instance; but in the
'Cyclopædia of Practical Medicine,' Dr Townsend gives a table of
twenty-five cases, collected from various authors."

   In olden times the heart was esteemed the seat of the understanding.
Hence in "Coriolanus" (i. 1) the Citizen speaks of "the counsellor
heart." With the ancients, also, the heart was considered the seat of
courage, to which Shakespeare refers in "Julius Cæsar" (iii 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Ser*. Plucking the entrails of an offering forth  
 They could not find a heart within the beast.  
 *Cæs*. The gods do this in shame of cowardice:  
 Cæsar should be a beast without a heart,  
 If he should stay at home to-day for fear."</span>

</div>

   *Liver*.—By a popular notion the liver was anciently supposed to be
the seat of love, a superstition to which Shakespeare frequently
alludes. Thus, in "Love's Labour's Lost" (iv. 3), Biron, after listening
to Longaville's sonnet, remarks:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a
deity,  
 A green goose a goddess; pure, pure idolatry."</span>

</div>

In "Much ado about Nothing" (iv. 1), Friar Francis says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"If ever love had interest in his liver."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_463">p. 463</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Again, in "As You
Like It" (iii. 2), Rosalind professing to be able to cure love, which,
he says, is "merely a madness," says to Orlando, "I will take upon me to
wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart, that there shall not
be one spot of love in’t." In "Twelfth Night" (ii. 4), the Duke,
speaking of women's love, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Their love may be call’d appetite,  
 No motion of the liver, but the palate," &c.</span>

</div>

And Fabian (ii. 5), alluding to Olivia's supposed letter to Malvolio,
says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"This wins him, liver and all."</span>

</div>

Once more, in "Merry Wives of Windsor" (ii. 1), Pistol alludes to the
liver as being the inspirer of amorous passions, for, speaking of
Falstaff, he refers to his loving Ford's wife "with liver burning
hot." <span id="fr_927"></span>[1](#fn_924) Douce says, <span
id="fr_928"></span>[2](#fn_925) "there is some reason for thinking that
this superstition was borrowed from the Arabian physicians, or at least
adopted by them; for in the Turkish tales, an amorous tailor is made to
address his wife by the titles of 'thou corner of my liver, and soul of
my love;' and in another place the King of Syria, who had sustained a
temporary privation of his mistress, is said to have had 'his liver,
which had been burnt up by the loss of her, cooled and refreshed at the
sight of her.'" According to an old Latin distich—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Cor sapit, pulmo loquitur, fel commoret iras  
 Splen ridere facit, cogit amare jecur."</span>

</div>

Bartholomæus in his "De Proprietatibus Rerum" (lib. v. 39), informs us
that "the liver is the place of voluptuousness and lyking of the flesh."

   *Moles*.—These have from time immemorial been regarded as ominous,
and special attention has been paid by the superstitious to their
position on the body. <span id="fr_929"></span>[3](#fn_926) In "A
Midsummer

<span id="page_464">p. 464</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Night's Dream" (v.
1), a mole on a child is spoken of by Oberon as a bad omen, who,
speaking of the three who had lately been married, says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And the blots of Nature's hand  
 Shall not in their issue stand;  
 Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,  
 Nor mark prodigious, such as are  
 Despised in nativity,  
 Shall upon their children be."</span>

</div>

Iachimo ("Cymbeline," ii. 2) represents Imogene as having—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                        "On her left breast  
A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops  
I’ the bottom of a cowslip."</span>

</div>

And we may also compare the words of Cymbeline (v. 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                        "Guiderius had  
Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;  
It was a mark of wonder."</span>

</div>

   *Spleen*.—This was once supposed to be the cause of laughter, a
notion probably referred to by Isabella in "Measure for Measure" (ii.
2), where, telling how the angels weep over the follies of men she adds—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "Who, with our spleens,  
Would all themselves laugh mortal."</span>

</div>

In "Taming of the Shrew" (Induction, sc. i.), the lord says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                      "Haply my presence  
May well abate the over-merry spleen  
Which otherwise would grow into extremes."</span>

</div>

And Maria says to Sir Toby in "Twelfth Night" (iii. 2):—"If you desire
the spleen, and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me."

   *Wits*.—With our early writers, the five senses were usually called
the "five wits." So, in "Much ado about Nothing" (i. 1), Beatrice
says:—"In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
now is the whole man governed with one." In his 141st Sonnet,
Shakespeare makes a distinction between wits and senses—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But my five wits nor my five senses can  
 Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_465">p. 465</span>

   The five wits, says Staunton, being "common wit, imagination,
fantasy, estimation, memory." Johnson says the "wits seem to have been
reckoned five, by analogy to the five senses, or the five inlets of
ideas." In "King Lear" (iii. 4), we find the expression, "Bless thy five
wits."

   According to a curious fancy, eating beef was supposed to impair the
intellect, to which notion Shakespeare has several allusions. Thus, in
"Twelfth Night" (i. 3), Sir Andrew says—"Methinks sometimes I have no
more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a great eater
of beef and I believe, that does harm to my wit." In "Troilus and
Cressida" (ii. 1), Thersites says to Ajax—"The plague of Greece upon
thee, thou mongrel beef-witted lord!"
