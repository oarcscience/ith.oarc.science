### CHAPTER XV.

#### RINGS AND PRECIOUS STONES.

<span class="smallcaps">From</span> a very early period, rings and
precious stones have held a prominent place in the traditionary lore,
customs, and superstitions of most nations. Thus rings have been
supposed "to protect from evil fascinations of every kind, against the
evil eye, the influence of demons, and dangers of every possible
character; though it was not simply in the rings themselves that the
supposed virtues existed, but in the materials of which they were
composed,—in some particular precious stone that was set in them as
charms or talismans, in some device or inscription on the stone, or some
magical letters engraved on the circumference of the ring." <span
id="fr_759"></span>[1](#fn_757.md) Rings, too, in days gone by, had a
symbolical importance. Thus, it was anciently the custom for every
monarch to have a ring, the temporary possession of which invested the
holder with the same authority as the owner himself could exercise.
Thus, in "Henry VIII.," (v. 1), we have the king's ring given to
Cranmer, and presented by him (sc. 2), as a security against the
machinations of Gardiner and others of the Council, who were plotting to
destroy him. Thus the King says,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                        "If entreaties  
Will render you no remedy, this ring  
Deliver them, and your appeal to us  
There make before them."</span>

</div>

   This custom, too, was not confined to royalty, for in "King Richard
II.," (ii. 2), the Duke of York gives this order to his servant,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister
Gloucester;  
 Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:  
 Hold, take my ring.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

   There is an interesting relic of the same custom still kept up at
Winchester College. <span id="fr_760"></span>[1](#fn_758.md) When the
captain of the school petitions the head-master for a holiday, and
obtains it, he receives from him a ring, in token of the indulgence
granted, which he wears during the holiday, and returns to the
headmaster when it is over. The inscription upon the ring was formerly
"Potentiam fero, geroque." It is now "Commendat rarior usus," (Juvenal,
Sat. xi. 208).

   *Token Rings* date from very early times. Edward the First in 1297
presented Margaret, his fourth daughter, with a golden pyx, in which he
deposited a ring, as a token of his unfailing love.

   When Richard III. (i. 2), brings his hasty wooing to a conclusion, he
gives the Lady Anne a ring, saying,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Look, how this ring encompasseth thy finger,  
 Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;  
 Wear both of them, for both of them are thine."</span>

</div>

   In "Cymbeline," (i. 1), Imogen gives Posthumus a ring when they part,
and he presents her with a bracelet in exchange,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                          "Look here, love;  
This diamond was my mother's; take it, heart;  
But keep it till you woo another wife,  
When Imogen is dead.  
*Posthumus*. How! how! another?  
You gentle gods, give me but this I have,  
And sear up my embracements from a next  
With bonds of death! Remain, remain, thou here,  
                                    (*Putting on the ring*.)  
While sense can keep it on."</span>

</div>

   Yet he afterwards gives it up to Iachimo (ii. 4)—upon a false
representation—to test his wife's honour,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Here, take this too;  
 It is a basilisk unto my eye,  
 Kills me to look on’t."</span>

</div>

   The exchange of rings, a solemn mode of private contract between
lovers, we have already referred to in the chapter on Marriage,—a
practice alluded to in the "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (ii. 2) where Julia
gives Proteus a ring, saying—"Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's
sake"; and he replies, "Why, then we'll make exchange: here, take you
this."

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

   *Death's-head rings*.—Rings engraved with skulls and skeletons were
not necessarily mourning rings, but were also worn by persons who
affected gravity; and, curious to say, by the procuresses of Elizabeth's
time. Biron, in "Love's Labour's Lost" (v. 2), refers to "a death's face
in a ring;" and we may quote Falstaff's words in "2 Henry IV." (ii.
4)—"Peace, good Doll! do not speak like a death's head; do not bid me
remember mine end." We may compare the following, "The Chances" (i. 5),
by Beaumont and Fletcher:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"As they keep deaths’ heads in rings,  
 To cry 'memento' to me."</span>

</div>

According to Mr Fairholt, "the skull and skeleton decorations for rings
first came into favour and fashion at the obsequious Court of France,
when Diana, of Poictiers, became the mistress of Henry the Second. At
that time she was a widow, and in mourning, so black and white became
fashionable colours; jewels were formed like funeral memorials; golden
ornaments shaped like coffins, holding enamelled skeletons, hung from
the neck; watches, made to fit in little silver skulls were attached to
the waists of the denizens of a court that alternately indulged in
profanity or piety, but who mourned show." <span
id="fr_761"></span>[1](#fn_759.md)

   *Posy-rings* were formerly much used—it having been customary to
inscribe a motto or "posy" within the hoop of the betrothal ring. <span
id="fr_762"></span>[2](#fn_760.md)\* Thus in the "Merchant of Venice" (v.
1), Gratiano, when asked by Portia the reason of his quarrel with
Nerissa, answers—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring  
 That she did give me, whose posy was  
 For all the world like cutler's poetry  
 Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'"</span>

</div>

In "As You Like It" (iii. 2), Jaques tells Orlando "you are full of
pretty answers. Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths’ wives, and
conned them out of rings?"

   Again, Hamlet (iii. 2), asks

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?"</span>

</div>

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Many of our old
writers allude to the "posy-rings." Thus Herrick in his "Hesperides,"
says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What posies for our wedding rings,  
 What gloves we'll give and ribbonings."</span>

</div>

Henry VIII. gave Anne of Cleves a ring with the following posy—"God send
me well to kepe," a most unpropitious alliance, as the king expressed
his dislike to her soon after the marriage.

   *Thumb-rings*.—These were generally broad gold rings worn on the
thumb by important personages. Thus Falstaff ("1 Henry IV." ii. 4),
bragged that in his earlier years he had been so slender in figure as to
"creep into an alderman's thumb-ring;" and a ring thus worn—probably as
more conspicuous—appears to have been considered as appropriate to the
customary attire of a civic dignitary at a much later period. A
character in the Lord Mayor Show in 1664 is described as 'habited like a
grave citizen—gold girdle and gloves hung thereon, rings on his fingers,
and a seal ring on his thumb.'" <span id="fr_763"></span>[1](#fn_761.md)
Chaucer in his "Squire's Tale," says of the rider of the brazen horse
who advanced into the hall, Cambuscan, that "upon his thumb he had of
gold a ring." In "Romeo and Juliet" (i. 4), Mercutio speaks of the—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "Agate stone  
On the forefinger of an alderman."</span>

</div>

It has been suggested that Shakespeare in the following passage alludes
to the annual celebration at Venice of the wedding of the Doge with the
Adriatic, when he makes Othello say (i. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But that I love the gentle Desdemona,  
 I would not my unhoused free condition  
 Put into circumscription and confine  
 For the sea's worth."</span>

</div>

This custom, it is said, was instituted by Pope Alexander III., who gave
the doge a gold ring from his own finger in token of the victory by the
Venetian fleet at Istria over Frederick Barbarossa, in defence of the
Pope's quarrel. When his holiness gave the ring, he desired the doge to
throw a similar

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

ring into the sea every year on Ascension Day, in commemoration of the
event.

   *Agate*.—This stone was frequently cut to represent the human form,
and was occasionally worn in the hat by gallants. In "2 Henry IV." (i.
2), Falstaff says, "I was never manned with an agate till now," meaning,
according to Johnson, "had an agate for my man;" was waited on by an
agate.

   *Carbuncle*.—The supernatural lustre of this gem <span
id="fr_764"></span>[1](#fn_762.md) is supposed to be described in "Titus
Andronicus" (ii. 3), where, speaking of the ring on the finger of
Bassianus, Martius says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Upon his bloody finger he doth wear  
 A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,  
 Which, like a taper in some monument,  
 Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,  
 And shows the ragged entrails of the pit."</span>

</div>

   In Drayton's "Muses’ Elysium" ("Nymphal," ix.), it is thus eulogised—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"That admired mighty stone,  
   The carbuncle that's named,  
 Which from it such a flaming light  
   And radiancy ejecteth—  
 That in the very darkest night  
   The eye to it directeth."</span>

</div>

   Milton, speaking of the cobra, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "His head  
Crested aloof, and carbuncle his eyes."</span>

</div>

   John Norton, <span id="fr_765"></span>[2](#fn_763.md) an alchemist in
the reign of Edward IV., wrote a poem entitled the "Ordinal," or a
manual of the chemical art. One of his projects, we are told, was a
bridge of gold over the Thames, crowned with pinnacles of gold, which,
being studded with carbuncles, would diffuse a blaze of light in the
dark. Amongst the other references to it given by Shakespeare may be
mentioned one in "Henry VIII." (ii. 3), where the Princess Elizabeth is
spoken of as—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">              "A gem  
To lighten all this isle."</span>

</div>

And Hamlet (ii. 2) uses the phrase, "With eyes like carbuncles."

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

   *Chrysolite*.—This stone was supposed to possess peculiar virtues,
and, according to Simon Maiolus, in his "Dierum Caniculares" (1615–19),
Thetel the Jew, who wrote a book, "De Sculpturiis," mentions one
naturally in the form of a woman, which was potent against fascination
of all kinds. Othello (v. 2) thus alludes to this stone in reference to
his wife—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                      "Nay, had she been true,  
If heaven could make me such another world  
Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,  
I’ld not have sold her for it."</span>

</div>

   *Pearls*.—The eastern custom of powdering sovereigns at their
coronation with gold dust and seed pearl is alluded to in "Antony and
Cleopatra" <span id="fr_766"></span>[1](#fn_764) (ii. 5.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail  
 Rich pearls upon thee."</span>

</div>

   So Milton ("Paradise Lost," ii. 4):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The gorgeous east, with liberal hand  
 Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold."</span>

</div>

   Again, to swallow a pearl in a draught seems to have been common to
royal and mercantile prodigality. In "Hamlet" (v. 2), the King says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;  
 And in the cup an union <span id="fr_767"></span>[2](#fn_765.md) shall he
throw."</span>

</div>

   Further on Hamlet himself asks, tauntingly—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Here, thou incestuous, murdrous, damned Dane,  
 Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?"</span>

</div>

   Malone, as an illustration of this custom, quotes from the second
part of Heywood's "If You Know Not Me You Know Nobody"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Here sixteen thousand pound at one clap goes  
 Instead of sugar. Gresham drinks this pearl  
 Unto the queen his mistress."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

   In former times, powdered pearls were considered invaluable for
stomach complaints; and Rondeletius tells us that they were supposed to
possess an exhilarating quality—"Uniones quæ a conchis, et valde
cordiales sunt."

   Much mystery was in bygone days thought to hang over the origin of
pearls, and according to the poetic Orientals, <span
id="fr_768"></span>[1](#fn_766.md) "Every year, on the sixteenth day of the
month Nisan, the pearl oysters rise to the sea and open their shells, in
order to receive the rain which falls at that time, and the drops thus
caught become pearls." Thus, in "Richard III." (iv. 4), the king says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The liquid drops of tears that you have shed  
 Shall come again, transform’d to orient pearl,  
 Advantaging their loan with interest  
 Of ten times double gain of happiness."</span>

</div>

Moore, in one of his melodies, notices this pretty notion—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And precious the tear as that rain from the sky  
 Which turns into pearls as it falls in the sea."</span>

</div>

   *Turquoise*.—This stone was probably more esteemed for its secret
virtues than from any commercial value; the turquoise, turkise, or
turkey-stone, having from a remote period, been supposed to possess
talismanic properties. Thus, in the "Merchant of Venice" (iii. 1),
Shylock says:—"It was my turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a
bachelor: I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys." Mr
Dyce <span id="fr_769"></span>[2](#fn_767.md) says that Shylock valued his
torquoise, "not only as being the gift of Leah, but on account of the
imaginary virtues ascribed to it; which was supposed to become pale or
to brighten according as the health of the wearer was bad or good."
Thus, Ben Jonson in "Sejanus" (i. 1), alludes to its wonderful
properties—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And true as turkoise in the dear lord's ring,  
 Look well or ill with him."</span>

</div>

   Fenton, in his "Certain Secret Wonders of Nature" (1569), thus
describes it:—"The turkeys doth move when there is any

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

evil prepared to him that weareth it." There were numerous other magical
properties ascribed to the turquoise. Thus, it was supposed to lose its
colour entirely at the death of its owner, but to recover it when placed
upon the finger of a new and healthy possessor. It was also said that
whoever wore a turquoise, so that either it or its setting touched the
skin, might fall from any height; the stone attracting to itself the
whole force of the blow. With the Germans, the turquoise is still the
gem appropriated to the ring, the "gage d’amour," presented by the lover
on the acceptance of his suit, the permanence of its colour being
believed to depend upon the constancy of his affection. <span
