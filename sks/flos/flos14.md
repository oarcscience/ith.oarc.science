### CHAPTER XII.

#### BIRTH AND BAPTISM.

<span class="smallcaps">As</span> every period of human life has its
peculiar rites and ceremonies, its customs and superstitions, so has
that ever all-eventful hour which heralds the birth of a fresh actor
upon the world's great stage. From the cradle to the grave, through all
the successive epochs of man's existence, we find a series of
traditional beliefs and popular notions, which have been handed down to
us from the far-off distant past. Although, indeed, these have lost much
of their meaning in the lapse of years, yet in many cases they are
survivals of primitive culture, and embody the conceptions of the
ancestors of the human race. Many of these have been recorded by
Shakespeare, who, acting upon the great principle of presenting his
audience with matters familiar to them, has given numerous illustrations
of the manners and superstitions of his own country, as they existed in
his day. Thus, in "Richard III.," (iii. 1), when he represents the Duke
of Gloucester saying

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"So wise so young, they say, do never live
long"</span>

</div>

he alludes to the old superstition, still deeply rooted in the minds of
the lower orders, that a clever child never lives long. In Bright's
"Treatise of Melancholy," (1586, p. 52), we read,—"I have knowne
children languishing of the splene, obstructed and altered in temper,
talke with gravity and wisdom surpassing those tender years, and their
judgments carrying a marvellous imitation of the wisdome of the ancient,
having after a sort attained that by disease, which others have by
course of yeares; whereof I take it the proverb ariseth, that 'they be
of shorte life who are of wit so pregnant.'" There are sundry
superstitious notions relating to

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

the teething of children prevalent in our own and other countries. In "3
Henry VI.," (v. 6), the Duke of Gloucester, alluding to the
peculiarities connected with his birth relates how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The midwife wonder’d, and the women cried  
 'O, Jesu bless us, he is born with teeth!'  
 And so I was; which plainly signified  
 That I should snarl and bite and play the dog."</span>

</div>

   It is still believed, for instance, in many places, that if a child's
first tooth appears in the upper jaw, it is an omen of its dying in
infancy; and when the teeth come early, it is regarded as indication
that there will soon be another baby. In Sussex there is a dislike to
throwing away the cast teeth of children, from a notion that should they
be found and gnawed by any animal, the child's new tooth would be
exactly like the animal's that had bitten the old one. In Durham, when
the first teeth come out, the cavities must be filled with salt, and
each tooth burned, while the following words are repeated,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Fire, fire, burn bone,  
 God send me my tooth again."</span>

</div>

   In the above passage, then, Shakespeare simply makes the Duke of
Gloucester refer to that extensive folk-lore associated with human
birth, showing how careful an observer he was in noticing the whims and
oddities of his countrymen.

   Again, one of the foremost dangers supposed to hover round the new
born infant, was the propensity of witches and fairies, to steal the
most beautiful and well-favoured children, and to leave in their places
such as were ugly and stupid. These were usually called "changelings."
Shakespeare alludes to this notion in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (ii.
1), where Puck says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Because that she as her attendant hath  
 A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;  
 She never had so sweet a changeling."</span>

</div>

And further on in the same scene Oberon says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I do but beg a little changeling boy  
 To be my henchman."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

   As a fairy is in each case the speaker, the changeling in this case
denotes the child taken by them. So, too, in the "Winter's Tale" (iii.
3), in the passage where the shepherd relates:—"It was told me I should
be rich by the fairies: This is some changeling open’t." As the child
here found was a beautiful one, the changeling must naturally mean the
child stolen by the fairies, especially as the gold left with it, is
conjectured to be fairy gold. The usual signification, however, of the
term *changeling*, is thus marked by Spenser ("Faerie Queene" I. x.
65):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"From thence a faery thee unweeting reft,  
 There as thou slepst in tender swadling band,  
 And her base elfin brood there for thee left:  
 Such men do chaungelings call, so chaunged by faeries theft."</span>

</div>

   Occasionally, fairies played pranks with new-born children by
exchanging them. To this notion Henry the Fourth refers ("1 Henry IV."
i. 1), when, speaking of Hotspur compared with his own profligate son,
he exclaims:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "O that it could be proved  
That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged  
In cradle clothes our children where they lay  
And call’d mine Percy, his Plantagenet."</span>

</div>

   To induce the fairies to restore the stolen child, it was customary
in Ireland, either to put the one supposed of being a changeling on a
hot shovel, or to torment it in some other way. It seems that, in
Denmark, the mother heats the oven, and places the changeling on the
peel, pretending to put it in, or whips it severely with a rod, or
throws it into the water. In the Western Isles of Scotland, idiots are
supposed to be the fairies’ changelings, and, in order to regain the
lost child, parents have recourse to the following device. They place
the changeling on the beach, below high-water mark, when the tide is
out, and pay no heed to its screams, believing that the fairies, rather
than suffer their offspring to be drowned by the rising water, will
convey it away and restore the child they had stolen. The sign that this
has been done is the cessation of the child's screaming. The most
effectual preservative, however, against fairy influence

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

is supposed to be baptism, and hence among the superstitious this rite
is performed as soon as possible.

   A form of superstition very common in days gone by was the supposed
influence of the "Evil eye;" being designated by the terms "o’erlooked,"
"forelooked," or "eye-bitten," certain persons being thought to possess
the power of inflicting injury by merely looking on those whom they
wished to harm. Even the new-born child was not exempt from this danger,
and various charms were practised to avert it. In the "Merry Wives of
Windsor" (v. 5), Pistol says of Falstaff—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Vile worm, thou wast o’erlook’d even at thy
birth."</span>

</div>

This piece of folk-lore may be traced back to the time of the Romans,
and in the late Professor Conington's translation of the "Satires of
Persius" it is thus spoken of:—"Look here! a grandmother or a
superstitious aunt has taken baby from his cradle, and is charming his
forehead against mischief by the joint action of her middle-finger and
her purifying spittle; for she knows right well how to check the evil
eye." <span id="fr_707"></span>[1](#fn_705.md) It is again alluded to in
the "Merchant of Venice" (iii. 2), where Portia, expressing to Bassanio
her feelings of regard, declares:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "Beshrew your eyes,  
They have o’erlooked me and divided me:  
One half of me is yours, the other half yours."</span>

</div>

and in "Titus Andronicus" (ii. 1), Aaron speaks of Tamora as—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes  
 Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus."</span>

</div>

This superstition, however, is not yet obsolete, but lingers on in many
country places.

   We may also compare a similar phrase made use of by "Cleopatra" (iii.
7), in answer to Enobarbus:—"Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,"
the word *forespeak* having anciently had the meaning of charm or
bewitch, like *forbid* in "Macbeth" (i. 3); "he shall live a man
forbid." <span id="fr_708"></span>[2](#fn_706.md)

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

   Among the numerous customs associated with the birth of a child, may
be mentioned the practice of giving presents at the announcement of this
important event. In "King Henry VIII." (v. 1), on the old lady's making
known to the king the happy tidings of the birth of a princess, he says
to Lovell:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the
queen."</span>

</div>

The old lady, however, resents what she considers a paltry sum:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"An hundred marks! By this light I'll ha’ more.  
 An ordinary groom is for such payment.  
 I will have more, or scold it out of him."</span>

</div>

   It was an ancient custom—one which is not quite out of use—for the
sponsors at christenings to offer silver or gilt spoons as a present to
the child. These were called "apostle spoons," because the extremity of
the handle was formed into the figure of one or other of the apostles.
Such as were opulent and generous gave the whole twelve; those who were
moderately rich or liberal escaped at the expense of the four
evangelists, or even sometimes contented themselves with presenting one
spoon only, which exhibited the figure of any saint, in honour of whom
the child received its name. In "King Henry VIII." (v. 2), it is in
allusion to this custom that, when Cranmer professes to be unworthy of
being a sponsor to the young princess, Shakespeare makes the king reply—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Come, come, my lord, you’ld spare your
spoons."</span>

</div>

   A story is related of Shakespeare promising spoons to one of Ben
Jonson's children in a collection of anecdotes, entitled "Merry Passages
and Jests," compiled by Sir Nicholas L’Estrange (MSS. Harl.
6395):—"Shakespeare was godfather to one of Ben Jonson's children, and
after the christ’ning, being in a deepe study, Jonson came to cheere him
up, and ask’t him why he was so melancholy. 'No faith, Ben (sayes he),
not I; but I have been considering a great while what should be the
fittest gift for me to bestow upon my godchild, and I have resolv’d at
last.' 'I pr’y thee, what?' sayes he. 'I’ faith, Ben, I’le e’en give him
a douzen good Latin spoones,

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

and thou shalt translate them.'" "Shakespeare," says Mr Thoms, <span
id="fr_709"></span>[1](#fn_707.md) "willing to show his wit, if not his
wealth, gave a dozen spoons, not of silver, but of latten, a name
formerly used to signify a mixed metal resembling brass, as being the
most appropriate gift to the child of a father so learned." In
Middleton's "Chaste Maid of Cheapside," 1620—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*2 Goss.* What has he given her? What is it,
gossip?  
 *3 Goss.* A fair, high-standing cup, and two great ’postle spoons, one
of them gilt."</span>

</div>

And Beaumont and Fletcher in the "Noble Gentleman" (v. I)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll be a gossip, Beaufort,  
 I have an odd apostle spoon."</span>

</div>

   The gossip's feast, held in honour of those who were associated in
the festivities of a christening, was a very ancient English custom, and
is frequently mentioned by dramatists of the Elizabethan age. The term
gossip or godsip, a Saxon word signifying *cognata ex parte dei*, or
godmother, is well defined by Richard Verstegan, in his "Restitution of
Decayed Intelligence." He says: "Our Christian ancestors, understanding
a spiritual affinity to grow between the parents and such as undertooke
for the child at baptism, called each other by the name of *godsib*,
which is as much as to say that they were *sib* together, that is, of
*kin* together through God. And the childe, in like manner, called such
his godfathers or godmothers."

   As might be expected, it is often alluded to by Shakespeare. Thus, in
the "Comedy of Errors" (v. 1), we read—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Abbess*. Thirty-three years have I but gone in
travail  
 Of you, my sons: and till this present hour  
 My heavy burthen ne’er delivered.  
 The duke, my husband and my children both,  
 And you the calendars of their nativity,  
 Go to a gossip's feast, and go with me;  
 After so long grief, such festivity!  
 *Duke*. With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And again in "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" (ii. 1), the mischievous Puck says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,  
 In very likeness of a roasted crab,  
 And when she drinks, against her lips I bob  
 And on her wither’d dewlap pour the ale."</span>

</div>

And once more, we find Capulet in "Romeo and Juliet" (iii. 5), saying to
the Nurse:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">            "Peace, you mumbling fool!  
Utter your gravity o’er a gossip's bowl;  
For here we need it not."</span>

</div>

Referring to entertainments at christenings, we find the following in
the "Batchelor's Banquet," 1603 \[attributed to Dekker\]:—"What cost and
trouble it will be to have all things fine against the Christening Day;
what store of sugar, biskets, comphets, and caraways, marmalet, and
marchpane, with all kinds of sweet-suckers and superfluous banqueting
stuff, with a hundred other odd and needless trifles, which at that time
must fill the pockets of dainty dames," by which it appears the ladies
not only eat what they pleased, but pocketed likewise. Upon this and the
falling off of the custom of giving "apostle spoons" at the christening,
we read in "Shipman's Gossip," 1666:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Especially since gossips now  
 Eat more at christenings than bestow.  
 Formerly when they us’d to troul  
 Gilt bowls of sack, they gave the bowl;  
 Two spoons at least; an use ill kept;  
 ’Tis well now if our own be left."</span>

</div>

Strype tells us that in 1559 the son of Sir Thomas Chamberlayne was
baptised at St. Benet's Church, Paul's Wharf, when "the Church was hung
with cloth of arras, and after the christening were brought wafers,
comfits, and divers banqueting dishes, and hypocras and Muscadine wine,
to entertain the guests."

   "In Henry VIII." (v. 4), the Porter says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Do you look for ale and cakes here, you rude
rascals?"</span>

</div>

A term formerly in use for the name given at baptism was

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Christendom;" an
allusion to which we find in "All's well that ends Well" (i. 1) where
Helena says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                 "With a world  
Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms  
That blinking Cupid gossips,"</span>

</div>

the meaning evidently being a number of pretty fond adopted appellations
or christian names to which blind Cupid stands godfather. The expression
is often used for baptism by old writers; and Singer <span
id="fr_710"></span>[1](#fn_708) quotes from "King John" (iv. 1.md):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">          "By my christendom,  
So I were out of prison and kept sheep,  
I should be merry as the day is long."</span>

</div>

   Steevens observes that in the puritanical times it was usual to
christen children from the titles of moral and religious virtues—a
practice to which allusion seems to be made in the "Tempest" (ii. 1), by
Antonio:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Temperance was a delicate wench."</span>

</div>

So Taylor, the water-poet, in his description of a strumpet says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Though bad they be, they will not bate an ace,  
 To be call’d Prudence, Temperance, Faith or Grace."</span>

</div>

   In days gone a "Christom-Child" was one who had recently been
baptized, and died within the month of birth,—the term having originated
in the "face-cloth, or piece of linen put upon the head of a child newly
baptised." The word "chrisom" was formed from the chrism, that is, the
anointing which formed a part of baptism before the Reformation. Thus,
in "King Henry V." (ii. 3), the hostess, Mrs Quickly, means "chrisom
child" in the following passage, where she speaks of Falstaff's
death:—"'A made a finer end, and went away an’ it had been any christom
child." In a beautiful passage of Bishop Taylor's "Holy Dying" (chap. i.
sec. 2), this custom is thus spoken of:—"Every morning creeps out of a
dark cloud, leaving behind it an ignorance and silence deep as midnight,
and undiscerned as are the phantoms that made a chrisom-child to smile."
Referring to the use of the chrisom-cloth in connection with baptism, it
appears that

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

after the usual immersion in water, the priest made a cross on the
child's head with oil, after which the chrisom was put on, the priest
asking at the same time the infant's name, and saying,—"Receive this
white, pure, and holy vestment, which thou shalt wear before the
tribunal of our Lord Jesus Christ, that thou mayest inherit eternal
life. Amen." It was to be worn seven days; but after the Reformation,
however, the use of oil was omitted, and the chrisom was worn by the
child till the mother's churching, when it was returned to the church.
If the child died before the churching, it was buried in the chrisom,
and hence it may be that the child itself was called a chrisom or
chrisomer. <span id="fr_711"></span>[1](#fn_709.md) Thus, it will be seen
that Dame Quickly simply compares the manner of Falstaff's death to that
of a young infant. In Registers and Bills of Mortality we find infants
alluded to under the term "Chrisoms." Burn, in his "History of Parish
Registers," (1862, p. 127), gives the subjoined entry from a register of
Westminster Abbey,—"The Princess Ann's child a chrissome, bu. in
y<sup>e</sup> vault, Oct. 22, 1687."

   In Graunt's "Bills of Mortality," cited in Johnson's "Dictionary," we
read,—"When the convulsions were but few, the number of chrisoms and
infants was greater." The "bearing cloth" was the mantle which generally
covered the child when it was carried to the font. It is noticed in "The
Winter's Tale," (iii. 3), by the shepherd, who, on the discovery of
Paulina, says to the clown,—"Here's a sight for thee; look thee, a
bearing-cloth for a squire's child! look thee here; take up, take up,
boy; open’t." In Stow's "Chronicle," (1631, p. 1039), we are told that
about this time it was not customary "for godfathers and godmothers
generally to give plate at the baptisme of children, but only to give
"christening shirts," with little bands and cuffs, wrought either with
silk or blue thread. The best of them, for chief persons, were edged
with a small lace of black silk and gold, the highest price of which for
great men's children was seldom above a noble, and the common sort, two,
three, or four, and six shillings a piece."
