### CHAPTER VII.

#### ANIMALS.

<span

<span class="smallcaps">As</span> in the case of the birds, considered
in the previous chapter, Shakespeare has also interwoven throughout his
plays an immense deal of curious folk-lore connected with animals. Not
only does he allude with the accuracy of a naturalist to the
peculiarities and habits of certain animals, but so true to nature is he
in his graphic descriptions of them that it is evident his knowledge was
in a great measure acquired from his own observation. It is interesting,
also, to note how carefully he has, here and there, worked into his
narrative some old proverb, or superstition, thereby adding a freshness
to the picture which has, if possible, imbued it with an additional
lustre. In speaking of the dog, he has introduced many an old hunting
custom; and his references to the tears of the deer are full of sweet
pathos, as, for instance, where Hamlet says (iii. 2), "Let the stricken
deer go weep." It is not necessary, however, to add further
illustrations, as these will be found in the following pages.

   *Ape*.—In addition to Shakespeare's mention of this animal as a
common term of contempt, there are several other allusions to it. There
is the well known phrase, "to lead apes in hell," applied to old maids
mentioned in the "Taming of the Shrew" (ii. 1)—the meaning of this term
not having been yet satisfactorily explained. <span
id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_342.md) (It is further discussed in the chapter
on Marriage.)

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

   In "2 Henry IV." (ii. 4), it is used as a term of endearment—"Alas,
poor ape, how thou sweat’st."

   *Ass*.—Beyond the proverbial use of this much ill-treated animal to
denote a silly, foolish person, Shakespeare has said little about it. In
"Troilus and Cressida" (ii. 1), Thersites uses the word "assinego," a
Portuguese expression for a young ass—"Thou hast no more brain than I
have in my elbows; an assinego may tutor thee." It is used by Beaumont
and Fletcher in the "Scornful Lady" (v. 4)—"All this would be forsworn,
and I again an assinego, as your sister left me." <span
id="fr_345"></span>[1](#fn_343.md) Dyce <span
id="fr_346"></span>[2](#fn_344.md) would spell the word "Asinico," because
it is so spelt in the old editions of Shakespeare, and is more in
accordance with the Spanish word. <span id="fr_347"></span>[3](#fn_345.md)
In "King Lear" (i. 4), the Fool alludes to Æsop's celebrated fable of
the old man and his ass—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou borest thine ass on thy back o’er the
dirt."</span>

</div>

   *Bat*.—The bat, immortalised by Shakespeare ("Tempest," v. I) as the
"delicate Ariel's" steed—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"On the bat's back I do fly."</span>

</div>

has generally been an object of superstitious dread, and proved to the
poet and painter a fertile source of images of gloom and terror. <span
id="fr_348"></span>[4](#fn_346.md) In Scotland <span
id="fr_349"></span>[5](#fn_347.md) it is still connected with witchcraft,
and if, while flying, it rise and then descend again earthwards, it is a
sign that the witches’ hour is come—the hour in which they are supposed
to have power over every human being who is not specially shielded from
their influence. Thus in "Macbeth" (iv. 1) the "wool of bat" forms an
ingredient in the witches’ cauldron. One of its popular names is
"rere-mouse," which occurs in a "Midsummer Night's Dream" (ii. 2), where
Titania says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,  
 To make my small elves coats."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This term is
equivalent to the Anglo-Saxon, *hrére-mús*, from *hreran*, to stir,
agitate, and so the same as the old name "flitter-mouse." <span
id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_348.md) The early copies spell the word
*reremise*. <span id="fr_351"></span>[2](#fn_349.md) It occurs in the
Wicliffite versions of Lev. xi. 19, and the plural in the form
"reremees" or "rere-myis" is found in Isaiah ii. 20. At Polperro,
Cornwall, <span id="fr_352"></span>[3](#fn_350.md) the village boys call it
"airy-mouse," and address it in the following rhyme:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Airy mouse, airy mouse! fly over my head,  
 And you shall have a crust of bread;  
 And when I brew, and when I bake,  
 You shall have a piece of my wedding cake."</span>

</div>

In Scotland <span id="fr_353"></span>[4](#fn_351.md) it is known as the
Backe or Bakie bird. An immense deal of curious folk-lore has clustered
round this curious little animal. <span id="fr_354"></span>[5](#fn_352.md)

   *Bear*.—According to an old idea, the bear brings forth unformed
lumps of animated flesh, and then licks them into shape—a vulgar error,
referred to in "3 Henry VI." (iii. 2), where Gloucester, bemoaning his
deformity, says of his mother—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,  
   .        .        .        .        .        .  
 To disproportion me in every part,  
 Like to a chaos, or an unlick’d bear-whelp,  
 That carries no impression like the dam."</span>

</div>

This erroneous notion, however, was long ago confuted by Sir Thomas
Browne. <span id="fr_355"></span>[6](#fn_353.md) Alexander Ross, in his
"Arcana Microcosmi," nevertheless affirms that bears bring forth their
young deformed and mis-shapen, by reason of the thick membrane in which
they are wrapped, that is covered over

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

with a mucous matter. This, he says, the dam contracts in the
winter-time, by lying in hollow caves without motion, so that to the eye
the cub appears like an unformed lump. The above mucilage is afterwards
licked away by the dam, and the membrane broken, whereby that which
before seemed to be unformed appears now in its right shape. This he
contends is all that the ancients meant. <span
id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_354) Ovid (Metam. xv. 379.md) thus describes
this once popular fancy—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nec Catulus partu quem reddidit ursa recenti,  
 Sed male viva caro est. Lambendo mater in artus  
 Fingit, et in formam quantam capit ipsa, reducit."</span>

</div>

   Bears, in days gone by, are reported to have been surprised by means
of a mirror, which they could gaze on, affording their pursuers an
opportunity of taking the surer aim. <span
id="fr_357"></span>[2](#fn_355) In "Julius Cæsar" (ii. 1.md), this practice
is mentioned by Decius—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "Unicorns may be betray’d with trees,  
And bears with glasses."</span>

</div>

   Batman, "Upon Bartholome" (1582), speaking of the bear, says, "And
when he is taken he is made blinde with a bright basin, and bound with
chaynes, and compelled to playe." This, however, says Mr Aldis
Wright, <span id="fr_358"></span>[3](#fn_356.md) probably refers to the
actual blinding of the bear.

   A favourite amusement with our ancestors was bear-baiting. As early
as the reign of Henry II. the baiting of bears by dogs was a popular
game in London, <span id="fr_359"></span>[4](#fn_357.md) whilst at a later
period "a royal bear-ward" was an officer regularly attached to the
royal household. In "2 Henry VI." (v. 1), this personage is alluded to
by Clifford, who says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Are these thy bears? We'll bait thy bears to
death,  
 And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,  
 If thou darest bring them to the baiting place."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And again, in
"Much Ado about Nothing" (ii. 1), Beatrice says, "I will even take
sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell." The
synonymous term, "bear-herd," occurs in "Taming of the Shrew"
(Introduction, scene 2), where Sly speaks of himself as "by
transmutation a bear-herd;" and in "2 Henry IV." (i. 2), Sir John
Falstaff remarks how "true valour is turned bear-herd." Among the
Harleian MSS. <span id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_358.md) is preserved the
original warrant of Richard III. appointing John Brown to this office,
and which recites "the diligent service he had done the king" as the
ground for granting him the privilege of wandering about the country
with his bears and apes, and receiving the "loving benevolence and
favours of the people." <span id="fr_361"></span>[2](#fn_359.md) In the
time of Queen Elizabeth, bear-baiting was still a favourite pastime,
being considered a fashionable entertainment for the ladies of the
highest rank. <span id="fr_362"></span>[3](#fn_360.md) James I. encouraged
this sport. Nichols <span id="fr_363"></span>[4](#fn_361.md) informs us
that on one occasion the king, accompanied by his court, took the Queen,
the Princess Elizabeth, and the two young Princes to the Tower to
witness a fight between a lion and a bear, and by the king's command,
the bear (which had killed a child that had been negligently left in the
bear-house), was afterwards "baited to death upon a stage in the
presence of many spectators." Popular, says Mr Kelly, as bear-baiting
was in the metropolis and at court, it was equally so among all classes
of the people. <span id="fr_364"></span>[5](#fn_362.md) It is on record
that at Congleton, in Cheshire, "the town-bear having died, the
corporation in 1601 gave orders to sell their Bible, in order to
purchase another, which was done, and the town no longer without a
bear." This event is kept up in a popular rhyme—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Congleton rare, Congleton rare,  
 Sold the Bible to pay for a bear."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The same legend
attaches to Clifton, a village near Rugby:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Clifton-upon-Dunsmore, in Warwickshire,  
 Sold the Church Bible to buy a bear."</span>

</div>

   In Pulleyn's "Etymological Compendium," <span
id="fr_365"></span>[1](#fn_363.md) we are told that "this cruel amusement
is of African origin, and was introduced into Europe by the Romans. It
is further alluded to by Shakespeare in "Twelfth Night" (i. 3), "dancing
and bear-baiting;" and further on in the same play (ii. 5) Fabian says,
"he brought me out o’ favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here;"
and Macbeth (v. 7) relates:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,  
 But, bear-like, I must fight the course." <span
id="fr_366"></span>[2](#fn_364.md)</span>

</div>

and in "Julius Cæsar"(iv. 1), Octavius says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "—We are at the stake  
And bay’d about with many enemies."</span>

</div>

   *Boar*.—It appears that in former times boar-hunting was a favourite
recreation; many allusions to which we find in old writers. Indeed, in
the middle ages, the destruction of a wild boar ranked among the deeds
of chivalry, <span id="fr_367"></span>[3](#fn_365.md) and "won for a
warrior almost as much renown as the slaying an enemy in the open
field." So dangerous too, was boar-hunting considered, that Shakespeare
represents Venus as dissuading Adonis from the perilous practice:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O, be advised! thou know’st not what it is,  
 With javelin's point a churlish swine to gore,  
 Whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still,  
 Like to a mortal butcher, bent to kill.  
        \*        \*        \*        \*        \*  
 His brawny sides, with hairy bristles arm’d,  
 Are better proof than thy spear's point can enter;  
 His short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd;  
 Being ireful, on the lion he will venture."</span>

</div>

   Such hunting expeditions were generally fatal to some of the dogs,
and occasionally to one or more of the hunters.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> An old tradition
of Grimsby, in Lincolnshire, <span id="fr_368"></span>[1](#fn_366.md)
asserts that every burgess at his admission to the freedom of the
borough, anciently presented to the mayor a boar's head, or an
equivalent in money, when the animal could not be procured. The old seal
of the mayor of Grimsby represents a boar hunt. The lord, too, of the
adjacent manor of Bradley, was obliged by his tenure to keep a supply of
these animals in his wood, for the entertainment of the mayor and
burgesses. <span id="fr_369"></span>[2](#fn_367.md) A curious triennial
custom called the "Rhyne Toll," is observed at Chetwode, a small village
about five miles from Buckingham. <span id="fr_370"></span>[3](#fn_368.md)
According to tradition, it originated in the destruction of an enormous
wild boar—the terror of the surrounding county—by one of the lords of
Chetwode; who, after fighting with it for four hours on a hot summer's
day, eventually killed it.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Then Sir Ryalas he drawed his broad sword with
might,  
   Wind well thy horn, good hunter;  
 And he fairly cut the boar's head off quite,  
   For he was a jovial hunter."</span>

</div>

As a reward, it is said, the king "granted to him and to his heirs for
ever, among other immunities and privileges, the full right to levy
every year the Rhyne Toll." This is still kept up, and consists of a
yearly tax, on all cattle found within the manor of Chetwode between the
30th October and the 7th November, inclusive. In "Antony and Cleopatra"
(iv. 13) Cleopatra alludes to the famous boar killed by Meleager—"The
boar of Thessaly was never so emboss’d." <span
id="fr_371"></span>[4](#fn_369.md)

   *Bull*.—Once upon a time there was scarcely a town or village of any
magnitude which had not its bull-ring. <span
id="fr_372"></span>[5](#fn_370.md) Indeed, it was not until the year 1835
that baiting was finally

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

put down by an act of Parliament, "forbidding the keeping of any house,
pit, or other place for baiting or fighting any bull, bear, dog, or
other animal;" and after an existence of at least seven centuries, this
ceased to rank among the amusements of the English people. <span
id="fr_373"></span>[1](#fn_371.md) This sport is alluded to in "Merry Wives
of Windsor" (v. 5), "Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa."
We may too compare the expressions in "Troilus and Cressida" (v.
7)—"Now, bull, now, dog!—the bull has the game." <span
id="fr_374"></span>[2](#fn_372.md)

   *Cat*.—Few animals, in times past, have been more esteemed than the
cat, or been honoured with a wider folk-lore. Indeed, among the
Egyptians this favoured animal was held sacred to Isis or the moon, and
worshipped with great ceremony. In the mythology of all the Indo
European nations, the cat holds a prominent place; and its connection
with witches is well known. "The picture of a witch," says Mr
Henderson, <span id="fr_375"></span>[3](#fn_373.md) "is incomplete without
her cat, by rights a black one." In "Macbeth" (iv. i) the First Witch
says—"Thrice the brinded cat hath mew’d,"—it being a common superstition
that the form most generally assumed by the familiar spirits of witches
was the cat. Thus in another passage of the same play (i. 1), the First
Witch says:—"I come, Graymalkin,"—the word otherwise spelt
Grimalkin, <span id="fr_376"></span>[4](#fn_374.md) meaning a grey cat.
Numerous stories are on record of witches having disguised themselves as
cats, in order to carry out their fiendish designs. A woodman out
working in the forest has his dinner every day stolen by a cat.
Exasperated at the continued repetition of the theft, he lies in wait
for the aggressor, and succeeds in cutting off her paw, when lo! on his
return home he finds his wife minus a hand. <span
id="fr_377"></span>[5](#fn_375.md) An honest Yorkshireman, <span
id="fr_378"></span>[6](#fn_376.md) who bred pigs, often lost the young

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

ones. On applying to a certain wise man of Stokesley, he was informed
that they were bewitched by an old woman who lived near. The owner of
the pigs calling to mind that he had often seen a cat prowling about his
yard, decided that this was the old woman in disguise. He watched for
her, and, as soon as she made her appearance, flung at her a poker with
all his might. The cat disappeared, and curiously enough the poor old
woman in question, that night fell and broke her leg. This was
considered as conclusive, that she was the witch that had simulated the
form of a cat. This notion is very prevalent on the Continent. It is
said that witch-cats <span id="fr_379"></span>[1](#fn_377.md) have a great
hankering after beer. Witches are adepts in the art of brewing, and
therefore fond of tasting what their neighbours brew. On these occasions
they always masquerade as cats, and what they steal they consume on the
spot. There was a countryman whose beer was all drunk up by night
whenever he brewed, so that at last he resolved for once to sit up all
night and watch. As he was standing by his brewing pan, a number of cats
made their appearance, and calling to them, he said; "Come, puss, puss,
come, warm you a bit." So in a ring they all sat round the fire as if to
warm themselves. After a time, he asked them "if the water was hot."
"Just on the boil," said they, and, as he spoke he dipped his
long-handled pail in the wort, and soused the whole company with it.
They all vanished at once, but on the following day his wife had a
terribly scalded face, and then he knew who it was that had always drunk
his beer. This story is widely prevalent, and is current among the
Flemish-speaking natives of Belgium. Again, a North German
tradition <span id="fr_380"></span>[2](#fn_378.md) tells us of a peasant
who had three beautiful large cats. A neighbour begged to have one of
them, and obtained it. To accustom it to the place, he shut it up in the
loft. At night, the cat, popping its head through the window, said,
"What shall I bring to-night?" "Thou shalt bring mice," answered the
man. The cat then set to work, and cast all it caught on the floor. Next
morning the place was so full of dead mice that it was hardly possible
to open

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

the door, and the man was employed the whole day in throwing them away
by bushels. At night the cat again asked, 'what shall I bring to night?'
'Thou shalt bring rye,' answered the peasant. The cat was now busily
employed in shooting down rye, so that in the morning the door could not
be opened. The man then discovered that the cat was a witch, and carried
it back to his neighbour." A similar tradition occurs in Scandinavian
mythology. <span id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_379.md) Spranger <span
id="fr_382"></span>[2](#fn_380.md) relates that a labourer, on one
occasion, was attacked by three young ladies in the form of cats, and
that they were wounded by him. On the following day they were found
bleeding in their beds. In Vernon, <span id="fr_383"></span>[3](#fn_381.md)
about the year 1566, "the witches and warlocks gathered in great
multitudes under the shape of cats. Four or five men were attacked in a
lone place by a number of these beasts. The men stood their ground, and
succeeded in slaying one cat, and wounding many others. Next day a
number of wounded women were found in the town, and they gave the judge
an accurate account of all the circumstances connected with their
wounding." It is only natural, then, that Shakespeare in his description
of the witches in "Macbeth," should have associated them with the
popular superstition which represents the cat as their agent—a notion
that no doubt originated in the classic story of Galanthis being turned
into a cat, and becoming, through the compassion of Hecate, her
priestess. From their supposed connection with witchcraft, cats were
formerly often tormented by the ignorant vulgar. Thus it appears <span
id="fr_384"></span>[4](#fn_382.md) that, in days gone by, they
(occasionally fictitious ones) were hung up in baskets and shot at with
arrows. In some counties, too, they were enclosed, with a quantity of
soot, in wooden bottles suspended on a line, and he who could beat out
the bottom of the bottle as he ran under it, and yet escape its
contents, was the hero of the sport. <span
id="fr_385"></span>[5](#fn_383.md) Shakespeare

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

alludes to this practice in "Much Ado about Nothing" (i. 1), where
Benedick says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at
me."</span>

</div>

   Percy, in his "Reliques of Ancient English Poetry" (1794, i. p. 155),
says—"It is still a diversion in Scotland to hang up a cat in a small
cask or firkin, half filled with soot; and then a parcel of clowns on
horseback try to beat out the ends of it, in order to show their
dexterity in escaping before the contents fall upon them."

   This practice was once kept up at Kelso in Scotland, according to
Ebenezer Lazarus, who, in his "Description of Kelso" (1789, p. 144), has
given a graphic description of the whole ceremony. He says—"This is a
sport which was common in the last century at Kelso on the Tweed. A
large concourse of men, women, and children assembled in a field about
half a mile from the town, and a cat having been put into a barrel
stuffed full of soot, was suspended on a crossbeam between two high
poles. A certain number of the whipmen, or husbandmen, who took part in
this savage and unmanly amusement, then kept striking, as they rode to
and fro on horseback, the barrel in which the unfortunate animal was
confined, until at last, under the heavy blows of their clubs and
mallets, it broke, and allowed the cat to drop. The victim was then
seized and tortured to death." He justly stigmatizes it, saying

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The cat in the barrel exhibits such a farce,  
 That he who can relish it is worse than an ass."</span>

</div>

Cats, from their great powers of resistance, are said to have nine
lives; <span id="fr_386"></span>[1](#fn_384.md) hence Mercutio, in "Romeo
and Juliet" (iii. 1), says—"Good king of cats, nothing but one of your
nine lives." Ben Jonson, in "Every Man in His Humour" (iii. 2), makes
Edward Knowell say to Bobadill—"’Twas pity you had not ten; a cat's and
your own." And in Gay's fable of the "Old Woman and her Cats," one of
these animals is introduced, upbraiding the witch

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"’Tis infamy to serve a hag,  
 Cats are thought imps, her broom a nag;  
 And boys against our lives combine,  
 Because ’tis said, your cats have nine."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

   In Marston's "Dutch Courtezan," we read—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Why, then, thou hast nine lives like a cat."</span>

</div>

And in Dekker's "Strange Horse-Race" (1613)—"When the grand Helcat had
gotten these two furies with nine lives." This notion, it may be noted,
is quite the reverse of the well-known saying—"Care will kill a cat,"
mentioned in "Much Ado About Nothing" (v. 1), where Claudio says" What
though care killed a cat."

   For some undiscovered reason a cat was formerly called Tybert or
Tybalt; <span id="fr_387"></span>[1](#fn_385.md) hence some of the
insulting remarks of Mercutio, in "Romeo and Juliet" (iii. 1), who calls
Tybalt "rat catcher" and "king of cats." In the old romance of "Hystorye
of Reynard the Foxe" (chap. vi.), we are told how "the king called for
Sir Tibert, the cat, and said to him, Sir Tibert, you shall go to
Reynard, and summon him the second time." <span
id="fr_388"></span>[2](#fn_386.md) A popular term for a wild cat was
"cat-o’-mountain," an expression <span id="fr_389"></span>[3](#fn_387.md)
borrowed from the Spaniards, who call the wild cat "gato-montes." In the
"Merry Wives of Windsor" (ii. 2), Falstaff says of Pistol—"Your
cat-a-mountain looks."

   The word cat was used as a term of contempt, as in "Tempest" (ii. 1),
and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (iii. 2), where Lysander says, "Hang
off, thou cat." Once more, too, in "Coriolanus" (iv, 2), we find it in
the same sense

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">         "’Twas you incensed the rabble;  
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth,  
As 1 can of those mysteries which heaven  
Will not have earth to know."</span>

</div>

A gib, or a gib cat, is an old male cat <span
id="fr_390"></span>[4](#fn_388.md)—gib being the contraction of
Gilbert, <span id="fr_391"></span>[5](#fn_389.md) and is, says Nares, an
expression exactly analogous to that of a jack-ass. <span
id="fr_392"></span>[6](#fn_390.md) Tom-cat is now the

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

usual term. The word was certainly not bestowed upon a cat early in
life, as is evident from the melancholy character ascribed to it in
Shakespeare's allusion in "1 Henry IV." (i. 2)" I am as melancholy as a
gib cat." Ray gives "as melancholy as a gib’d \[a corruption of gib\]
cat." The term occurs again in "Hamlet" (iii. 4). It is improperly
applied to a female by Beaumont and Fletcher in the "Scornful Lady" (v.
1)—"Bring out the cat-hounds! I'll make you take a tree, whore; then
with my tiller bring down your gib-ship, and then have you cased and
hung up in the warren."

   *Chameleon*.—This animal was popularly believed to feed on air, a
notion which Sir Thomas Browne <span id="fr_393"></span>[1](#fn_391.md) has
carefully discussed. He has assigned, among other grounds for this
vulgar opinion, its power of abstinence and its faculty of
self-inflation. It lives on insects, which it catches by its long gluey
tongue, and crushes between its jaws. It has been ascertained by careful
experiment that the chameleon can live without eating for four months.
It can inflate not only its lungs but its whole body, including even the
feet and tail. In allusion to this supposed characteristic, Shakespeare
makes Hamlet say (iii. 2)—"Of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air,
promise-crammed; you cannot feed capons so;" and in the "Two Gentlemen
of Verona" (ii. 1) Speed says" Though the chameleon, Love, can feed on
the air, I am one that am nourished by my victuals, and would fain have
meat." There is, too, a popular notion that this animal undergoes
frequent changes of colour, according to that of the bodies near it.
This, however, depends on the volition of the animal, or the state of
its feelings, on its good or bad health, and is subordinate to climate,
age, and sex. <span id="fr_394"></span>[2](#fn_392.md) In "3 Henry VI."
(iii. 2), Gloucester boasts—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I can add colours to the chameleon,  
 Change shapes with Proteus for advantages."</span>

</div>

   *Cockatrice*.—This imaginary creature, also called a basilisk, has
been the subject of extraordinary prejudice. It was absurdly said to
proceed from the eggs of old cocks. It has

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

been represented as having eight feet, a crown on the head, and a hooked
and recurved beak. <span id="fr_395"></span>[1](#fn_393.md) Pliny asserts
that the basilisk had a voice so terrible that it struck terror into all
other species. Sir Thomas Browne, <span id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_394.md)
however, distinguishes the cockatrice from the ancient basilisk. He
says—"This of ours is generally described with legs, wings, a serpentine
and winding tail, and a crest or comb somewhat like a cock. But the
basilisk of elder times was a proper kind of serpent, not above three
palms long, as some account; and different from other serpents by
advancing his head and some white marks, or coronary spots upon the
crown, as all authentic writers have delivered." No other animal,
perhaps, has given rise to so many fabulous notions. Thus, it was
supposed to have so deadly an eye as to kill by its very look, to which
Shakespeare very often alludes. In "Romeo and Juliet" (iii. 2), the
latter says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "Say thou but 'I,'  
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more  
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice."</span>

</div>

In "Richard III." (iv. 1) the Duchess exclaims"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O my accursed womb, the bed of death!  
 A cockatrice has thou hatch’d to the world,  
 Whose unavoided eye is murderous."</span>

</div>

In "Lucreece" (1. 540), we read:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Here with a cockatrice's dead-killing-eye  
 He rouseth up himself and makes a pause."</span>

</div>

Once more, <span id="fr_397"></span>[3](#fn_395.md) in "Twelfth Night"
(iii. 4), Sir Toby Belch affirms—"This will so fright them both that
they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices." It has also
been affirmed that this animal could not exercise this faculty, unless
it first perceived the object of its vengeance before it was itself seen
by it—if first seen, it died. Dryden has alluded to this superstition—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Mischiefs are like the cockatrice's eye,  
 If they see first they kill, if seen they die."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

   Cockatrice was a popular phrase for a loose woman, probably from the
fascination of the eye. <span id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_396.md) It
appears, too, that Basilisk <span id="fr_399"></span>[2](#fn_397.md) was
the name of a huge piece of ordnance carrying a ball of very great
weight. In the following passage in "Henry V." (v. 2), there is no doubt
a double allusion—to pieces of ordnance, and to the fabulous creature
already described:—"the fatal balls of murdering basilisks."

   *Colt*.—From its wild tricks, the colt was formerly used to
designate, according to Johnson, "a witless, heady, gay youngster."
Portia mentions it with a quibble in "The Merchant of Venice" (i. 2),
referring to the Neapolitan prince:—"Ay, that's a colt indeed." The term
"to colt," meant to trick, or befool; as in the phrase in "1 Henry IV."
(ii. 2):—"What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?" Mr
Halliwell-Phillipps <span id="fr_400"></span>[3](#fn_398.md) explains the
expression, in "Henry VIII." (i. 2), "Your colt's tooth is not cast
yet," to denote a love of youthful pleasure. In "Cymbeline" (ii. 4), it
is used in a coarser sense:—"She hath been colted by him."

   *Crocodile*.—According to fabulous accounts, the crocodile was the
most deceitful of animals; its tears being proverbially fallacious.
Thus, Othello (iv. 1) says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                          "O devil, devil!  
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,  
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile:  
Out of my sight!"</span>

</div>

We may also compare the words of the queen in "2 Henry VI." (iii. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Henry my lord is cold in great affairs  
 Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's show  
 Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile  
 With sorrow snares relenting passengers."</span>

</div>

   It is said that this treacherous animal weeps over a man's head when
it hath devoured the body, and will then eat up the head too. In
"Bullokar's Expositor," i616, we read:—

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Crocodile
lachrymæ, crocodiles teares, do signify such teares as are feigned, and
spent only with intent to deceive or do harm." In Quarles's "Emblems,"
there is the following allusion:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O what a crocodilian world is this,  
   Compos’d of treachries and ensnaring wiles!  
 She cloaths destruction in a formal kiss,  
   And lodges death in her deceitful smiles."</span>

</div>

In the above passage from "Othello," Singer says, there is, no doubt, a
reference to the doctrine of equivocal generation by which new animals
were supposed to be producible by new combinations of matter. <span
id="fr_401"></span>[1](#fn_399.md)

   *Deer*.—In "King Lear" (iii. 4), Edgar uses deer for wild animals in
general:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"But mice and rats, and such small deer,  
 Have been Tom's food for seven long year."</span>

</div>

Shakespeare frequently refers to the popular sport of hunting the
deer; <span id="fr_402"></span>[2](#fn_400.md) and by his apt allusions
shows how thoroughly familiar he was with the various amusements of his
day. <span id="fr_403"></span>[3](#fn_401) In "Winter's Tale" (i. 2.md),
Leontes speaks of "the mort o’ the deer;" certain notes played on the
horn at the death of the deer, and requiring a deep drawn breath. <span
id="fr_404"></span>[4](#fn_402.md) It was anciently, too, one of the
customs of the chase, for all to stain their hands in the blood of the
deer as a trophy. Thus, in "King John" (ii. 1), the English herald
declares to the men of Angiers how—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Like a jolly troop of huntsmen, come  
 Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,  
 Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes."</span>

</div>

The practice is again alluded to in "Julius Cæsar" (iii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                     "Here thy hunters stand,  
Sign’d in thy spoil, and crimson’d in thy lethe."</span>

</div>

   Old Tuberville gives us the details of this custom—"Our

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

order is, that the prince, or chief, if so please them, do alight, and
take assay of the deer, with a sharp knife, the which is done in this
manner—the deer being laid upon his back, the prince, chief, or such as
they do appoint, comes to it, and the chief huntsman, kneeling if it be
a prince, doth hold the deer by the forefoot, whilst the prince, or
chief, do cut a slit drawn along the brisket of the deer."

   In "Antony and Cleopatra" (v. 2), where Cæsar, speaking of
Cleopatra's death, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                        "Bravest at the last,  
She levell’d at our purposes, and, being royal,  
Took her own way,"</span>

</div>

there is possibly an allusion to the *hart royal* which had the
privilege of roaming unmolested, and of taking its own way to its lair.

   Shooting with the cross-bow at deer was an amusement of great ladies.
Buildings with flat roofs, called stands, partly concealed by bushes,
were erected in the parks for the purpose. Hence the following dialogue
in "Love's Labour's Lost" (iv. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"*Princess*. Then forester, my friend, where is the
bush  
 That we must stand and play the murderer in?  
 *Forester*. Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;  
 A stand where you may make the fairest shoot."</span>

</div>

   Amongst the hunting terms to which Shakespeare refers may be
mentioned the following:—

   "To draw," meant to trace the steps of the game, as in "Comedy of
Errors" (iv. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A hound that runs counter and yet draws dry-foot
well."</span>

</div>

   The term “to run counter” was to mistake the course of the game, or
to turn and pursue the backward trail.”

   The "recheat" denoted certain notes sounded on the horn, properly and
more usually employed to recall the dogs from a wrong scent. It is used
in "Much ado about Nothing" (i. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I will have a recheat winded on my
forehead."</span>

</div>

We may compare Drayton's "Polyolbion" (xiii.):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Recheating with his horn, which then the hunter
cheers."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

   "The phrase 'to recover the wind of me' used by Hamlet (iii. 2) is
borrowed from hunting, and means to get the animal pursued to run with
the wind that it may not scent the toil or its pursuers." Again, when
Falstaff in "2 Henry IV." (ii. 4) speaks of "fat rascals," he alludes to
the phrase of the forest—"rascall," says Puttenham, "being properly the
hunting term given to a young deer leane and out of season."

   The phrase "a hunt's up" implied any song intended to arouse in the
morning,—even a love song—the name having been derived from a tune or
song employed by early hunters. <span id="fr_405"></span>[1](#fn_403.md)
The term occurs in "Romeo and Juliet" (iii. 5) where Juliet says to
Romeo, speaking of the lark—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,  
 Hunting thee hence with hunt's up to the day."</span>

</div>

In Drayton's "Polyolbion" (xiii.) it is used—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"No sooner doth the earth her flowery bosom brave,  
 At such time as the year brings on the pleasant spring,  
 But hunt's-up to the morn the feather’d sylvans sing."</span>

</div>

In Shakespeare's day it was customary to hunt as well after dinner as
before, hence in "Timon of Athens" (ii. 2) Timon says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth
again."</span>

</div>

   The word "embossed" was applied to a deer when foaming at the mouth
from fatigue. In "Taming of the Shrew" (i. ind.) we read—"the poor club
is embossed," and in "Antony and Cleopatra" (iv. 13)—"the boar of
Thessaly was never so emboss’d."

   It was usual to call a pack of hounds "a cry," from the French
*meute* de chiens. The term is humorously applied to any troop or
company of players by Hamlet (iii. 2), who speaks of "a fellowship in a
cry of players." In "Coriolanus," Menenius says (iv. 6)—"You have made
good work, you and your cry."

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

   Antony in "Julius Cæsar" (iii. i) alludes to the technical phrase to
"let slip a dog," employed in hunting the hart. This consisted in
releasing the hounds from the leash or slip of leather by which they
were held in hand until it was judged proper to let them pursue the
animal chased. <span id="fr_406"></span>[1](#fn_404.md) In 1 Henry IV." (i.
3) Northumberland tells Hotspur—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Before the game is afoot, thou still let's
slip."</span>

</div>

In "Taming of the Shrew" (v. 2) Tranio says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O, sir, Lucentio slipp’d me like his greyhound,  
 Which runs himself and catches for his master."</span>

</div>

   A sportsman's saying, applied to hounds, occurs in "2 Henry IV." (v.
3); "a’ will not out; he is true bred," serving to expound Gadshill's
expression, "such as can hold in," "1 Henry IV." (ii. 1).

   The severity of the game laws under our early monarchs was very
stringent; and a clause in the "Forest Charter" <span
id="fr_407"></span>[2](#fn_405.md) grants "to an archbishop, bishop, earl,
or baron, when travelling through the royal forests, at the king's
command, the privilege to kill one deer or two in the sight of the
forester, if he was at hand; if not, they were commanded to cause a horn
to be sounded, that it might not appear as if they had intended to steal
the game." In "Merry Wives of Windsor" (v. 5), Falstaff, using the terms
of the forest, alludes to the perquisites of the keeper. Thus he speaks
of the "shoulders for the fellow of this walk," *i.e.*, the keeper.

   Shakespeare has several pretty allusions to the tears of the deer,
this animal being said to possess a very large secretion of tears. Thus
Hamlet (iii. 2) says—"Let the stricken deer go weep;" and in "As You
Like It" (ii. 1), we read of the "sobbing deer," and in the same scene,
the First Lord narrates how, at a certain spot,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "A poor sequester’d stag  
That from the hunter's aim hath ta’en a hurt  
Did come to languish.    .    .    .    .  
.    .    .    .    And the big round tears  
Coursed one another down his innocent nose  
In piteous chase."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

   Bartholomœus <span id="fr_408"></span>[1](#fn_406.md) says, that "when
the hart is arered, he fleethe to a ryver or ponde, and roreth cryeth
and wepeth when he is take." <span id="fr_409"></span>[2](#fn_407.md) It
appears that there were various superstitions connected with the tears
of the deer. Batman <span id="fr_410"></span>[3](#fn_408.md) tells us that
"when the hart is sick, and hath eaten many serpents for his recoverie,
he is brought unto so great a heate, that he hasteth to the water, and
there covereth his body unto the very eares and eyes, at which time
distilleth many tears from which the \[Bezoar\] stone is
gendered." <span id="fr_411"></span>[4](#fn_409.md) Douce <span
id="fr_412"></span>[5](#fn_410.md) quotes the following passage from the
"Noble Art of Venerie," in which the hart thus addresses the hunter:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O cruel!, be content, to take in worth my tears,  
 Which growe to gumme, and fall from me: content thee with my heares,  
 Content thee with my homes, which every year I new,  
 Since all these three make medicines, some sickness to eschew.  
 My tears congeal’d to gumme, by peeces from me fall,  
 And thee preserve from pestilence, in pomander or ball.  
 Such wholesome tears shedde I, when thou pursewest me so."</span>

</div>

   *Dog*.—As the favourite of our domestic animals, the dog not
unnaturally possesses an extensive history, besides entering largely
into those superstitions which, more or less, are associated with every
stage of human life. It is not surprising, therefore, that Shakespeare
frequently speaks of the dog, making it the subject of many of his
illustrations. Thus he has not omitted to mention the fatal significance
of its howl; which is supposed either to foretell death or misfortune.
In "2 Henry VI." (i. 4), he makes Bolingbroke say—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The time when screech-owls cry and ban dogs
howl <span id="fr_413"></span>[6](#fn_411.md)  
 And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And again, in "3
Henry VI." (v. 6), King Henry, speaking of Gloucester, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The owl shriek’d at thy birth,—an evil sign;  
 The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;  
 Dogs howl’d, and hideous tempests shook down trees."</span>

</div>

The same superstition prevails in France and Germany, <span
id="fr_414"></span>[1](#fn_412.md) and various charms are resorted to for
averting the ill-consequences supposed to attach to this sign of
ill-omen. Several of these, too, are practised in our own country. Thus,
in Staffordshire, when a dog howls, the following advice is given—"Take
off your shoe from the left foot, and spit upon the sole, place it on
the ground bottom upwards, and your foot upon the place you sat upon,
which will not only preserve you from harm, but stop the howling of the
dog." <span id="fr_415"></span>[2](#fn_413.md) A similar remedy is
recommended in Norfolk <span id="fr_416"></span>[3](#fn_414.md)—"Pull off
your left shoe, and turn it, and it will quiet him. A dog won't howl
three times after." We are indebted to antiquity for this superstition;
some of the earliest writers referring to it. Thus, Pausanias relates
how, previous to the destruction of the Messenians, the dogs pierced the
air by raising a louder barking than usual; and it is on record how,
before the sedition in Rome, about the dictatorship of Pompey, there was
an extraordinary howling of dogs. Virgil, <span
id="fr_417"></span>[4](#fn_415) (Georgic i. 470.md), speaking of the Roman
misfortunes, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Obscœnique canes, importunæque volucres  
 Signa dabant."</span>

</div>

Capitolinus narrates, too, how the dogs by their howling presaged the
death of Maximinus. The idea which associates the dog's howl with the
approach of death is probably derived from a conception in Aryan
mythology, which represents a dog as summoning the departing soul.
Indeed, as Mr Fiske <span id="fr_418"></span>[5](#fn_416.md) remarks,
"Throughout all Aryan mythology, the souls of the dead are supposed to
ride on the night-wind, with their

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

howling dogs, gathering into their throng the souls of those just dying
as they pass by their houses."

   Another popular superstition—in all probability derived from the
Egyptians—refers to the setting and rising of Sirius or the dog-star, as
infusing madness into the canine race. Hence the name of the "Dog-days"
was given by the Romans to the period between the 3rd July and the 11th
August, to which Shakespeare alludes in "Henry VIII." (v. 3)—"The
dog-days now reign." We may, too, compare the words of Benvolio in
"Romeo and Juliet" (iii. 1)—"For now, these hot days, is the mad blood
stirring." It is obvious, however, that this superstition is utterly
groundless, for not only does the star vary in its rising, but is later
and later every year. The term "dog-day" is still a common phrase, and
it is difficult to say whether it is from superstitious adherence to old
custom, or from a belief in the injurious effect of heat upon dogs, that
the magistrates, often unwisely, at this season of the year order them
to be muzzled or tied up. It was the practice to put them to death; and
Ben Jonson, in his "Bartholomew Fair," speaks of "the dog-killer" in
this month of August. Lord Bacon, too, in his "Sylva Sylvarum," tells us
that "it is a common experience that dogs know the dog-killer, when, as
in times of infection, some petty fellow is sent out to kill them.
Although they have never seen him before, yet they will all come forth
and bark and fly at him."

   A "curtal dog," to which allusion is made in "Merry Wives of Windsor"
(ii. 1), by Pistol—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs,"</span>

</div>

denoted "originally the dog of an unqualified person, which, by the
forest laws, must have its tail cut short, partly as a mark, and partly
from a notion that the tail of a dog is necessary to him in running." In
later usage, curtail dog means either a common dog, not meant for sport,
or a dog that missed the game, which latter sense it has in the passage
above. <span id="fr_419"></span>[1](#fn_417.md)

   *Dragon*.—As the type and embodiment of the spirit of evil, the
dragon has been made the subject of an extensive

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

legendary lore. The well-known myth of "St George and the Dragon," which
may be regarded as a grand allegory representing the hideous and
powerful monster against whom the Christian soldier is called to fight,
has exercised a remarkable influence for good in times past, over
half-instructed people. It has been truly remarked that "the dullest
mind and hardest heart could not fail to learn from it something of the
hatefulness of evil, the beauty of self-sacrifice, and the
all-conquering might of truth." This graceful conception is alluded to
by Shakespeare in his "King John" (ii. 1), where, according to a long
established custom, it is made a subject for sign-painting <span
id="fr_420"></span>[1](#fn_418.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"St George that swinged the dragon, and e’er
since,  
 Sits on his horseback at mine hostess’ door,  
 Teach us some fence."</span>

</div>

In ancient mythology the task of drawing the chariot of night was
assigned to dragons, on account of their supposed watchfulness. In
"Cymbeline" (ii. 2), Iachimo addressing them says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Swift, swift, you dragons of the night! that
dawning  
 May bare the raven's eye." <span id="fr_421"></span>[2](#fn_419.md)</span>

</div>

   Milton, in his "Il Penseroso," mentions the dragon yoke of night, and
in his "Comus" (l. 130)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "The dragon womb  
Of Stygian darkness."</span>

</div>

   It may be noticed that the whole tribe of serpents sleep with their
eyes open, and so appear to exert a constant watchfulness. <span
id="fr_422"></span>[3](#fn_420.md)

   In devising loathsome ingredients for the witches’ mess, Shakespeare
"Macbeth" (iv. 1), speaks of "the scale of dragon," alluding to the
horror in which this mythical being was held. Referring, also, to the
numerous legends associated with its dread form, he mentions "the spleen
of fiery dragons" ("Richard III." v. 3); "dragon's wings," "1 Henry VI."
(i. 1),

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

and in "Pericles" (i. 1), "death-like dragons." Mr Conway <span
id="fr_423"></span>[1](#fn_421.md) has admirably summed up the general
views respecting this imaginary source of terror:—"Nearly all the dragon
forms, whatever their original types and their region, are represented
in the conventional monster of the European stage, which meets the
popular conception. The dragon is a masterpiece of the popular
imagination, and it required many generations to give it artistic shape.
Every Christmas he appears in some London pantomime, with aspect similar
to that which he has worn for many ages. His body is partly green, with
the memories of the sea and of slime, and partly brown or dark, with
lingering shadow of storm clouds. The lightning flames still in his red
eyes, and flashes from his fire-breathing mouth. The thunderbolt of
Jove, the spear of Wodan, are in the barbed point of his tail. His huge
wings—bat-like, spiked, sum up all the mythical life of extinct harpies
and vampires. Spine of crocodile is on his neck, tail of the serpent,
and all the jagged ridges of rocks and sharp thorns of jungles bristle
around him, while the ice of glaciers and brassy glitter of sunstrokes
are in his scales. He is ideal of all that is hard, obstructive,
perilous, loathe-some, horrible in nature; every detail of him has been
seen through and vanquished by man, here or there, but in selection and
combination they rise again as principles, and conspire to form one
great generalisation of the forms of Pain—the sum of every creature's
worst." <span id="fr_424"></span>[2](#fn_422.md)

   *Elephant*.—According to a vulgar error current in bygone times, the
elephant was supposed to have no joints—a notion which is said to have
been first recorded from tradition by Ctesias the Cnidian. <span
id="fr_425"></span>[3](#fn_423.md) Sir Thomas Browne has entered largely
into this superstition, arguing from reason, anatomy, and general
analogy with other animals, the absurdity of the error. In "Troilus and
Cressida" (ii. 3), Ulysses says:—"the elephant hath joints, but none for
courtesy: his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure." Steevens
quotes from "the Dialogues of Creatures Moralized"—a curious specimen

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

of our early natural history—the following:—"the olefawnte that bowyth
not the kneys." In the play of "All Fools," 1605, we read:—"I hope you
are no elephant—you have joints." In a note to "Sir Thomas Browne's
Works," <span id="fr_426"></span>[1](#fn_424.md) we are told, "it has long
been the custom for the exhibitors of itinerant collections of wild
animals, when showing the elephant, to mention the story of its having
no joints, and its consequent inability to kneel; and they never fail to
think it necessary to demonstrate its untruth by causing the animal to
bend one of its fore-legs, and to kneel also."

   In "Julius Cæsar" (ii. 1), the custom of seducing elephants into
pitfalls, lightly covered with hurdles and turf, on which a proper bait
to tempt them was exposed, is alluded to. <span
id="fr_427"></span>[2](#fn_425.md) Decius speaks of elephants being
betrayed "with holes."

   *Fox*.—It appears that the term fox was a common expression for the
old English weapon, the broad sword of Jonson's days, as distinguished
from the small (foreign) sword. The name was given from the circumstance
that Andrea Ferrara adopted a fox as the blade mark of his weapons—a
practice, since his time, adopted by other foreign sword-cutlers. Swords
with a running fox rudely engraved on the blades, are still occasionally
to be met with in the old curiosity shops of London. <span
id="fr_428"></span>[3](#fn_426) Thus, in "Henry V." (iv. 4.md), Pistol
says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox,  
 Except, O Signieur, thou do give to me  
 Egregious ransom."</span>

</div>

In Ben Jonson's "Bartholomew Fair" (ii. 6), the expression occurs:—"What
would you have, sister, of a fellow that knows nothing but a
basket-hilt, and an old fox in it?"

   The tricks and artifices of a hunted fox were supposed to be very
extraordinary, hence Falstaff makes use of this expression in"1 Henry
IV." (iii. 3):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"No more truth in thee than in a drawn fox."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

   *Goat*.—It is curious that the harmless goat should have had an evil
name, and been associated with devil-lore. Thus, there is a common
superstition in England and Scotland that it is never seen for
twenty-four hours together; and that once in this space, it pays a visit
to the devil in order to have its beard combed. It was, formerly, too, a
popular notion that the devil appeared frequently in the shape of a
goat, which accounted for his horns and tail. Sir Thomas Browne observes
that the goat was the emblem of the sin offering, and is the emblem of
sinful men at the day of judgment. This may, perhaps, account for
Shakespeare's enumerating the "gall of goat" ("Macbeth" iv. 1), among
the ingredients of the witches’ cauldron. His object seems to have been
to include the most distasteful and ill-omened things imaginable—a
practice shared, indeed, by other poets, contemporary with him.

   *Hare*.—This was formerly esteemed a melancholy animal, and its flesh
was supposed to engender melancholy in those who ate it. This idea was
not confined to our own country, but is mentioned by La Fontaine in one
of his "Fables" (Liv. ii. Fab. 14)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Dans un profond ennui ce lievre se plongeoit,  
 Cet animal est triste, et la crainte le rounge."</span>

</div>

and later on 'he says—"Le melancolique animal." Hence, in "1 Henry IV."
(i. 2), Falstaff is told by Prince Henry, that he is as melancholy as a
hare. This notion was not quite forgotten in Swift's time; for in his
"Polite Conversation," Lady Answerall, being asked to eat hare, replies:
"no madam; they say ’tis melancholy meat." Mr Staunton quotes the
following extract from Tuberville's book on "Hunting and Falconry:"—"The
hare first taught us the use of the hearbe called wyld succory, which is
very excellent for those which are disposed to be melancholicke. She
herself is one of the most melancholicke beasts that is, and to heale
her own infirmitie, she goeth commonly to sit under that hearbe."

   The old Greek epigram relating to the hare—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Strike ye my body, now that life is fled:  
 So hares insult the lion when he's dead"</span>

</div>

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

is alluded to by the Bastard in "King John" (ii. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,  
 Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard."</span>

</div>

A [familiar](errata.htm#3.md) expression amongst sportsmen for a hare is
"wat," so called perhaps from its long ears or wattles. In "Venus and
Adonis" the term occurs—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"By this, poor wat, far off upon a hill,  
 Stands on his hinder legs, with listening ear."</span>

</div>

In Drayton's "Polyolbion" (xxiii.), we read—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The man whose vacant mind prepares him to the
sport,  
 The finder sendeth out, to seek out nimble Wat,  
 Which crosseth in the field, each furlong, every flat,  
 Till he this pretty beast upon the form hath found."</span>

</div>

   *Hedgehog*.—The urchin or hedgehog, like the toad, for its
solitariness, the ugliness of its appearance, and from a popular belief
that it sucked or poisoned the udders of cows, was adopted into the
demonologic system; and its shape was sometimes supposed to be assumed
by mischievous elves. <span id="fr_429"></span>[1](#fn_427.md) Hence in the
"Tempest" (i. 2), Prospero says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                          "Urchins  
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,  
All exercise on thee."</span>

</div>

and later on in the same play (ii. 2), Caliban speaks of being frighted
with "urchin shows." In the witch scene in "Macbeth" (iv. 1), the
hedgepig is represented as one of the witches’ familiars; and in the
"Midsummer Night's Dream" (ii. 2), in the incantation of the fairies,
"thorny hedgehogs are exorcised. For the use of urchins in similar
associations we may quote "Merry Wives of Windsor" (iv. 4), "like
urchins, ouphes, and fairies;" and "Titus Andronicus" (ii. 3), "ten
thousand swelling toads, as many urchins." <span
id="fr_430"></span>[2](#fn_428.md) In the phrase still current of "little
urchins" for a child, the idea of the fairy also remains. In various
legends we find this animal holding a prominent place. Thus, for
example, it was in the form of a hedgehog, <span
id="fr_431"></span>[3](#fn_429.md) that the devil is said to have

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

made his attempt to let the sea in through the Brighton Downs, which was
prevented by a light being brought, though the seriousness of the scheme
is still attested in the Devil's Dyke. There is an ancient tradition
that when the devil had smuggled himself into Noah's Ark, he tried to
sink it by boring a hole; but this scheme was defeated, and the human
race saved, by the hedgehog stuffing himself into a hole. In the
Brighton story, as Mr Conway points out, the devil would appear to have
remembered his former failure in drowning people, and to have
appropriated the form which defeated him. In "Richard III." (i. 2), the
hedgehog is used as a term of reproach by Lady Anne, when addressing
Gloucester.

   *Horse*.—Although Shakespeare's allusions to the horse are most
extensive, yet he has said little of the many widespread superstitions,
legends, and traditional tales that have been associated from the
earliest times with this brave and intellectual animal. Indeed, even
now-a-days, both in our own country and abroad, many a fairy tale is
told and credited by the peasantry, in which the horse occupies a
prominent place. It seems to have been a common notion that, at night
time, fairies in their nocturnal revels played various pranks with
horses, often entangling in a thousand knots their hair—a superstition
to which we referred in our chapter on Fairies, where Mercutio, in
"Romeo and Juliet," says, (i. 4):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">              "This is that very Mab  
That plats the manes of horses in the night,  
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,  
Which once entangled much misfortune bodes."</span>

</div>

   In "King Lear" (ii. 3), Edgar says:—"I'll elf all my hair in knots."
Mr Hunt, in his "Popular Romances of the West of England" (1871, p. 87),
tells us that when a boy, he was on a visit at a farmhouse near Fowey
River, and well remembers the farmer with much sorrow, telling the party
one morning at breakfast how "the piskie people had been riding Tom
again." The mane was said to be knotted into fairy stirrups, and the
farmer said he had no doubt that at least twenty small people had sat
upon the horse's neck. Warburton <span id="fr_432"></span>[1](#fn_430.md)
considers that this superstition may have originated from the

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

disease called "Plica Polonica." Witches, too, have generally been
supposed to harass the horse, using it in various ways for their
fiendish purposes. Thus, there are numerous local traditions in which
the horse at night-time has been ridden by the witches, and found in the
morning in an almost prostrate condition, bathed in sweat.

   It was a current notion that a horse hair dropped into corrupted
water would soon become an animal. The fact, however, is that the hair
moves like a living thing, because a number of animalculæ cling to
it. <span id="fr_433"></span>[1](#fn_431.md) This ancient vulgar error is
mentioned in ("Antony and Cleopatra," i. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Much is breeding,  
 Which, like the courser's hair hath yet but life,  
 And not a serpent's poison."</span>

</div>

   Steevens quotes from Churchyard's "Discourse of Rebellion," 1570,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Hit is of kinde much worse than horses heare,  
 That lyes in donge, where on vyle serpents brede."</span>

</div>

   Dr Lister, in the "Philosophical Transactions," says, that these
animated horse-hairs are real thread worms. It was asserted that these
worms moved like serpents, and were poisonous to swallow. Coleridge
tells us it was a common experiment with boys in Cumberland and
Westmoreland, to lay a horse-hair in water, which, when removed after a
time, would twirl round the finger and sensibly compress it—having
become the supporter of an immense number of small slimy water lice.

   A horse is said to have a "cloud in his face," when he has a dark
coloured spot in his forehead between his eyes. This gives him a sour
look, and, being supposed to indicate an ill-temper, is generally
considered a great blemish. This notion is alluded to in "Antony and
Cleopatra" (iii. 2), where Agrippa speaking of Cæsar says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"He has a cloud in’s face,"</span>

</div>

whereupon Enobarbus adds:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"He were the worse for that, were he a horse;  
 So is he, being a man."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

   Burton in his "Anatomy of Melancholy," uses the phrase for the look
of a woman:—"Every lover admires his mistress, though she be very
deformed of herselfe—thin, leane, chitty face, have clouds in her face,"
etc.

"To mose in the chine," a phrase we find in "Taming of the Shrew" (iii.
2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Passened with the glanders, like to mose in the
chine"</span>

</div>

refers to a disorder in horses, also known as "mourning in the chine."

   Alluding to the custom associated with horses, we may note that a
stalking-horse, or stale, was either a real or artificial one, under
cover of which the fowler approached towards and shot at his game. It is
alluded to in "As You Like It" (v. 4), by the Duke, who says of
Touchstone:—"He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under the
presentation of that he shoots his wit." In "Much Ado About Nothing"
(ii. 3), Claudio says:—"Stalk on, stalk on; the fowl sits." <span
id="fr_434"></span>[1](#fn_432) In "Comedy of Errors" (ii. 1.md), Adriana
says:—"I am but his stale," upon which Malone remarks:—"Adriana
undoubtedly means to compare herself to a stalking-horse, behind whom
Antipholus shoots at such game as he selects." In "Taming of the Shrew,"
Katharine says to her father (i. 1):—"Is it your will to make a stale of
me amongst these mates?" which, says Singer, means "make an object of
mockery." So in "3 Henry VI." (iii. 3), Warwick says:—"Had he none else
to make a stale but me?"

   That it was also a hunting term might be shown, adds Dyce, <span
id="fr_435"></span>[2](#fn_433.md) by quotations from various old writers.
In the inventories of the wardrobe belonging to King Henry VIII., we
frequently find the allowance of certain quantities of stuff for the
purpose of making "stalking coats and stalking hose for the use of his
Majesty." <span id="fr_436"></span>[3](#fn_434.md)

   Again, the forehorse of a team was generally gaily ornamented with
tufts, and ribbons, and bells. Hence in "All's

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Well that Ends
Well" (ii. 1), Bertram complains that bedizened like one of these
animals, he will have to squire ladies at the court, instead of
achieving honour in the wars."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,  
 Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,  
 Till honour be bought up and no sword worn  
 But one to dance with."</span>

</div>

   A familiar name for a common horse was "Cut,"—either from its being
docked or gelded—a name occasionally applied to a man as a term of
contempt. In "Twelfth Night" (ii. 3), Sir Toby Belch says:—"Send for
money, knight; if thou hast her not i’ the end, call me cut." In "1
Henry IV." (ii. 1), the carrier says:—"I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's
saddle." We may compare, too, what Falstaff says further on in the same
play (ii. 4), "I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my
face, call me horse." Hence, *call me Cut* is the same as *call me
horse*—both expressions having been used.

In Shakespeare's day, a *race* of horses was the term for what is now
called a stud. So in "Macbeth" (ii. 4), Rosse says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And Duncan's horses—a thing most strange and
certain,  
 Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,  
 Turn’d wild in nature."</span>

</div>

The words "minions of the race," according to Steevens, mean the
favourite horses on the race-ground.

   *Lion*.—The traditions and stories of the darker ages abounded with
examples of the lion's generosity. "Upon the supposition that these acts
of clemency were true, Troilus, in the passage below, reasons not
improperly ("Troilus and Cressida," v. 3) that to spare against reason,
by mere instinct and pity, became rather a generous beast than a wise
man." <span id="fr_437"></span>[1](#fn_435.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,  
 Which better fits a lion, than a man."</span>

</div>

   It is recorded by Pliny <span id="fr_438"></span>[2](#fn_436.md) that
"the lion alone of all wild animals is gentle to those that humble
themselves before him,

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

and will not touch any such upon their submission, but spareth what
creature soever lieth prostrate before him." Hence Spenser's Una,
attended by a lion; and Perceval's Lion, in "Morte Arthur," (b. xiv. c.
6). Bartholomæus says the lion's "mercie is known by many and oft
ensamples: for they spare them that lie on the ground." Shakespeare
again alludes to this notion in "As you Like It" (iv. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                 "For ’tis  
The royal disposition of that beast  
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead."</span>

</div>

   It was also supposed that the lion would not injure a royal prince.
Hence in "1 Henry IV." (ii. 4) the Prince says—"You are lions too, you
ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true prince; no,
fie!" <span id="fr_439"></span>[1](#fn_437.md)\* The same notion is alluded
to by Beaumont and Fletcher in "The Mad Lover" (iv. 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Fetch the Numidian lion I brought over;  
 If she be sprung from royal blood, the lion  
 He'll do you reverence, else—  
   .       .       .       .       .  
 He'll tear her all to pieces."</span>

</div>

According to some commentators there is an allusion in "3 Henry VI." (i.
3) to the practice of confining lions and keeping them without food that
they may devour criminals exposed to them—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"So looks the pent-up lion o’er the wretch  
 That trembles under his devouring paws."</span>

</div>

   *Mole*.—The eyes of the mole are so extremely minute, and so
perfectly hid in its hair, that our ancestors considered it blind—a
vulgar error to which reference is made by Caliban in the "Tempest" (iv.
1)—"Pray you tread softly that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall."
And again by Pericles (i. 1)—"The blind mole casts copp’d hills towards
heaven." Hence the expression "blind as a mole." Alexander Ross <span
id="fr_440"></span>[2](#fn_438.md) absurdly speaks of the mole's eyes as
only the "forms of eyes," given by nature "rather for ornament than for
use; as wings are given to the ostrich which never flies, and a long
tail to the rat, which serves for no other purpose but to be catched
sometimes by it." Sir Thomas Browne, however,

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

in his "Vulgar Errors" (Bk. iii. xviii.) <span
id="fr_441"></span>[1](#fn_439.md) has, with his usual minuteness,
disproved this idea, remarking "that they have eyes in their head is
manifested unto any that wants them not in his own." A popular term for
the mole was the "Moldwarp" or "Mouldiwarp," <span
id="fr_442"></span>[2](#fn_440.md) so called from the Anglo-Saxon, denoting
turning the mould. Thus in "1 Henry IV." (iii. 1) Hotspur says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                  "Sometime he angers me  
With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant."</span>

</div>

   *Mouse*.—This word was formerly used as a term of endearment, from
either sex to the other. In this sense it is used by Rosaline in "Love's
Labour's Lost" (v. 2)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light
word."</span>

</div>

And again in "Hamlet" (iii. 4).

   Some doubt exists as to the exact meaning of "Mouse-hunt," by Lady
Capulet, in "Romeo and Juliet" (iv. 4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time,  
 But I will watch you from such watching now."</span>

</div>

According to some, the expression implies "a hunter of gay-women," mouse
having been used in this signification. <span
id="fr_443"></span>[3](#fn_441.md) Others are of opinion that the
stoat <span id="fr_444"></span>[4](#fn_442.md) is meant, the smallest of
the weasel tribe, and others again the pole-cat. Mr Staunton <span
id="fr_445"></span>[5](#fn_443.md) tells us that the mouse-hunt is the
marten, an animal of the weasel tribe which prowls about for its prey at
night, and is applied to any one of rakish propensities.

   Holinshed in his "History of Scotland" (1577, p. 181) quotes from the
laws of Kenneth II., King of Scotland—"If a sowe eate her pigges, let
hyr be stoned to death and buried, that no man eate of hyr fleshe." This
offence is probably alluded to by Shakespeare in "Macbeth" (iv. 1) where
the witch says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten  
 Her nine farrow."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

   *Pole-Cat, or Fitchew*.—This animal is supposed to be very amorous;
and hence its name, Mr Steevens says, was often applied to ladies of
easy or no virtue. In "Othello" (iv. 1) Cassio calls Bianca a "fitchew,"
and in "Troilus and Cressida" (v. 1) Thersites alludes to it. <span
id="fr_446"></span>[1](#fn_444.md)

   *Porcupine*.—Another name for this animal was the porpentine, which
spelling occurs in "Hamlet" (i. 5). "Like quills upon the fretful
porpentine." And again in "2 Henry IV." (iii. 2) York speaks of "a
sharp-quill’d porpentine." Ajax, too, in "Troilus and Cressida" (ii. 1)
applies the term to Thersites, "do not, porpentine." In the above
passages, however, and elsewhere, the word has been altered by editors
to porcupine. According to a popular error, the porcupine could dart his
quills. They are easily detached, very sharp, and slightly barbed, and
may easily stick to a person's legs, when he is not aware that he is
near enough to touch them. <span id="fr_447"></span>[2](#fn_445.md)

   *Rabbit*.—In "2 Henry IV." (ii. 2), this animal is used as a term of
reproach, a sense in which it was known in Shakespeare's day. The phrase
"Cony-catch," which occurs in "Taming of the Shrew" (v. 1)—"Take heed,
Signior Baptista, lest you be cony-catched in this business," implied
the act of deceiving or cheating a simple person—the cony or rabbit
being considered a foolish animal. <span id="fr_448"></span>[3](#fn_446.md)
It has been shown from Dekker's "English Villanies," that the system of
cheating was carried to a great length in the early part of the
seventeenth century, that a collective society of sharpers was called "a
warren," and their dupes, "rabbit-suckers," *i.e.*, young rabbit or
conies. <span id="fr_449"></span>[4](#fn_447.md) Shakespeare has once used
the term to express harmless roguery, in the "Taming of Shrew" (iv. 1).
When Grumio, will not answer his fellow-servants, except in a jesting
way, Curtis says to him:—"Come, you are so full of cony-catching."

   *Rat*.—The fanciful idea, that rats were commonly rhymed to death, in
Ireland, is said to have arisen from some metrical charm or incantation,
used there for that purpose—to which

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

there are constant allusions in old writers. In the "Merchant of Venice"
(iv. 1), Shylock says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What if my house be troubled with a rat  
 And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats  
 To have it baned?"</span>

</div>

And in "As You Like It" (iii. 2), Rosaline says:—"I was never so
be-rhymed since Pythagoras’ time, that I was an Irish rat, which I can
hardly remember." We find it mentioned by Ben Jonson, in the
"Poetaster," (v. 1)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Rhime them to death, as they do Irish rats,  
 In drumming tunes."</span>

</div>

"The reference, however, is generally referred in Ireland," says Mr
Mackay, "to the supposed potency of the verses pronounced by the
professional rhymers of Ireland, which according to popular
superstition, could not only drive rats to destruction, but could
absolutely turn a man's face to the rack of his head." <span
id="fr_450"></span>[1](#fn_448.md)

Sir W. Temple, in his "Essay on Poetry," seems to derive the idea from
the Runic incantations, for, after speaking of them in various ways, he
adds, "and the proverb of rhyming rats to death, came, I suppose, from
the same root."

According to a superstitious notion of considerable antiquity, rats
leaving a ship are considered indicative of misfortune to a vessel,
probably from the same idea that crows will not build upon trees that
are likely to fall. This idea is noticed by Shakespeare in the "Tempest"
(i. 2), where Prospero, describing the vessel in which himself and
daughter had

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

been placed, with the view to their certain destruction at sea, says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             "They hurried us aboard a bark,  
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared  
A rotten carcass of a boat; not rigg’d,  
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats  
Instinctively had quit it."</span>

</div>

   The *Shipping Gazette* of April 1869 contained a communication
entitled, "A Sailor's Notion About Rats," in which the following passage
occurs—"It is a well-authenticated fact that rats have often been known
to leave ships in the harbour previous to their being lost at sea. Some
of those wiseacres who want to convince us against the evidence of our
senses will call this superstition. As neither I have time, nor you
space, to cavil with such at present, I shall leave them alone in their
glory." The fact, however, as Mr Hardwick has pointed out in his
"Traditions, Superstitions, and Folk-lore" (1872, p. 251), that rats do
sometimes migrate from one ship to another, or from one barn or
corn-stack to another, from various causes, ought to be quite sufficient
to explain such a superstition. Indeed, a story is told of a cunning
Welsh captain who wanted to get rid of rats that infested his ship, then
lying in the Mersey, at Liverpool. Having found out that there was a
vessel laden with cheese in the basin, and getting alongside of her
about dusk, he left all his hatches open, and waited till all the rats
were in his neighbour's ship, and then moved off.

   *Snail*.—A common amusement among children consists in charming
snails, in order to induce them to put out their horns—a couplet, such
as the following, being repeated on the occasion—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Peer out, peer out, peer out of your hole,  
 Or else I'll beat you as black as a coal."</span>

</div>

In Scotland, it is regarded as a token of fine weather if the snail obey
the command and put out its horn <span id="fr_451"></span>[1](#fn_449.md)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Snaffle, snailie, shoot out your horn,  
 And tell us if it will be a bonnie day the morn."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

   Shakespeare alludes to snail-charming in the "Merry Wives of Windsor"
(iv. 2), where Mrs Page says of Mrs Ford's husband, he "so buffets
himself on the forehead, crying, *Peer out! peer out!* that any madness
I ever yet beheld seemed but tameness, civility, and patience, to this
his distemper he is in now." In "Comedy of Errors" (ii. 2), the snail is
used to denote a lazy person.

   *Tiger*.—It was an ancient belief that this animal roared and raged
most furiously in stormy and high winds—a piece of folk-lore alluded to
in "Troilus and Cressida" (i. 3), by Nestor, who says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The herd hath more annoyance by the breese  
 Than by the tiger: but when the splitting wind  
 Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,  
 And flies fled under shade, why, then, the thing of courage,  
 As roused with rage, with rage doth sympathise."</span>

</div>

   *Unicorn*.—In "Julius Caesar" (ii. 1), Decius tells how "unicorns may
be betray’d with trees," alluding to their traditionary mode of capture.
They are reported to have been taken by one, who, running behind a tree,
eluded the violent push the animal was making at him, so that his horn
spent its force on the trunk, and stuck fast, detaining the animal till
he was despatched by the hunter. <span id="fr_452"></span>[1](#fn_450.md)
In Topsell's "History of Beasts" (1658, p. 557), we read of the
unicorn—"He is an enemy to the lions, wherefore, as soon as ever a lion
seeth a unicorn, he runneth to a tree for succour, that so when the
unicorn maketh force at him, he may not only avoid his horn, but also
destroy him; for the unicorn, in the swiftness of his course, runneth
against the tree, wherein his sharp horn sticketh fast, that when the
lion seeth the unicorn fastened by the horn, without all danger he
falleth upon him and killeth him." With this passage we may compare the
following from Spenser's "Fairy Queen" (Bk. ii. canto 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Like as a lyon, whose imperiall power  
 A prowd rebellious unicorn defyes,  
 T’ avoide the rash assault and wrathful stowre  
 Of his fiers foe, him to a tree applyes,</span>

</div>

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span> And when him ronning in full course he spyes,  
 He slips aside: the whiles that furious beast  
 His precious home, sought of his enimyes  
 Strikes in the stocke, ne thence can be releast,  
 But to the mighty victor yields a bounteous feast."</span>

</div>

   *Weasel*.—To meet a weasel was formerly considered a bad omen. <span
id="fr_453"></span>[1](#fn_451.md) That may be a tacit allusion to this
superstition in "Lucrece" (p. 307)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Night wandering weasels shriek to see him there;  
 They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear."</span>

</div>

It appears that weasels were kept in houses, instead of cats, for the
purpose of killing vermin. Phædrus notices this their feline office in
the first and fourth fables of his fourth book. The supposed
quarrelsomeness of this animal is spoken of by Pisanio in "Cymbeline"
(iii. 4), who tells Imogen that she must be "as quarrelous as the
weasel;" and in "2 Henry IV." (ii. 3), Lady Percy says to Hotspur—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen  
 As you are toss’d with."</span>

</div>

   This character of the weasel is not, however, generally mentioned by
naturalists.

and the superstition that arose out of it, seem to have been produced by
a mistranslation by the English-speaking population of a considerable
portion of Ireland, of two Celtic or Gaelic words, *ran*, to *roar*, to
shriek, to bellow, to make a great noise on a wind instrument; and
*rann*, to versify, to rhyme. It is well-known that rats are scared by
any great and persistent noise in the house which they infest. The Saxon
English, as well as Saxon Irish, of Shakespeare's time, confounding
*rann*, a rhyme, with *ran* a *roar*, fell into the error which led to
the English phrase as used by Shakespeare." "Antiquarian Magazine and
