### CHAPTER XVII.

#### DANCES.

<span class="smallcaps">We</span> are indebted to Shakespeare for having
bequeathed to us many interesting allusions to some of the old dances in
use in his day, but which have long ago passed into oblivion. As will be
seen, these were of a very diverse character, but, as has been remarked,
were well suited to the merry-doings of our forefathers; and although in
some cases they justly merited censure for their extravagant nature, yet
the greater part of these sources of diversion were harmless. Indeed, no
more pleasing picture can be imagined than that of a rustic
sheep-shearing gathering in the olden times, when, the work over, the
peasantry joined together in some simple dance, each one vieing with his
neighbour to perform his part with as much grace as possible.

   *Antic*.—This was a grotesque dance. In "Macbeth" (iv. i), the witch,
perceiving how Macbeth is affected by the horrible apparitions which he
has seen, says to her sisters—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,  
 And show the best of our delights.  
 I'll charm the air to give a sound,  
 While you perform your antic round."</span>

</div>

   To quote another instance, Armado, in "Love's Labour's Lost" (v. 1),
says,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"We will have, if this fadge not, an
antique."</span>

</div>

   *Bergomask Dance*.—According to Sir Thomas Hanmer, this was a dance
after the manner of the peasants of Bergomasco, a county in Italy
belonging to the Venetians. All the buffoons in Italy affected to
imitate the ridiculous jargon of that people, and from thence it became
customary to mimic also their manner of dancing. In the "Midsummer
Night's Dream" (v. 1),

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bottom asks
Theseus whether he would like "to hear a Bergomask dance," between two
of their company.

   *Brawl*.—This was a kind of dance. It appears that several persons
united hands in a circle, and gave one another continual shakes, the
steps changing with the tune. With this dance balls were usually
opened. <span id="fr_829"></span>[1](#fn_827.md) Kissing was occasionally
introduced. In "Love's Labour's Lost" (iii. 1), Moth asks his master,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Will you win your love with a French brawl."</span>

</div>

   *Canary*.—This was the name of a sprightly dance, the music to which
consisted of two strains with eight bars in each; an allusion to which
is made by Moth in "Love's Labour's Lost" (iii. i), who speaks of
jigging off a tune at the tongue's end, and canarying to it with the
feet: And in "All's Well that End's Well" (ii. 1), Lafeu tells the king
that he has seen a medicine,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"That's able to breathe life into a stone,  
 Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary  
 With spritely fire and motion."</span>

</div>

This dance is said to have originated in the Canary Islands, an opinion,
however, which has, says Dyce, been disputed. <span
id="fr_830"></span>[2](#fn_828.md)

   *Cinque-Pace*.—This was so named from its steps being regulated by
the number five—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Five was the number of the music's feet,  
 Which still the dance did with five paces meet." <span
id="fr_831"></span>[3](#fn_829.md)</span>

</div>

   In "Much Ado About Nothing" (ii. 1), Shakespeare makes Beatrice make
a quibble upon the term; for after comparing wooing, wedding, and
replating to a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinque-pace, she says—"Then
comes repentance, and, with his bad legs, falls into the cinque-pace
faster and faster, till he sink into his grave." A further reference
occurs in

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Twelfth Night"
(i. 3), by Sir Toby Belch, who calls it a "sink-a-pace."

   *Coranto*.—An allusion to this dance, which appears to have been of a
very lively and rapid character, is made in "Henry V." (iii. 5), where
the Duke of Bourbon describes it as the "swift coranto;" and in "All's
Well That Ends Well" (ii. 3), Lafeu refers to it. A further notice of it
occurs in "Twelfth Night" (i. 3), in the passage where Sir Toby Belch
speaks of "coming home in a coranto."

   *Fading*.—Malone quotes a passage from "Sportive Wit," 1666, which
implies that this was a rustic dance—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The courtiers scorn us country clowns,  
   We country clowns do scorn the court;  
 We can be merry upon the downs  
   As you at midnight with all your sport,  
 With a *fading*, with a fading."</span>

</div>

It would appear, also, from a letter appended to Boswell's edition of
"Malone," that it was an Irish dance, and that it was practised upon
rejoicings as recently as 1803, the date of the letter—

   "This dance is practised on rejoicing occasions in many parts of
Ireland; a king and queen are chosen from amongst the young persons who
are the best dancers; the queen carries a garland composed of two hoops
placed at right angles, and fastened to a handle; the hoops are covered
with flowers and ribbons; you have seen it, I dare say, with the
May-maids. Frequently in the course of the dance the king and queen lift
up their joined hands as high as they can, she still holding the garland
in the other. The most remote couple from the king and queen first pass
under; all the rest of the line linked together follow in succession.
When the last has passed, the king and queen suddenly face about and
front their companions; this is often repeated during the dance, and the
various undulations are pretty enough, resembling the movements of a
serpent. The dancers on the first of May visit such newly married pairs
of a certain rank as have been married since last May-day in the
neighbourhood, who commonly bestow on them a stuffed ball richly decked
with gold and silver lace, and accompanied with a present in

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

money, to regale themselves after the dance. This dance is practised
when the bonfires are lighted up, the queen hailing the return of summer
in a popular Irish song beginning:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"We lead on summer—see! she follows in our
train."</span>

</div>

   In the "Winter's Tale" (iv. 4), Shakespeare seems to allude to this
dance where he makes the servant speaking of the pedlar say—"He has the
prettiest love songs for maids; so without bawdry, which is strange;
with such delicate burthens of *dildos* and fadings, &c." Some
commentators, <span id="fr_832"></span>[1](#fn_830.md) however, consider
that only the song is meant.

   *Hay*.—Douce, <span id="fr_833"></span>[2](#fn_831.md) says, this dance
was borrowed by us from the French, and is classed among the "brawls" in
Thoinot Arbeau's "Orchesographie (1588.) In "Love's Labour's Lost" (v.
1), Dull says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                     "I will play  
On the tabor to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay."</span>

</div>

   *Jig*.—Besides meaning a merry sprightly dance, a jig also implied a
coarse sort of comic entertainment, in which sense it is probably used
by Hamlet (ii. 2); "He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry." "It seems,"
says Mr Collier, <span id="fr_834"></span>[3](#fn_832.md) "to have been a
ludicrous composition in rhyme, sung, or said, by the clown, and
accompanied by dancing and playing upon the pipe and tabor," <span
id="fr_835"></span>[4](#fn_833.md) an instance of which perhaps occurs in
the clown's song at the close of "Twelfth Night"—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When that I was and a little tiny boy," etc.</span>

</div>

   Fletcher in the Prologue to the "Fair Maid of the Inn," says:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A jig should be clapt at, and every rhyme  
 Praised and applauded by a clamorous chime."</span>

</div>

Amongst the allusions to this dance, we may quote one in "Much Ado About
Nothing" (ii. 1), where Beatrice compares

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

wooing to a Scotch jig, and another in "Twelfth Night" (i. 3), where Sir
Toby Belch says, his "very walk should be a jig."

   *Lavolta*.—According to Florio the lavolta is a kind of turning
French dance, in which the man turns the woman round several times, and
then assists her in making a high spring or cabriole. It is thus
described by Sir John Davies:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Yet is there one the most delightfull kind,  
 A loftie jumping, or a leaping round,  
   Where arme in arme two dauncers are entwined,  
 And whine themselves, with strict embracements bound;  
   And still their feet an anapest do sound,  
 An anapest is all their musicks song,  
   Whose first two feet are short, and third is long."</span>

</div>

Douce, <span id="fr_836"></span>[1](#fn_834.md) however, considers it to be
of Italian origin, and says, "it passed from Italy into Provence and the
rest of France, and thence into England." Scot, too, in his "Discovery
of Witchcraft," thus speaks of it:—"He saith, that these night walking
or rather night dancing witches, brought out of Italie into France that
dance which is called *la Volta*. Shakespeare in his "Henry V." (iii.
5), makes the Duke of Bourbon allude to it:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"They bid us to the English dancing-schools,  
 And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos."</span>

</div>

Again in "Troilus and Cressida" (iv. 4), Troilus says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                    "I cannot sing,  
Nor heel the high lavolt."</span>

</div>

   *Light o’ Love*.—This was an old tune of a dance, and was a
proverbial expression for levity especially in love matters. <span
id="fr_837"></span>[2](#fn_835) In "Much Ado About Nothing" (iii. 4.md),
Margaret says: "Clap's into 'light o’ love'; that goes without a burden;
do you sing it, and I'll dance it," to which Beatrice answers, "Ye light
o’ love, with your heels."

   In "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (i. 2), it is alluded to:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">*Julia*—"Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o’
love.'  
*Lucetta*—"It is too heavy for so light a tune."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

   In the "Two Noble Kinsmen" (v. 2), we read:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"He'll dance the Indins twenty mile an hour,  
 And gallops to the tune of Light o’ love."</span>

</div>

And in Beaumont and Fletcher's "Chances" (i. 3), Frederic says, "Sure he
has encounter’d some light-o’-love or other."

   *Pavan*.—This was a grave and majestic dance in which the gentlemen
wore their caps, swords, and mantles, and the ladies their long robes
and twains. The dancers stepped round the room and then crossed in the
middle, trailing their garments on the ground, "the motion whereof,"
says Sir J. Hawkins, "resembled that of a peacock's tail." It is alluded
to in "Twelfth Night" (v. 1) by Sir Toby:—"A passy measures pavin,"
although the reading of this passage is uncertain, the editors of the
"Globe" edition substituting *panyn*.

   It has been conjectured that the "passy measure galliard," and the
"passy measure pavan" were only two different measures of the same
dance, from the Italian *passarezzo*. <span
id="fr_838"></span>[1](#fn_836.md)

   *Roundel*.—This also called the "round," a dance of a circular kind,
and is probably referred to by Titania in the "Midsummer Night's Dream"
(ii. 3), where she says to her twain:— <span
id="fr_839"></span>[2](#fn_837.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Come now, a roundel and a fairy song."</span>

</div>

Ben Jonson, in the "Tale of a Tub," <span
id="fr_840"></span>[3](#fn_838.md) seems to call the rings, which such
fairy dances are supposed to make in the dance, *roundels*.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll have no roundels, I in the queen's
paths."</span>

</div>

   *Satyr's Dance*.—A dance of Satyrs was a not uncommon entertainment
in Shakespeare's day, or even at an earlier period. <span
id="fr_841"></span>[4](#fn_839.md) It was not confined to England, and has
been rendered memorable by the fearful accident with which it was
accompanied at the Court of France in 1392, a graphic description of
which has been recorded by Froissart. In the "Winter's Tale" (iv. 4),
the Satyr's dance is alluded to by the

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Servant, who
says:—"Master, there is three carters, three shepherds, three
neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made themselves all men of
hair; they call themselves Saltiers: and they have a dance which the
wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are not in’t." In
a book of songs, composed by Thomas Ravenscroft and others, in the time
of Shakespeare, we find one <span id="fr_842"></span>[1](#fn_840.md) called
the "Satyres’ daunce." It is for four voices, and as follows:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Round a round, a rounda, keepe your ring  
 To the glorious sunne we sing.  
                              Hoe, hoe!

 He that weares the flaming rayes,  
 And the imperiall crowne of bayes,  
 Him, with him, with shoutes and songs we praise.  
                              Hoe, hoe!

 That in his bountee would vouchsafe to grace  
 The humble sylvanes and their shaggy race."

</div>

   *Sword-Dance*.—In olden times there were several kinds of
sword-dances, most of which afforded opportunities for the display of
skill. In "Antony and Cleopatra" (iii. 4), there seems to be an allusion
to this custom, where Antony, speaking of Cæsar, says:— <span
id="fr_843"></span>[2](#fn_841.md)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">      "He at Philippi kept  
His sword e’en like a dancer."</span>

</div>

And in "All's Well that ends Well" (ii. 1), where Bertram, lamenting
that he is kept from the wars, adds:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,  
 Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,  
 \]Till honour be bought up and no sword worn  
 But one to dance with."</span>

</div>

In "Titus Andronicus" (ii. 1), too, Demetrius says to Chiron:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Why, boy, although your mother, unadvised  
 Gave you a dancing rapier by your side."</span>

</div>

   *Tread a Measure*, to which the King refers in "Love's

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Labour's Lost" (v.
2), when he tells Boyet to tell Rosaline—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">     "We have measured many miles,  
To tread a measure with her on this grass,"</span>

</div>

was a grave solemn dance, with slow and measured steps like the minuet.
As it was of so solemn a nature it was performed <span
id="fr_844"></span>[1](#fn_842.md) at public entertainments in the Inns of
Court, and it was "not unusual, nor thought inconsistent, for the first
characters in the law to bear a part in treading a measure."

   *Trip and Go* was the name of a favourite Morris dance, and appears,
says Mr Chappell, in his "Popular Music of the Olden Times, &c." (2nd
edition, i. p. 131), to have become a proverbial expression. It is used
in "Love's Labour's Lost" (iv. 2).

   *Up-spring*.—From the following passage, in Chapman's "Alphonsus,
Emperor of Germany," it would seem that this was a German dance:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"We Germans have no changes in our dances;  
 An almain and an up-spring, that is all."</span>

</div>

Karl Elze, <span id="fr_845"></span>[2](#fn_843.md) who, a few years ago,
reprinted Chapman's "Alphonsus" at Leipzig, says that the word
"up-spring" "is the 'Hüpfauf,' the last and wildest dance at the old
German merry-makings. No epithet could there be more appropriate to this
drunken dance than Shakespeare's *swaggering*" in "Hamlet" (i. 4):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The King doth wake to-night, and takes his rouse,  
 Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels."</span>

</div>
