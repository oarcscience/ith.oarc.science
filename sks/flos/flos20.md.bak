### CHAPTER XVIII.

#### PUNISHMENTS.

<span class="smallcaps">Shakespeare</span> has not omitted to notice
many of the punishments which were in use in years gone by; the
scattered allusions to these being interesting in so far as they serve
to illustrate the domestic manners and customs of our forefathers.
Happily, however, these cruel tortures, which darken the pages of
history, have long ago passed into oblivion; and at the present day it
is difficult to believe that such barbarous practices could ever have
been tolerated in any civilized country. The horrible punishment of
"boiling to death," is mentioned in "Twelfth Night" (ii. 5), where
Fabian says—"If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to
death with melancholy." In "Winter's Tale" (iii. 2), Paulina inquires:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?  
 What wheels! racks? fires? What flaying? boiling?  
 In leads or oils? What old or newer torture  
 Must I receive?"</span>

</div>

   There seems to be an indirect allusion to this punishment in "The Two
Noble Kinsmen" (iv. 3), where the gaoler's daughter in her madness
speaks of those who "are mad, or hang, or drown themselves, being put
into a cauldron of lead and usurer's grease, and there boiling like a
gammon of bacon that will never be enough."

   The practice of holding burning basons before the eyes of captives to
destroy their eyesight, is probably alluded to by Macbeth (iv. 1), in
the passage where the apparitions are presented to him by the witches—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo; down!  
 Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs." <span
id="fr_846"></span>[1](#fn_844.md)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

   In "Antony and Cleopatra" (ii. 4), soaking in brine as a punishment,
is referred to by Cleopatra, who says to the messenger—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Thou shall be whipp’d with wire, and stew’d in
brine,  
 Smarting in lingering pickle."</span>

</div>

Drowning by the tide, a method of punishing criminals, is probably
noticed in the "Tempest" (i. 1), by Antonio—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:  
 This wide-chapp’d rascal—would thou mightst lie drowning  
 The washing of ten tides."</span>

</div>

   *Baffle*.—This was formerly a punishment of infamy inflicted on
recreant knights, one part of which consisted in hanging them up by the
heels, to which Falstaff probably refers in "1 Henry IV." (i. 2), where
he says to the Prince, "Call me villain, and baffle me." And further on
(ii. 4)—"If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically, both in word
and matter, hang me up by the heels for a rabbet-sucker, or a poulter's
hare." <span id="fr_847"></span>[1](#fn_845) In "2 Henry IV." (i. 2.md),
the Chief-Justice tells Falstaff that "to punish him by the heels would
amend the attention of his ears." And in "All's Well that Ends Well"
(iv. 3), where the lord relates how Parolles has "sat in the stocks all
night," Bertram says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"His heels hath deserved it, in usurping his spurs
so long."</span>

</div>

   Spenser in his "Faerie Queene" (vi. 7), thus describes this mode of
punishment—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"And after all for greater infamie  
 He by the heels him hung upon a tree,  
 And baffl’d so, that all which passed by  
 The picture of his punishment might see."</span>

</div>

The appropriate term, too, for chopping off the spurs of a knight when
he was to be degraded, was "hack"—a custom to which it has been
suggested, Mrs Page alludes in the "Merry Wives of Windsor" (ii.
1) <span id="fr_848"></span>[2](#fn_846.md)—"What—Sir Alice Ford! these
knights will hack, and so thou should’st not alter the article of thy
gentry." <span id="fr_849"></span>[3](#fn_847.md)

   Mr Dyce, <span id="fr_850"></span>[4](#fn_848.md) however, says the most
probable meaning of

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

this obscure passage is that, "there is an allusion to the extravagant
number of knights created by King James, and that hack is equivalent to
"become cheap or vulgar."

It appears, too, that in days gone by, the arms, etc., of traitors and
rebels might be defaced. Thus, in "King Richard II." (ii. 3), Berkeley
tells Bolingbroke—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Mistake me not, my lord; ’tis not my meaning  
 To raze one title of your honour out."</span>

</div>

Upon which passage we may quote from Camden's "Remains" (1605, p.
186)—"How the names of them, which for capital crimes against majestie,
were erased out of the public records, tables, and registers or
forbidden to be borne by their posteritie, when their memory was damned,
I could show at large." In the following Act (iii. 1), Bolingbroke
further relates how his enemies had—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Dispark’d my parks and fell’d my forest woods,  
 From my own windows torn my household coat,  
 Razed out my impress, leaving me no sign."</span>

</div>

   *Bilboes*.—These were a kind of stocks or fetters used at sea to
confine prisoners, of which Hamlet speaks to Horatio (v. 2):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,  
 That would not let me sleep: methought I lay  
 Worse than the mutines in the bilboes."</span>

</div>

This punishment is thus described by Steevens: "The *bilboes* is a bar
of iron with fetters annexed to it, by which mutinous or disorderly
sailors were anciently linked together. The word is derived from Bilboa,
a place in Spain where instruments of steel were fabricated in the
utmost perfection. To understand Shakespeare's allusion completely, it
should be known that, as these fetters connect the legs of the offenders
very close together, their attempts to rest must be as fruitless as
those of Hamlet, in whose mind 'there was a kind of fighting that would
not let him sleep.' Every motion of one must disturb his partner in
confinement. The bilboes are still shown in the Tower of London, among
the other spoils of the Spanish Armada." <span
id="fr_851"></span>[1](#fn_849.md)

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

   *Brand*—The branding of criminals is indirectly alluded to in "2
Henry VI.," (v. 2), by young Clifford who calls the Duke of Richmond "a
foul stigmatick," which properly meant "a person who had been branded
with a hot iron for some crime, one notably defamed for naughtiness."
The practice was abolished by law in the year 1822.

   The practice, too, of making persons convicted of perjury wear papers
while undergoing punishment, descriptive of their offence, is spoken of
in "Love's Labour's Lost" (iv. 3), where Biron says of Longaville:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing
papers."</span>

</div>

   Holingshed relates how Wolsey "so punished a perjure with open
punishment, and open paper wearing, that in his time it was disused."

   *Breech*.—This old term to whip or punish as a school-boy is noticed
in the "Taming of the Shrew" (iii. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am no breeching scholar in the schools,  
 I'll not be tied to hours nor ’pointed times."</span>

</div>

breeching being equivalent to "liable to be whipped."

   In "Merry Wives of Windsor" (iv. 1), Sir Hugh Evans tells the boy
page:—"If you forget your 'quies,' your 'quæs,' and your 'quods,' you
must be preeches" (breeched).

   *Crown*.—A burning crown, as the punishment of regicides, or other
criminals, is probably alluded to by Anne in "Richard III.," (iv. 1):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I would to God that the inclusive verge  
 Of golden metal that must round my brow!  
 Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain."</span>

</div>

   Mr Singer, <span id="fr_852"></span>[1](#fn_850.md) in a note on this
passage quotes from Chettle's "Tragedy of Hoffman" (1631), where this
punishment is introduced:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Fix on thy master's head my burning crown."</span>

</div>

And again—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                       "Was adjudg’d  
To have his head sear’d with a burning crown."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

   The Earl of Athol, who was executed for the murder of James I. of
Scotland, was before his death crowned with a hot iron. In some of the
monkish accounts of a place of future torments, a burning crown is
appropriated to those who deprived any lawful monarch of his kingdom.

   *Pillory*.—This old mode of punishment is referred to by Launce in
the "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (iv. 4), where he speaks of having "stood
on the pillory." In "Taming of the Shrew" (ii. 1), Hortensio, when he
tells Baptista how he had been struck by Katharina because "I did but
tell her she mistook her pets," adds:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "She struck me on the head,  
And through the instrument my pate made way;  
And there I stood amazed for awhile,  
As on a pillory, looking through the lute."</span>

</div>

   It has been suggested that there may be an illusion to the pillory in
"Measure for Measure" (v. 1), where Lucio says to the duke disguised in
his friar's hood: "You must be hooded, must you? Show your knave's
visage, with a pox to you! Show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an
hour! "The alleged crime was not capital, and suspension in the pillory
for an hour was all that the speaker intended." <span
id="fr_853"></span>[1](#fn_851.md)

   *Press*.—Several allusions occur to this species of torture applied
to contumacious felons. It was also, says Malone, "formerly inflicted on
those persons, who, being indicted, refused to plead. In consequence of
their silence, they were pressed to death by a heavy weight laid upon
the stomach." In "Much Ado about Nothing" (iii. 1), Hero says of
Beatrice—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                   "She would laugh me  
Out of myself, press me to death with wit."</span>

</div>

   In "Richard II." (iii. 4), the Queen exclaims—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"O, I am press’d to death through want of
speaking."</span>

</div>

And in "Measure for Measure" (v. 1), Lucio tells the Duke that—"Marrying
a punk, my lord, is pressing to death, whipping, and hanging."

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

   In the "Perfect Account of the Daily Intelligence" (April 16th,
1651), we find it recorded—"Mond., April 14th. This Session, at the Old
Bailey, were four men pressed to death that were all in one robbery,
and, out of obstinacy and contempt of the Court, stood mute and refused
to plead." This punishment was not abolished until by Statute 12 Geo.
III. c. 20.

   *Rack*.—According to Mr Blackstone, this "was utterly unknown to the
law of England; though once, when the Duke of Exeter and Suffolk, and
other ministers of Henry VI., had laid a design to introduce the civil
law into this kingdom as a rule of government, for the beginning thereof
they erected a rack of torture, which was called, in derision, the Duke
of Exeter's daughter; and still remains in the Tower of London, where it
was occasionally used as an engine of state, not of law, more than once
in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. But when upon the assassination of
Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, it was proposed, in the Privy Council, to
put the assassin to the rack, in order to discover his accomplices, the
judges (being consulted) declared unanimously, to their own honour and
the honour of the English law, that no such proceeding was allowable by
the law of England." Mr Hallam observes, that though the English law
never recognized the use of torture, yet there were many instances of
its employment in the reign of Elizabeth and James; and among others, in
the case of the Gunpowder Plot. He further adds, in the latter part of
the reign of Elizabeth "the rack seldom stood idle in the Tower." Of the
many allusions to this torture, may be mentioned Sebastian's word in
"Twelfth Night" (v. 1)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Antonio! O my dear Antonio!  
 How have the hours rack’d and tortured me,  
 Since I have lost thee."</span>

</div>

   In "Measure for Measure" (v. 1), Escalus orders the "unreverend and
unhallow’d friar" (the Duke disguised) to be taken to the rack—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Take him hence; to the rack with him! we'll touse
you  
 Joint by joint."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

   The engine, which sometimes meant the rack, is spoken of in "King
Lear" (i. 4)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"That, like an engine, wrench’d my frame of nature  
 From the fix’d place." <span id="fr_854"></span>[1](#fn_852.md)</span>

</div>

So in Beaumont and Fletcher's "Night Walker" (iv. 5)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Their souls shot through with adders, torn on
engines."</span>

</div>

Once more in "Measure for Measure" (ii. 1), where Escalus tells how

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Some run from brakes of ice, and answer
none."</span>

</div>

—a passage which Mr Dyce would thus read—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Some run from brakes of vice."</span>

</div>

   It has been suggested that there is an allusion to "engines of
torture," although owing to the many significations of the word "brake,"
its meaning here has been much disputed. <span
id="fr_855"></span>[2](#fn_853.md)

   *Stocks*.—This old-fashioned mode of punishment is the subject of
frequent allusion by Shakespeare. Thus, Launce in "The Two Gentlemen of
Verona" (iv. 4), says—"I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath
stolen." In "All's Well that Ends Well" (iv. 3), Bertram says—"Come,
bring forth this counterfeit module, has deceived me, like a
double-meaning prophesier." Whereupon one of the French lords
adds—"Bring him forth: has sat i’ the stocks all night, poor gallant
knave." Volumnia says of Coriolanus (v. 3)—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                      "There's no man in the world  
More bound to’s mother; yet here he lets me prate  
Like one i’ the stocks."</span>

</div>

Again, in "Comedy of Errors" (iii. 1), Luce speaks of "a pair of stocks
in the town," and in "King Lear" (ii. 2), Cornwall, referring to Kent,
says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">           "Fetch forth the stocks!  
You stubborn ancient knave."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

   It would seem that formerly in great houses, as in some colleges,
there were moveable stocks for the correction of the servants. Putting a
person in the stocks, too, was an exhibition familiar to the ancient
stage. In "Hick Scorner," <span id="fr_856"></span>[1](#fn_854.md) printed
in the reign of Henry VIII., Pity is placed into the stocks, and left
there until he is freed "by Perseverance and Contemplacyon."

   *Strappado*.—This was a military punishment by which the unfortunate
sufferer was cruelly tortured in the following way:—A rope being
fastened under his arms, he was drawn up by a pulley to the top of a
high beam, and then suddenly let down with a jerk. The result, usually,
was a dislocation of the shoulder blade. In "1 Henry IV." (ii. 4), it is
referred to by Falstaff, who tells Poins:—"Were I at the strappado, or
all the racks in the world, I would not tell you on compulsion." At
Paris, says Douce, <span id="fr_857"></span>[2](#fn_855.md) "there was a
spot called *l’estrapade*, in the Fauxbourg St. Jacques, where soldiers
received this punishment. The machine, whence the place took its name,
remained fixed like a perpetual gallows." The term is probably derived
from the Italian *strappare*, to pull or draw with violence.

   *Toss in a Sieve*.—This punishment, according to Cotgrave, was
inflicted "on such as committed gross absurdities." In "1 King Henry
VI." (i. 3), Gloster says to the Bishop of Winchester:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll canvass thee in thy broad Cardinal's hat,  
 If thou proceed in this thy insolence."</span>

</div>

It is alluded to in Davenant's "Cruel Brother" (1630):—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I'll sift and winow him in an old hat."</span>

</div>

   *Wheel*.—The punishment of the wheel was not known at Rome, but we
read of Mettius Tuffetius being torn asunder by quadrigœ driven in
opposite directions. As Shakespeare, remarks Malone, "has coupled this
species of punishment with another that certainly was unknown to ancient
Rome,

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

it is highly probable that he was not apprized of the story of Mettius
Tuffetius, and that in this, as in various other instances, the practice
of his own times was in his thoughts, for in 1594 John Chastel had been
thus executed in France for attempting to assassinate Henry IV."

   Coriolanus (iii. 2) says—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Let them put all about mine ears, present me  
 Death on the wheel, or at wild horses’ heels."</span>

</div>

   *Whipping*.—Three centuries ago this mode of punishment was carried
to a cruel extent. By an Act passed in "2 Henry VIII." vagrants were to
be carried to some market-town, or other place, and there tied to the
end of a cart, naked, and beaten with whips throughout such market-town,
or other place, till the body should be bloody by reason of such
whipping." The punishment was afterwards slightly mitigated, for by a
statute passed in 39th of Elizabeth's reign, vagrants "were only to be
stripped naked from the middle upwards, and whipped till the body should
be bloody." The stocks were often so constructed as to serve both for
stocks and whipping posts. <span id="fr_858"></span>[1](#fn_856.md) Amongst
the numerous references to this punishment by Shakespeare, we may quote
"2 Henry IV." (v. 4), where the beadle says of Hostess Quickly:—"The
constables have delivered her over to me, and she shall have
whipping—cheer enough, I warrant her." In "The Taming of the Shrew" (i.
1), Gremio says, speaking of Katharina, "I had as lief take her dowry
with this condition, to be whipped at the high cross every morning," in
allusion to what Hortensio had just said, "Why, man, there be good
fellows in the world, an a man could light on them, would take her with
all faults, and money enough." In "2 Henry VI." (ii. 1), Gloucester
orders Simpcox and his wife to "be whipped through every market-town,
till they come to Berwick, from whence they came."

   *Wisp*.—This was a punishment for a scold. <span
id="fr_859"></span>[2](#fn_857.md) It appears that "a wisp, or small twist
of straw or hay, was often applied as a mark of opprobrium to an
immodest woman, a scold, or similar offender; even, therefore, the
showing it

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

to a woman, was considered a grievous affront." In "3 Henry VI." (ii.
2), Edward says of Queen Margaret:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,  
 To make this shameless callet <span id="fr_860"></span>[1](#fn_858.md)
know herself."</span>

</div>

A wisp, adds Nares, seems to have been the badge of the scolding woman
in the ceremony of Skimmington; <span id="fr_861"></span>[2](#fn_859.md) an
allusion to which is given in a "Dialogue between John and Jone,
striving who shall wear the breeches," in the "Pleasures of Poetry,"
cited by Malone:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Good, gentle Jone, with-holde thy handes,  
   This once let me entreat thee,  
 And make me promise never more,  
   That thou shalt mind to beat me:  
 For fear thou wear the wispe, good wife,  
   And make our neighbours ride."</span>

</div>

   In Nash's "Pierce Pennilesse" (1593), there is also an amusing
allusion to it, "Why, thou errant butter-whore, thou cotquean and
scrattop of scolds, wilt thou never leave afflicting a dead carcasse?
continually read the rhetorick lecture of Ramme-alley? a wispe, a wispe,
you kitchen-stuffe wrangler."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                                  "A callat  
Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband

</div>

<span id="fn_859"></span>[415:2](flos20.htm#fr_861.md) Skimmington was a
